  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the three-millionth time, Soap wipes the fog off his scope with a damp swipe of his sticky glove. Sure as shit as the sky is blue, it fogs right back up again, no thanks to this god awful climate.</p>\n<p>He mutters under his breath, \u201cJesus Christ, the swamp ass is fuckin\u2019 boggin\u2019 out here.\u201d And sure as shit as Brazil is humid, Ghost answers through the coms,</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s attractive.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap snorts in reply. He huffs another breath to push some of the camouflage away from his nose, and adjusts the grip on his sniper rifle. Ugh, his hands are sweating through the gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis position\u2019s pure shit, L.t. Pretty sure I\u2019m growin\u2019 mold between my toes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWatch out for leeches.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, I\u2019ll save one just for you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cEyes up, sergeant,\u201d </em>says Ghost, and gee, Soap sure would love to, if he could fucking see.</p>\n<p>Ah, well. Not the first time he\u2019s flown in the blind. The shell plops into the water behind him, a flock of birds take off into the sky, and a body falls into the murky river.</p>\n<p>\u201cTarget down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s voice is like butter in his ear. If he was fuckin\u2019 stupid, he\u2019d almost say it sounded like a purr. <em>\u201cNice shot.\u201d </em>He smugly preens, until Ghost continues, <em>\u201cHangfire until the rest of the party comes through. I\u2019m on coms with Command.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Soap internally groans. A bit externally too, if he\u2019s being honest, \u2018cause he\u2019s half in the mud, damp and sticky and <em>so </em>fucking ready to get out of this damn rainforest.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell. We still secure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAlways, Johnny.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Some of the anger shifts into light agitation. He feels a bit like a dog that\u2019s been pat on the head. Fuck if Ghost doesn\u2019t know how to work him over by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou owe me a new pair of socks after this.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a short pause, as if Ghost switched channels to report back to command, before coming through crystal clear in his ear again.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou wrap this up tight, and I\u2019ll buy you more than a pair of socks.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap laughs quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, you taking me out to dinner, L.t? Got me kickin\u2019 my feet like a school girl over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s tone is flat, deep, and thickly English as always, and yet it still tickles him when he replies,</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDrinks, MacTavish. Get your mind out of the gutter \u2013 not looking to get lucky with you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>A boat comes through the river, but it\u2019s not the search party. Soap holds his breath until the motor passes, then whispers,</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missin\u2019 out. Rumor has it I put out on the first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMm, that all? Heard worse rumors than that back in the S.A.S.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap actually perks. It disturbs the water around him, and a fish darts away. He curses lightly, then sinks back to the bank again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat rumors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSecond boat coming through.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGhost, what rumors?\u201d Soap tries again, in a harsh whisper. He can hear the click through the coms; the safety on Ghost\u2019s gun. \u201cIt\u2019s about my sparkling personality and my massive cock, right? <em>Right?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cCertainly none of those things,\u201d </em>says Ghost. <em>\u201cI don\u2019t kiss and tell my watercooler gossip.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s face feels hot.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t always this bad. Somehow, what began as innocent, lighthearted banter, has now devolved into notoriously bad flirting. It started in Las Almas all those months ago, and now it\u2019s so heavily engrained into their work relationship, it would almost be weirder if it stopped. The mindless chatter helps him stay calm when the time bomb\u2019s clickin\u2019, but it also keeps him warm, and edgy. Probably not a bad thing either, except for the raging hard-ons.</p>\n<p>\n<em>It's funny because we\u2019re straight. Ha Ha. Funny jokes. Hilarious irony in our secure masculinity.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Riiiight.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCommand says pull the pin. Look alive, Soap.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI see it,\u201d Soap grumbles. The boat comes tutting through, Soap trips the wire strung through the trees, and then it\u2019s bye-bye terrorists. At least the explosion is satisfying.</p>\n<p>Ghost, ever his guardian devil, takes out a lone straggler that jumped. The shot comes somewhere from the trees. Soap feels like he got the short end of the stick as far as hiding spots go, and he\u2019s about to open his mouth and say so, when Ghost speaks first.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy, Johnny. Drinks on me.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The heat cracks through his skull, washes through his gut and down to his miserable feet. Soap barely manages to croak out a response to that.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019 not a cheap date, just warning you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d </em>A pause, then, <em>\u201cGoing to get us patched back to command. Be prepared to report in.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Also known as, <em>behave, soldier.</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s short static through the line, until Laswell\u2019s voice comes in clear.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBravo 7-1, this is Watcher-1 how copy.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWatcher-1, three explosives discharged, seven confirmed dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cGood job, Soap. Load up the bodies and prepare for extraction.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCopy,\u201d Soap says, and hears Ghost echo it in his ear.</p>\n<p>He crawls out of the mud with a very long and dramatic groan; and far, far away, from the corner of his eye, he sees Ghost climb out of a tree like fucking tarzan.</p>\n<p>Their communication line must be closed again, because Ghost says, <em>\u201cDon\u2019t cream yourself before you hit the showers. Can\u2019t blame that one on the mud.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Soap stops mid moan. He shakes out some of the guck and says, \u201cYou\u2019re a dick, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou\u2019d like one, wouldn\u2019t you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Insubordination be damned, he\u2019s going to have a heart attack and die.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shut <em>up</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost doesn\u2019t laugh, like, ever. But he breathes heavily out of his nose (maybe the labor of crawling down from a tree, maybe a chuckle at Soap\u2019s expense). Either way, Soap can pretend his name will stay off the report.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one problem with whatever the hell kind of fucked up comradery they\u2019ve got going on, it\u2019s that the teasing goes full stop as soon as they step foot on base.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all straight backed, chin up, <em>yes sir </em>kinda\u2019 bullshit. All good and proper and cold, like a soldier should be, and sweet Jesus does Soap hate it.</p>\n<p>They check in their weapons, sit through debrief, sign all the paperwork and dot their T\u2019s and smudge their I\u2019s and <em>maybe</em> three hours later, Soap is finally scrubbing the river filth out of his hair.</p>\n<p>Soap pulls on a clean shirt, and Ghost walks right on by him, not even a fuckin\u2019 glance. Sure, there\u2019s professionalism, and then there\u2019s that <em>good boy </em>that purred in his ears. He\u2019s totally cracked.</p>\n<p>Gaz slaps him on the shoulder, and it scares the shit right out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, good to see the piranhas didn\u2019t nibble off your toes. Can\u2019t afford to lose any more inches, am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck <em>off, </em>I\u2019ll give ya a fuckin\u2019 nibble<em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Gaz laughs. He looks happy, probably because he got to sit back at base while the rest of them got dirty.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Price is popping bottles, that\u2019ll cheer you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap glances down to the private showers, where Ghost is giving him the cold shoulder. Gaz leads him out with an arm around his neck, so he goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap is military, so he could sleep on a rusty bed of nails if he had to, but there\u2019s still a noticeable difference between their temporary camps pitched in some random nook n\u2019 cranny of the world, and their base command.</p>\n<p>He collapses onto his worn in, delightfully mosquito-free bed. Happy to have his own room again, he lies flat on his back, and stares at the white ceiling.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been radio silence the whole flight home. Just the normal load ins, load outs. He tried to get a word in on the dock, but Ghost got snatched up by command real quick, and Soap sure isn\u2019t looking for trouble that quick off the job.</p>\n<p>Truth is, Soap doesn\u2019t know much about Ghost. Besides the missing riddles of his fucked-up past, his <em>chipper</em> personality, and his commitment to hiding away his face; Soap knows him as a reliable teammate, maybe a friend under the right lighting (Ghost would argue otherwise), and yet he hardly understands him at all.</p>\n<p>Ghost makes him feel green again, like some recruit that can\u2019t tell his tits from his arse. Not many get to wear the title of \u2018living legend\u2019, but some of the privates used to rumor that Ghost isn\u2019t even alive at all.</p>\n<p>A load of horse shit, but pretty strange nonetheless. How many dead bodies can you stand over, before you\u2019re no longer human?</p>\n<p>Soap feels warm when he thinks about the way it feels to have Ghost on his six. Out in the field, or safe at HQ, Ghost has eyes on anything that dares to breathe. Soap knows what it\u2019s like to be under that microscope. It kinda\u2019 turns him on.</p>\n<p>Soap runs his hands down his face and sighs.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I need to get laid.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The local pub has just enough overstimulation to make him feel scrubbed from the starchy barracks.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pool ball clatters into a bucket, people cheer at the sports game above the bar, and Soap stares warily into the bottle of cheap beer he\u2019s drinking. Not his choice, of course, but thanks to the man that\u2019s been checking him out for the last hour.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not really his type; very thin, prestigious, and fashionable. He looks like some trust-fund baby that owns his own start-up \u2013 but hey, this close to base, beggars can\u2019t be choosers (and Soap would rather <em>die </em>than sleep with one of the fresh SAS privates \u2013 no exaggeration whatsoever).</p>\n<p>Well, he\u2019s not ugly, and Soap\u2019s gonna\u2019 sit on something tonight, standards be damned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSoo\u2026you travel a lot?\u201d Not-Ugly asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Soap mentally maps out the quickest way to cut the small talk and get back to a hotel. At least he can bang his head into the pillows when he\u2019s in doggy. \u201cWell, I \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>A knife slides into the wooden table like butter. Soap tenses for all of three seconds, hand moving for the strap concealed under his belt, before he sees a broad-set figure he could recognize in his sleep. A bar stool screeches unpleasantly as it\u2019s dragged away from another table. Soap holds in a sigh as Ghost takes a heavy seat.</p>\n<p>His \u2018date\u2019, for lack of a better word, turns in wide-eyed surprise. He opens his mouth as if to argue, but one look at Ghost\u2019s cold, murderous eyes, and the kid is slapping down change and running out the door. It chimes. Soap puffs out a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust showing off my new knife,\u201d Ghost says innocently, pulling his blade out clean. He twirls it around in his fingers, before handing it to Soap hilt-first. \u201cYou know \u2018em?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap glances to the pub door and back.</p>\n<p>Okay, he\u2019s not exactly <em>in </em>the closet, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s both heels out of it either. Not like sexual preference is an important discussion topic when you\u2019re getting shipped all over the world to do the government\u2019s dirty work; but also, Soap is a little reluctant to make it known. Like maybe, Ghost would stop letting his hair down around him, if he knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah.\u201d Soap balances the knife on his finger. It is indeed new. The blade is shiny, sharp, with ridged edges just how Ghost likes it. Good for cutting throats, and even better for torture. \u201cNice cutter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. Are you really drinking horse piss?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap turns the Busch bottle around to show that it\u2019s full.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. You here to buy me that drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA promise is a promise,\u201d says Ghost. He\u2019s not wearing the balaclava, or the skull plate, but instead a pair of sunglasses and a paper face mask. A baseball cap hides his hair, and Soap is a little bitter about it. Sensing his stare, Ghost removes his glasses, and Soap gets a wonderful view into the stone-cold windows of his stone-cold soul. He leans over to wave at the bartender, \u201cHey, Maria. One bourbon, one scotch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bartender nods, wiping her hands off on the bar towel. Soap sighs dreamily, and slides his head in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know me so well, dearest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite his deadpan tone, Ghost\u2019s eyes hold a small shine of humor in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it. I shouldn\u2019t have to tempt my teammates just to get a job well done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap grins, \u201cI\u2019m <em>always </em>a job well done. You just like spending time with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost goes <em>hrm, </em>which sounds like a disagreement, but Soap will pretend it\u2019s not. He skillfully plucks the knife back out of Soap\u2019s other hand. He flips it through his fingers, and then it\u2019s gone, like a magic trick. Two scotch glasses are set at the table, and Soap makes a relieved sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy it while you can,\u201d Ghost says. He grabs his glass with long, tattooed fingers. It almost feels risqu\u00e9 to see his bare hands. Neatly trimmed nails, and scars across his knuckles from one-too many fights. \u201cLaswell is shipping us out again next Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap starts to ask, \u201cWhere\u2026?\u201d But he quickly corrects himself at Ghost\u2019s long look. \u201cAh, not here. Should be sober by then, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>In one fluid motion, Ghost lifts the bottom of his mask and drinks with the same hand, perfectly hiding his mouth in the meantime, and dragging the mask back over his chin as he pulls away.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould be.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve drank together before. But he always feels weird about it, because Ghost only ever has one round, and Soap can go to the moon and beyond. Something about substance abuse running in the family. Not uncommon around here \u2013 but funny, how the usual response is <em>I don\u2019t touch the stuff. </em>Not a man like Ghost. He always has <em>one </em>cigarette, <em>one </em>drink, <em>one </em>bite of the poison apple, just to prove he can bite back harder. He\u2019s the ultimate symbol of willpower. He\u2019s also kind of frightening.</p>\n<p>With his head tipped down, the bill of the baseball cap covers his eyes again. Soap doesn\u2019t like that, so he makes an attempt to gain back his attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou going home? A week\u2019s long enough to get away from base, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I was, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Ghost tips his head up, and Soap feels relieved to see his gaze again. His eyes look open, but far away. Almost tired. \u201cI\u2019m damn close to giving up my flat in Manchester. Waste of money that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap grins, nudging his barstool with the toe of his boot.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon now, no hot babe back at home waiting for her knight in Riley armor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny,\u201d Ghost says, though the look in his eyes says otherwise. \u201cAnd no time for romance, MacTavish, you know this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, but I mourn all the ladies out there that won\u2019t get to enjoy your charming personality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my stunning good looks, don\u2019t forget,\u201d Ghost says. Soap gives a surprised laugh, and tops off his scotch. Ghost waves the bartender over for another one, and Soap could just fucking kiss him.</p>\n<p>He wishes he saw this side of Ghost more often. But also, he feels strangely privileged to see it now.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the more reason to take the mask off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost raises an eyebrow; thin, silver, so blonde it\u2019s almost white.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you footin\u2019 the bill. You\u2019re in no position to be making demands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap feels hot under the collar again. Maybe it\u2019s the rush of <em>real </em>alcohol, or maybe it\u2019s the sound of Ghost muttering in his collied accent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Soap shrugs, grinning. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen all my positions yet. I\u2019m pretty flexible.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t earn him a laugh, but Ghost does roll his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cStand down, soldier.\u201d</p>\n<p>The flirting is all in good fun. Soap finishes his second drink, and they watch the rest of the game on T.V. Ghost rests back against the barstool with his boot hooked on his knee, arms crossed, biceps flexing in his army regulation tee, long-eyelashes blinking neutrally as he looks between the door, and the screen \u2013 all the more ignorant to how quickly Soap would crawl under that table and sink to his knees, should he ever ask.</p>\n<p>Soap rubs a finger under his nose and sniffles.</p>\n<p>Ah, well. Rest in peace his sex life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t make special forces without missing a few important parts of your brain-bits. Adrenaline-junkies, masochists, pyromaniacs, obsessive compulsive disorders; it\u2019s not personal, just plain math. Nobody with a functioning frontal cortex is going to sneak into an Irani control tower to hijack nuclear codes in the dead of night under risk of a new world war. Well, unless you\u2019re crazy enough to be in the 141.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap sits in the watchtower, rifle between his knees and his night-vision goggles set square on Ghost as he scales a wall in one easy hop. Tall fucker and his long ass legs, Soap totally could have made that jump.</p>\n<p>Ghost slits the throat of a guard, and as Soap warns him of a second in the hall, he throws another blade right between their eyes. The body hits concrete, and Soap whistles lowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was sexy, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYeah? That does it for you?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, half-chub at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOnly half? Guess I better step it up.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother guard on your right. Grab \u2018em with your legs, I\u2019ll go full mast.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore, Johnny.\u201d </em>He snaps their neck, and pulls the body into a bush. His voice comes out slightly labored, and husky. <em>\u201cAlthough, it sounds like you\u2019re a bit of a masochist.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The way Ghost says his name is just downright filthy. It rolls off silky, familiar. Almost sweet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho isn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019d hate to see the spank bank you\u2019re keeping.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap bites the corner of his lip, then laughs under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, afraid you\u2019ll like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Price\u2019s sharp voice comes through the coms like cold water.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou two are disgusting. Sergeant, Lieutenant \u2013 please focus so I can go home and forget this ever happened.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m focused!\u201d Soap scoffs, offended.</p>\n<p>Soap directs his binoculars to Price on the opposite end of the property, where he\u2019s hiding by the fence line.</p>\n<p>Ghost trusts Price probably more than he trusts Soap. He\u2019s also the only other living being in the army that has seen any semblance of Ghost\u2019s personality. Price always knows more than he lets on. Probably for the best.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still no movement by the west gate, so he returns to Ghost just in time to watch him stab another artery with perfect execution. Soap wasn\u2019t lying; he is actually half-hard. Something about the way Ghost glides so quietly through a battlefield at night, all skilled instinct and textbook efficiency. That\u2019s sex appeal if Soap has ever seen it. One-hundred percent all organic military cock-fuel.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019ve got eyes on target. Soap, how copy.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTrigger on your mark, L.t.\u201d Soap pulls the detonator out of his pocket. \u201cOnce this blows, be ready to run like hell.\u201d He lifts his binoculars again, this time watching Ghost bend over to plant charges on the concrete wall. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you have a great ass?\u201d</p>\n<p>Price groans, <em>\u201cJesus, MacTavish.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>He then sees Ghost pause to grab his mic and say, <em>\u201cYes, actually. In Catania.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cTch, figures. Fucking Italians. You know I\u2019ve got an uncle in Rome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cReally?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cJust blow the damn wall,\u201d </em>Price snaps. Soap laughs, and Ghost gives a calm order through the coms. It explodes in a horrible fire of smoke and concrete. He waits for the inevitable;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFuck me.\u201d\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cStill alive, L.t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFortunately for you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGive \u2018em hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, when Price calls him into his quarters to sign the mission statement, he crosses his arms and leans against his desk like a disgruntled father.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got issues, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap gives a quick signature to his report, and smirks as he hands it over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like poking bears, or is Ghost just special?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap wants to say something smart, but knows better not to. He shifts slightly, folding his hands behind his back.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of teasing. All in good fun, Captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one in the 141 is particularly good at sticking to the book (Price included), so Soap doesn\u2019t worry about any misconduct reports. Still, the flat look from Price is just as bad. He puffs smoke out of his cigar, and rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna\u2019 say shit. Just watch yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap hesitates on the way out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get hurt,\u201d Price corrects. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what fire you\u2019re playing with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap shifts uncomfortably, suddenly feeling seen. He tries to laugh it off.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh. Get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sweats a bit when he gets back to his bunk. Ghost walks on by to the mess hall like he\u2019s strolling to the park. Soap is in dire need of some plausible deniability.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it fuck your mum?\u201d Ghost asks.</p>\n<p>Soap nearly jumps out of his skin and bones. There\u2019s only one soul on base that\u2019s quiet enough to sneak up on him, and it\u2019s always Simon Riley.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He steadies the punching bag, and shakes out his sore hand. Ah, he was going a bit hard, but they\u2019re still another week out until they get a break, and Soap\u2019s got more pent-up frustration than a shaken coke bottle.</p>\n<p>Ghost bangs his fist against the metal support rod, and after a loud <em>clunk, </em>Soap realizes he had punched the peg out of alignment. He runs his hand across his damp mohawk and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cImpressed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConcerned. You better keep up tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMahh, I\u2019ll be fine. Just burning energy, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hums neutrally, and flings his sweat towel over his broad shoulder. Soap always tries to avoid eye contact in the gym mirror while he\u2019s lifting weights, because Ghost\u2019s shirt always sticks to his stomach like something out of magic mike. The lad\u2019s fuckin\u2019 shredded, and even just looking at him now, Soap suddenly has a whole new wave of vigor to burn off. There\u2019s a gap between his balaclava and his army green shirt, and Soap wants to lick the sweat out of his shiny collarbones.</p>\n<p>Nova speaks up from the weight rack, setting down the bar and rolling out her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, MacTavish. I\u2019ll spar with ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s a new transfer to the base; highly decorated, and pretty damn hot. Soap looks her up and down, weighs his chances, and decides <em>what the hell.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ghost says, before Soap can even formulate an answer. He grabs him strongly by the shoulder, and Soap\u2019s eyes nearly bug out of his head. \u201cI\u2019ll wear him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Double entendres aside, Soap blanches. He jerks his head up to meet Ghost\u2019s sharp gaze \u2013 his grey eyes squint in a challenge, and Soap feels his heart sink to his knees. He doesn\u2019t look amused. Nova submits almost immediately, fleeing back to the squat rack to avoid Ghost\u2019s killer glare. Soap\u2019s stomach starts to cramp.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ah. I\u2019m going to die.</em>\n</p>\n<p>A hell of a way to go. Soap pats him on the back and starts towards the ring, teasing, \u201cThink you can keep up? I can go all night.\u201d He really is a Masochist. Ghost cracks his knuckles with a single squeeze of his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain if you\u2019re sore tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mind is so far in the gutter, he might as well board his ticket to hell. Ghost is dressed as casual as Soap will ever see him; grey trackies, a plain balaclava, and dog tags hanging out of his shirt. It\u2019s a true testament to Soap\u2019s willpower that he manages to keep his eyes above the waist while Ghost swings a leg into the ring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap gets his ass handed to him. He manages to get a few good hits in, and a kick strong enough for Ghost to grunt from the impact (despite it feeling like he\u2019s smacking a concrete wall).</p>\n<p>He goes to bed with the same problem he woke up with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some American idiot slipped the wrong file into the wrong hands, so Price\u2019s squad is called in to do the dirty work.</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be nice to throw money at every inconvenient problem,\u201d Soap mutters. His semi-auto is pointed down a long, dimly lit hallway. \u201cWhy follow the rules when you can pay someone to clean up your mess...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that where you get the name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s voice is much closer than usual. He\u2019s looking up something on the satellite, a hand resting on Soap\u2019s shoulder while he punches in numbers. At the end of the day, they still work best together, so in lieu of results, command keeps sending them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gaz buzzes in.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThe room is clear. Soap, Ghost, you\u2019re good to move.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCopy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost pockets the touchpad and raises his gun again, and together they move down the hall. The building is full of reflective glass, each shadow making him jumpy. Something about this mission already stinks to high hell, and they all know it. Together, Soap and Ghost clear rooms until they find the office they\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got thirty minutes until security is back online,\u201d Ghost whispers. He holds the door open, and Soap tucks inside. \u201cRed file, zed alpha\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m lookin\u2019 for,\u201d Soap snaps. He uses the false thumbprint to start pulling open file cabinets. \u201cSheesh. You\u2019d think a private investigator would be living a little less lavishly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost props his shoulder in the doorway, his rifle lowered. He checks the hall every so often, but turns his body to face Soap.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re brains for hire, not so different than us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDifferent paycheck, I\u2019m betting,\u201d Soap grumbles. \u201cSteamin\u2019 hell, where is this thing\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He can hear the smirk on Ghost\u2019s face as he mutters, \u201cYou need me to read for you, too? Needy little thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A tingle runs down the back of his spine. Soap uses every cell of discipline not to shudder. He yanks open another file cabinet in a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you <em>like </em>to feel needed. The way you\u2019re always running to Price\u2019s office, looking for a bone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called being responsible, MacTavish, you should try it sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mood feels different; bickering like this in the same room, rather than over the coms. Soap\u2019s thumb runs down an alphabetical file until he finds the section he\u2019s looking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost got it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d says Ghost.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure now\u2019s the time \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean <em>fuck,</em>\u201d Ghost hisses. He slams the door shut and begins to yank down all the window shudders. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cGhost! Soap! Two civilians headed your way, fast. Do not kill, I repeat, do not kill!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking see that!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit shit shit!\u201d Soap slams the cabinet shut, and starts to run his hand along the window for a lock. \u201cGhost, we\u2019re sixty floors up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Talking starts to echo from the hall. Soap looks up for any sign of ductwork. He nearly has his neck snapped off when Ghost grabs him by the strap of his vest, and yanks him into a supply closet.</p>\n<p>They fall on top of each other. Soap slaps a hand against the wall to keep his gun from ramming into Ghost\u2019s face. Ghost slams the door shut just in time, because the footsteps grow louder.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014 then I\u2026huh. I don\u2019t remember leaving this light on.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWho cares, just take your pants off.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Ohh shit.</p>\n<p>Soap sucks in a breath. He searches for Ghost\u2019s eyes in the dark, and sees him staring back, equally wide-eyed. They\u2019re both trying to catch their breath, both trying to stay quiet, while the sound of a belt buckle rings out like a gunshot.</p>\n<p>One male, one female. Light streams under the crack of the closet door. Soap hopes the guy\u2019s a quickie, because this closet is three-feet wide at best, and he already knows his thighs are going to cramp from the awkward position, hovered over Ghost\u2019s lap like this.</p>\n<p>Ghost breathes in, then out, like he\u2019s getting himself under control. Soap respects his mental fortitude, because he\u2019s definitely on the edge of freaking out. Their cargo packs are pressed together. Soap makes a signal with his hand, and Ghost nods. Through teamwork, Ghost is able to take the gun out of his hand, and position it somewhere by his thigh, so it won\u2019t clatter when Soap readjusts himself against the wall. It takes some of the strain off.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014 mm, fuuck. Ah! Ah, Annie\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap squeezes his eyes shut in frustration. This sucks.</p>\n<p>He can feel something by his foot, maybe a mop or a bucket. One bad move, and they\u2019re fucked. Ghost continues to breathe steadily against him, and when a hand squeezes his arm, he realizes Ghost is trying to keep him calm.</p>\n<p>The moaning gets louder through the door. Office supplies clatter, and the woman gasps.</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s nose is right by Ghost\u2019s ear. He can smell the sweat on him, the military regulated detergent they use in the laundry, and a cologne that\u2019s gone old. He smells like fucking <em>sex, </em>and he\u2019s in his <em>lap, </em>and Soap\u2019s brain chooses that lovely moment to remind him how long it\u2019s been since he got laid.</p>\n<p>He grinds his teeth so they squeak. Ghost tips his head slightly, and whispers so, so quietly, it feels like a prayer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLean on me, Soap. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost is flat on his butt. The angle is probably none too comfortable for his long ass legs, but at least he\u2019s not in a half squat. Again, Ghost encourages him to push more weight on him. He settles for his shoulder, instead of his lap.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh! Oh! Oh my god!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Skin slaps skin. Soap\u2019s stomach curls with the horrifying realization that he\u2019s getting hard.</p>\n<p>He wills it away with every random thought. Blisters on his feet. Cramping in his arm. The discomfort of the utility straps rubbing into his thighs. His feet are going numb. Sweat is running down his temple. His pants feel tight,<em> fuck fuck fuck.</em></p>\n<p>Ghost keeps a careful grip on his arm to hold him steady. His pale eyelashes catch in the light streaming through the crack in the door. Soap sees down the back of his neck, where a shoulder tattoo peeks under his shirt collar. Soap physically feels his cock start to fill.</p>\n<p>The moaning is loud and obscene and honestly, a little over-dramatic for his tastes. She\u2019s totally faking an orgasm, and the guy is falling for it. More noise, a bang of the cabinet as they change positions. His erection rests uncomfortably against his zipper, and he hopes to all fuck that Ghost can\u2019t see in the dark.</p>\n<p>Because God hates him, Ghost shifts his leg to keep it from going numb. Soap sucks in a breath so hard, it sounds like a hiss.</p>\n<p>They both freeze.</p>\n<p>Soap closes his eyes, hoping that if he astral projects hard enough, he\u2019ll wake up in a hospital somewhere, and this\u2019ll all be over. Ghost exhales a long, calculated breath.</p>\n<p>An agonizing silence, chorused by the sounds of muffled sex.</p>\n<p>A thigh grinds deliberately between his legs. Soap lets out a sharp gasp, and Ghost\u2019s hand flies over his mouth to suppress it.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t see Ghost\u2019s eyes anymore. They\u2019re hidden, where he\u2019s tipped his head away. Soap waits long enough to see if the world is about to end, and after a long, quiet second, Ghost yanks impatiently at his arm as if to say \u2013 <em>sit.</em></p>\n<p>Ahh fuck. Fucking hell.</p>\n<p>His thighs shake as he finally rests his weight fully on Ghost\u2019s lap. His head hangs at the pressure, a long-needed relief to the ache between his legs. He lets Ghost hold the palm over his mouth, keeps his hand slapped up against the wall, and just sits there. Throbbing, panting, so fucking hard there\u2019s no way Ghost can\u2019t feel the entire shape of him.</p>\n<p>The moaning gets louder and louder. Ghost\u2019s gloved hand leaves his arm, and finds a new grip on the strap at his thigh. He gives a hard, firm tug, and Soap moans again into his palm.</p>\n<p>His glove smells like gunmetal. Soap is so nasty, he wants to lick it. His thigh is all muscle between his legs \u2013 and quietly, selfishly, Soap rubs up against him. Ghost doesn\u2019t stop him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to die. Adrenaline and arousal are crossing in his brain, sending mixed signals all over his body. Given enough time, he could cum like this.</p>\n<p>Soap shivers.</p>\n<p>Ghost nudges him slightly.</p>\n<p>His cock pulses, throbs \u2013 his hands shake, his breath gets short against Ghost\u2019s glove. He jerks up his thigh again, and Soap bites his thumb. The profile of the mask is turning him on. He can feel Ghost watching him.</p>\n<p>Just as his stomach starts to tighten in that world shattering, <em>oh shit </em>kind of way \u2013 the office goes silent.</p>\n<p>Soap holds his breath. The talking gets quiet. He can hear a belt being picked up, some laughter, the shuffling of papers.</p>\n<p>The light clicks off.</p>\n<p>Soap falls back and sags against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBravo team, this is Watcher-1. Both civilians are moving back to the elevator. Are you secure?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap bravely raises his gaze towards Ghost. His expression is entirely unreadable. The whites of his eyes glow in the dark, like a predator on the other end of a cage.</p>\n<p>Ghost slowly grabs his mic. \u201cWatcher-1, we\u2019re secure. RTB in five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCopy that.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other for three long seconds.</p>\n<p>Ghost gets his legs under himself and stands, opening the door to the outside world. Fresh air rushes in, and it feels like a cold shower.</p>\n<p>His voice is a bit husky when he says, \u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d He grabs both guns, tossing one to Soap.</p>\n<p>Soap swallows twice before he can croak, \u201cRight. Right.\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk about it. If Ghost glances between his legs, then Soap doesn\u2019t notice. They grab the file, get to the ground floor, and drive back to the rendezvous.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bouncing around in the back of the van, Soap folds his hands between his knees, and stares out the window. He can\u2019t take the tension. Ghost is resting casual in his seat, gun in hand, eyes forwards, and Soap feels like he\u2019s going to split in two from the nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cGhost,\u201d Soap says, rusty. \u201cAbout the uh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d Ghost grunts. \u201cNothin\u2019 to be said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026That\u2019s it?</p>\n<p><em>I humped your thigh in a closet, </em>Soap thinks. <em>Pretty sure that doesn\u2019t \u2018just happen\u2019.</em></p>\n<p>The mission isn\u2019t quite over yet, and Gaz is driving in the front seat, so Soap sees it for the out that it is, and takes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, cool.\u201d He rubs his nose, and leans back against the window. \u201cLad sounded like a shit lay, aye?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hums, \u201cShe definitely faked that orgasm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The feds stuck their temporary base out in rural Arizona, so they have to share pop-up tents for the time being. The squad hangs around in the dirt as Laswell runs them through the stolen files via video call. True to his name, Ghost hovers back in the dark, arms crossed, hip popped up against one of the canteen tables.</p>\n<p>Feeling edgy, Soap pulls out a cigarette and lights it. He can feel Ghost watching him, so he offers, \u201cCig?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost turns to look at him. He doesn\u2019t answer; only takes the cigarette (only ever one), and lets Soap light it for him. He rolls up the mask just enough to put the stick in his mouth, and Soap\u2019s heart races just from seeing the scruff on his jaw. It\u2019s dark as shit in the desert \u2013 hard to get a good look at him \u2013 but Soap can see his jaw flex as he puffs out smoke. Soap looks away, and does the same.</p>\n<p>Ghost seems pretty set on acting like nothing happened, so Soap plays along. Getting hard in a closet is probably real low on Ghost\u2019s list of shit to care about. Still, Soap kinda\u2019 wishes it meant more than it did.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Price curses, fist slamming down by the laptop. \u201cThat lying <em>cunt.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Gaz jerks upright, from where he was nodding off at the table. Soap passes him the other half of his cigarette and mutters, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ghost grunts, giving Soap a hard clap on the shoulder. \u201cGet comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks to some good old-fashioned betrayal, they\u2019re stuck in the states on a man hunt. Soap was hoping they\u2019d wrap this up fast so they could helo home and forget any of this ever happened \u2013 but here they are, staked out in some ghost town, shootin\u2019 the shit until the shit shoots back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHot as the devil out here,\u201d Soap mumbles. He found an old wooden chair and pulled it up against the busted window he\u2019s sniping out of. The sun\u2019s blazing, making it hard to stare out at the deserted main-street for too long. He wipes the sweat off his forehead with this arm, pushing the longer strands of his mohawk out of his face.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWould you prefer the rainforest?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap briefly closes his eyes when he hears Ghost\u2019s voice in his ear again.</p>\n<p>They really need to put a stop to this. A line was obviously crossed this week, and neither of them seems to care.</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer a warm bed, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBetter find someone to keep it that way.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you know I don\u2019t got someone?\u201d Soap asks, because he cannot keep his fucking mouth shut.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a bit of silence on the line. Soap hears his heart rush in his ears. After a minute, Ghost statics in.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo you?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p>\n<p>They get patched to Laswell for a brief on the intel. The trucks won\u2019t be through town for another hour. Ghost says <em>copy, </em>and then communications kicks them to their own line again. Soap is pretty good at sitting still when needs be, but he finds himself shifting in the chair, adjusting the watch on his wrist, fidgeting as he thinks about <em>who</em> he\u2019d like keeping his bed warm.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou\u2019re edgy,\u201d </em>Ghost says out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>Soap freezes. He looks through his scope again, but doesn\u2019t see Ghost anywhere on the roof buildings.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou watching me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI can see you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap puffs. It\u2019s remarkable how a man as big and bulky as Ghost can seemingly disappear into any landscape.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood words for a first date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cKeep dreaming, sergeant.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap shifts in his chair again. The banter has a whole new layer to it now. A memory that feels heavy, weighing it all down. He adjusts the strap on his thigh to fiddle with his hands again. Unloads the magazine in his gun, just to pop it back in.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThere you go again. Got a snake up your ass?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, you\u2019d know it if there was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cGoing to share with the class then?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap rubs across his eyes. He sighs, chewing off his lip until he dares to answer back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIf it sets you right.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Now knowing that Ghost can see him, Soap slides down a little in the rickety chair. The wood squeaks. He digs his toe in the dirt, smudging it along the baseboard with his boot.</p>\n<p>\u201cTruth is, we\u2019ve been sleeping like sardines for two weeks, and I\u2019ve got a fuckin\u2019 rager.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah. He\u2019s hard again, and it\u2019s sticking to his leg, and the heat\u2019s making it no better. At least if they were stationed in Russia, his junk would be too frozen to bother.</p>\n<p>Dead silence. Soap has three-fourths of an existential crisis, before Ghost responds.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wank off after the raid on PI?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Soap groans. He hangs his head off the back of the chair and smothers a hand along his mouth. \u201cWhen the hell was I gonna\u2019 do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHmm. Showers?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, under a pop-up hose in the middle of the desert. Get real.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost chuckles. It\u2019s mostly a puff of breath, but it\u2019s still a real laugh.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou kids. Like a dog in heat.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, at least mine still works.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat it do.\u201d </em>They sit in silence for a moment. Soap pops his head back up, and watches a flock of crows fly through town. He\u2019s tempted to readjust himself in his pants, but doesn\u2019t. Ghost chooses violence again. <em>\u201cAlright, have a go at her then.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Soap jolts upright, fully awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou\u2019ve got fifty-five minutes uninterrupted. Sounds like an opportunity.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>His dick throbs. Soap drops a hand down, and rubs his heel against the seam, to keep himself grounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith you watchin\u2019 me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019ve always got your six, Johnny.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He sees a fork in the road. A path where he shuts this shit down right here, and a road where he follows it right to the cliff and jumps.</p>\n<p>Soap chews on the thumb of his glove. He pulls it off with his teeth, and the world feels cool against his bare palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to go dark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNo.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He offers no further explanation. Clearly, Ghost is going to listen.</p>\n<p>Soap rubs a palm down his crotch, and digs his heel into the dusty floor, pushing the chair back a little. He\u2019s in full gear, so he has to pull himself out through his cargo fly. His cock has gone from annoyingly hard to rock fucking solid, just by circumstance alone. Soap is a little shaky when he spits into his hand. His cock points straight up and throbs angrily. Ghost\u2019s scratchy tone sets his skin on fire.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOuch.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me \u2018bout it,\u201d Soap mutters. His face feels a little red \u2013 but <em>fuck it, </em>he\u2019s this far, let\u2019s do this. He starts slow just to see how long this is going to take, and by his body\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s not that long at all.</p>\n<p>He knows he\u2019s putting on a show. It\u2019s so fucked up, and it\u2019s so hot, it crosses every wire in his brain that loves to blow shit up, fuck hard, and disrespect authority. He wishes he could see Ghost, but it\u2019s almost better this way. Filthy, rushed, desperate.</p>\n<p>Soap strokes himself root to tip and keeps his breathing low. It goes quiet long enough for Soap to think the conversation is over, but Ghost continues to surprise him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou always get this hard for danger?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cJust when you\u2019re around,\u201d Soap blurts, then goes <em>fuuuck, </em>because he shoved his foot in his mouth again<em> \u2013</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMmm. This is boring. I thought you\u2019d like it rough.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s head spins. He tightens the grip on the shaft, slides down a little further, and huffs, \u201cNothing wrong with a bit of both.\u201d</p>\n<p>He spits on the head of his cock. Ghost goes <em>hm </em>through the coms. He sounds cool as a fuckin\u2019 cucumber.</p>\n<p>Soap wanks off thinking of Ghost. He imagines the crosshair of his gun trained on his cock. How he could blow it clean off, if he pulled the trigger. He groans lowly, and his dick drips over his knuckles. The slide of his hand gets wetter. God, he is so fucked up.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat\u2019s it, babe,\u201d </em>says Ghost. <em>\u201cYou\u2019re alright. Gotta\u2019 get it all out, yeah? Stop checkin\u2019 the street, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Soap sucks in a breath so loud, there\u2019s no way Ghost didn\u2019t hear him. His hand stutters, and his entire body pulses with arousal. He rocks his head back against the chair, arching slightly. His voice sounds like a bloody sin.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Simon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIs that little performance for me?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He runs his hand down, squeezes his balls, then strokes up again. He\u2019s getting close.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo long as you\u2019re watching.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m watching.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>His voice sounds deeper. Or maybe, it\u2019s Soap\u2019s arousal-soaked brain making shit up. He\u2019s getting off on it anyways, so what does he care.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s done a lot of dumb crap in his life, but this takes the cake. They\u2019re on a job, he\u2019s vulnerable, and he\u2019s on coms with his <em>superior officer. </em>The L.t that\u2019s watching him through the scope of his gun. The cold killer that\u2019s breathing heavily into his mic. His balls get tight. The head of his cock is shiny and red.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Soap hisses. \u201cSimon, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cClose?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cGo on, sweetheart. Be loud for me.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The pet name sets him off. His stomach twists in a knot, then releases. Soap moans weakly, his heel scraping against the floor as he cums all over the dusty plywood like an animal. He shudders violently, the long-needed orgasm ripping through him, and the choked sound he makes just becomes a bunch of mush to his ears.</p>\n<p>He sags. Soap wipes his hand off on his fatigues, and then covers his face with both arms to cool down.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy,\u201d </em>Ghost says. Soap physically twitches, and says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh god. Oh bloody Jesus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get any time to recover. The sound of a gunshot jerks him wide awake. Soap scrambles to shove himself back in his pants, spitting, \u201cGhost! What \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCompany\u2019s here. Calm down, I\u2019m on it. Let\u2019s see how good your recovery time is, Sergeant.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap zips up his pants, sides up to the window and aims his rifle at the truck zooming towards town. With a deep inhale, and a rush of adrenaline, he wills his hands to stop shaking. He shoots out both jeep windows, and the truck starts to veer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find it satisfactory, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in a daze all the way back to base. The job wraps up clean. Ghost stands around with his arms crossed like he didn\u2019t just watch his teammate wank through a broken window. That little nugget of information is conveniently left out of the report.</p>\n<p>They make eye-contact in the loading bay. It\u2019s what he should\u2019ve expected. Ghost might as well be a brick wall, his eyes half-lidded and disinterested, as if he\u2019s reading the morning paper.</p>\n<p>It <em>should </em>be different. It has to be. Nothing about that experience could be anywhere interpreted as normal or straight or <em>friendly</em>. He refuses to believe it was some bored whim of a madman.</p>\n<p>With all the packing, the commotion, the soldiers piled into the back of the air bus like dogs, there\u2019s no time to talk. So Soap shuts his mouth, and counts the bullets in his pistol mag one by one. Across from him, Ghost sits like a statue.</p>\n<p>Gaz elbows him in the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cTired, aye? I heard Captain\u2019s offering three-week leave this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The plane jolts with turbulence. He bumps a little into Gaz\u2019s shoulder, then pats him as an apology.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it. Feels like they\u2019ve been whoring our squad out to anyone worth their dime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gaz hums a low agreement. He folds his arms behind his head. \u201cYou should go home and see your girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost immediately snaps to attention.\u00a0 Soap clicks in the magazine of his gun, and holsters it.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh, you\u2019re probably right. It\u2019s been ages since we\u2019ve gone for a ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gaz nods thoughtfully, and Soap purposefully avoids the glare baring into the side of his face.</p>\n<p>They touchdown at HQ, and Ghost disappears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, really. That asshole is <em>gone.</em></p>\n<p>Soap gives it a full twenty-four hours until he really starts looking. And then he gets mad.</p>\n<p>Ghost is not in his room, not in the gym, not in the shooting range or Price\u2019s office or any of the loading bays. Soap actually starts to sweat. It can\u2019t end like this, or he will lose his sweet bleeding mind.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If that fucker went home already, I swear to all that is holy, I will fucking kill him \u2013</em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap pauses his step. He does a double take in the mess hall. Ghost isn\u2019t the only masked man that lurks around the base, but he <em>is </em>the only one that paints a big fat skull on it (also, Soap doesn\u2019t know any other mammal that enjoys beans on fucking toast).</p>\n<p>Soap slams his hands down on the table. Ghost doesn\u2019t startle, like he saw him coming. He glances at him neutrally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d demands Soap.</p>\n<p>The canteen gets very quiet. A spoon clatters into a bowl, and someone coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen talk,\u201d Ghost challenges. Ha, fine with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep playin\u2019 this hot n\u2019 cold game with you. There\u2019s team bonding, and then there\u2019s whatever the <em>fuck </em>that w-\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost slams his hands on the flimsy table and stands to his full height. The metal chair squeals. Soap can almost feel all the eyes divert to the walls out of fear. Ghost proceeds to scruff him by the back of the neck, and drag him out of the canteen. Soap chokes, tripping over a step, then pulling away \u2013 but Ghost simply regrips the back of his shirt to forcefully lead him down the hall.</p>\n<p>Soap struggles to keep up with his long stride, wriggling like a caught fish in his grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Where are you \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost stops abruptly. He rips the ID card out of his pocket, unlocks a door with said card, and then throws Soap inside.</p>\n<p>He stumbles, then freezes when he realizes whose barrack this is. No decorations, no belongings. Just four walls, a bed, and a small chest of clothing.</p>\n<p>Ghost slams him up against the wall.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou,\u201d </em>Ghost hisses, \u201care getting on my last nerve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap blanches, wholly insulted.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?! What the fuck have <em>I </em>done?! You\u2019re the one that humps me in a fuckin\u2019 closet, tells me to wank off on coms, then runs like a bloody coward \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost grabs the front of his shirt again, and Soap can feel the rage wafting off of him. It\u2019s never been directed in his face like this, never seen it this close before, but without the plastic mask, Soap can see his grey eyes clearly through the balaclava.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to <em>let it go, </em>MacTavish<em>. </em>Always pushing buttons, just to see if it explodes. <em>This </em>is not a negotiable conversation. Go back to your barrack and forget this ever happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re into me,\u201d Soap spits, like it\u2019s an insult.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou drive me fucking crazy!\u201d Ghost barks. \u201cOf course I bloody am!\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap pauses. His eyes go big, and they both stare at each other for a long, breathless silence. Then, Soap attacks.</p>\n<p>He tries to wretch out of Ghost\u2019s grip, grappling for his upper arms and sweeping out his right ankle. He\u2019s only halfway successful, in which Ghost counters him through his sheer weight. Soap wriggles and fights and spits, until Ghost bodies him back against the wall, slips out a knife, and holds it to his throat. Insurance.</p>\n<p>\u201cStand. Down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap pants against the blade.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s eyes drop down, and up. He\u2019s breathing hard too. The knife keeps him pinned, his grip steady as a rock.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2026<em>we\u2026</em>cannot happen. Not for men like us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s heart drops. He swallows, then croaks, \u201cWhy not? And if you give me some long spiel about <em>worthiness, </em>I\u2019m going to barf all over you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s eyes soften. Not by much, but enough for his furious stare to drop over Soap\u2019s throat. He shifts the angle of the knife, running it over his larynx, then teasing the vein.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You know what I\u2019ve done.\u201d The tip of the knife turns by his ear. Ghost sighs. \u201cI turned off this part of my brain a long time ago. The part that\u2026wants. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea to turn it back on again. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap turns towards the blade. He notes how Ghost keeps the pressure soft, as not to really hurt him. It scrapes his skin, and gains back Ghost\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to protect me? Cute, but unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Ghost says. \u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s eyes widen. He sets his head back against the wall and whispers, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost starts to pull away, \u201cLet it go \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I won\u2019t! Simon, I\u2019m fucking obsessed with you, every sick, twisted part of you \u2013 why can\u2019t we \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>He slams the knife into the wall, right by his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re an <em>addiction!\u201d </em>Ghost shouts, stopping him in his tracks. \u201cAnd I <em>CANNOT </em>have you, because I will <em>NEVER </em>let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fight drains out of him. Soap stands there, not really breathing, not really doing anything. Ghost turns around and rubs a hand over his face, and suddenly, Soap is reminded of poison apples.</p>\n<p>Just one bite, to prove you can hold back. To <em>taste, </em>and let go.</p>\n<p>All the teasing, the flirting, the random, fleeting touches, only to run away in the end. It all makes sense; Ghost has been torturing himself, just to know he can.</p>\n<p>Soap wets his bottom lip. Ghost\u2019s broad back looks so distant, and untouchable. Soap softly grazes his finger along the knife embedded by his ear, and asks, \u201cBut one vice is okay, right?\u201d Ghost turns around. His eyes look tired, full of dark circles, like he hasn\u2019t slept. He gazes down at him, and Soap\u2019s heart wrings into pieces. \u201cNot all addictions are a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost steps forwards. He slides his bare hand along Soap\u2019s neck, and the skin-to-skin contact gives him fucking butterflies.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen what you can do.\u201d He thumbs along his stubbled cheek, and his voice comes out soft. \u201cYou are definitely a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap leans up on his toes, a little closer to his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m really, really good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost whispers painfully, like it\u2019s wretched out of his soul. <em>\u201cJohnny\u2026\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Soap leans up to kiss him through the mask. The barrier keeps him from feeling skin, but he can still taste heat, desire, and intent. He can feel the shape of his lips like kissing through a veil, and the thrill of it jolts down his spine. Ghost squeezes his neck and kisses back, and Soap grips into his biceps to keep him from leaving.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, please,\u201d Soap begs, pushing his tongue into the fabric \u2013 and to his utter delight, Ghost leans back just enough to yank the balaclava to his nose. Finally, he kisses him with a mouth full of longing.</p>\n<p>He tastes like a gunshot, fire and powder, guttural need and fury. Their lips move and curl and bite, burning from the scrape of their chins, all spitfire in their fight to control. Soap reels because <em>Ghost</em> <em>wants him back.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>He cries a relieved noise. Ghost grabs under his thigh to hoist him up the wall, and their sounds fill up the empty barrack with wet kisses and breathy gasps. Ghost holds his weight easily (big fucking bastard), so Soap digs his blunt nails along the skin of his neck and holds his jaw still so he can map out his mouth with his tongue.</p>\n<p>His lips are <em>soft. </em>Soap likes the stubble rubbing against his own. He can feel a sharp line through his lip and past his nose, a soft little scar he can press his tongue into. The physicality fucks him up so bad; makes him so dizzy that his brain takes an extra second to recognize the metal ball in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d Soap pulls back. Ghost\u2019s eyes peel open halfway. Drowsy, and dilated. <em>\u201cWhat. </em>Is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost blinks at him once. Then, he peels open his mouth, and reveals the silver piercing on his tongue. He has notably sharp canines, and the ball rattles between them as he clicks it around. Soap loses his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit! That\u2019s sexy as fuck. How did you get that past physical?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTook it out,\u201d Ghost answers easily. He seeks out Soap\u2019s lips again, and Soap busies himself with the shiny new toy, moaning in surprise when Ghost not only takes charge, but clicks the piercing against his teeth and bites him. Soap feels feral. He\u2019s drunk on all the sticky desire, thick in his veins like honey.</p>\n<p>They kiss over and over, deep and messy, spit running down his chin, sucking in air through his nose \u2013 all that nasty shit. Ghost still smells like gunmetal and it <em>still </em>turns him on to high-hell. That musky, manly smell; it churns up his gut, makes him want to bite, fuck and kill.</p>\n<p>Soap breaks the cycle to gnaw on his cheek; licking along the rolled-up line of the balaclava to test how far he can push before Ghost stops him.</p>\n<p>More buttons to push, more explosions to see.</p>\n<p>His weight is shifted into one arm, and then the back of his head is ripped back by the hair. Soap moans, looking up through wet, clumpy eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Ghost \u2013 lemme suck you off. I won\u2019t ask nothin\u2019 else for Christmas, promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hums. His mouth sucks under Soaps ear \u2013 <em>fuck \u2013 </em>and then bites down beneath it with his inhumanly sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about your <em>girl?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUhh.\u201d Soap has to blink away some of the haze to sort that one out. Ghost drops him to a foot so he can push up his shirt and grope along his stomach, bigass hands squeezing his waist, then cupping his behind. Soap shivers, then recalls his conversation with Gaz on the plane. He laughs. \u201c<em>Ohhh. </em>My bike!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost pauses.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ride a motorbike?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, I keep her in a garage near Glasgow. I should take you for a ride sometime, prettiest babe you\u2019ll ever see.\u201d Soap hooks an ankle around his calf and tugs, wobbling Ghost off balance, causing him to slap his hand against the wall to steady himself. Soap grins. \u201cBesides you, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost glares at him. He rips the knife out of the wall and holsters it.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your shirt off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap snickers to himself. He yanks off his tee by the back of the neck, just as Ghost unclips his chest holster and hangs it. He shoves Soap towards the bed, but Soap gets a grip on his utility belt and tugs so he\u2019ll follow too.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod I need this,\u201d Soap rasps. \u201cBeen dreaming of your cock in my mouth for ages.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost nudges him by the shoulder, and Soap eagerly drops to his knees. He immediately dives for his belt, but Ghost stops him with a firm grip on his chin. He forces his eyes up, and <em>lord </em>he just looks so big from down here.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe start this, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d Ghost squeezes tight, forcing Soap higher on his knees, like he\u2019s at attention. He grabs onto Ghost\u2019s thigh-straps for balance. \u201cI\u2019ll kill any poor sod that touches you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap grins. \u201cOh fuck yeah. You want me to be yours? I can be yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Desire flares in Ghost\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s intense to be at the center of his attention. Suddenly, he thumbs along Soap\u2019s jaw, and pries his mouth open. Ghost leans down a little, and Soap arches for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost clicks his piercing against his teeth, and Soap\u2019s stomach coils when he realizes what\u2019s about to happen. Slowly, with purpose, Ghost holds his face still and spits right on his tongue, and Soap physically feel his cock spring to life.</p>\n<p>Soap rolls the spit around in his mouth, proudly showing off how wet and ready he is. Ghost smears the excess spit around his lips with this thumb, and hums proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap curses a low <em>fuuck </em>under his breath. He moves for his belt again, and this time Ghost lets him. He pops off the utility belt \u2013 fuck that thing \u2013 he tosses it, then he works down his fly and palms up his bulge through the fabric. It\u2019s thick and warm, and when Soap yanks down his trousers, his throat swallows dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo undies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Ghost shrugs. Soap is going to cum in his pants.</p>\n<p>He palms up his bare cock, amazed at the sheer girth of it. He\u2019s heavy in his hand, not even fully hard and already a mouth full. He\u2019s pink and veiny and Soap dives right for his sack, licking up the seam and gathering spit in his mouth so he can slobber up the underside and get him hard. Ghost grunts a noise, and Soap goes all tingly with excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck yeah babe,\u201d Soap rattles. \u201cKnew you were packin\u2019 heat. You gonna\u2019 let me sit on it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch your fuckin\u2019 mouth,\u201d Ghost growls.</p>\n<p>Soap pulls the head into his mouth, sucks wetly, then pops back to purr, \u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost curses, and Soap has to try really hard not to smile. \u201cFaster,\u201d Ghost tells him, so Soap is good, and begins to bob his head. He stretches around his mouth, doesn\u2019t quite make him gag (he\u2019s too practiced for that), but the size makes his chest seize up, like he\u2019s on the edge of choking. The adrenaline is maddening, and it really turns him on. His cock doesn\u2019t taste like nothin\u2019 but how it should, and it\u2019s <em>good. </em>Soap is drooling all over himself, sucking to the tip, swirling his tongue through the slit, sucking out all the bitter flavor. He moans when Ghost grabs him by the scruff and shoves him all the way down to the happy-trail at his navel.</p>\n<p>He chokes a little. Ghost has a mean grip. His strong fingers thread deep into his mohawk as his knuckles rub into the shaved part of his hair. Soap could probably twist out of it if he wanted to, but why would he do that? He has everything he wants \u2013 massive thighs under his greedy fingers, the arousing sound of Ghost\u2019s heavy breathing, a grip on his hair and a cock pulsing in his mouth. True serenity in a whore\u2019s church.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap looks up through his lashes, and satisfaction curls in his stomach when he sees that Ghost is watching him hungrily.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ghost whispers. \u201cYou look good, baby. Half the S.A.S would gag to fuck this face, you know that?\u201d He tightens his grip, lowers his voice. \u201cCan you stay like this? Skewered on a cock all night, if I ordered you to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap moans enthusiastically around him. Drool is dripping off his chin. He feels like a fucking dog, and he might just start pawing at his crotch should this go on any longer. The metal zipper in his jeans is cutting into some very sensitive bits. Everything feels electric, tense, and possessive.</p>\n<p>Ghost presses a palm to his forehead, and sweeps the short hair out of his eyes. Soap\u2019s eyelashes flutter. Then, Ghost pinches his nose shut, and Soap really starts to choke. He gags, squirms, panics, but doesn\u2019t move. Ghost waits and watches, and only once Soap\u2019s eyelashes droop, does he let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Ghost coos. \u201cFucking beautiful. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Soap coughs, his throat raw. Ghost\u2019s fat cock slaps up to his shirt, angry and red. Soap presses his cheek up against Ghost\u2019s thigh and breathes. \u201cAlmost saw the lord for a minute there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hauls him up, pushes him onto the bed, and crawls over him. Later, Soap would rationalize that the manhandling didn\u2019t turn him on as bad as it did.</p>\n<p>The mattress bounces and creeks. It cuts through the thick tension, before it all pools back in, filling this empty barrack like a bowl once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking <em>good,</em>\u201d Ghost snarls. \u201cNo complaints? Just gonna\u2019 let me choke you till you cark it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap arches off the bed with a groan. Ghost is already digging into his pants, sucking into his throat, and licking the spit off his chin. The holy trinity of sex.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA good way to go,\u201d Soap pants. Desperate and fuzzy, he manipulates the shirt off of Ghost, forcefully yanking the tight fabric off his beefy arms so he can worship his chest. He\u2019s covered in scars; both thick keloids and faded marks long healed. His ink sleeve extends to his bicep, and a few tattoos roll over his shoulder, and down his back. \u201cGod you are so hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost kisses him. For a moment, Soap thinks his breath might\u2019ve hitched. The balaclava is still rolled up to his nose, and Soap wants so badly to rip that stupid thing off, but it\u2019s a boundary Ghost hasn\u2019t removed yet, so he won\u2019t touch it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet naked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap doesn\u2019t have to be told twice. He wriggles off his jeans and chucks his socks, just as Ghost kneels off the bed to dig for lube and condoms. Soap\u2019s gut twists clockwise with the realization that this actually happening.</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s looming figure is still intimidating. Black mask, no shirt, heavy cock half-tucked back in his cargos, arms big and veiny, his stomach strong with a thin layer of fat. Soap flops back on his bed and spreads his knees, and when Ghost looks back over, his eyes flash with interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna\u2019 lube me up, babe?\u201d He hooks a hand under his thigh as Ghost kneels back on the bed. \u201cHave a feel. You\u2019ll never go back to a cunt, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost\u2019s eyes narrow. He leans over him and kisses at his mouth, and Soap eagerly returns it, hand fliting to the crook of his neck. Ghost is a surprisingly good kisser, and even more surprising, is that he likes to do it so much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNever have, never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap raises his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Ghost mutters. A kiss to his jaw, then his neck, then the peak of his collarbones. It\u2019s startlingly intimate, and makes his chest flutter. \u201cThought that part of me was dead. You\u2019re the first to get me hard in years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap squirms, flattered and somewhat proud. He wants to write his name all over him. That tongue ring pets along his nipple, and he gasps sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, fuck. Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost scrapes his teeth down his sternum. He starts to twitch when he licks down his stomach, and bites at his abs. He has a few scars there. Not nearly as many as Ghost, but he still tongues down them anyways, like they matter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Because of your hands. When you take apart your rifle and put it back together.\u201d He licks into his bellybutton, and the scruff on his chin rubs him funny. \u201cYour eyes light up when you blow C-4. You always let the youngins take the best sleeping bag. It\u2019s bloody <em>obscene </em>when you stab someone in the back, smiling while they bleed.\u201d Finally, Ghost looks up at him, and Soap feels like he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cAbout fuckin\u2019 died in that closet, Johnny. You squirming all nervous and sweet in my lap \u2013 fuckin\u2019 <em>really </em>mate, had me so hard I never thought I\u2019d walk right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Soap whispers. Speechless.</p>\n<p>He rubs the nose of the balaclava against his cock, and it jerks from the tease. Something wet and sticky prods between his leg, and Soap naturally arches for him. Ghost licks the tip of his cock.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce I got you to moan in my ear, I thought I\u2019d be satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost circles his hole with cold lube. Soap pushes down on the finger that slides into him, encouraging a second. His fingers are thick and long, it makes his head spin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHah, yeah? Were you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>He fucks him with his fingers for a short while, in and out to get used to the feeling \u2013 not like Soap needs much training on this, he\u2019s practically drooling for it, hands running up and down Ghost\u2019s chest, squeezing his arms, the side of his neck, anything to get him to move faster.</p>\n<p>Soap groans, \u201cFuuck I want you. Haven\u2019t been fucked in ages \u2013 y\u2019know, a few months back, I was gonna\u2019 bang that chav you scared off in the pub.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ghost growls. They\u2019re both a bit too big for the bed \u2013 too much muscle, too many limbs. The cheap mattress creaks under their weight. Ghost steps a foot off the bed, drags Soap to the edge by his thighs, and pushes him up so he can line up along his hole. \u201cBite the pillow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap doesn\u2019t, then has his regrets because holy <em>fuck. </em>It didn\u2019t feel so bad in his mouth, but Ghost\u2019s cock splits his ass right up the middle, and it burns like hell the same way a stim-shot does, overwhelmingly hot, before stinging ecstasy. Soap tips his head back and moans, and Ghost smothers a hand over his mouth, but they\u2019re probably too late for that anyways. The whole base is gonna\u2019 hear \u2018em, decorum be damned.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Ghost growls. He hangs his head, and Soap can see a bead of sweat drip down his neck. The veins in his arms are bulging, and he can see the way his stomach muscles flex with need. He\u2019s <em>in him. </em>Fucking inside him, his very own monster. \u201cFuck, Johnny, you\u2019re good, you\u2019re really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d Soap wipes his eyes. <em>\u201cC\u2019mon L.t.</em> My cock\u2019s gonna\u2019 fall off.<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Ghost sneers, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that \u2014 not like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thrusts out, then in, lingering in a slow pace until they both adjust. Soap slaps the side of his shoulder, and Ghost finally picks up the pace, and Soap sighs in relief.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSimon.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright? You\u2019re fuckin\u2019 tight, Soap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta\u2019 fuck me \u2018till I\u2019m loose, don\u2019t you know the rules?\u201d Soap laughs hoarsely when Ghost growls, pushing his thighs up and slamming all the way in. Holy horse cock, that\u2019s a lot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how flexible you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost stops holding back, and it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to Soap in his <em>life. </em>Finally, someone that can throw him around, rough him up a bit, fuck him until it hurts. The rhythm is equally brutal and perfect, just like a good old soldier, loyal and true. Soap is sweating, too afraid to touch his own erection, more focused on the beating his ass is taking. Ghost finds his prostate and hones in on it, thank fuck, not that hard to tell once he\u2019s got it, because Soap arches straight off the bed and moans through his clenched teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re loud, sweetheart,\u201d Ghost mutters.</p>\n<p>That damn pet name again. It\u2019s jet fuel in his veins.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cUnf, </em>fuck, o-only when the going\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost sticks his knee back on the bed, forces Soap\u2019s legs over his shoulders, and makes Soap bite into his fist to sting out the pleasure. Their dogtags clink together, both their bellies pressed close like this. The position change makes him clench down, and Soap knows how good that feels, because Ghost physically shudders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHold onto me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap is glad he listens, because Ghost thrusts hard and fast. Hips slamming into his own, toes curling, nails clawing into the back of his mask. Soap pulls on it, begging <em>Simon please \u2013 </em>and in one quick, impulsive movement, Ghost rolls his weight to one arm, so he can rip off the mask, and kiss him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a complete shock. Soap\u2019s hands fly to his face, mapping out all that new, raw skin. His hair is nearly white, just like the stubble on his jaw. His nose is long, his eyebrows are thick, and scars run across his face in a uniform direction, like he was swiped with a knife over and over. Soap takes one look at him, and falls right in love.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah, </em>Simon, babe \u2013 you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 beautiful,\u201d Soap tells him. It feels reverent to watch Simon\u2019s face twist in amusement, his cold eyes squinting, and his pretty mouth twitching. He plunges his tongue past his parted lips and Soap fully accepts it, playing with that tongue ring while his cock leaks happily.</p>\n<p>Ghost says <em>cum when I tell you to, </em>so Soap holds on best he can. He\u2019s getting there, known by the tightness in his balls and a growing heat in his core. Untouched? Yeah right, but more likely than you\u2019d think. Ghost\u2019s firm stomach is rubbing up on him, and it\u2019s slowly setting him on fire.</p>\n<p>The headboard slams against the wall. Oops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He builds and builds and builds. He\u2019s white knuckled, clenching his teeth, blinking away tears. He can only focus on holding on, staving off the inevitable through willpower, and the desire to please.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ghost pities him. \u201cSoap \u2014 fuck, Johnny, <em>now.\u201d </em>And Soap\u2019s body pulls the pin. His cock bounces, throbs \u2013 Soap worms a hand down to work his way through it, to extend the orgasm until he\u2019s shaking. He makes a fuckin\u2019 mess and doesn\u2019t give a steaming shit about it. His legs slip to the crook of Ghost\u2019s big arms, and this time he gets to watch Ghost\u2019s face as he murmurs, \u201cThat\u2019s it, let it out \u2013 you\u2019re lovely, <em>fuck, </em>look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap arches, shivers violently, then sags. Ghost slows for him out of courtesy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap takes his soiled hand, and pushes it to his lips. Shockingly, Ghost parts his mouth and licks between his fingers. Soap snaps his head back against the mattress and groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cOfficially K.I.A.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye. Can\u2019t feel ma toes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost laughs a little. Soap fiddles with the ring on his tongue, petting over the piercing one more time before pulling away, and wiping his hand on the sheets. Ghost tries to pull out, but Soap goes <em>\u201cNo, </em>no no. You next, or I ain\u2019t movin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time in his life, Ghost almost looks embarrassed. He glances away, his chest heaving, his cheeks slightly pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno if I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>The world comes a little more into clarity, now that he\u2019s going soft. He hooks an ankle behind his fat ass, nudges him further up the bed, and rolls halfway on his side. Ghost flinches, shifting his cock back in, and Soap hums happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019 fine. Take all night, won\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost rolls his eyes, and eventually resumes fucking him. The overstimulation is\u2026a lot, but it\u2019s not torture, and Soap likes the feeling of a body so heavy on top of him. He edges him on, encourages him for a ton of sloppy kisses, and after a while, he feels Ghost start to relax.</p>\n<p>Soap wants to squeeze his eyes shut, but he keeps them open to watch Ghost\u2019s face go slack with pleasure. It\u2019s real gorgeous, that mug he hides away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on darling, tell me how I feel. Best arse you\u2019ve had, no doubt about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost huffs through his nose, thrusting over, and over.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a vice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap grins. He reaches over to pats his hip, saying, \u201cTake the condom off, I\u2019ll feel even better.\u201d Ghost raises his eyebrows \u2013 pretty fucker that he is. Soap clarifies, \u201cWe test like every damn month, we\u2019re clean \u2013 take it off n\u2019 fill me up, ya damn prude.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does it. He watches his pupils physically narrow, like a predator sighting prey. He pulls off, tosses the condom, re-slicks with lube, and fucking <em>groans </em>when he pushes back into his abused hole. Even spent, the sound makes Soap rekindle with arousal.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Ghost curses.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Soap echoes. \u201cThere we are. I wanna\u2019 see the <em>Ghost.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>His hips will be bruised tomorrow. Thank God for shore leave, because he\u2019ll be hobbling off one leg for a week. A worthy sacrifice, for the sounds Ghost is making. Big bad hero, puffing in his ear. Soap is on top of the world (or under it, depending on how you view it).</p>\n<p>He\u2019s silent when he finally stops, shudders, and hangs his head, curling into Soap\u2019s open arms. Soap goes <em>yeah yeah yeah \u2013 </em>and Ghost spills inside him, a big fat mess. He feels oddly proud. Pretty powerful stuff. Soap combs through his hair while Ghost hides from him, face pressed into his shoulder while he catches his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d Soap coos. \u201cThat\u2019s it \u2013 must\u2019ve been a good one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Ghost mutters. He kisses under his ear, too damn sweet. They both cringe when he pulls out \u2013 both the overstimulation, and the realization that Soap could probably go again. He suddenly understands the addiction. This will never be enough. He\u2019ll spend years chasing <em>more, </em>never satisfied until he can slice Ghost open and crawl inside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ghost wipes them down with a hand towel he summons out of thin air, then arranges himself by the wall, so Soap has little choice other than to crawl half on top of him, or fall off the bed. He\u2019s a little surprised that Ghost hasn\u2019t kicked him out yet, but maybe he\u2019s still rebooting. Like always, Soap tests his luck.</p>\n<p>The air feels awkward. They\u2019ve exposed themselves so deeply, emotionally, physically \u2013 Ghost breathes beneath him, steady and firm, warm skin under his ear, and Soap sighs, finally throwing an arm back over him and hooking a leg over his hip. Ghost stays stiff at first, but the post-orgasm haze doesn\u2019t keep him tense for long. Soap runs his fingers along his tattoo sleeve, up his forearm, then his elbow. He\u2019s a man of flesh and blood, no aberration here.</p>\n<p>Soap prepares to break the tension, but it turns out he doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you make a pool table laugh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap tips his head, genuinely stunned. Ghost\u2019s expression is as flat as a pancake.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTickle it\u2019s balls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap gives him a wide-eyed look that translates to <em>are you fucking serious right now, </em>but the way Ghost stares back at him, Soap already knows the answer is yes. Something about that is so damn endearing, it cuts right into his heart.</p>\n<p>So, he fits his mouth onto Ghost\u2019s round bicep, and chomps into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHilarious. Don\u2019t tell me you were brewing that one the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost doesn\u2019t even acknowledge the bite.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few days, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap licks over the little red mark on his arm. It\u2019s near a scar there \u2013 an old gunshot wound. He rolls his cheek onto it, so he can look him in the eye again. Soap is genuinely happy, and that\u2019s the worst part about this.</p>\n<p>\u201cSimon\u2026what are we doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Ghost sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreaking at least three different codes of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, God save our squeaky reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost nudges his head. Soap\u2019s stomach flips in a circle when he sees that he\u2019s trying to kiss him. Soap welcomes his parted lips, tipping his head to bump their noses out of the way. They both smell, feel, and taste like sex, and it\u2019s going to be a rude awakening when they have to gear up and go back out to the base.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve got problems, but HQ isn\u2019t the place to work them out. Not surrounded by rules and barracks and nosy spec ops and ugly concrete walls.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you got plans for leave?\u201d Soap asks.</p>\n<p>Ghosts seems thrown by the question. Soap is still trying to memorize his face as much as he can, before it disappears again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pause. \u201cWas going to train fresh transfers with Roach, but I didn\u2019t confirm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back home with me. It\u2019s no castle, but the bed\u2019s a sure upgrade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost doesn\u2019t look too excited about the idea (not that he\u2019s ever looked excited about anything), but Soap tries not to get disheartened when he takes longer to answer. Ghost\u2019s hand draws up to thumb the scar over his eye. Shockingly tender. Soap yearns for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a trap,\u201d Soap adds. \u201cYou want to stay, then stay. I\u2019ll still fuckin\u2019 want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost finally cracks. A hand falls to the top of his head, and Soap realizes they\u2019ll be alright.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap beams, suddenly rejuvenated. Ghost rolls his eyes and begins to pat around for his mask again, and Soap begs him <em>no no no please, five more minutes \u2013</em></p>\n<p>A light knock on the wall makes his teeth snap shut. His jaw physically clicks, and some of the chill starts to crawl back over him, a bitter reminder of reality.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. You share the wall with Gaz, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me. I\u2019ll check if Ryanair has any redeyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost looks like he might be laughing behind that stony expression of his. Soap can hear humor in his voice, \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap digs under the bed for his discarded pants, patting around for the phone in his pocket. Ghost slips his hand down his spine, and buries two of his fingers where his hole is still soft and pliant, so the flight waits a little longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Price takes one look at them, puffs out of his mouth, and waves them off like smoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s stepped foot in this apartment, Soap has to run through his entire keyring to remember which key it is.</p>\n<p>Ghost offers to kick it down, genuinely serious, to the point where Soap stammers, \u201cI got it, I got it! Jesus H fuck\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He flicks the lights on, dumps his keys on the peg, chucks his duffle on the couch, and pulls the gun off his belt, sliding it on the counter. Ghost does not, instead following at his heel, looking skeptically around the flat. It\u2019s not <em>big, </em>but it serves its purpose as a crash pad, so it's good enough.</p>\n<p>He can already tell Ghost is measuring out the place; scanning windows, exits, doors. It\u2019s tactical training, so Soap doesn\u2019t take it personal. The d\u00e9cor is pretty standard, most of it came with the place, but a few things are his, like the framed photos of the motorcycle babes on the walls, and the beer sculpture he made in the six months he bothered with university.</p>\n<p>Ghost drags his hand along a picture frame, and lifts his finger, showing off the lack of dust with a skeptical expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cI pay my sister to keep the place up,\u201d Soap explains, rummaging around the kitchen. Nothing in the fridge, or the cabinets \u2013 shit, it\u2019s really been a while. \u201cYes, that is a hidden camera, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost stops poking at the fake potted plant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou have a sister?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, aye, don\u2019t gotta\u2019 lecture me on liability. But she\u2019s a cop, daft cunt can take care of herself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Soap turns around, and Ghost is there. At least he doesn\u2019t jump this time, when Ghost backs him up against the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cSoap. Why are we here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hasn\u2019t removed the paper face mask, the sunglasses, or the hat, so Soap can\u2019t get a read on him. He sniffs, and crosses his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends. Why\u2019d you say <em>yes?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap smirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s your answer. C\u2019mon, dump your bag \u2013 there\u2019s a caf\u00e9 down half a block, you can finally get your tea.\u201d He ducks out from under Ghost\u2019s arm, pointing about the flat. \u201cBedroom, bathroom, closet \u2013 pretty fundamental.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoap\u2026\u201d Ghost trails.</p>\n<p>He swallows, shrugging on a thicker jacket. It\u2019s easier to avoid eye contact with the sunglasses, although, Soap can still feel his stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now. Let\u2019s just\u2026food, yeah? I need to remember how to be human for a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost pockets his hands, and shifts to wait by the door. Soap takes that as his answer, so he grabs his keys again. Ghost follows.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter be good tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both know they\u2019re running from the inevitable. But no matter how many skeletons you bury, or how many problems you hide in the sand, they always come back to haunt you.</p>\n<p>Soap doesn\u2019t live a complicated life because he <em>can\u2019t. </em>Strings get caught in the barbed wire. Hearts get broken.</p>\n<p>But for some unknown reason, he wants this more than he\u2019s wanted anything else before.</p>\n<p>As they sit in a dinky caf\u00e9 of his hometown, two killers with eyes on the door, guns under their belts, playing <em>pedestrian </em>and yet, only somewhat succeeding \u2013 Soap knows that this is something he wants <em>only with Ghost. </em></p>\n<p>The time is so early, the city isn\u2019t even awake yet. Ghost frowns into his tea, and Soap bites off his scone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ghost grunts, looking particularly puzzled. Soap snorts, chewing. \u201cGuess it ain\u2019t all primitive up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck off.\u201d Soap extends his leg under the table, and tenses when he feels Ghost\u2019s boot up against his own. Seriously, this guy was up his <em>ass </em>(still feeling that, actually), and yet his stomach is in knots over a conversation. He glances around the empty caf\u00e9, and lowers his voice anyways. \u201cGhost?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap corrects himself. \u201cSimon.\u201d He looks out the window, sees the sun rising, and suddenly feels tired. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be just about sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost doesn\u2019t physically tense, but he can still feel it through his eyes. They\u2019re so expressive \u2013 big and round, capable of looking sweet, like a puppy, or the absolute stuff of nightmares. Pure range, this guy.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d He pops off the baseball cap and runs a hand through his silvery hair. It\u2019s thick, and damp. Soap misses the feeling of it already. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mad about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRelationships are messy, Soap, you know this. The army\u2019s one thing, but what we do\u2026\u201d Ghost pops the cap back on. The bill shadows his eyes. \u201cYou get compromised, you die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already compromised.\u201d Soap flings out his arms, as if to say <em>what are you going to do about it? Write me up? Call the captain? </em>\u201cIf someone kills you, I\u2019ll gut \u2018em. Someone gets me, I know you\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do worse,\u201d Ghost growls. Soap\u2019s stomach does a little cartwheel. \u201cNot even God could save them from me.\u201d Soap smiles at him, carefully offering his hand under the booth, where the barista half-asleep at the bar won\u2019t see.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s hot.\u201d Soap laughs, mostly to himself. \u201cYou know I\u2019m head over tits for you, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ghost stares.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he grabs Soap by the wrist, instead of his open hand. He yanks hard, nearly pulling his damn arm out of the socket, and Soap scrambles after in dull shock.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHey! </em>Fucking hell, what \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about your \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0They walk the half-block back to his flat. It\u2019s actually more of a sprint, that is, until Soap gets the door open, and Ghost pushes him up against the wall. He yanks down his face mask and kisses him fiercely \u2013 and Soap, having had enough of the shoving around, decides to push until it\u2019s Ghost pinned to the door, a hand up his shirt, and at his neck.</p>\n<p>He flicks off the baseball cap, and it falls at their feet. Ghost consumes him, lips moving, pressing, tongue swiping into his mouth, that accursed metal ball clicking against his teeth. Soap moans, and Ghost swallows it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make me insane,\u201d Ghost snarls. Soap braces his hand against the wall, and gasps through his nose when Ghost bites down on a bruise that isn\u2019t even healed yet. It\u2019s right above his collar, for the world to see. \u201cGonna\u2019 carve my name all over you. Cut you up with my knife, make you bleed all pretty.\u201d He hears Ghost take a labored breath, like he\u2019s fighting for control. \u201cI\u2019ll gag you on the end of my pistol, shove it down your fucking throat \u2013 I\u2019d bloody <em>do it, </em>Johnny. I\u2019d pull the trigger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap feels the mental stability of the personages in this room dropping by the second. Mostly because, the idea alone is enough to get him throbbing hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d he rasps, confident, despite the shake in his voice. \u201cUnless I ask you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost drops to his knees, and Soap nearly cries.</p>\n<p>Later, when he\u2019s squirming and begging for it, he shoves Ghost on the couch, shucks his pants and digs around for the lube in his discarded duffel bag. Ghost\u2019s mouth is all wet with spit, and he tastes like cock and tea, and Soap licks it right out of him, all while he sits down and rides. This time, Ghost threads their fingers together, and he supports his weight while Soap uses his thighs to sit up and bounce. They never stop kissing. Not for a second \u2013 even when it devolves to grunts and moans, panting into each other\u2019s open mouths and drooling like dogs, they rub each other raw. Down to the bone.</p>\n<p>Soap comes so hard the world goes black and white. He stays conscious long enough to feel Ghost seize up under him, and then, finally, it\u2019s just darkness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Soap wakes up in his bed.</p>\n<p>Alone, at first, and it\u2019s fuck-knows-what time, so he rolls over and goes back to sleep. He awakes a second time to a dip in the mattress. An arm throws over him, chokes around his neck, and weighs him down as a body slides behind him. His subconscious knows it\u2019s Simon, so he allows himself to doze in and out, until he recognizes the smell of his own shampoo.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou showered?\u201d He yawns.</p>\n<p>Ghost noses into the back of his neck. Surprisingly cuddly, he fits Soap against every surface of his body, and sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Did the shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap peeks open an eye, and sees light filtering through the curtain of his window.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, I slept that long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot a few hours.\u201d It\u2019s not a satisfying answer, but Soap knows the drill. Strange city, strange bed \u2013 it\u2019ll take a few days to teach his brain that this place is safe. Soap brings up a hand to pet up his arm, feeling the tendons all the way to his wide wrist. He squeezes, and Ghost relaxes his hand so he can hold it. They\u2019re fuckin two-ply soft and Soap doesn\u2019t give half a damn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re restless.\u201d Soap yawns again, and stretches like a cat. He rolls his head halfway, bonking his temple against Ghost\u2019s solid cranium. \u201cA jog might do us good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap bats him away, going, <em>roll over, lemme\u2019 piss, </em>but Ghost keeps him pinned, kissing the side of his mouth, morning breath and all. Soap punches him in the shoulder until he budges, but still watches him protectively from the bed.</p>\n<p>He spits in the sink, wipes his mouth and waddles towards the kitchen (<em>not </em>limping). He pulls open cabinets as Ghost follows behind him. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see the damage. Bread, rice, beans \u2013 <em>six </em>boxes of tea, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like variety,\u201d Ghost states.</p>\n<p>Soap grumbles to himself. At least Ghost got the coffee he likes. He\u2019s halfway into pouring water in the pot, when the lock on his front door begins to jiggle.</p>\n<p>The room goes very cold, very quickly.</p>\n<p>They both move in perfect sync. Ghost pulls the pistol off his belt, while Soap grabs his from the counter, and aims as the door swings open.</p>\n<p>The person in the doorway freezes. She drops her bags, and hovers a hand by her side. She\u2019s got a weapon.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Ghost calls.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Soap blurts. \u201cJess?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jessica blinks in raw shock. Then she sags, pushing her shoulder up against the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking <em>hell </em>John! Would it kill you to send ya living flesh a little warning? Bastard cunt, almost fucking shat myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost straightens, hesitating to lower his gun, until Soap waves him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry. Ghost, this is my sister, Jess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jessica kicks her bags into the flat and slams the door shut. She stares between them, and Soap internally groans, because he can already see her putting the pieces together. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist; Soap is walking around in boxers, and without the mask, Ghost looks like a top match off grindr.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fuckin\u2019 dog,\u201d Jessica points, stalking towards Soap. \u201c<em>I\u2019ll gie ye a skelpit lug, </em>too busy to write home, running around with your little spec-ops buddies, but not too busy to shack up with some \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s from work!\u201d Soap says quickly, lifting his hands in defense, so she won\u2019t hit him. \u201cWe\u2019re on leave! <em>Keep the heid \u2013 </em>just flew in yesterday, I fuckin\u2019 swear.<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jessica pauses.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d She turns to Ghost and nods, \u201cNice ta meet ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost looks between them both. He has the same expression as when they were in Mexico, when Alejandro would mouth off in Spanish.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan of many words I see,\u201d Jess crosses her arms. \u201cCute though. Guess I won\u2019t be comin\u2019 back this month \u2013 you gonna\u2019 catch up for lunch or ya\u2019 pulling ma leg?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap picks up her bags for her, and claps the side of her arm, helping Jess towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo, or yer gettin\u2019 skelped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAye, fuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jessica waves to Ghost from over his shoulder, and once she\u2019s taken her bags back, she sacks Soap in the shoulder, and shuts the door behind her. Soap sighs, rubbing out his sore arm as he turns to meet Ghost\u2019s flat stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just got significantly more Scottish,\u201d Ghost says. \u201cAt least seventy percent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprisingly, <em>she </em>was the wild card of the family,\u201d Soap points, shifting the blame. Ghost doesn\u2019t look impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see the resemblance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shut up, I was way more responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap scoffs, flustered. He runs a hand through his hair, heart racing, because \u2013 <em>fuck, he really would\u2019ve preferred at least fifteen more years before they ever met \u2013 and goddammit Ghost is going to be so mad some rando saw his face \u2013 stupid, stupid \u2013</em></p>\n<p>Ghost pets under his chin. Soap should really be used to the teleportation act by now. He tips his head up, and Ghost leans down from his height to mouth across his temple.</p>\n<p>Oh. He\u2019s laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute, love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s entire body leaves his soul. Wait. Fuck. His soul leaves his body. They part fuckin\u2019 ways, okay, because <em>what. The hell. </em>He manages a series of sputtering noises, and eventually gives up when Ghost kisses the other side of his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a motorbike to show me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Soap croaks. He clears his throat. <em>\u201cYes. </em>Fuck that jog. You want to get out of here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost hums an agreement.</p>\n<p>Soap throws on cargos and a hoodie, and takes Ghost down to the garage, where his girl is sleeping under a cover. She purrs right to life, like he never left. Soap gets Ghost on the back of her, warms up the engine \u2013 and realizes how happy he is that they got the hell out of HQ.</p>\n<p>Ghost holds him loosely on one side of his waist, his other hand gripping the back of his bike, and it's no surprise that the helmet suits him so well. Soap takes them far out of town; to the country roads, and the rolling hills he used to play on. Eventually, Ghost's hand sneaks to his inner thigh and grabs him there, and it makes Soap smile under his visor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It instills a little piece of humanity into their souls. For when they\u2019re knee deep in the mud, stepping over the dearly departed, and carving sins into flesh \u2013 they\u2019ll have this moment to remember. Just for them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe prodigal son returns,\u201d Soap says, lifting his hand as he steps into the common area. \u201cPlease, hold your applause.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laswell breathes a laugh out of her nose, and swings back her whiskey. Price lowers his feet off the table only so Soap can scooch in on the couch and grab a drink. He kicks his feet right back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already have a favorite child, and it is clearly Gaz.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap scoffs, while Gaz makes a peace sign. \u201cI\u2019m offended, sir. You\u2019ve known him half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet I like him twice as much,\u201d Price counters. He slaps a palm on the top of Gaz\u2019s head, who blinks rapidly through the alcoholic haze. \u201cI would\u2019ve birthed him myself, If I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d Ghost says, not taking a seat, but accepting the whiskey from Laswell.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our last chance before half the squad comes back tomorrow,\u201d Price grumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re a day early, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap purrs, \u201cWe just missed you too much sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot bored of the sex already?\u201d Gaz teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, but a few more days I\u2019d be more stuffed than a\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Price shouts. \u201cDo <em>not </em>tell me. Open your mouth and you\u2019ll be scrubbing latrines, Sergeant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoap,\u201d Ghost warns.</p>\n<p>Soap surrenders, \u201cFine, fine. Just answering the question.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, you two\u2026?\u201d Laswell looks between Soap and Ghost. She\u2019s not disgusted, but genuinely surprised. \u201cClearly I missed a few steps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConsider yourself lucky,\u201d Gaz mumbles. \u201cGonna\u2019 need a lobotomy to forget the things I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost puts a firm end to the conversation. \u201cChange the topic or die.\u201d Thing is, that threat isn\u2019t even empty. A few bottles clink around while more rounds are poured.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe demoed the old watchtower while you were gone,\u201d Gaz says quickly. \u201cY\u2019know, to make room for that new training ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap\u2019s heart breaks in two. He leans over to grab at Gaz, but Price holds him back with a lazy palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou blootered <em>bastard, </em>you blew shit up without me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe construction crew had a deadline,\u201d Laswell shrugs. \u201cSorry kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo goddamn loyalty around here. I\u2019m calling Alejandro and moving to Mexico.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Price says. He leans a hand back to pat at Ghost\u2019s arm, like he knew he was hovering behind him all along. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got something you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soap makes eye contact with Ghost. There\u2019s no expression from the mask, but his eyes look\u2026alive. Almost happy.</p>\n<p>Soap grins, and kicks up his feet by Price.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot me there, Captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u272f\u272f\u272f</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there was a downside to their little vacation, it would be that Soap now has significantly less leverage out in the field, and it\u2019s not for the reasons you\u2019d think.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou bung this up, you\u2019re sleeping in your own bunk tonight.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like,\u201d Soap reloads his rifle, and takes out the sniper in the watchtower. \u201cThe crime doesn\u2019t fit the punishment here, L.t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ghost's soothing voice is a welcome comfort to his ears, even when he's angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJust get out alive. If I have to come rescue you, you\u2019re going to find out what real punishment is.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Soap grins, adjusting his scope. This whole job is less than ideal, but he can count his blessings that he\u2019s not in the sun, and he\u2019s not in the damn rainforest.
