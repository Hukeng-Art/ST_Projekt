  "text": "<p>1. First Years</p>\n<p>Omi Naoki walks up the path leading to the Height\u2019s Alliance dorms, hands sweating and pulse beating madly in his throat.</p>\n<p>He has a single flower clenched in his fist, and his heart on his sleeve, dressed in his best pair of jeans he owns along with a clean button down. Despite all this, he wears a confident smile on his face and his steps are steady.</p>\n<p>No one\u2019s ever denied Naoki when he smiled at them like this (whether it\u2019s part of his quirk or not, he doesn\u2019t know), and he\u2019s hoping that this time won\u2019t be any different (he <em>really</em> hopes this time won\u2019t be any different).</p>\n<p>Ever since the sports festival passed and Naoki saw the crazy green kid who broke all his bones just to win, he\u2019s been keeping an eye out for him.</p>\n<p>He was cute, obviously crazy enough to make things interesting, and just Naoki\u2019s type. He had smiled at Naoki after the first race and his wide, beaming smile immediately caught Naoki\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>From the little Naoki had been able to see during lunch and in passing hallways (and the odd moments Naoki saw Midoriya in the news, like that whole thing with almost being snatched by a Nomu in Hosu City, which, wild, but still attractive), Midoriya is sweet, earnest in everything he did, and manages to look cute through it all.</p>\n<p>Now that they were all stuck on campus in the dorms, Naoki figured he\u2019d take his chance and ask him out. Go on a date with him, see if they had any chemistry, and go from there.</p>\n<p>He just hopes Midoriya will give him a chance. Naoki might be in Gen Ed and Midoriya in the Hero Course, but he saw Midoriya trying to talk to Shinsou, who was the most unapproachable kid in his class, so Naoki figured Midoriya wouldn\u2019t care about all that.</p>\n<p>As Naoki walks up the steps, he fails to notice the figure leaning against one of the pillars to his right, instead choosing to focus only on the large doors in front of him.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t hear anything through the doors, and the sheer size of them is intimidating for no reason, considering his own dorms look almost exactly the same. It\u2019s the nerves, he knows this, but he gulps anyways looking at them.</p>\n<p>He straightens his clothes one more time, adjusts the single red azalea bloom in his left hand, clumsily brushes his white hair out of his face, and knocks on the door.</p>\n<p>With any luck, Midoriya will be the one to open it, but if not, Naoki has no issues asking one of Midoriya\u2019s classmates if they can bring Midoriya outside for him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat or two of silence that Naoki barely notices, then the door opens, and the loudest person Naoki has ever met (met as in seen him from afar and resolutely promised to never step within twenty feet of the guy if he could avoid it) steps into the doorway, but since he\u2019s so quiet compared to how he was in the sports festival, it takes a moment for Naoki to recognize him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHah? Who the fuck\u2019re you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spiky blonde hair, a permanent scowl to go with a gruff voice, and startling red eyes. Just Naoki\u2019s luck, it\u2019s Bakugou freaking Katsuki.</p>\n<p>Out of all of Midoriya\u2019s classmates, he\u2019s the last one Naoki was hoping to open the door. He\u2019d even rather face 1-A\u2019s hobo homeroom teacher then talk to Bakugou, who\u2019s known for his rude remarks and explosive temperament.</p>\n<p>But Naoki won\u2019t back out, not when he\u2019s literally on the doorstep, so he cements his smile and stands up straighter, bowing his head the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, I\u2019m Omi Naoki, from 1-C. I\u2019m looking for Midoriya Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes sure to keep his tone polite and even, but he still winces at the silence that follows.</p>\n<p>Bakugou was notorious for his anger more than he was for his win at the festival or for his kidnapping; Naoki doesn\u2019t want to get on one of the bad sides of Midoriya\u2019s classmates, let alone the one with anger issues.</p>\n<p>Bakugou narrows his eyes at him, gaze darting from the flower and Naoki\u2019s nice clothes to his face several times before he steps forward and onto the patio, slightly closing the door behind him until Naoki can no longer see into the dorms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Bakugou asks, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a question. His voice is low, dangerously quiet and nothing at all like the Bakugou Naoki had seen at the Sports Festival or on screen at Kamino Ward. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve a question I\u2019d like to ask him, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Naoki says, smile slipping when Bakugou takes another step forward, hands tucked into the pockets of his black sweatpants. Naoki can\u2019t tell if the step forward was threatening or not due to Bakugou\u2019s impassive face, but he fights the urge to step back all the same.</p>\n<p>Instead, he looks Bakugou up and down, analyzing him for any hints of his mood, but there\u2019s nothing there to give him away. No clenched fists, no tightened shoulders, no expression; it\u2019s terrifying.</p>\n<p>As Naoki studies Bakugou, who studies him right back, he finally notices the lettering on Bakugou\u2019s shirt: simple black kanji stating <em>T-Shirt.</em> It doesn\u2019t seem like something Bakugou would wear, but Naoki wisely keeps that comment to himself.</p>\n<p>His eyes flick back to Bakugou\u2019s face, but his mouth is in a flat line, his pale eyebrows are relaxed.</p>\n<p>There is absolutely nothing Naoki can see that warrants the feeling of dread crawling over his skin. The only hint Naoki has is that there\u2019s something about Bakugou\u2019s eyes that are raising the hairs on the back of his neck, something dangerous, but it\u2019s a warning that Naoki can\u2019t read.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what exactly,\u201d Bakugou says, his tone mild and red eyes piercing Naoki where he stands, \u201ckind of question is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Naoki frowns, a little shaken by the severe stare but mostly offended at being questioned by someone who had nothing to do with Midoriya <em>or</em> Naoki.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrankly, that\u2019s none of your business, Bakugou,\u201d he says before he can help himself, hand clenching tighter on the flower. He can hear his pulse echoing in his ears, beating wildly for a different reason than before, but he doesn\u2019t take back his words.</p>\n<p>He just wants to see Midoriya, is that too much to ask?</p>\n<p>Bakugou ignores the fact that Naoki knows his name and growls, stepping forward with one hand coming out of his pocket to threaten Naoki, fingers curling around the smoke that\u2019s started to drift up from his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike <em>hell</em> it\u2019s none of my goddamn business, you-\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever he\u2019s about to say is cut short by the door opening again and a familiar voice calling out.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan? Where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Naoki can still feel his heart pounding against his sternum and the sweat beading on his forehead, but he lets slip a relieved smile at the sight of Midoriya standing in the doorway.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in gym shorts and slippers, a wide black shirt with <em>Aji-Fry</em> on the front hanging the slightest bit too big on his frame, and his hair is pulled back from his face by a hairband.</p>\n<p>He really is too cute, and Naoki can\u2019t wait to get to know him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, I-\u201d he starts, beginning to step forward, but he\u2019s immediately cut off by Bakugou whipping around and stomping up to Midoriya, blocking Naoki from view.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, I thought I told you to watch the eggs,\u201d Bakugou says, and continues to step closer to Midoriya than what\u2019s normal for friends or classmates.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did! I even took them off the pan once they finished! You were taking a while, so I came to see who was at the door,\u201d Midoriya defends, eyebrows furrowing as he stares the slightest bit up at Bakugou, but Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem uncomfortable at the invasion of his space.</p>\n<p>If anything, he seems to be leaning in even closer to Bakugou.</p>\n<p>Naoki\u2019s eyes narrow, darting between Bakugou and Midoriya as they talk, comprehension beginning to dawn on him.</p>\n<p>It finally clicks, Naoki\u2019s mouth falling open, when Bakugou slips an arm around Midoriya\u2019s waist and tugs him into his side, leaning down to speak into his ear. Whatever he says flusters Midoriya so bad he throws his arms up in front of his blushing face, eyes squeezing close.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Midoriya whines, voice high-pitched in embarrassment, and Bakugou only smirks, tugging at Midoriya\u2019s waist and leading him back into the building while his eyes are still closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever,\u201d Bakugou says, tossing a smirk over his shoulder to a gaping Naoki as he kicks the doors to Height\u2019s Alliance shut with his heel, hand still clutching possessively at Midoriya\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>As the door closes, Naoki can just see Bakugou leaning his face down into Midoriya\u2019s hair, presumably to kiss his head, and Naoki flushes a bit at the intimate act.</p>\n<p>The door clicks shut, echoing a little, and Naoki wilts, letting himself feel the tiniest bit sad without anybody to see him throw a self-pity party.</p>\n<p>Well, that didn\u2019t go as planned. At least no one else was here to witness the whole mess.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not heartbroken, per se, but he had been looking forward immensely to talking with Midoriya, maybe holding his hand on the walk back.</p>\n<p>Rejection is still rejection, even when not intentional, and it stings a little.</p>\n<p>He drops the hand holding the azalea bloom, looking dejectedly at it. Now what is he supposed to do with the flower, let alone his morning?</p>\n<p>As Naoki turns to go back to his own dorm, feet dragging behind him, a loud slurping sound echoes to the side of him, and he startles, yelling from the abrupt noise and his free hand jumping to his chest to clutch the fabric right above his heart.</p>\n<p>A tall figure steps forward from behind the shadow of a pillar, and Naoki immediately feels flustered over the fact that someone <em>had</em> seen everything and was still here.</p>\n<p>He grips a little tighter to his shirt once he sees who exactly had seen it all.</p>\n<p>A head of hair split between red and white steps forward, a yogurt pack in hand, and Naoki feels his stomach drop straight to the floor. </p>\n<p>Great, it\u2019s Todoroki Shouto, the guy Midoriya beat by breaking his bones and then immediately befriended.</p>\n<p>Naoki starts to stumble over his words, voice rushed and panicked as he gets stared down by <em>another</em> one of Midoriya\u2019s classmates, feeling his blood curdle in his veins at the hard gaze.</p>\n<p>Jeez, what was 1-A\u2019s teacher feeding them?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw- oh my gosh, you were here- I didn\u2019t know Midoriya was- I mean I only wanted to-\u201d he stammers, defending himself for reasons he can\u2019t explain as Todoroki simply continues to stare at him and drink his yogurt, not saying anything.</p>\n<p>Naoki doesn\u2019t need to explain his reasoning to Todoroki, but with every passing second that Todoroki\u2019s eyes don\u2019t blink, and he continues to drink his yogurt, Naoki can feel the marrow in his bones withering away.</p>\n<p>The longer Todoroki stays quiet, the more Naoki fumbles his words, getting less and less incoherent the higher pitched his voice goes.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Naoki runs out of steam and things to say, his face a bright red as he waits \u2013 for what, he doesn\u2019t know, but since Todoroki is still there, still staring at him, Naoki waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour name is Omi, right? You know,\u201d Todoroki finally says, pulling the yogurt away from his mouth, his other hand stuck in his pocket nonchalantly, \u201cMidoriya\u2019s taken. By Bakugou, in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>He starts to walk forward, pace unhurried as he says, \u201cI thought everybody knew that.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, Todoroki brushes past Naoki and into the building, closing the massive doors once again without sparing a backwards glance to the stunned Naoki still standing on the porch with a flower in hand.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck,</em> he thinks, shivering at the sudden frigid air surrounding him.</p>\n<p>Why did it seem that everybody Midoriya surrounded himself with were supremely scary for no reason when Midoriya alone seemed to be sunshine incarnate?</p>\n<p>Naoki feels it\u2019s quite safe to say that there will be no first date with Midoriya, if Bakugou or Midoriya\u2019s friend has anything to say about it, let alone Midoriya, who hadn\u2019t even noticed Naoki was there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Second Years</p>\n<p>Shibata Kazuo stands in front of the huge class 2-A door, pulse fluttering in his throat with a mixture of nervousness and anticipation. His palms are damp with sweat, and he kind of wants to dive back into his bed and under his covers for the next century, but he\u2019s already here.</p>\n<p>This is it: he\u2019s finally going to confess to Midoriya Izuku, his long-time crush. There\u2019s no turning back now.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about him makes a smile curl on Kazuo\u2019s face, his expression slightly dopey as he thinks about Midoriya\u2019s smile and his freckles and the view of his strong back covered in green lightning and his always determined glowing eyes.</p>\n<p>Ever since Kazuo and the rest of Class 1-A shared a class with Midoriya\u2019s own hero class, Kazuo\u2019s been smitten, having fallen head over heels for Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Midoriya was so <em>kind,</em> so smart and beautiful when they were all introduced to each other and forced to work together.</p>\n<p>Midoriya had been paired with Kazuo for some brief one-on-one time that Kazuo\u2019s teacher and 2-A\u2019s teacher set up with the upperclassmen, and Kazuo was certain then and there that he just met an earth angel.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a couple months since then.</p>\n<p>A couple months of seeing Midoriya in the hallway and waving shyly, of seeking him out for advice or company after school (Okay, it only happened once, but Midoriya didn\u2019t even seem bothered that Kazuo had stopped him to ask questions and catch up. (Kazuo resolutely ignores the part of his memory where Bakugou had stood at Midoriya\u2019s elbow and bared his teeth at Kazuo and the flash of fear that had run through his body at the sight. No, he won\u2019t let one of Midoriya\u2019s weird classmates ruin the memory of Midoriya smiling enthusiastically down at him.)), of getting to work with him in some classes, and Kazuo decided it was now or never.</p>\n<p>Kazuo will confess now and spend the remainder of the year at Midoriya\u2019s side. All that time he spent fantasizing about holding Midoriya\u2019s large hands and sitting with him at lunch is finally getting the chance to become reality.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t always going to confess at first, as Midoriya is constantly surrounded by his classmates or is busy with training and internships, but he\u2019s especially always hanging around with Todoroki and <em>Bakugou</em> whenever he\u2019s not with his friend group.</p>\n<p>(Kazuo still doesn\u2019t know how Midoriya can stand to be around someone who\u2019s always so\u2026 <em>angry.</em> That\u2019s gotta get tiring after a while.)</p>\n<p>Kazuo was worried at first, thinking Todoroki and Midoriya were an item with how close they seemed to be, and that that meant Kazuo had lost his chance, but there weren\u2019t any concrete rumors about Midoriya being in a relationship.</p>\n<p>Kazuo took it as a sign to make the first move, to confess and ask Midoriya on a date.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath in and immediately chokes on it when he hears a bubbly voice call his name, spluttering as he gulps for air.</p>\n<p>\u201cShibata! Hey, what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kazuo turns around, catching his breath, and grins, seeing another one of his upperclassmen.</p>\n<p>Ashido Mina stands next to him, a wide, curious smile on her face as she waves at him. She\u2019s always really fun and interesting in their shared classes, constantly upbeat and excited, so Kazuo relaxes a bit, feeling some of his anxiety drain away.</p>\n<p>She probably knows whether Midoriya is in a relationship or not and can answer some of his questions before he marches in and snatches Midoriya for himself.</p>\n<p>God, even thinking of Midoriya as <em>his</em> makes Kazuo\u2019s heart stutter in his chest. Hopefully, soon, it\u2019ll be true.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Ashido,\u201d he greets with a small bow of his head. \u201cI was hoping to, um, talk to Midoriya for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya?\u201d she asks, tilting her head to the side curiously. \u201cWhat do you want with our Mido?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kazuo blushes at her phrasing and the brief mention of Midoriya, looking to the side.</p>\n<p>Ashido smiles deviously, obviously smelling weakness and leaning in closer to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asks, peering curiously at his blush.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to- you see, I need to tell him- I need to tell him something important.\u201d Kazuo can barely get the words out, stammering as his blush intensifies when Ashido snickers a bit.</p>\n<p>Kazuo can tell she\u2019s not laughing meanly, but the fact that he can\u2019t even <em>talk</em> about the fact that he\u2019s confessing with Ashido, who has nothing to do with the situation, is more than embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ashido asks again, still smiling slyly.</p>\n<p>Oh, fuck it, might as well ask her now before he dies of nervousness.</p>\n<p>Kazuo straightens his shoulders, and looks her directly in the eye, but Ashido only seems to be more amused at the sudden change in his temperament.</p>\n<p>\u201cAshido, can I ask you something?\u201d he ventures, eyes darting around her face for any signs of rejection or annoyance.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoot,\u201d Ashido says, placing her hands on her hips and grinning.</p>\n<p>More people are in the hallway now, as it\u2019s getting closer to the start of their first period, and Kazuo steels himself, intent on confessing before the hallway fills with more students and Midoriya\u2019s classmates all show up.</p>\n<p>Kazuo looks up at Ashido, hands fisted at his side, and asks the one question that could derail his entire future.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to confess- no, I\u2019m <em>going</em> to confess to Midoriya today, but, uh, before I do that, can you tell me: are Midoriya and Todoroki dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>By the end of the question, he\u2019s blushing again, the rosy-red spreading across his face in splotchy sections, and he ducks his head to hide as best he can underneath his dark bangs.</p>\n<p>Ashido bursts out laughing, clutching her sides, and Kazuo's head shoots up, feeling a bit hurt at her gleeful chortling. It\u2019s tinged just a bit with a sadistic edge Kazuo doesn\u2019t completely understand, and it causes many of the people walking past them to turn and stare at them both with confusion.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, honey, you sweet, sweet, summer child. It's not Todoroki you have to worry about \u2013 they're just friends,\" Ashido says, shaking her head with a vicious grin.</p>\n<p>He perks up, eyes brightening and the hurt falling away as quick as it came. \"Really?!\"</p>\n<p>Ashido shakes her head again, still laughing a bit, but the previous part of her sentence finally catches up to Kazuo.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what do you mean Todoroki\u2019s not the one I have to be worried about? I thought he was the only one Midoriya might have been dating\u2026?\u201d he questions, fidgeting at the smug expression on Ashido\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>She looks over Kazuo\u2019s shoulder, and her grin gets wider, a little meaner, and Kazuo can feel apprehension start to trickle down his spine.</p>\n<p>\"No, you should be worrying about <em>him,\"</em> she says, jutting her chin forward to indicate something behind Kazuo.</p>\n<p>As if on cue, a low, echoing growl travels through the halls, and Kazuo feels his heart immediately pick up, beating wildly in his chest and so hard it almost hurts, his palms starting to sweat as he goes cold with fear.</p>\n<p>The growl is ferocious and violent, dipping and rattling around inside of Kazuo\u2019s head as he starts to turn his face to look behind him.</p>\n<p>The growl gets louder, sharper, and Kazuo freezes. He stares up at Ashido, eyes wide and terrified as the sound gets closer and closer until it's almost directly behind him.</p>\n<p>Why isn\u2019t she doing anything? Why isn\u2019t she helping him and instead is simply smiling down at him? Kazuo\u2019s breath stutters, his lungs filling and releasing unevenly.</p>\n<p>Ashido steps back, and Kazuo almost reaches out to grab her, begging her to not leave him with whatever <em>thing</em> is behind him.</p>\n<p>Kazuo hears an explosion before he gets the chance to move towards her and he jumps, a small scream tearing itself from his throat. He still he doesn't turn around, trembling in place as his own scream echoes in his ears.</p>\n<p>He can feel the urge to run clawing at his throat, the desperation to <em>move,</em> to <em>hide</em> before whatever beast that\u2019s stalking up behind him can tear him to pieces.</p>\n<p>Kazuo\u2019s heart is pounding in his ears, the faint whooshing sound of his own pulse echoing each footstep behind him as it gets closer and closer and <em>closer,</em> it keeps getting <em>closer.</em></p>\n<p>Kazuo\u2019s knees shake with each heavy step, flinching violently at another sudden explosion, and he gulps, preparing to fire off his quirk from the tips of his fingers. Quick bursts of water shot over his shoulders should give him enough time to escape but he can\u2019t <em>move.</em></p>\n<p>He can\u2019t move, he needs to move, <em>he needs to-</em></p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kazuo hears the voice of an angel before he can gather his strength and see what monster is behind him, and he almost slumps to the floor in sudden relief, his muscles unlocking and air suddenly rushing into his lungs.</p>\n<p>Kazuo hadn't even noticed when the door to class 2-A opened, hadn't even noticed when <em>he</em> suddenly stepped out of the room.</p>\n<p>\"Kacchan! Good morning!\" <em>he</em> calls, unafraid of whatever is behind Kazuo.</p>\n<p>Midoriya's sweet voice cuts through the growl, and the rumbling stops behind him entirely, but the silence only puts Kazuo more on edge, his breath catching in his chest again.</p>\n<p>\"Deku,\" it growls, a deep, thundering sound that easily rattles Kazuo\u2019s ribs.</p>\n<p>Midoriya steps into Kazuo\u2019s view, and his smile changes from delight to a sympathetic frown, freckles moving with the change in expression.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, that kind of day, Kacchan?\" Midoriya asks, and whatever he sees must give him his answer, because Midoriya reaches his hand out, opening and closing it like he wants the monster behind Kazuo to grab his hand.</p>\n<p>\"Come here, Kacchan, we have a couple of minutes before homeroom starts.\"</p>\n<p>Kazuo shakes as a large, pale hand, with strong veins lining the back and faint star\u2010burst scars curling out from underneath the palm, reaches out directly past his head and over his shoulder. He can feel the change in the air as it moves past him, almost but not quite brushing Kazuo\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Kazuo can\u2019t help the flinch at the touch, shoulders jerking up and a whimper hiding pitifully in his throat.</p>\n<p>The hand grabs onto Midoriya's firmly, fingers clutching tightly, and starts to move forward and past Kazuo\u2019s head once Midoriya gives it a light tug towards himself.</p>\n<p>That hand turns into a sleeved arm, into a shoulder with the singular gold button that signifies the hero course and into Bakugou <em>fucking</em> Katsuki.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s profile is highlighted by the light of the sun through the windows, putting the side of his face that faces Kazuo into the shadows. Only the faintest hint of red peeks out, and Kazuo can't stop himself.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck,\" Kazuo whispers, and jumps when twin pools of blood red eyes twitch towards Kazuo and fix their heavy gaze on him. Kazuo\u2019s knees lock, his own eyes stretched wide and petrified.</p>\n<p>Bakugou turns his head somewhat out of the shadows, half of his face suddenly shown in stark relief and sharp, jutting angles, a play of shadow and light that only serves to make him seem <em>inhuman.</em></p>\n<p>He's baring his teeth at Kazuo, genuine, frothing anger set deeply into his face, and he looks like he's about to rip Kazuo's spine out with nothing but his teeth and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Kazuo squeaks, taking a timid step back, but Bakugou's already turned his attention back to Midoriya, getting tugged into their classroom by a fearless Midoriya who had just called for his attention with another sickeningly soft, \"Kacchan.\"</p>\n<p>They walk into the classroom without another word, still holding hands, and the door slides softly shut behind them.</p>\n<p>Midoriya didn\u2019t even look at Kazuo once.</p>\n<p>The hallway is almost empty, the silence echoing, and Kazuo jumps again, screaming out when a hand is placed unexpectedly and <em>heavily</em> on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>He had forgotten all about Ashido, and he\u2019s paying for it now as he clutches at his chest and wheezes, eyes staring unblinkingly at the floor in front of him as his heart protests the millionth scare it went through in the last two minutes.</p>\n<p>\"I told you,\" Ashido says, voice sadistically gleeful. \"Todoroki's not the one you need to worry about.\"</p>\n<p>Kazuo understands now, he really does.</p>\n<p>Kazuo\u2019s been dead since he first met Midoriya and disregarded the angry guard dog at his side; he can see that now.</p>\n<p>Midoriya was never Kazuo\u2019s and never would be, if the scary, blonde bastard always with him had anything to say about it.</p>\n<p>Kazuo simply values his life more than he minds his aching heart.</p>\n<p>The next time Kazuo sees the spot of green that makes his heart flutter in the hallway, he immediately turns around, the sight of the blonde hair and scowling visage with an arm thrown over Midoriya\u2019s shoulders enough to make his palms sweat and fear pool in his gut.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see the triumphant smirk crawling up Bakugou\u2019s face as he runs away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Third Years</p>\n<p>Two of the Big Three walk in, and Saizen Junko\u2019s breath catches in her throat. They\u2019re broad shouldered, stares heavy, and tall in more than just height. Their mere presences loom over her class, pressing down on them and demanding their attention.</p>\n<p>The twist of the blonde one\u2019s mouth and the flat, cold stare on Endeavor\u2019s kid\u2019s eyes curls her skin, a faint shudder crawling up her back.</p>\n<p>They look out at the classroom, the angry one making brief eye contact with her \u2013 Junko can feel her life lose a few years from the brief moment where it felt like he was looking <em>through</em> her, as if she wasn\u2019t even significant enough to be the dirt under his boot \u2013 and looking wholly unimpressed by what they\u2019re both seeing.</p>\n<p>It might be her imagination, but it feels like the room is suddenly colder, frost crawling up Junko\u2019s fingertips and locking her limbs.</p>\n<p>She wants to crouch under her desk and hide, wants to avoid their piercing stares and merge with the feeling like she\u2019s nothing more than a fly on the wall.</p>\n<p>The angry one\u2019s lip curls, his sharp canines flashing in the classroom lights, and Junko automatically braces herself, hands gripping the edge of her desk and muscles tightening, preparing for <em>something</em> she can\u2019t quite comprehend.</p>\n<p>These two are the leaders of the next generation of heroes? How the hell is she supposed to fight villains when she can\u2019t even handle being in the same room with the people she would hopefully become comrades with?</p>\n<p>The blonde one growls something under his breath, earning a sharp, quiet reply from Endeavor\u2019s kid, and she starts to fold over her desk unwillingly, taking in a sharp breath as quiet as she can.</p>\n<p>The sheer oppressive aura from these two as they trade barbs under their breath, chests puffing in agitation and hands clenching at their sides as they grow more irritated with each other, presses on her ribs until she finds she almost can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>Cold sweat beads at the nape of Junko\u2019s neck, and she peeks to the side, surprised by how unsurprised she is to find many of her classmates in the same position as her.</p>\n<p>She forces her head forwards again, straining all the while, and gapes at her homeroom teacher. He\u2019s standing in the corner of the room, completely unbothered (<em>smiling</em> even) by what he can hear from the two, and Junko kind of wants to go home rather than sit here for another second.</p>\n<p>The two upperclassmen in the front don\u2019t even seem to notice the class\u2019s reaction, eyes continually darting to the door as they trade verbal blows.</p>\n<p>What are they waiting for? Their third companion?</p>\n<p>Junko doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to handle it \u2013 if the two in front were already this intimidating, this daunting and unapproachable, she can\u2019t imagine what all three of them together would be like, can\u2019t imagine just how terrifying the third one must be as well.</p>\n<p><em>Please,</em> Junko thinks, as the door opens and both upperclassmen at the front perk up at the sound, cutting their conversation short in favor of turning to the doorway. <em>Please, no more.</em></p>\n<p>The door slides open completely, and the silhouette hovers in the frame for a few seconds, a bulky figure to easily compliment the large figures of the other Big Three already in the room, and Junko swallows, her tongue sticking to the roof of her dry mouth.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re easily shorter than both blondie and Endeavor\u2019s kid, but just as muscular. They fill out their uniform from what she can tell from the shadows, tight across their shoulders and chest, almost straining. They stand firm, shoulders set confidently with the ease of knowing intimately the weight and capabilities of one\u2019s own power.</p>\n<p>Oh, <em>fuck.</em> There\u2019s no way they won\u2019t be just as terrifying as the other big three.</p>\n<p>He steps forward into the room, and it\u2019s like Junko can breathe again.</p>\n<p>She gasps quietly, body slumping and releasing itself from its tense state as she drinks in the open smile, the wild, green hair, and the easy tilt of his head. He has freckles on the side of his face that she can see, and they crinkle and move with his smile.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re adorable, and they fit him astonishingly well, despite the brawny shoulders and thick torso to match his thick legs.</p>\n<p>Junko gulps, a faint blush staining high up on her cheeks as she forces herself to look only at his face and not the rest of him. He obviously deserves her respect if nothing else. With the way he walked in and changed the whole atmosphere, he must be something even beyond the two already at the front of the class.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s like a breath of fresh air, like the sun after days in the dark. He feels <em>safe</em> and Junko almost wants to cry out of pure joy.</p>\n<p>Her eyes dart to the blonde and multi-colored kid, worried and curious as to how they\u2019re receiving the <em>god</em> that just walked in (because what the hell else could he be, being able to calm down the two monsters at the front of the room with just a look), and feels even more shocked from their expressions then from the green hero that just walked in.</p>\n<p>The angry one is smiling. <em>Smiling.</em></p>\n<p>He looks like he just saw a newborn child and burned down a building, like he\u2019s eating his favorite food and just learned a new way to kill someone, like he was just told he became the number one hero and like he just won the biggest fight of his life. It\u2019s soft and sharp at once, with hidden layers Junko can\u2019t catch, slightly feral with the peek of a canine at the very edge of his lip.</p>\n<p>It coils around his face, twists the sharp features into something Junko can barely understand as <em>delight.</em></p>\n<p>Who the fuck is this green god that just walked in, and what kind of power do they hold over the angry blonde?</p>\n<p>She looks over to Endeavor\u2019s kid and wants to drop her forehead to the desk.</p>\n<p>The look in his eyes has thawed over, an almost embarrassing softening at the corner of his eyes signifying\u2026 <em>fondness?!</em></p>\n<p>What the actual fuck.</p>\n<p>When he had first walked in, trailing after the slouching blonde, he seemed emotionless, if not angry as well \u2013 just a separate, detached, and empty anger, as cold as the blonde\u2019s was hot. Yet, one look at the green man in the doorway and every layer of frost and ice sloughed off at once, his shoulders slumping and spine relaxing in unison.</p>\n<p>The room is no longer as bitingly cold as before, and he looks content.</p>\n<p>Content with what, Junko has no idea. She kind of wants to throw herself out the window, but then Greenie starts to speak, and she immediately perks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d he says, and his <em>voice,</em> God, but his voice. Firm like a commanding angel and soft like the downy feathers of a baby bird, and Junko desperately wants to listen to him speak for forever.</p>\n<p>The blonde one\u2019s smirk grows larger, head lightly tilting in acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>His name is Kacchan? It doesn\u2019t fit him at all. It sounds like a nickname but too childish to be anything but a form of mockery. But the way Greenie said it was\u2026 soft, almost loving. Like there were decades of memories packed into one word, a command and a beckon all at once.</p>\n<p>Nothing about this situation is doing anything to convince Junko that the adorable and slightly scary boy that had walked in <em>isn\u2019t</em> a god.</p>\n<p>\u201cTodoroki,\u201d he greets next, turning with a soft smile to him and the Todoroki guy nods back easily, still smiling. It looks a little awkward, like his face isn\u2019t used to smiling all that much, but it\u2019s so genuine Junko thinks she just might cry.</p>\n<p>Greenie smiles back even harder, and Junko can definitely feel the tears prickling at the corner of her eyes from the force of his smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Junko\u2019s New God softly apologizes.</p>\n<p>Junko can barely hear him, his voice low and scarcely audible from the front of the classroom to where she sits in the middle of the room. She leans forward to try and hear him better, straining to catch his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might and Mr. Aizawa had some last-minute information about the raid next week \u2013 it just came in from your dad,\u201d he says, nodding at Todoroki at the end of the sentence. \u201cNothing urgent, but still necessary to know for later, after we finish with this.\u201d He gestures behind him to Junko\u2019s class, and Junko fights the urge to duck under her desk at the motion.</p>\n<p>Todoroki and Kacchan both perk up at Greenie\u2019s words, interest playing in their eyes.</p>\n<p>Did he just say All Might? The previous number one hero? Junko knows he teaches at UA now, but she doesn\u2019t have any classes with him this year, as he\u2019s solely been teaching the upperclassmen and working closely with the third year\u2019s hero courses.</p>\n<p>Wait, did he also mean Endeavor?</p>\n<p>Before Junko can begin to even try and properly slot this new information into her brain according to importance, Greenie speaks again, quickly shutting his classmates down before they get too excited, shaking his head with a fond smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you both later,\u201d he promises, and finally steps between them, naturally taking point in front of them, the other two flanking each shoulder like terrifying sentinels. \u201cWe already have a task at hand, don\u2019t we? It\u2019d be rude if we kept them waiting anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, he turns towards the class with a beaming smile, eyes narrowing and crinkling in the corners with apparent happiness.</p>\n<p>Junko\u2019s heart tries to leap from her chest, and she slams her fist right above it on her chest to try and still it.</p>\n<p>She ignores the weird look she gets from Goda, who has been staring at her (probably from all the weird wheezing noises she\u2019s been making since the Green God walked in) for a couple minutes now and trying to catch her attention.</p>\n<p>She ignores him and doesn\u2019t feel guilty at all because Greenie started talking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize for the tardiness,\u201d Greenie says, bowing slightly to the class. \u201cIt was both rude and a bad example, so I promise to avoid being late to any future meetings to the best of my ability.\u201d</p>\n<p>Junko wants to stand and pull him up, to let him know he doesn\u2019t need to apologize for something as insignificant as being barely late when his mere presence saved them all from certain death courtesy of the other members of the big three, but the Kacchan guy gets there before she even gets the courage to stand up from her seat.</p>\n<p>He tugs at his shoulder, pulling him up with brisk and sure movements, as if he\u2019s done it a hundred times before.</p>\n<p>\u201cTch, nothing to apologize for, dumbass,\u201d Kacchan says gruffly, laying a hand almost possessively on the back of his neck once he\u2019s standing upright. \u201cWe\u2019re here, so just get to the fucking point already and start the shitty introductions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki places a reassuring hand on Greenie\u2019s shoulder, nodding to Junko\u2019s quiet, dumbstruck class.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Midoriya, it was only a few minutes,\u201d Todoroki reassures. \u201cWe should get started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Greenie \u2013 Midoriya? \u2013 says, nodding his head with determination.</p>\n<p>He turns back to the classroom, seemingly uncaring for the hand gripping his neck or the other hand resting heavily on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello everybody, my name is Midoriya Izuku,\u201d he introduces with another wide smile, bowing slightly again. \u201cI\u2019m from class 3-A, and it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises his right hand, gesturing over his opposite shoulder at Todoroki, and Junko immediately notices that it\u2019s covered with gruesome scars twisting around the front and back, disappearing into his sleeve. Despite the grisly scars, his hand doesn\u2019t shake. They\u2019re slightly intimidating, fingers all gnarled and twisted under each one, and Junko wants to trace them with her fingertips.</p>\n<p>Before Junko can punch herself in the chest again for the strange urge, Midoriya speaks up, introducing Todoroki.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my classmate, Todoroki Shouto, also from class 3-A,\u201d he says, and Todoroki briefly dips his head, face a blank slate again, the smile from earlier gone as he addresses her class.</p>\n<p>Midoriya drops his hand and smiles even further (Junko feels like that shouldn\u2019t be possible, but she\u2019s not complaining as she basks in his presence), shoulders turning slightly to the angry blonde.</p>\n<p>Kacchan, was it? Such a strange name.</p>\n<p>Midoriya almost looks like he wants to be bouncing on his toes, the excitement at announcing his other classmate vibrating his entire body.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this is-\u201d he starts, but he\u2019s cut off by a gruff, low voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Bakugou fucking Katsuki.\u201d Blondie punctuates his sentence with a hushed snarl, taking a half-step forward and making half of Junko\u2019s class (including herself) flinch back in their seats. </p>\n<p>Todoroki rolls his eyes at the domineering display, turning towards Bakugou with a bored look, and drops his hand from Midoriya\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>(Ah, Junko remembers Bakugou from the previous sport festivals. Can\u2019t believe she forgot, what with the continuous angry face and booming voice.</p>\n<p>So\u2026 not Kacchan. Why\u2019d Midoriya call him that then? Is it his hero name?</p>\n<p>Junko eyes Bakugou critically, noting the angry furrow in his eyebrows and his constantly tensing and curling hands.</p>\n<p>No, too friendly and childish for a hero name considering the guy looks like that split second of quiet before dynamite goes off and his presence feels like the physical manifestation of a Molotov cocktail.</p>\n<p>Then why that name?)</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki asks, lips quirking in a sardonic smile. It\u2019s terrifying, and Junko wishes he would just stop smiling entirely if that\u2019s what the other versions of his smiles look like.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot a fucking problem, Icy-hot?\u201d Bakugou snaps, dropping his own hand from Midoriya\u2019s neck to turn threateningly towards Todoroki.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s suddenly an oppressive weight on Junko\u2019s lungs, the room plunging into tight tension as the two stare each other down.</p>\n<p>Not again, she <em>can\u2019t</em> go through this again, she really can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Before she even has the chance to brace herself for whatever the hell happens when those two argue, Midoriya turns around, placing a hand on Bakugou\u2019s shoulder and shooting a smile in Todoroki\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>And, immediately, just like earlier, they calm down, Bakugou leaning into Midoriya\u2019s touch and Todoroki\u2019s shoulders slumping as he returns a fond smile back at Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Okay, literally what the fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Midoriya softly reprimands, sliding his hand down and squeezing his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this done with, yeah? We can all spar later, but please don\u2019t make the students cry. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again? Junko\u2019s honestly not surprised but she swears to steer clear of Bakugou as much as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, what-the-fuck-ever,\u201d Bakugou grumbles, but he doesn\u2019t shake Midoriya\u2019s hand off. His anger still simmers just below the surface, like oil waiting for a spark to catch, but he calms down a bit.</p>\n<p>Midoriya merely raises an eyebrow at Todoroki next, and Todoroki backs down, slightly chastised. He still shoots a look at Bakugou, who sneers right back as soon as Greenie turns around.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlrighty!\u201d Midoriya suddenly claps, loud and sharp, and Goda almost falls out of his chair next to her, along with most of her classmates who are still recovering from the stand-off between Todoroki and Bakugou.</p>\n<p>Junko snickers, ignoring the sharp look Goda shoots at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve introduced ourselves, I\u2019ll tell you why we\u2019re here!\u201d</p>\n<p>His cheery voice makes her class perk up, excitement bubbling in the air. The Big Three don\u2019t just show up in first years\u2019 classes for no reason, after all. Junko bounces in her seat, unbelievably eager for whatever Midoriya has to tell them.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, we\u2019re going to take you all down to Gym Gamma, and you\u2019ll be joining with Class 1-A. I highly encourage you all to change into your gym uniforms and bring any support items you <em>have</em> to use. But! Only bring them if you have to,\u201d Greenie explains, grinning wider at the wide array of expressions he must be seeing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo cheating, or else you can say goodbye to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some people look shocked and Bakugou snickers behind Midoriya, excited at the prospect of destroying property.</p>\n<p>From confusion to palpable eagerness, Midoriya takes all their reactions in eagerly, his wide smile settling into his face steadily.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, no, I\u2019m not joking,\u201d he says, and Junko believes him.</p>\n<p>Bakugou grins madly, stepping up to Midoriya\u2019s side, and Todoroki steps forward as well, but his face remains neutral. It\u2019s just as terrifying as Bakugou\u2019s \u201cI eat babies for breakfast\u201d smile simply because Junko can\u2019t discern any level of emotion from him, which could mean <em>anything.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOnce everybody shows up to Gym Gamma, we\u2019ll explain the exercise we\u2019re doing further. Be prepared for anything! After all, here at UA, we go beyond!\u201d Midoriya calls, putting his fist in the air and waiting with giddy anticipation for the class to finish the phrase.</p>\n<p>Bakugou rolls his eyes, but raises an open hand to shoulder height, small explosions popping in his hands, and Todoroki raises an unenthusiastic fist of his own, staring off into the distance somewhere.</p>\n<p>Midoriya only grins wider and clenches his fist tighter, enthused by his friends\u2019 lukewarm support.</p>\n<p>Junko grins, her bones thrumming with exhilaration, her own fist joining the air as she yells out with the rest of her class, \u201cPlus Ultra!\u201d</p>\n<p>The class soon devolves into excited chatter from there, everybody getting up or putting their things away.</p>\n<p>Junko peeks up at Midoriya again, standing slowly from her seat and watching as he enthusiastically talks with their teacher, hands moving in broad gestures and curls shaking with his nodding head.</p>\n<p>Bakugou stands fairly close to his side, almost touching, and makes juvenile faces at Todoroki. Todoroki doesn\u2019t even seem to notice, grimacing at something on his phone. It\u2019s not nearly as interesting as watching Midoriya be so absorbed in his conversation.</p>\n<p>Goda shakes her from her stupor, rattling her brain as he takes hold of her shoulders and yanks her back and forth roughly. She yelps, eyes breaking from Midoriya to look down at Goda in surprise.</p>\n<p>He simply raises an eyebrow when she blushes at being caught staring at Greenie.</p>\n<p>\u201cSaizen, what\u2019s wrong with you? I\u2019ve literally never seen you blush at anything before \u2013 it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says, stepping back from her and stuffing his hands in his pockets.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shorter than Junko, coming up to her nose on his tiptoes but still taller than most of her classmates, and has pale blue hair with long eyelashes that flutter over dark eyes \u2013 and if Junko\u2019s being honest, the ugliest fucking smile she\u2019s ever seen (which she thinks with fondness).</p>\n<p>She huffs, trying to force her blush down through sheer force of will, and stacks up the books on her desk to slip them into her bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, shut up,\u201d Junko says, before standing to her full height, peeking over the heads of her classmates to see if the rest of her classmates were ready to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he says sarcastically, rolling his eyes, but stands as well, a grin tugging the edges of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou excited for the exercise?\u201d Goda asks, rolling back and forth on the balls of his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, even though we don\u2019t know jack about it,\u201d she says, smiling back, a mixture of excitement and nervousness humming in her veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, did you see the way that Midoriya kid came in and immediately calmed them down?\u201d Goda says, turning towards the front and beginning to walk up the aisle to the door, following the flow of the rest of their class. \u201cDude, I wanna fight him, I bet it\u2019d be fun. You think that\u2019s what the exercise is, sparring with them one-on-one? They told us to be in our uniforms and bring our support items, so it\u2019s possible. If so, I can\u2019t <em>wait</em> to take him on.\u201d</p>\n<p>At Greenie\u2019s name, Junko perks up, tuning out the rest of Goda\u2019s rambling and looking to the front corner of their room in hopes of catching a glimpse of him again.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s nowhere to be found, and neither are the other Big Three, the space vacated and only their teacher standing at the door, directing their class out and to the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>She sighs wistfully, murmuring under her breath absentmindedly as she thinks of Midoriya\u2019s smile. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Goda reaches back and flicks her in the forehead, snorting when she cries out in offense.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think we have different meanings of what 'take him on' is implying,\u201d he says, hooting when Junko dives for his neck and misses, intent on putting him in a strangle hold and her face blushing madly.</p>\n<p>Junko can hear Terada laughing at her from the back of the classroom and sees all the semi-sarcastic agreeing nods from different classmates about 'taking Midoriya on' from the corner of her eye as she reaches for Goda again, and <em>God,</em> she really wishes she could jump out of a window right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d she cries out and chases him out of the classroom.</p>\n<p>They trip and shove each other down the halls and stairs, pulling their classmates into their game until they have to split for their respective locker rooms, both of them breathing heavily and in satisfaction for landing solid hits on each other.</p>\n<p>Junko races through changing into her gym uniform, hastily brushing her dark hair back from her face and meeting back up with Goda as they quickly walk to Gym Gamma. The nervousness is starting to set in now that they\u2019ve changed clothes and locations, and their walk to the gym is easily quieter compared to their game of punch-tag in the hallway earlier.</p>\n<p>When they walk through the doors, they see Class 1-A already milling about, standing in the center of the empty room, and talking in groups.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see them?\u201d Goda asks, craning his neck back and forth for any sight of the Big Three.</p>\n<p>Someone from Class 1-A answers his question, shaking their head and stepping forward. \u201cThey weren\u2019t here when we came in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re here yet,\u201d Junko agrees as their class combines with Class 1-A\u2019s, and immediately eats her words, yelping when she hears a familiar, low but loud voice behind her suddenly answer their question.</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong!\u201d he yells, laughing when Junko spins around, expression harried and fists up.</p>\n<p>Bakugou cackles freely, uncaring for the frightened expressions his laughter brings. Junko relaxes, but only marginally. How can someone so loud sneak up on all of them so well?</p>\n<p>The Big Three stand a good distance behind them, all in various states of dress. They\u2019re all still in their uniforms, but their jackets have been taken off, all their ties missing.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s shirt is unbuttoned\u2026 quite a bit, actually, and Junko fights from staring at the muscles of his chest for too long (he might honestly have a bigger chest than she does), the remaining buttons from mid-chest down straining to hold his shirt together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still untucked like it was when he walked into their classroom, but now Junko can see that he\u2019s wearing a short-sleeved button up, hands stuffed in his pockets as the short sleeves practically cling to his biceps. He stands aloof and unbothered, a smug grin sitting on his face as he judges them all.</p>\n<p>Junko avoids his gaze and looks at Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s wearing a normal, long-sleeved button up in contrast, but his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, defined forearms on display as he folds them across his chest. If Junko squints, she can see the faintest hints of red hair on one arm and silvery-white hair on the other. Huh, so not a dye.</p>\n<p>His shirt is also unbuttoned, but only by one, the collar open and his shirt tucked in. He looks like he wants to be anywhere but here, highly disinterested as his eyes dart between one student and the next.</p>\n<p>Junko avoids his gaze, too, and steels herself, clenching her fists and praying for stability before she finally looks at Midoriya properly for the first time since they came into the gym.</p>\n<p>She still feels the breath get knocked from her chest for absolutely no good reason, because compared to his companions, Midoriya is dressed almost exactly the same as he was before, disregarding the jacket and the tie.</p>\n<p>His shirt is buttoned up all the way to the collar, his sleeves buttoned at the wrists and covering the scars that continue to crawl up underneath the fabric, with his shirt tucked firmly into his pants. He\u2019s even wearing a belt, with a subtle All Might insignia on the buckle.</p>\n<p>Junko fails to ignore the way his pants seem significantly tighter around his thighs than both Bakugou\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s.</p>\n<p>And as she continues to fail at keeping her eyes from trailing downwards, she notices that Greenie has some strange metal contraption on his red high-tops, covering the toes and connecting around the back. Junko peeks at Bakugou\u2019s and Todoroki\u2019s shoes, but they\u2019re both wearing their own boots, different in style but nothing even close to the black metal on Midoriya\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>They look heavy, like every step will shake the ground, and Junko starts to feel her gut tighten up with anxiety.</p>\n<p>Goda might be right.</p>\n<p>The Big Three take point in front of the combined classes, simply waiting shoulder to shoulder with Midoriya once again in the middle as they wait for all the first years to quiet down.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re all quiet enough to hear a pin drop, Midoriya takes point once more, face neutral and hands flexing at his sides. He looks determined, the easy grin from before gone and his green eyes flashing in the gym lights.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy own upperclassman did this once with my class,\u201d Greenie starts, and for some reason, both Todoroki and Bakugou grimace, Bakugou pouting behind Midoriya.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the time, it was only my class and one of the Big Three that fought us, but in honor of both tradition and the changing future, I thought it would be the quickest and most sufficient way of showing you all the work and time it\u2019s taken for us to reach the point we\u2019re at today, with both our quirks and the knowledge we\u2019ve gained.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya lifts his fist, and Junko gasps in awe along with everybody else at the green lightning that flickers over his knuckles and around his wrist. His shirt seems to strain the slightest bit around his arms as the lightning flows freely around his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll all be starting your own internships soon,\u201d he says, letting the lightning die out, \u201cand some of you will quickly begin your work-studies after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya makes eye-contact with Junko, and she shivers at the intensity in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese weeks where you\u2019ll work in close contact with heroes of your choosing will be some of the most important hands-on experience you\u2019ll gain during your time as a UA student. It\u2019ll be hard, it\u2019ll be tiring and at some points frustrating. You\u2019ll see where you want to be, see the heroes directly in front of you with all their strength and experience and compare it to the progress you\u2019re making, and be disappointed at the pace you\u2019re going, at the minimal amount of growth that you can see.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestures to himself and to the other Big Three, who have gone still as they watch Midoriya with the same rapture their classes are watching him with. Junko\u2019s breathing has stilled, as she sees Midoriya speak with a passion she rarely sees in those around her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see us, and you won\u2019t see the years and years of work and blood and sweat we\u2019ve poured into honing our quirks and building our strengths. You\u2019ll see our quirks before you see us, and then you\u2019ll see us as we are now, graduates almost ready to join the field, stronger and more ready than you are right now, and you\u2019ll want to be stronger, quicker, smarter as soon as possible to reach the level we\u2019ve struggled to achieve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to <em>work,\u201d</em> Midoriya says. \u201cYou need to learn and struggle and fail, and then recognize your potential and capabilities. These work-studies and internships will be crucial for that \u2013 but only if you take it seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya suddenly grins, and rolls his shoulders back, stepping back to be in line with Bakugou and Todoroki, who have shifted their stances to be lower, bodies more parallel with the ground and their hands faintly stretched out from their bodies.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut talking about it will only convince you so much,\u201d Midoriya declares. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll show you the product of these work-studies and our constant struggle to get better, to be the best, to be a hero the people can count on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou suddenly speaks, voice a low-timbered growl, grinning maniacally. \u201cBring it the fuck on extras! I\u2019ll beat you all!\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya grins wider, if that\u2019s even possible, and nods his head. \u201cFight us, show us what you\u2019ve learned! And we\u2019ll show you just how much we\u2019ve learned!\u201d</p>\n<p>Junko gulps, swallowing sharply. Fuck, Goda <em>was</em> right. Are they crazy?! They\u2019re third years! They\u2019re the Big Three! And they wanted them to fight?!</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Junko\u2019s teacher says, but he\u2019s not even looking at her class! \u201cTry not to kill anyone,\u201d he advises, and he\u2019s smirking at the Big Three, stepping back towards the wall. Junko wonders if this is what betrayal feels like, as she watches him leave her and her classmates to the wolves.</p>\n<p>They all stand there, quirks activated and ready to go at the earliest moment, and Junko puts her fists back up, taking her usual stance. The air is thick with anticipation and anxiousness, and Junko shakes a little as adrenaline starts to flood her veins.</p>\n<p>Goda is bouncing back and forth on his feet, a manic grin of his own on his face as he stares directly at Midoriya, but still, no one moves.</p>\n<p>At least not until Bakugou screams, \u201cDIE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Several of her classmates automatically scream back in fright, and it starts.</p>\n<p>Their classes run forward, sizing up the Big Three, and immediately get knocked out by an exploding fist, courtesy of Bakugou who had immediately jumped into the fray.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a whirlwind of shouts and grunts, quirks firing off everywhere as all forty students attempt to simply <em>touch</em> Bakugou and Todoroki. They\u2019re getting knocked down and out like flies, one by one, left to right, and Midoriya hasn\u2019t even joined the fight yet.</p>\n<p>Junko barely steps back as Todoroki skates by on his ice and knocks Terada off his feet and a good ways away, immediately whirling around in a swirl of flames to flip Watase onto her back.</p>\n<p>Bakugou is cackling madly as he blasts off left and right, obviously having fun, and Junko avoids him as best she can, seeing from the corner of her eye Goda breaking off from the main group and sprinting directly towards Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Junko will bring flowers for his grave, as long as she doesn\u2019t die here as well, as she ducks and weaves between the whirlwinds that are Bakugou and Todoroki.</p>\n<p>To be fair, Midoriya seems to be taking Goda seriously, furrowed brows and a determined set to his mouth preceding the shift in his stance as he crouches closer to the ground.</p>\n<p>Goda lashes out first, hands dark green and glowing, but Midoriya easily dodges, tripping Goda up right after.</p>\n<p>As Goda falls, Junko can hear Midoriya call out praise to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a good first move! A little rash, but clearly well practiced and angled,\u201d he says, as he jumps over Goda\u2019s leg sweep. \u201cI recommend trying to telegraph it less in the future, maybe faking the first move to take your opponent off guard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Goda gets back up, blushing, and reaches for Midoriya again, who says, \u201cAh, a five-finger activated quirk, interesting. You should definitely look to work with a close combat hero,\u201d and then immediately punches \u2013 albeit <em>softly</em> \u2013 Goda in the head, who drops like a sack of potatoes.</p>\n<p>Junko\u2019s mouth drops open, and then she falls to the floor as Katsuya goes flying over her head, a screaming Bakugou giving chase and instantly catching up to her classmate, tackling her to the ground.</p>\n<p>Midoriya jumps into the fray as soon as Goda falls to the floor without a sign of getting up and starts to take on multiple students at once, giving them no time to adjust to the new opponent \u2013 all while throwing out words of encouragement and bits of advice as he takes them down.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even seem to be using his quirk, and Junko can literally feel herself falling in love as she watches him fight like he\u2019s having fun, like they\u2019re actually a challenge for him to take seriously.</p>\n<p>The metal shoe finally seems to be put into use as Junko sees Ueno charge at Midoriya, antlers first, only for Midoriya to easily sweep him away with a high kick, his foot slamming into Ueno\u2019s side with a solid sound and flinging him into a kid from 1-A.</p>\n<p>He turns around, and Junko realizes he\u2019s looking at her. It\u2019s her turn.</p>\n<p>She ducks in, using her height over Midoriya to try and land a punch, hoping it\u2019ll make contact and allow her to take in some of his strength, but he easily dodges, and lashes out with another kick, the same one he used on Ueno.</p>\n<p>Junko jumps away from its range, ducking under it and throwing another punch.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood job!\u201d Midoriya calls, delighted even as he avoids her fist. \u201cStudying my moves from another fight and putting it to use! That\u2019s some good observation skill!\u201d</p>\n<p>The praise stuns Junko, and she suddenly stops, standing in a dazed stupor and slightly swaying as a deep, intense blush climbs over her face. She stares wide eyed at Midoriya\u2019s smile and doesn\u2019t even notice when the top of his foot connects with her ribs, kicking her across the room.</p>\n<p>She goes down, and stays there, grinning like a dope up at the ceiling and ignoring the various screams as the rest of her classmates succumb to the might of the Big Three.</p>\n<p>Greenie praised her! He smiled directly at <em>her</em> and praised her! And the flexibility of his kicks, the strength and force of his legs\u2026 Junko\u2019s sufficiently gone.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s out of it for the rest of the fight (which is barely a minute more) and stays in that haze for a while longer even as Goda reaches down and pulls her upright.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s muttering something that sounds suspiciously like <em>fe fi fo fum</em> as he hauls her upright, complaining about her height the entire time, but Junko doesn\u2019t even have the spare brain cells to punch him for it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s still thinking about the moment Midoriya smiled at her before kicking her across the room.</p>\n<p>When they join the others, all nursing their own minor injuries, the Big Three start talking.</p>\n<p>Junko barely listens as Midoriya explains that they didn\u2019t win over both their classes just because their quirks were strong, but because they worked hard and pushed themselves to their absolute limit, and beyond.</p>\n<p>When he talks about their experiences in the work studies and accepts questions from her classmates, she formulates a plan.</p>\n<p>After they\u2019re dismissed, she\u2019s going to find Midoriya, and talk to him.</p>\n<p>To say or do what, she doesn\u2019t know yet, but she doesn\u2019t want the giddy feeling in her chest to go just yet and being around Midoriya is like being in the direct presence of the sun \u2013 addicting, a little dangerous, but so warm and bright she can\u2019t help but want to stay in its light for a while longer.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s staring at Midoriya while he talks, her face visibly lovestruck and covered in a heavy blush. She doesn\u2019t notice the frowns Bakugou directs at her, or the way he steps closer and almost possessively to Midoriya\u2019s side, a hand resting on his lower back as he talks.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re dismissed to change, and Junko anxiously waits as she watches the Big Three disappear out a different door than her class and Class 1-A. They break off, Midoriya and Bakugou going left, while Todoroki goes right with a wave goodbye to the other two.</p>\n<p>Shooting a quick glance at her teacher to make sure she\u2019s not being watched, she darts towards the door Bakugou and Midoriya walked out of, turning left as soon as she\u2019s outside.</p>\n<p>Junko frowns, looking for Midoriya in the empty space, but he\u2019s not there. There\u2019s nothing here, really, except for the corner of the building and some grass, so Junko slowly walks towards the corner, a little wary.</p>\n<p>As she gets closer to the corner, she hears sounds, strange sounds, almost\u2026 <em>wet</em> sounds.</p>\n<p>She creeps closer, peeking around the corner, and immediately twisting back around and slamming her back against the wall, hands coming up to cover her gasp before it can escape.</p>\n<p><em>Oh my god!</em> she thinks, face heating up. There\u2019s no way, absolutely no way. She looks again, quickly, and immediately slams herself against the wall again. <em>Holy shit!</em></p>\n<p>She peeks back around, slower, more carefully this time, and watches as Bakugou absolutely <em>devours</em> Midoriya\u2019s mouth, head twisting and tongue moving as he sucks Midoriya\u2019s soul out of his body.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s pushing him against the wall, both hands on Midoriya\u2019s ass, Midoriya\u2019s legs wrapped tightly around Bakugou\u2019s waist, but with his knees hooked over Bakugou\u2019s arms, feet dangling with the weight of his metal-covered shoes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s such a provocative image, the position too similar to that of one without clothes on, that Junko can\u2019t help her desire to be the one holding Midoriya up, to be the one between his thighs, to make him dazed and flushed with desire, lust spilling out of him.</p>\n<p>But it's <em>not</em> her who's doing all this to Midoriya. It's fucking <em>Bakugou</em> of all people, and Junko has never felt more jealous in her life.</p>\n<p>When she focuses back in on Midoriya after trying to compose herself, she sees spit escaping from the corner of his mouth, and immediately fails at keeping her composure, muffling a squeak with her hands.</p>\n<p>Midoriya is as red as Junko feels, eyes half-lidded and hands clutching desperately to Bakugou\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>His shirt\u2019s a mess, the previously buttoned collars at his neck and wrists suddenly open, the fabric rumpled and creased, red marks littering his now bared neck and leading down to his chest \u2013 he looks utterly debauched, courtesy of Bakugou, and like he\u2019s <em>enjoying</em> it.</p>\n<p>Bakugou backs off with a wet <em>pop</em> and Midoriya gulps in lungfuls of air, chest heaving and mouth open as he tries to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s staring up at Bakugou with his desire flayed directly on his face, a spacey smile turning the corner of his lips, and Bakugou stares right back, licking his lips hungrily and smirking at the sight in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Junko hears, a soft, breathy moan of Bakugou\u2019s name, and Junko wants to <em>scream.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, why are you-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looked damn good out there, baby,\u201d Bakugou growls, and Junko has to hide another gasp, twisting back around the corner and sinking to the ground.</p>\n<p>She rests her head on her knees, eyes wide and unseeing as she tries to comprehend everything she just saw and heard, trying to ignore her own reactions and the desire to see Midoriya like that and in a million more ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we were just fighting with the first years,\u201d Midoriya protests, but it\u2019s interrupted half-way with another gasp, the wet sounds of kisses placed on skin invading Junko\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and you looked hot as fuck doing it,\u201d Bakugou says, and Junko peeks back around the corner, still on her ass on the ground, chest heaving despite doing absolutely nothing \u2013 but she can\u2019t help it; they suddenly got quieter.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re- Jesus save her soul, but they\u2019re <em>grinding</em> against each other, Bakugou\u2019s mouth completely covering Midoriya\u2019s whole, swallowing every sound he makes as he continually pushes Midoriya against the wall with his hips.</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s leg twitches, hands clutching Bakugou\u2019s shoulders with eyes rolling back as Bakugou gropes his ass, and Junko stands up in a hurry, blushing heavily as she runs back to the gym.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t give mind to the fact that she\u2019s making a lot of noise as she runs, nor to the way the door slams shut behind her as she sprints away, Midoriya\u2019s breathy voice echoing in her ears as she goes.</p>\n<p>She <em>needs</em> to get out of there before she does something stupid or develops anymore of a thing for Midoriya when he\u2019s <em>clearly</em> already taken.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Katsuki peeks from the corner of his eye, moving to mouth at Deku\u2019s neck and huffing in smug satisfaction when the dark hair of the tall, first year chick who had been making eyes at Deku the entire fucking day finally disappears.</p>\n<p>He grins wider against Deku\u2019s neck when the gym door bangs shut a few seconds later and Deku doesn\u2019t even notice, too caught up in Katsuki\u2019s touch and scent and desire.</p>\n<p>He backs off to look down at Deku, who\u2019s gasping and smiling from where Katsuki had shoved him against the wall and can\u2019t help the pleasant curl of affection and desire that twists in his chest when Deku murmurs his name and tugs Katsuki closer again by the grip on his hair. </p>\n<p>He tightens his grip on Deku\u2019s ass, traces over his freckles with his tongue, and kisses Deku until he can\u2019t breathe anymore.</p>\n<p>His, Deku is all his.</p>\n<p>The next time the Big Three do something involving Class 1-B, Katsuki takes immense satisfaction in the fact that the girl can\u2019t even make eye contact with him or Deku without choking on nothing and heavily blushing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. Sidekicks</p>\n<p>See, in retrospect, Eijirou doesn\u2019t think he can do anything more than he is right now. He also doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to do any more than he is right now, but that\u2019s irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Because, well, Midoriya just updated his costume, going for a more streamlined version of his previous suits to introduce himself as one of the new sidekicks at Endeavor\u2019s agency. Eijirou did the same when he joined Fat Gum\u2019s, so he gets it.</p>\n<p>Midoriya tightened some straps, added a few accentuating lines to help with his \u201cmovement speed\u201d (Eijirou\u2019s almost completely sure Bakugou was responsible for half of those updates), which, sure, yeah, Eijirou can see where it might have come into play with his actual hero work.</p>\n<p>The costume <em>also</em> emphasizes his, ahem, <em>assets,</em> if Eijirou was being completely honest \u2013 his bro has one hell of an ass, what can he say. Midoriya\u2019s PR Team was having a whole field day with his new updated look.</p>\n<p>Gone was the somewhat mousy but also scarily jacked high-schooler, and in his place is this adorably hardened soon-to-be Pro Hero.</p>\n<p>And sure, Bakugou\u2019s always been a little touchy about Midoriya, a little protective over their relationship due to all the unwanted attention and opinions they receive from strangers and the media.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always been a little needy and possessive over his man, just as much as Midoriya is over him. No big deal, they all knew how to handle him at his worst, Midoriya better than them all combined.</p>\n<p>And yeah, okay, most villains are pretty vulgar in hopes of catching the heroes off guard and messing them up. Eijirou gets that, he experiences it in most encounters with villains. They shoot off from the mouth whatever comes to their brain in the faintest hope that it\u2019ll give them a few seconds advantage to either run or one hit K.O. the heroes.</p>\n<p>Except, most villains seem to forget that the newest generation from U.A. regularly trained with Bakugou, so they were long desensitized to anything that was said to them. Even Iida learned to tune it all out and not rise to the bait, though he still manages to reprimand the villains for their language once they\u2019re in custody.</p>\n<p>But nobody can quite get under one\u2019s skin like a cocky Bakugou coming off several wins or an angry Bakugou coming off of several losses (thank you, Todoroki and Midoriya, for making it so much worse for everybody else on those days).</p>\n<p>But Bakugou just proposed last night (he had texted Eijirou out of the blue that he was \u201cgonna marry the damn nerd\u201d and then lo and behold, the massive group chat for all graduating heroes in their generation and their mentors got a text two hours later with Midoriya\u2019s distinctive hand bearing a shiny new ring with a simple lock and key emoji underneath the photo to announce his engagement), and today\u2019s the first day the new and upcoming Sidekick Deku is going out on patrol as a completely claimed man, gold ring and all, so honestly?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s shit luck on the villain\u2019s part, but\u2026 he also kind of brought it on himself.</p>\n<p>Eijirou watches the one-sided beat down with a mixture of amusement and sympathetic pain. He\u2019s half-heartedly holding Midoriya back (who is, to be fair, not even trying to step in, but Eijirou\u2019s gotta put appearances up for the media\u2019s sake), but mostly cheering his bro on.</p>\n<p>And, since Midoriya really isn\u2019t jumping in to stop it either, Eijirou doesn\u2019t feel bad about calling out wrestling moves to \u201cinspire\u201d Bakugou.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not surprised. Really. Eijirou could\u2019ve told anyone the outcome of this if they had only asked, but villains don\u2019t necessarily ask questions first, let alone permission.</p>\n<p>When they heard the cacophony of sounds that was the burglary gone wrong, Eijirou was already in the area, and had been meeting up with Deku for a quick five-minute break. They had been patrolling their own assigned sections but ran into each other by pure coincidence.</p>\n<p>Eijirou always loves seeing his friends while they\u2019re in uniform, as it leads to some pretty sick team-ups, so he had no problem walking and patrolling with Deku in his sector a little bit.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when they heard the screaming simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Some villain calling themself the Vengeful Raccoon (\u2026Eijirou doesn\u2019t even know, honest. He\u2019s there to take villains off the streets, not comment on their less than stellar villain names) had tried to rob a store but wasn\u2019t able to get far.</p>\n<p>Eijirou and Deku had arrived on the scene quickly, Deku pulling ahead with his speed as he always does and immediately engaging the villain while Eijirou went to pull a couple of bystanders that were standing too close to the scene away.</p>\n<p>But when Eijirou had turned back to the fight, assessing to see whether Deku needed back up or not, it was quite clear to him that it wasn\u2019t a normal villain fight, as the villain was evidently a <em>fan</em> of Deku\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Deku, how much for a little more private one-on-one, eh? I could show you a real good time, if you know what I mean,\u201d the villain calls out, dodging one of Deku\u2019s kicks.</p>\n<p>His greasy, slicked back black and white hair falls in front of his face, and he tries to toss it back in an artful manner, but honestly it just looks like he lost a fight with a garbage disposal. His beady eyes don\u2019t help, either.</p>\n<p>It costs him a direct kick in the head, given graciously by Midoriya\u2019s metal boots, but the villain springs up like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>He sways where he stands, though, so Eijirou assumes it\u2019s all for show.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Deku asks, spinning in place as he lands on the ground.</p>\n<p>Eijirou can tell that he\u2019s visibly confused, his speed faltering the slightest amount on the next kick, but Deku being Deku immediately recovers, lunging for the villain.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this mano a mano to a bed, do a little tango by ourselves,\u201d Raccoon leers, swiping at Deku\u2019s side and narrowly missing, his hits coming closer and closer the more flustered Deku gets.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?! Thank you?!\u201d Deku gets out, face red, and Eijirou can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from embarrassment or mounting anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m pretty on top of things as a villain in the underground; you wanna be one of those things?\u201d the villain asks, wildly lashing out at Deku\u2019s head and missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m good! I\u2019m really good, no thank you!\u201d Deku growls out, growing more agitated and more red as the villain keeps slipping between his hits and under his legs.</p>\n<p>Damn, his bro is so polite, especially to such a vulgar guy; Eijirou's proud of him. He doesn't know how long that'll last, though, because Deku's got a temper to match Bakugou's sometimes if the fights get long and frustrating enough. Which, the fight is certainly getting the more the villain spouts off.\n</p>\n<p>Eijirou feels for him, because most of this fight is being recorded, which means a lot of people are going to be seeing a raccoon-human villain hitting poorly on one of the most widely known and followed sidekicks. Oof.</p>\n<p>The villain pauses, panting with a wide grin, and rakes his eyes over Deku\u2019s body lecherously, mumbling to himself, \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to get my hands on that ass. Just a nice, quick slap. See a little jiggle, a little shake.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubs his hands together, well, <em>villainously,</em> and Eijirou shakes himself from his shocked stupor, eyeing a gaping and blushing Deku.</p>\n<p>Eijirou doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen someone, villain or otherwise, hit on Midoriya so vigorously or so bad that even the bystanders are cringing. Mostly because there\u2019s an explosive blonde deterrent usually stuck to Midoriya\u2019s side, so it\u2019s never really been an issue before.</p>\n<p>And, the few times Eijirou has heard about Midoriya rejecting people when Bakugou wasn\u2019t around, Bakugou came up quite consistently in Midoriya\u2019s refusals.</p>\n<p>Eijirou\u2019s about to join the fight, because hitting on his bro in public like this just isn\u2019t manly, especially when Midoriya\u2019s already in a relationship and visibly uncomfortable, but he doesn\u2019t need to.</p>\n<p>As the villain reaches out a hand clearly in the direction of Deku\u2019s ass with the explicit goal of slapping it, a depraved smirk on his face the closer he gets to his objective, a series of loud explosions accompanied by very familiar yelling echoes in the air around them.</p>\n<p>In a matter of seconds, the sounds go from mildly loud to absolutely ear-shattering, and one very angry sidekick by the name of Dynamight blasts his way into the fight, almost blowing the villain\u2019s hand off.</p>\n<p>\u201cHands <em>off</em> you bitch-ass motherfucker!\u201d</p>\n<p>The villain screeches in pain and surprise, rapidly flapping his hands to put out the fire on them, and Bakugou quickly pivots, snatching Midoriya up and dragging him out of the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the- Kacchan?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTap out Deku, he\u2019s mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay? But Kacchan, I had it handled!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, you pasty-ass garbage-looking rat, all you villains are-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he heard me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, probably not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kirishima \u2013 er, Red Riot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, bro?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Kacchan is okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe looks fine to me, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026You see absolutely nothing wrong with,\u201d Midoriya waves in front of him, gesturing to everything they\u2019re looking at, \u201cthis?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStand the fuck up you cock-sucking shitty bastard!\u201d An explosion emphasizes each insult. \u201cCome here so I can-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, man\u2019s just blowing off some extra steam, that\u2019s all. Yeah, use the Lion Tamer, Dynamight!\u201d Eijirou mimes the move.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare lay your filthy eyes on Deku or I\u2019ll blast your balls so far up your body that for weeks you\u2019ll be tasting your own-\u201d The villain\u2019s screaming isn\u2019t quite as loud as Bakugou\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not so sure, Kirishima.\u201d A collective wince from the bystanders.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at him go, so manly defending his fianc\u00e9\u2019s honor! Dynamight, The Chair! Give him The Chair!\u201d A bench is ripped up from the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop running you piece of shit, I\u2019m gonna fuck you up so bad you\u2019ll be shitting blood for months! Get back here so I can-\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the kids in the audience cackles in a way very reminiscent of Dynamight\u2019s cackling. Eijirou shudders at the similarity. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s sounding a bit more villainous than the villain himself.\u201d Another collective wince from the audience as Bakugou lands on the villain\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Eijirou grimaces, because Midoriya <em>does</em> have a point.</p>\n<p>He claps his hand on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder and walks towards where Bakugou is currently grappling the Vengeful Raccoon into submission.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Deku, I\u2019ll reel him in,\u201d he calls over his shoulder, hardening his body to deflect the various bits of shrapnel headed towards him as Bakugou explodes the ground around him.</p>\n<p>Bakugou continues letting out a never-ending litany of swears and insults, growing more vulgar and incomprehensible as he goes on. He\u2019s saying something about a \u201cdumbass felcher\u201d when Eijirou cuts in, laying a hand on Bakugou\u2019s heaving shoulders and tugging him away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it from here, Dynamight. Go check on Deku, or something, keep him company,\u201d Eijirou suggests, tugging Bakugou off the villain and wrapping a hardened hand around the villain\u2019s wrists. The villain doesn\u2019t even seem to notice, eyes dazed, lying face down and limp on the ground.</p>\n<p>Bakugou most definitely knocked something loose in the guy\u2019s head, considering the one-sided beat down Eijirou just witnessed.</p>\n<p>At the reminder of his fianc\u00e9, Bakugou is immediately off the ground and running across the street to where Midoriya watches with a somewhat confused and worried look.</p>\n<p>Eijirou watches Bakugou crowd Midoriya, taking his gloves off with his teeth so he can touch Midoriya\u2019s face with his bare hands. One of his hands tugs off Midoriya\u2019s left glove, fingers fiddling with the shiny ring there, the other resting itself possessively on the back of Midoriya\u2019s neck and underneath his cowl to pull him in.</p>\n<p>They share a moment, uncaring for the bystanders watching or the villain on the floor, eyes closed and simply breathing the other in.</p>\n<p>Eijirou has seen them do this same greeting multiple times before: sometimes, it\u2019s off a long day of patrol and they need to calm down, other times it\u2019s coming up on the tail end of a raid, a way for them to settle their nerves and promise to see one another on the other side, and a few rare times it\u2019s when they\u2019re both drunk out of their minds and forgot that everybody around them exists, walking like they've got one steady leg between them both and unwilling to stop touching the other.</p>\n<p>This time, it\u2019s to settle something instinctual that had come unhinged in Bakugou\u2019s chest, and to remind everybody else of their devotion to one another.</p>\n<p>Bakugou rests his forehead firmly against Midoriya\u2019s, and his fingers run gently up and down the back of his fianc\u00e9\u2019s neck while Midoriya places his free hand on Bakugou\u2019s arm, fingers squeezing tight into Bakugou\u2019s bare bicep.</p>\n<p>Eijirou turns around to give them a sense of privacy, a fond smile tugging at his lips as he hauls the villain up. Leave it to Bakugou to go from brutally kicking a villain\u2019s ass for a few solid minutes to gently holding his love close to him. Only for Midoriya and no one else.</p>\n<p>The villain stands shakily with a confused light in his eyes and easily follows Eijirou as he leads him to an out of the way spot as they wait for the police to show up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d the villain mumbles, head swiveling left and right, eyes unable to focus on anything \u2013 oof, the man probably has a concussion courtesy of Bakugou \u2013 as he tries to comprehend what just happened to him, \u201cthe fuck was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou forces the villain to stand upright, hands a firm deterrent against any escape, but the villain doesn\u2019t even seem to be considering it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very manly of you, Vengeful Raccoon,\u201d Eijirou reprimands, bringing the villain\u2019s attention back to him and away from Midoriya. Eijirou doesn\u2019t think the villain can handle anymore straight punches to the head from Bakugou <em>or</em> Midoriya.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d he spits up a mixture of blood and saliva onto the floor, head lolling to the side. \u201cThe fuck\u2019re you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d the villain slurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to hit on Dynamight\u2019s fianc\u00e9? While Dynamight was in the area? Not a good idea, bro.\u201d Eijirou shakes his head, <em>tsking</em> his tongue at him.</p>\n<p>The villain pales a bit, despite already looking thoroughly thrashed from the fight. \u201cF-fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eijirou grins savagely, leading the villain past where Bakugou and Midoriya are wrapped up in one another to the approaching squad car. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Deku\u2019s already taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d the villain manages, knees locking up, wide-eyes petrified when he makes direct eye contact with Bakugou over Midoriya\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s glaring at the villain something fierce, half of his face tucked down into Midoriya\u2019s neck, hand placed firmly on his neck and one finger brushing up and down the skin.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s ring finger glints in the afternoon light, and the villain pales further, knees giving up on him.</p>\n<p>Eijirou starts to drag him once his body goes limp, easily hauling his weight across the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit, oh, please, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d the villain rambles, face crumpling in despair.</p>\n<p>His voice warbles, tears springing up in his beady eyes as Eijirou grabs him by the back of his shirt to bring him upright for the cops cuff him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so fucking dead, I\u2019m gonna die, I\u2019m gonna die so many deaths, he\u2019s gonna fucking kill me, I didn\u2019t know, just kill me, please, help me-\"</p>\n<p>Eijirou laughs freely, shaking his head as he hands the villain off.</p>\n<p>Only Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>5. Pro Heroes</p>\n<p>Despite what most people might think, Katsuki is a patient man.</p>\n<p>The difference between him and others though is that Katsuki chooses when to use his patience, saves it for when he absolutely needs it.</p>\n<p>When Kaminari fucks up the communication tech after goofing off like a dumbass, Katsuki doesn\u2019t need his patience there. When Deku comes home, shaking and eyes blank from a failed mission, Katsuki needs his patience there.</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t see the point in patiently rescuing the dumbfuck who climbed up a tree and couldn\u2019t get down despite it being the fifth time they\u2019ve gotten stuck and had to be rescued, but Katsuki will be as patient as God Himself when he\u2019s working to make Deku come for the third time.</p>\n<p>As Katsuki watches from across the room, he digs deep into his chest and finds the patience he so rarely uses for anybody but Deku.</p>\n<p>This is the third time today the new intern \u2013 Katsuki couldn\u2019t give two shits as to what their name is, and it won\u2019t matter because they probably won't be here by tomorrow anyways \u2013 has distracted Deku with some inane flirting, distracted Deku away from <em>Katsuki.</em></p>\n<p>Katsuki shifts minutely on the desk he\u2019s leaning against, clenching his fists tighter together from where they\u2019re tucked against his sides, arms crossed against his chest to keep himself in check.</p>\n<p>He watches passively, face blank and mask off, eyeliner smudged after a full shift out on the streets. It\u2019s the loudest warning anyone would need, and it\u2019s obvious to all around him he\u2019s in no mood to be played with, but the intern takes no heed.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s not worried, is the thing.</p>\n<p>He knows Deku loves him, and that Deku knows he\u2019s Katsuki\u2019s heart manifested into a living, breathing thing. Katsuki knows that all the blood, sweat, and tears he\u2019s poured into their relationship has made it the strongest thing in his life, has made it so he\u2019s all but cemented himself at Deku\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not pissed.</p>\n<p>Years, they\u2019ve been married for <em>years.</em> Hell, they\u2019ve been together for more years than they\u2019ve been apart now, and still fuckers think they have a chance with Deku, let alone deserve to talk to him.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve even been publicly presented as a married couple for years, despite not being a hero duo, as fuck all that means when they take almost all their missions and assignments together. Anyone who interviews at their agency to join their team already knows that Katsuki\u2019s a married man, and that Deku specifically is <em>his</em> married man.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s something the intern has elected to ignore for some reason, to their own detriment.</p>\n<p>Katsuki continues to watch the intern clumsily flirt with an oblivious Deku, watches them choose to flirt in front of everybody and specifically in front of Katsuki\u2019s face, as if their meaningless words and paltry attempts for Deku\u2019s attention hold any weight, and lets it amuse him.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s begun to annoy Katsuki, begun to drain him of his tolerance, and he feels something shift in his chest. He clutches tighter to the smidge of patience he has, staring resolutely at Deku\u2019s side profile, and then forcibly relaxes.</p>\n<p>Not once does he look away from Deku, letting him finish his sentence in their conversation, before cutting the intern off.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku,\u201d Katsuki calls, eyes serious and pensive, his face neutral to the wandering eye. He doesn\u2019t get an answer right away, Katsuki\u2019s voice too low and the room too loud for Deku to hear him from across the room.</p>\n<p>But the intern notices, and draws Deku further into the conversation, flashing Katsuki a smug look over Deku\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>No matter. Katsuki knows Deku <em>intimately</em> well. It won\u2019t take much to truly catch his attention.</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises his voice, just a touch, and says, <em>\u201cHusband.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The room doesn\u2019t stop, the people around them don\u2019t look up, but it <em>stills,</em> hushes itself as Deku suddenly straightens up at Katsuki\u2019s call.</p>\n<p>Katsuki sees his shoulders hitch, just a little, and can imagine the little catch in his breath from the thousands of times before that Katsuki has heard it directly in his ear. Most times it\u2019s accompanied by the sweetest of whines, but Katsuki relishes in the faint blush that\u2019s started to crawl up the back of Deku\u2019s neck and over his face instead.</p>\n<p>Katsuki waits, still leaning against the edge of the desk with his legs spread and arms crossed, eyes glued to Deku, and he's soon rewarded.</p>\n<p>Deku turns around, and his own eyes are completely focused on Katsuki. Katsuki's lungs seize from the intensity of Deku\u2019s gaze and the ache he feels at forcing himself to stay still, to stop himself from launching across the room and taking Deku's face between his hands, but he still can\u2019t help the hint of a smirk tugging at his lips.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, he wants Deku\u2019s piercing stare only on him, and what Katsuki wants, he gets.</p>\n<p>Katsuki still doesn\u2019t move, but he tilts his head up, an indication for Deku to come over, beckoning him to come closer, always closer.</p>\n<p>And Deku immediately does, not even excusing himself from his conversation. He leaves the intern behind him without a second thought, and their expression is equal parts baffled and annoyed. They look two seconds away from stomping their foot in frustration like a toddler, and Katsuki quietly huffs in satisfaction.</p>\n<p>As Deku crosses the room like a man on a mission, people move out of his way, creating a clear path straight to Katsuki. It takes but a few seconds, and soon, Deku\u2019s directly in front of him. He steps in between Katsuki\u2019s legs, but he doesn\u2019t touch Katsuki when he himself makes no move to touch Deku.</p>\n<p>Katsuki can smell the slightest hint of his cologne, faint from a day\u2019s work of sweat and blood muddying the scent. It\u2019s all Deku, all his husband, and Katsuki can\u2019t help the deep sigh of pleasure he releases now that Deku\u2019s finally within Katsuki\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Kacchan?\u201d Deku asks, eyes imploring and bright as he looks up at him, Katsuki taller even while leaning back on the desk.</p>\n<p>Katsuki tilts his head down, bending forward just slightly, and lets his voice wash over Deku, watching as his eyes flutter shut.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhere are your eyes, Deku?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>I missed you, pay attention to me, look only at me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Deku\u2019s eyes open, his gaze firm, as if he could read all of Katsuki\u2019s thoughts from a few words alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn you, Kacchan, always on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Katsuki says, voice low but pleased.</p>\n<p>Katsuki already knew what Deku\u2019s answer would be, but each time he says it, confirms his affections verbally for Katsuki\u2019s own selfish desire to hear it aloud, Katsuki\u2019s heart grows another size, thudding painfully against his chest.</p>\n<p>Katsuki would answer the same, if Deku ever asks, would profess his love loud and clear for anyone to hear, but Deku seldom needs more than an <em>I love you.</em> Doesn\u2019t mean Katsuki doesn\u2019t constantly give him more, simply because he can\u2019t hold it all in his chest lest it burst \u2013 and Deku always deserves the most.</p>\n<p>Katsuki tilts forward, arms still crossed, and watches as Deku\u2019s eyes flutter shut once more.</p>\n<p>He lightly skims the shell of Deku\u2019s ear, a kiss that\u2019s barely even a brush of his lips and holds himself from doing more when Deku shivers. He makes eye contact over Deku\u2019s shoulder with the fuming intern, and smirks again, tonguing the rim of Deku\u2019s ear \u2013 and earning a delightful, muffled whine \u2013 just because he can, before turning his head to speak directly in Deku\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait for me at home, husband,\u201d Katsuki murmurs, and then he backs away, straightens his spine and shoulders as he looks down at Deku again, cataloguing his heady blush and open mouth and twitching fingers, storing it all away for future, <em>private</em> purposes.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s fingers ache to brush across Deku\u2019s cheeks, to tuck away slips of his hair and hold him close, but he can\u2019t, not yet. Not when Katsuki has something to do and something to say that would be at risk of tainting how he treats Deku in front of others.</p>\n<p>The reactions Katsuki gets from Deku are for Katsuki alone and the way he touches Deku is for Deku alone, for no one else\u2019s eyes, and especially not for someone as insignificant as the intern across the room.</p>\n<p>He raises his voice slightly, just enough for everyone in the room to hear him say, \u201cSee you later, Deku,\u201d and the quiet that had fallen over everyone is suddenly gone.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s coworkers and employees are abruptly hyper focused, each person steadily working on their own tasks, and Katsuki doesn\u2019t resist the urge to roll his eyes. Nosy bastards.</p>\n<p>His annoyance is tempered, as always, by Deku.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Kacchan,\u201d Deku promises him with a smile, and places a hand on Katsuki\u2019s shoulder for support as he leans in and kisses the edge of Katsuki\u2019s jaw, his lips scraping the skin deliciously and so much like when he\u2019s on Katsuki\u2019s lap, riding, moving at a leisurely pace \u2013 and Katsuki has to close his eyes to pray for restraint at the faint touch.</p>\n<p>Deku steps away, eyes dark and a promise for later, then exits the room, leaving to clock out for the day.</p>\n<p>Katsuki steadfastly watches him leave, silent where he sits, and only moves once the door has swung shut behind Deku\u2019s retreating figure.</p>\n<p>He uncrosses his arms to push off the desk with his palms and walks over to the intern, who suddenly looks like they\u2019re regretting all their life choices.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s arms lay deceptively lax at his sides, his hands loose and open as he walks at a steady, purposeful pace towards the other side of the room. For all intents and purposes, he appears calm, nonthreatening, so no one dares to impede his path.</p>\n<p>He stops right in front of the intern, bordering on leaning uncomfortably close, and says nothing for a very long and excruciating moment. He watches them fidget, shifting on their feet constantly and eyes darting to the people around them for silent support.</p>\n<p>But no one comes up to them, a wide berth of empty space suddenly appearing around them both as the people in the office let Dynamight handle the situation as he seems fit.</p>\n<p>Good to know his employees know when to do their jobs, Katsuki thinks, still watching the intern figure out whether to speak first or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cD-Dynamight, Sir?\u201d the intern stutters after a while. Katsuki can see them fighting the urge to step back into the wall behind them.</p>\n<p>Katsuki says nothing for a moment more, letting them suffer in silence, before he finally speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Katsuki warns, deadly quiet. He stares down at the intern, looming over them, his usual glare and livid voice noticeably absent.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about-\u201d</p>\n<p>The intern gulps mid-sentence, throat suddenly dry. Katsuki can see their throat working as they struggle to speak up and waits to see if they can pull themselves together and talk again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about what, Sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises an incredulous eyebrow, a sneer fighting to crawl over his face, and the intern stumbles back a step, bumping into the wall behind them with a loud thump.</p>\n<p>Still, no one comes to offer them absolution.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d Katsuki starts, speaking slow and firm, eyes piercing straight through the intern's shaky countenance, \u201cis kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki bends forward, his face cast into the shadows, eyes glinting like freshly spilt blood, and stops just a hairsbreadth away from the intern. </p>\n<p>This close, Katsuki can hear them taking short, gasping, almost inaudible little breaths, shoulders rising and falling at a rapid pace. Their eyes dart to and from Katsuki\u2019s face rapidly, as if they can\u2019t decide whether to stare Death in the face or not.</p>\n<p>Katsuki opens his mouth, and the intern flinches at the ice in his voice; his next words are almost a whisper, his voice a low rumble that seems to echo around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will find that I am not.\u201d</p>\n<p>It comes at a complete surprise to no one when the intern shows up to their shift the next day with their two weeks resignation in hand.</p>\n<p>Katsuki simply turns Deku away, a hand firmly around his waist, and listens to his husband talk about the details of a new case with a hidden, pleased smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>+1. Pro Heroes</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s pushing his shopping cart down the aisle, focusing so intently on the shopping list Kacchan had given him that he almost runs over the kind, elderly lady in front of him.</p>\n<p>He says kind because she doesn\u2019t immediately try to beat him with her ginormous purse for almost running her over, and instead quietly laughs at him when he prostrates himself in front of her for forgiveness, face blushing wildly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of that, sweetie, it was a simple accident,\u201d she says, and tugs gently at Izuku\u2019s elbow to pull him upright.</p>\n<p>Izuku stands, still blushing, and makes sure not to lean on the woman at all despite her offering him assistance to stand straight. He towers over her, and he feels clumsier then he has in years as he fidgets with his fingers and the bar of the cart, struggling to move it out of the way as she watches with clear amusement.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s wearing a colorful fruit-patterned button down tucked into a khaki skirt with shin-high green socks that are covered with dancing narwhals, and she shuffles along next to him in Jesus sandals. Her purse is a bright, bright red, almost half her size, and she has a basket also almost half her size filled with various miscellaneous foods and items in her other arm.</p>\n<p>Her outfit makes absolutely no sense, but it\u2019s something that Izuku himself might wear and he swears he\u2019s never seen a cuter old lady. He refrains from voicing that thought, though. Izuku's been told many, many times, by many, many people that his taste in fashion is horrible, so best not open that can of worms with a stranger.</p>\n<p>Instead, he tries to apologize one more time for running into her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019m so very sorry, I was just so caught up in my list \u2013 which is no excuse! Really, I should\u2019ve-\u201d</p>\n<p>She cuts him off before Izuku can spiral into a frantic storm of apologies, resting a gentle, weathered hand on his forearm, and leading him out of the aisle.</p>\n<p>\u201cHush now, it\u2019s alright,\u201d she says, using his forearm for stability as she walks slowly by his side.</p>\n<p>It's obvious she intends to talk with Izuku at length, so he easily steers the cart with one hand and let's her hold his other arm. He offers to take her basket and put it into the front of his cart, and she lets him with a wide, easy grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d she starts, amusement lacing her voice and watching Izuku settle her basket, \u201cit\u2019s not every day the number one hero tries to bash you with his cart, now, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku groans, blushing again at the teasing, but finally starts to relax as she intended, laughing gently along with her at the ribbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s unfair that you know who I am when I don\u2019t know who you are, but I think the whole cart incident makes up for it,\u201d Izuku laughs, tugging her gently out of the way of another shopper as they begin to walk again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would be correct,\u201d she agrees, winking as she says it, and Izuku laughs freely.</p>\n<p>As a hero, Izuku\u2019s willing to put his life on the line for anybody, with no discrimination, but there are some people he\u2019s more willing to sacrifice himself for than others, and this little old lady has already joined that list.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Kiryu Riona, and it is truly a pleasure to meet you Mr. Deku,\u201d she says, introducing herself to Izuku anyways, and she bows her head at Izuku.</p>\n<p>Izuku splutters, waving his free hand at her, but she ignores him and pulls him forward as she walks.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, the pleasure is mine, ma\u2019am, and Midoriya is fine; I\u2019m not on duty right now so you don\u2019t need to call me Deku, or mister, or anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me ma\u2019am again and I\u2019ll bash you with my basket,\u201d Ms. Kiryu says in lieu of a response, and laughs at the bewildered face Izuku makes.</p>\n<p>Her laugh is rough, a little raspy, but the laugh lines around her eyes and mouth crinkle like they\u2019ve always been there as her face twists in amusement.</p>\n<p>As Izuku looks down at her laughing at his expense, he can\u2019t help but be curious as to what this woman\u2019s life story is. She seems so content in her skin, talking to Izuku like he\u2019s a relative of hers, and looks like she has decades worth of stories just waiting to be shared.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, sorry, ma- er, Ms. Kiryu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow then,\u201d she says, and she plucks the list right out of Izuku\u2019s hand, shrewd gray eyes darting over everything Kacchan had written on it. \u201cWhat is the number one hero shopping for on this fine afternoon, and what unhealthy things can I convince you to get instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Izuku blinks. Wow, she moves a lot faster than Izuku would have expected from a tiny old lady.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat and tries to explain the list.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Kacchan, uh, that\u2019s my husband, told me to get this for dinner tonight, but I have no idea where to find some of these ingredients, so I\u2019ve just sort of been\u2026 wandering around,\u201d he trails off in embarrassment.</p>\n<p>Number one hero, sure, easy, no problem, that\u2019s understandable because he\u2019s been working at it his whole life. But when it comes to cooking, Izuku is nowhere near as knowledgeable or fancy as Kacchan is, and it\u2019s something Izuku has easily come to terms with.</p>\n<p>He can cook well enough to feed himself and others, but he\u2019ll never be the culinary genius Kacchan has always touted himself to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remind me of my wife,\u201d Ms. Kiryu muses, flipping the list over to read the back as she speaks. \u201cCould barely boil water, knew absolutely nothing about any of the recipes I talked about, but good lord if she didn\u2019t eat like her life depended on it. And not just food, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku chokes, face flushing a bright, uneven red, leaning on the cart for support as she laughs uproariously at his side. She ignores the looks of the shoppers around her, free in her amusement at Izuku's expense.</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Kiryu!\u201d Izuku wheezes out, and she nudges his side with her elbow, still laughing at him. Her voice peters out like the hiss of a clicking lighter as she attempts to contain herself, and it reminds Izuku a bit of Kacchan\u2019s laugh.</p>\n<p>How such a loud, joyful sound can come out of a tiny body, Izuku will never know.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, can\u2019t handle a little inappropriate talk, Mr. Deku? The youth these days, I swear,\u201d she says, shaking her head, and Izuku doesn\u2019t even try to fight the laughter bursting out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Kiryu, I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with my being young,\u201d he chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d she reaches up to pat the side of Izuku\u2019s face placatingly, \u201cbut don\u2019t tell me you never reward that husband of yours for cooking, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku squeaks, his face rapidly turning red once more, but he can\u2019t even deny it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ms. Kiryu says smugly, smoothing a hand over her gray hair and pushing some flyaways back into her bun. \u201cSo, let\u2019s get this husband something unhealthy and tasty, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head ruefully but smiles anyways. Kacchan deserves everything, including indulging every once in a while, but\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be too happy about getting junk food. He\u2019s never liked straying too much from our diets,\u201d Izuku tries to tell her as Mr. Kiryu steers him down another aisle, occasionally stopping as she throws various things into her own basket and into Izuku\u2019s cart.</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she says, brushing aside Izuku\u2019s words and checking things off Izuku\u2019s list with a pen she took out of her bun. \u201cHe\u2019ll eat what you give him or else he and I will have words about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sniggers to himself, laughing at the thought of this tiny, fierce old lady squaring up with Kacchan over food, and he can\u2019t deny that he wants to see her win.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see that,\u201d Izuku admits, reaching up for a bottle on a tall shelf at her request and placing it into her basket.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, to see the number two hero get his ass kicked?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stumbles on his feet, shocked laughter spilling out of him.</p>\n<p>Seriously, this woman! She said that so nonchalantly like taking on Dynamight is nothing more than putting a misbehaving miscreant into their place.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t fight my husband,\u201d Izuku wheezes, leaning over the cart heavily.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu removes her hand from Izuku\u2019s arm to rub his back in the most mocking gesture of comfort he\u2019s ever received \u2013 and his husband is Bakugou Katsuki.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if he behaves,\u201d she says, and moves away from his side to study a row of packaged cookies in front of her. Izuku hangs his head over his arms from where he\u2019s leaning on his cart and smiles in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he like to eat?\u201d Ms. Kiryu asks him, gesturing to the cookies in front of her like she said nothing out of the ordinary. Her voice makes him lift his head, and he looks over at the selection Ms. Kiryu just gestured at, musing over the choices.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan has a fondness for dark chocolate,\u201d he tells her, and she immediately snags one of the bags in front of her and tosses it over her shoulder without looking back. Izuku catches it easily, but it was headed directly towards his face, and he squawks in offense.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he cries out, gently setting the cookies into his cart.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has good taste, your husband,\u201d Ms. Kiryu says, talking over Izuku\u2019s cry as she moves to another section further down the aisle, but she looks over her shoulder and winks at Izuku as she says it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Uh, yes?\u201d Izuku confirms, but it\u2019s more like a question than an agreement.</p>\n<p>Dark chocolate <em>is</em> good, but what was with the wink?</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu simply hums with a smile, and keeps browsing, her big bag hanging from her elbow. Despite the size, it doesn\u2019t seem to weigh her down and she walks with a straight back, taking confident steps in her sandals.</p>\n<p>Izuku would offer to carry it for her, but he\u2019s afraid it\u2019ll have something like a couple of bricks in there and that Ms. Kiryu really would try to hit him with it, so he refrains. She seems comfortable as she is, anyways.</p>\n<p>They keep moving through various aisles, Izuku eventually getting everything on his list and a bit more at Ms. Kiryu\u2019s insistence.</p>\n<p>He makes sure to grab a couple of things for the twins, too. No doubt they\u2019d give him The Look and he\u2019d feel his heart break, so might as well circumvent that entire situation altogether.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re discussing the merits of Kacchan\u2019s favorite spicy chip brand versus Ms. Kiryu\u2019s various favorites that she declares are all better than Kacchan's when Izuku hears a high-pitched voice call for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d they squeal, and Izuku whips around, already with his arms out and a wide smile on his face as he bends down to catch Rikiya in his arms. \u201cWe found you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku wraps his hands around his son\u2019s waist before tossing him in the air, delighting in the screaming laughter that echoes around them. Rikiya is as loud as Kacchan was as a kid, and he gets louder every day, but Izuku loves it.</p>\n<p>Rikiya is so unabashedly himself and happy that Izuku can\u2019t help but encourage it. It comes back to bite him in the ass often, especially at bedtime or after a rough patrol, but the good far outweighs the bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did! Good job!\u201d Izuku praises, catching him easily and bringing him in a for a big hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi! Don\u2019t go running off, you brat!\u201d Izuku hears next, and his heart skips a beat, an even bigger smile crawling up his face at the familiar gruff voice.</p>\n<p>He turns around, holding Rikiya in one arm, and reaches his other hand out to Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan! Hi!\u201d Izuku says, watching fondly as Kacchan comes marching down the aisle with Saki still strapped in the baby carrier to his chest.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s awake, but just barely, her chubby cheeks squished against Kacchan\u2019s chest as her eyes blink open and close very slowly, and Izuku watches as she loses the fight, conking out after a few seconds. She has drool coming out of her mouth as she smacks her toothless gums together, and Izuku can\u2019t help the small coo that comes out of him.</p>\n<p>Adorable, his baby is adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad! Look, Dad is letting me ride his back!\u201d Mikio calls, and Izuku looks up with a smile to see that yes, Kacchan is <em>also</em> carrying Mikio, and he is indeed riding on his dad\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Kacchan rolls his eyes as he comes closer, carrying his own basket and Saki\u2019s diaper bag in one hand, and lifts one end of a leash in his other hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe burned it. Again,\u201d he tells Izuku flatly, but a smile is tugging at the corner of his lips. Well, there goes another leash.</p>\n<p>Mikio\u2019s quirk must have acted up, so Kacchan must have resorted to carrying Mikio on his back to keep him occupied and to keep an eye on him. Izuku can only shake his head fondly, counting the total in his head.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the third one this week. Not quite the record, but they\u2019re getting close.</p>\n<p>Mikio obviously feels no remorse, still wearing the backpack his leash is connected to and playing with the frayed, burnt end.</p>\n<p>Both Izuku and Kacchan were leash babies growing up, but Izuku was normally too shy to go off by himself and leave the shadow of his mom\u2019s leg. He was only a leash baby when he was with Kacchan, as Kacchan always wanted to go explore and break all the rules Mitsuki had given them when they went shopping, often dragging Izuku along with him.</p>\n<p>Once Kacchan got his quirk though, and started exploding his leash, Mitsuki made her own fire-resistant leash. Well, until Kacchan learned how to burn through those ones, too.</p>\n<p>Izuku might just need to call her and see if she has any leftover leashes from Kacchan\u2019s childhood.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Izuku says again, smiling when Kacchan comes closer and stuffs the leash into the diaper bag so he can grab Izuku\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kacchan greets back, and he pulls Izuku in to give him a simple kiss on the mouth, the blonde stubble on his chin softly scratching against Izuku\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd hello to you, too,\u201d Izuku coos, brushing the side of his finger against Saki\u2019s soft baby cheeks and kissing her blonde hair. She doesn\u2019t wake up, but she does snuffle in her sleep, a little snorting-grumble that means she\u2019s dreaming.</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a moment to lean into Kacchan\u2019s arm, keeping a firm grip on a twitchy Rikiya as Izuku looks down at their baby, and he can\u2019t help but want to cry at how content he is with his life. He sighs, but startles right after when he hears Ms. Kiryu\u2019s rough laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Deku, you didn\u2019t tell me you were also shopping for your kids,\u201d she chides him, but her twinkling eyes let him know she\u2019s more than delighted at what she\u2019s seeing.</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs sheepishly, but he does step out from Kacchan\u2019s side to introduce his family. He pats Kacchan\u2019s arm when he tenses up at Izuku\u2019s departure to let him know it\u2019s alright.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, of course, I apologize. Ms. Kiryu, this is our oldest twin, Rikiya,\u201d he says, and gestures to the fidgety boy in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi! I\u2019m Rikiya!\u201d Rikiya yells out, delighted to meet someone new, and Izuku winces.</p>\n<p>Rikiya has never had any semblance of volume control, and Izuku\u2019s ears are paying dearly for it. Kacchan laughs at him, and Izuku shoots him a look, eyes narrowed but smiling still.</p>\n<p>Kacchan seems to have forgotten that Mikio is also on his back and therefore right by his ear, and Izuku doesn\u2019t feel like reminding him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my dad!\u201d Rikiya announces next, and pokes Izuku\u2019s cheek with a sticky finger. He leaves his finger there, wiping whatever strange substance is on it onto Izuku\u2019s face and Izuku resigns himself to giving them all a bath after dinner tonight.</p>\n<p>They <em>just</em> washed the kids this morning. How did Rikiya already become so dirty? Izuku absently wipes at his cheek as Ms. Kiryu responds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Ms. Kiryu asks, but it doesn\u2019t sound sarcastic at all. She gives Rikiya her full attention, and Rikiya takes complete advantage of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! He\u2019s my favorite dad! Other than my other dad! He\u2019s also my favorite!\u201d Rikiya declares and Ms. Kiryu laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see, I see,\u201d she says, and Rikiya beams at her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have favorite dads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku cuts in before Rikiya can politely yell at her anymore, and gestures to Mikio, who has been kicking his legs in impatience.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one right there is Mikio,\u201d Mikio shrieks a hello at Ms. Kiryu and Kacchan winces \u2013 hah \u2013 at the direct assault on his own ear, \u201cthe other twin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu\u2019s eyes dart between Rikiya and Mikio with a growing smile. \u201cI can see the relation,\u201d she says, and Izuku chuckles.</p>\n<p>The only way to tell Rikiya and Mikio apart \u2013 excluding their quirks \u2013 is by their voices. They look exactly the same, down to their freckles, and they use it to their advantage <em>often.</em></p>\n<p>Izuku places a gentle hand on Saki\u2019s back right next to the hand Kacchan already has resting there, linking his pinky with one of Kacchan\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this sleeping rock is Saki,\u201d Izuku jokes, and Saki does absolutely nothing in response, still sleeping away in the comfort of Kacchan\u2019s hold. If the twins can\u2019t wake her up, then nothing will.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu takes a step forwards to properly see Saki\u2019s face from where it\u2019s smooshed up against Kacchan and partially covered with the carrier, and a sweet smile comes over her. The lines in Ms. Kiryu's face soften as she studies the sleeping baby, and she waves a hand at Saki, knowing Saki won\u2019t see it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s adorable, Mr. Deku,\u201d Ms. Kiryu says, sighing happily, and places the waving hand over her heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right she is,\u201d Kacchan cuts in, puffing his chest out proudly.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu steps back at Kacchan\u2019s voice and looks up at him with a critical eye.</p>\n<p>If Izuku looms over Ms. Kiryu, then Kacchan is like a giant, taller than both her and Izuku. Kacchan stares right back at her, unafraid of anything \u2013 even little old ladies with huge bags that probably have bricks in them.</p>\n<p>Izuku, who is a sane and normal person, appropriately fears said bricks and the little old ladies who carry them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, this is the husband, then?\u201d Ms. Kiryu asks, and Izuku can\u2019t quite parse out her tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, got a problem with it?\u201d Kacchan shoots back, eyebrows furrowing and taking a step closer to Izuku.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu says nothing, pursing her lips as she darts her eyes between the squirming boys who are talking to each other over their dads\u2019 shoulders, the sleeping baby, and Izuku, before going back to Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d she finally says, and nods her head in Izuku\u2019s direction, winking at Kacchan like she did at Izuku earlier, but Kacchan apparently seems to understand the secret signal because he relaxes, body easing out of its defensive posturing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I worked to keep him,\u201d Kacchan says, his voice a little softer than it normally is when talking with strangers. Ms. Kiryu seems to understand his cryptic wording, smiling in response.</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks between them, confused as all else.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asks. They both answer him simultaneously.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu pats Izuku\u2019s shoulder, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- what?\u201d He looks between them, bewildered, but Rikiya starts to squirm out of Izuku\u2019s hold, flinging his arms up and yelling for attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad! Dad! Guess what!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, remember, inside voices Rikiya,\u201d he futilely tries to remind his son, adjusting his grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Rikiya yells, and Izuku gives up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you want me to guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>As Rikiya points to something on the shelf that had caught his attention, speaking rapidly in a speed only understandable by Izuku, Kacchan, and his twin, Izuku somewhat overhears Ms. Kiryu talking to Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Dynamight, I\u2019ve convinced your husband to get a couple of things. Everything you eat is too healthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHah? The hell is wrong with too healthy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll suck all the joy out of your lives with too many vegetables. Now, if you include some nice sweets with every meal, your husband will only love you more. Trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku will eat what he\u2019s given, or he can cook his own shit. He already eats too much junk food; I\u2019m not giving him some goddamn sweets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBah! You will live a boring life eating like this, Mr. Dynamight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t give a shit, hag.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Dynamight, it is Ms. Hag to you, or Granny. Please, show some respect in front of your children and your lovely husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku crouches semi-frozen in front of the crackers, balancing on his heels as he listens with a dizzying mix of mounting dread and increasing bafflement to their conversation, almost falling on his ass when Kacchan gives one of his ugly half-snorting-half-chuckling laughs.</p>\n<p>Oh god, Ms. Kiryu can verbally spar with Kacchan better than half of their friends. Izuku is suddenly very, very afraid. He needs to separate them \u2013 and soon.</p>\n<p>Seeing them hit it off like a tiny, flaming lighter tossed directly into a barrel of napalm was not how Izuku expected this to go. Meeting new people is different for Izuku, because Izuku can latch onto and bond with pretty much everyone. For Kacchan, however, it takes weeks to get him to even consider talking to other people outside of work. Ms. Kiryu adopting Kacchan on sight and Kacchan semi-accepting it was the worst-case scenario that Izuku didn\u2019t even consider.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, Mikio comes to the rescue, wriggling dangerously on Kacchan\u2019s back, whispering loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad!\u201d he whisper-yells. \u201cDad, I need to tell you something!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku squints his eyes at Mikio, and slowly stands up, setting Rikiya on his hip. Rikiya, who is now talking to himself (satisfied that he\u2019s told his dad everything he wanted to), ignores his twin, as he usually does.</p>\n<p>Izuku recognizes that wriggle\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kacchan asks Mikio, stuffing something into his pocket that Ms. Kiryu had given him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hafta go pee, Dad,\u201d Mikio tells him, leaning down to cup his hand around Kacchan\u2019s ear like it\u2019s a secret. It would\u2019ve worked, except Mikio still doesn\u2019t know what a whisper is.</p>\n<p>Kacchan straightens his spine immediately, suddenly in Dad Mode, and Izuku does the same.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what it was! Mikio was doing his bathroom wriggle, except modified to incorporate the use of kicks because he\u2019s on Kacchan\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, kid, just hold on for a few minutes, yeah?\u201d he tells Mikio, sharing a panicked look with Izuku.</p>\n<p>Mikio only tells them he needs to go pee when he really has to go. Like, <em>really</em> has to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cGimme,\u201d Kacchan says, and holds an arm out for Rikiya. \u201cI\u2019ll take them and meet you at the car, \u2018kay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku kisses Rikiya\u2019s head, passing him into Kacchan\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlrighty, Kacchan. Be good for Daddy, okay, Rikiya? You, too, Mikio. Love you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t! Love you, Daddy!\u201d Rikiya promises.</p>\n<p>\"Me neither! Bye!\" Mikio says immediately after. These kids; Izuku swears they're exactly like Kacchan was.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Kacchan says, and points to Ms. Kiryu with narrowed eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t corrupt my husband anymore. He doesn\u2019t need any of that extra shit in the cart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu sniffs the air, turning her nose up and away from Kacchan. \u201cI will do whatever I please, Mr. Dynamight, including spoiling this lovely man as he deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDaaad,\u201d Mikio whines, and tries to shake Kacchan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI gotta gooo.\u201d He starts to repeatedly bang his forehead against the back of Kacchan's head, the dull thunking noise painfully audible.</p>\n<p>Rikiya starts patting Kacchan\u2019s cheek from where he\u2019s carefully settled against Kacchan\u2019s side and away from Saki.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, Mikio\u2019s gonna pee on you,\" he helpfully informs Kacchan, in case Kacchan didn't understand Mikio's attempt at thought osmosis via skull bashing. He keeps patting Kacchan\u2019s cheek to a rhythm only he understands, and Mikio syncs the beat of his kicking legs and head bonking to it.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu grabs Izuku\u2019s arm again, settling her hand back on his forearm, and makes a shooing motion at Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo, Mr. Dynamight. I believe you have some pressing matters to attend to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan rolls his eyes but offers her a half-smile anyways. Mikio bonks harder. \u201cQuit it with the shitty \u2018Mr. Dynamight\u2019, alright? Just call me Bakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan turns to Izuku next and steps closer to him, invading his space.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, okay, baby?\u201d he softly tells Izuku, and then Kacchan firmly kisses him before he can answer, a long, chaste press of their lips together before whipping around, marching back down the aisle absolutely covered in children (Rikiya still using Kacchan's face as a soundboard) and like a man on a mission.</p>\n<p>Well, more like a dad trying to avoid at all costs their kid peeing in public, but, still, it\u2019s the same feeling.</p>\n<p>As Izuku has learned over the years, parenting is a lot like hero work, except instead of extremely volatile criminals and perilous situations it\u2019s extremely volatile children and wildly different but no less perilous situations.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd help Ms. Kiryu with her basket, dumbass!\u201d Kacchan calls over his shoulder, hoisting Rikiya into a better position in his arms before disappearing around the corner. Mikio has resorted to gnawing on Kacchan's shoulder, and Izuku winces in sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay! Bye! I love you!\u201d Izuku calls out and he can barely hear Kacchan\u2019s muffled cursing in response.</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs under his breath, before turning back to Ms. Kiryu.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he says, and gestures to the cart. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust one more thing,\u201d Ms. Kiryu cuts in, taking lead once more. Her big bag bangs against her knees as she starts to shuffle next to him in her narwhal socks and Jesus sandals once again and Izuku finds himself oddly comforted by the sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d she asks him. Izuku doesn\u2019t even need to think about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Kiryu raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cKatsudon, eh? Sounds a little\u2026 familiar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is not blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with katsudon? It\u2019s good!\u201d he defends.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he is,\u201d she says, and laughs at Izuku\u2019s expression once more. Izuku brings his hands up to cover his steaming face, groaning beneath them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Kiryu, please, have mercy,\u201d he begs her, but Ms. Kiryu shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d she promises, and reaches for her things as they arrive at the self-checkout stations.</p>\n<p>Izuku beats her to it, grabbing her hefty basket and setting it down at her own station. He starts taking his things out in the station directly next to hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me cook for you,\u201d she tells him, taking items out of her basket and scanning them. \u201cI already gave that husband of yours my number. Let me know when you\u2019re free and bring your whole family over for dinner. Keep an old lady company, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, so <em>that\u2019s</em> what Kacchan put in his pocket earlier. Ms. Kiryu is sneakier than Izuku had expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Izuku asks, as he starts scanning his items at a fast and well-practiced pace. \u201cWe can be a lot altogether, especially the twins. Plus, Saki is still only a few months old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense, it will be fine. If I could handle Makoto at her hungriest, then I can handle you and your brood. Just come ready to eat,\u201d she orders him, and Izuku can\u2019t help but acquiesce with a smile.</p>\n<p>Makoto must have been her wife, and Izuku easily sees there\u2019s no use in arguing with Ms. Kiryu on this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, we would be glad to join you. Thank you,\u201d he says, taking out his grocery bags to pack his items.</p>\n<p>She just waves him off, grinning to herself as she finishes with the last of her things, and Izuku moves over to help her, packing her things and holding the bags for her.</p>\n<p>As Izuku walks Ms. Kiryu to the exit, she tugs him to a stop, and stares up at Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything okay, Ms. Kiryu?\u201d he asks, eyebrows furrowing in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a very lucky man, Mr. Deku.\u201d She states it simply, not specifying why exactly Izuku is so lucky, but she doesn\u2019t need to.</p>\n<p>She continues walking again, and a dopey smile crawls up Izuku\u2019s face as he follows her.</p>\n<p>He thinks about his kids, thinks about who exactly he gets to come home to, who he gets to save people with, who has been by his side his entire life, and can\u2019t help but agree with her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku says softly. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p>"
