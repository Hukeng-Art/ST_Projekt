  "text": "<p>The final nail in his coffin came when he rounded a bend, got himself tangled in a monstrous bush and came out the other side realizing he couldn\u2019t see his jeep anymore. It was time to finally admit this had been a monumentally stupid idea. He should turn around right now, while he still had a chance of finding his way back, any further and he was in real danger of getting lost out here all night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Lost. In the dark. In werewolf territory.</p>\n<p>He was a senior, he should've know better. Everyone knew Jackson Whittmore was an unwashed asshole, so Stiles couldn\u2019t <em>believe </em>he\u2019d caved to that guy\u2019s peer pressure bullshit. Something like this was bound to happen if he showed up at the guy\u2019s house. But getting an invite to the party had been a miracle in the first place, and there had been a lot of something sweet and deadly finding its way down his throat in the beginning, enough to make him feel like he was safe. Like the fact that there were hundreds of his school mates packed into this house, lights down and music cranked, meant that Jackson would be too busy to notice Stiles\u2019 wobbly baby foal attempt to chat up his girl.</p>\n<p>He noticed. Stiles braced for a fist to the gut, but instead got an arm looped around his shoulder when he tried to slide away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should send Little Red!\u201d Jackson, reeking of sour-cheap beer, breathed right into his face.</p>\n<p>Full moon out, and the jocks had been howling and jumping on the furniture all night and <em>why why why</em> had he worn this stupid red hoodie?</p>\n<p>But then Lydia was actually making eye contact with him while Jackson goaded him on, arching her brow as if Stiles might do something that could hold her attention for more time than it took to flip her perfect strawberry hair.</p>\n<p>None of his excuses worked, and he should have just run out of there full tilt because there was nothing that sent up a red flag faster than Jackson in a good mood, acting <em>nice</em>. All the other jocks circled and cheered.</p>\n<p>And of course Scott was nowhere to be found because, Allison.</p>\n<p>So, predictably, cut to Stiles, in the middle of the night, stumbling through - <em>trespassing </em>through - the very clearly marked border between the county of Beacon Hills and the Hale property with its \u201cDo Not Enter: Werewolf Territory\u201d signs everywhere, the black wolf head with red eyes on a yellow background staring at him as Stiles pulled his hood over his head and hurried on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He wondered how much farther the house was. Not too far, he imagined. When the Hales had lived there, they\u2019d come into town now and then; some people liked to brag that they\u2019d been friends with a few of them. But no one had ever been <em>on </em>their land but the Sheriff and a few of his deputies because the town charter had always been very clear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Humans couldn\u2019t expect any legal protection if they tried to cross the border.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThat place has been abandoned for years, should be a piece of cake, right Stilinski?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou fucking <em>do this</em> man! You\u2019ll be a legend! Stilin-<em>ski!</em> Stilin-<em>ski!</em> Stilin-<em>ski!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Right, Jackson, sure, no problem. Just walk up to the spooky abandoned mansion in the middle of the woods, pry off the door knocker as a trophy and make it back without getting murdered then eaten by the mutated zombie wolf rumored to be out here. Or was it a ghost wolf bent on vengeance? Whatever, point was, everybody knew you didn\u2019t fucking go into these woods in the daylight with police backup which was why, of course, Stiles was out here alone in the dark with a flashlight that was slowly dying on him.</p>\n<p>His heart felt like it was going to pound its way out of his chest. He smacked the side of the light and it flared for another few seconds before dimming again. The trees hoarded most of the natural the light, but it was bright enough under the full moon that he could see just \u00a0enough to know he was officially completely lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Stiles cursed under his breath, quickening his pace because if he could still find the house, maybe he could find the remains of the road they used to use years ago.</p>\n<p>He was not going to think about werewolves. He was not going to let his mind wander at every little rustle and snapping twig. There were a lot of other animals out here, it was a preserve for shit sake. Deer and racoons and\u2026.and\u2026.</p>\n<p>He heard the growl before he saw the eyes. Red eyes, low to the ground and watching him from the trees.</p>\n<p>Stiles ran.</p>\n<p>And goddamnit, it was like he hadn\u2019t spent huge chunks of time online researching every little thing he could find about werewolves. Hadn\u2019t gone to all the websites, wolf and human, even the trashy ones that dealt in smut glazed rumor. Even porn. (Especially porn) And they all knew that rule number one was if a werewolf\u2019s locked onto you\u2026.do not fucking run.</p>\n<p>But he couldn\u2019t help it, his heart was going to explode and the adrenaline just took over his body before his mind could object. He heard a howl behind him, chilling, gleeful. Careening through the trees, branches tearing at his clothes, snagging his hood until he lost his footing. The ground was covered in soft, dry leaves and they made so much fucking noise as he scrambled back to his feet and flew off deeper into the woods.</p>\n<p>He could hear the wolf chasing, smell his own sweat and taste a drop of blood on his lip. The werewolf jumped out from his left and Stiles screamed, cutting right and somehow making it. He tore down a gully and up over a log and the wolf swiped at him from behind a tree. Stiles jerked back and veered through a space where the branches began to thin. Twice more he dodged just in time, lungs burning, legs numb. The thing behind him was yipping, grunting, but not catching up.</p>\n<p>Stiles almost stumbled in surprise. It definitely should have caught him by now, werewolves were faster, stronger. Alphas doubly so, and red eyes meant this thing was an Alpha.</p>\n<p>It was playing with him.</p>\n<p>Stiles slowed his pace just a little, unable to help himself from turning to look. And that\u2019s when it pounced.</p>\n<p>The two bodies went down in graceless barrel rolls before Stiles found himself pinned by a heavy mass, clawed hands holding down his wrists and knees bracketing his hips in place. Instinctively he turned his head, squeezed his eyes shut so he wouldn\u2019t have to actually see the teeth when they sank into his throat.</p>\n<p>But nothing happened. And Stiles opened one eye to figure out why.</p>\n<p>He was prepared for the sight of a Beta shifted face, in fact, he was grateful for it because he would have been seriously shit out of luck if this thing was in its Alpha form. What he wasn\u2019t expecting was for the guy to scent him quickly in the neck, roll off his body and then shift back into human, still squatting on all fours two feet away.</p>\n<p>Mostly human, he still had the teeth and the claws, but his eyes were some kind of pale hybrid color he couldn\u2019t quite pick out and Stiles was struck dumb by the discovery that the man was seriously, reality-alteringly gorgeous.</p>\n<p>And naked.</p>\n<p>Gorgeous and naked and <em>huge</em>.</p>\n<p>Streaked in dirt, sweat matting the hair on his chest and thighs, boulder-thick muscles rolling under his skin as he shifted left and right, watching Stiles with something more akin to curiosity than aggression. Which was a blessing because even curled on his haunches Stiles could tell the man would dwarf him if he unfolded to his full height.</p>\n<p>A true Alpha wolf.</p>\n<p>God, if he had an ounce of sense he would be backing away slowly. But he couldn\u2019t seem to move, because, <em>holy shit </em>when was he ever going to get a chance to be this close to a real, live half-shifted werewolf again, especially one so scorchingly hot, even with the fangs?</p>\n<p>Who was he kidding, Stiles had beaten off to stuff like this for years. He might concede he was bi in general, but when it came to the werewolf population, his dick was gay as hell. So this situation was sending his body more than a few mixed signals.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey buddy,\u201d Stiles tried for the soft lilt used with animals or small children. Werewolves were still people, just people deluxe as he liked to call them, but it <em>was </em>a full moon out and there was no telling in a situation like this if the guy might be feral or not. \u201cI just...I made a mistake and got lost and I promise I\u2019ll turn right back around and leave and you\u2019ll never see me here again. I swear. I would just really, really appreciate it if none of my body parts found their way through your digestive tract.\u201d</p>\n<p>The werewolf huffed out through his nose, turned in a circle and scented the air, then dropped his gaze back to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you\u2026.understand me big guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>And because his father was right that he didn\u2019t have the sense God gave a grapefruit, Stiles extended a hand. He knew scent was important to wolves and he hoped his communicated that he wasn\u2019t a threat. The wolf let him get close, close enough that Stiles\u2019 fingers could feel the heat pouring off the man\u2019s skin. They sat there, suspended, Stiles with his arm outstretched, just barely a foot from the werewolf\u2019s shoulder, while the guy stared flatly at him.</p>\n<p>Nothing happened. His hand remained attached to his arm.</p>\n<p>Feeling bolder, or suicidal depending on who you asked, Stiles stretched his fingers, just a little, and closed the distance. He barely got a chance to register the rasp of stubble on the man\u2019s cheek because the moment their skin connected, he found himself knocked on his back again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa whoa hey!\u201d</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s face buried itself in Stiles\u2019 neck and began huffing lungfuls of his scent, running his nose all over, trying to burrow into the collar of the hoodie and getting frustrated at the hindrance. Well, feral or not, the guy knew how to work a zipper, that was for sure. Not ripped off, but dragged delicately down to Stiles\u2019 belly between two razor edged claws, so carefully deliberate it made Stiles mouth dry and his heart fall off tempo. Peeling back the fabric, diving in, Stiles squirmed and gasped beneath him. He might have been terrified for his own life only seconds ago, but the moment the wolf began licking at him, long, savoring swipes of his tongue up and down Stiles\u2019 neck, over his collarbones and along his jaw, he was done for. His head fell back into the dirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>god</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood pooled in his groin, filling his aching cock. The wolf pulled back, sniffed around him then grumbled in approval. Oh god that\u2019s right, he could <em>smell </em>how excited Stiles just became. And <em>liked </em>it. There wasn\u2019t enough memory left in his kink drive for all the shit he was saving for later.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta be hallucinating right now. Or maybe you already killed me and this is my brain\u2019s way of dealing with the shock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two strong, claw tipped hands encircled his hips and yanked Stiles\u2019 lower half up so that his groin was lifted right up into the guy\u2019s face. The werewolf breathed him in, rubbing his cheeks over the hard line of Stiles\u2019 erection until he thought he would burst, arms flailing out uselessly, trying to find something to hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hey, wait! I don\u2019t know what you--\u201d</p>\n<p>The distinctive sound of his jeans being torn open at the waistband was jarring in the open-air hush of the woods. His fear flashed back instantly and it all came crashing down on him that he had no earthly way of protecting himself from this creature.</p>\n<p>The were had managed to shred his pants and boxers enough that he could shove them down to Stiles\u2019 ankles, but the moment Stiles began to panic, he stopped, looked up at him again with that strangely curious expression and whined. He lowered Stiles hips back to the ground and crept back a few paces, scenting the air. He stayed there, just beyond reach while Stiles stared at the forest ceiling and caught his breath, eventually turning to look at the werewolf when his whimpering grew fractionally louder. He looked confused and\u2026..contrite? Could that term even be applied to a feral Alpha? His heartbeat calmed. On instinct, Stiles stretched out his arm along the carpet of leaves and earth, uncoiled his fingers to brush at the bolt of one broad knuckle. Dipping his head, the werewolf scented carefully at Stiles\u2019 hand, head snaking as he gradually followed the trail up his arm until he\u2019d slunk his way back to Stiles\u2019 side. As Stiles lay there watching, fascinated, the man began to gently nuzzle at the exposed skin of Stiles\u2019 belly, running his nose and lips along the heated flesh so softly that Stiles began to relax even more, all while listening to those soft, pained whines that deflated the last of Stiles\u2019 fear. When the werewolf shifted up to his neck, nosing behind his ear and under his jaw, quiet, panting whimpers batting against him in warm breath, the arousal that had abated some came bleeding back. And when Stiles felt teeth at his neck, just enough pressure to dent the skin, he groaned and went limp, acknowledging somewhere that if he made it through this he and his sexual response center were going to have a serious talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The wolf rumbled, the vibrations going straight through his teeth and into Stiles\u2019 body, like hot needles plunging deep, expelling liquor and opiates, overriding his system. Stiles moaned and arched, rubbing his cock into the man\u2019s trim stomach, the dark whorls of hair along his unfairly perfect set of abs scritching and gripping his shaft so good. With his mouth still latched around the joint of Stiles\u2019 neck, the werewolf shook him once by the teeth, a shiver of movement only just hard enough to feel possessive.</p>\n<p>Then the man released him abruptly, sat up on his knees and hoisted Stiles\u2019 hips straight up into the air at inhuman speed. Stiles\u2019 knees folded into his chest, legs dangling awkwardly, the bunched up fabric of his pants hitting him in the face. The werewolf held him practically upside down like he weighed nothing, his ass completely exposed, and he didn\u2019t even get a chance to fill his lungs with air before there was a long, hot tongue dragging up the cleft of his ass, circling the rim and corkscrewing into his tight, virgin hole.</p>\n<p>\u201cOH! <em>Ahh ha- hah</em>- Jesus fuck there\u2019s a- nnghhaaAAHH! \u00a0You have your tongue in my asshole, Sir! <em>Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The wolf was steadily devouring him, lapping roughly at the sensitive skin, sucking the pink bud, drilling his tongue hard and deep, scooping the slick walls inside before mouthing wet and sloppy like he was starving for it. And Stiles had never felt anything so amazing in his life.</p>\n<p>And the sounds above him, hungry, animal grunts, it was doing things for Stiles that were so very, very wrong. God he couldn\u2019t believe how filthy, how unashamed this guy was in his enthusiasm, as if Stiles was the only thing that could satisfy him. It occurred to him, in an out of body sort of way, that he was currently screaming, writhing, trying to shove back to get more like a desperate whore. Fuck he\u2019d never done <em>anything </em>before, never even been kissed and here he was half stripped on the forest floor while a werewolf feasted on his ass. Strong hands kneaded the globes of his buttocks, held him open and in place, making Stiles take it.</p>\n<p>And that was what did him in. Almost without warning Stiles came violently, clawing at the dirt, wailing and seizing up and the wolf didn\u2019t slow down one bit. Too sensitive, Stiles twisted and whimpered, come running up his chest, slithering around his neck, and that tongue just tasted and took until he sobbed from the glut of pleasure. Every tastebud felt huge against his twitching skin, the thick, wet muscle stabbing deeper, working his loosening rim open.</p>\n<p>Then it stopped, and he found himself flipped belly down, listening to the distinctive sound of skin on skin, rapid and desperate. Warm stripes of come painted Stiles\u2019 ass as the wolf howled. More and more and more, dripping between his cheeks and down his balls, sticky and copious and god he fucking <em>liked </em>it. He liked the dirty wet feel of getting covered in so much come.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026..so\u2026.I mean wow you were-- wait, what - what are you doing?!\u201d</p>\n<p>What he was doing was rubbing it in, pinning Stiles down by the small of his back while he massaged the come into his skin, coating his balls, kneading them with surprisingly gentle hands, wiping it across his back and every inch of his ass while Stiles squirmed and moaned then squeaked when he was flipped over again. He was given the same treatment with his own come across his belly. He made a face at the streaks of dirt he could see mixed with his spunk, the feeling of the werewolf\u2019s saliva cooling as it dripped from his hole.</p>\n<p>In the dark, the Alpha\u2019s eyes glowed red.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDude, you alive? I looked for you last night but couldn\u2019t find you!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles trudged up the stairs and into his room, almost dropping the phone when he got a look at himself in the mirror. He was still holding his ruined jeans around his waist with one hand, the other holding his cell to his ear. His favorite red hoodie was a complete mess, stretched out and covered in filth. He had a branch with a tiny pinecone bud in his hair. His neck was covered in purple marks and beard burn, and he knew his ass probably looked about the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou looked for me, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWeeeelll\u2026\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean you took your eyes off Allison\u2019s breasts for one point four seconds to scan the room before leaving for her place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI thought you were having fun! Anyway, I\u2019m outside, I\u2019ll be up in a sec, I got something amazing I gotta tell you!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBet I can beat you.\u201d Stiles muttered at the disconnected line.</p>\n<p>Stiles was just pulling out clean clothes when Scott barged into his room.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe <em>said </em>it, Stiles! She-- holy shit what happened to you?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened is you <em>left </em>me and I got talked into sneaking onto the Hale property like some <em>very special episode</em> punk. Oh yeah, and I met my first werewolf. Pretty sure it was feral.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s eyes went huge and Stiles rolled his in return. \u201cOh my god, what happened? Did it hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he chased me through the woods, tackled me to the ground\u2026..and then rimmed me blind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOH MY\u2026..wait. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA werewolf. Tongue-fucked my asshole. Until I came so hard I went blind. I\u2019m blind now. I can\u2019t see you.\u201d Stiles rubbed a hand over his face and noticed in the mirror he\u2019d only smeared more dirt on himself. Scott looked on horrified. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about what kind of person it makes me that I liked it. Like, really, <em>really </em>liked it.\u201d Scott scrunched up his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dude</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s gonna be a major let down if I ever have a normal, vanilla sexual experience after this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut are you ok? Cause that sounds\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, cause you know what\u2019s weird? He was all wolfed out and scary for a minute there, but then I got freaked, and he backed off. Like, tried to...comfort me? I don\u2019t know how to explain it, and I just\u2026..you know what, I\u2019m gonna take a shower. Then you can tell me your big news. I have ten bucks on you guys dropping the L word on each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiled to himself as Scott squawked in disbelief at his best friend ruining his big surprise. He shut the bathroom door, stared at it a moment before locking it. Turning on the shower, Stiles undressed himself and took a hard look in the mirror. Besides being disheveled, he could see the dried streaks of come on his stomach and across his hips, feel the tight, itchy pull of it and smell the rich, fecund scent of the wolf\u2019s spunk and his own sweat mingling on his skin. It should be disgusting, he\u2019d kind of always imagined his first sexual experience to involve more perfume and vanilla lip gloss rubbing off on him, but the <em>maleness </em>of it, the primal animal tang filled his nose and made his cock thicken.</p>\n<p>There was a significant bruise on his neck, a single purpling mark stitched with neat little dents. Stiles ran a finger over it, remembered the way the werewolf had gripped him in his teeth like he owned Stiles. He pressed two fingers into the mark, groaning at the way the pain tinted ache ran down his spine, stiffening his dick further until he was panting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ok in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles jumped, heartbeat jittering with guilt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, all good!\u201d</p>\n<p>He jumped into the shower, letting the hot spray run over him.</p>\n<p>After the wolf had finished shellacking him with come, the guy had dropped belly down on top of Stiles, asleep and snoring right against his face almost instantly. Stiles had hummed and poked him in the ribs, but when he wouldn\u2019t wake, Stiles actively tried to roll the guy off him, only to discover that he was woefully unprepared to bench press two hundred pounds of naked wolf-man off his chest. He\u2019d woken up at dawn, clumsily redressed, lying next to his jeep. He must have been carried there in his sleep, which had struck him as a weirdly nice gesture.</p>\n<p>Rubbing the soap over his arms and belly, Stiles moved around to his ass and felt the odd slip-slickness of so much come as it was rinsed away. He dared a pass between his cheeks, finger brushing against his hole, gasping at how sensitive it felt. It didn\u2019t feel swollen, just tender, the nerves alight at the tiniest pressure. A raw feeling sting lit up his backside, beard burn, he realized. A <em>man </em>had done this, not some other skinny teen fumbling with him in a parent\u2019s basement. And not just a man, and Alpha werewolf. With that thought on point, Stiles slid one soapy finger smoothly inside himself, biting back a curse at the sudden jolt of pleasure. The angle was off, but he managed to work it in enough of a rhythm that it didn\u2019t take more than a few strokes to his dick before he was choking back a stuttered cry, the memory of sharp teeth and beautiful green eyes following him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBillinski! What the hell\u2019d you do to your locker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles skidded around the corner, Scott on his heels. What was left of his gym locker door hung by one remaining screw, the metal crumpled like a piece of paper. Most of his lacrosse gear was strewn about the floor along with his gym bag that someone or something had torn open. His elbow pads looked like they\u2019d been put through a paper shredder, his uniform, however, was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, as a teacher I\u2019ve gotta tell you that we have an excellent drug counseling program and that steroids are not the answer, but as your coach I\u2019d ask you to share any extra with Greenberg. That kid couldn\u2019t lift a barbell with a forklift.\u201d</p>\n<p>Benched for practice, Stiles glared at his teammates, trying to figure out which of them could have pulled this stunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Little Red, I knew you\u2019d chicken out last night. Did you actually make it all the way to the Preserve in that piece of shit car of yours before turning around or did you just run straight home like a little bitch?\u201d Jackson sneered at him as he made a pass by the bleachers. Why was he even bothering looking at his other classmates? Jackson was the only one douchey enough to pull a stunt like destroying his locker.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the fuck did you put my uniform you asshat?\u201d Stiles got right up into Jackson\u2019s space, not really taking into consideration the fact that the guy was decked out in full protective gear, and therefore, had the advantage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about you spaz? I didn\u2019t touch your fucking uniform.\u201d Jackson checked him with his chest, and Stiles fell back against the bench, popping right back up and shoving Jackson in the shoulder as hard as he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey hey yo boys! Break it up!\u201d Coach Finstock yanked them apart by the collars. \u201cWittmore, get back in the lineup. Billinski, go walk it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles growled and turned hard on his heel, stalking off to the perimeter of the field, trying to put as much space between him and Jackson as he could.</p>\n<p>He was just about to make a lap, when something wrapped around his arm and hauled him into the trees.</p>\n<p>Stiles was whipped around and slammed into the nearest tree trunk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the shhh-<em>yyyooohmygod!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Looming a full head taller, the bulk of his body seeming to surround Stiles\u2019 slim figure, the werewolf had him pinned, fisting his shirt while his other hand ran up Stiles\u2019 side, scenting the air a foot from his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hey buddy,\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice shook. Sweet baby Moses, the guy was\u2026.<em>mostly </em>\u00a0human this time, red eyes the only hint otherwise, but still very much naked. He was <em>covered </em>in dirt but instead of looking disgusting, it just made him look like an unrealistically hot coal miner, like his black smudged face and grimy muscles should be scowling out from a cologne ad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026.uuhhh\u2026.listen, I don\u2019t know - <em>no no no</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles struggled to keep his shirt where it was, but the wolf was determined to have it otherwise, shoving the fabric up to Stiles\u2019 armpits and glaring at him like he couldn\u2019t understand what Stiles was fussing about. The team was running drills only yards away, he could hear them shouting, the whistle blowing, someone laughing, but that was also the moment when the werewolf\u2019s mouth found his nipple and all sound sort of went offline for a few seconds after that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>gah- fuck!</em> That\u2019s so good...mmmhhHH...no wait! There\u2019s people that-- holy shit <em>yeah like that</em>!\u201d Stiles had a grip on the wolf\u2019s hair, hanging on for dear life as the man mouthed and sucked at his chest, bringing his nipples to tight, electric peaks that had him whining and arching off the rough bark of the tree. The wolf rumbled deep in his chest, nuzzled at Stiles\u2019 neck and lapped at the mark he\u2019d left there. Stiles couldn\u2019t help it, his hands traveled down without waiting for permission and wrapped around the wolf\u2019s erection that was currently stabbing him in the hip. So hot. Molten steel-hard cock he needed both hands to manage.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuh- motherfucking...oh my god you\u2019re so huge! I couldn\u2019t see last night but that\u2019s - jeez you\u2019re a beast. I want to break my jaw on this thing. And you get a knot, don\u2019t you?\u201d He jacked his hands slowly and the man growled and snapped his hips in, knocking Stiles back as well, into the tree. \u201cYeah you do, big fat knot on your fat Alpha dick. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>But at that, the guy pulled away, and Stiles thought maybe he\u2019d done something wrong judging from the look on his face. Frustrated and a little upset. He began to whine, softly, and Stiles reached out to cup his hand around the wolf\u2019s cheek. The stubble there scratched against his palm and sent tiny frissons of pleasure up the sensitive nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeh-rek.\u201d the werewolf grit, as if this one word were too heavy to push out. He shoved his face fully into Stiles\u2019 hand and nuzzled there before looking up at him through those exquisite black lashes, willing him to understand. It took a few shocked seconds, but Stiles got there.</p>\n<p>His smile made his cheeks hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d he exhaled back. And the werewolf - Derek - dropped immediately to his knees, working open the fly of Stiles\u2019 jeans in record time and shoving his hands inside to cradle his slim hips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stiles</em>.\u201d He breathed out against the dark thatch of curls as if relieved of some terrible burden.</p>\n<p>Then dove straight in and deepthroated Stiles\u2019 cock in one go.</p>\n<p>\u201cShii-iiit!\u201d Stiles arched back as if electrocuted, shoving his own wrist in his mouth to muffle his voice and looking in panic over his shoulder, fully expecting the entire lacrosse team to be standing there. Derek secured his hips against the tree trunk with wide, warm hands and sucked and <em>sucked </em>and god his mouth was so strong\u2026...<em>so\u2026</em>.<em>strong</em>. Stiles might\u2019ve been concerned he was about to get his balls sucked right out the end of his dick but he was too busy trying not to scream from the beautiful, depraved sensation of having an orgasm torn from him with such raw, single-minded determination, right out in the open where anyone could come looking for him and see\u2026</p>\n<p>He flung his arms up when it hit, gripping the rough bark above his head with white-tipped fingers as he choked on it, mouth twisted for a bigger sound than he was able to make. Choked on the liquid white fire scorching every muscle into contracting too hard as he spilled down Derek\u2019s greedy throat.</p>\n<p>He was still coming down from the high, legs weak and threatening to buckle, when he looked down at Derek, kneeling on the ground and licking his lips hungrily, smacking his mouth like he was chasing the taste. A wolf after the kill.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez.\u201d Stiles shuddered. No eighteen year old human boy was built to handle this kind of next level pornographic shit. But his crash course wasn\u2019t done yet apparently, and he was expected to hang on for the ride, because the next thing he knew, Derek spun him easily, wedged him against that poor, defiled tree again and spread his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cRecovery! I need a minute to - fuckfuckfuck! Wait! It\u2019s too much! I can\u2019t- I can\u2019t- \u201c</p>\n<p>But Derek only lapped at him with a warm, firm tongue, getting him so dirty-good dripping with saliva that more than some of Stiles\u2019 feeble protests were introspective, mildly unsettled with how very much ok he was with all of this. There had to be something wrong with him.</p>\n<p>His hole throbbed, fucking <em>pulsed </em>with emptiness, the blood-rich rim already softening, already eager for what it was urged to take last night. And Stiles could only wrap his arms around the anchoring tree and sob when that tongue began to piston into him. Deep, deeper, steady and implacable, forcing him open and filling him with pleasure so good there were actual tears wetting his cheeks. He couldn\u2019t come again, not so soon, but it was building beyond that, drawing it out to some exquisite discomfort that he struggled to avoid out of instinct, but begged for more of in a tearstained voice. He had just started shaking uncontrollably when Derek stood, crowded into him and slotted the searing hot girth of his cock in the spit wetted cleft of his ass and began to rut furiously against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh damnit Derek YES!\u201d His chest and hips were getting pounded against the bark and Derek\u2019s hands had found stable purchase looped under his arms and holding his shoulders square. He could barely breath, he could barely think about staying quiet with the squelch and drag of Derek\u2019s cock hammering against him, and in some dim corner, he understood that this was the werewolf\u2019s only viable option because Stiles\u2019 hole was still too small and tight at the moment to take him. But god he wanted to, he wanted to know what it felt like to be fucked too wide to bare on the end of a giant Alpha cock. His own twitched, drooled and did it\u2019s best to rejoin the party, but it was too late, Derek was growling his name, hips seizing, coming all over his back, his ass, dripping down into his pant legs.</p>\n<p>With his face half buried in Stiles\u2019 sweaty neck, Derek ran a finger down the line of his back, dragging a trail of sticky come and drawing it down to where he wanted it. \u201cMine.\u201d he panted right as he shoved that one thick digit deep inside, removed it even as Stiles was gasping in shock.</p>\n<p>Again, \u201cMine.\u201d Again he gathered his spend and made sure it was left deep inside Stiles body. He\u2019d never get it out, he thought, no matter how much he showered.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should call someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d Stiles stared down at the bottle. Shake well, it said, so he shook. \u201cYou just dab it on and blend it in. Lydia said blending was the most important part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not about the concealer. I mean about your werewolf problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, exactly. More of a situation. Besides, who exactly do I call? Animal control? Warn them that a naked feral werewolf is roaming Beacon Hills performing special ops missions on my prostate?\u201d Scott probably didn\u2019t realize the severity of the face he was making. Horrified was a hilarious look on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could tell your dad\u2026..just saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should slap your mouth. You want me to tell my <em>dad</em>? The man who didn\u2019t even believe me the first - or second - time I told him I was gay? The gun carrying Sheriff with ready access to detailed topographical maps of Beacon Hills and an armed posse? That dad? Why don\u2019t I just call your mom and tell her about the time you and Allison got drunk and forgot the condom and then had to drive three towns over to get a pregnancy test? Should we do that too, as long as we\u2019re sharing our <em>situations </em>with our parents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s different! We\u2019re in a relationship!\u201d Scott dialed up the puppy eyes, going for the big guns with a barely quivering pout. He was good, the bastard.</p>\n<p>And Stiles got it, he did. From the outside, this probably looked bad.</p>\n<p>That very afternoon it had happened again. Coming out of school after detention, Stiles had been digging through his bag looking for his car keys, cursing the walk since he\u2019d only been ten minutes late this morning but that meant he\u2019d been stuck parking in the shitty spot all the way out by the dumpsters.</p>\n<p>His head snapped up when he heard the growl.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Now hang on! We are in a public parking lot. This is city property!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just glared at him, naked as ever but scrubbed clean this time, skulking next to his jeep and looking like he was two seconds from pouncing. Stiles edged sideways, attempting to put the jeep between them, because as much as his dick was now programmed to yell <em>Hooray </em>any time it saw a feral werewolf, there were after school activities about to let out and he did not want to be caught by the cheer squad getting pornographically mauled.</p>\n<p>Derek circled around the jeep after him, still growling.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Billinski!\u201d he heard called from the other end of the parking lot. Stiles cursed and darted away from Derek\u2019s attempt to snatch him. \u201cHey hang on a minute!\u201d</p>\n<p>Crap, Coach Finstock was shuffling through the maze of cars towards them, and Derek had now apparently noticed the man approaching, pausing to scowl, just enough time for Stiles to throw open the back door and scramble for something to cover Derek. He came up with a rumpled beach towel and raced to wrap it around Derek\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease keep this on, do you understand? I cannot explain your dick to my coach. And no growling!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looked down at the towel, untucking it with a frown. Stiles slapped his hands away and tucked it back in, the two of them fighting over it before Stiles finally just opened the passenger door and herded Derek inside right as Finstock ambled up. Derek for his part seemed suddenly taken with the smell of the jeep, distracted into sniffing it heavily.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour new uniform just came in, it\u2019s in my office so now at least you can look like part of the team when you warm that bench tonight. And here\u2019s the combo to your new locker.\u201d He handed a little card to Stiles. \u201cNothing better happen to either one of them or you\u2019re going to personally scrub out the showers after practice. And Greenberg\u2019s got back hair like a mountain gorilla. None on his legs though, have you noticed that? Kid\u2019s just made weird. Who\u2019s your friend and what the hell\u2019s his problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles turned to see Derek gripping the window frame with both hands and shooting Coach Finstock a starkly murderous, brow heavy glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! That\u2019s just my...uh...cousin. Miguel. He always looks like that, it\u2019s\u2026..cultural.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe always hang out in your car half naked?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Oh yeah, you know\u2026.Europe. It\u2019s been an adjustment. Anyway, see you at the game tonight Coach!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles ran around and jumped into the jeep, backing out of the parking lot as fast as he dared, realizing the minute he made it to open road he had no idea what the hell to do with the Alpha who was--</p>\n<p>Who was jerking off like a mad man in the front seat. \u201cDamnit Derek!\u201d He scanned the road, but there was no good place to pull over, people on the sidewalk, a friggin playground down the street. He yanked the towel over Derek\u2019s lap as best he could, but the man only tore it away a second later with the flare of the world\u2019s angriest magician, canting his hips up further as he presented his spectacle to the world. Stiles cursed but kept driving, willing himself not to take his eyes off the road, which was a cruel sort of test seeing that Derek grunted and flexed like a porn star, the swirls of hair on his chest dampening with sweat, the veins on his massive forearms bulging. And just as Stiles was about to round the corner onto a quiet street that abutted the Perserve, Derek\u2019s voice croaked with a filthy, broken sound and a geyser of come erupted all over the interior of the car. Stiles squawked and swerved off the road, yanking the jeep into park just in time to look over at Derek hosing down the dashboard, the windshield, the floor before whipping around and shooting the last heavy arcs across Stiles\u2019 lap.</p>\n<p>It was the most depraved thing Stiles had ever seen and he could not believe how hard it got his dick, even through his fury. He watched, open mouthed, as a heavy splash of come dripped down the windshield. How the hell was he supposed to drive home like this? What if his dad was off work?</p>\n<p>Not that Derek seemed concerned at all, the fucking prick. Dove right into Stiles neck and sucked another huge mark into the side that had been left unscathed yesterday, grunted in accomplishment at the sight before diving straight out the window head first and darting off into the trees.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asshole!\u201d Stiles screamed after him, then jammed his car in gear and tried not to speed.</p>\n<p>Which was how he found himself on Lydia\u2019s front steps, car hastily cleaned but lemony fresh, pointing at the twin hickies bookending his neck that his lacrosse uniform would definitely not cover.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I could think of that might know what to do about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia narrowed her eyes and thinned her lips a fraction. \u201cAre you implying I\u2019m a whore?\u201d She asked coolly.</p>\n<p>Stiles knew how to address royalty, \u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019re the paragon of feminine perfection and I can\u2019t think of anyone else who\u2019d be skilled enough to fix it so it lasts through the game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmmh,\u201d she huffed. \u201cEven though I see what you\u2019re doing, you also happen to be right. Stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>She returned five minutes later with a tube of something called Dermablend and assurances that it was strong enough to cover tattoos. Which had Stiles asking why she might need something like this in the first place, but the door was already on its way shut.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>They were murdering the other team, the score so comically uneven that Coach had actually let Scott off the bench for the second half with the idea that even if the other guys managed to score a few points off him it would be deemed an act of mercy. Scott was so excited, bless him, kept turning around to wave at Stiles and his mom and Alison and got checked hard each time he did, once from his own team because he wasn\u2019t paying attention. But he did manage to score once and Stiles almost missed it because he was too busy staring off into the black line of trees around the field and puzzling over Derek.</p>\n<p>Where was he right now? What was he doing? Had he always been out there or had something happened? Stiles wished he could talk to him. The guy currently had two usable words at his disposal, preferring to stick to his well tested pattern of grunt-manhandle-hump until they both shot off. After which he would disappear and Stiles was left trying to figure out just what the hell was going on. Regardless of what Scott said, Stiles wasn\u2019t a victim, not with how enthusiastically he\u2019d been enjoying things. In fact, the more he thought about it, the more convinced he was that Derek was his responsibility, the man had come to him in a troubling state and one way or another Stiles needed to break through.</p>\n<p>Because there were details that didn\u2019t fit, that picked at him. All three encounters had been on or around this past full moon, and at least for the first two, Derek had looked exactly like someone who had been living out in the wilderness for longer than the average camping trip. But he\u2019d been clean when he showed up beside Stiles\u2019 jeep in the school parking lot this afternoon. He smelled of soap, his breath wasn\u2019t rank like someone who\u2019d been feasting on prey animals without access to a toothbrush. Stiles was starting to wonder if the guy was even feral.</p>\n<p>That night Stiles began researching everything he could on werewolves in general, finding out quickly enough there was just too much information. So he\u2019d narrowed his focus to feral weres. There seemed to be two distinct types, Omegas who\u2019d been too long in the wild without socialization, and weres suffering from Ravening Disorder. And from what Stiles could gather, an Omega like that tended to avoid all forms of civilization and therefore would have ignored him completely in the woods that night.</p>\n<p>And if Derek was suffering from RD, Stiles wouldn\u2019t have just been hunted, he would have been torn to pieces, mostly eaten, buried, dug up and eaten again.</p>\n<p>Looking into the specific behavior Derek exhibited turned up exactly the kind of websites one might expect given the search terms he was forced to use. And he tried to stay on task, he really did. But no matter how he willed himself to ignore it, there was just too much temptation out there and way too many sites beckoning him with videos of doe eyed twinks getting stuffed by howling muscle freaks with paranormal stamina. And once he hit a vein dedicated strictly to the Little Red Riding Hood trope, it was just way too easy to click on one little link, then another...</p>\n<p>The next morning, Stiles woke with his face mashed against the keyboard still wearing his lacrosse uniform, the top half anyway, with a website he would never be able to explain to his father coming alive on his screen. Yeah, things had spiraled pretty far down the research hole last night. All of his fucking banner ads now featured hulking, half-shifted werewolves posing with the same heaving, fang heavy snarl, taglines all reading variations of <em>All the better to taste you with</em>, or <em>I\u2019ll show you how bad I am</em>.</p>\n<p>He needed a shower. And he was still no closer to figuring Derek out.</p>\n<p>A week went by, two weeks, and Derek didn\u2019t return. Stiles was jumpy early on, half expecting to get cornered every time he was outside alone and, unsurprisingly, half hard for it. When nothing happened, Stiles went looking, hiking out into the Preserve, though this time in the daylight, but still found no sign of his favorite growling nudist. He was ready to write it off as some sort of werewolf glitch, a fugue state maybe. Lydia had once suffered something like that, he remembered, it had been the talk of the school at the time. Maybe werewolves could too, though he wasn\u2019t sure how. Or maybe this was the wolfy version of a bachelor party, one last howl at the moon and now Derek was on a yacht with his gorgeous fianc\u00e9e, his friends laughing about how they\u2019d lost him for three whole days and when he came back he smelled like teenage human boy, they\u2019d never let him live it down.</p>\n<p>While that made the most sense to him, because there still was no truly plausible reason for a hot Alpha werewolf to want into his pants, Stiles couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Derek needed help. So he kept on researching. He slipped into his father\u2019s work portal in order to do a search for missing werewolves or sightings of possibly feral ones in the area but came up with nothing. The internet was still no use as far as pinpointing what might be wrong and it wasn\u2019t like he could ask another were, the Hales might have left years ago, but this was still technically their territory and as such the only place anyone in twenty miles could meet a werewolf in person was at a club outside Redding called FangSlave. His virgin ass wasn\u2019t going anywhere near that place.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so worried, maybe you should talk to Allison.\u201d Scott groused, annoyed at Stiles\u2019 continued refusal to pay attention to their game.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, smart thinking! Let\u2019s clue the nutjob anti-wolf evangelists in on the fact that Derek\u2019s out there in a weakened state. Maybe she\u2019s got a cousin that can show her how to craft a necklace out of his claws.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Allison\u2019s not like that! Her family only assists the police with werewolves that commit crimes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean like her Aunt, the psychotic currently locked up in supermax?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell besides her\u2026..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr her incarcerated grandfather? Or her incarcerated <em>mom</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Scott got that dazed look when <em>facts </em>showed up and started knocking over his chairs. \u201cI always sort of forget that she has a mom. It\u2019s only been her and her dad for so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh\u2026.nope. It\u2019s been her and her dad for as long as you\u2019ve been <em>dating </em>her. Her family\u2019s crazy bomb didn\u2019t go off that long ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, I just don\u2019t know why you even care. He\u2019s gone dude, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>The month was nearly out the next time he encountered Derek.</p>\n<p>Encountered was much too conversational a word, Stiles mused. One encountered a charming bookshop or a snarl in traffic due to an unexpected street fair. Was there a word that meant terror-stabbed? Lanced right through the heart with white hot fear by the set of glowing red eyes and glistening fangs hulking in the darkest corner of one\u2019s bedroom? If it existed, he was too terror-stabbed to think of it right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSon are you ok?\u201d his dad called from downstairs at the sound of Stiles screaming and promptly somersaulting backwards with the shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019m good, just a- uh- really big spider in here!\u201d He whacked the wall twice for good measure. \u201cGot it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek pushed out of the shadows. His fangs receded but his eyes stayed red. He was wearing clothes, jeans with muddy brown bloodstains, the remains of a black cotton tshirt that hung from his broad shoulders in tatters, but they were still clothes. That was harder to reconcile than the fact that he was in Stiles\u2019 room. From his back pocket, Derek took something and held it out to Stiles, and for a second time that night, Stiles was clutched with fear.</p>\n<p>A knife. A nasty looking thing with curved teeth and a strange black substance smeared over the keen edge. God he was going to die, this was some elaborate killing ritual and Derek was\u2014</p>\n<p>Derek fell to his knees in front of Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cKill\u2026\u2026me.\u201d He grit out, extending the knife in offering. Stiles\u2019 eyes were saucers, he shook his head violently back and forth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, what?! What the hell are you doing, I can\u2019t kill you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan-\u201c Derek slapped the handle into Stiles\u2019 palm and closed his fingers around it. With a clawed hand he tore the remains of his shirt from his body and pointed the tip over his heart. \u201cWolfsbane. <em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you\u2026.I tried\u2026..my wolf won\u2019t\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Stiles, buddy?\u201d The Sheriff knocked on the door. Derek was instantly on alert, the knife forgotten on the carpet as he got to his feet in a flash, clutching Stiles to him and growling. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, you mind turning that movie down you\u2019re watching?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure dad!\u201d Stiles called out as he wrestled to keep his hand over Derek\u2019s mouth to quiet him. He waited until he was sure his father\u2019s bedroom door was closed before hissing at Derek. \u201cSo I notice you can talk. Mind working out a full sentence telling me what the hell is going on? Who are you? What\u2019s happened to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a long while, Derek only seemed capable of breathing heavily through his nose. Stiles watched him, patient, still held close against the overheated mountain of shoulders and abs and wide, furred chest. He didn\u2019t try to move away, and the decision seemed to calm Derek in steady increments.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t make it\u2026\u2026stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake what stop?\u201d Stiles prodded when that appeared to be all Derek was willing to give.</p>\n<p>Derek pulled Stiles in tighter, snuffled at his neck and collarbone and let out the most pitiful, wounded sound imaginable before forcefully letting go. He scooped up the knife and pressed it into Stiles\u2019 hand, his eyes a beautiful, clear green.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep this. And if you have to, use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that he dove through the open window into the night.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until later, when he\u2019d been lying awake in bed from a brain that won\u2019t shut off, that Stiles realizes that in the moment before he\u2019d fled, he had gotten a glimpse of the man beneath the beast.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like Beacon Hills was a total hick town. Not like everyone knew everyone else, but it was small enough that on the second day Stiles came to the realization that the sleek black Camero he\u2019s been seeing around is defiantly new. And it\u2019s definitely following him. At first it\u2019s just at the fringes, driving round the block at his school, drifting through the parking lot when he\u2019s out getting groceries. But then it\u2019s in his rear view mirror and matching his speed. Stiles knows his dad isn\u2019t home, so he heads to Scott\u2019s. Just as he\u2019s stepping out of the car, the Camero slows, the dark tinted window rolling down, allowing Stiles the first real glimpse inside. The girl driving is much younger than he expected, with a dark expression that pings off as familiar to Stiles in some way. There\u2019s no mistaking the way she leans over the passenger seat and sniffs the air. <em>Werewolf</em>, Stiles thinks, turning tail and hurrying inside the house. <em>Just what I need</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost forgotten her hours later when he finally heads home. The jeep engine clicked as it cooled while Stiles digs for his keys.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kid!\u201d The girl stalked down the sidewalk towards him. The Camero is nowhere to be seen, the foresight that implies not making Stiles feel all that inclined to chat with her. Or maybe it\u2019s the strained smile she\u2019s doing her best to hold into place, a look of forced easiness that seems entirely unnatural to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cKid?\u201d Stiles is a much better hand at pretending everything\u2019s cool. \u201cI\u2019m probably older than you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d She shrugged, kept walking. Stiles tried not to fumble with his keys. \u201cOld habit. Look, I\u2019m kinda new in town and I though this place was free of weres but it looks like I was wrong. Caught scent of one but I can\u2019t seem to find them, every trail leads me to you. I don\u2019t want to break any rules here, so if you could point me in the right direction so I can make a formal introduction, that\u2019d be great. You know, werewolf manners and all.\u201d She\u2019d stopped halfway up his walk, but Stiles was under no illusion that the meager distance made him safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not friends with any weres.\u201d Which isn\u2019t a lie. Whatever he and Derek are, it\u2019s too convoluted to be called friends.</p>\n<p>Her fa\u00e7ade cracked, and the pure, uncut malice there made him scared in a way Derek never did. \u201cWhere is he.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks about the wolfsbane knife, uselessly shut up in his bedside drawer. He thinks about Derek, alone and suffering out there somewhere. \u201cHe? Listen, I don\u2019t know what you-\u201c</p>\n<p>She\u2019s got him pinned to the front door with terrifying speed, eyes glowing gold, claws inches from his throat. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. I can smell him all over you. You cannot fucking <em>imagine</em> the trouble you\u2019ll be in for if you don\u2019t tell me where to find him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snarled when she heard the truth in his heartbeat, turned and stomped back the way she came without so much as a parting threat. Stiles assumed it was implied.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>When Stiles woke that same night, he didn\u2019t startle at the red eyes at the foot of his bed, he\u2019d almost expected it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles sighed, still half asleep. It was all the invitation needed. Derek was on him, pawing at the covers so he could get his hands on Stiles\u2019 sleep clothes, shoving them off to rub himself all over Stiles bare skin, inhumanly deep grumbles making Stiles\u2019 whole body sing. Stiles groaned, Derek was already naked, and the feel of his fever hot skin was threatening to override his brain. He wriggled back an inch, cupped the sides of Derek\u2019s head and maneuvered him until their eyes connected.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, buddy, you with me? Derek\u2026.DEREK!\u201d The red flickered and faded, splintered green irises sharpening with awareness under a hard-drawn brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo- sorry- \u201c He managed to cough, head collapsing onto Stiles\u2019 chest. \u201cGet- knife-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing that again, ok? I\u2019m not murdering you in my bedroom.\u201d He pet at Derek\u2019s heaving sides as the man trembled on top of him, his control palpably tenuous. \u201cYou\u2019re heavy as shit and I\u2019d probably suffocate under you before I managed to push you off. And the blood? I\u2019d have to throw out this mattress and you can\u2019t imagine the kind of hell I had to go through to convince my dad to spring for memory foam. Besides, do you know what that would do to the resale value of this house? I-\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek growled, but with an edge of frustration rather than anger. It was a good sign, Stiles made most people crazy with his unfocused chatter. It meant Derek still had some of his wits about him. \u201cI want to help you, but you have to tell me what\u2019s wrong. Can you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u2026useless\u2026..\u201d Derek shook his head, buried his nose in the soft skin of Stiles\u2019 armpit, fitting his teeth down the rungs of his ribcage one after the other.</p>\n<p>Stiles wasn\u2019t sure if Derek meant it was useless to try to help, or if Derek himself was useless. Either way, he deserved a gold medal for the amount of control he dredged up to resist the suffocating allure of having the man rutting against him and memorizing his proportions with the flat of his tongue. Solid gold, none of that plated crap.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, wait, there\u2019s\u2026.<em>fuckinggoddamnit</em> <em>you\u2019re good</em>- ah <em>ah</em>- shit, there\u2019s someone looking for you! Derek!\u201d</p>\n<p>And the response was so soft, hindered by the delicate spot just above the crest of his hip, that Stiles almost didn\u2019t hear it. \u201cLet them come\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was as far as Derek could hold out. Stiles tried his best to get the werewolf to tell him who they were, why they were after him, what exactly he could do to help pull Derek from the state he was in, but Derek only flipped Stiles on his belly, licked and sucked and bit his skin red until he spread both cheeks and once again sated himself on pure taste of the panting boy beneath him. When his hands wandered, when his intention became clear, Stiles managed, with some difficulty, to fish a bottle of lube from his nightstand, awkwardly twisting his arm behind him to squirt a messy stream right down the crack of his ass. At the feel of the slickness beneath the pads of his fingers, Derek growled, pleased, and wasted no time pushing one thick finger deep into Stiles, another one following soon after. Stiles lost his breath at the rhythm, ready for pain, the sharp burn of being stretched so quickly, but there was none. Nothing but warm, delicious fullness that very quickly wasn\u2019t enough. Derek fucked him on his fingers, rutted his huge cock on the soft, lube slick space between Stiles\u2019 thighs, grunting, screwing a third finger in and going right for Stiles\u2019 prostate.</p>\n<p>Stiles didn\u2019t see the red eyes, the teeth, the lines of winding black that snaked up Derek\u2019s arm as he took every hint of pain. All Stiles knew was the solid body around him, in him, the feeling that though something was wrong with Derek, this here- their bodies and breath and want that pumped their hearts in strong, deafening beats- this was right.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>Stiles woke like a man returning from the dead. Deep, inky sleep had taken him after he\u2019d come more times than should be physiologically possible.\u00a0 He was tacky with a truly objectionable amount of come and when he tried to roll over with a groan, he discovered the sleeping werewolf plastered to his back who was still three fingers deep in his ass. Had they been like this all night? Reflexively he clenched against the intrusion, ready for soreness or a bright flash of pain, but there was nothing but the pleasant, full ache. Without thinking about it, Stiles rocked back, moaning at the slightly deeper pressure. Derek was awake instantly, grumbling, snaking his other arm tighter around Stiles\u2019 midsection and taking over the slow thrust into his still slick heat. Stiles\u2019 breath skittered, eyes rolling back as he arched against the huge, determined body pinning him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cMine,\u201d Derek growled into his neck, the words barely sounding human. \u201cMy Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I- \u201c</p>\n<p>\n<em>Knock Knock</em>\n</p>\n<p>Both heads snapped up, but Derek didn\u2019t stop pistoning his fingers. If anything, he got faster. \u201c<em>My Stiles</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, son, I\u2019ve gotta head to work. Don\u2019t be late for school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Stiles yelped. \u201cYes! I\u2019m\u2014<em>oh fuck</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thank God his dad had long since become immune to Stiles flailing about in the morning.</p>\n<p>Staring out the window of his first period history class, Stiles still felt out of breath. Getting to school on time this morning had been\u2026.challenging.</p>\n<p>Derek hadn\u2019t been interested in letting him get out of bed, even less so in letting him shower. It had only been after Stiles made a break for the kitchen, frying up the entire package of bacon he kept hidden beneath the carrots, Derek mouthing at his neck the whole time, that he\u2019d gotten a few minutes to himself to get ready for school. The look of awe Derek had given him when Stiles presented him with a platter full of cured meat was almost too goddamned adorable for Stiles to handle. Without thinking, he snuck a quick kiss to Derek\u2019s head while the man demolished his food then hurried to\u00a0the bathroom. When he emerged, the bacon was gone, his laundry was strewn all over his bedroom and the window lay open, Derek nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>Stiles had leaned over the sill, looking for Derek, but instead locked eyes with the dark-haired girl, the Camero parked in his driveway with the engine still running. As she climbed out from behind the wheel, she glared at him, scented the air and snarled, dropping back down into the seat and peeling off down the street. Stiles scrambled back inside and scrawled the license plate down on a piece of scrap paper, slipping it into his pocket for later.</p>\n<p>The girl must not have caught up to Derek, because Stiles caught a glimpse of him once, as he drove past a copse of trees on his way to school. A pale figure barreling through the trees parallel to the road, glowing red eyes on him until he was forced to turn south.</p>\n<p>Allison had started using a new shampoo, or worn a new sweater, or something, because Scott was far too distracted that morning to notice anything off with his friend. That was fine, that was for the best. Scott still hadn\u2019t come around to the idea that Derek needed help, needed Stiles\u2019 help, and Stiles was honestly tired of the low thrum hostility and guilt inducing puppy eyes coming off his friend any time he brought it up.</p>\n<p>It was during second period when things went to shit.</p>\n<p>Someone\u2019s phone went off, then another. The teacher tried to reprimand them but his own text alert sounded. Someone went running down the hall. People were cursing, laughing, gasping.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, everyone settle down!\u201d Their teacher tried to regain order, but more and more people were rushing past the classroom and down the hall.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAttention students, we ask that you please stay in your classrooms. The situation is under control. Any student found outside of class will get immediate detention for a week.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The principal\u2019s voice sounded anything but calm over the intercom. Next to him, Danny\u2019s cell went off with three texts in a row.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stiles leaned over and whispered, not that he would have been heard over the commotion.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, they just found a big ass stag on the front steps of the school, throat ripped out. Nobody knows how it got there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles paled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard Jenny Tucasetto found it and fainted right on top of it! <em>Covered</em> in blood!\u201d Someone pipped up.</p>\n<p>\u201cKai went out there and said it wasn\u2019t even dead yet, still, like, twitching.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is so gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClass, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to please take your seats and quiet down. I know this is probably upsetting, but our town has a long history of mountain lions roaming this area and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to go to the nurse!\u201d Stiles\u2019 hand shot up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stillinski, don\u2019t think that you can pull anything over on me just to sneak some photos of the carnage for your Instagram.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the word carnage, he paled further. \u201cNo, I- all this talk of blood and dead\u2026.animals. I think I\u2019m gonna puke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>God</em> let him <em>go</em>!\u201d A girl in the back screeched.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait! Hold it till I can get video!\u201d Jackson laughed, whipping out his phone.</p>\n<p>And maybe it was his pallor, or maybe the fine tremor of his hands that was unlike Stiles\u2019 usual jitters, or maybe Mr. Carre just didn\u2019t like his odds of getting trapped in a room with a sick kid while the custodians were dealing with the mess out front. He gave Stiles a hall pass with as stern a warning as he could, but his attention was already being drawn away by Jackson making some of the girls scream with details of how animals devour their prey.</p>\n<p>He was running so fast down the hall, he didn\u2019t actually see her until she slammed him into the wall of lockers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have a hall pass,\u201d he wheezed.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen you little shit, you\u2019re running out of time to save your own ass. Tell me where you\u2019re keeping him and you won\u2019t have to get hurt.\u201d Her eyes flashed gold. Students were still milling about the halls, cracking jokes and shouting and completely ignoring the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere I\u2019m keeping him?\u201d Stiles laughed, he was mostly sure she couldn\u2019t kill him here with all these witnesses. Then again, with his acute lack of popularity, he wasn\u2019t sure anyone would take notice if he was lying in a pool of his own blood. \u201cUp your ass and to the left. You\u2019ll need move that stick though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so <em>fucking</em> lucky I need you alive right now otherwise I\u2019d fold you in half backwards and shove you in this locker!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Derek would like that very much.\u201d It was probably stupid to try and use Derek as a threat seeing as he had no concrete evidence how the werewolf would feel about it one way or another.</p>\n<p>But it also worked.</p>\n<p>The girl dropped her hands from his shirt like he was on fire, backing away with a look of pure, impotent rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cPray,\u201d She snarled, trying to hold back her fangs. \u201c<em>Pray</em> I find him soon, or I\u2019m coming back to use your ass as bait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slipped out the side door the moment she was gone, listened to the sound of the Camero\u2019s engine as it sped away. He was just unlocking his car when the air split with a howl, long and booming, seeming to come from everywhere at once. Everything went still, the whole world holding its breath at the sound of an Alpha announcing his presence. A car alarm went off several blocks away. Someone in one of the classrooms behind him howled back in a cracking, pubescent voice. Stiles didn\u2019t waste any more time.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought about looking for Derek in the Preserve, maybe corralling him back home or something, but the likely outcome of that scenario was getting pinned to the ground- again- \u00a0and ravaged again like he was the heroine of a bad romance novel. Again. Besides, Derek was fully aware of where he lived now and hadn\u2019t shown any difficulties letting himself in when it suited him. No, his best course of action was to find out what he could about this girl. Because no matter how good a job Derek had been doing avoiding her before, he\u2019d all but dropped a spotlight on his location for any wolf in a ten-mile radius with that howl.</p>\n<p>One of the good things about living in a small town? All the police functions were merged onto one system. Not like in a big city where every department had its own siloed network. Nope, if you had the passcodes, then you could access everything.</p>\n<p>And Stiles had had the passcodes since he was thirteen.</p>\n<p>He got a hit on the Camero almost immediately, an old speeding ticket from almost two years back. But he wasn\u2019t expecting the name on the registration. Or the photo on the matching license when he looked that up to confirm.</p>\n<p>Derek Hale.</p>\n<p>His wolf. Only the license stated he was a Beta, so he must have come into his status fairly recently. And right there beneath it, as required by law, his Alpha, Talia Hale. Former Alpha now, packs never had more than one, though families like the Hales, old lineages with prolific numbers, remained close allies with the packs that inevitable budded off when a new Alpha emerged from their ranks. When people talked about the Hales, it wasn\u2019t just the large family headed by Talia that had moved off this land to God knows where, it was the vast network of Hale packs that held claim to a healthy majority of northern California.</p>\n<p>If they\u2019d met under different circumstances in Beacon Hills, Stiles would have just assumed Derek was a Hale. But loaners, Omegas, rarely were. What the hell had happened to him? Had they abandoned Derek after he\u2019d become an Alpha? That wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever heard before, but maybe being an Alpha and feral had been cause for banishment? And what about this girl driving around town in Derek\u2019s car? There was nothing about her that Stiles could find, no name, no photos, nothing.</p>\n<p>Stiles kept digging. He focused on the Hales themselves. There was less than he\u2019d thought in the database, but what was there had deep roots. It was nearly seven o\u2019clock when he surfaced to the sound of his father\u2019s key in the door. He shut down the website and flipped the pages of the notebook he\u2019d been steadily filling so that only his biology notes were visible. He cracked open a few school books along his desk and just managed to get his headphones on by the time his dad poked his head in.</p>\n<p>\u201cBig test coming up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles pushed the headphones back off, pretending to be engrossed in his work, hoping his dad wouldn\u2019t notice the jack wasn\u2019t actually plugged into anything. \u201cOh, yeah. Sorry, I was going to make dinner but I just have so much work, I didn\u2019t realize\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I order some take out? Chinese sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks dad.\u201d He grinned, only feeling slightly guilty. \u201cBut nothing fried!\u201d He yelled as his father headed downstairs.</p>\n<p>Opening a new notebook, Stiles combed through the splotches of chicken scratch, building out a timeline of the Hales from the time Derek was born to today. A neatly printed, bulleted list that he finished just as the doorbell rang and was forced to abandon when his father called him down to eat. It beckoned to him all throughout dinner. He couldn\u2019t make it back to his room fast enough, scooping up his notes and settling in to read them still chewing a mouthful of garlic string beans.</p>\n<p>Derek Hale was born the second child of Talia and Michael Hale. He had four other siblings, all of which were still registered as Betas of Talia Hale. Derek and his oldest sister Laura had both attended Beacon Hills High School, in fact they\u2019d been the last werewolf students to ever attend there.</p>\n<p>Charges of harassment filed by the Hales against an unnamed party, the records sealed after a settlement.</p>\n<p>Charges of public disturbance, stalking, coercion of a minor, assault with a deadly weapon, attempted arson, attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, assaulting a police officer, all named against one individual. Kate Argent. The details are sealed, there wasn\u2019t a trial. Kate Argent was sent to a maximum security psychiatric ward with very little legal resistance. This isn\u2019t much of a surprise, local gossip had hinted at something like this for years.</p>\n<p>Six months later, the Hale property is signed over to the care of their registered Emissary. Stiles pulled up short when he recognized the name. Deaton? The vet Scott had been working for the last few months? He\u2019d met the guy a few times, but Scott had never told him the guy was a Hale Emissary. And Scott experienced physical pain if he didn\u2019t tell Stiles every single detail of his life.</p>\n<p>Then there was nothing for years, no hint of the Hales or where they\u2019d gone, until that speeding ticket in Derek\u2019s name issued from a precinct three counties over. A year goes by, and the Hale property is signed over to Derek. Construction permits are issued for the house and surrounding lands in Derek\u2019s name. Then four months ago, Talia Hale is given power of attorney over Derek\u2019s estate, which is odd because with Betas all property is automatically reverted to their Alpha anyway. But if Derek was an Alpha by then, then any transference of rights or property should have gone to his second. Werewolf law hadn\u2019t changed much in hundreds of years, and in most cases, pack hierarchy made it simpler to sort out than human laws. There are no legal records of Derek reregistering as an Alpha. There are no details as to why Talia would need to claim power of attorney.</p>\n<p>What there is, the final thing he had found and the thing that set him most on edge, was a blanket restraining order against every Argent and known Argent associate for the entire Hale pack as of three months ago. Jesus, Stiles can\u2019t even begin to imagine the kind of money and influence it would take to pull something like that off, and if the dates were correct, in less than a week. Talia had wanted her pack protected from the only known hunters in the state and she\u2019d wanted it fast.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>\u201cHey dad, did you ever know the Hales?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles had been sitting next to his father, half watching the game, doing his best impersonation of casual while waiting for an opening to bring up the Hales. The commercial about a clothing line for werewolves that wouldn\u2019t tear no matter how much you shifted had been a perfect in. Stiles snorted at the wolves on the screen, shifting to Beta and back again with a look of surprised delight at the continued integrity of their clothing, like spandex was a strange new magic.</p>\n<p>Tear-away pants, Stiles thought. Like basketball players wore, but for regular clothing. He should write that down, that was a money-maker right there. But then he thought of high school and what might happen if students showed up in break-away clothing. And that right there was probably why it hadn\u2019t ever been invented.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want me to answer your question or\u2026..?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHales! Yes, sorry. That commercial was so stupid I think my brain shut down for a second. Did you know them, when they lived here?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad chuckled and looked back at the screen, groaning at the umpire before shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cOfficially, yeah. There were meetings a few times a year with their Alpha to go over any issues, reinstate territory boundaries and all that. Didn\u2019t really know them socially, they kept to themselves a lot but I ran into a few of them now and then. They were always friendly, but your mom used to know Talia a little better, did PTA stuff with her and always asked about the kids. They always had a ton of them running around out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles bit his lip. <em>Did you know Derek</em>, he wanted to ask, but there was something else his father had said that peaked his interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cReinstate boundaries? I thought they just owned the land. That\u2019s why there\u2019s all those \u2018keep out\u2019 signs all over the Preserve. Or so I\u2019ve heard. Not that I\u2019ve\u2026..seen\u2026..them.\u201d</p>\n<p>His father sighed under the weight of the knowledge that he would have to have yet another stern conversation with his son about trespassing. It was already part of their regular rotation of \u2018conversations\u2019 the Sheriff was forced to have with Stiles on alternating weeks depending on the circumstances. But he didn\u2019t seem to be too interested in doing it tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cTerritories change all the time, new packs take over or branch off. Sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. We don\u2019t interfere as long as it stays within their community. But packs have to keep the records up to date, keep the county informed, otherwise they forfeit the land.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they\u2019re gone now.\u201d Stiles wondered why he hadn\u2019t seen that in his research. Maybe because he hadn\u2019t thought to look for it. \u201cThey\u2019ve been gone for years. Does that mean the Preserve doesn\u2019t belong to them anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all still theirs. And they aren't technically gone. This whole area is littered with Hale territories, and as far as I know, Talia moved the pack to an adjoining one to assist with some sort of sacred family duty or other, who knows with wolves. But she's never missed a deadline. Came in with a whole bunch of them last time.\u00a0That was about\u2026..three, four months ago?\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>What?!</em>\" Stiles all but yells, saved by the fact someone on his father's team decided to do something idiotic at just the right moment, causing the Sheriff to scream the exact same thing. After pretending to curse out whoever this Ramirez guy was, Stiles waited a beat before steering the conversation back on course. \"I had no idea they'd been\u00a0coming back here. How do the town gossips miss the entire Hale pack descending on City Hall?\"</p>\n<p>His father gave him a knowing side eye, \"They wouldn't, but it wasn't the whole pack. If I remember, it was just Talia and her second with a few of her Betas. Didn't hang out to chat either, signed the papers and left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, uh\u2026..you remember-- were you there? Did you, like, know them all?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy all these questions?\u201d His father sounded more amused than suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026we\u2019re covering the impact of the Civil War on werewolf packs in History class and it just got me thinking that I\u2019ve never properly met a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>This was the truth at least. There wasn\u2019t a single thing proper about the way he\u2019d met Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let me see. One\u2026two\u2026three\u2026yeah, there were five of them. Her oldest, I think her name\u2019s Lauren, or Laura, is her second. Spitting image of her mother, looked about ready to pop with those twins she was carrying. Then there was her son, Derek. He\u2019s grown up to be a real handsome fellow, shy though. Not that I blame him\u2026\u201d His dad mummers to himself, giving Stiles a startled look when he realized he\u2019d spoken that last part out loud. \u201cAnd then three kids, your age. Two boys and a real firecracker of a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe girl, what\u2019d she look like, dark hair, green eyes, anger problem bordering on psychotic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, she was blonde, very\u2026..blonde.\u201d His dad gestures in a way that Stiles interprets as <em>well endowed</em>. \u201cA little too friendly with the clerk, if you ask me and way too much makeup for a girl her age. And too much\u2026..hair.\u201d <em>Cleavage</em>, Stiles knows how to translate embarrassed father.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about Derek? The uh\u2026.the son. What was he like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ve had a long day and it\u2019s a school night for you. I think it\u2019s time for bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands abruptly and strides out of the room, the game screaming from the TV, tied at the bottom of the ninth.</p>\n<p>When Derek didn\u2019t show that night, or the next day, or the following night, Stiles wasn\u2019t able to shrug it off the same as he had last time. He felt anxious, jittery, his stomach roiling and his skin too tight. He couldn\u2019t go another night lying awake, staring at an open window and waiting and worrying and waiting until dawn came. He went online, he printed a map of the Preserve, he filled a backpack with every supply he could think of and texted his dad, working the night shift, that he was sleeping over Scott\u2019s.</p>\n<p>This time, when he drove out to the woods, he managed to find the road to the Hale house and took it as far as he dared. He didn\u2019t want to spook Derek if he was holed up out there. He had fresh batteries in his flashlight and more in his pack, but the beam did little to illuminate the heavy curtain of night hung round him.</p>\n<p>When a howl pierced the air, Stiles was so relieved he let out a shuddery laugh, running towards the sound before skidding to a stop, his better judgement kicking in. He waited, listening. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Another howl. More human this time, mournful and desperate. It\u2019s Derek, Stiles knows from the way his whole body pulls taut in response.</p>\n<p>When the road curves, the trees thinning, Stiles stopped dead in his tracks. The Hale house, the spooky, abandoned mansion in the woods, was not at all the weed choked, sagging ruin he\u2019d expected from all those many rumors Beacon Hills loved to deal out. It\u2019s beautiful, and huge and completely pristine, with not one but two separate buildings under construction behind the main property. If his father hadn\u2019t told him so the other night, seeing the house in this state would have been clue enough that the wolves had never really left- were, if fact, planning on returning.</p>\n<p>Two things happened as he made his way up the drive. From the shadows at the side of the house, he watched the Camero take shape, parked haphazardly, the back end covered in mud.</p>\n<p>Then a scream, a human scream of complete anguish rends the air. There\u2019s silence after that, but Stiles can still hear it ringing through his ears, Derek screaming with all he has from somewhere inside the house.</p>\n<p>Stiles only allows himself one second of panic, one ragged inhale and flailing of arms before he makes a move. Running over to the shell of one of the newer buildings, Stiles sweeps his flashlight over the grounds, looking for a 2x4, a discarded hammer, something. He finds a nice sturdy length of sawed off rebar, and that will do just fine.</p>\n<p>Creeping around, the front door is locked, the windows, too, but there\u2019s a back door leading into some sort of sun room that\u2019s open and he slips in as quietly as he can. He\u2019s not really sure what the plan is, or if he even has the skills to come up with something on the fly that will defeat an angry werewolf. Tiptoeing through the darkened house, Stiles can see that there are things knocked over, glass on the floor, streaks of mud and part of a bloody handprint wrapped around the door frame up ahead. There\u2019s no other sound, there\u2019s no way of telling where Derek might be in all these rooms. One after another, he paces the ground floor until he decides to try upstairs. There\u2019s a smell of dust and wet earth that pervades every room, a staleness despite how ordered everything seems. Bedrooms, a whole winding hall of them, and each one empty. His flashlight catches on a door up ahead, opened a crack and specked with mud. Stiles turns off his light and tucks it into his pocket, gripping the rebar with both hands and using the tip to push open the door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bedroom, or it had been. The furniture is still there, but everything has claw marks including the walls and the hardwood floors. In the corner, Stiles sees a figure, the outline of a shape huddled on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d He whispers, but it doesn\u2019t move. \u201cDerek?\u201d He gets closer, and the thin filtered moonlight is enough to realize it\u2019s not a person. A mattress, on the floor, heaped in pillows and blankets and most of all clothing.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 clothing.</p>\n<p>His ruined red hoodie, his lacrosse uniform, tshirts and three of his most worn out boxers. There\u2019s a hand towel from his bathroom and an old beanie he practically lived in last winter. There\u2019s one of his pillows. It\u2019s all heaped up in a circular mound, the center of which looks like it could very well fit the body of a curled up werewolf. Staring at it, Stiles\u2019 eyes get hot with tears. This empty house with a missing pack, and Derek all alone looking for comfort, grasping at the first thing to come along- a pathetic human kid lost in the woods. He was angry now, furious. He wasn\u2019t a werewolf, he wasn\u2019t strong like that, but he was damn sure going to do what he could to save Derek.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a banging sound, metal on metal coming from somewhere below him. Stiles pads back down the stairs, listens. There is was again. He follows the echo to a door tucked beneath the staircase that he\u2019d missed on his previous sweep. It opens to a set of steep stone stairs winding down, down, down into the pitch black underbelly of the house.</p>\n<p>Of course it does.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s afraid to use the flashlight, but more afraid not to, so he shines it carefully at the steps in front of him, careful not to let the beam swing wide. It\u2019s instantly colder down here, water dripping from the bricks, his skin clammy. It\u2019s two full rotations before the stairs end in a dirt floor, a long corridor stretching out with double rows of heavy metal doors, streaked red with bloody rust.</p>\n<p>Of course.</p>\n<p>Because why turn a subbasement into a nice, well-lit rec room, some vintage light fixtures, few couches, flat screen tv, maybe a wet bar, when you could have a murder basement? There were absolutely going to be hooks down here, big gnarly hooks hanging from chains. It was the must have accessory on every serial killer\u2019s Pinterest board, he just hoped he wouldn\u2019t find himself strung up on one.</p>\n<p>There was light flickering against the wall all the way at the end. There was a sound, too, a constant, sharp kind of rolling rush of noise that only barely covered the clang of something heavy hitting concrete and the sharp bark of a voice whose words he couldn\u2019t make out. Creeping in closer, Stiles listened with his whole body, almost falling back on his ass when a flash of blue lit up the hall followed by the sound of Derek howling in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Hey cut that out!\u201d Another flash, another scream, and that was definitely the voice of Miss Bitch Car Thief.</p>\n<p>Rounding the corner, Stiles found one last room, door opened wide and alight with candles and a battery powered lantern. He was hit head on with the smell of sweat and\u2026and\u2026.lavender?</p>\n<p>Dozens of candles in jars with twee floral labels lined the edges of the wall and all around a cage. A battle-scarred cage in the center of the floor, and inside, pacing with fangs and claws bared, was-</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d She snapped at him as he growled, pacing.</p>\n<p>The girl had her back to Stiles, standing in front of the cage with one hand on her hip and the other holding a baton. The end sparked-- a cattle prod. Stiles crouched as low as he could get and peeked his head further in, still unseen.</p>\n<p>The smell of lavender was so strong inside the room it made him gag, he could understand now why they hadn\u2019t scented him. And the noise\u2026..it was rain, thunder. A speaker hooked up to what he assumed was the girl\u2019s phone, blasting the sound of rainstorms at full volume.</p>\n<p>Stiles took a quick stock. On the table, next to the phone, was a key that looked about the right amount of medieval to open that cage. He couldn\u2019t get to it without her seeing him, but if he could buy a few seconds, maybe he could get Derek free and let him take care of the girl. He knew it was a terrible plan, but what the hell else was he going to do? If he called his dad, the Argents would get involved, and that was almost unequivocally a worse scenario.</p>\n<p>There was a second, not even that much, where Stiles had the rebar raised above his shoulder, ready to bring it crashing down on the girl\u2019s skull with all his impressive, adolescent strength, and Derek saw him. The Alpha froze, then rushed for the bars, gripping them in both clawed hands and howling so loud he nearly dropped his weapon in favor of covering his ears. The girl was startled, too, and Stiles took that opportunity to swing down as hard as he could, feeling the sickening sensation of bone cracking all the way to his back teeth.</p>\n<p>He tossed the bar to the ground with a clatter and dove for the key, scrambling to the cage and trying to get his shaking hands steady enough to fit it into the lock.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here big guy.\u201d Derek pressed himself up to the cage, pulling Stiles\u2019 arm through the bars so he could sniff his way up, whining the whole time. Stiles tried to pull away, the lock was heavy and he needed both hands to get it open. \u201cDerek, man, I\u2019m gonna get you out, you just gotta let me\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>The force with which he was thrown backwards was so sudden, all the air left Stiles\u2019 lungs in a rush and he didn\u2019t even feel himself hit the floor until he was already lying across the room in a jumble.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>God</em>, you have got to be the dumbest fucking human on the <em>planet</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles had to hand it to her, this girl had the end game villain look down cold. Blood streaked down her forehead and over her right cheek, matting her hair to the side of her head, her eyes glowed gold and she stood with her weight planted, ready to charge. The candlelight flickering sinister against her face, elongating the shadows of her claws. Derek charged the door of the cage, it rattled, but didn\u2019t budge.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you kill him!\u201d Stiles shouted at the same time the girl yelled, \u201cWhy do you refuse to stay rescued?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d They both startled. \u201cWait-\u201c \u201cHang on-\u201c \u201cStop!\u201d</p>\n<p>The talking over each other was getting ridiculous. Stiles shook both hands, the girl\u2019s claws receded, her eyes fading to green.</p>\n<p>\u201cRescued?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I kill him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you just want to torture him?\u201d Stiles was still ready to fight her for Derek\u2019s freedom, but the girl seemed to have lost all venom in her utter confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one torturing him, dumbass!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, is this a spa then?\u201d Stiles laughed sarcastically, \u201cWere you just exfoliating him with that thing?\u201d He pointed at the cattle prod lying on the ground behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking hate teenagers.\u201d She sighed, shoving a hand through her bloody hair. Derek charged the cage door again, this time knocking one of the hinges a little loose. \u201cCut it out!\u201d She yelled at Derek, glaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre werewolves immortal now? You look like you\u2019re barely old enough to drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>His blood ran cold, \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rammed the door again. \u201c<em>Stiles</em>,\u201d he growled. The girl jut her thumb toward the wolf with a flat expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s every five minutes with that.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNow will you please just leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, not until you let him go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre. You. Dense.\u201d She overenunciated at him. \u201cI put him in that cage to protect you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProtect me?! You\u2019ve done nothing but threaten my life!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>BANG </em>\n</p>\n<p>The cage door lost a hinge, the last three still holding. \u201c<em>Stiles</em>,\u201d Derek reached for him between the bars as far as his arm would stretch.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>\u2019Tell me where he is</em> <em>or else</em>\u2019, \u2018<em>you\u2019re running out of time to save your own ass\u2019</em>, any of that ring a bell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs in <em>\u2019Or else\u2019</em> he\u2019s going to come after you! I meant \u2018Save your own ass\u2019 literally!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLady, you need to work on your clarity of phrasing before you consider \u2018rescuing\u2019 people in the future because you seriously suck at it!\u201d</p>\n<p>This dungeon ambiance was really going to waste with all the bickering.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only person I\u2019m <em>really</em> trying to help here is him,\u201d She pointed at Derek who snapped at her finger. \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what happens to you, but I do care about what will happen to my brother if he rapes a minor!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother?\u201d Stiles reels. \u201cYou\u2019re his sister?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the part you\u2019re hung up on?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Cora.\u201d Stiles took a few steps toward her and Derek lost it, shaking the bars and roaring at Cora as if she were the one advancing on Stiles. The door sounded about ready to lose another hinge. She dove for the prod, sparks flying as she jammed it into Derek\u2019s side. The werewolf flew backwards with a howl, an acrid curl of smoke rising from his skin even as it healed. \u201cStop it! You\u2019re hurting him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora,\u201d From his hands and knees, Derek panted, his voice thin and hoarse from screaming. \u201cGet him out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying! But he\u2019s an even bigger dumbass than you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles ran to the cage, crouching beside the bars and reaching a hand between them. Derek\u2019s eyes were red again, that glazed, wild look seeping over his features. He scented the air and wheezed, huffed out a frustrated breath at the syrupy stench of lavender suffusing everything. He rammed the door once more, curling clawed fingers around the upper corner and pulling, pulling with all his strength until the metal began to wrap and bend, folding in with every vicious tug.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright creampuff, time to go!\u201d Cora hoisted Stiles off his feet, dragging him out of the room in a vice grip, a look of real panic on her face.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d made it halfway across the living room upstairs, Stiles arguing futility the whole way, when Derek finally got the door of the cage off and threw it across the room. It wasn\u2019t the kind of sound you could mistake, nor could you mistake the sentiment behind the ear-splitting roar that followed. Both of them froze, eyeing each other before Cora slung Stiles over her shoulder like a sack of grain and ran at top speed for the front door, barreling through it with a flying kick that would have impressed Stiles mightily if he weren\u2019t about to lose his organs through his nose.</p>\n<p>The ground rushed beneath him, the sound of a car door unlocking, the sound of a freight train made of muscle and teeth and claws smashing its way up from the basement. Cora swung the Camero\u2019s door open and threw her cargo bodily inside. His head hit the passenger window, Stiles groaned and rubbed the spot, but Cora was already shoving his legs out of the way and revving the engine, fishtailing around and peeling down the drive.</p>\n<p>Trees flashed by the windows, too fast to be safe, but Cora seemed much more concerned with putting distance between them and the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamnit. Shit. Goddamnit.\u201d Cora cursed with the sort of flat composure of the well and truly fucked. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me. He\u2019s going to actually kill me.\u201d Low hanging branches pummeled the windshield, rocks pelting against the undercarriage. \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t want to be his second anymore. Fuck seniority, Boyd can have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d Stiles yelled over the roar of the engine. He couldn\u2019t hear Derek behind them, but from the way Cora kept checking the rearview mirror, he was sure the wolf was in pursuit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou!\u201d She pointed at him. \u201cYou stupid, fucking asshole! Why would you come out here?! Deaton was <em>this close</em> to finding something that could help and now, if I somehow manage to live through the night, I\u2019ll have to track him down and get him locked up all over again! He almost bit off my arm last time, do you know how much that fucking <em>hurts</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell was I supposed to know you were trying to help him? Skulking around town screaming \u2018Tell me where to find him!\u2019 is sinister as shit, I thought you were trying to kill him because he somehow turned feral!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s <em>feral</em> because Derek is a broody, self-hating, cocksucker that\u2019s got his head too far up his own ass to listen to mom when she told him- she fucking TOLD HIM- something like this might happen if he didn\u2019t get his shit together! And you! Your ass is so damn lucky he\u2019s got a willpower of forged steel because any other wolf would have claimed you on the end of their knot by now!\u201d</p>\n<p>They turned hard onto the main road, smearing tracks of dirt along the asphalt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s been popping out of the shadows to spray me with a <em>profane</em> amount of come for the last few weeks. I think the claim has been pretty well staked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora looked like she was about to vomit, \u201cUgh, God, no to everything. I fucking hate you for making me put this into words that have to come out of my mouth, but, I can <em>smell</em> what he\u2019s done, and that\u2019s not a claim. Here,\u201d She pulled her phone out of her pocket, swerving a bit as she did, and tossing it into Stiles\u2019 lap. \u201cLook in my contacts and call Deaton, he\u2019s gonna have to meet us at the clinic and he\u2019d better have figured out a cure other than knotting a high schooler.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles, so wound up on adrenaline and fear and confusion, fumbled with her phone for another full block before his brain caught up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait- Cora stop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm, no? I\u2019m gonna go with no.\u201d She sped up, running a red light on the vacant street.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean <em>other</em> than knotting? Are you telling me if I have sex with Derek, he\u2019ll go back to normal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sex, dipshit, I\u2019m talking about <em>mating</em>. I\u2019m talking about him knotting your jail bait ass and taking you as his <em>mate</em>. He should have manned up and started courting you the moment he realized who you were--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d He barely realized he\u2019d spoken when the words were out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>The Camero screeched to a halt in the middle of the road. Cora turned in her seat, staring at him, knuckles white on the steering wheel before a sound behind them caught her attention and she accelerated hard. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. Mating means binding yourself to an Alpha whose pack consists of nothing but shitty teenagers. It means tying yourself to my grumpy, emotionally constipated brother for <em>life</em>, because if you hurt him I swear to God I will take my time and they will <em>never</em> find your body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me this,\u201d Stiles hands were shaking, but his mind was clear. \u201cWill it turn me? The whole\u2026.mating thing, cause I gotta tell you, I really don\u2019t want to be a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time, the perpetual anger Cora wore dissolved some, a startled softness that Stiles had a feeling was a rare look on her. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026yeah. I\u2019ve sorta grown attached to being human, even if it means I\u2019ll never play first line in lacrosse, but I\u2019m pretty sure I read somewhere it\u2019s harder for wolves to get college scholarships because there\u2019s a bias that thinks all packs are rich enough to pay for the full tuition. But I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable taking pack funds like that as the new guy and my Dad can\u2019t really afford four years on his own, so I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, will you shut up for a second? I meant about mating with Derek! Why would you do that, you don\u2019t even know him! Is it just because he\u2019s good looking? Because let me tell you, werewolves aren\u2019t immune to getting old and fat, it just happens slower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s not a huge bonus, because you\u2019d know I was lying, but there\u2019s more to life than being really, really ridiculously good looking.\u201d He got nothing. Did this girl not watch movies or was she morally opposed to fun? \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but I <em>know</em> that Derek is a good guy and he doesn\u2019t deserve to live like this. Whatever I can do to help him, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>They made it one more block, Deaton\u2019s clinic visible just up the street, when Cora pulled the brake and did a 180 Stiles would have enjoyed a lot more if he\u2019d been wearing a seatbelt.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me my purse, it\u2019s in the backseat.\u201d Cora said as she sped back the way they\u2019d come, cutting right to get closer to the edge of the Preserve. Stiles turned in his seat, found the black bag on the floor and hoisted it into her lap. Cora rummaged through it without slowing down or taking her eyes off the road.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, you\u2019ll need this.\u201d She said as she shoved something into his hoodie pocket then leaned over him, opening the passenger door, slowing but not stopping completely. \u201cTuck and roll, bitch!\u201d She yelled with some noticeable glee and shoved him out of the car.</p>\n<p>Well he definitely rolled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw.\u201d Stiles figured out which way was up and slowly got to his feet. Nothing felt broken, although he was going to have a bruise from landing on whatever Cora had put in his pocket. He fished it out. A small bottle of lube. Thoughtful, but it didn\u2019t absolve her from pushing him out of a moving car.</p>\n<p>Hobbling forward, Stiles wondered if she\u2019d be able to hear his very explicit thoughts about her general character and moral disposition now that the taillights had disappeared from view. He looked around, getting his bearings. He was just inside the tree line of the Preserve, the road only a few yards to his left, the great black maul of werewolf country surrounding him from every other side. He knew the general direction of the Hale house, and was sure that if he just walked in a straight line, he\u2019d have to run into it eventually. Right?</p>\n<p>It was so much harder without any real light to guide the way, unseen twigs snapped beneath his feet, invisible roots and divots tripping him every third step. It was cold too, now that he was coming down from a killer adrenaline high, Stiles couldn\u2019t stop shivering. He wrapped his arms around his body, wishing he\u2019d been smart enough to bring a jacket when a branch whipped him straight in the face. Or rather, he\u2019d been so caught up watching the ground in front of him that he\u2019d walked right into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my fuck I <em>hate</em> these woods!\u201d Stiles batted at the branches, thrashing about until he was sure the tree had learned its lesson. When he looked up, two red eyes glowed from the shadows. \u201cHey Derek.\u201d Greeting him as if they\u2019d just run into one another in a coffee shop.</p>\n<p>Derek took two steps from his cover of darkness, scented he air, and charged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, this is really emasculating.\u201d Stiles stuttered out. The Hales seemed to have a real penchant for slinging him over their shoulder and taking off like he was incapable of walking. At least Derek was doing a better job of not jarring him up and down like a cocktail shaker, probably because he was clinging onto Stiles with both enormous, muscular arms as if afraid someone might take his prize away if he didn\u2019t hold tight enough or run fast enough. And holy hell was he running fast, now he understood why Cora\u2019d felt the need to floor it. Derek had scooped him up what felt like <em>seconds</em> ago and they\u2019d just passed the jeep, which meant they had already made it back to the Hale house.</p>\n<p>Stiles could hear Derek scenting the air, but he didn\u2019t slow down, barreled right thorough the smashed front door and up the stairs. But when they got to Derek\u2019s room, the Alpha calmed, paused, breath heaving, before striding over to his nest on the floor and gently laying Stiles down. He backed off to prowl the perimeter of the room on all fours, scenting the widows, the hallway, closing the door and barricading it with a clawed up dresser. Not that it was large enough that Stiles couldn\u2019t move it on his own, or that a determined soul on the other side of the door, perhaps a bitchy werewolf sister who had some yet-unthought-of payback coming to her, couldn\u2019t shove it out of the way if they really wanted to get in. But Stiles was positive Cora wanted no part of her brother\u2019s sacred werewolf mating rites, or whatever was about to happen, and besides, he could appreciate the general sentiment behind Derek\u2019s action.</p>\n<p>In a second, Derek was on him, sweaty, filthy from possibly days in that cage, the healed over burns from the prod remaining as round smears of ash. He dove right into scenting all the dark fragrant joints of Stiles\u2019 body, pawing at him, maneuvering him so that he could get at the ripe, needy scent coming off the boy beneath him. And Stiles, for all his normal verbosity, went lax and quiet with flood of relief from having Derek warm and whole in his arms, of knowing that they were safe in this tiny shut off corner and that soon Derek would be better. Stiles could make him better and the thought made him unbearably grateful. He arched into the touches, the nose burrowing into his sides and the lips chasing, responding instinctively when Derek\u2019s face grew closer to his by drawing the man into a prolonged kiss.</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t kissed before, Stiles was sure they hadn\u2019t. No, he\u2019d remember this, the surprised pause before Derek melted and rushed at him like a tide, tongue delving hungry and leaving no sweetness unexplored. He dragged Stiles up into his lap, wound the thick bands of his arms around Stiles\u2019 slim torso and sat him down on the iron brand of his erection, snug between Stiles\u2019 legs, the heat of it seeping through the material of his jeans. Burying his hands in Derek\u2019s hair, Stiles rode down on Derek\u2019s cock, moaned into his mouth and did his best to keep up with the pace. He was overheated, dizzy from the lack of air being given to him, from the crazed way Derek seemed to want to devour him whole that banked Stiles\u2019 own desire so high he thought he might crack in two.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he croaked out, head dropping back when Derek moved on to refresh the marks he\u2019d previously left. And then Stiles was tumbling backwards, cold and confused as Derek rocketed back, slamming himself into the far wall. \u201cDerek? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>With his back pressed flat against the wall, Derek punched both clawed hands into the dry wall, as if anchoring himself in place. \u201c\u2026.claim\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stared up at him from the nest, \u201cUh\u2026yeah, that\u2019s kind of the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shook his head like a determined toddler and refused to budge. \u201c<em>NO</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes Derek</em>,\u201d he shouted, sarcastic but earnest. \u201cYou need to claim me so you can get better and I need you to claim me because you\u2019ve been rubbing that Alpha dick of yours all over me for weeks now but have yet to put it in me and if I don\u2019t get knotted and filled to the brim with your come I swear to god I\u2019m going to turn feral, too, and attack you!\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure if Derek could even understand everything he\u2019d said, but he did know one thing that would get Derek moving and he wasn\u2019t above playing dirty. Without getting any closer, because he wasn\u2019t sure if Derek would try to bolt, Stiles stood and slowly, deliberately undressed himself, scattering his clothes so that they added to the nest, the whole time staring Derek down with an expression that said <em>Well, what are you going to do about it? </em>Red eyes glowed back at him, a subsonic growl he could feel coming up through the floorboards, but still the wolf didn\u2019t move. Stiles dropped down, fished through his pockets to find the lube and drizzled it over his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d His voice hitched as he pushed one long finger inside himself without any hesitation. \u201cYou just gonna stand there and watch me suffer, or are you gonna give your mate what he needs?\u201d Two more fingers joined and Stiles grunted, but he needed all the stretch he could get. Shifting on his knees, Stiles began to ride his own hand, gasping, reaching out for Derek.</p>\n<p>It was frightening how quickly it worked, Derek falling to his hands and knees like his strings had been cut. He scrabbled over and scented the air all around Stiles\u2019 body, circling him before drawing up in front of him, whining as he took the boy\u2019s face in his large hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Stiles?\u201d He asked, timid and hopeful and holy shit now Stiles knew what it felt like to have your heart <em>break</em> for someone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Derek. Yours. I want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>A whine, and then Stiles was being hauled into Derek\u2019s lap, the man\u2019s mouth all over him, lips and blunt teeth and a flat tongue that dragged over everything with eager hunger that was undecided which it wanted more: to taste every supple inch, or to bathe Stiles in his scent. Stiles continued to finger himself open, but it was difficult with Derek clinging to him, and when his fingers slipped free, Derek\u2019s were right there, pushing two into the wet clutch of Stiles\u2019 hole, so much larger than his own.</p>\n<p>Moaning, Stiles felt around the floor until he found the bottle, squirted more lube blindly onto Derek\u2019s fingers as they drove into him, the slippery mess of it squelching between his cheeks. He grabbed Derek\u2019s hand, folded another of the man\u2019s fingers in tight and worked it into himself with the others. Oh God it was so good, so raw burning good that Stiles forgot for a moment that there was anything else on offer other than these wonderful, magical fingers working tirelessly up into him.</p>\n<p>But then he felt it, Derek\u2019s cock rubbing against the cut of his thigh and good lord, that was-</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hell, your knot,\u201d Stiles gasped, pushing back a bit so he could look between them. On average, Derek\u2019s cock was nothing short of magnificent. The veiny girth of it jut up <em>inches</em> above his own where they rubbed against each other. But below the tight red flush of the swollen head and the substantial shaft, a swell of purpling flesh that grew even as Stiles watched it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time, do we? Fuck I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s gonna fit but I just have to\u2026wait\u2026let me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slid off Derek\u2019s lap, off his fingers and scooted around until he was crouched on his knees with a breathtaking amount of Alpha cock swaying in his face. His mouth watered, he had been fantasizing about this exact thing for much longer than he\u2019d known Derek and having it be this Alpha, his Alpha, made him half mad for it. Without teasing, he grabbed a steady hold on Derek and wrapped as much of his mouth around that knot as he could and suckled at it. It was blistering hot against his lips, he was going to feel that heat when it was inside him, feel the way it pulsed with gathering blood like it was alive. Derek howled above him, but it was a decidedly human sound, in fact all the panting, the growling, the little whimpers as Stiles worked his mouth over Derek\u2019s erection and back down on that knot, sounded about as human as Stiles had ever heard him. And he fucking loved it, he wanted to break through, work open the cracks until he could pull Derek out of whatever madness had captured him with his body and his will.</p>\n<p>But there was only so much that Derek could take, apparently, and he\u2019d officially reached the end of his not-currently-mating-Stiles patience. With a toothy snarl, Derek manhandled Stiles onto his back-- and there was never going to be a point in time where a move like that didn\u2019t have Stiles gagging for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d His voice reedy, barely more than a hiss. \u201cGotta\u2026\u201d It took the last of the lube to fully coat Derek\u2019s cock, and when he was done, Stiles had to take moment to admire the view because sweet baby Moses, Derek looked like some kind of magnificent fever dream. Perched up tall on his knees, massive thighs flexing, drawing up to the prominence of his enormous Alpha cock that shown like a dangerous beacon in the meager light. Derek\u2019s abs contracted with his heavy breathing, the dark swirls of hair on his belly, his chest, up his powerful arms, making Stiles dizzy with the sight of this apex predator that was about to mate him. <em>Him</em>. Stiles liked himself just fine- scratch that, he was fucking awesome- but he still had no real idea why Derek had chosen him of all people. Not that he would ever turn it down.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d He spread his thighs and lay back, as clear an invitation as he could make without pointing directly, with great enthusiasm, between his legs. Not that Derek needed more detailed encouragement. He pressed Stiles further into the floor, nudging his side to turn him over until Stiles stopped him with a hand to his chest, legs wrapping around Derek\u2019s waist. \u201cNo, like this. God, you\u2019ve got to let me see you when we do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek watched him for a moment, unfathomable red eyes looking for something Stiles couldn\u2019t guess at, reluctance maybe? Dishonesty? Whatever it was, a few quiet puffs of air through his nose and Derek was taking Stiles hips in his hands, hitching a leg higher and all but challenging Stiles to look away as he began to press in. He didn\u2019t rush, which Stiles had almost expected him to do, just coiled in tight and bore his whole weight down to the point where they joined at a slow, insistent pace. And Stiles was mentally, if not physically, prepared for pain, a lot of pain. He breathed and relaxed and thought about flowers unfolding to the sun and all that crap, reminded himself that they\u2019d just made sure he was good and stretched, but that first inch still felt like it would tear him in half. He made some sort of sound, he wasn\u2019t sure, too busy doing his best to stay as still as he could and not push away from the terrible burn.</p>\n<p>And then the pain was gone.</p>\n<p>Totally gone, replaced by a woozy ache that didn\u2019t dampen the remaining sensation of Derek still forcing a space for himself deep inside Stiles\u2019 body. He looked down between them and saw the snaking black lines scrawling up both of Derek\u2019s arms. His brain would usually respond to a sight such as this with details, facts, a catalogue of salient points shuffling as fast as his ADD could manage, but even this affliction felt dragged out of him by Derek\u2019s miraculous, pain siphoning magic. Now all there was left was the glorious stretch as he was filled so completely. God, Derek was everywhere, so deep inside him he could barely breathe, a wall of muscle surrounding him, pinning him down, mouth and hands and cock, rocking in short little jabs as if proving a point. And Stiles agreed, he accepted, he sobbed, bore his neck and wanted nothing more in that moment then to find a way to open wider, take as much of Derek inside of him as he possibly could.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore\u2026.more\u2026.more\u2026\u201d Stiles chanted, totally unaware he was speaking. Derek grunted and shoved in harder, laid out his claim in longer strokes that rubbed Stiles <em>every perfect place please God don\u2019t stop Derek more Derek fuck me fuck me\u2026\u2026.</em></p>\n<p>The knot was catching now, a little further every time and ready to snap into place with the ease of all that lube if Derek would just give it to him a little harder. Stiles writhed, hands clawing at Derek\u2019s back as he begged for it, shameless and close to tears, needing so badly to come but unwilling to do so until he was knotted. He wasn\u2019t sure why it had to be that way, his brain was officially offline and whatever instinct remained screamed at him to take that knot so he could finally come on his Alpha\u2019s cock the way he was supposed to. With a snarl to match one of Derek\u2019s own, Stiles reared up and bit Derek\u2019s neck hard, hard enough that the impression of his teeth lasted more than a few seconds before healing. Derek roared, wrapped his large hands around Stiles\u2019 shoulders and slammed his knot all the way in, locking them together as he came, that insane torrent of Alpha seed that Stiles had witnessed many times now filling him, flooding him until he could feel the sloshing weight of it distend the soft swell of his belly. Derek\u2019s knot was still growing, wider and wider, it was so goddamned much Stiles\u2019 eyes rolled back as he was helpless to do anything other than follow Derek down, his own orgasm pulsing between them. Knot and cock and come and Derek\u2019s teeth at his neck and body nearly crushing him, owning him from every side, he\u2019d never felt anything like it, his whole being seizing up and locking onto this man that he wanted so much he stopped breathing and spots danced in his vision.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t remember falling asleep, more likely his body simply decided to shut down to make sure he hadn\u2019t actually died from coming so unnaturally hard. When he blinked his eyes open, Derek was still on top of him, gently licking the come from Stiles\u2019 chest. He was still deep inside Stiles, though the knot was shrinking and Stiles could feel the warm gush of Derek\u2019s come sliding out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he murmured, sleepy, smiling. But when Derek pulled out of him, taking away that comforting stretch that his body already needed like air, his face scrunched up and he whimpered, \u201cNo.\u201d He pleaded, needing more, needing Derek. With a low grumbling purr, Derek flipped Stiles over and shoved back in, already hard again and pistoning smoothly into Stiles\u2019 relaxed, come slick hole. And this time when he knotted Stiles, he didn\u2019t need to be coaxed. Fucked into his mate until that first catch and then locked them together with a determined thrust of his hips, filling him again, licking at Stiles mouth as he came on his knot once more like a mate should.</p>\n<p>This time, when Stiles fell asleep, it was after some effort not to. Derek\u2019s eyes were green and soft, his lips ruddy as he kissed Stiles and hushed him to sleep, hips still working his knot deeper into Stiles with the last sluggish pulls of his come. He was smiling at Stiles, looking just as sex drunk as Stiles was feeling, nuzzling into him until Stiles had no choice but to fall into safe, comforting blackness.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t expecting to wake up alone. He really, really wasn\u2019t, not after the way Derek had smiled at him, held him close and made him feel like the whole goddamned world was a splendid new adventure for them to explore and all that wretched love-struck shit. He was tucked into the blankets, a bottle of water and a tray of cold food waiting on the floor beside him enough evidence that Derek was most likely himself again, but the man was nowhere to be found. Not in any of the rooms, not the basement, and he could honestly say that daylight did little to alleviate the murder vibe of that place.</p>\n<p>He called for him all over the house, the grounds, only going so far into the woods that he could find the way back, which he did while a granite knot sunk from his throat to his belly. He refused to cry. It would be easier to get angry if he was in pain, if what they did last night remained as an insistent sting, a bruised hurt at his sensitive core, but whatever werewolf magic Derek had used still sang through him, leaving his whole body thrumming with a sweet, warm ache. Right now he hated it, hated that Derek had left him food and water and mystical pain meds and left him there as if that was enough of a thank you.</p>\n<p>Stiles trudged back up the stairs to Derek\u2019s room, but when he got there he realized he had nothing to collect. He was already dressed, and his things were still in the jeep. Staring at the mound of his pilfered clothing, Stiles grit his teeth, what was he going to do, take this stuff with him? Wash it, fold it and then wear it again someday? He didn\u2019t think he had a single day ahead of him that wouldn\u2019t be filled with thoughts of Derek, wearing that red hoodie on top of it would likely give him a nervous breakdown.</p>\n<p>It was dawn, and his father had worked late last night, so sneaking into the house was depressingly easy. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but he almost wished he\u2019d find his father sitting on the couch in his bathrobe, furious and disappointed and demanding answers. At least then he could tell someone, he would have an excuse for tears, for clinging to a sympathetic body and sobbing that he\u2019d never know he could feel so alone and so deeply, profoundly used.</p>\n<p>Stiles sat on his bed, staring off into space until he heard his father moving about in his room. He waited until his dad went downstairs to head into the bathroom, shower quickly and thoroughly and get dressed for school.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early. Got plans with Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looked around the kitchen, trying to remember how breakfast was supposed to work.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, I think Allison\u2019s giving him a ride, but I might want to see if he wants to come over after school if that\u2019s ok.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad gave him an amused look. \u201cStiles, it\u2019s Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ok?\u201d A touch of worry melting the edges of his smile. Stiles really didn\u2019t want that, he didn\u2019t know if the dam would hold if he started talking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! Super. Fine, just stayed up too late last night and forgot to turn off my alarm. Probably just go back to sleep after you leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, well, stay out of trouble and I\u2019ll see you for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Left alone, Stiles wasn\u2019t sure what to do with himself. He stared at his computer screen, for once confounded by what to ask Google. He scrolled his phone, fingers absently pressing into the purple mark hidden beneath the collar of his shirt. When it buzzed and rang in his hand, Stiles dropped it under his bed in shock. He cursed and crawled after it, answering without looking at the number.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey Louise,\u201d he greeted the woman on the other end. She had been one of the receptionists there since Stiles was a child. \u201cDid my dad forget his lunch again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d her voice sounded tight, and Stiles\u2019 heart rate spiked. \u201cI need you to come down to the station. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it, is my dad ok? What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, please get down here as soon as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then she hung up, and Stiles thought he would vomit all over the carpet. The whole way over his hands shook so much he was in real danger of veering into oncoming traffic. God his dad was dead, he knew it. He\u2019d been waiting for this call every day since his mom died even if he\u2019d never wanted to admit it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>OhGodOhGodOhGod\u2026\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>Rushing through the doors, Stiles skidded to a halt in front of Louise\u2019s desk. \u201cWas he shot? Is he at the hospital?! Which hospital?! Are-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d His father strode down the hall, intact and looking about ready to tear a grown man in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Stiles yelped automatically and his father stopped short, a wash of soft pain molding his features.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d he murmured, drawing Stiles into a long hug that was almost as frightening as thinking he\u2019d been dead. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He led Stiles down the florescent lit hall to a door with a single security window. The Sheriff didn\u2019t take his hand off Stiles\u2019 shoulder even as he pointed inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know that man?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles peered inside and his stomach dropped.</p>\n<p>Sitting at the interrogation table, his head in his hands as if the world were dying, was Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek.</p>\n<p>In a clean set of clothes. In <em>shoes</em>. And he looked like absolute shit but he still looked amazing to Stiles and he hated himself just a little that all he wanted to do was run in there and find out if he was ok and hug him and-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles? You\u2019re not in any trouble, no matter what you tell me. And I can swear to God that that man won\u2019t ever hurt you again.\u201d His father sounded like he was ready to break rocks with his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmm\u2026.what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s take this slow, ok son? Do you know that man in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeeaaah, it\u2019s Derek Hale. What\u2019s going on? Is he ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I need for now. I\u2019m going to have one of the other officers ask you a few questions, just so we get a clear picture of what he did to you. I swear I\u2019ll be right here if you need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what the hell are you talking about? Why is Derek\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>In one terrible moment of clarity, Stiles translated the look on his father\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a heavy door, but Stiles managed to throw it open with sufficient drama, deeply gratified by the look of shock on Derek\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you tell my dad!?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>And dear Lord, Derek could do haunted devastation like nobody\u2019s business. The urge to immediately throw himself on Derek like a blanket and shield him from the world rocked over Stiles in an unwelcome wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Hale has turned himself in for\u2026..sexual assault.\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t need to see his father behind him to know that the man deeply wished they weren\u2019t in the station so he might have an opportunity to unholster his gun.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s not sexual assault if I was a willing, enthusiastic participant that gave verbal consent!\u201d Stiles shouted at Derek. \u201cWhy are you so goddamned dramatic?! Why couldn\u2019t you have just stuck around this morning for the awkward conversation and missing socks like a normal person?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek was looking at him like a child whose favorite toy had just been ripped from its hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you couldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did the police kick in the door to your house? Do you have an ass full of wolfsbane bullets right now? No? Because that\u2019s what would happen to someone who did something to me I didn\u2019t want! I <em>wanted</em> to be with you, to be there for you when you\u2026.needed me. And, yes, I really, really wanted to fu-- have sex you Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles\u2026\u201d His father\u2019s voice sounded worryingly strangled, but he couldn\u2019t face him right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE A MINOR!\u201d Derek all but roared, eyes tinting red but fading fast. He turned in his seat, slumping down and staring at the over worn table top. \u201cEven if you did want it, it\u2019s still statutory rape. I still deserve to be punished.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Stiles, so frustratingly angry that he was being forced to do this <em>here</em>, in front of this <em>father</em> of all the fucking places with the fucking surveillance cameras and that goddamn Barbara was totally listening at the door and self-sacrificing cuntbag wolves\u2026..he snatched up the manila file folder that lay innocuously on the table and whapped Derek over the head with it twice, took a calming breath, then whapped him once more for good measure.</p>\n<p>The look of pure incredulity on the Alpha\u2019s face was worth it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m eighteen you navel gazing twat! In fact, I\u2019ll be nineteen in less than a month! And just to make sure that you never, ever forget my birthday, I\u2019m making you take me out to dinner! A really fucking expensive one, and not one of those shitty expensive steakhouse places, but somewhere that serves caviar! And sea urchins! I\u2019ve never tried either of those and I probably won\u2019t like them, but you\u2019re going to take me there anyway and you\u2019re going to pay for it because right now I deserve it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d His dad tried to cut in again but Derek wasn\u2019t done.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re in high school.\u201d As if he was unwilling to accept that Stiles was not somehow off limits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a <em>senior</em> in high school who was held back a year due to ADD and my mom passing away. Which you would have known if you\u2019d given me like an hour, thirty minutes tops, to check off all the boring first date intro stuff!\u201d</p>\n<p>The brief silence that follows is broken by Stiles, naturally, smacking Derek across the head one last time with the folder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take this.\u201d The Sheriff gingerly plucks the file from Stiles\u2019 hand like it\u2019s a loaded gun. \u201cSo, are we going to talk about what this is? I\u2019m still feeling inclined to arrest him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend dad, and we talked about this a long time ago that if I ever had a boyfriend you weren\u2019t allowed to arrest them just to scare them off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have questions.\u201d In full cop mode.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles, facing his dad with both hands on his hips, stands beside Derek who looks completely shell shocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know Derek? He\u2019s older than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot by much.\u201d Stiles shot back. \u201cI know Cora Hale.\u201d This wasn\u2019t exactly a lie, it just wasn\u2019t the answer to his father\u2019s question, but Stiles has been doing this dance for years.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been dating, secretly? For how long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot long, I met him after a party. Lydia\u2019s party, you remember that? We sort of ran into each other afterwards and just started\u2026.seeing each other around town. I liked him, he liked me, we were never exactly dating, dating, but Derek was always pretty clear that he was interested in something more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat more being sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek made a strangled noise beside him. \u201cWell, I mean, yes, but also a relationship. A\u2026uh,\u2026a serious relationship. And I only slept with him once, and only after it was clear he was in this for the long haul. The plan,\u201d he side-eyed Derek and dared him to say otherwise. \u201cWas to have him over for dinner, after we made it official. I would make pot roast, you would clean your guns in the living room, all the normal boyfriend meets the family stuff. But after a night of passionate love between two <em>consenting adults</em>,\u201d It was his father\u2019s turn to groan and burry his face behind a hand. \u201cThis weirdo got the wrong idea, freaked out and thought it might be a super great plan to come down here and get himself arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d The Sheriff turned his interrogative gaze on Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201c Derek looked between the Stillinskis, \u201cYes. But Sir, if I might add,\u201d He rose to his feet, squaring off with the Sheriff who didn\u2019t cow an inch when faced with the broad, intimidating frame of the Alpha. \u201cHe was right about my intentions. I would like to continue\u2026dating\u2026.your son for as long as he\u2019ll have me. The only thing I want to do is to care for him, protect him with my life, I swear to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Stiles shouldered Derek aside. \u201cNo need to enact a blood oath, it\u2019s not even noon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d the Sheriff stated. \u201cI don\u2019t like that I had to find out about you two this way, and I don\u2019t entirely like the fact that you are a new Alpha with a new pack to care for and you\u2019re starting this when my son is about to head off to college. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how possessive Alphas can get, the town still talks about that time some out-of-towner tried to take your mother\u2019s parking spot at Target.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m going to college.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Derek and his father were too busy playing death glare chicken. \u201cI would never try to keep him here, or stop him from going to whatever school he wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m right here guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI respect my son\u2019s judgement, but you\u2019re gonna have a ways to go after this little stunt you just pulled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant guys. Did you know that?\u201d They continued to ignore him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo stunt, if I thought I\u2019d done anything harmful to your son, I would willingly turn myself over to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a mark in your favor then, I guess.\u201d The Sheriff grunted, but he was pulling a full cowboy squint on Derek. Stiles hadn\u2019t seen him do one of those in years.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a tattoo, too. It says STYLIN\u2019 across my stomach in Old English font, but, you know, tasteful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo first things first, I expect you over for dinner at our house sometime this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nodded like he\u2019d just been handed the launch codes with orders to fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then I want to meet your pack. On your territory. I assume you\u2019re officially taking over the Hale land here in Beacon Hills so I\u2019m letting you know right now that I will be involved in every step of that transition so that I can make sure the pack living here is healthy and stable enough for this town and for my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I demand two horses and the finest of your goats for the hand of my first born!\u201d Stiles declared in a rather spot on impression of his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have full rights to enter my territory whenever you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff nodded, finally placated some by Derek\u2019s blunt acceptance. \u201cThen I guess you\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright dad, out. I\u2019m commandeering this interrogation room to yell at my boyfriend about proper morning after etiquette. You probably don\u2019t want to be here if you\u2019d ever like us to make eye contact again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Much to his amusement, the bulk of his father\u2019s steely demeanor dissolved, a sheepish tint coloring his cheeks as he grumbled something of an excuse before hustling out of the room.</p>\n<p>Turning to face Derek, Stiles took him in, took in the clear eyes and straight back, muscled arms bulging when Derek crossed them in front of his chest, an intimidating looking posture, but Stiles was certain Derek just didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands. The silence stretched out because Stiles had so many things to say, to ask, that he wasn\u2019t sure where to start.</p>\n<p>Derek did it for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell he\u2019s got a bad ticker and you just waltzed in here saying you\u2019d raped his son, so I think we better ease him into the whole mates thing, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- you don\u2019t have to. Mates are\u2026..you don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d Derek all but kicked an invisible rock with toe, hands shoving down into the pockets of his jeans. Man, this guy was ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re going to put a stop to this thing where you think you know better, because the evidence is in that you clearly don\u2019t. You may be bigger and stronger and sexier than me, but I am absolutely smarter than you and you\u2019re going to have to come to terms with that. I <em>know</em> what mates means, I know that it means that as a human I could walk away but you can\u2019t, but I also know the science on that is flawed because I <em>can\u2019t</em> walk away Derek, I don\u2019t want to. You want me and I want you and you\u2019re just going to have to live with the fact that this is happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <em>know</em> me, I was an animal before, but as a person I\u2019m\u2026..I\u2019m not easy to get along with. You don\u2019t really know who I am, Stiles. Why would you want this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolled his eyes, \u201cI know you, Derek. You may have been driven by your wolf side before, but animals can\u2019t hide what they are. You protected me, you wanted me but you didn\u2019t take anything until I wanted to give it. You fought yourself and your urges this whole time just because deep down you\u2019re a good person and would never willingly hurt me. That sounds like some A+ mate material right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s arms dropped to his sides, his hands twitched like he wanted to reach for Stiles but was afraid to.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t\u2026.you didn\u2019t do that with me just to help me get better? Because you did, I\u2019m me again because of you\u2026..because\u2026.I\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re barely better at making sentences now than you were then. Yes, I mated you because Cora basically told me it was the sure-fire way to get you back. But!\u201d He interjected when the curtain of blank resolve dropped over Derek\u2019s features. \u201cThere basically isn\u2019t a known set of circumstances where I wouldn\u2019t want to sit on your knot and have your werewolf babies and live happily ever after as den mother to your pack if you had shown the slightest interest in me. I want both Derek, I want you to be well, <em>and</em> I want to be your mate. It\u2019s really not- whoa!\u201d</p>\n<p>His feet left the ground as Derek whirled him through the air and onto the table and suddenly Stiles was being kissed so thoroughly his body reacted the only way it knew how, legs wrapping around Derek\u2019s hips and arms snaking around the solid slope of his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God Stiles,\u201d Derek groaned as he moved down to the tender spots on Stiles\u2019 neck, mouthing at the marks there in a way that had Stiles considering he was going to need a whole lot more scarves from now on. \u201cWanted you so much, wanted to have you but I couldn\u2019t\u2026.I didn\u2019t know it would happen like this. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, just-\u201d Stiles groaned at the heavy suction working over his collarbones. \u201cYou\u2019re normal now, right? No more naked sex beast stalking the woods?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you want me to.\u201d He continued kissing Stiles everywhere he could reach, holding him tightly against him as if letting go would cause physical pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna tell me what happened?\u201d Stiles gasped, trying as hard as he could not to get distracted, but Derek wasn\u2019t making it easy. \u201cWhy you went feral? Did hunters do that to you? How-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Derek growled, shoving a large hand up Stiles\u2019 shirt to pluck at a peaked nipple.</p>\n<p>Someone knocked at the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cCram it Barbara, I\u2019m working a perp here!\u201d Stiles shouted over Derek\u2019s shoulder, but he was already pushing away with a sigh. \u201cI have to go, and I\u2019m guessing you need time to get your house back in order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI..I do.\u201d Derek frowned, clearly unhappy at the prospect of leaving Stiles. \u201cI need to secure my pack, I need to talk to Deaton and prepare things for them, for you. I need some time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yup. I\u2019m sure you got a whole lot of unpaid bills to take care of after going full wolfman.\u201d Stiles did his best to make it sound light. He wasn\u2019t sure he succeeded. \u201cBut we\u2019re not done, we need to talk about this, I expect answers, ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Stiles could be wrong, but Derek looked distinctly embarrassed at the thought, but it was hard to tell under all that stubble. \u201cIt\u2019s over. And it will never happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorted, \u201cNice try.\u201d He looked at the door, suddenly uncertain what would happen when he walked through it. \u201cDo you still want to come over sometime? For dinner? I mean\u2026whenever, or not. I don\u2019t even know how to get ahold of you, do you even have a phone or did you, like, eat it or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek was suddenly there, holding Stiles\u2019 face in his hands and staring down with so much intensity Stiles though he might combust. \u201cTomorrow night, 7pm. I\u2019ll be at your house for dinner. Do you really know how to make pot roast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles sighed and Derek kissed him once, softly. \u201cAnd my dad\u2019s got a drawer full of wolfsbane bullets, too. It\u2019s going to be so uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>Exactly as promised, Derek Hale knocked on the door of the Stillinski home at 7pm the next evening. He looked ready to stand before the firing squad, but he\u2019d brought the Sherriff a bottle of excellent scotch and shook his hand firmly but not too firm, sniffed the air appreciatively and even attempted small talk.</p>\n<p>To Stiles\u2019 utter embarrassment, Derek and his father spent the entire meal verbally circling one another as if working out a peace treaty with lives in the balance. There were a lot of grunts, and pointed looks and decisive gesturing with the tip of a steak knife. But somewhere between Stiles bringing out dessert and clearing away the dishes while the other two men retired to the living room, they\u2019d found some common ground and were practically friendly by the time he joined them, Derek straight backed on the couch, his father deeply reclined in his chair. Stiles had arrived just as they were talking about the old pack, about Derek\u2019s mother and her new place taking over for another Hale Alpha in a territory up north.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Madge is actually her great grand aunt from her mother\u2019s side. Her pack is the largest of all the Hales\u2019, but she was getting too old and a rival pack had been circling their borders for months. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand a direct attack, so she called in my mother. At the time, we were going through some\u2026.difficulties with the Argent family.\u201d Derek looked over at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember.\u201d The Sheriff said, his eyes going gentle and his shoulders relaxing a tiny bit more. Stiles remembered what his father had said, about Derek having good cause to be shy and wondered again what exactly had occurred all those years ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother thought it might be a good reason to get away for a while. It was only supposed to be temporary, with two Alphas and our combined numbers, we could secure the territory and be back in a year. But the Feldon pack decided to fight. It was very long, and costly and\u2026\u2026there are rules, but their Alpha was losing numbers and getting desperate, he attacked my sister who had just become pregnant. In a fight like this\u2026.it\u2019s just not done. I lost it, and killed the Alpha even though it wasn\u2019t my right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t groomed to be the Alpha.\u201d His father guessed. Or maybe knew, Stiles was beginning to suspect his father knew a lot more about the local werewolf culture than he let on.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek clenched his fists then quickly released them. \u201cBut it worked out, I guess. Aunt Madge ceded her pack and her lands to my mother, who ceded the Beacon Hills territory to me. Some of the younger Betas have already joined my pack, my sister Cora is my second. They\u2019ll be moving back here soon, and I have a feeling one or two others from my mother\u2019s pack that miss this place will wish to join them. It\u2019s not a very large pack, and I\u2019m still learning\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine son.\u201d His father replied, practically paternal now that Derek had told his story. But it wasn\u2019t everything, not nearly, and Stiles was vibrating out of his skin to ask more, but there was no way of doing that without cluing his father in that Derek had been wandering the woods feral for months. And he may have lapses in impulse control, but he wasn\u2019t about to blow up this nascent acceptance of his new boyfriend after everything that had happened.</p>\n<p>Derek, the utter bastard, sensed Stiles\u2019 dilemma. \u201cDinner was delicious, thank you Stiles.\u201d He stood and offered his hand to the Sheriff who rose and accepted. \u201cAnd thank you for having me, Sir. I know I\u2019ve caused some trouble here, but I want you to know that I plan on doing whatever it takes to make your son happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d The Sheriff showed him to the door while Stiles grit his teeth at the chaste little kiss Derek landed on his cheek, once again foiled from having his questions answered.</p>\n<p>Derek disappeared. Again. But at least this time he had some idea where. His father mentioned that Derek had been down to the courthouse taking care of some paperwork. A neighbor mentioned that a new Hale Alpha had been clearing out the hardware store of practically everything. Scott barged into his room, whisper-shouting that Derek Hale had just come in to see Deaton, walking and talking like a normal person except for the fact that they\u2019d kicked Scott out so they could conduct some secret meeting and did Stiles know that Derek was the new Beacon Hills Alpha? Stiles felt bad about that one for a moment, he hadn\u2019t been keeping Scott up to date on his werewolf mate situation lately but in all honesty, looping Scott into the craziness of the last few days would have been more hassle than it was worth. It was always a long, protracted slog to get Scott to change his mind about someone once his opinion had been set, and Stiles had other things to worry about.</p>\n<p>The whole town was buzzing with the news of Derek returning home as the new Alpha. Literally buzzing, now Stiles knew where that phrase came from. Everywhere he went, people were talking in excited clusters and they were all talking about the same thing. And it was <em>maddening</em> because for the first time, everyone else in existence seemed to be running into Derek except Stiles. He\u2019d wanted to give Derek time, he knew the man needed it, but it was all he could do not to hop in the jeep and head over to the Hale house himself just to see him. He missed him.</p>\n<p>With some seriously spooky timing, Cora showed up at his front door the next day, her attitude just as sunny and delightful as ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, god you still smell like him, don\u2019t you ever shower? Give me your phone.\u201d She reached around to yank it from Stiles\u2019 back pocket, grunting in annoyance when she discovered it was locked. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Cora, how are things? You\u2019re looking well, the low simmering rage really puts color in your cheeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Without looking up, Cora paused her typing to give him the finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d she tossed the cell back, smirking when Stiles fumbled in a bid not to drop it. \u201cNow you have everyone\u2019s contact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d Stiles scrolled through his phone and noticed several names besides Cora\u2019s that he didn\u2019t recognize and one he did. \u201cThis is Derek\u2019s number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026<em>yeah</em>.\u201d Her tone switching from sarcastic to flatly bored. She sighed, \u201cAs second to Alpha Derek Hale I am here to inform you that your presence is requested this Sunday at twelve o\u2019clock at the Hale Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hale <em>Manor</em>? It\u2019s a manor now? Who is he Mr. Darcy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like Lord Greystoke,\u201d Cora said without missing a beat. Stiles\u2019 mouth hung open.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god\u2026\u2026.are you- like- <em>funny</em>? Does your family know you have a sense of humor or do you have to kill me now so that no one ever finds out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora\u2019s slow grin made him feel exactly like a pinned rabbit, \u201cThey\u2019re all going to be there you know, not just Derek\u2019s pack, but mom\u2019s, too. Time to meet the in-laws, so try to wear something that doesn\u2019t have cartoon characters on it. See you there!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmygodohmygodohmygod\u2026\u201d He was barely whispering but two more faces peeked out of the front window then disappeared.</p>\n<p>The front and side yard of the most estimable Hale \u2018manor\u2019 was littered with cars. And not just cars, but multiple utility transport vehicles. There were mini vans and passenger vans and a mini charter bus and four separate RVs that looked bigger than most houses. Clearly managing volume was the name of the game here, and it made Derek\u2019s tiny black sports car look like an aberration.</p>\n<p>And he wasn\u2019t a werewolf, but sitting out here in his ratty jeep, quietly having a small panic attack, Stiles could practically <em>sense</em> the mass of people barely contained in that giant home.</p>\n<p>Homes, really. Somehow, with the kind of money and authority that Stiles couldn\u2019t even conceptualize, Derek had fixed up the main house, completely finished the second, and was close to done on the third if the boxes of large appliances sitting beside the garage door were any indication. In a week. Who gets contractors to finish their <em>lunch breaks</em> in a week? Had he threatened to kill them? Probably at least one of them.</p>\n<p>Stiles made it out of the jeep, but still needed a minute to work up the nerve to approach the front door. From the side of the house, Stiles noticed three little faces peering from around the corner, escapees that made it past what was clearly an order to stay away from the human freaking out in their yard until properly introduced.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe smells scared.\u201d One whispered loudly, a boy too young to gage how easily voices could travel.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> smell scared,\u201d A fractionally older boy goaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he move?\u201d The younger boy asked, \u201cWe can\u2019t have chicken fingers until he comes inside and I\u2019m <em>starving</em>. Tell him to move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, he\u2019ll hear you! We\u2019re not supposed to be here, do you want to get in trouble?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did Derek pick him? He smells weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell weird, he just doesn\u2019t smell like pack yet. And you\u2019re not supposed to call him Derek, he\u2019s Alpha now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh uh, he told me I didn\u2019t hafta call him that. He <em>said</em> I could call him Derek! Mitchy, didn\u2019t he <em>say</em>?\u201d The little one turned imploring eyes on the girl behind him who had been watching Stiles with silent scrutiny the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d she offered, and the little boy shot a smug look at his other companion. \u201cBecause you\u2019re little and you\u2019re still learning about pack. Only the bigger people call him Alpha, like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, he\u2019s gonna hear you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo he won\u2019t he\u2019s human, they can\u2019t hear like us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles took some amusement in looking directly at them. All three children startled, the older two taking off the way they\u2019d come, but the youngest straightened up, creeping out of his hiding spot, impulsively brave.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can come inside now. Derek wants to see you, like, <em>real</em> bad and everybody\u2019s pretty nice except for Amy \u2018cause she never lets anyone play with her robot panda and we got chicken fingers with, like, three sauces but only one of those is the spicy kind. I don\u2019t like spicy sauce. I like cupcakes and we have cupcakes, too, but they\u2019re only for after lunch but if you don\u2019t want a cupcake, can I have yours? Mom says if you an\u2019 Derek let us be in your pack we can move here an\u2019 I can go to the real school for Kindergarten and get my own pencil box with new crayons and a glue stick and red scissors and a red pencil sharpener \u2018cause the teachers don\u2019t want us t\u2019use our claws in class. They call your mom if you do and then I don\u2019t get to watch Clarence when it\u2019s my TV turn.\u201d By the time the kid took a breath, he was standing right up in Stiles\u2019 space, adorably big eyes staring at him, small, grubby hand sneaking its way into Stiles\u2019 as if he was already family. Just then the front door opened, Derek filling the frame, arms crossed, eyebrow raised at the both of them. Stiles didn\u2019t let go of his new friend\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is he and can I keep him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid your mother say you should be out here, Andre?\u201d Derek admonished the boy, but there was no heat in it. Even so, Andre ducked further behind Stiles, shaking his head guiltily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see what you\u2019re doing here,\u201d Stiles narrowed his eyes at Derek \u201cSending one of the cute ones out to soften me up so I\u2019m not so completely terrified to meet your family. Well it worked. Thank you, buddy, I feel much better.\u201d He smiled down at the little boy who lit up with delighted relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles said I can have his cupcake!\u201d he shouted, darting up the porch steps and shoving past Derek into the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! That was never implied!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek made his way over to Stiles slowly, as if expecting him to bolt at any second. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if he ambushed you, he can be really chatty when he gets going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding? It was like coming face to face with myself as a child. I feel like I should reassure his mother that it gets better, but she\u2019d hear I was lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to come in now?\u201d Derek smiled, but it was uncertain, just like the hand reaching tentatively for Stiles\u2019 own, fingers carefully twining. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wrong, we do have chicken fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>is</em> a hard offer to resist.\u201d He said, sliding in closer. This was the moment where they would kiss, but instead Stiles found himself wrapping his arms around Derek\u2019s middle, tucking into his body while Derek cradled his head and fit them together in a tight embrace. It was something Stiles hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d needed so much, a brittle, anxious knot easing in his chest the moment they were together. God he could stay here forever, Derek smelled so good, he was so warm and big and safe feeling, and the world outside their cocoon was rapidly melting away. Derek tugged the collar of his shirt, growling when the fabric of the button-down wouldn\u2019t stretch as far as he needed. Quick fingers popped open the top button so he could get a look at the fading bruise on the joint of Stiles\u2019 neck, running his lips over it, pressing into it as if ready to bite. And Stiles was <em>so</em> on board with that, mind wiped completely clean of where they were and who was gathered a few yards away. Without hesitation, he arched his neck further, a tiny pleading whimper slipping from his throat. Derek held him tighter, inhaling his scent, then letting him go.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Erica.\u201d He grumbled, \u201cI am not.\u201d And Stiles needed a minute to redirect his brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha- oh\u2026\u201d He blushed. \u201cThat is never not going to be weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bedrooms are soundproofed, but most of the rest of the house is not.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it killed Stiles that he had an amazing comeback for that, but couldn\u2019t say it for the same reason that apparently Derek\u2019s whole goddamned family was listening in.</p>\n<p>He fixed his shirt. \u201cAlright big guy, lead the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Understanding was one thing, but being faced with the reality of the situation was entirely another. There were <em>so many</em> of them. A churning rush of happy faces and greetings and names he forgot the moment they were spoken because there was no discernable pause between one introduction and the next. Every room they entered revealed a similar scene, dozens of adults of every age taking over all available seating, a minimum of one mother nursing in the comfiest chair, some with tiny newborn bundles, other babies pawing at their mother\u2019s face with playful chubby hands. There were children everywhere, herds of them tearing through the house or climbing the furniture in a game Stiles\u2019 couldn\u2019t possibly follow, the adults seemingly immune to the clamor, long since accepting defeat when they were so outnumbered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d A voice cut through the din, clear and firm. And every single wolf in the house went silent and still. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you, may I give you a hug?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman approaching him through a path in the crowd was tall and lovely and without question Derek\u2019s mother. Stiles had heard enough about Talia over the years that he\u2019d formed his own image of her, but it wasn\u2019t at all the woman that was standing before him now with an open smile. She was dressed casually, fitted jeans and a soft, stylish tshirt. She was what his father would have called a very handsome woman, but most of her allure Stiles would attribute to the air of absolute command she carried with her. When she spoke, she expected those around her to listen, and they did. And Stiles was certain, from the assured way she moved, the visible strength that radiated from her, that this respect had been rightfully earned.</p>\n<p>With a tiny nod and wide eyes, Stiles allowed himself to be drawn into the brief, motherly squeeze Talia wrapped him in. She even <em>smelled</em> like power, if that was even possible to detect with his paltry human senses. He wasn\u2019t even sure what that meant, but he felt like every other wolf in the room must feel, obediently waiting for her next word.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you care to join me in the library for a moment? I\u2019d love the chance to get to know you better.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was probably the most warmly gracious command Stiles had ever heard and he nodded, croaking out an embarrassingly terrified, \u201cSure!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rest of you can go eat, the three of us will join you shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>So at least Derek was coming with him, that was good, that was a relief. Stiles didn\u2019t see the crashing tide of people descending on the food as he and Derek were lead away, but he could hear it and it made him at least a little glad that he was avoiding that chaos for the moment.</p>\n<p>Striding though the downstairs halls, Stiles noticed how incredibly different the house looked now that it was fixed up, the furniture uncovered, everything clean and cheery and so unlike the sad, dreary shell Stiles had run through not so long ago. There were rooms he hadn\u2019t even noticed before, and it was into one of these that Talia lead him, a cozy space of warm leather sofas and chairs, a long table at the center of scratched but lovingly polished wood, the walls that weren\u2019t covered in shelves of books papered in a tasteful hunter green.</p>\n<p>Talia took a seat on one of the club chairs, gesturing for Stiles and Derek to seat themselves on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea how grateful I am for what you\u2019ve done for my son.\u201d She began, which made Stiles immediately turn red because what they were talking about here, in essence, was his willingness to get plowed by Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmm\u2026you\u2019re welcome? This is weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about this now.\u201d Derek interjected, looking just as uncomfortable as Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, you know what,\u201d Stiles straightened up. \u201cI have some questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything you wish to know about the pack I will offer you, you\u2019re family now.\u201d She smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot about the pack, about Derek. About how this happened. I still don\u2019t understand why he went feral like that and this guy\u2019s been less than forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Talia looked genuinely taken aback. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? But then why did you- Derek, didn\u2019t you explain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was meaning to do it later,\u201d Derek grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell guess what, hot stuff, later is now. I\u2019m calling it in.\u201d Stiles was struck with a sudden delight at having this conversation with Derek\u2019s mother. Turnabout was fair fucking play if you asked Stiles, and if Derek thought for a minute he could assume Stiles\u2019 age or inexperience with wolves meant he would be easy to keep in check, he bet on the wrong fucking horse. \u201cI want to know everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek.\u201d And <em>wow</em>. That was some nuclear level mom-shame coming off Talia. \u201cThis boy took you in, he didn\u2019t give you to the hunters, though he had every right to. He mated with you of his own free will and he\u2019s here meeting your pack which means he wishes to stay your mate. I think someone like that deserves honesty when they ask for it, despite your own embarrassment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Alpha,\u201d Derek frowned, looking at his lap but seeking the comfort of Stiles\u2019 hand in his, which his mate freely gave. Stiles had so much to learn from this woman. \u201cI\u2026..you\u2026.you\u2019ve always been my mate.\u201d He managed to admit, taking his sweet ass time to collect himself afterwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that it? What does that even mean?\u201d Stiles elbowed Derek when he remained quiet for too long.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means that\u2026\u2026I\u2019ve known for a long time\u2026..that it\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat my son is so eloquently trying to say is that, wolves, typically, know their mate immediately upon scenting them. But sometimes that first encounter does not always come at the most opportune time. Our drive for a mate is strong, but can be managed if it would in any way harm the intended.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the Sherriff. He- I could smell you on him when\u2026...Kate\u2026..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek has a cruel history with some of the local hunters, and one in particular tried to use him to take out her hatred of werewolves on our pack. Your father became involved when we were forced to call the police, and it was at that time that Derek caught your scent on the Sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew. But you were so young then.\u201d Derek added. \u201cI watched you once, riding your bike with a friend and you looked so impossibly young and happy and I was\u2026..with the hunters and the lawyers and Aunt Madge calling for our help. It wasn\u2019t the right time, I didn\u2019t want to burden you with that knowledge, that a werewolf you\u2019d never met before saw you as their mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLeaving here was a chance to take a break,\u201d Talia continued, comfortably filling in Derek\u2019s pauses. \u201cGive Derek a chance to center himself again, and give you time to grow so that one day he could meet and court you properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut then I became the Alpha.\u201d Derek sighed, as if his status were a burden he was still learning to shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Talia hummed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as we\u2019d planned, but honestly things rarely are. It is a difficult thing, to claim the mantle of Alpha from a kill. In peaceful times, the power is given and received with love, the old Alpha passing on the leadership of a pack to the intended wolf, usually their second. A status taken in violence, especially into one who was not appropriately prepared to receive it, can be a terrible shock to the system. Emotions are heightened, instincts become almost impossibly loud. The best way to ease this is by quickly establishing a pack. His sister, and some of my Betas who were closest to Derek rallied around him, but he needed land, a territory, to settle the wolf inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou signed over the land to him, but that wasn\u2019t enough, he needed to be on it.\u201d Stiles deduced from what little details he\u2019s scrapped together before.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery clever. Yes,\u201d She agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to hold the deed, a wolf must roam their land to know that it is their own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took him to the courthouse to sign the boundaries paperwork, to show him how it was done. But you didn\u2019t tell my dad he was an Alpha yet. Nobody even knew you were back besides the people that were there that day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s when it went to hell.\u201d Derek scowled as he looked at Stiles, but it was clearly self-intended.</p>\n<p>\u201cI blame myself for more than a little share of it.\u201d Talia said regretfully. \u201cI should have known he was having trouble with the change, but Derek has always been masterful at suffering in silence, and when he told me he was fine, with everything going on I was a little too eager to believe him. I was careless, I thought it would be enough if we brought some of his new pack along, to support him. I\u2019m afraid it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI smelled you again, on your father\u2019s clothes and it was all I could do not to shift. Then we left and it was like suddenly I could smell you everywhere, on the wind. It had been years, but I could hear your voice, blocks away, getting closer, and the only thing I could think of was finding you. They barely managed to get me home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had thought it might best if we brought you two together right away, give Derek a chance to court you. That maybe with a pack and land and the opportunity for a normal interaction with his mate, the burden of his instincts would ease some.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201c Stiles interjected, \u201cHe pitched a self-sacrificing fit about my being too young even though he didn\u2019t actually know how old I was. Right?\u201d He turned on Derek. \u201cYou could have just accidentally on purpose bumped into me at a coffee shop and introduced yourself to find out if I was jailbait or not. And then maybe you could have asked me out on a date like a functioning adult. That would have worked out for you, Derek! Because- and I cannot state this strongly enough- I, Stiles Stillinski, first of his name, would have said yes to <em>anything</em> you\u2019d asked of me in a heartbeat. Phone number, pint of blood, social security number? All of it. You would have had more trouble getting me to stop following you around screaming \u2018DIBS!\u2019 at everyone in a ten-foot radius. The only reason I\u2019m not doing it now is because these people are your family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Derek,\u201d Talia cooed, deeply amused. \u201cHe\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mom</em>,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve grasped the general shape of things,\u201d Talia ignored her son. \u201cHe was being stubborn, but as one Alpha to the next, I had to respect his choice. We returned north, with no plans to hurry the transition, but he\u2026\u2026it happened so fast. A few days back and he could barely control his shift, he became erratic, wild. I knew what was happening but by then it was too late to stop it. We tried to contain him but he broke free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was like\u2026.\u201d The tips of Derek\u2019s claws extended then slid back from the memory. \u201cThe farther away I got from you, the worse it became. You were miles away, and anything could happen to you, you could get hurt or someone else could\u2026.could\u2026.stake a claim and my wolf refused to let go until I had you. It was all I could think about. There\u2019s this whole chunk of time that\u2019s just a- a blur of running and hunting and searching for you like an animal until that night. Lost and roaming my territory and then you were there, like a gift, like you-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles wrapped his arms around Derek, resting his head on the man\u2019s muscular shoulder at his distress. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine now. We found each other, and I\u2019m not going anywhere because you clearly can\u2019t live without me.\u201d Derek\u2019s deep chuckle rumbling against the side of Stiles\u2019 face. They held each other tighter.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>After a time, Talia sent Derek off to the rest of the pack. It was clear he was unhappy about leaving his mate\u2019s side, but he turned and slipped out of the door when Stiles gave him a reassuring wink. He was feeling much more comfortable around Talia. Wolves were still new, but moms he knew how to handle and at the end of the day, that\u2019s all she was, a mother looking out for her son.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, he has so much to learn about running a pack. And now with you...Derek is\u2026.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSelf-sacrificing is probably the most tactful way of putting it. He has never been forthright when he wanted something, and after Kate, he fears that anything he might want, anything that might make him happy, he doesn\u2019t deserve. He\u2019ll lock it away until it tears him apart, as you now well know. Be patient with him. Don\u2019t let him close down. He\u2019s a good person, he deserves to be happy and I think that, more than anyone, you could give him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles felt his chest constrict, a little overwhelmed. \u201cI want that. I wanna\u2026do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Way to be articulate Stiles. Talia squeezed his hand with a relieved smile all the same.</p>\n<p>Lunch with an extended wolf pack turned out to be not so much a real live nature documentary as opposed to a high precision military operation. Stiles found himself passed along a rapidly moving line, a plate shoved in his hands and filled and then overfilled before he even got a handle on what room he was in. The yard was packed with picnic tables and fold out chairs and screaming children snaking through the maze of adults eating and laughing and yelling over one another. When he finally stumbled onto the lawn, dazed and self-conscious at all the eyes turning as one on him, Stiles began to wonder what it said that this was far more intimidating to him than running through the woods with a feral Alpha on his heels. God, it felt like lunch time on the first day of high school all over again, except this time, instead of Scott waving him over to the seat he\u2019d saved him, Derek Hale strode down the center aisle, trailing wolf whistles and catcalls in his wake as he moved to rescue his mate.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he lowed into Stiles\u2019 ear, one hand sneaking around his waist to pull him in close, the other taking Stiles\u2019 plate with careful ease. \u201cI want you to meet my sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve met your sister.\u201d Stiles snarked, painfully aware of every evaluating head that turned as they passed by. \u201cAnd she is <em>delightful</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stopped short and laughed. A loud, jovial peal that shook them both as he still hadn\u2019t let go of Stiles. The entire company hushed, and behind them, a woman burst into quiet tears. Derek rolled his eyes, still grinning down at Stiles, and guided him over to a table occupied by Cora and another dark-haired woman that had to be the other sister.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Stiles hissed at Derek as they sat down, panicked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to insult your family! Are they insulted? I should have warned you, I get really sarcastic when I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo honey, they just haven\u2019t heard Derek laugh in\u2026.in years.\u201d The older woman patted Stiles\u2019 hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Gayle cries over everything.\u201d Derek said as he tucked in close to Stiles\u2019 side. \u201cYou get used to it. This is Laura, she\u2019s my older sister and mom\u2019s second. And, of course, you know Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, I remember you.\u201d Stiles snapped his fingers as if trying to recall. \u201cFrom the uhhhh..\u2026torture dungeon, right? How\u2019s that going by the way, find anyone new to stalk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019ve tried,\u201d Cora batted her eyes in a mockery of pitiful disappointment. \u201cBut it's just so hard to catch the scent of decent prey when every acre of Beacon Hills smells like the two of you rutting. Good job by the way Derek, very thorough. The family\u2019s impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles made a highly undignified sound, going pale when he looked around at the gathering and noticed more than a few amused looks turned their way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get used to that, too.\u201d Derek shrugged, expression flat but a glint of mischief in his eyes. He wrapped a bulky arm around Stiles and pulled him closer still, holding him there as he shoveled food into his mouth.</p>\n<p>A tall, Asian man that looked like he should be a fitness model appeared next to the table, each arm clutching a squirming baby. \u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d he told Laura as he handed her the children one at a time. She kissed the first before passing it off to Cora, took the second one and leaned up to accept a quick kiss from her mate who dropped down next to her at the table and began to demolish the plate of food Laura passed him with an exhausted grunt.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Ron,\u201d Laura nudged the man\u2019s shoulder and he paused just long enough to nod at Stiles. \u201cAnd these two little peanuts are Livy and Dev.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid she might try to eat the baby?\u201d Stiles raised an eyebrow at Cora, who turned the infant in her lap and used its chubby little arms to give him an Italian Salute.</p>\n<p>\u201cHA,\u201d Laura barked, shifting a grabby Dev to her other side. \u201cYou are gonna have your hands full with this pack, Der. And he hasn\u2019t even met Erica yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>That actually gave him pause. \u201cHow long do you think I could stall that?\u201d Derek put down his fork to pinch the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">oOo</p>\n<p>As lunch wound down, Stiles watched as the pack moved in unconscious unison to clear everything away, a small group of them already talking about dinner as they headed to the kitchen to get started. Stiles tried get up to help, but Derek tugged him back down and nodded at Cora. She sighed with as much dramatic irritation as she could, then rose to gather up the plates of her Alpha and his mate. Other wolves trickled over, too, offering coffee, water, desert.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerks,\u201d Derek shrugged when Stiles turned a stunned expression on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get her to do my laundry?\u201d He asked as Cora bussed away the next round of glasses and plates.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could try, but you might wind up with claw marks in everything you own. Come on, want to show you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Things were much more peaceful in the main house with everyone fed and scattered. Stiles followed Derek upstairs to a familiar door. The room, however, was almost unrecognizable. None of the old, clawed up furniture remained. The walls had been plastered over and painted a soft white, the floors totally redon in warm gold wood. A huge bed with grey and tan linens dominated one side of the bedroom, the other side outfitted with a fireplace, a small white sofa and thick sheepskin rugs. Everything was bright and clean and inviting looking and Stiles could hardly believe this was the same space where he\u2019d become Derek\u2019s mate in a dirty nest of his own clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get your own house flipping show, I can\u2019t believe how fast you got all this done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Derek crossed his arms over his chest, looking around at his handiwork as if still unsatisfied. \u201cIt\u2019s for you, you know. I mean\u2026.I had this whole place fixed up so it would be ready for you.\u201d From the drawer of a bedside table, Derek fished something out, walking over to Stiles and offering it up in the palm of his hand.</p>\n<p>A house key. Tied in a little red bow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to move in right now. Although, if you wanted to I\u2019d be\u2014I want you to move in. Someday, after college, next week\u2026.whenever you\u2019re ready. Or never, if that\u2019s not what you want, but I want you to have a home here. I want to <em>be</em> your home, like you\u2019re already mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles squeezed the key in his hand, the teeth biting into his palm and chasing some of the burn out of his eyes. Wrapping his arms around Derek\u2019s neck, Stiles stood on his tip toes and kissed the wolf for all he was worth, groaning into it when it immediately turned filthy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne question,\u201d He panted as he pulled away, lips red-wet and cheeks flushed a high pink. \u201cWill you be insulted if I put this on a Wolverine keychain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek growled playfully as he hauled Stiles up by the hips, \u201cI\u2019m <em>much</em> bigger than Wolverine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs as he wraps himself around Derek\u2019s towering bulk, \u201cYeah you are. And I love you just a little more because you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He yelled happily when they bounced onto the bed, Derek\u2019s huge body caging him in. \u201cYou love me?\u201d Looking down at Stiles with the edge of a smile curling his lips. His fingers were too fast to counter as they unbuttoned Stiles shirt and pants, shoving off the fabric and tossing everything over the side of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! You know we can\u2019t do this here, every wolf in northern California is downstairs!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoundproofed bedroom, remember?\u201d Derek grumbled into the skin of Stiles\u2019 throat, already working on another purple mark. He shoved a hand under the pillow beside Stiles\u2019 head, drawing out a bottle of lube.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrepared, I see.\u201d Stiles gasped, one of Derek\u2019s thick fingers slick and breaching him. Good Lord this guy could move fast. Two fingers, three, Stiles rocked down on Derek\u2019s hand while biting his own lip. \u201cThey\u2019ll smell it on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant that,\u201d he was already unzipping his pants, shoving them down impatiently to draw out that magnificent Alpha cock that left Stiles paralyzed with want. \u201cGotta get inside you right now, baby. Gonna fuck you and knot you up tight and then they\u2019ll all know you\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey already know tha- <em>hat</em>!\u201d Stiles stuttered as Derek didn\u2019t waste a second hiking up his leg and shoving inside in one long push.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Derek moaned. And fuck he sounded as desperate as he looked. \u201cAlways want you like this, missed you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you, too.\u201d Was the last thing Stiles managed to say before Derek let go, holding Stiles down and ramming into him in heavy, possessive strokes. His eyes flared red, fangs peeking out and retreating more than once. Stiles really, really hoped Derek was right about the soundproofed walls because there was no way he could stay quiet as Derek did his best to fuck him into a coma. He could barely get any leverage, forced to hold onto what he could as Derek pounded into his willing body, snarling a litany of <em>mate</em> and <em>mine</em> over and over with every thrust. The knot began to catch, the two of them so close and needing it, needing some confirmation that the distance was closed, that they were unquestionably joined and that the days apart were finally over.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Derek all but roared. \u201cTake my knot and <em>come</em>.\u201d He shoved in one more time, the flared girth stretching Stiles open before slotting into place snugly inside him. And as if his body knew no other way to react than to comply, Stiles came screaming, convulsing and sweating as Derek drew his own orgasm out with rough little thrusts of his hips. Stiles shuddered from head to toe, limp limbs splaying out as Derek sat back on his heels, dragging Stiles hips with him to rest in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Stiles slurred, bleary eyed at Derek as the man stared down at their laps with laser guided focus.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to watch you speared on my knot.\u201d Holding Stiles\u2019 hips in both hands he ground deeper inside, groaning when it pulled out another jet of come. \u201cYou look perfect like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a caveman,\u201d Stiles laughed, groaning when it tugged deliciously where they were joined. He stretched out, getting comfortable, when he noticed something red peeking from under one of the pillows. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait- \u201c Derek started, then groaned as another tiny orgasm hit him. Stiles pulled at the bit of fabric, his red hoodie- his completely trashed, clawed up, filthy red hoodie- unfurled across the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a <em>sentimental</em> caveman!\u201d Stiles teased. \u201cBut seriously, we need to burn this thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to\u2026it\u2026.\u201dDerek Hale blushing while balls deep in Stiles\u2019 ass was a kind of adorable Stiles didn\u2019t know existed. \u201cIt smells like you. Like us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, then how about we wash it at least, and then I can wear it while you chase me around the room and pin me down and make it smell like us all over again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes flared red, his voice an octave lower and deadly serious, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell ok then,\u201d Stiles licked his lips and tugged his mate down on top of him. This man was his mate. It still didn\u2019t even seem possible that he could be so lucky. He kissed the sharp line of both Derek\u2019s cheeks, suddenly ferociously determined never to let anything hurt this man again. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t joking before. I really do love you, my big bad wolf.\u201d</p>"
