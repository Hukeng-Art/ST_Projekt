  "notes": "<p>Should be noted up front that this is truly\u2026.the most frankencanon of frankencanons. For plot events, it mostly (emphasis: mostly) follows the novel timeline, but I pulled quite a few scenes, characterizations, etc. that I liked from CQL and the donghua, and omitted other sequences for the sake of not absolutely imploding trying to write around how massive the canon is (just for one example like, the archery competition, as much as I love it, rip). Also: I love the slow build of WWX coming to understand his sexuality in the novel, but for the sake of canon timeline when this fic is set (pre-timeskip), he\u2019s a little more self-aware in that regard.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my peerless betas: Mel, Em, and Kelsey.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>[update] there's a brief mention of switching in the epilogue chapter. please stop sending me harassment about it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!! ;; Comments and kudos always welcome!</p>\n<p>You can find me: <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/occultings\" rel=\"nofollow\">twt</a> | <a href=\"https://microcomets.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a> | <a href=\"https://wanlangji.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cql/mdzs blog</a></p>",
  "text": "<p align=\"center\">\n<u> <b>PART I.</b> </u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is eight years old when the red thread first appears on his wrist.</p>\n<p>It happens when he is practicing calligraphy in the lanshi, silent alongside the other students. As part of this week\u2019s classwork, he and the other disciples his age must copy the Lan sect rules a hundred times each until shufu approves their penmanship, then recite them out loud from rote memory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is when Lan Zhan is copying the fifty-second sect rule that the new addition to his wrist hooks his attention.</p>\n<p>Running is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses, and Lan Zhan is very, very good at following the rules, so when class finally ends, he does not sprint to his brother\u2019s quarters. He walks very, very quickly, his heart pounding sickly in his chest the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u201cGege,\u201d he says when he enters, and he means to explain what\u2019s happened in a manner that\u2019s detailed and controlled, but his voice chokes off and all he can do is wordlessly hold up his wrist, where the scarlet thread is a visible brand for anyone to see. He had tried pulling it off, of course, but his fingers had slipped right through the string, over and over. The pale inner skin of his wrist is scratched red from his efforts.</p>\n<p>Lan Huan pauses in the middle of organizing his scrolls; his eyes widen at the sight of his wrist. \u201cDidi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I,\u201d Lan Zhan says helplessly. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Huan abandons his task, rounds the desk to cross over to Lan Zhan as he appraises his expression with concern. \u201cA-Zhan, you are...not pleased?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Lan Zhan bursts out as Lan Huan stops in front of him. Louder than is well-mannered. His voice breaks a little over the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lan Huan asks, in calm and soothing tones; only twelve years old, but he still exudes a practiced paternity that Lan Zhan has never questioned. \u201cHaving a thread is something to celebrate, no? A red thread only means that someone in the world is your intended person.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at him, his shoulders drooping and a crumpling feeling in his chest. \u201cI do not...want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>A slight frown pulls at Lan Huan\u2019s brow as he asks again, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be married,\u201d Lan Zhan insists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this age, he knows he is still considered a child, but he is not so young that he does not know himself. His effect on others. The degree to which he values his uninterrupted space. The thought of forcibly sharing himself with another is alien and arresting, like being unexpectedly thrown into Cold Spring.</p>\n<p>From Lan Huan comes the expected response. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to know that, didi. When you\u2019re older, matters like marriage will make more sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Lan Zhan says stubbornly. \u201cI hear what the elders say.\u201d He has seen his father\u2019s coal-black shackle, the colder black of his eyes. \u201cI know the red thread\u2019s love is a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Lan Huan protests, his frown deepening. \u201cLove is a very good thing. A-Zhan, why do you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lan Zhan thinks of love, he thinks of frostbitten knees, a closed door, the saltwater press of stifled tears. He thinks of his father, his empty eyes and his long sleeves. When he thinks of marriage, he thinks of the tired lines crowded around his mother\u2019s eyes, already fading from his memory. He thinks of her house, beautifully adorned and empty.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan does not say anything in reply to his brother, just bunches his fists by his sides. Lan Huan steps closer to him and drops a light hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn any case, your soulmate thread won\u2019t matter until years from now,\u201d Lan Huan says placatingly. \u201cTry not to think about it, okay? Soon you\u2019ll get used to seeing it, and you won\u2019t think about it at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Among the cultivation sects and beyond, the soulmate threads are a shared and common knowledge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like anyone else, Lan Zhan has known the colors well from a very young age, and has even seen a few on the wrists of his sect peers \u2014 light and faint, but nonetheless visible. Blue for a familial soulmate. Silver for a friend. Red for a lover.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red threads are rare in the Lan sect, but always a communal source of intrigue in the instances when they do appear \u2014 a combination of the GusuLan\u2019s characteristic, tight-lipped disapproval about such matters and a natural but grudging curiosity. Red threads without fail draw hushed speculation, no matter what the sect rules dictate about gossiping.</p>\n<p>No one speaks of the black thread. In their limited visits, his father had always donned long, draping sleeves, so Lan Wangji had only caught a glimpse of it twice, charred into his wrist like a shackle. He had known, even from a young age, that the black thread is the worst kind of sentence: a physical and permanent reminder that a soulmate is beyond where they can ever be reached again.</p>\n<p>Later that evening, lying straight-backed on his bed, Lan Zhan holds his wrist up against his paper lantern, studies the blue spider crawl of his veins nested in the orange backlight of his skin \u2014 and the red thread. So far, he\u2019s noticed that it sometimes fades from view when he twists his wrist, as though shifting in and out of existence with different sources of light.</p>\n<p>He had tried ripping it off with his fingers, with his teeth, but perhaps it\u2019s not quite so physical as that. He has only recently started his cultivation lessons, but the elders have informed him, rather proudly, that his golden core is unusually strong for his age. So Lan Zhan closes his eyes and reaches out with the beating ember of his qi.</p>\n<p>With his spiritual energy, Lan Zhan plucks at the thread like a guqin string. He feels it hum, then vibrate out into the vanishing silence, meeting only emptiness.</p>\n<p>Then, after another still moment, he feels the thread tug on the other end, an unmistakable response. Almost a gentle tease. As if someone is saying, <em> Hello to you too. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan does not touch the thread from that night onward. Unfortunately, this means little to the person on the other end, who tugs at the thread constantly, now that this new trick has been revealed to them. Annoying, insistent, almost like they\u2019re trying to exhaust a response out of him. His person does not discriminate based on time of day, either \u2014 the string is tugged during morning classes, during his midday guqin practice, during his afternoon cultivation training, during silent mealtime in the evening, during his pre-sleep rituals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the end of the first week, Lan Zhan has ground his teeth so much that a permanent ache has taken up residence in his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cGege,\u201d he says to Lan Huan after that first week. It is not a whine \u2014\u00a0he does not whine. Excessive complaining is prohibited. \u201cHe will not leave me alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Huan blinks, as though startled, then looks at Lan Zhan with a complicated expression. He asks, a little carefully, \u201cDidi knows that it is a boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s teeth click shut, and blood rushes to his face, a sudden roar in his ears. He had not. Meant to say that. He doesn\u2019t know why his automatic assumption is that his person is a boy. It\u2019s just that whenever he pictures the figure on the other end, it\u2019s a boy\u2019s face, bright eyes and a taunting, roguish grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and flounders more.</p>\n<p>Lan Huan rushes to end his flustered silence. \u201cI was only curious, A-Zhan. I didn\u2019t know if the person on the other end had done something that let you know their gender.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hesitates, then says, \u201cNo,\u201d and Lan Huan smoothly lets the subject drop, but Lan Zhan can\u2019t shake the lingering, mortified sense for days after the conversation that \u2014 based on Lan Huan\u2019s startled reaction, how quickly he had tried to mask his surprise \u2014 he\u2019s revealed something damning about himself. Something he perhaps <em> is </em>too young to fully understand the implications of.</p>\n<p>It could be a girl, couldn\u2019t it? The red thread is for\u2026lovers, after all, Lan Zhan reminds himself with a cringe. Thus far, he has only seen marriage between men and women in his sect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only that, for whatever reason, Lan Zhan cannot picture a girl on the other end, teasingly tugging his string. He does not know many girls \u2014 the men and women are educated separately in the Cloud Recesses, so he does not know how girls behave. Maybe that\u2019s why he can\u2019t picture it being a girl. That must be it. He will explain it to gege later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t long at all before his sect peers notice the new addition to his wrist, before the whispers follow him like a hush of rainfall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a ripple of wildfire, the elders know within days. One visits him in his quarters to give him a stern lecture on the importance of discipline and restraint, on the significance of his headband, how he must guard his heart closely and his carnal desires even moreso.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods obediently but thinks, through the entire conversation, <em> I am eight years old.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Sometimes, he can\u2019t shake the sense, when the elders are looking at him, that they are imagining his father in his stead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the months pass \u2014 and in a slow trickle, the years \u2014 the hourly string-tugging abates, much to Lan Zhan\u2019s fierce relief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, one ritual remains. Every night before hai shi, as Lan Zhan moves through his nightly rituals for sleep \u2014 meditating, undressing, bathing, combing his hair, untying his ribbon \u2014 there\u2019s a small but unmistakable tug at his wrist. Almost as if the other person is aware of his sleep schedule and is saying good night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much against his will, Lan Zhan comes to anticipate it: the tiny thrill of knowing someone else is out there, an unknown face in an unknown place, thinking of him. He spends his days alone, but that small, tethering pull each night is a strange comfort.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while, he tugs back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, when he\u2019s thirteen, the tugging stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan does not tug, not wanting to impose on the person at the other end, but the anxiety of this absence consumes him, enough so that after a few weeks of the silence, he asks his xiongzhang, as they quietly share tea, if it\u2019s possible something had happened to his person.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your thread still red?\u201d Lan Xichen asks, and Lan Zhan hesitates, then nods. \u201cThen they should be okay. If they were gone from this world, your thread would turn black.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re both growing up, Lan Zhan reasons, as he tries to fall asleep that night. Although he does not know anything about this person, he thinks that they may be close to his age. Maybe his person had decided the tugging was a childish ritual, or had grown bored of Lan Zhan\u2019s intermittent responses and stopped. Maybe his person had forgotten about him.</p>\n<p>Despite himself, Lan Zhan can\u2019t help but house in his chest the new loneliness of these nights.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s fifteen, mere days before he receives his courtesy name, Lan Zhan\u2019s father dies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s grief around it is curiously empty, lake-smooth. A hollow mouth in his chest. He feels sad about his father\u2019s passing because he is expected to, rather than that he misses someone he hardly knew. The truth of the matter is that he had known his father far more from sect lore than from personal interaction.</p>\n<p>The week of the funeral passes in a blur, a collection of observations and images as slippery as water: A pearl-white banner draped over his father\u2019s house. The cloy of incense and joss paper burning. The tomb-like silence as he had knelt in vigil, for hours, by his father\u2019s stiff, silent body. The crimson red of the thread on Lan Zhan\u2019s wrist, a disrespectful streak of color against his white mourning robes. Too glaringly cheery for current events. He keeps it tucked away, out of sight, inside his sleeve.</p>\n<p>The night after the funeral finally ends, as he waits for sleep, Lan Zhan tugs the string. Silence. He tugs again, and again, in a sudden desperate need to know his soulmate is there, still alive.</p>\n<p>He waits for a long time with his breath caged tight in his lungs, staring wide-eyed and awake at the gingko-shaped indigo patterns on his ceiling before he starts to drift, his body succumbing to exhaustion.</p>\n<p>Right before he drops off, he feels it, the gentlest pull at his wrist. It\u2019s possible that he dreams it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only months later, the Cloud Recesses are in a flurry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, <em> flurry </em>may be too strong of a word for the reserved movements of Lan disciples, but there\u2019s a suppressed, anxious energy in the air as Lan Wangji\u2019s sect prepares accommodations to host other young disciples for the annual guest lecture. It\u2019s the first year that Lan Wangji himself will be able to participate in classes, to mingle with disciples from other sects.</p>\n<p>He is not looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will be a good opportunity for you, Wangji,\u201d his xiongzhang tries to encourage him after the silence of their evening meal. \u201cYou spend far too much time alone. This ge is starting to worry about you. It will be nice to meet other disciples your age, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d is all Lan Wangji says. He does not want xiongzhang to worry over him for ridiculous reasons, so he will try. Unhappily, but he will.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night before the first day of lecture, a delinquent breaks into the Cloud Recesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Lan Wangji has been trained as disciplinarian for the past year, and he excels exceptionally in this role, so he catches the boy red-handed with little effort.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t truly be so unforgiving to an honored guest, would you?\u201d the boy is saying as Lan Wangji holds him at swordpoint. He\u2019s a talker. Clearly accustomed to charming his way out of situations, earnest white flashes of teeth, wheedling tones, smiling eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very lucky for his sect that Lan Wangji is impervious to being swayed. Anyone else might have let this reprobate go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have already broken four of our rules,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, unmoved. \u201cIs that the behavior of an honored guest?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy has the gall to pout at him, as though he doesn\u2019t have a blade pointed to his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan-gongzi,\u201d the boy says, his lower lip still slightly jutted. It would be a nearly endearing expression, to anyone who was not Lan Wangji. \u201cHow am I supposed to know your rules? In my Jiang sect, offering liquor would be taken as a sign of friendship. How was I to know that I\u2019d be <em> punished </em>for my generosity?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not buy a word out of this boy\u2019s mouth. But it\u2019s good to know he\u2019s from the YunmengJiang sect. He will keep a close watch on its disciples from here on, especially this boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will accompany me to receive punishment,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and sheathes Bichen when it becomes apparent the boy won\u2019t attack him. \u201cPerhaps then you will have a firmer understanding of the guest etiquette here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d the boy replies. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d And he takes off with a wild laugh, flying to the next rooftop. Lan Wangji is momentarily stunned by the sheer audacity of it before he gives chase.</p>\n<p>They spar on the next two roofs, and Lan Wangji is infuriated, a little amazed to find his strikes matched blow for blow, interspersed with effortless grins from the boy through the clash of their swords \u2014 like he\u2019s <em> enjoying </em>this. The boy\u2019s style is markedly different from his own, a Jiang form of fighting, but he adapts to the Lan style with unflappable ease, picking up the forms by the second.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, your skills are formidable, Lan-gongzi,\u201d the boy calls over the sharp clang of steel. \u201cWho is it that I have the honor of fighting with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rips away from him, embarrassed to find he\u2019s heaving for breath. The boy is as well, and the playful lilt to his features remains, but he watches Lan Wangji with a closer interest than before, not so dismissive. Despite himself, Lan Wangji\u2019s heart gallops faster in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, courtesy name Wangji,\u201d Lan Wangji replies coolly. He doesn\u2019t often pull rank to gain an upper hand, but he\u2019s angry and a little put out, so he feels rewarded by the slight widening of the boy\u2019s eyes as he recognizes the name.</p>\n<p>Then the boy\u2019s mouth curls up, brushing the edge of condescending, and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was in the presence of Lan royalty, Lan <em> er-</em>gongzi.\u201d In an exaggerated, sweeping motion, he salutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s outrageously disrespectful, given Lan Wangji\u2019s title and status. Lan Wangji\u2019s fist tightens around Bichen.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who do I have the pleasure of reporting?\u201d Lan Wangji asks through his teeth, and ignores the strange flip-flop in his chest when the boy throws his head back and laughs with genuine mirth.</p>\n<p>The boy is pretty. It\u2019s a fact, an objectively true one, that should not register or matter, and it makes Lan Wangji angrier when the conscious thought crosses his mind, but the truth of it cannot be denied. The boy is pretty, and he knows it, and he uses it to his advantage in situations such as this one, and Lan Wangji will not be charmed or swayed by it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, courtesy name Wuxian,\u201d the boy answers with a wide, moonlit smile. \u201cYunmengJiang\u2019s head disciple, if you\u2019d like to write that in your report.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks. That explains the boy\u2019s aptitude with a sword. But does the Jiang sect really allow someone so undisciplined and irreverent to lead its disciples? Is the boy lying?</p>\n<p>Lying or not, Lan Wangji silences him, dumps his liquor, and drags him to meet shufu and xiongzhang in the hanshi. The boy, Wei Wuxian, pitches a fit the entire time; he sulks when he\u2019s reprimanded, casts about wildly as he retells the events of the evening to his uncle and brother. Mutinous. Bratty. Too loud, exaggerated, talks too much. Lan Wangji cannot stand him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is given a punishment in the library, a standard assignment of repeated rule-copying. It\u2019s completely unfathomable to Lan Wangji, but the boy seems to have recovered his good cheer by the end of the conversation, brightly bidding Lan Wangji a good night as he scampers off to find his siblings\u2019 quarters. As if nothing from the past shichen had just happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a good feeling about that Wei-gongzi,\u201d xiongzhang tells Lan Wangji moments later with a serene, almost mischievous expression, and Lan Wangji is shocked speechless. He storms off to the jingshi, too indignant to indulge whatever <em> ridiculous </em>potential that his brother imagines he sees in the Jiang boy.</p>\n<p>That night, as Lan Wangji tries to fall asleep, he scowls at his ceiling, his muscles still too tense from the events of the evening, from their sparring. He thinks about how Wei Wuxian had looked silenced and on his knees, his mouth twisted and his brows pulled together. About the mercurial dance of his moods, from cheerily bright to hotly indignant to childishly sullen, each a performance on his expressive face.</p>\n<p>Who does he think he is? Lan Wangji wonders to himself in a quiet rage, and he suddenly feels a pull at his wrist. He holds up his arm and blinks at the thread, certain that he\u2019s mistaken. It\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s heard from his person, since his father\u2019s funeral, but sure enough, the tugging starts up again, insistent and almost obnoxious.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji isn\u2019t sure whether to be more pleased or annoyed at this development.</p>\n<p>He tugs back once, sharp, as if to say, <em> Shut up.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>It is far past his bedtime, after all.</p>\n<p>Three quick tugs from the other person, a petulant cajoling. <em> Pay attention to meee.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>With a brief spasm of horror, Lan Wangji realizes he\u2019d heard the silent plea in Wei Wuxian\u2019s whiny, wheedling voice.</p>\n<p>Of course that wretched boy would ruin this part of his evening, too. Lan Wangji slips into a furious meditation, blocking out all other sensations until the tugging finally goes away, like the person had either fallen asleep or given up. Eventually, Lan Wangji, too, drifts off into a fitful, restless sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As to be expected, Wei Wuxian starts causing problems in the Cloud Recesses almost right away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes two days for him to be thrown out of lecture for suggesting alternative, unorthodox cultivation methods. Two days for Lan Wangji to watch his uncle turn a sickly shade of violet that he has, in his entire life, been yet to witness. Two days for Lan Wangji to be saddled with the unenviable \u2014 but grimly necessary \u2014 task of rehabilitating Wei Wuxian\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries to sneak off to the back mountain before his first afternoon of punishment. When Lan Wangji searches for him, he finds Wei Wuxian in the middle of wrangling with a poor, helpless pheasant. Lan Wangji physically drags him to the library pavilion as Wei Wuxian whines in his ear the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a brute, Lan er-gongzi,\u201d Wei Wuxian sniffs at Lan Wangji when he takes up a seated position at one of the desks in the library. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know your gentlemanly reputation is nothing but a huge farce.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Lan Wangji says icily.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flashes him a grin across the library, a shaft of sunlight bouncing off water. \u201cOr what? You\u2019ll silence me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and digs his nose into his book to ignore Wei Wuxian\u2019s grunting and moaning.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, Wei Wuxian stays quiet as he grinds ink and starts on his task, but of course it doesn\u2019t last. Not even a quarter shichen after, Wei Wuxian wanders across the library to sit next to Lan Wangji\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji-xiong,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, tugging at his sleeve.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji ignores him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d Wei Wuxian tries again.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pictures a clear, undisturbed cold spring. He envisions sinking into its silent, glacial depths.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian chirps, too loud, and Lan Wangji does flinch at this, the shock of over-familiarity in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a self-satisfied curl of his lips as Lan Wangji turns to glare at him. It\u2019s the first time Lan Wangji has been so close to him. The bow of his mouth is rosebud-pink, very plush. His eyes are gray, glinting with mischief. Quick and lively, like sun catching the silver backs of darting minnows. Lan Wangji returns to reading, ignoring the observations.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr would you prefer Lan er-gege?\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders aloud, and walks two fingers along the desk toward Lan Wangji\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji silences him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gives a stifled groan of protest and reaches out again, spreading his fingers wide and placing his hand directly on Lan Wangji\u2019s scroll to stop him reading. Very obnoxious, and Lan Wangji almost slaps him away, but the motion causes Wei Wuxian\u2019s sleeve to slip, and Lan Wangji blinks, momentarily arrested by what he sees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A faint but unmistakable red thread.</p>\n<p>He lifts the silencing spell and does smack Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand away, then swivels to stare at him. Wei Wuxian harrumphs at him and cradles his hand close to his chest with a petulant expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wrist,\u201d Lan Wangji says \u2014 unable to stop himself from asking, or to keep the grudging curiosity from his voice. In his whole life, he\u2019s had yet to meet someone else his age who has the red thread.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, and squints at him. Then he blinks in realization. \u201cOh! You mean this?\u201d</p>\n<p>He peels his sleeve back and holds his wrist up, where the red thread pulses against his tan skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cRed,\u201d Lan Wangji says, still angry with Wei Wuxian, but the question in his tone unmistakable.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies with a bright smile, seeming eager to have finally captured Lan Wangji\u2019s attention. \u201cIt means that I\u2019ll get to fall in love one day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks again, then scowls. \u201cRidiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s ridiculous?\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cThat\u2019s what it means! Don\u2019t tell me you Lans don\u2019t have red threads here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Lan Wangji says coldly, and leaves it at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s nice,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rocking his bent-up knee back and forth. He sucks on his lower lip thoughtfully before he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s romantic. It means that I\u2019m meant to love somebody out in the world, and they\u2019re guaranteed to love me in return.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hot, squirming pressure building in Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. The heat of it creeps to his ears and steadily burns. How can Wei Wuxian listen to himself talk this way? It\u2019s absurd.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that face for, Wangji-xiong?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, tilting his head to survey him. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in soulmates?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, irritated. The existence of soulmate threads is an irrefutable fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in romance, then,\u201d Wei Wuxian tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fiction, perhaps,\u201d Lan Wangji says coolly. \u201cMany other matters take precedence over love.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s well aware he\u2019s saying too much, being lured out into this conversation like a wary mouse as Wei Wuxian circles him like a smug cat. He finds, for whatever reason, that he cannot stop himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wow, </em>you Lans are so boring,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies, sounding appalled. \u201cSo vapid and stuffy! What\u2019s the point of anything if not for love?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him, utterly taken aback. Wei Wuxian meets his gaze, earnest and a little challenging. He really believes what he\u2019s saying, not just spouting shameless nonsense for the sake of annoying Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a teasing hook of Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips, and Lan Wangji at once senses danger.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slithers closer to him, leaning forward on Lan Wangji\u2019s desk on both of his elbows.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d he says in a low, silken voice, \u201ccould it be that Lan er-gongzi is jealous he doesn\u2019t have a red thread?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps, flinching away from his proximity. Too close, too warm \u2014 he wants to flee, to unsheathe his sword and fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can only imagine what your soulmate would be like, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says laughingly, a shimmer of sound close to his ear. \u201cOh, god, there\u2019d be two of you in the world. <em> That </em> I would like to see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t know why he does what he does next; there\u2019s something about Wei Wuxian that makes him desperate to grapple for the upper hand, in a childish, immature way he\u2019s never experienced. For that reason, he yanks back his sleeve and holds up his wrist, and feels a vicious tug of satisfaction to see the surprise register on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Ji-xiong?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks with a startled blink. \u201cHuh. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><em>There</em>, Lan Wangji wants to say, smugly. <em> That will teach you to think you know anything about me.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWow, your soulmate is gonna be so <em> bored,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian says, then starts laughing, too loud and unbridled for general tolerance, but <em> especially </em>for the observant silence of the library pavilion. Lan Wangji glares at him, seething with outrage.</p>\n<p>Finally, Wei Wuxian leans out of his space, yawning with a creak in his jaw, an appealing flex of his jawline. Abruptly, Lan Wangji remembers that Wei Wuxian still has several lines of precepts to copy. He\u2019s allowed himself to be goaded as he told himself he wouldn\u2019t, letting himself become unforgivably distracted from his task.</p>\n<p>Just as Lan Wangji is about to tell him off, Wei Wuxian asks, consideringly, \u201cWhat do you think your soulmate is like, Lan Zhan?\u201d and the line of inquiry brings Lan Wangji up short.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know anything about them?\u201d Wei Wuxian continues.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns. He reflects on the years of teasing tugs, his own furious despair over it as a child.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlayful,\u201d he says before he can stop himself. \u201cLoyal.\u201d The person had pulled his thread every night, after all, even when there was often no reply. \u201cPersistent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, looking a little surprised to be answered. \u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just do,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps, and returns to staring unseeingly at his scroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about mine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says mournfully, either oblivious or uncaring to Lan Wangji\u2019s lack of attention. \u201cI think she must be quieter than me, though. More...subdued.\u201d</p>\n<p>That would not be a difficult achievement, Lan Wangji wants to say, but bites it back, doing his best to ignore Wei Wuxian\u2019s words where they settle in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet yours is another Lan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him. \u201cAll that no-nonsense, no-romance stuff. I\u2019m sure you two will be very happy together.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sarcasm earns Wei Wuxian another heated scowl, but Wei Wuxian just smiles sunnily back at him, clearly pleased to have snagged Lan Wangji\u2019s attention again.</p>\n<p>This conversation is over. For no reason other than petty spite, Lan Wangji silences Wei Wuxian again, ignoring the small tantrum in his periphery as he does his best to unhear everything from this last conversation.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t help but pity the person destined to deal with Wei Wuxian forever, he thinks, watching through his eyelashes as Wei Wuxian finally returns to copying rules, his face blotched a deep red from resisting the silencing spell. It\u2019s enough of a trying task just to try to modify his uncouth behavior. Whoever Wei Wuxian\u2019s soulmate is will have to constantly keep him in check. To wake up every day to overbright laughter and teasing jibes and swooning, ridiculous notions about love.</p>\n<p>It would be awful, Lan Wangji thinks, ignoring the unsteady rocking of his chest, like a boat on storm-tossed waters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A routine develops. Every day, Wei Wuxian \u2014 Wei Ying \u2014 causes a ruckus in class, enabled by the quietly cackling Nie Huaisang and some of the other Jiang disciples. Every day, he makes his library punishment as difficult as possible, for both himself and Lan Wangji. Every day, Lan Wangji silences him at least once.</p>\n<p>Every day, Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze snags on the red thread looped around Wei Ying\u2019s wrist, and he wonders.</p>\n<p>The routine is broken about a week and a half later when Wei Ying doesn\u2019t show up to the library. This negligence is to be completely expected. Lan Wangji is going to give him a quarter shichen to show up before he goes out to hunt him down with his not-inconsiderable tracking skills.</p>\n<p>Then, surprisingly, Wei Ying does appear, flushed and sweaty and panting for breath and his arms wound tight behind his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are late,\u201d Lan Wangji says sternly at his arrival.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying beams at him with all of his teeth, and Lan Wangji\u2019s heart constricts. An odd reaction. Discomfort or anxiety, perhaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how hard Lan er-gongzi has been working to oversee this humble student,\u201d Wei Ying begins in ingratiating tones, crossing the library floor with his arms still behind his back. It cannot mean anything good. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d bring a small gift in thanks. Not Emperor\u2019s Smile this time, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji warns, disliking the general direction of this.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s arms snap out in front of him in a white blur, and suddenly, Lan Wangji\u2019s lap is full of \u2014 soft, wriggling warmth. Warmth that is very much alive.</p>\n<p>It renders Lan Wangji mute with shock. He can only stare downward, frozen to his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cBunnies!\u201d Wei Ying says happily. \u201cLook at how cute they are, Lan Zhan! I saw the two of them on the back mountain and knew I had to catch them for you, if only to see your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Lan Wangji says, strangely flustered as the rabbits poke and sniff their way across his lap; cloud-like balls of fur and wiggling, pink noses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji adores them, helplessly and immediately. He hates the fact that he does. But he does. One of his hands comes up to cup the downy fur of the white one, his heart twisting strangely in his chest. He\u2019s not sure what his face is doing, but it is likely damning.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is watching his expression closely when Lan Wangji looks up, just in time to see delighted awe break over his features, a soft light.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Lan Zhan, you\u2026\u201d Wei Ying says, his eyes so warm. Almost tender. \u201cYou really like them, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet <em> out, </em>\u201d Lan Wangji yells at him, and Wei Ying scampers away cackling while Lan Wangji buries his face in his hands, miserably, as the bunnies scuffle on his desk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s during the third week of Wei Ying\u2019s library punishment when it happens.</p>\n<p>The afternoon starts out as any other has, with Wei Ying deliberately trying to annoy Lan Wangji and Lan Wangji stonily ignoring him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is, unfortunately for Lan Wangji, keenly perceptive, and he had picked up from their first days in the library that the most likely way to engage Lan Wangji was the soulmate conversation.</p>\n<p>So today, Wei Ying asks, with no subtlety, \u201cHey, Lan Zhan, have you ever tried to talk to your soulmate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a breath, aware he\u2019s being baited. He replies anyway. \u201cHow would I do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019re a <em> really </em> strong cultivator,\u201d Wei Ying says, propping his chin on one hand and swaying forward on his desk. He uses the other to twirl a dark strand of his hair around his finger, around and around. \u201cSurely you could come up with some creative way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d is all Lan Wangji says, and he continues copying lines before he comes to the humiliating realization that he\u2019s been mindlessly sketching the characters of Wei Ying\u2019s name instead of Lan An\u2019s poetry. Carefully, so as not to draw Wei Ying\u2019s attention to it, he rips out the leaf of paper and crumples it in his fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, for example,\u201d Wei Ying is saying, chipper and blessedly oblivious, \u201cI found out when I was young that if I use spiritual energy a certain way, I can do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying closes his eyes in concentration, and from across the room, Lan Wangji sees the red thread around his wrist jerk, as though it\u2019s been yanked.</p>\n<p>At the same moment, Lan Wangji feels the familiar, unmistakable tug at his own wrist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His breathing stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it a lot,\u201d Wei Ying continues over the sudden oceanic roar in Lan Wangji\u2019s ears, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get much of a response, which makes me think my soulmate isn\u2019t a very strong cultivator. That\u2019s fine, though. Cultivation isn\u2019t everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>A coincidence. That\u2019s all it had been, Lan Wangji reasons, still feeling dizzy. A very odd coincidence, but there\u2019s absolutely no possibility that \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou try it,\u201d Wei Ying says, guilelessly eager as he stares at Lan Wangji from across the room.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s heart thunders in his chest, a rapidfire knock against his ribs. With practiced ease, he reaches out with his qi to pluck the string, and watches with mounting horror as Wei Ying startles the moment he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that was strange,\u201d Wei Ying says with a small laugh, a smaller frown. \u201cIt felt like\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>All at once, aglow in a slant of sunlight through the library windows, the red thread is visible, a long scarlet string that spans the space between them. Less translucent, more solid than Lan Wangji has ever seen it. On one end is Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist; on the other is Wei Wuxian\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Lan Wangji chokes out, just as Wei Ying blurts, in disbelief, \u201cYou?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Much like when he was young, Lan Wangji follows the rules. He does not sprint to the hanshi and throw himself at his xiongzhang\u2019s feet in despair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He walks. Very, very quickly and with purpose, with a pace as if ants are crawling in his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen greets him with a smile when he enters, though he seems puzzled by the unexpected entrance. \u201cI did not \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive my intrusion, xiongzhang,\u201d Lan Wangji says, out of breath, then salutes. He\u2019s still shaking. Lan Xichen observes his discomposure with visibly growing concern and confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji, what\u2019s happened?\u201d he says in a low voice, standing up from his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d Lan Wangji says miserably, his throat tight. An impending migraine throbs at his temples. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Lan Xichen asks.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t say it in words, not yet. He holds up his wrist, hoping his brother will understand.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen does. His eyes widen, an audible breath pressing out of him. \u201c...I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that there are...there are means to remove it,\u201d Lan Wangji says, in what he thinks is an admirably steady tone of voice, for the havoc thrashing around inside him. \u201cDoctors who specialize in surgery of spirit, not flesh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji, slow down,\u201d Lan Xichen says, his brow furrowing. It is perhaps the first time in his life Lan Wangji has received this instruction. \u201cRemoval is an incredibly drastic measure. I don\u2019t think it will be necessary, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has only heard rumors of soulmate thread removal, but has never actually encountered information on it. It\u2019s true that the circumstances he\u2019s heard are more dramatic, usually the bereaved begging for their black threads to be removed. But he thinks being bound as Wei Ying\u2019s soulmate may suffice as a necessary grounds for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers. The words sound so small, incredibly childish even to his own ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave patience, Wangji,\u201d his xiongzhang says gently. \u201cYou hardly even know Wei-gongzi yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know enough,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen smiles at him, warm and maybe a little pained. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time with him, have you not? Have you not seen any redeeming qualities?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, neither an affirmative or dissent.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows there are no set rules for how to act on soulmate threads. Someone with a silver thread could fall for and marry their intended platonic soulmate; someone could have a silver or blue thread and still happily love and marry another person. (His brother\u2019s silver thread showed up when he was thirteen, its other half still unknown.) Someone could have the red thread and still not love or want to be with their intended. (Lan Wangji thinks of his parents.)</p>\n<p>The thread is not binding; he is not promised to Wei Ying. And yet, in a way, he is: Since they were young, their paths have been intertwined. For better or worse, their hearts are cut from the same cloth, as little as Lan Wangji can understand it. The soulmate threads do not lie, and they do not make mistakes.</p>\n<p>Which means the color of the thread is also no mistake. With sweating palms, Lan Wangji thinks about the hours he\u2019s wasted trying to catch glimpses of Wei Ying as covertly as he can, his slim wrists and firm waist and the beautiful arch of his neck, the fullness of his lips and the glow of his smile. Lan Wangji is already in danger; he just hadn\u2019t realized quite how much.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen watches the array of emotions spelled out on his face; indetectable to any other, but a glaring beacon to his brother who knows him best.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have...already fallen?\u201d he guesses, not unkindly. Almost sympathetic.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head, reeling. \u201cNo. <em> No. </em> He is not \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji ah,\u201d Lan Xichen says, gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Fate cannot be helped, after all. Although his behavior may...challenge our principles, Wei-gongzi has a good spirit. He\u2019s intelligent and lively and your equal in a fight, as well as in cultivation. You could have a much worse partner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not \u2014 \u201d Lan Wangji says, squeezing his eyes shut. He trails off, says nothing for several moments.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen waits patiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat will shufu say,\u201d Lan Wangji eventually mutters, staring down at his wrist.</p>\n<p>At this, Lan Xichen quirks a smile, genuinely amused. \u201cShufu will be...displeased at first, I am sure, but he too cannot contest the mysterious workings of fate. If Wei-gongzi is truly your intended as you say, he will accept it in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even get a <em> choice,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji says, a little despairingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was he doomed to fall for Wei Wuxian from their first day? From before? Has the universe been mocking him all this time, offering him someone so completely his opposite, so utterly <em> infuriating</em>? He suddenly pictures Yue Lao gleefully laughing at him, and his fists knot even tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove is always a choice, Wangji,\u201d his xiongzhang says, at once very serious. \u201cThe threads guide but do not define.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to mention their parents for Lan Wangji to know what he means, what they are both thinking of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you choose Wei-gongzi, and he chooses you,\u201d Lan Xichen continues, \u201cthen the thread is of no consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t know what he expects of Wei Ying regarding this development, but their first conversation about it is about as disastrous as he could imagine.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Wei Ying says in the library two days later, and promptly slaps a stack of scrolls down in front of him. \u201cAt first, I will be completely honest, the idea of being your soulmate didn\u2019t thrill me. But then I thought, well, we\u2019re bound together for a reason, right? The threads are never wrong. And if we\u2019re going to be lovers, I thought we should probably educate ourselves a little, just for mutual benefit and satisfaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Lan Wangji chokes out. \u201c<em>You </em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe red thread,\u201d Wei Ying says, with barely suppressed impatience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has clearly done the same mental calculations about their predicament as he has. Lan Wangji is already blushing to the roots of his hair even without knowing the books\u2019 contents. He wants to melt into the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I gathered these texts with some help from my good friend Nie Huaisang,\u201d Wei Ying continues, blithely unaware of Lan Wangji\u2019s inner turmoil. \u201cI think they could be educational if we\u2019re going to be married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no rule we have to marry just because we are bound,\u201d Lan Wangji points out through gritted teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sulks at him. \u201cAiii, Lan Zhan, you\u2019re no fun. What\u2019s all the resistance for? Can\u2019t you just fall for my boyish charm like everyone else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji absolutely <em> will not. </em> He hasn\u2019t \u2014 he has not. He won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens one of the books just for something to do with his hands, to distract himself from Wei Ying saying absurd things about falling in love, and it takes him a blank moment before he understands what he\u2019s looking at. When he does, blood rushes to his head with shocking speed, drowning out the sound of Wei Ying\u2019s chatter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s...cut-sleeve erotica. The opened page depicts one half-dressed man with his head thrown back, clearly in the throes of ecstasy, and another man between his legs, using his mouth to \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji jolts up from the table, painfully slamming his knee as he stumbles back into the nearest shelf. The fire in his blood makes his eyes smart.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stops talking to frown at him. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow \u2014 <em>dare you,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji manages, and wonders if it\u2019s possible to die from rage. Cultivators have qi-deviated from less. The lewd picture is still seared to the backs of his eyelids. The fact that Wei Wuxian had showed up just expecting to, to \u2014 to <em>go through </em>texts like this with him \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives him a puzzled look, cataloging the violence of his reaction. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about this? It\u2019s just art. Surely you\u2019ve seen artwork like this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is trembling as he stares at Wei Ying, speechless with fury.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Realization dawns over Wei Ying\u2019s features, and he looks back at Lan Wangji with his mouth popped ajar. \u201cWait, have you really not\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Lan Wangji fumes. \u201cOf course I \u2014 you \u2014 <em> shameless </em> \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be ashamed of about this?\u201d Wei Ying asks as though he\u2019s genuinely surprised, cocking his head. \u201cOkay, at first, to be totally honest, I also was kind of surprised at the idea of my soulmate being a man, given it\u2019s the <em> red </em> thread and all. I was uncomfortable with it for, mmm, about a day. I\u2019ve always really liked pretty girls, so I always thought it would be a woman on the other end of the thread. But then I got over it when I realized it doesn\u2019t really matter. You\u2019re as pretty as any girl \u2014 prettier, really \u2014 and the mechanics of this part are pretty much the same. Lan Zhan ah, you shouldn\u2019t care so much about things like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Lan Wangji lashes out again, for lack of something better to say. His mind is rabbiting in several different directions. Wei Ying finds him pretty? This conversation cannot be happening \u2014 Wei Ying can\u2019t possibly be talking about...doing <em> that </em> with Lan Wangji, with utter and academic seriousness, as if it\u2019s an inevitability.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo unreasonable,\u201d Wei Ying mutters, rubbing at his nose the way he does when he\u2019s put out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he glances up at Lan Wangji slyly, an expression Lan Wangji has come to associate with imminent peril.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Wei Ying says at a dismal note, belied by the coy flick of his lashes. \u201cI take it this means you <em> don\u2019t </em> want to practice kissing, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s vision briefly goes white, and in that short span, he realizes he\u2019s unsheathed Bichen. Wei Ying scrambles back, looking faintly alarmed for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, okay, wow! So scary! Lan Zhan, I really think you\u2019re overreacting. Kissing me wouldn\u2019t be so bad, don\u2019t you think?\u201d There\u2019s a trill of laughter in his voice now as he dances away from Bichen\u2019s attempted strike. It makes Lan Wangji\u2019s temper flare even redder. He lashes out again; again, Wei Ying nimbly dodges. \u201cI\u2019ll leave these valuable materials with you that way you can closely study them, and when you\u2019re ready, we can talk about \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Get out,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji shouts, his voice booming so loud in the quiet of the library that it nearly cracks, and Wei Ying fixes him with an unimpressed look before he turns and runs off.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sheathes Bichen, blindly sweeps up the books in one of his sleeves \u2014 he can\u2019t just <em> leave them </em>here where any innocent bystander could find them \u2014 and flees to the jingshi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second he\u2019s through the door, he throws the texts on the bed and presses the heel of his hand to the throb in his groin.</p>\n<p>He leans back against the sliding door with a soft moan, overwhelmed by the relief of just this simple touch. Lan Wangji has never had issues with this element of his control before, but heat has been steadily building under his navel since he opened the book, since Wei Ying had said this and that about kissing with his pink, pink lips and curious mischief in his eyes and the slim curve of his waist \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hitches up the four layers of his robes and reaches into his trousers, his head slamming back against the door when he takes himself in hand. His head is spinning, his mouth dried out with lust. His tongue is a block of wood in his mouth. He\u2019s careening wildly out of control \u2014 he\u2019s never lost his composure quite this badly before, but the need of it burns through him, insuppressible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The books, scattered haphazardly across his bed, seem to stare back at him in judgment.</p>\n<p>Any time a problem like this has arisen \u2014 when he\u2019s woken up hard or with his sheets already soiled \u2014 it has been manageable. Lan Wangji has meditated it away. Sometimes taken a cold bath or a trip to the cold spring, if the issue was more stubborn. There is no stopping this, the sweet friction of his own grip moving against his stiffened cock, already leaking at the tip. It\u2019s dizzying, blinding, a tangible electricity behind his teeth.</p>\n<p>It takes only a moment to finish. Entirely unpermitted, his mind supplies the imagery from the book, only it\u2019s Wei Ying with his head thrown back like that, his expression lost to pleasure, Lan Wangji between his legs with Wei Ying\u2019s cock, hard just like this, in his mouth \u2014 and Lan Wangji bites into his own arm hard enough to sting as he comes with a muffled, miserable sound, his vision starry and his hand and robes suddenly wet.</p>\n<p>His spine slides down along the door so that he\u2019s sitting with his knees curled up to his chest. Panting, disbelieving as he stares down at his spent cock, softening and bare to the air of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s mind has gone pleasantly blank, an unbroken snowdrift. He floats in this state for a moment, observing the odd lack of tension in his body before he returns, with a sharp recoil, to his senses.</p>\n<p>He cannot allow this to happen again, Lan Wangji thinks as he closes his eyes, tips his head back. <em> Wei Ying </em>had done this, unraveled all of his years of carefully curated control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He will be on his guard. This will not happen again. It will not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every night, Wei Ying pulls at the thread, and every night, Lan Wangji jerks off to the thought of him with a shame that burns low and sour in his belly. He never returns the erotic texts, but instead keeps them stored under a loose floorboard in the jingshi, and Wei Ying never asks for them back, perhaps assuming they\u2019d been destroyed.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji studies the images until the yellow pages are thin and worn. He firmly tells himself his fascination with the texts is for educational purposes, as Wei Ying had said. He recites sect rules all the while, meditates and practices handstands until the joints of his shoulders are sore, but it does nothing to abate the bizarre fever that has recently taken hold of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It must be the red thread, he reasons after a week of this. It would make sense that this would be a side-effect that his sect elders never discussed with him. It\u2019s too unspeakable, too appalling. He now, at last, understands their warnings to him about untoward desires, about temptations and the necessity of restraint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, Lan Wangji wonders if Wei Ying is experiencing the same issue, and the mere thought of it makes him hard all over again, groaning into his fist.</p>\n<p>Has Wei Ying done this before? Surely he has, if he has such a demonstrated curiosity in...matters such as this. He is probably an expert in it. What does he think about, what does he imagine when he does it?</p>\n<p>Thinking about him in such a state is enough to push Lan Wangji to finish, a little miserably, and he simmers with shame as he cleans himself up.</p>\n<p>What would his family say, if they knew his lack of restraint? What would the elders say?</p>\n<p>As he tries to sleep, Lan Wangji stares up at the ceiling and forces thoughts of Wei Ying out of his mind. He meditates instead, submerging himself in a cool darkness. Despite this, Wei Ying\u2019s face is the last thing he thinks of before he drifts off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two weeks after the soulmate discovery, they set off lanterns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the other sects and its young disciples are also in attendance \u2014 Jiang Cheng, Jin Zixuan, Nie Huaisang. Lan Wangji has never spoken to any of them, despite his initial promise to his brother. His waking thoughts (and most of his non-waking ones) are consumed by Wei Ying, by this dislike that\u2019s starting to feel less and less like dislike and more like a helpless infatuation, and then he has to take several despairing moments to wonder if it has ever, truly, been dislike, and if he knows himself at all.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes him a lantern, painted with a stunning likeness of one of the rabbits he\u2019d captured from the back mountain. His smile is far brighter, a sunbeam compared to a lantern\u2019s glow, not a hint of teasing or mockery to be detected as he shows Lan Wangji his handiwork.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can feel himself weakening, the stone cliff of his resolve eroding by increments. This boy had kept him company on too many nights to count, had laid in bed li away in Lotus Pier and also thought of him, spoke to him without words. His only consistent companionship in a lonely and friendless childhood.</p>\n<p>His feelings are as confusing as they are terrifying. Lan Wangji had thought his hatred of Wei Ying would be easily tended, a natural dislike due to their diametric opposition. He had been raised to distrust that which opposes, that which challenges, to hold it in contempt. Wei Ying is the first anomaly \u2014\u00a0the only anomaly that has mattered, thus far.</p>\n<p>They release their lanterns. Wei Ying clasps his hands together, the red thread he shares with Lan Wangji burning like an ember against his skin. He says earnestly, \u201cI wish to always pursue justice and to live with no regrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji breathes in, and the stone cliff crumbles completely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, Wei Ying punches Jin Zixuan, and by the next day, he has been formally asked to return home to Lotus Pier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After he prepares his things for his departure to Yunmeng, Wei Ying seeks Lan Wangji out to say goodbye in front of the hanshi. Lan Wangji ignores the aching beat of his heart, the stir of heat in his belly that flares up whenever he sees Wei Ying now.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Wei Ying teases, and tugs at the red thread so it\u2019s a visible line across the distance between them. He reaches out, playfully, to stroke a thumb along Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek, and Lan Wangji\u2019s knees threaten to cave. \u201cMy sweet Lan Zhan, will you miss me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s face burns. Lying is forbidden.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says through his teeth, then turns on his heel and leaves him, the final image of Wei Ying\u2019s startled expression branded in his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of summer passes in a slow, lazy crawl of heat, the heaviness of it unusual for the mountains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cares little about lecture \u2014 and even less so about other sects\u2019 disciples \u2014 now that Wei Ying is not here. Jiang Cheng is gruffly polite to him when they cross paths, but Lan Wangji ignores him, uninterested in making small talk. He goes about his duties, every day the same without the tornado of Wei Ying wreaking havoc on his life. He trains and cultivates and reads and practices guqin, he attends lecture and dutifully answers shufu\u2019s questions to provide other students an upstanding example, he privately tends to the rabbits on the back mountain, he jerks himself off to the thought of Wei Ying writhing and begging underneath him, he goes to sleep, he wakes up at mao shi. He thinks about Wei Ying in Lotus Pier, at home among the lotus pads and the pretty young women and cool green waters and spiced-red dishes and bustling marketplaces that Wei Ying had described to him in such lurid detail.</p>\n<p>He practices guqin every day, and he finds his focus inexcusably wandering as he does. His fingers, almost unconsciously, start to pluck the notes of a different song \u2014 one he has not heard before, and one he has certainly never been taught by his instructors. By the end of the first month, the new piece has taken a loose and undefined shape; not fully finished in execution, but Lan Wangji holds it so clearly in his mind that translating the notes to guqin is almost secondary. He finds it in the backdrop of his dreams, a persistent and distant hum throughout his daily tasks.</p>\n<p>Every night, Wei Ying pulls the thread.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first week, Lan Wangji ignores him. And then he starts to pull back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not long after that idyllic summer, things go to hell.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s home burning to the ground, a broken leg, and being stranded in a monster-infested cave with Wei Ying should not be correlated events, but, oddly enough, they are.</p>\n<p>After Lan Wangji watches the Cloud Recesses burn and feels a piece of his heart go with it \u2014 after his brother disappears, after everyone he knows is either dead, injured, or gone missing \u2014 he is dragged on a shattered leg to Qishan. It is quite possibly the last place on earth he wants to be.</p>\n<p>But as he limps into Nightless City, he catches a glimpse of Wei Ying, watches his eyes widen as their gazes meet across the distance after nearly a year apart, and there\u2019s a lightness in him for the first time in months. A weakness. A relief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8<br><br></p>\n<p>The Wens drag them through the forests outside Nightless City like cattle, herding them toward Dusk Creek Mountain. It is a grueling journey, given Lan Wangji\u2019s injured leg, and he lags far behind the rest of the cultivators even as he tries his hardest to keep up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they finally do stop for rest, Lan Wangji watches as Wei Ying flirts with a Jin girl named Mianmian, as he whips out his usual arsenal of quick wit and sunny smiles for someone else. Lan Wangji seethes. His sect rules outline precautionary measures about jealousy, the inherent dangers of its toxicity being housed within, but Lan Wangji cannot help it for the life of him. It eats away at his insides like an acid.</p>\n<p>The pain of his leg, barely healed from being broken, does little to add to his mood. In a fume of despair, he hobbles away from Wei Ying to rest on a nearby tree stump. It\u2019s humiliating that <em> this, </em>of all things, is what\u2019s pushing him to the verge of angry tears, even though he knows rationally that his destroyed home, his missing brother, his injured uncle, his confiscated sword, the heat, his thirst, and the unrelenting pain of his crippled leg all have probably contributed to his general misery.</p>\n<p>Mianmian angrily berates Wei Ying as he dances around her with some sachet that he\u2019s managed to tease away from her, as shameless and frivolous as he always is. Lan Wangji\u2019s alleged soulmate, flirting with somebody else, as if Lan Wangji has any face left to lose now. He has not seen Wei Ying in almost a year, and had missed him every day of it. It is awful to feel like this. He stews in the swamp of his envy, trying to swallow down the thick feeling of it in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, and Lan Zhan startles and looks up at him; when had he gotten over here?</p>\n<p>Wei Ying crouches down next to him, and suddenly Lan Wangji\u2019s embarrassment has an audience. He tilts his chin away, unable to look Wei Ying in the eye, his stomach fluttering with nerves. He hopes the move will pass for the apathy he is desperately trying to project over the unfortunate noise of his inner turmoil.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, let me carry you,\u201d Wei Ying says, and Lan Wangji turns his head back to blink at him, sure he\u2019s somehow misheard.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still kneeling down next to him, a hand cupped on Lan Wangji\u2019s uninjured knee. His gaze is frank and concerned, absent of any trace of his usual teasing. Lan Wangji has rarely seen him so serious, and it has an odd effect on him: His pulse picks up, beating against the roof of his mouth.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time he has spoken to Wei Ying since they parted at the Cloud Recesses, all those months ago. He looks older, his familiar features having slightly sharpened without Lan Wangji around to watch it happen. More handsome now than boyishly pretty. But still a good degree of boyishly pretty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, again, more insistently. \u201cI heard them say your leg is broken. Let me carry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lan Wangji answers. The mental image of such an act is preposterous; he would lose what little face he has left. He would appear even more conspicuously weak than he already does, when Wen Chao already has a target fixed to his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>,\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cDon\u2019t always say you\u2019re fine when you\u2019re not. What\u2019s a little carrying between soulmates, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes snap to his, assessing for mockery, but there\u2019s none he can detect. Just Wei Ying\u2019s face too close to his \u2014 a river-gray gaze, sun-warm and earnest and beautiful, the comfort of its familiarity its own homecoming, and <em> ah, </em>Lan Wangji feels a pang sound out in his chest, ringing inside him like a strike to a singing bowl.</p>\n<p>He shoves past Wei Ying and limps as quickly as he can to catch up with the rest of the group, ignoring the weight of Wei Ying\u2019s concerned eyes on his retreating back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo stubborn,\u201d he hears Wei Ying mutter behind him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cannot afford to be distracted by Wei Ying, not here, or to let his feelings be noticed, used as a liability against them both. If Wen Chao finds out about their soulmate thread, he will show no mercy to either of them. As if destroying the Cloud Recesses and its most precious items was not enough, Lan Wangji thinks bitterly, and experiences a rare flash of hatred.</p>\n<p>The hatred crystallizes into killing intent when Wen Chao shoves Wei Ying off a small cliff inside Dusk Creek Mountain. He is certain it can be felt, but Wen Chao is either too stupid or too distracted to pick up on it, consumed with greed as he is.</p>\n<p>However, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t get to enact any of his increasingly violent fantasies against Wen Chao because from there, things progress very quickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, they find the monster \u2014 the Tusha Xuanwu, if Lan Wangji\u2019s assumption is not mistaken \u2014 and chaos ensues. Second, Wei Ying, who is apparently infuriatingly noble under all of that chattering bravado, attempts to sacrifice himself; first by protecting Mianmian from a flaming brand, and then by staying behind as the others swim to safety. Third, Lan Wangji stays to help Wei Ying because the idea of leaving him here to face this creature alone is entirely unthinkable, which results in almost losing his leg entirely.</p>\n<p>This is how he and Wei Ying end up trapped, alone together in a cave underneath the earth \u2014 chilled to the bone, sopping wet in dirty, bloodied pond water, both severely injured, and probably about to starve to death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It all seems oddly fitting somehow, Lan Wangji reflects bleakly as they both settle against the slick cave wall and try to catch their breaths. His and Wei Ying\u2019s fates are tied together, after all.</p>\n<p>The sensation of Wei Ying shucking up his wet robes pulls Lan Wangji back to his senses; the motion bares his new wound to the cold air. Lan Wangji hisses at the pain and unexpectedness of it, and Wei Ying flits a sympathetic glance to him before he looks around for something to brace his leg.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is bleeding steadily from the arm where an arrow had pierced him \u2014 from one of Lan Wangji\u2019s own cowardly disciples, no less. There\u2019s also a new brand mark burned into his chest, the destroyed skin peeking out through the charred layers of his clothes. Looking at his injuries while Wei Ying tries to treat him, Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach twists. Both could have been prevented, he thinks. Wei Ying will carry these scars with him for the rest of his life, a permanent marring that cannot be undone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho would have thought Mianmian\u2019s silly little perfume pouch actually would come in handy?\u201d Wei Ying muses to himself as he taps some of the herbs into his open palm. \u201cI was really just messing with her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you flirt when you don\u2019t mean it,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps before he can stop himself, then feels himself flush as Wei Ying blinks up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about flirting?\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything, it\u2019s just for fun. Surely you\u2019re not actually drinking vinegar over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should give Luo-guniang your red thread then,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, so sullen even to his own ears, and Wei Ying blinks again in surprise before he flashes a wide, delighted grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs <em> that </em> what this is about?\u201d Wei Ying teases while Lan Wangji scowls at him. \u201cLan Zhan ah, Lan Zhan. I had no idea you cared about such things<em>. </em>So sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lan Wangji retorts, just shy of burying his face into his lap and staying there for the rest of his immortality.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Wei Ying laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll tease you after you\u2019re not hurting. Do you have anything to tie this brace, by the way?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at him warily, and in the next moment, Wei Ying reaches for his headband.</p>\n<p>He manages to loosen it before Lan Wangji slaps his hand away. \u201cDo <em> not.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just said I\u2019m your soulmate!\u201d Wei Ying whines, rubbing at his afflicted hand with the other. \u201cIsn\u2019t the rule that soulmates get to touch it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, which gives Wei Ying enough leeway to snatch it from his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei <em> Ying,</em>\u201d he grits out.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan</em>,\u201d Wei Ying echoes Lan Wangji in the same tone, far more smugly, then ties the ribbon around his wounded leg.</p>\n<p>This is the worst day of Lan Wangji\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>The moment the thought crosses his mind, the universe sets out to prove his point: Wei Ying stands up and starts to disrobe, perfunctorily peeling off each soaked layer and letting them pool on the ground with wet slaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d Lan Wangji manages, as if the answer isn\u2019t dreadfully apparent.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking my clothes off,\u201d Wei Ying replies, without a single care. \u201cThey\u2019re stinking and soaking wet, plus I need the cloth for bandages.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns his head away, working his jaw against the heat crawling up his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you would rather drown in Xuanwu blood, Lan Zhan, but you really should consider doing the same,\u201d Wei Ying tells him, settling cross-legged onto the hard cave floor. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get colder down here, and you\u2019ll get sick if you wear wet robes for too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t answer, sneaking a look at Wei Ying through lowered lids. His top is bare, the hollows of his collarbones thrown into stark relief from the firelight; the cords of his biceps firm, his torso slender but lean with muscle. His nipples have hardened completely from the cold. Lan Wangji clenches his fist where it\u2019s tucked away in his sleeve, his mouth drying out.</p>\n<p>Yes, this is definitely the worst day of his life.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is distracted, ripping up one of his robes for strips of cloth, but it just makes the firelight glide more appealingly along his skin as his muscles work, touching his body to a palette of oranges and golds. He seems entirely oblivious to Lan Wangji\u2019s scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is so distracted that he full-body flinches when Wei Ying takes one of the bandages and wraps it around his leg, then ties it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gags; the pain of the jostling movement congeals the thick feeling in his chest. It feels like something sour has settled in his lungs, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hesitates, appraising him thoughtfully, before he says, \u201cHey, Lan Zhan, remember what I said about practicing kissing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lan Wangji chokes, immediately panicked. He cannot seriously \u2014 Wei Ying doesn\u2019t really mean to \u2014 here, of all places \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Ying says brightly, his eyes gleaming like polished coins. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re alone now, so we might as well, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying leans toward him, and Lan Wangji\u2019s mind blanks, the shock of it a hard grip in his chest, and he \u2014 immediately turns to the side and throws up.</p>\n<p>Humiliating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he recovers himself, Wei Ying is pressing, gentle but pointed, along his meridians, soothing small pinches of spiritual energy here and there.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Wei Ying says, with clear satisfaction. \u201cFeels better with the old blood gone, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji begins, annoyed and wildly, bizarrely disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about the kissing thing,\u201d Wei Ying says breezily, pulling back from him. \u201cBut hey, it worked, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stays silent, unsure what to say to this. His heart is still knocking way too hard against his ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, for lack of something better, and because he does owe Wei Ying a thanks, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, none of that,\u201d Wei Ying says with a grimace. \u201cDon\u2019t make it weird.\u201d Then he twists to reach for the arrow wound on the back of his arm.</p>\n<p>Clearly there\u2019s a demon possessing Lan Wangji, because there\u2019s no other explanation for why, in the wake of everything that\u2019s just happened, he hears his own voice tell Wei Ying, \u201cLet me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swivels back to look at him in surprise, before he says, more eagerly, \u201cOkay,\u201d and scrambles over to sit next to Lan Wangji. Lan Wangji has noticed that Wei Ying likes being close to people, likes to lay touches on his loved ones and to soak up the nearness of those around him. So he tries his hardest not to flinch away when Wei Ying turns his back to him and offers the herbal pouch over his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes it, silently breathes in through his mouth. Then he pinches some of the healing herbs and presses it into the arrow wound on the back of Wei Ying\u2019s tricep. Wei Ying hardly flinches, but his shoulder does twitch at the contact.</p>\n<p>Focusing on the bloody mess of the wound proves to be a surprisingly efficient distraction from the expanse of Wei Ying\u2019s warm, bare skin, the knobs of his spine, the curve of his neck. Wei Ying is a good patient, perhaps due to a long history of practice; he\u2019s surprisingly quiet as Lan Wangji works to clean the blood from the wound with a mindless swipe of his own robe. A gush of fresh blood rushes to fill the spot Lan Wangji has cleared.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, then gently presses the remaining herbs into the wound.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sucks his teeth at the discomfort, and then asks, \u201cWhat are you sorry for? It\u2019s not like you shot me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a disciple from GusuLan who did this,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWho hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Wei Ying says easily, and Lan Wangji frowns at the back of his head. It is not okay. \u201cI understand why he did it, you know? It\u2019s practical. More would have been saved with the sacrifice of one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, too harshly, because he\u2019s suddenly sick at the thought of Wei Ying being a sacrifice for anything.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying tilts his head so he\u2019s in profile; he does not quite turn to look at Lan Wangji, but the intention is there. Lan Wangji drops his gaze and focuses on finishing, tying off the wound with one of the strips of cloth Wei Ying had torn off. Soaked with dirty water, their bandages will not be the cleanest, but they are preferable to losing more blood.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shifts around to face Lan Wangji, and oh, now they\u2019re just as close but looking at each other, and Wei Ying is still so. Exposed. Wei Ying blinks at him, also seeming to register their proximity, before his mouth tilts up in a closed half-smile, observing Lan Wangji closely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had Wei Ying\u2019s earlier offer been in earnest? Lan Wangji wonders, trying not to stare at his mouth. This time, and the time before in the library? About...practicing. Practicing kissing. Or has it all been to get a rise out of him? Because it\u2019s...<em> funny, </em> to Wei Ying, to provoke him with this?</p>\n<p>Involuntarily, Lan Wangji\u2019s attention drops further to Wei Ying\u2019s pectoral, where the sun brand has puffed up enough to lose any of its distinct details.</p>\n<p>Thoughtlessly, governed by an urge outside his understanding, Lan Wangji reaches out to touch it, but Wei Ying catches his breath and he remembers himself and stops just short. He yanks his hand back, his scalp tingling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can touch me, you know,\u201d Wei Ying says. Still watching him, intensely, pupils flickering to track Lan Wangji\u2019s expressions. \u201cIf you ever want to, I mean. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s breath hitches before the panic catches up to him, the familiar paralysis of intimacy, and he leans away, out of Wei Ying\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d he mutters, without any heat, and Wei Ying laughs softly, unbothered.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan, I meant it about your robes,\u201d Wei Ying says, and when Lan Wangji levels a weary glare at him, he adds defensively, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to flirt for once! I really mean it, you\u2019re going to get sick, and we\u2019re both men, anyway. It\u2019s not dishonorable, even if someone were to find us like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His ears are already burning.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Wei Ying says, pitched lower \u2014 a hand to Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder now, a tentative test. \u201cI\u2019m your red thread.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes, either too tired or tongue-tied to resist further as Wei Ying pulls at the lacy folds of his outermost robe. He does feel lighter when it\u2019s gone \u2014 the heavy damp of it had started to settle into him with increasing, near-intolerable discomfort. He shivers as Wei Ying works at the next layer, partially from the cold and partially from the cardiovascular antics of Wei Ying undressing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Wei Ying says with a satisfied sound, when all that\u2019s left on Lan Wangji is the inner robe and his trousers. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel much better than before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Considerately, Wei Ying lays the robes out to dry by the fire, his damp-waved hair swinging down along his arms. Lan Wangji watches him hazily. He can feel the thick pull of sleep despite the rock digging uncomfortably into the back of his skull; despite the throb of his leg, the growling hunger pangs in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says quietly, and Wei Ying tosses him a disapproving look.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop thanking me,\u201d Wei Ying protests. \u201cAiyo, it\u2019s just decency. No need to be so serious all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should rest,\u201d Lan Wangji hears himself say, and Wei Ying replies, but the words slip away from his comprehension, muddled, and the next thing he knows, Lan Wangji is blinking awake. Wei Ying\u2019s warmth is pressed into his side, his head lolled onto Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, and Lan Wangji\u2019s pulse skips at the realization of it. It makes practical sense, after all, to share body warmth in a place as wet and freezing as this, and the craggy cave walls do not make for comfortable pillowing. The boldness of it is, furthermore, completely characteristic for Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>No, Lan Wangji finds he cannot mind it at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help does not come. After days, when they\u2019re left no other option, they fight the monster. It takes hours.</p>\n<p>In the end, the dead monster doesn\u2019t matter. The ribbons sliced deep into Lan Wangji\u2019s palms, split open by rope and string, don\u2019t matter. What matters is that Wei Ying slips into a fever after the fight, his brand and his arm wound infected from so much time in filthy pond water.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s head lolls from one side to the other as Lan Wangji rights him against the cave wall and gives him an urgent shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, petulant even now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, stay awake,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His hands are still shaking from adrenaline and the muscular fatigue from the fight, and he places one of them to Wei Ying\u2019s hot, clammy cheek. There\u2019s a reek all around them, monster blood and viscera and the cold cavernous damp.</p>\n<p>He spends the next undefined span of time passing Wei Ying what\u2019s left of his spiritual energy, but there is not much, and it seems to do only a little good. It isn\u2019t long before Wei Ying is dozing off again, muttering this and that about his boredom, and Lan Wangji says again, more wildly than before, \u201cWei Ying, <em> stay awake</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen make me,\u201d Wei Ying mushes out, then smacks his lips as though he\u2019s thirsty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, then says, helplessly, \u201cHow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSing me something,\u201d Wei Ying suggests. His eyes are closed and fluttering, his breathing too shallow and uneven. \u201cSerenade me with your pretty voice, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ridiculous, Lan Wangji thinks, tiredly and without heat. He only has a handful of strings with him, but it\u2019s enough to \u2014 enough to play something, probably, if that\u2019s what Wei Ying wants. In regular circumstances, he could play a Song of Clarity to restore Wei Ying\u2019s strength, but his own energy is entirely depleted.</p>\n<p>So, tentative at first, strangely and viscerally shy about it, he plays through the song he has composed over the last year. It isn\u2019t like Wei Ying will remember it, anyway. He has to modify it slightly as he goes, with his limited instrumentals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the first play-through, Wei Ying is softly humming with him, a small smile pulling at his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Wei Ying rasps, when a ringing silence falls after the second play-through ends. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji, until now, has not given it a name, although one had stubbornly attached itself the moment he had first started to play it. He had immediately pushed it to the back of his thoughts and kept it there, embarrassed with himself for the sheer schmaltz of it. Nonetheless, he had never been able to shake the title, those two characters, whenever he played. As if the song had forcefully named itself.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem so hard to say it now, in the dark and dripping quiet with Wei Ying as they slowly die. It feels like the last chance to tell him something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s certain Wei Ying is fully out, Lan Wangji scoops him up under his shoulders. His skin is still too hot, especially for the temperature here. A little awkwardly, given his bad leg, he maneuvers Wei Ying\u2019s head into his lap, and in his sleep, Wei Ying sighs and the pinch of his brow smoothes out, as if he had been distressed before.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji uncomfortably settles his shoulders against the cold rock, and for a long time stares emptily into the dying flames of their makeshift fire. He will have to rebuild it soon, which may be difficult without Wei Ying\u2019s talismans. He sighs, and drops his gaze to Wei Ying again.</p>\n<p>He must have miscalculated the depth of Wei Ying\u2019s unconsciousness, because he startles to find Wei Ying\u2019s half-lidded eyes fixed on him, dark and bleary.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, and there\u2019s a dry click of his throat, trying to swallow. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, shifting Wei Ying\u2019s head so it\u2019s pillowed more comfortably on his inner thigh. Wei Ying tilts further into it, his nose brushing against Lan Wangji\u2019s dirty robes.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, more insistently. He starts to squirm, his breaths picking up as though he\u2019s anxious. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t get sick again, okay? I promise, I almost never get sick. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks and steadies Wei Ying\u2019s thrashing movements with his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you get sick again,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cIt would be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying whines, as though this is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji replies evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne day when we\u2019re married,\u201d Wei Ying slurs out, his closed eyelids shining. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one taking care of you, okay, er-gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face burns hotter than any fever. Wei Ying is delirious, he reminds himself; he has no idea what he\u2019s saying, nor is he likely to remember it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to let me,\u201d Wei Ying says stubbornly. \u201cOkay? Do you promise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows hard around the strange lump lodged in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, almost inaudibly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it,\u201d Wei Ying insists, \u201cI wanna hear you say it.\u201d</p>\n<p>As strange as the conversation is, Lan Wangji is helpless to do anything but comply. He answers softly, \u201cI promise to let Wei Ying take care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, canting his head to the side again, his cheeks still flushed with fever. \u201cAh, it\u2019s good, right, gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHush,\u201d is all Lan Wangji can think of to say, and he tentatively runs a hand through Wei Ying\u2019s matted hair. He\u2019s never touched anyone like this, ever, and he\u2019s surprised by how natural it is; his hand picks up into a more assured rhythm, soothing strokes along the crown of Wei Ying\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels good, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles. \u201cAh. So nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRest,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, and like a miracle, Wei Ying obeys, the tension in his neck slacking and his mouth falling open.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches him for a long time, trying to ignore the traitorous stuttering of his heart. Wei Ying is so cute, even like this. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to be distracted by, so he tries to redirect his attention by passing what little remains of his spiritual energy to Wei Ying. Wei Ying\u2019s core is strong, probably the strongest he\u2019s encountered, but the toll of the resentment and the fight after days of injury and starvation is severe, and Lan Wangji\u2019s own energy is nearly gone.</p>\n<p>Perhaps belatedly, it occurs to Lan Wangji as a real possibility that they may die here. Lan Wangji tries to summon a sense of alarm over it, but maybe due to his own exhaustion, he finds he cannot. He had watched his home burn down to the ground, taking many of his peers with it. If he\u2019s to die, there are worse ways than doing so with Wei Ying asleep on his lap.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t long before he drifts off into a muddled state of restless, painful half-sleep. Thoughts of dying spin in his head like motes of light, prevent him from fully sinking into a full-bellied darkness, and when he wakes again, voices swim around him, urgent and undefined.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stirs, consciousness trickling back to him. Sensation presses into him in waves, the more he wakes. He\u2019s never been so weak, so tired, so hungry or thirsty.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 er-gongzi,\u201d a harsh voice says, more clearly now, and Lan Wangji rouses further.</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji blinks again, Jiang Cheng\u2019s pinched expression is a blur in front of him. His skin is a bloodless pale, his jaw clenched. The cleanness of him seems odd, for such a setting.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Jiang Cheng says again when their eyes meet, and a strange look flickers across his face, too complicated for Lan Wangji to understand in this reduced state. \u201cI need you to let go of my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Wei Ying. </em>Lan Wangji is far more alert now, alert enough to realize that he and Wei Ying, at some point during their sleep, must have molded around each other, propped up against the cave wall. Wei Ying is curled up in the circle of his arms, too still and too cold, huddled tightly against his chest. There\u2019s an unfamiliar hand on Lan Wangji\u2019s arm. It\u2019s Jiang Cheng\u2019s, trying to peel his grasp away.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shoves Jiang Cheng\u2019s hand away, too disoriented to focus on courtesy. Ignoring Jiang Cheng\u2019s indignant sound of protest, Lan Wangji tilts Wei Ying\u2019s jaw toward him, places a shaking hand to the pulse just beneath. His spiritual energy is faint, but still beats; his heartbeat is sluggish but still pulses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, with this assurance, Lan Wangji loosens his grip, and Jiang Cheng calls for Jin Zixuan\u2019s help over his shoulder. He watches in a daze as Jiang Cheng pulls a slumped Wei Ying out of his arms and to his feet, then as he wraps one of Wei Ying\u2019s limp arms around his shoulders. Jin Zixuan takes up the other side. Wei Ying\u2019s head lolls toward his chest as limp as a child\u2019s doll, his ponytail swinging.</p>\n<p><em> Wei Ying, </em>Lan Wangji tries to say, but cannot.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi, can you walk?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks, fixing him with an unimpressed look, and Lan Wangji tries to move his legs. A stab of pain shimmies up his injured one, but he nods silently to Jiang Cheng\u2019s inquiry. He does not need their help.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill he,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His voice is nearly unrecognizable, a small rasp. \u201cWill he live?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng flexes his jaw, as if in exasperation, then rolls his eyes. \u201cThis dumbass is nearly impossible to kill, believe me. Are you coming or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pulls himself to his feet, leaning shakily on the cave wall to do so. Once he\u2019s upright, Jiang Cheng and Jin Zixuan turn without another word, hauling Wei Ying with them. Lan Wangji limps behind as they make their way in the direction of the entrance. He\u2019s so woozy that his knees are shaking, as limp as noodles. The Wens have Bichen, so he will need to walk home. It will be a long and grueling journey on foot \u2014 he will be defenseless, should he run into any enemies. He is not sure, in his current state, that he will be able to make it.</p>\n<p>Climbing back up the ropes, with his unhealed leg and his fatigue, is a trial for Lan Wangji in and of itself, but it\u2019s even harder for Jiang Cheng and Jin Zixuan, with an unconscious Wei Ying between them. Eventually, Jiang Cheng grunts and wraps one tight arm around Wei Ying\u2019s middle before levering himself up the cliff face with one arm, Jin Zixuan spotting him on the ropes from below. Their alliance is new to Lan Wangji, but he never pays attention to such matters, anyway. So long as Wei Ying is safe.</p>\n<p>The reinforcing Jiang and Jin disciples have unblocked the rock-stuffed entrance, and for the first time in nearly a week, as he hobbles out of the cave, Lan Wangji breathes in fresh air. The assault of sunlight leaves him momentarily blind, and he blinks several times through tears before his sight returns.</p>\n<p>Then Lan Wangji watches, a little helplessly, as Jiang Cheng lays Wei Ying down just outside the cave, as he kneels next to his brother to transfer some of his own spiritual energy. Shockingly enough, Jin Zixuan joins him, and as they continue, some of the color returns to Wei Ying\u2019s cheeks and lips, his breaths coming easier.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Jiang Cheng says over his shoulder. \u201cI received word that Zewu-jun has returned to the Cloud Recesses. It may be in your best interest to return there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s not meant as a dismissal, but it certainly feels like one. And Jiang Cheng isn\u2019t wrong to do so, after all: Wei Ying is not his. Lan Wangji has no claim to him or his well-being, besides the thread.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a last look at Wei Ying then turns, in a daze, to limp toward the nearest road, one that will take him southeast.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Wangji,\u201d Jiang Cheng calls after him, and Lan Wangji stops. He doesn\u2019t turn, but rotates his head, just slightly.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng catches up to him before he stops himself short, as though internally debating something. Then he sighs and grabs Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist. Lan Wangji recoils and tries to yank away, shocked by the unwelcome touch, before he feels a flood of spiritual energy through his meridians, and his core surges with it, soaking it up like a parched plant during a rainfall.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor your journey,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters without looking at him. \u201cHe\u2019d kill me if anything happened to you.\u201d Then he turns and walks back toward Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji returns to the burned ruins of the Cloud Recesses where his brother and uncle await him \u2014 all three of them battered, worse for wear, but alive. They allow a week to mourn the fallen before they begin to focus their efforts on rebuilding what\u2019s been lost.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Wei Ying goes missing.</p>\n<p>Following the Wens\u2019 attack on Lotus Pier, Lan Wangji manages to convince his shufu, after weeks of insistence, to let him search for Wei Wuxian and the missing Jiang siblings. He spins it, in a way he thinks would make Wei Ying proud, as a measure of improving inter-sect alliances against the growing aggression of the QishanWen. And anyway, Lan Wangji is hardly contributive to the physical reconstruction that now takes up most of the daily schedule in the Cloud Recesses. Blessedly, xiongzhang and a couple of the elders support his proposition, so finally, shufu relents, and Lan Wangji sets off from Gusu, his leg mostly healed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes nearly three weeks to find Jiang Cheng in Yiling, also searching for Wei Wuxian. He appears to be mostly recovered from the Wens\u2019 attack, and poorly disguised. There has been no sign of Wei Wuxian, Jiang Cheng tells him \u2014\u00a0not since they\u2019d agreed to meet at the foot of Baoshan Sanren\u2019s mountain, and his brother never showed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all I could find,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, a worried line nocked between his eyebrows, and he holds up a bloodied clarity bell, dented on its left side.</p>\n<p>Without asking, Lan Wangji takes the bell from him. It is, of course, of Jiang make and model, embossed with a lotus pattern and a violet tassel. If it was Wei Ying\u2019s, and Wei Ying is gone, the blood is likely his. Everything inside Lan Wangji shakes.</p>\n<p>He asks to join Jiang Cheng in his search. Jiang Cheng agrees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the first shared night of their search, Jiang Cheng asks Lan Wangji, anxiously, \u201cWhat color is the thread?\u201d</p>\n<p>He asks as though Lan Wangji hasn\u2019t been checking every moment of his waking hours this past month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He answers, \u201cRed.\u201d Then, a moment later: \u201cHe told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng nods, his brow hardening into a glare as he pokes at the dying fire with a stick. \u201cYeah. He wouldn\u2019t shut up about it when he found out. The idiot\u2019s practically obsessed with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng looks a little sheepish when the words leave him, as though he\u2019s revealed too much, but regardless, the information makes Lan Wangji\u2019s heart skip a beat in his chest, to know that there was a chance Wei Ying had thought of him that summer as much as Lan Wangji had.</p>\n<p>He wants to press for more, but of course, he does not.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng seems to sense this, and adds, \u201cHe talked about you all the time, that summer in Lotus Pier. He kept wanting you to come and visit. So ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Lan Wangji\u2019s chest hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have,\u201d he says quietly, and Jiang Cheng snaps his head up to stare at him with an open-mouthed \u201cAh?\u201d, then continues to look at Lan Wangji in amazement.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not say more, or elaborate. He\u2019s already said too much. Jiang Cheng is practically a stranger; it is only circumstance that brings them together now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t stand him,\u201d Jiang Cheng presses, a little doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Lan Wangji says. If it were, would he be here, traveling toward a war-torn Qishan, sharing a campfire with Wei Ying\u2019s adopted brother?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng seems to follow the same line of reasoning, because a moment later, he pokes the fire again and asks, \u201cWhy <em> are </em> you looking for him, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cannot answer that, so he doesn\u2019t. He remains quiet and stares into the low snap of the flames. He can feel that his silence unnerves Jiang Cheng, but he pushes on anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was just because of the soulmate thing,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cLike...obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, Lan Wangji does not answer. He simply removes his bedroll from his qiankun pouch, unspools it, then removes his hairpiece, readying himself for sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much of a talker, are you,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters, a little sour but with no detectable malice, then he stamps out the fire and follows Lan Wangji\u2019s example.</p>\n<p>Even in the dark, under a night sky studded with stars, it takes Lan Wangji a long time to fall asleep. Over and over, he tugs at the thread, but Wei Ying never answers. The other end is unnaturally still, silent.</p>\n<p><em> Wei Ying, </em> Lan Wangji thinks, as consciousness slides away from him into a muddy dark. <em> Where are you? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time they finally find Wei Ying, two months later, an odd partnership has formed between Lan Wangji and Jiang Cheng. It is certainly not intimacy; it is barely even friendship. More an alliance, their relationship defined entirely by a shared and burning drive: Find Wei Ying alive.</p>\n<p>For as little as Lan Wangji cares for Jiang Cheng generally, he is certainly a fair match where ambition is concerned.</p>\n<p>Between them, they are mostly silent, in those nine weeks. They speak to each other only when necessary. They spend days in and out of towns in Qishan; Jiang Cheng, as aggressive and threatening as he can make himself to be, takes the helm on interrogating Wen soldiers and locals for answers, but Lan Wangji\u2019s silent intimidation certainly does not hurt their cause. They spend long, dusty, hot days traveling, and at night as the earth cools, they eat wordlessly by a fire and go to sleep. They wake up the next morning at mao shi, on Lan Wangji\u2019s schedule, and they set out again.</p>\n<p>Word of Wei Ying is rare. It is a thankless quest. When the whispers do come, Lan Wangji and Jiang Cheng reject them as though they were never spoken. They all say the same: that Wei Ying had been thrown to the Burial Mounds and had been consumed, body and soul.</p>\n<p>The red thread says otherwise. Jiang Cheng checks it with the same manic frequency that Lan Wangji does. Sometimes, when they catch wind of rumors like this, in teahouses or marketplaces, Jiang Cheng grabs Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist, just to make sure. It is the only physical touch from him that Lan Wangji will allow.</p>\n<p>Then, at long last, the murmurs grow louder. Mass murders in the Wens\u2019 supervisory offices, unusual cultivation behind it.</p>\n<p>At this, Lan Wangji and Jiang Cheng share a silent, understanding glance, and follow the sound to Jiangling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they do find Wei Ying, he and Lan Wangji fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the last way that Lan Wangji saw their reunion going, after all these months apart, but the cold emptiness in Wei Ying\u2019s eyes terrifies Lan Wangji into a helpless fury. Harsh tones are the only way he\u2019s learned to express the complicated tangle of his feelings around Wei Ying. Including the slither of wrongness that now creeps through him, looking at Wei Ying across from him. He can\u2019t shake the dreadful sense that something irreparable has been permanently lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s features are the same, but the once-full, boyish lines of his face are hollowed out with hunger and something else nameless, something wolfish. His cheeks and jaw are gaunt. His pupils are dark, his lips pale, tinges of red along his lower lids and in the corners of his eyes. He wears all black and carries a black flute, like a figure from a folktale used to scare children into good behavior.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d Wei Ying calls him, devoid of emotion; almost bemused, a little derisive. There is nothing that remains of the laughing boy that had teased and tormented him in the library, that had tugged at the ends of his forehead ribbon and spoken to him gently in a cave as he bandaged a leg injury.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr should I say,\u201d Wei Wuxian amends, and bows his head with a deference that Lan Wangji has never seen from him. \u201cHanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to grab Wei Ying by the shoulders and shake him until his features return to life again, to pelt him with desperate questions. <em> Where have you been? What did this to you? What can I do? Please, is there something I can do?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Instead, Lan Wangji says, helpless and misplaced, \u201cCome back to Gusu with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughs at him, shimmering with scorn and fury.</p>\n<p><em> How can others expect to know my heart? </em>he asks, as though Lan Wangji is a stranger. As though the red thread that still beats between them is of no consequence at all.</p>\n<p>The cold terror ices over further in Lan Wangji, long after he leaves Jiangling. He tugs at the thread on his way back to Gusu, a quiet plea, but just like the months before, there is no reply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does not see Wei Ying again until the end of the Sunshot Campaign. His sect duties keep him busy in the meantime, now that the Cloud Recesses have been almost fully reconstructed, now that his xiongzhang is so involved with Chifeng-zun\u2019s military plans. His thoughts never stray fully from Wei Ying, from the bitter charge of their last encounter.</p>\n<p>In that meantime, he hears many odd and worrisome things about Wei Ying. The dark mutters had started with the murders at the supervisory offices and have only increased in fervor since, and they never stray from Wei Ying as their subject: Wei Wuxian had returned after months away from a dark, wretched place, and it had scraped all goodness from him. Wei Wuxian uses a flute rather than a sword, and he plays it to harness the dead. Wei Wuxian reforged the Stygian Tiger Seal to do his dark bidding, and now seeks to gain power over the sects. Wei Wuxian flaunts a complete lack of respect for any authority figure, including his own sect leader and brother. And through it all, Wei Wuxian still bears the red thread on his wrist, tied to some unknown and piteously unfortunate soul.</p>\n<p>Despite the storm of intrigue around him, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t speak to Wei Ying directly in those months \u2014 only glimpses his figure from afar, like a red-throated raven. Sometimes, he catches Wei Ying looking back, his gaze cool and his pale face impassive.</p>\n<p>All of it slowly drives Lan Wangji into a madness of worry: the distance from him, the unknowns of him \u2014 the insidious rumors that he can do nothing to shield Wei Ying from, because despite the wild misjudgments of Wei Ying\u2019s intentions at a power-grab, they are mostly true.</p>\n<p>So there\u2019s the distance, and more distance \u2014 until Wei Ying is collapsing into his arms at the top of Nightless City, Wen Ruohan\u2019s blood spilling fast across the stone like upturned wine. Meng Yao stands behind him in a daze, his arms shaking and his bloodied saber wobbling.</p>\n<p>Distantly, Lan Wangji registers the moment as significant, the slow-building cheers of celebration from below, disbelieving and then triumphant \u2014 <em> Wen Ruohan is dead \u2014 </em> but Wei Ying is inanimate in his arms, cold even through his layers, his eyelids and lips too pale, and it is all he can think. Resentment curls around Wei Ying, recoiling from Lan Wangji, skittering away from his white sleeves, from his hands that move numbly over Wei Ying. Lan Wangji ignores it, pulls him close.</p>\n<p>Their army cheers for victory in blood-soaked throngs, and apart from them, Lan Wangji carries Wei Ying\u2019s limp body down two hundred steps, into the lower levels of Nightless City.</p>\n<p>For the next three long, unending days, Wei Ying sleeps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s too pale, too cold. His lips are bloodless, his eyelids sunken. His pulse is too sluggish; his spiritual energy, which had still beat even at their lowest in the Xuanwu Cave, is entirely depleted. He lies prone, unmoving, by every visual indication a corpse. The only sign of life is the shallow, wheezy breath that rattles from him, that whistles through his nose and teeth.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji visits Wei Ying night and day, to play Cleansing for him and to monitor his condition. It gives him a fair amount of time with Wei Ying\u2019s siblings, who seem bemused by his constant presence but allow for it without protest. Lan Wangji tries his best not to be underfoot as they provide for Wei Ying with a symbiotic, almost-practiced ease, moving through rituals of care. They are mostly quiet, which suits Lan Wangji just fine; he has not exactly been pining for the sound of Jiang Cheng\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>Over this short span of days, Lan Wangji finds that he likes Jiang Yanli. He would be inclined to like anyone who cares so openly for Wei Ying, but he does genuinely like her, regardless of that fact. No matter the time of day or the circumstance, Jiang Yanli is always vocally grateful to see Lan Wangji; always at the ready with a soothing word, with a cup of tea or soup that he gently declines. There\u2019s a kindness to her with no contrivance, one he later realizes that he recognizes from Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi, A-Xian told me,\u201d Jiang Yanli says to him, on the second day. They both sit at Wei Ying\u2019s bedside, watchful and comfortably quiet, until now. \u201cAbout the red thread you share.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glances at her sideways, feeling oddly embarrassed. When Jiang Cheng had pointed out their thread, that first night in Qishan, it had been matter-of-fact. Clipped, near-brusque, task-related. With Jiang Yanli, he gets the sense that she understands what Lan Wangji attaches to it \u2014 that he has been thoroughly perceived.</p>\n<p>Her dark eyes have fallen on him, and they are kind, almost expectant.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pulls his hand away from where it had crept closer to Wei Ying\u2019s, folded over his chest. This sleeping position is unnatural for him, almost funereal \u2014\u00a0it reminds Lan Wangji, with a sickening lurch of sense-memory, of kneeling vigil by his father\u2019s body. Wei Ying should be sprawled out and unruly across the bed, his limbs starfished wide, taking up too much space. Snuffling into a pillow or mumbling quiet sounds, active even in his sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The red thread glows between them in a cut of sunlight, an obvious flare of color that mirrors the hues of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, a little carefully. \u201cWe are bound.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli smiles wider, a dimple pocking one of her cheeks. \u201cI was glad when A-Xian told me. Lan er-gongzi makes him very happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t help the small noise of disbelief that escapes him at this.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli laughs when she hears it, her eyes warming into crescents. \u201cIt\u2019s true, it really is. He may be a little...ah, roundabout in showing it, but he cares for you.\u201d She lowers her eyelashes and shakes her head as Lan Wangji\u2019s heart pounds in his chest, oddly tight. \u201cAh, I hope he can\u2019t hear us right now. He would be so embarrassed to hear me tell you such things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks back to Wei Ying\u2019s sleeping face and feels his own soften. He itches to touch, but it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to do so in front of Wei Ying\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p>When he looks back, Jiang Yanli is watching him, soft and a little knowing.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying...does not always make it easy,\u201d he says, and Jiang Yanli hums a quiet sound, maybe amused by his honesty. \u201cBut he will always have me, for as long as he will allow it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli nods, a little fiercely. \u201cGood. He does not always realize...A-Xian, he\u2026\u201d She swallows, blinks away for a moment, then looks at Lan Wangji again, much more severe than a moment ago. Steady, almost arresting, a flash of steel he has not seen before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian would throw himself onto a pyre, if it meant he could keep others warm,\u201d she says. Quiet, but deliberate. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will ever understand that it isn\u2019t something required of him.\u201d Her gaze slides away from him, settles somewhere distant. \u201cIt will be...good, to have someone pull him away from the flame. When A-Cheng and I cannot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods once, emphatic. He knows precisely what she means. \u201cYou have my word, Jiang-guniang.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli visibly relaxes, the tension easing from her frame. She sags a little, her exhaustion suddenly evident.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-guniang should rest,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. He hopes it isn\u2019t too forward, but thinks it may be allowed, after this conversation. \u201cI will stay with Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, worrying her lip with her teeth as she looks anxiously at her brother. \u201cIf he needs anything, what if I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he shows any signs of change, I will fetch you,\u201d Lan Wangji assures her, and Jiang Yanli wilts a little more, then muffles a yawn with the back of her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Lan er-gongzi,\u201d she says, rising and dipping her head. \u201cFor everything. For these past few days, and before, and everything that will come after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji spends a long time, after Jiang Yanli leaves, staring at Wei Ying, not touching. Wei Ying\u2019s still, unmoving features instill a sick dread in him that he can\u2019t uncoil. Wei Ying should never \u2014 look like this. Lan Wangji should never see him this way.</p>\n<p>He gives the thread a tug with his spiritual energy, and watches as Wei Ying\u2019s wrist jerks limply in reply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying does not answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d Hesitantly at first, then with growing stubbornness, Lan Wangji says, \u201cIf you do not wake soon, I...I will bother you every day, like you did me, when we were young.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gives another sharp pull to illustrate his point. No response.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sleeps on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two more days pass, and then:</p>\n<p>The following morning, when Lan Wangji arrives for a guqin session, Jiang Yanli ushers him inside and Wei Ying is awake. Not only awake, but sitting up in bed, his hands folded in his lap with strange docility as he pointedly avoids Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji appraises Wei Ying with an intensity he knows will not escape Jiang Yanli\u2019\u2019s notice, as he tries to physically assess the remaining damage, signs of weakness \u2014 as he drinks in the movements of Wei Ying animate and alert. The relief that pulses through him is palpable, tangled up with an odd current of anxiety. Why won\u2019t Wei Ying look at him, even now?</p>\n<p>Perhaps sensing the peculiar tension between them, Jiang Yanli quietly excuses herself a moment later, leaving the two of them alone with a strangely awkward silence between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and his mind promptly blanks. Should he ask how Wei Ying is feeling? Admit he\u2019s glad that Wei Ying is awake? Tell Wei Ying, desperate and raw, <em> Never do that again</em>?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying replies, and the greeting is oddly empty. Wei Ying offers him a tired, humorless smile that doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are awake,\u201d Lan Wangji says, which \u2014 is not the best of the options he had been considering, but it is at least to the point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Wei Ying agrees. \u201cI understand I have you to thank for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe damage to your spiritual core was severe,\u201d Lan Wangji says, pointed enough that Wei Ying flares a look toward him that is suspicious, maybe exasperated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m so resilient, then,\u201d Wei Ying says, and directs a friendly smile at Lan Wangji that somehow still manages to feel chilled. Lan Wangji feels his fists clench at the blas\u00e9 tone. Does Wei Ying truly not realize how close he was to death?</p>\n<p>\u201cThe resentment,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He cannot explain to Wei Ying, in words, the feeling of watching him lie lifeless; the haunt of the knowledge that it might happen again, permanently \u2014 \u201cWei Ying. It will only continue to worsen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any openness in Wei Ying\u2019s expression slams shut, an instant shuttering.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Wei Ying says coolly. \u201cI feel fine now. Great, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji persists.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, Lan Zhan.\u201d Wei Ying is detached now, hard-edged. \u201cAre you so fond of meddling with everyone else, or is it just me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust you,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps, a whip-crack of honesty before he can stop himself, and this does seem to surprise Wei Ying \u2014 he blinks, some of the hostility in his expression tempering.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says again, a little softer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you stop pulling the thread?\u201d Clumsily, too quickly, the question is unearthed before Lan Wangji can bury it again; a knotty root torn from the underground, exposed and bare.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying just blinks at him again, his mouth slightly parted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, after a beat.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows, tightens one fist until his knuckles hurt. \u201cYou stopped pulling the thread, these months,\u201d he says, quietly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying tilts his head, appraising Lan Wangji with evident bemusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan, I can\u2019t right now,\u201d Wei Ying says, and holds up his wrist to demonstrate. \u201cNo spiritual energy, you see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut before,\u201d Lan Wangji presses.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying crosses his arms and observes him with unusual ambivalence. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t want to annoy you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not laugh as a general rule, but he almost does then, out of sheer disbelief. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying frowns. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell the truth,\u201d Lan Wangji orders, and he knows he\u2019s \u2014 coming on too strongly with his questions, more aggressive than what this subject should require, and Wei Ying responds in turn, sparking up like flint to steel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had other things to think about, Hanguang-jun, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d The words are bitter venom, his title a hidden knife, and it shouldn\u2019t hurt but it does, and Lan Wangji takes a wavering breath and turns to leave, because \u2014 what exactly is he doing here, again? Making Wei Ying hate him more? All of his intentions have misfired, been tangled and warped against him. He can\u2019t say anything he means to.</p>\n<p>But before he can, Wei Ying crosses the room in two quick bounds and anchors a hand to his shoulder. It is not harsh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Wei Ying says, more jaggedly than before. \u201cWait, Lan Zhan, I. Ah, don\u2019t go, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates \u2014 he doesn\u2019t need Wei Ying\u2019s apology, but he hangs on Wei Ying\u2019s next words like a dog starved for meat, desperate for something from him, anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Wei Ying says. He sounds empty, his tone without inflection. He drops his hand. \u201cOf course you\u2019re right. My temper, it\u2019s...I lash out without meaning to, these days, I \u2014 you don\u2019t deserve it, you\u2019ve already put up with enough from me, and I\u2026\u201d He trails off, then says quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t leave it like this, not again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finally turns back to him, and Wei Ying\u2019s shoulders, too thin in his inner robe, have sunk into a downward slope. He still looks so tired, despite the days of rest.</p>\n<p>\u201cShijie told me you came and played for me,\u201d Wei Ying continues. He still won\u2019t meet Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes, his gaze lowered to the floor. \u201cI should have led with a thank you.\u201d And he salutes, too formal.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t need his gratitude, either. If they were something different to each other, he would tell Wei Ying not to thank him \u2014 that this kind of service is a given, something he wants to do, something he <em> needs </em>to do for both of their sakes. But he is not that, not to Wei Ying, not anything. Back in Jiangling, Wei Ying had referred to Lan Wangji as an other, a stranger. This is no different. Nothing has changed.</p>\n<p>Then, Wei Ying continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere I was,\u201d he whispers. His gaze is caught somewhere far away, beyond Lan Wangji, a haunting. \u201cIn those months. I could feel it. When you would pull the thread. Sometimes it was the only thing that reminded me I was alive and had something to come back to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a breath, unsteady and too loud for the quiet of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I suppose I owe you another thank you,\u201d Wei Ying finishes, and his eyes return to Lan Wangji, focused again and too bright.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Lan Wangji says, finally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates. He would trust Wei Ying with his life, but he does not trust that Wei Ying knows what\u2019s best for himself. He\u2019s not sure what that makes his answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust your integrity,\u201d he answers eventually. \u201cAnd your intentions. Do you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying watches him, his mouth snagging into a half-smile. \u201cI trust your integrity and your intentions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods. Some of the tension that has wired itself into his shoulders unspools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pushes out a long breath through his teeth, then runs a hand through his unwashed hair. \u201cThis soulmate stuff is hard, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not think it is always so hard for others,\u201d Lan Wangji observes. Circumstantially, he and Wei Ying are probably very extreme outliers.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying inhales, then gives a sharp nod, the curve of his mouth hardening into a flat line, strangely acerbic. Lan Wangji isn\u2019t certain how to read the expression, but has the sinking sense, as he often does these days when speaking with Wei Ying, that he has said the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wei Ying says, his face unreadable. A closed door, locked. \u201cThe thread isn\u2019t binding, right? I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you that you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him, tracking the shifting cloud cover of his expressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, and then, because it needs to be said: \u201cThis is something I take seriously. It will not always be easy, but you will have me, whether you want me or not. Do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s head snaps up, his eyes rounding like moons. His incredulity, too, is an ache; has Lan Wangji not made this fact clear enough to Wei Ying, until now?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The knot on Wei Ying\u2019s throat bobs, twice, as he swallows. He looks so much younger than a moment ago. \u201cDo you really mean that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s voice is as firm as he feels. \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d Wei Ying huffs out a hollow laugh, then shuts his eyes. \u201cAll of it, everything, I can feel it. It\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. So you should mark your words, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, and from Wei Ying, the ghost of a smile \u2014 faint, disbelieving, a little hopeful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the Sunshot Campaign formally concludes, several months pass before Lan Wangji sees Wei Ying again, although he sends letters and continues to pull at the thread. Despite their most recent conversation, Wei Ying never pulls back, so Lan Wangji assumes he must be busy with other more pressing matters.</p>\n<p>He too has kept occupied with sect responsibilities, with conferences and assisting his xiongzhang\u2019s leadership, so the trip to Lanling is almost a welcome reprieve, as much as Lan Wangji hates social gatherings, particularly with the gentries. But the Jin sect had formally invited the GusuLan, along with the other major sects, to participate in a hunt and competition at Phoenix Mountain, so he, Lan Xichen, and a bevy of Lan disciples make their way there now, riding quietly through sun-dappled roads and forests.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yao has put much effort into coordinating everything for today,\u201d Lan Xichen is saying, conversing easily with Lan Wangji\u2019s usual silence as they ride alongside each other. \u201cI have heard the YunmengJiang sect looks especially promising this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, noncommittal. He keeps his gaze fixed forward, his hands clenched on the reins of his mare.</p>\n<p>From his periphery, Lan Xichen slides him an amused, knowing look. \u201cPerhaps Wei-gongzi will be in attendance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite himself, Lan Wangji\u2019s heart skips a beat. He keeps his expression impassive.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is of no consequence,\u201d he says neutrally, and his xiongzhang just smiles, as though the response has satisfied him.</p>\n<p>When he and Lan Xichen ride in for the welcoming ceremony at Phoenix Mountain, tailed by the rest of the GusuLan disciples, they clop their way through a rainfall of white flowers. He can hear the women audibly sighing over him and his xiongzhang as they pass, cooing this and that about their handsome appearances, and he ignores it to the best of his ability. He is accustomed to this kind of treatment, but no more comfortable for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he suddenly hears a familiar voice tell one of the women nearby. \u201cThey\u2019re both equally handsome, but wouldn\u2019t you say Hanguang-jun is a particular beauty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d the young woman agrees enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cHear that, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying calls to him with a loud, unbridled laugh while Lan Wangji\u2019s heart pounds away madly in his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re the prettiest in all the sects!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head and purses his lips, ignoring the sudden warmth in his ears. He can feel xiongzhang smiling in his direction where he rides alongside him, as close as he ever gets to a smug grin.</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying capers up to trot beside his horse, and Lan Wangji can\u2019t <em> not </em>look at him now, especially when he\u2019s drawing so much obvious attention.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wei Wuxian</em>!\u201d he hears Jiang Cheng shout behind them, who sounds as though he\u2019s about to burst an artery.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying ignores his brother entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says with an exaggerated pout, his eyes sparking with mischief. He easily keeps pace with the horse. \u201cYou\u2019re so cruel that you won\u2019t even look at your devoted admirers? All of these lovely young maidens are weeping themselves to sleep at night for the love of Hanguang-jun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Wei-gongzi,\u201d Lan Xichen says from next to Lan Wangji, with pointed amusement, and Wei Ying hardly looks in his direction, offering a half-hearted salute with his hands as he keeps walking, his eyes fastened to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-jun,\u201d Wei Ying says, still without looking at Lan Xichen. \u201cZewu-jun, won\u2019t you tell your Hanguang-jun to spare this humble one a glance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen says, playing along because he is, evidently, a demon. \u201cWon\u2019t you indulge Wei-gongzi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does not need more indulging,\u201d Lan Wangji says coolly, then ignores the heart palpitations as Wei Ying laughs with open delight.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine, he\u2019s right,\u201d Wei Ying says gamely, still grinning. \u201cStill, Lan er-gongzi, won\u2019t you accept this token of my affection?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s attention redirects to where Wei Ying is holding a white peony in his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fingers knot tighter on the reins of his horse. \u201cRidi\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know, ridiculous, ludicrous, frivolous, shameless, did I get it right?\u201d Wei Ying asks, and Lan Wangji purses his lips and glares down at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying winks back, then says, \u201cFine, you won\u2019t accept it? I\u2019ll put it here for safekeeping,\u201d and then tucks it into the front of his own robes, close to his heart. \u201cNow you can come and take it whenever you like. Good luck on the hunt, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he scampers away, back to the YunmengJiang formation, leaving Lan Wangji flushing furiously in his wake.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he likes you, didi,\u201d Lan Xichen says, with droll humor.</p>\n<p>The archery competition functions as a prelude to the hunt, and it goes relatively quickly. Cultivators from each sect go one after the other, starting with QingheNie and ending with the hosts, LanlingJin.</p>\n<p>While the QingheNie cultivators shoot, Wei Ying saunters over to Lan Wangji again, crowding too close into his space, and says, \u201cHey, Lan Zhan, can I borrow your forehead ribbon for something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-gongzi,\u201d his xiongzhang says with a pained laugh. \u201cOur ribbons...ah, they \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother, xiongzhang,\u201d Lan Wangji says irritably, keeping his gaze fixed forward. \u201cHe knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nudges Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder and grins, close and overconfident and so beautiful that Lan Wangji, before he can stop himself, pictures pinning him to the ground and shutting up that laughing tease of a mouth \u2014 of kissing Wei Ying with such force that he can\u2019t breathe, let alone speak.</p>\n<p>The urge is \u2014 sudden and shocking and involuntary, firework-bright and just as searing. Lan Wangji snaps his head forward, swallowing hard and fixing his expression into one of rigid distaste. It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t...imagined that before. Several times. It\u2019s just the first time his impulses have almost bettered him, with Wei Ying so near to him, and so \u2014 publicly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine, Lan er-gongzi, I\u2019ll take a hint,\u201d Wei Ying says with exaggerated offense, then he runs off back to Jiang Cheng\u2019s side, untying the ribbon from his wrist-guard as he goes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji relaxes, some of the hot tension melting away from him, and resolves to stay away from Wei Ying for the rest of the hunt \u2014 lest he do something he regrets, after all these months apart. Their last interaction had ended well, but had been fraught with tension in the leadup, so being confronted with a playful Wei Ying in high spirits, as Lan Wangji had first come to know him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s doing unexpected things to him.</p>\n<p>The disciples from other sects perform admirably, as do Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen, but nowhere in the same league as Wei Ying, who swaggers this way and that with a cocksure smile and a black blindfold tied around his head. It\u2019s completely shameless behavior, bordering on tacky, but Lan Wangji finds himself sweating over it regardless, his mouth too dry.</p>\n<p>After Wei Ying\u2019s last (flawless) shot, Lan Wangji hears, an undercurrent to the cheers, some low mutters that sweep like a dark wind through the gathered crowds; acidic whispers about Wei Ying\u2019s missing sword, the dark energy that he has been known to call with Chenqing, the horrific nature of deaths in the supervisory offices. Just months ago, they had sung Wei Ying\u2019s praises for bringing Wen Chao so low, when it suited their purposes, Lan Wangji reflects bitterly, keeping his grip on Bichen tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Wei Wuxian cultivates the ghostly path,\u201d he hears a nearby Jin cultivator murmur to another, and Lan Wangji turns to scowl in their direction until they fall quiet with fearful looks. Lan Xichen also tilts his head toward them, clearly listening even as his face gives nothing away.</p>\n<p>It is not the first time Lan Wangji has heard such rumors. They\u2019re not untrue, after all; he had seen it himself at both of their reunions, first in Jiangling and then at Nightless City. And Wei Ying had shown no interest in returning to the orthodox path, both times Lan Wangji had tried to reason with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cXiongzhang,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly as they make their way with the rest of the Lan disciples to the starting grounds of the hunt. \u201cHas there ever been a case where...the red thread has been wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t that his feelings for Wei Ying have abated. Not even a little. (Clearly.) But the more and more markedly their paths diverge, the more doubt creeps in like a slow-growing ivy. Additionally, Wei Ying\u2019s own...feelings seem to be much more neutral, when it comes to Lan Wangji. Beyond the obvious flirting, which Lan Wangji suspects is more of Wei Ying\u2019s meaningless teasing.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen turns to look at him, pursing his lips with something like pity.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut choice is still available to you, Wangji, regardless of the thread. If...if you do not agree with Wei-gongzi\u2019s path, you are not obligated to follow him on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks silently ahead into the trees, a tight feeling hardening in his throat. That isn\u2019t what he meant at all, but he thinks articulating that to his brother would be unwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur family\u2019s luck with the red thread has not been kind,\u201d Lan Xichen continues, soft enough so they won\u2019t be overheard, and Lan Wangji swallows.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the hunt starts, and the GusuLan disciples set off in a large group, but Lan Wangji splits off from them with a quiet word to Lan Xichen. He wants the space and the silence to think. He manages to catch a fair amount of prey on his own, but his heart isn\u2019t in it, so he doesn\u2019t perform as well as he would under normal circumstances. His thoughts turn in circles around Wei Ying and only Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>When he treks deeper into the woods, further up the mountain, he catches the distant whistle of a dizi floating on the breeze, and by instinct, he follows the sound.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji finds him not long after.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is leaned up against a tree, angled diagonally out of the ground. He looks relaxed, unthreatened, Chenqing twirling deftly in his fingers. Lan Wangji feels a frisson of heat shiver through him, and almost involuntarily, he takes one step closer. Then two.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji <em> does </em> intend to greet him, especially when Wei Ying audibly perks up at the sound of his approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then he...doesn\u2019t, choosing to stay silent for reasons that escape his self-understanding. Curious, maybe, to see how Wei Ying will interact with him when he\u2019s unaware of his identity.</p>\n<p>Chenqing stills in Wei Ying\u2019s fingers, although he does not move from the tree, keeping his relaxed pose.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere for the hunt?\u201d Wei Ying asks in his direction \u2014 unmistakably friendly, even though he has plenty of enemies here that could mean to kill him. As always, Wei Ying\u2019s self-preservation leaves much to be desired.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still wearing the blindfold from the archery competition, his lips curled up in an eager smirk. Verging on lofty. Still so at ease, one arm propped behind his head. As he makes his way closer, Lan Wangji\u2019s heart starts to pound, picking up on a surge of adrenaline.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy so quiet?\u201d Wei Ying teases to Lan Wangji\u2019s silence. \u201cHow am I supposed to know if you\u2019re a friend or foe, mystery stranger?\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, Lan Wangji isn\u2019t sure which part of himself to blame. His patience and self-restraint finally fraying; the dark hunger that hollows out in his stomach, at the sight of Wei Ying beautiful and lax and oddly vulnerable; the traitorous, selfish part of himself that whispers, <em> This is your only chance. </em>It could be any of those things, and none suffice for excuses. But the truth of it is that, in the moment, Lan Wangji just knows he needs to \u2014 touch him, whatever form that may take.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a startled sound as Lan Wangji pushes him down harder against the tree, capturing both of his wrists easily in one hand and pinning them. Perceiving an attack now, Wei Ying starts to look faintly alarmed; he struggles and reaches for his talismans, but Lan Wangji pins him harder so he\u2019s immobilized, a thrill coursing through him when Wei Ying gasps and submits to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This has already careened wildly out of Lan Wangji\u2019s control, further than he ever intended to take it, but it\u2019s too late to take anything back now, his body moving ahead of his rationality, ahead of his reminders of decorum and sect precepts and \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens his mouth to \u2014 to what? To protest? To call for help? \u2014 and Lan Wangji finally gives into the tide of it. He leans in, far too clumsily, and crashes their mouths together.</p>\n<p>Beyond the initial flare of sensation \u2014 of Wei Ying\u2019s lips against his, sudden and slick and hot \u2014 Lan Wangji notices this first: Wei Ying stiffening under him, going rigid with shock. His breathing stops entirely, his lips frozen beneath Lan Wangji\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is shaking so hard that he\u2019s certain Wei Ying can feel it; he\u2019s certain he\u2019s already given himself away, in some way or another. He had known, as he\u2019d initiated, that this would be entirely selfish, a one-sided theft, a taking rather a mutual contract. He had known, and he had still taken, for the sheer fact that he wanted. Selfishly, selfishly, selfishly, he kisses Wei Ying, the silken soft of his mouth even more overwhelming than anything he\u2019d pictured.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still unmoving, his lips too pliant against his. Letting him take. No, this isn\u2019t at all right. Lan Wangji moves to pull away, an overpowering sense of shame catching up with him like a head rush, and then \u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014 Wei Ying\u2019s lips move, responding to Lan Wangji\u2019s, and he\u2019s...not resisting. He hadn\u2019t ever resisted, Lan Wangji realizes. Wei Ying makes a small sound against Lan Wangji\u2019s lips, his mouth still parted from before, and almost experimentally, he pushes back into the kiss, a tentative nip to Lan Wangji\u2019s lower lip.</p>\n<p>The dark voice from before rushes into Lan Wangji\u2019s ears like a high tide: <em> This is all you will ever have.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji presses Wei Ying harder onto the tree, so hard it creaks beneath their weight, and his tongue slips between the seam of Wei Ying\u2019s parted lips. Wei Ying makes a definite sound to that, a small, hitched moan as Lan Wangji\u2019s tongue fucks into his mouth\u00a0 \u2014 Lan Wangji is too desperate for precision, too focused on committing every detail he can to memory so he won\u2019t forget. They\u2019re properly kissing now, the slick sounds of their lips catching, again and again, startling and loud in the forest quiet. Wei Ying twists his head slightly sideways, perhaps trying to catch his breath, but suddenly terrified he\u2019ll break away, Lan Wangji angles his face back, rolls Wei Ying\u2019s lower lip between his teeth in a sharp bite.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying kisses him for a moment longer before the movement of his lips becomes more purposeful, shaped around muffled sounds, and Lan Wangji realizes he\u2019s trying to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pulls back when he realizes, a little confused but mostly terrified as to what he might hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Wei Ying is gasping, panting for breath. His mouth, shiny with spit, is a shock of red against the black blindfold. He tilts his head against the bark of the tree, dazed. \u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps his wrists tacked to the tree trunk, frozen to the spot. One wrong move, one breath could give him away, but he waits carefully, regardless, to hear Wei Ying out, as he keeps statue-still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m flattered, I really am,\u201d Wei Ying stammers, \u201cand this was really \u2014 ah, nice and all, but I already have \u2014 I\u2019m already promised to \u2014 someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him, his gaze flickering over the details of Wei Ying this close \u2014 the high pink flush in his cheeks, his throat working, his mouth still parted and panting. Does he mean\u2026?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can check my wrist if you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Wei Ying says, circling his right wrist under Lan Wangji\u2019s tight grasp and wiggling his fingers, and Lan Wangji is suddenly overwhelmed with the urge to bury his face in Wei Ying\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he still...so he still \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying attempts to move, perhaps uncomfortable with the silence or the position, and Lan Wangji panics \u2014 he yanks the peony from the front of Wei Ying\u2019s robes, mounts Bichen, and flees as fast as his cultivation will allow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Wei Ying finds him not long after, in the middle of enacting violence on a copse of harmless trees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of <em> course </em>Wei Ying would find him here, in this state and situation, because Lan Wangji\u2019s luck relating to anything involving Wei Ying is exceptionally poor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa! Lan Zhan!\u201d Wei Ying calls when he sees him, then he yelps just as there\u2019s a particularly loud crack and a large branch crashes to the forest floor.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji whirls to glare at him, almost curling his lip. Wei Ying shrinks back from his anger, his eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Go,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji says through his teeth, but Wei Ying steadily ignores the command, frowning as he moves closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks, then makes an exaggerated display of surveying the destruction around them. \u201cWhat did these poor trees ever do to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStay away from me,\u201d Lan Wangji snaps in his panic \u2014 he doesn\u2019t mean it, not really, but if Wei Ying gets too close, he might realize something off with Lan Wangji\u2019s expression. Wei Ying is too bright for both of their own goods; the truth of the situation isn\u2019t hard to guess, given Lan Wangji\u2019s obvious discomposure, his likely-ruined mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were past this point,\u201d Wei Ying complains, but stops regardless, appraising Lan Wangji with perplexed concern.</p>\n<p>For a long while, they stare at each other. Lan Wangji can feel that his lips are still buzzing with warmth, a little raw and stinging. Although he has been informed endlessly of his own inscrutability, he isn\u2019t sure what his own face gives away\u00a0\u2014 if there\u2019s a blush to match the lingering heat in his cheeks. Wei Ying\u2019s lips are slightly swollen, his chin rubbed red with friction and his eyes tearing up into the sunlight after the blindfold. Lan Wangji can\u2019t stop staring \u2014 one, because Wei Ying looks wrecked; two, because <em> he </em>had done that. And three: He wants to do it again, right now, for much longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying says, and for a brief moment, he looks uncharacteristically self-conscious. He crosses one of his arms to rub the other. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lan Wangji says, turning away too quickly and stalking off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, Wei Ying follows him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wei Ying asks, right on his heels. He grabs at Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist, maybe aiming to check his spiritual energy, but Lan Wangji yanks his hand away. His pulse is still racing, far too quickly to not be suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really okay, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying asks, a frown in his voice as he continues to trail closely behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying grabs at Lan Wangji\u2019s arm again to stop him from going further, then yanks hard so that Lan Wangji turns to face him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou always say you\u2019re fine,\u201d Wei Ying points out. \u201cEven when you\u2019re clearly not. Listen, we\u2019re \u2014 you don\u2019t have to \u2014\u201d Then he sighs and bites his lip, his lashes downcast.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re what?\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one to say it,\u201d Wei Ying mutters, still looking away from him. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lowers his voice, more insistent. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Wei Ying says with another sigh, and finally looks up at him, his mouth firming and his brows pulling together. \u201cWhat even am I to you? You act like you hate me sometimes, and I wouldn't even blame you, but I can still \u2014 I can still feel it when you pull the thread, so I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t get it at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows, his chest clenching. \u201cI do not hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m glad to hear <em> that,</em>\u201d Wei Ying replies, throwing up one hand in wry exasperation before he wearily pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou really know how to sweet-talk a girl, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, I do not hate you,\u201d Lan Wangji insists, almost pleading. He cannot allow himself to speak the inverse, the truth, not without giving everything of himself away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying says slowly, observing Lan Wangji\u2019s pained expression with a small frown. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you either. So where does that leave us? I still \u2014 \u201d He scuffs his shoe in the dirt, grimacing as though he\u2019s tasted something especially bitter, before he seems to steel himself and continues, \u201cI still take you as my soulmate, you know. Even if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks, then says, emphatic, \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying snaps his head up to look at him, his eyes rounding. \u201cYou \u2014 oh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get a chance to finish, because voices interrupt them \u2014 muffled, but distinctly familiar, not far off at all. A woman\u2019s, soft and appeasing; then a man\u2019s, much harsher, both engaged in a tense conversation.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying visibly pales, his head snapping toward the sound. \u201cShijie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Lan Wangji can say another word, Wei Ying takes off in the direction of the voices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, and then, of course, he follows.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b>Six months later</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Lan Zhan?\u201d Lan Wangji hears Wei Ying before he sees him. His head snaps up, the surrounding crowds thin away, and there he is, directing an incredulous smile at Lan Wangji across the distance between them, so sudden and real that Lan Wangji has to blink a few times to ensure he isn\u2019t a hallucination.</p>\n<p>Time slows, honeyed and sweet, as Wei Ying walks toward him, beaming ear to ear. Sound hollows out for a suspended moment.</p>\n<p>Then the bawling howls filter back in, as well as the disapproving chatter of the surrounding crowds, and Lan Wangji is pulled back abruptly to the scene at hand, the one that Wei Ying must be witnessing: There\u2019s an unfamiliar child burred to his leg, screaming to the high heavens for his a-die.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, break it up,\u201d Wei Ying scolds the rubberneckers as he stops in front of Lan Wangji. \u201cAi, you bunch of vultures. Leave this man to his terrible parenting in peace!\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd mutters darkly at his interference but disperses, leaving just the two of them. Well, three of them. The child will not stop sobbing, full-bodied and shuddering.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, helpless to say anything else. It has been months since he\u2019s seen Wei Ying\u2019s face, or heard the teasing lilt of his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Months since Wei Ying had nearly lost his control in a confrontation with Jin Zixuan and his cousin at the Phoenix Mountain night hunt. (It had taken both Lan Wangji and Jiang Yanli to calm him down, and after, Wei Ying had departed without so much as a farewell.)</p>\n<p>Months since Wei Ying had rescued Wen refugees from Qiongqi Path, and had settled with them in the Burial Mounds \u2014 since he had, more or less, renounced all formal ties to the cultivation world. (Every day, the criticism from the cultivational sects worsens, and every day, Lan Wangji worries.)</p>\n<p>It has been months since Lan Wangji had stolen a kiss that did not belong to him. (He has thought of it every day since.)</p>\n<p>And \u2014 here he is, a little ragged-looking and unkempt, perhaps thinner than they last parted, but still beautifully, wholly Wei Ying. The red thread seems to delight at the proximity, after all this time, because it crystallizes into color in the afternoon sunlight, filling out near-solidly between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says in a faux-chiding voice, wagging his finger. His obvious glee at this situation is poorly concealed. \u201cIs this any way to treat your son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is not mine,\u201d Lan Wangji insists, strangely flustered. The child howls louder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he isn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Ying replies, flashing his teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just stares, uncomprehending, as Wei Ying scoops down to pick up the child with soothing sounds.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying tells the child, whose face is a wet mask of snot and tears. \u201cWhat have I said about running off? What have I said about harassing mean and pretty strangers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches the two of them, slightly unmoored. An odd, acidic feeling knots in his stomach. Wei Ying has a child? With...someone else? Since when? With whom?</p>\n<p>Wei Ying adjusts the boy on his hip when he turns to look at Lan Wangji, as naturally as anything, and a nameless emotion repositions itself inside Lan Wangji at the sight, like a log shifting on a hearth. Odd, tender, strangely longing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy \u2014 A-Yuan, as Wei Ying had called him \u2014 has quieted somewhat now that Wei Ying is holding him, just the occasional hiccuped sob or sniffle. His tiny hands dig into the front of Wei Ying\u2019s hanfu, twisting the coarse fabric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour <em> face, </em>Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says with a soft cackle, his eyes crinkling. \u201cOf course he\u2019s not mine, dummy. Do I look like father material to you?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Yes, </em>a voice rings out inside Lan Wangji, plaintive and honest.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sets A-Yuan down, taking his hand in one of his and tugging at Lan Wangji\u2019s in the other. They start to walk, Lan Wangji towed along in his wake.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, what a coincidence that we should run into each other here,\u201d Wei Ying says, sliding him a curious look sideways. \u201cWhat brings you to Yiling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had been picking up insignificant night hunts around Yiling for the past month. He had told his shufu and the elders it was to aid the locals of Yiling and the surrounding areas. His true reasons are not so selfless.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight hunt,\u201d he says. \u201cPassing through.\u201d</p>\n<p>The child is still crying, albeit more softly than before. The brief separation from Wei Ying \u2014 either that, or Lan Wangji\u2019s presence \u2014 must have deeply upset him.</p>\n<p>To make amends, Lan Wangji buys him a toy. Then two, then four, then six as they continue to wander through the packed streets of town. He buys them as much for the boy as he does for Wei Ying, who lights up at each one with a giddy, childlike delight that mirrors A-Yuan\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had grown up cushioned by the ever-present comfort of money, so he and his xiongzhang had never been denied anything, in this regard. Lan Wangji had not been a frivolous child with a need for toys, but his family\u2019s financial capacity had never once been in doubt. Wei Ying, he knows, has never had that material assurance. Each new toy that Lan Wangji gives A-Yuan, Wei Ying reacts as though he\u2019s been given something himself.</p>\n<p>No, Lan Wangji was not a materialistic child, but he has a faint memory of walking through a market just like this with his brother\u2019s hand in his, somewhere in Gusu close to the sea. The day was saltwater-blue and they had stopped to buy sweets. He had watched, curious, as Lan Huan discreetly purchased a rattle toy from a nearby stall, then tucked it out of sight into his robes. The reasons behind the odd transaction were unclear to Lan Zhan, but of course he did not remark on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two days later, during their monthly visit to the Gentian House, his mother had given Lan Zhan the rattle toy as a present in the gardens, while his brother had watched behind them, beaming and his hands clasped together. Lan Wangji had kept it until it had burned, along with almost everything else in the jingshi, during the Wens\u2019 attack on the Cloud Recesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps one day, A-Yuan can also remember this, Lan Wangji thinks \u2014 a distant comfort he can keep close in a world that has clearly treated him with cruelty, even this early in his young life.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan, what do we say to Rich-gege?\u201d Wei Ying is coaching A-Yuan as they continue to walk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Rich-gege!\u201d A-Yuan chirps, his eyes shining, and Lan Wangji feels something thaw out in him, a chrysalis of ice he hadn\u2019t even realized was there. In its wake flows that curious yearning he\u2019d experienced earlier, when he\u2019d watched Wei Ying hold A-Yuan on his hip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has always liked children, though admittedly he has not been around many. He had never considered marriage or a family until Wei Ying, and even then, up until now, it has felt like some absurd, unattainable fantasy, despite the red thread. Circumstances have always been too extreme, or strained; Wei Ying has always been slightly out of his grasp, dodging too quickly for Lan Wangji to hold him still.</p>\n<p>Now that he knows this want, it aches in him dangerously. It beats as wild as hope, thrashes its wings like a pinned sparrow. He wants, wants, wants Wei Ying, he wants a child, this child, he wants the family that he and his brother had never had.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re quiet,\u201d Wei Ying observes, appraising him with concern as they continue to wander. \u201cI mean, you know. Quieter than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, afraid to say anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, listen,\u201d Wei Ying says, and stops them, his fingers encircling Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist again. \u201cHow about you throw over your night hunt, huh? I\u2019m familiar with most things going on in the area and trust me, there\u2019s nothing significant enough to need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji admonishes, entirely without heat.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sweeps on, undeterred. \u201cSo get rid of your night hunt and come eat with us. We can, I don\u2019t know, talk about our old days. My treat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Come eat with them? Lan Wangji\u2019s thoughts scramble, both at the notion and at Wei Ying looking at him so openly, so earnestly, and before he can overthink it, his mouth is already moving.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, and Wei Ying beams and hauls him away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re only halfway into their meal when something goes awry back at the Burial Mounds, and Lan Wangji has to bundle both Wei Ying and A-Yuan up onto his sword and fly them back. As it turns out, Wei Ying\u2019s progress with reanimating Wen Ning had encountered a violent hitch, and it takes the better part of a shichen to settle everything down again.</p>\n<p>By the time it does, Wei Ying\u2019s capering high spirits from the marketplace have dissipated. His expression is smooth and hollow, frosted over as he makes the rounds around camp to check wards, to discuss something quietly with Wen Qing. A-Yuan has been whisked away to the elders, where they fuss over him and ply him with radishes on the far side of camp. Lan Wangji stands in the center of camp and waits, as out of place as a pearl in a bed of coal. The Wens regard him with curiosity that\u2019s a little wary, no doubt recognizing him by his clothes and his ribbon, but they keep their distance.</p>\n<p>By now, the afternoon has shifted into an early dusk, the brittle soil cooling beneath his feet. Dusk is gray here in the Burial Mounds, watery and colorless.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying eventually rejoins him without a word. There\u2019s a lingering redness in his pupils, gathering in the whites of his eyes. Black spindles still cling to his clothes, whispering in his wake as Wei Ying silently leads Lan Wangji into a large cave at the center of camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dozens of candles and a few paper lanterns have been lit across various surfaces, casting the black rock contours of the cave\u2019s interiors to bronze and orange. It is a nice, homey touch, even for such a bleak setting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re really here, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying asks coolly, turning on one heel to face him, his arms clasped behind his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Lan Wangji answers. \u201cA night hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought false words were prohibited,\u201d Wei Ying quips with a tilt of his head. Not quite harsh, but cutting nonetheless.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Lan Wangji had picked a small night hunt in Yiling to pursue. It\u2019s just that his purpose behind it had been self-interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice even. \u201cI came for a night hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d Wei Ying muses, his eyes flashing. \u201cNot to keep a watchful eye on your resentment-using, fear-mongering, reputation-destroying soulmate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps his face still, unmoving. He had, but not for the reasons Wei Ying apparently believes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I believe you, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, directing them further into the cave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, the mood has certainly shifted. Wei Ying always cools in temperature considerably after using large amounts of resentment, but Lan Wangji had noticed the change the moment they\u2019d stepped foot into the Wen camp. It\u2019s something about this place, the Burial Mounds, that carves Wei Ying into this new shape, into a figure resembling what the cultivation world expects from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought I\u2019d give you a grand tour of the place,\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s voice echoes out around the cave, dripping with sarcasm.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji simply nods and follows after Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s all of it,\u201d Wei Ying says with a sweeping, sardonic flap of his tattered sleeve. A few of Wei Ying\u2019s inventions are scattered across the stones. There is a long slab of rock that\u2019s been fashioned into a bed in the far corner, the hard surface overlaid with a straw pallet as a makeshift mattress. At the west edge of the cave sits a pool brimming with a rich, crimson liquid. It exudes a rusted, metallic scent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Blood Pool,\u201d Wei Ying says when he follows Lan Wangji\u2019s questioning gaze. \u201cYeah, really adds to the ambiance, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, pained. He doesn\u2019t know how to put into words what he\u2019s feeling, but Wei Ying no doubt senses it because he shoots him a flat, humorless smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says, in that vacant and detached tone that Lan Wangji has really come to hate. \u201cIt\u2019s not all so bad, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, because that\u2019s what he imagines he is supposed to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to pity me,\u201d Wei Ying adds, with a harder edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Lan Wangji responds, and Wei Ying sighs and leads him deeper into the cave, closer to the bed.</p>\n<p>Clearly, effort had gone into welcoming Lan Wangji, with the lit candles and Wei Ying\u2019s belongings and clothes tucked out of sight. There are two small cups of water set out on a flat surface that could function as a table. It makes Lan Wangji\u2019s chest ache in a strange, small way.</p>\n<p>There are also talismans dangling from various surfaces \u2014 protective wards that Lan Wangji recognizes, as well as some of Wei Ying\u2019s more alternative inventions. There are a few others closer to the entrance that are unfamiliar to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, more quietly from behind him. \u201cThank you for today. For the meal, for making A-Yuan happy. For following me to help us here. I feel as though I owe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou owe me nothing,\u201d Lan Wangji assures him firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would give you something in return,\u201d Wei Ying continues, then gives a bleak laugh and waves a weary hand to indicate his surroundings. \u201cBut as you can see, there isn\u2019t much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji insists. He isn\u2019t fully capable of keeping the dismay from his voice. \u201cYou owe me nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A ripple of red flares in Wei Ying\u2019s eyes. Spidery tendrils of resentment curl up from his clothes like black, grasping fingers. \u201cWhy? Surely you must have a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>It must be the resentment\u2019s effects speaking. In the market today, they had at the very least been friends.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the physical, concrete proof of that tether between them will be enough to remind Wei Ying of their obligation to each other, to settle the twisting reach of resentful energy. So Lan Wangji says, \u201cWe have the red thread.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks, his expression going curiously hollow. He stares at Lan Wangji for another unending moment, in which Lan Wangji can read nothing from that emptiness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe red thread,\u201d Wei Ying says slowly. \u201cAh, I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>See what? Lan Wangji wonders. He watches uncertainly as, without another word, Wei Ying strides back to the cave\u2019s entrance and begins to pin up talismans to the rock. Lan Wangji follows him and bends over to examine one of the papers, frowning at the unfamiliar lines he finds.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, and suddenly Wei Ying has materialized by his side, leaning close into his space.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerimeter talisman that I made,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, a thrum of sound near his ear. A shiver ghosts across the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, pulling at the hair there. \u201cKeeps people out. And that one\u2019s a silencing talisman. I put them up so the Wens won\u2019t come in and bother us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns, his fingers moving away from the inked paper. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and finds Wei Ying watching him with a sharp, simmering focus, an expression he has not seen before. There\u2019s a purpose to it that Lan Wangji cannot quite identify, but the energy of it makes a sudden rash of sweat break out along his back, his palms.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan.\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s voice is so low, almost a purr, and he takes a step closer. Lan Wangji takes an answering step back.\u00a0 His heart skitters wildly in his chest, then pounds, faster and faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the rumors of the Yiling Laozu kidnapping helpless men and maidens to ravish them in his Demon-Slaughtering Cave?\u201d Wei Ying asks with a slow, suggestive tilt of his head. The candlelight sharpens the gaunter angles of his cheeks, burnishes the silver of his eyes to ember.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inside Lan Wangji, a glow of white heat pulses like a star, flaring outward as Wei Ying advances on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he rasps. He can\u2019t really mean to\u2026</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying pushes him \u2014\u00a0not forcefully, but none too gently, either \u2014 against the wall of the cave, and Lan Wangji sucks in a ragged inhale as Wei Ying drops to his knees. Wei Ying\u2019s messy bangs fall in his face as he tilts his chin to look up at Lan Wangji, ambivalent but with undisguised heat.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares back at him with wide eyes, his chest heaving. Surely this is another one of Wei Ying\u2019s pranks, pushed to \u2014 to completely inappropriate limits.</p>\n<p>But Wei Ying doesn\u2019t stop where the line would be, where the moment would arrive to break away laughing, to tease Lan Wangji over his reaction. No, his handsome face is unusually serious, his deft, callused fingers drifting up to work at Lan Wangji\u2019s belt, his multiple white layers. Lan Wangji finds himself frozen, his heartbeat in his mouth as he watches Wei Ying move as though out of body. He can\u2019t make himself stop Wei Ying even if he were to try, as helpless to the effects of Wei Ying\u2019s touch as he is, but surely this is not \u2014 this isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying doesn\u2019t pull down Lan Wangji\u2019s trousers, once he reaches them under the many layers of cloth. Instead, he hesitates \u2014 the first real flash of uncertainty Lan Wangji has seen since he\u2019s started \u2014 and then Wei Ying leans forward to mouth at the front of his trousers, sucking gently at the bulge that is rapidly firming by the second. The heat of his mouth, the damp of it, is overwhelming even through the fabric, and Lan Wangji chokes out a scraped sound, his hips canting forward and his head knocking back into the hard rock of the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he gasps out, one hand dropping to the back of Wei Ying\u2019s messy hair, and Wei Ying hums in reply, a pleased sound.</p>\n<p>He has to \u2014 stop this, Lan Wangji tells himself dizzily. He cannot allow this, no matter how much and for how long he has wanted. He won\u2019t allow Wei Ying to \u2014\u00a0to service him when Lan Wangji has never been further from knowing Wei Ying\u2019s thoughts. When they haven\u2019t even talked about \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji anchors a hand to Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder; not a rebuke, but a firm surrender.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pulls away, looks up at him through the dark fan of his lashes. His mouth is peony-red, spit-slick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot good?\u201d he asks, sounding apologetic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can only blink at him, a little flummoxed by the impossibility of this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he manages. \u201cV-very good, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares up at him from the cave floor, his expression smooth but his brow slightly pinched. Still on his knees, awaiting direction. Lan Wangji could crumble from it.</p>\n<p>But. He needs to ask. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying flinches a little as the question lands, as though it\u2019s settled into him somewhere unexpected. Then the corner of his mouth curves up, without mirth. A sudden twist of wrongness that Lan Wangji can feel, sour in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what we\u2019re supposed to do?\u201d Wei Ying asks, in this curiously empty voice, and then holds up his wrist in indication.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji recoils as though he\u2019s been slapped \u2014 subtly, but he does. He retracts from Wei Ying\u2019s touch, flattening himself further against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty much useless right now,\u201d Wei Ying continues, in that same awful voice, \u201cas a soulmate or otherwise, but I can do this, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji steps sideways, away from Wei Ying. He feels, at once, sick to his stomach.</p>\n<p>This, the kiss on Phoenix Mountain \u2014 it\u2019s all wrong, they\u2019re doing this wrong. This is not at all how Lan Wangji thought it was supposed to go. He cannot force Wei Ying to engineer feelings where they don\u2019t exist, as he has reminded himself painfully so many times before, but Lan Wangji would rather have nothing at all than this:<em>\u00a0</em>something forced and fabricated, for the sake of <em> humoring </em> him.</p>\n<p>He turns away from Wei Ying, flexing his fists in and out. He\u2019s still trembling with lingering adrenaline, and he finds he cannot stop.</p>\n<p>Then, after another moment of awful silence, a hand drops on his shoulder, surprisingly light. Nearly gentle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah,\u201d Wei Ying says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d \u2014 that it would upset you so much. Forgive me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Forgiveness is not a question, but Lan Wangji still takes a moment to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you think,\u201d Lan Wangji says with difficulty, still facing away from him. \u201cHow could you think that I would\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying repeats, with a marked increase in concern. Almost panicked. The hand on his shoulder tightens. \u201cLan Zhan, I didn\u2019t mean it, okay? We can forget that ever happened, let\u2019s just \u2014 put it behind us, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns to face him, and Wei Ying wilts a little when their eyes meet. The hollows under his eyes are stark, sunken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sorry, alright? I should have known that would \u2014 insult you, I just \u2014 run my mouth, and.\u201d Wei Ying seems to shrink smaller by degrees with each word, as though he\u2019s unpeeling layer after layer of armor from himself. It is the most tired, the most bare that Lan Wangji has seen him since they reunited.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying sighs, runs a hand tiredly over his face. Then in a quiet, defeated voice, he says, \u201cI just thought I could make it up to you somehow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him blankly. \u201cMake...it up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Wei Ying says, then makes a hand gesture that clarifies nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Wei Ying blows out a fast, agitated breath, his head cracking sideways. \u201cI mean, we both know the score here, right? You got stuck with me because of this whole stupid thread business and you never asked to be dragged into any of this shit. It isn\u2019t fair to you at all, not when you\u2019re so...you\u2019re so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just stares at Wei Ying, completely at a loss.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so <em> good,</em>\u201d Wei Ying finishes quietly. He closes his eyes, his jaw still angled away from Lan Wangji. \u201cYou deserve the red thread with someone who \u2014 I thought that, maybe...the least I could do was \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would choose you,\u201d Lan Wangji says, the words landing between them before he can think through it, and then he rests his tongue behind his teeth. Caught between the relief of having said it and wanting to pull the confession back into him, as Wei Ying blinks.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying turns to stare at him. His eyebrows brook together. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes one step closer to Wei Ying, and then another, closing the distance. Ah, he\u2019s still shaking, of course he is, like he had on the mountain. Tentatively, his hand floats up between them, a little aimless before it lands and fits to the shape of Wei Ying\u2019s cheek. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes flare wide at the contact, a burst of shock and a reaction without a name. Almost skittish, like something nocturnal scattering away from the light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying breathes, then his throat hitches on a little swallow. His voice is nearly gone, but he does not move away. He closes his eyes and leans his cheek into Lan Wangji\u2019s palm, but his eyebrows are crunched together as though the touch pains him. \u201cCan you \u2014 <em> don\u2019t, </em>if you don\u2019t \u2014 I, ah, please \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith or without the thread,\u201d Lan Wangi says, more firmly. The touch is a grounding, the thread a red wire in his periphery. \u201cI would choose Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>There, there it is, breathing out in the open now, the closest to a confession that Lan Wangji can manage. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes fly open, his mouth slightly ajar. His skin is so warm, silken under Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Wei Ying says. A little hollow, a little hopeful. \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen have I ever,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, a little impatiently, \u201csaid something I do not mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying moves then, so quickly that Lan Wangji blinks; he pushes Lan Wangji with a surprising amount of strength, given his current state \u2014 or perhaps Lan Wangji is rendered powerless, malleable in his surprise. One minute, Lan Wangji\u2019s hand is on Wei Ying\u2019s face, and the next, Wei Ying is slamming him against the cave wall again. Before the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s head can connect with the stone, Wei Ying\u2019s hand flies up to cushion it \u2014 a low hiss that Lan Wangji feels against his lips, to the scrape of his knuckles against the rock, and then Wei Ying is kissing him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s \u2014 different from the kiss on the mountain, different to be kissed than to initiate. Different, with Wei Ying unblindfolded, making his own choice. Wei Ying had been tentative then, exploratory and unsure. He kisses Lan Wangji now like he wants to claim him, humming desperate sounds each time their mouths connect, and it\u2019s all Lan Wangji can do not to buckle under the force of it, the heat of it that renders him boneless. Wei Ying kisses him like he wants him in return.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s experience is still woefully limited, but he gives it the best he has when he recovers his senses, after the initial shock: his hands in Wei Ying\u2019s hair, his tongue between Wei Ying\u2019s teeth. Some of it is too messy, miscalculated, their noses bumping and their teeth clicking together, but Wei Ying responds like a firestone, alighting further at each touch. They\u2019re both quick studies, and they teach each other as they go, different angles, pressures, applications of tongue to tongue, teeth to lip.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is already talking the moment he pulls away for air, saying, \u201cI should have asked,\u201d through gasps, \u201cjust before, and now, Lan Zhan, can I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, \u201c<em>yes</em>,\u201d and he does not recognize his voice as his own.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pulls his hand back from Lan Wangji\u2019s hair, a dark smear of blood across his scraped knuckles, and Lan Wangji grips the hand in his, raises it to his mouth, and under Wei Ying\u2019s stunned scrutiny, he licks the blood clean, careful swipes of his tongue as he looks up at Wei Ying through his lashes. Wei Ying\u2019s chest heaves, transfixed as he stares dark-eyed, and Lan Wangji has never felt so \u2014 alive. So desired.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying breathes, and they\u2019re kissing again, a coppery taste passed between their open mouths.</p>\n<p>There is certainly an aggression that slumbers deep in Lan Wangji. Patient, dark and lurking. It had terrified him when he was younger; it had pushed him over an unforgivable edge at Phoenix Mountain. He has thought of Wei Ying along the lines of this hunger, taking him apart in a hundred ways. But tonight, it\u2019s not what he wants. It\u2019s not what Wei Ying needs from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I be gentle?\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, slowing to press the words against Wei Ying\u2019s parted, panting mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pulls back, just slightly, to stare at him in confusion. \u201cI \u2014 I guess, what do you mean \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tucks a stray straggle of hair behind Wei Ying\u2019s ear, his thumb skimming the apple of his cheek, and he leans in to press a gentle kiss to Wei Ying\u2019s eyebrow, to the corner of his closed eye, the edge of his mouth. He uses one hand to cup the back of Wei Ying\u2019s neck, to angle his head how he wants, and the other to slip down along his back, a long, soothing stroke. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes are closed, his brow creased and his lips parted as though in pain. Lan Wangji nips another kiss to the shell of his ear, then tips Wei Ying\u2019s jaw back with his thumb so he can trail his lips down Wei Ying\u2019s throat, the soft sides of his neck, the carotid artery that beats in a high, wild thrum under his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s voice rings out breathlessly next to his ear. \u201cWait, wait, Lan Zhan, that\u2019s \u2014 ah, oh, it\u2019s harder than I thought.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pulls back to observe Wei Ying closely, the way he bites his lip and keeps his eyes squeezed shut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarder?\u201d he echoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like it hurts,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, then after another moment, he opens his eyes to peek warily at him, his pupils dilated.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to stop,\u201d he adds in a rush. \u201cYou...you shouldn\u2019t, even if it seems like I want you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow will I know when to stop?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. He feels dizzy; he cannot believe his own forwardness, the reality of the situation settling in.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I cry,\u201d Wei Ying says, and then offers a shaky smile, like a thin attempt at humor. \u201cIf I cry, honestly, you should be mean to me. Just absolutely ruthless, alright? Ah, I really hope I don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji runs a thumb along the high flush along Wei Ying\u2019s cheek, a little awed, and before he can tacitly agree, Wei Ying is moving back in, closing the distance, a bite to Lan Wangji\u2019s lower lip, and Lan Wangji loses the plot. Wei Ying starts to walk them backward with a pull against Lan Wangji\u2019s robes, his hands exploring the heavily layered lines of Lan Wangji\u2019s frame as he goes. Lan Wangji is dimly, peripherally aware that Wei Ying is directing them clumsily toward the bed. Their feet shuffle across the stone floor, stumbling and tripping into each other a few times, but neither of them think to break the kiss, blindly leading each other with mouths and hands.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is making harsh, wounded sounds against Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth, and Lan Wangji wonders when was the last time that Wei Ying had been touched with any care, with any tenderness. Had been touched with anything other than an intent to hurt. So Lan Wangji holds him like water in his hands, and kisses him and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Finally, when Wei Ying\u2019s knees hit the back of the stone bed, he tugs Lan Wangji so that they topple backwards onto it. It\u2019s possibly the least comfortable bedding Lan Wangji has ever felt, and it pains him, to think of Wei Ying sleeping here. He hovers over Wei Ying with his hands planted on either side of him, and then Wei Ying palms the back of his neck, pulling him down for another kiss.</p>\n<p>The direction of this is becoming increasingly apparent, as Lan Wangji sweats through his multiple layers even in the cool dark of the cave. He\u2019s been achingly hard for several minutes, since Wei Ying had first gone to his knees, and the burn of it festers restlessly under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this what you really\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji tries to say, and fails to finish the question because Wei Ying is doing something spectacular with his mouth along his collarbone. He needs Wei Ying to tell him this is something he wants. Not what he feels obligated to provide.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reads this from him, murmurs, \u201cYes,\u201d into the sensitive junction of his neck and collarbone, \u201c<em>God</em>, yes, Lan Zhan, I want you, I\u2019ve wanted you, how could you not tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d The sound comes out tiny and choked, only in part because Wei Ying has started to rub a clever thigh against his groin.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wants this. Wants him; at the very least, to have sex with him. For how long has he\u2026?</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pulls back to gnaw on his bottom lip, to look up at Lan Zhan with sudden, tenuous uncertainty. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 Lan Zhan, you\u2019re not just...please tell me this isn\u2019t to pity me or to, to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, some misplaced sense of chivalry to make me feel okay. Can you tell me if you \u2014 I sound stupid, but I need to know if \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cannot respond to this (admittedly convoluted) question with full honesty, because he suspects what he wants from Wei Ying far, far exceeds what they\u2019re currently doing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, he presses an open-mouthed kiss to Wei Ying\u2019s jaw, to his lips, and says, \u201cWant you, have always wanted you. How could Wei Ying not tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh,</em>\u201d Wei Ying says, and it sounds a little like a sob, or maybe a laugh. \u201cLan Zhan, you really...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much talking,\u201d Lan Wangji says, kissing him quiet again, and Wei Ying breaks away on another one of those hitched little laughs to thump Lan Wangji\u2019s back and say, with scalding fondness, \u201cBrat.\u201d</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s a brat between the two of them, it certainly isn\u2019t Lan Wangji, but he feels benevolent enough not to call Wei Ying on it, at least for the moment. On an unspoken agreement, they work together to peel away Wei Ying\u2019s outer layers, Wei Ying struggling vertically while Lan Wangji helps him along, his pulse drumming in his ears.</p>\n<p>Then, once they reach his inner robe, Wei Ying swallows and says, \u201cCan I...do you mind if I leave the rest on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not think this is a request borne of modesty. Wei Ying had never demonstrated any shyness about stripping down in Cold Spring during their summer together, much to Lan Wangji\u2019s endless anguish. No, modesty is not a Wei Ying trait. It\u2019s something else, perhaps not meant for him to understand just yet, and Lan Wangji will not question it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cWhatever Wei Ying wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying releases a long sound through his teeth, a noise like <em> hhhhh. </em>\u201cLan Zhan, you can\u2019t just \u2014 you can\u2019t say things like that to me, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Why can\u2019t I? </em>Lan Wangji wonders. Why can\u2019t he offer Wei Ying everything he has?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might take me a while to...\u201d Wei Ying gives a small \u201c<em>hah,</em>\u201d shifts his hips into Lan Wangji\u2019s grip on them. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had assumed as much, given Wei Ying\u2019s puzzling dearth of spiritual energy, given his and the Wens\u2019 slow starvation here. He doesn\u2019t mind being patient or persistent. He would do this all night, into the next.</p>\n<p>So the red inner robe remains on, although the collar splits into a wide vee that dips down to Wei Ying\u2019s bare chest, and Lan Wangji tugs it slightly sideways so that he can suck one of Wei Ying\u2019s dark nipples into his mouth, edged with a hint of teeth.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s hips snap against his as he bucks into the sensation, his hands scrabbling for purchase on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying breathes out, near-reedy, \u201cah, <em> fuck.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji peels the fabric away from Wei Ying\u2019s other pectoral, the Wen brand a stark reminder of their shared trials, and he traces his tongue along the shape of it while Wei Ying shakes and gasps open-mouthed beneath his touch. The skin of the scar is raised, rough against the tip of his tongue. Wei Ying\u2019s fingers are clenched iron-tight in the backs of Lan Wangji\u2019s robes, scraping through the layers against his skin, his knees locked to either of Lan Wangji\u2019s sides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even through the robe, Wei Ying is still so, so thin, his ribs distinct arches through the satin, his belly concave. Maybe that is what he hadn\u2019t wanted Lan Wangji to see. Of course, Wei Ying is beautiful regardless, but the knowledge of it makes Lan Wangji\u2019s chest pulse like a bruise, even as he continues to kiss the skin available to him, gentling his touch as he goes.</p>\n<p>Despite what Wei Ying had said earlier, Lan Wangji can feel that he is already hard against the tight spaces where their bodies touch; it presses hot into the skin above Lan Wangji\u2019s navel, insistent and unmistakable. Wei Ying\u2019s hips keep hitching against his, seeking friction.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji thinks one touch could send him burning up into ash. Each of his nerves is awake, alight in a way he has never known, set humming to life at Wei Ying\u2019s touch; the perils of desire, as his sect had once tried so diligently to warn him. He was not built strong enough to resist its pull, as he once imagined he was. Lan Wangji pulls back to look at Wei Ying, gorgeous and flushed and biting his lips, and thinks, no, he never could have resisted this at all.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze skims down the length of Wei Ying, down the flushed peek of his chest to where his inner robe splits open across his thighs. The damp fabric of his trousers clings to the head of his cock, jutting against the fabric. Wei Ying won\u2019t stop squirming and making small, hurt sounds in his throat. Lan Wangji can hardly catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Wei Ying says, nonsensically, \u201cI want you to \u2014\u201d and Lan Wangji realizes that Wei Ying is begging, in his way, and his patience suddenly snaps like a fine string. His fingers fan out on Wei Ying\u2019s waistband, and Wei Ying jerks, whines in anticipation. Lan Wangji realizes, with a sudden lurch like the ground moving beneath him, that he could make Wei Ying beg more, and Wei Ying would likely do it.</p>\n<p>But tonight is about need, Lan Wangji knows. No spare room for experimentation, for teasing and play. They don\u2019t have the luxury of time. Tonight is about service, a distraction from pain that Lan Wangji can offer Wei Ying, so without any further preamble, he dips his hand inside Wei Ying\u2019s trousers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a punch of sound from Wei Ying then, a weak groan low in his throat. It\u2019s not unlike the sound he makes when hurt, and Lan Wangji snaps a quick, assessing look to Wei Ying\u2019s face and finds himself being watched. There\u2019s no trace of pain he can find, simply a dark-eyed hunger reflected back at him. The shadows hang low in the wickering candlelight, scattered along the hollows of the cave; it casts angular, sharp shadows along the distinct lines of Wei Ying\u2019s face, the whites of his eyes gone. There is a desperation there too, a gleam of wetness, but Lan Wangji is more distracted by the hunger he finds, a black center of gravity that pins him in place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels frenzied with want. He wants to swallow Wei Ying\u2019s cock down until he can no longer breathe, like he had imagined so many times in their early days; wants to open Wei Ying on his fingers until he\u2019s crying with need, then to sink into the heat of him. But they\u2019ve set the boundaries already for tonight, and this is what he is offered. He will drink it down greedily, like sipping nectar from a cupped hand.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been staring for too long, Lan Wangji realizes a moment too late. Wei Ying\u2019s cock twitches under the press of his palm; the moment broken, Wei Ying begins to shift on the bed, maybe self-conscious or uncomfortable. Maybe misreading Lan Wangji\u2019s long pause for hesitancy.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives another experimental stroke, the way he would with himself, and it quickly becomes apparent it\u2019s not \u2014 wet enough, so without a second thought, he pulls his hand out of Wei Ying\u2019s pants, cups it under Wei Ying\u2019s mouth, and says, \u201cSpit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh \u2014 <em> what,</em>\u201d Wei Ying chokes, although the command was straightforward enough that he can\u2019t have misunderstood. His eyes are huge and night-dark, staring at Lan Wangji like he does not know him, and then his tongue darts out to wet his lips and he obediently spits into Lan Wangji\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>A little perfunctory, impatient now, Lan Wangji spits into his hand as well, adding to the mess. It should be disgusting, unclean, but Wei Ying gives a hitched groan and says, in this small voice, \u201cOhmygod \u2014\u00a0<em>Lan Zhan</em>,\u201d so clearly he doesn\u2019t mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me how you like it,\u201d Lan Wangji says, as he slides his hand back into Wei Ying\u2019s waistband. Less patiently, when Wei Ying\u2019s hand flies up to cover his mouth, to muffle his sounds: \u201cDon\u2019t. I want to hear you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying drags his hand away, his breaths panting open-mouthed, and his knuckles spasm, then curl. \u201cAh, after so many times with the Silencing Spell, now Hanguang-jun wants me to \u2014 <em> ah \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>That piece of snark had earned him a rougher twist of Lan Wangji\u2019s fist, a new rhythm, and for a brief span of time, Wei Ying falls uncharacteristically quiet, other than a litany of small gasps and moans, other than to occasionally whisper something like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s \u2014 <em> yeah</em>, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>The angle is becoming trickier, the more that Wei Ying fills out \u2014 his trousers are threadbare and loose, but the fabric still confines the movements of Lan Wangji\u2019s hand a considerable degree. But he doesn\u2019t want to push anything, to invade Wei Ying\u2019s boundaries, when he had asked him to \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes the decision for him, reaching down to hook his thumbs in his waistband, to wriggle them down just enough so that his cock is bared to the twilight cool, the fabric bunching below his balls. Most of his upper layers are still sashed on, just that vee of skin brooked open to Lan Wangji\u2019s view, and now \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slows his hand, letting himself look even as Wei Ying squirms, his cock hardening further under Lan Wangji\u2019s scrutiny. Wei Ying is \u2014 wet, pearled wetter than Lan Wangji usually gets at the head, the spit from earlier adding to the mess. Clear trails of it run over the grooves of Lan Wangji\u2019s knuckles, and Lan Wangji is surprised by how much he loves it. He hadn\u2019t been certain, when he\u2019d pored through the collection Wei Ying had given him so long ago, that this part of sex could be erotic, but Lan Wangji likes the mess of it, the raw honesty of it, the truth of desire that Wei Ying\u2019s body can\u2019t deflect or hide away.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is close; Lan Wangji can tell by his staccato breathing, the splotchy flush creeping up his collarbones and his neck, the way his head arches back into the bed. Lan Wangji slows his hand again, and Wei Ying makes a feral sound of protest, and perhaps it is a little cruel to draw it out, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s just that Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t want it to be over, not yet, because when it\u2019s over, it will mean that they...</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, <em> please,</em>\u201d Wei Ying begs, tilting his hips up into Lan Wangji\u2019s grip. \u201cI need \u2014 I need to \u2014\u201d There are tears collecting in the corners of his eyes \u2014 Wei Ying had said it was too far, if he cried, he had not wanted to, so Lan Wangji obeys, gives Wei Ying what he wants: a firm hand and a steady rhythm, and Wei Ying comes like that, shaking, a guttural groan clenched between his teeth.</p>\n<p>For some reason, despite everything they\u2019ve done up until now, it\u2019s at this moment that the reality of the situation settles into Lan Wangji; the hot, dripping mess between them, the physical evidence of it soaking Lan Wangji\u2019s hand and both of their clothes, Wei Ying\u2019s gradually slowing gasps. He blinks up at Wei Ying, who blinks back down at him, equally dazed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh. So, this was sex. More or less. They had really...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sags back onto the hard bed, closing his eyes, and Lan Wangji takes that moment to politely tuck Wei Ying\u2019s softening cock back into his damp trousers, more than a little sad to see it go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wei Ying tries to say a moment later, out of breath, and then nothing for another handful of moments \u2014 for so long that Lan Wangji thinks he may have fallen asleep, and then Wei Ying continues, hoarse and a little accusing, \u201cYou\u2019ve practiced that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a noncommittal noise, which causes Wei Ying\u2019s eyes to crack open, to appraise him with hazy curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe texts you gave me were...informative,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his ears warming. There\u2019s no point in being evasive about it now, not after this.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth parts in shock, and he stares at Lan Wangji in disbelief for a moment before he rolls his head back and laughs, a running brook of light, high giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really,\u201d Wei Ying marvels, gasping through his laughter. \u201cYou really kept that cut-sleeve porn? And <em> studied it </em>like \u2014 what, like your Lan precepts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d says Lan Wangji, unabashed. He\u2019s willing to say anything to keep Wei Ying laughing like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi, isn\u2019t that too shameless?\u201d Wei Ying teases. His eyes are brighter than Lan Wangji can remember in a long time, a sliver of his old self \u2014 uncomplicatedly happy, his defenses and protective barbs forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no shame in this,\u201d Lan Wangji says evenly, and is surprised to find how much he believes it.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes his head as his laughter slows, piecing off into warm, intermittent chuckles. \u201cLan Zhan ah, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cI adore you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji freezes; Wei Ying freezes in turn. Then Wei Ying winces and laughs again, more stilted and off-center than before, and keeps talking in a stuttered rush while Lan Wangji\u2019s heart bangs like a door battered by storm, a loud and arrhythmic pounding.</p>\n<p>Adore, adore, adore. Maybe he hadn\u2019t meant it, maybe it had been the floating comedown from orgasm, but adore, Wei Ying had said, so fond, <em> Lan Zhan, I adore you \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI really thought you destroyed those,\u201d Wei Ying is rambling. \u201cYou were so mad that I thought you were going to hunt me down and kill me, and meanwhile, all this time...\u201d He pauses thoughtfully, then mutters, with soft vindication and narrowed eyes, \u201cI <em> knew </em>you weren\u2019t just some little prude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was,\u201d Lan Wangji corrects him, pulled from the circular spiral of his thoughts. \u201cUntil Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a pleased sound that sounds suspiciously like \u201ceheheh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Wei Ying says, affecting a scholarly nod, a wide smile still dimpling his cheeks. \u201cTop marks from this shifu, Lan er-gongzi. The student has outclassed the master.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat mastery?\u201d Lan Wangji wonders. \u201cYou did not last long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gasps like he\u2019s taken a genuine hit, then kicks Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder with his bare foot. \u201cLan Zhan! That\u2019s so fucking mean!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, dodging the foot.</p>\n<p>In a sudden, surprising display of energy, Wei Ying levers himself up, still only half-dressed, and launches himself at Lan Wangji, wrangling him with a grip of his bony knees so their positions are flipped. Lan Wangji could put up more of a fight \u2014 he has an impressively low center of gravity \u2014 but he allows it, feeling the threat of a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hovers over him, his messy tangle of hair dangling around his face, and just \u2014 stares at Lan Wangji for a moment, and then his thumb comes up to rest on the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d he says then, with quiet wonder.</p>\n<p>He is, Lan Wangji realizes, so he stops, though the warm, buttery feeling that knocks around in his chest remains.</p>\n<p>\u201cNooo,\u201d Wei Ying protests with genuine dismay. Both of his thumbs pull at the edges of Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth, as if he\u2019s trying to coax it back into shape. \u201cLan Zhan, do it again, I barely got to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo something to make me,\u201d Lan Wangji suggests, and Wei Ying pauses, hitches his breath, raises his eyebrows. A subterranean ripple between them, a tectonic shift, and just like that, the mood darkens again, ripening like a blackberry, rich and sweet. Like a mouthful of chocolate, or the reddest wine.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying lowers himself, so slowly, and kisses Lan Wangji this way, purposeful and heady. Easy, Lan Wangji\u2019s lower lip caught between both of Wei Ying\u2019s. Wei Ying pulls back an increment, still so close that their eyelashes tangle; still so close that Wei Ying fills his field of vision, central and entire. Lan Wangji allows the separation for a moment more, allows for the tender tension of two people sharing warm breath between them, before his impatience wins out and he chases after the kiss, capturing Wei Ying\u2019s lips with renewed force. Wei Ying hums a warm, amused sound against his mouth, the shape curving up into a smile, and it\u2019s enough for Lan Wangji to know he\u2019d done exactly what Wei Ying wanted from him, a tease then a playful pursuit.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is bracketed between his thighs, his hips grinding down in slow, rolling movements against Lan Wangji\u2019s; each one sends sparks scattering through him. Before their conversation had distracted him, Lan Wangji had been hard to the point of pain, and kissing Wei Ying again, the floodplain of arousal returns in a white rush. He had teased Wei Ying for his lack of stamina, but he knows his own will be pathetic by comparison, however Wei Ying will have him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying must sense Lan Wangji\u2019s growing discomfort, the desperation that he\u2019s failing to stifle, because he pulls away from the kiss and starts to peel open layer after layer of Lan Wangji\u2019s clothes, complaining under his breath about the Lan dress code the entire way. He keeps going until Lan Wangji\u2019s skin is finally bared to his observation. Wei Ying licks his lips, runs a hand down the planes of his chest, of his abdominal muscles while Lan Wangji trembles under the touch. His robes are still half-on, hanging off his shoulders and elbows in various states of disarray, and it somehow feels more wanton than if he were fully naked.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying murmurs a low curse, then rubs one of his thumbs over one of Lan Wangji\u2019s nipples. The jolt of feeling from it is startling, and Lan Wangji jerks involuntarily with a gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, look at you,\u201d Wei Ying says lowly with a disbelieving shake of his head, and that same core of heat from earlier tightens behind Lan Wangji\u2019s navel, spreads rapidly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one else gets to have this?\u201d Wei Ying continues, a quiet mutter \u2014 a little doubtful, a little awed. Mostly self-directed, Lan Wangji thinks.</p>\n<p>He responds anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it like you mean it,\u201d Lan Wangji says. Low and with heat.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes snap up to his, his cheeks dark. Then there\u2019s a flash of his teeth as he smiles, the sharp jut of a canine. Lan Wangji might be imagining the flare of red in his pupils.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one else gets to have this,\u201d Wei Ying says, throaty and emphatic, and all of Lan Wangji\u2019s breath shakes out of him. Ah, so this is what it\u2019s like to feel \u2014 claimed. He is leaking through his trousers.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying licks his lips with intention as he drops lower, his gaze hungry and eager on the shape of Lan Wangji\u2019s dick through the fabric. He settles almost languidly between Lan Wangji\u2019s legs, his purpose clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to suck you off again,\u201d Wei Ying says anyway, then darts a look up to Lan Wangji, a little sheepish. \u201cAh...properly, this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d Lan Wangji says, a little apprehensive from their last conversation, and Wei Ying\u2019s mouth curves up into a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really, really want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>A thrill of nerves jangles in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach, rattling like a box of nails as Wei Ying rolls down his trousers, already soaked through. He\u2019s never had his pleasure so at the mercy of another. It feels like relinquishing control, submitting to vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a low noise in his throat. Lan Wangji\u2019s cock is flushed dark against the pale cradle of his hips. There\u2019s already a mess of precome over his belly and thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, pretty, just like the rest of you,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, and Lan Wangji feels himself flush helplessly from his chest to his ears, a dark-red heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be big,\u201d Wei Ying adds, sounding deeply satisfied and matter-of-fact about it, and before Lan Wangji can even begin to question the implications of <em> that, </em>Wei Ying leans forward and laps at the head of his cock.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lasts no time at all, and it\u2019s humiliating. It\u2019s only been a handful of seconds of the most experimental touches of Wei Ying\u2019s lips and tongue before he finishes, and it goes like this: Wei Ying flattens his tongue along the underside of Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. He keeps his mouth wide open as he looks up at Lan Wangji from under his lashes and winks, and the coyness of it, the shamelessness of it is such an echo of their earliest days, of library teasing and rooftop sparring, that Lan Wangji comes with a soft, punched sound, his teeth digging into his knuckles. The first string of it hits Wei Ying\u2019s cheek, and Wei Ying flinches in surprise before he hurries to catch the rest in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s hand comes down to Wei Ying\u2019s cheek, cupping around the jutting shape of himself as he rasps, \u201cQuick, spit it out,\u201d but Wei Ying patiently pushes his hand away, his eyes still closed as he continues to swallow eagerly, noisily. The feeling of his throat working around him wrenches another wave of pleasure out of Lan Wangji, and his knees go spongy, his eyes rolling back and his head falling back against the bed.</p>\n<p>His thoughts go white and noiseless for several moments, and an embarrassing span of time passes before he returns to his body fully and realizes Wei Ying is staring at him, maybe fond and maybe expectant.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers. He\u2019s still trembling. His thumb sweeps along Wei Ying\u2019s cheek to wipe away the mess, but Wei Ying just hums and grabs Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist, sucking his dirtied thumb into his mouth and hollowing his cheeks. Something seismic ripples through Lan Wangji as he stares at Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he manages.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan tasted too good to waste,\u201d Wei Ying explains, then flashes a winning smile. Lan Wangji keeps staring, completely speechless.</p>\n<p>He closes his eyes, then at last goes limp against the bed. There\u2019s still a hum under his skin, a low-simmering haze.</p>\n<p>His eyes fly open in shock when he feels the wet heat of Wei Ying\u2019s mouth close around him again, and he jerks himself up onto his elbows.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you \u2014\u201d he begins, a little wildly.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks up at him, his cheeks hollowed out, before he pulls off with a wet sound and explains, with immense patience, \u201cYou\u2019re still hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not need to \u2014\u201d Lan Wangji tries again, blushing so hard he can barely speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Wei Ying says, plainly honest.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Wei Ying adds, then slides his gaze away, down to Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh. Pink glows in his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s like. It\u2019s like, uh, when I was doing...that, all of the noise in my head went away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows, the revelation of this settling over him. Tonight is about providing Wei Ying care, distraction, a loving touch, he reminds himself. Perhaps he had...miscalculated what that looks like, for Wei Ying. This, too, is something he can provide.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen continue,\u201d Lan Wangji says. Soft, but the command non-negotiable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s gaze widens at him, then blackens, his mouth falling slightly open. Then Lan Wangji watches as something slides away behind his eyes; like sharper edges are retracting, smoothing over into a faraway focus that\u2019s more relaxed, more settled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying starts again, Lan Wangji, mercifully, has a greater degree of control over himself; it feels as good as before, but he can focus now that the painful edge is off. Lan Wangji slides his hand into Wei Ying\u2019s hair, guiding him where it feels best with gentle but firm one-word directions. It\u2019s a near-comical illusion of assuredness, given Lan Wangji\u2019s complete lack of experience. This is...a role he\u2019s filling, like he\u2019s play-acting, but it\u2019s one he slips into naturally \u2014\u00a0 so naturally that he has to take a moment to acknowledge that there may be several things he does not yet know about himself. About Wei Ying, either. This configuration of them is entirely new, an uncharted terrain, each step blind and exploratory.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlower, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji instructs, and Wei Ying obeys, bobbing his head more carefully. Ah, so he likes a firm hand. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives a tiny, stifled moan around his cock. The thrum of it zips up Lan Wangji\u2019s spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is interesting. And informative. It is certainly something Lan Wangji is happy to provide, now that he knows he is permitted to.</p>\n<p>He waits a little before he does it again, so that Wei Ying can\u2019t come to expect it; he waits until a particularly deep slide that makes his toes tingle, then, a little experimental, he murmurs, \u201cGood, Wei Ying,\u201d and Wei Ying makes that sound again, low and whimpering and desperate.</p>\n<p>He really is so good, Lan Wangji thinks with a desolate pang of adoration. Wei Ying can\u2019t take Lan Wangji\u2019s cock completely, but he tries his hardest, working his mouth in an eager, messy rhythm. The sounds of it should be mortifying, slick and lewd and echoing too loudly around the cave, but all of this, every part of it, feels incendiary. Wei Ying stops only to occasionally choke, or to catch his breath. The second time this happens, tears leak out of the corners of Wei Ying\u2019s eyes, and Lan Wangji reaches down to thumb them away as he tells him, again, \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan,</em>\u201d Wei Ying whines, evidently having caught on to Lan Wangji\u2019s game. He pulls off and strokes Lan Wangji\u2019s dick in his hand, a wet slide up and down while he talks. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that on purpose.\u201d His chin is shiny with spit and precome, his lips swollen dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji replies.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares at him, his pupils blown with either shock or heat. Maybe a bit of both.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lowers his voice. \u201cYou like it. When I tell you how good you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows, his eyes still huge. Maybe he hadn\u2019t expected Lan Wangji to say it so directly, or he hadn\u2019t expected to be so thoroughly seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, a little trance-like, he gives a small, slow nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen keep going,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps. \u201cTake what you need from me, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what about what Lan Zhan needs?\u201d Wei Ying asks, his brows cresting together into a small frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s this,\u201d Lan Wangji assures him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shudders out a small sound, then drops his forehead to rest against Lan Wangji\u2019s upper thigh. He takes a hidden moment there\u00a0 to compose himself while Lan Wangji waits patiently, runs fingers through strands of his soft hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re too much,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles into his skin, then pops his head back up. \u201cAlright, attempting the impossible again.\u201d And he resumes his earlier task, swallowing Lan Wangji down easier than before, and the renewed sensation makes Lan Wangji choke on a fast breath, his back arching up against the hard bed. Wei Ying watches him up the length of Lan Wangji\u2019s body as he continues, and Lan Wangji\u2019s breath stutters to a halt in his chest when their eyes meet.</p>\n<p>This is really Wei Ying, the love of his life. They\u2019re really here and doing this. Even if they\u2019re doing this for different reasons; even if they\u2019re...taking different things from this shared experience. The reality of it scatters over Lan Wangji like a shower of sparks, and he starts to fuck Wei Ying\u2019s mouth in earnest as pleasure concentrates to a single point, tingles along his skin. Wei Ying lets him \u2014 relaxes his mouth and his neck and lets Lan Wangji take from him before he suddenly drags in Lan Wangji closer, down to the root with a choked sound, and gives a vicious swallow, and Lan Wangji\u2019s second orgasm hits like a crack of lightning. He\u2019s loud through it, louder than he thought he could be.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying drinks him down as dutifully as before, a dreamy smile curling at the edges of his lips.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji collapses back against the bed, his chest heaving. He can feel sweat pooled in the dip of his navel, along the grooves of his chest, collecting damp under his hairline. His thoughts have never been so quiet, so far away.</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying is climbing up so that he\u2019s straddling Lan Wangji\u2019s hips, his hands planted to the slick expanse of his abdomen.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying breathes. His mouth and chin are still wet, his gaze glassed and dark from whatever new state he\u2019s underwater to. He gives a slight roll of his hips, perhaps involuntary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, strangely vulnerable, like a wolf flashing its underbelly, Wei Ying whispers, \u201cWas it...good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pushes himself up onto an elbow, using his free hand to grind the heel of his palm against Wei Ying\u2019s lap. Wei Ying cries out, a spasm rolling through him as he bows his head and pushes his hips into Lan Wangji\u2019s hand, his mouth fallen open.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Lan Wangji says, with total, breathless honesty. \u201cWei Ying is perfect,\u201d and Wei Ying gasps and gasps and shakes apart over him, his fingers clenching into Lan Wangji\u2019s skin hard enough to mark, rocking up into Lan Wangji\u2019s palm until there\u2019s a new spread of wet, an ellipse of heat between them as they sink down into each other, down and down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterward \u2014 as they lay side by side and catch their breath, field their thoughts \u2014 Wei Ying murmurs, tracing an unknown pattern on his shoulder, \u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, halfway to asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn Phoenix Mountain.\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s voice is smooth and without inflection, empty of any anger or blame, but Lan Wangji tenses regardless, at once wide awake.</p>\n<p>Lying is forbidden, he reminds himself. His throat works as he tries to respond, but he gets no sense that Wei Ying is waiting for an answer or an explanation \u2014 he had spoken with a quiet, assured conviction. As though it\u2019s a courtesy to Lan Wangji, to let him know what he already knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The sudden acidity of his shame is an uncomfortable clench in his stomach. \u201cIt was...wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says softly. The traced patterns on his shoulder have not stopped, but Lan Wangji cannot relax.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. He feels \u2014 sheepish, to be caught doing something so unprincipled, so indecent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought...maybe, after it happened,\u201d Wei Ying answers. \u201cThere was a \u2014 ah, I don\u2019t know, your scent. Your presence, something that felt familiar. I wrote it off as wishful thinking, of course. And then, tonight...that, aha, thing you do with your tongue. It was the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji realizes he\u2019s holding his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut mostly,\u201d Wei Ying continues, softer, more reflective, \u201cit\u2019s that. No one touches me like you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets his breath go, closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad it was you,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, and drops a kiss on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time they wake up, Wei Ying has reassembled his armor, the precarious openness of the night before tucked away into some hidden nook. He keeps his expressions still and cool, never looking at Lan Wangji for too long as he leads him out of the Demon-Slaughtering Cave.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing awaits them as Wei Ying briefly excuses himself to retrieve something from the cave, leaving the two of them in a somewhat awkward silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for your hospitality, Wen-guniang,\u201d Lan Wangji says with a polite bow, for lack of something better to say.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing\u2019s gaze drops to Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, where the love-bite Wei Ying had sucked into his skin last night is no doubt as visible as a brand, and the corner of her mouth twitches, not quite a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWen-daifu,\u201d she corrects, not unkindly. \u201cThank you for your visit, Hanguang-jun.\u201d She hesitates, then says, \u201cIt has been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Wei Wuxian in such high spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji remains silent, a small ache taking root in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish there was something more I could do to help,\u201d he says after a moment, with all the sincerity he can muster.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing raises her eyebrows. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d Wen Qing says, just as Wei Ying rejoins them. \u201cI will send a list of the medical supplies that we most need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would be glad to oblige,\u201d Lan Wangji says earnestly, just as Wei Ying complains, \u201cAiyo, Wen Qing, I leave for two minutes and you\u2019re already trying to steal Lan Zhan\u2019s money?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun offered,\u201d Wen Qing says, primly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lan Wangji submits.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying narrows his eyes between the two of them. \u201cHmm. I don\u2019t trust this new partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Qing rolls her eyes at him, and then courteously bows to Lan Wangji. \u201cSafe travels, Hanguang-jun. We hope to see you here again sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRich-gege!\u201d The cry is distant at first, then quickly comes closer, A-Yuan\u2019s voice bouncing with his stumbling steps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next thing Lan Wangji knows, there\u2019s a solid weight around his thigh, and he\u2019s blinking down into A-Yuan\u2019s sleepy, cherubic face.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying scolds, belied by the fond curl of his lips, the soft warmth in his eyes. \u201cHow is Rich-gege supposed to walk like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna come,\u201d A-Yuan says stubbornly, and Wei Ying sighs and looks to Lan Wangji with something like an apology, and Lan Wangji murmurs, \u201cLet him, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d and Wei Ying gazes at him now with a complicated expression, appraising and rapidly softening.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Wei Ying allows, then huffs <em> ai-yaa </em>as he bends down to prise A-Yuan off of Lan Wangji\u2019s leg. A-Yuan\u2019s tiny hands dig into the lacy folds, clinging stubbornly against Wei Ying\u2019s hold as he\u2019s peeled away. \u201cA-Yuan, you\u2019re getting too big for this. Xian-gege is an old man whose back hurts now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They set off down the trail, away from the camp, with A-Yuan gripping onto both of their hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says conversationally. \u201cYou can say no sometimes. No need to be so good and upstanding all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows he\u2019s referring to his offer to Wen Qing. It must be troubling him more than Lan Wangji had initially thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cI offered,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes from earlier. \u201cAnd I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gazes at him sideways, expressionless. \u201cI already owe you so much money. I was supposed to treat yesterday, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying owes me nothing,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and hopes he will not have to say it again. Wei Ying sighs.</p>\n<p>They continue on in silence until they\u2019re some ways down the path, the tangle of spiny gray trees growing thicker around them. In the quiet, the imminence of their farewell settles palpably between them.</p>\n<p>Somehow, they reach an unspoken agreement on where to stop, because they both pause in their steps at the same time, turning to regard each other. Sense-memory of the previous evening floods back to Lan Wangji, looking at Wei Ying directly, and warmth balloons in his chest.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying also looks a little pink before he visibly takes a breath, then looks away, his expression shuttering. \u201cWell. Hanguang-jun has a long journey ahead of him. I won\u2019t keep you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, almost dismissively. A-Yuan pulls at his hand, over and over. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> But I do, </em> Lan Wangji thinks. <em> I always do. </em></p>\n<p>For the fifth time this morning, he entertains the idea of just \u2014 staying. Helping the Wens build a life here, buying things for A-Yuan, sleeping each night with Wei Ying in his arms. The impossibility of it is almost absurd, of imagining himself living in such a place, but still. He aches.</p>\n<p>There are several things Lan Wangji could say, looking at Wei Ying across from him. He wants to beg Wei Ying, one last time, to stop using resentment, to see more clearly the ways it\u2019s whittling him down day by day. He wants to plead with him, ridiculously and against all possibility, to come home with him. He wants to kiss him, again and again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will go,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly, and turns to leave. He feels Wei Ying watch him the entire way.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is Rich-gege going?\u201d he hears A-Yuan\u2019s tiny voice, floating through the trees. \u201cWill he come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t hear Wei Ying\u2019s reply. A tremor shakes in his chest, all the way back to Gusu.</p>\n<p>When he returns, Lan Wangji is made to kneel in punishment for hours. Shufu berates him for an entire shichen, reminding him of his father\u2019s marriage, of the curse of the black thread. Lan Wangji listens, but spends the lecture thinking about Wei Ying\u2019s tongue in his mouth, the subtle taste of him that still remains in the oddest of places. Behind his teeth, when he licks his lips.</p>\n<p>The punishment goes beyond kneeling: Lan Wangji is ordered not to leave Gusu until he is permitted to, with the exception of cultivation conferences. It\u2019s an especially draconian sentence, given Lan Wangji\u2019s position within his sect \u2014 never before has his mobility been so forcibly restricted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows that, embedded under the explosive anger, his shufu is terrified for him. He had watched it glitter wildly in his eyes during the lecture, and despite their differences on this stance, Lan Wangji does understand his reasons.</p>\n<p>So, that year, Lan Wangji does what he\u2019s told. He stays in Gusu, and dreams of Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>As the months creep along, Lan Wangji sends what he can to Wei Ying: letters, robes for him and the other Wens, medical supplies, food and liquor and even two chickens. He has no doubt that Wei Ying and the Wens will see these gifts as a lacking attempt at courting, and they wouldn\u2019t exactly...be wrong. Lan Wangji isn\u2019t <em> not </em>courting Wei Ying, though he would send the gifts regardless of whether he was or was not. For courting, it\u2019s a shameful display, given Lan Wangji\u2019s status and his means, given what Wei Ying deserves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he was allowed, if circumstances were different, Lan Wangji could travel to Lotus Pier to court Wei Ying in full. He would be accompanied by his uncle and brother, to present Wei Ying and his remaining family with the most lavish of gifts. It would be a public affair; the entire cultivation world would know they belonged to each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But as it is, Lan Wangji sends what he can when he can slip away from surveillance, when he can make day trips to Caiyi.</p>\n<p>He hears from Wei Ying once in their year apart, nearly halfway through it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an especially frigid winter morning when he does. Heavy snows had blown in over the mountains the night before, and an unbroken blanket of white swallows the Cloud Recesses, the deposits of snow whipped into rigid, crystalline shapes by the strong winds. Lan Wangji is in the middle of attempting to warm his hands \u2014 the cold had left his fingers too stiff for his morning guqin practice \u2014 when the package arrives to the jingshi.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Hanguang-jun,\u201d the younger disciple says, taking care to remain outside the doorway, before he leaves.</p>\n<p>The package is crudely wrapped, the scrawl on the front a familiar scribble of <em> Lan Zhan. </em>Lan Wangji\u2019s pulse picks up into a frenzy; he has reviewed that irredeemable handwriting too many times to not recognize it.</p>\n<p>He finds two gifts when he opens the package.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first is a red hair-ribbon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s heart pounds, pounds, pounds as he runs the silk through his fingers. He can imagine Wei Ying\u2019s teasing laughter, demanding faux-seriously that Lan Wangji wear it in his hair, if only to give the elders a near-death scare.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheeky,\u201d he murmurs to himself. He feels like he could burst from fondness.</p>\n<p>He sets the ribbon aside and reaches to unwrap the other gift. When he does, he feels his breath stutter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a white jade comb. Its material and craftsmanship are not of the same caliber as those that he and xiongzhang use, but it is still beautifully made, and something that Lan Wangji cannot understand how Wei Ying afforded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Engraved along the spine of the comb is a finely detailed cloud, much like the filigree on his forehead ribbon.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels, suddenly, sick with love; a painful twist in his stomach, his pulse too fast and his palms sweaty. He misses Wei Ying always, but in this moment with a feral fervor.</p>\n<p>Lastly, he finds a note tucked away at the bottom, inked messily onto cheap paper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Let me begin by apologizing for my silence these months. We have been keeping very busy through the winter! But please know every single gift has been appreciated by everyone here. Wen Qing wanted me to thank you especially for the medicinal herbs; it is very hard to grow such things in a terrain like this, and we cannot afford most of what we need. A-Yuan adores the chickens. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Let me explain the gifts. I know your birthday is this month, and wanted to ensure they did not arrive late, so hopefully they have come early! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The hair-ribbon is a selfish gift, I admit. But when have I not been self-indulgent? So what if I want Lan Zhan to think of me in our time apart? I wish I could have seen your face as you opened it. I can hear you say \u201cridiculous\u201d in my head so clearly. Ahaha, Lan Zhan, I miss you.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019ll have to forgive the lacking quality of the comb, as I know it\u2019s nowhere near fit for a Jade of Gusu. But I thought of you when I saw it in Yiling, and knew I had to get it for you, so I sold one of my inventions for a handsome price. (Just a small one, nothing too earth-shaking, so don\u2019t look at me like that.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lan Zhan, thank you again for the gifts, for your letters. For even caring at all. It is very lonely here, even with the Wens, and whenever I get something from you, my entire month is brighter. I don\u2019t know what I did in a past life to deserve a red thread with you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hopefully it won\u2019t be so long before we see each other again, and know that I am thinking of you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wei Ying </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji reads the letter four times, each time more carefully than the last, before he crosses over to his bed and lays down on top of the covers to stare at the ceiling in abject despair, suddenly useless to do anything else. The warmth in his face, a small sun that pulses in his chest, will not recede, no matter how sternly he tries to reassert control over his body. What would his younger self say, to see himself reduced to such silliness? From the effects of Wei Wuxian, no less? Lan Wangji did not read much fiction as a child, but he had always scoffed whenever he encountered romance in texts, the ridiculous and exaggerated fictions of the bodily reactions. The overwrought prose was so frivolous, he\u2019d thought then, so far-fetched.</p>\n<p>He could fill scrolls and scrolls with this feeling, pages upon pages. He thinks if he unspooled it to its full length, it might reach the moon.</p>\n<p><em> Ridiculous, </em> Lan Wangji tells himself, a little desperately, <em> so ridiculous, </em>and it is. It is ridiculous, to be rendered so brainless by sentiment, by a single letter from Wei Ying after months of silence, but perhaps it is fate, after all, to feel this way.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji moves through his morning rituals diligently, but his thoughts couldn\u2019t be further from his tasks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mostly, he unpicks the gnarled knots of their situation, snagging on the same setbacks again and again. There is no middle ground for them to meet; Wei Ying certainly cannot come here, and he would never abandon the Wens. Nor would Lan Wangji ask him to, or want him to. Lan Wangji cannot go to the Burial Mounds, not with his responsibilities to his sect, not with the increasingly fraught politics of the cultivation sects starting to shake under their feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A dark, feral instinct sometimes itches in Lan Wangji \u2014\u00a0whispers to him that he could take Wei Ying to the Cloud Recesses anyway, keep him here where no one could hurt him, where he would always be within reach, but he recognizes the temptation as his father\u2019s curse. He hears the warning in his shufu\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>To keep Wei Ying here like a penned animal, to watch his spirit dwindle until his mother\u2019s emptiness settles inside him \u2014 the mere imagining makes Lan Wangji sick. Wei Ying would be safe, but miserable, and Lan Wangji would die first before seeing Wei Ying miserable, or changed.</p>\n<p>Still, he has faith. The red thread was given to them for a reason, and fate does not lie \u2014 they are destined to be at each other\u2019s side, Lan Wangji constantly reminds himself. He takes assurance in the objective, externally-determined proof of this fact. Perhaps this period is important as a personal trial, a ritual of fire to change him so that he is suitable to belong to Wei Ying; he is already a markedly different person than when they first met, after all. Perhaps the road to find each other is convoluted, rocky and strange, but Lan Wangji clings onto conviction: that he and Wei Ying will be together at the end, having weathered all.<br><br></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The letter is the last Lan Wangji hears from Wei Ying before Jin Rulan\u2019s one-month celebration. Before the bloodbath at Qiongqi Path, the rapid acceleration of events thereafter. How quickly everything crumbles, how quickly the ground beneath them gives way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he first hears of Jin Zixuan\u2019s death, of Wei Ying\u2019s implication in it, Lan Wangji flies to Jinlintai, his unofficial confinement to the Cloud Recesses be damned. He finds the place curiously empty as he strides from hall to hall, the polished gold and blue interiors draped in solemn, funereal-white banners.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are too late,\u201d one of the Jin cultivators finally tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels prophetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur soldiers, the rest of the sects,\u201d the cultivator says. \u201cThey have already gone to Nightless City.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the years after, it will be a long time before Lan Wangji can fully recall the events of Nightless City. Usually his memory is unfailing, unerring, but for several reasons, his recollections of this night are as evasive as shadows, slippery in his grasp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers the rooftop, pleading with Wei Ying, bargaining with the cold and alien emptiness of his eyes, the resentment that spills out from his skin.</p>\n<p>He remembers the death of Jiang Yanli, the flowers of blood spreading fast on her mourning robe, how Wei Ying\u2019s screams shatter out from him and ring and ring and ring in his ears. He mostly remembers when the Stygian Tiger Seal breaks, but after that, only a haze of blood and viscera, as he fights and fights to reach Wei Ying, until his energy nearly fails him, until his legs nearly give out.</p>\n<p>In that pandemonium, he eventually finds Wei Ying crumpled against a broken column, guarded by a protective ring of fierce corpses. Lan Wangji slashes his way through, cuts down each one like stalks of corn until he reaches Wei Ying, until he finally puts his shaking, bloodied hands on his face, so cold and milk-pale, his lips nearly blue. Touching him for the first time since that night, over a year ago, in the Burial Mounds, a different lifetime. A check to Wei Ying\u2019s wrist reveals that his spiritual energy is gone. The red thread pulses weakly between them, a heart trying to beat.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bundles him up with his left arm onto Bichen. His right one is useless, having been slashed to ribbons.</p>\n<p>Through the din of battle, Lan Wangji hears his xiongzhang scream out his name, but he does not look back. He pulls Wei Ying\u2019s limp body onto Bichen, and he takes him from Nightless City.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t make it to the Burial Mounds. They\u2019re both too weak to finish the trip on sword \u2014 Wei Ying from qi depletion, Lan Wangji from carrying them through the night and his own blood loss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When his sword finally falters, somewhere over Yiling, and nearly sends them tumbling from the sky, Lan Wangji lands them and drags Wei Ying\u2019s unconscious body until he finds a small cave.</p>\n<p>For two days, without food or water, that\u2019s where they stay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the time, Wei Ying stares off into something unseen, his eyes faraway, witnessing horrors invisible to Lan Wangji. Black coils of resentment wreath around his hands, his chest. Tears streak silently down his cheeks, clearing thin tracks through the blood and grime. In the rare moments of lucidity, Wei Ying looks at Lan Wangji as though he does not recognize him, as though he is someone strange and unwelcome. Sometimes, a whip-crack of anger breaks through the numbness; he shoves at Lan Wangji, a maelstrom of fury and terror, as though Lan Wangji\u2019s gentle touch scalds his skin.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji grips onto Wei Ying\u2019s hands regardless, and continues to pass him spiritual energy until he loses any track of time. He can feel the slow drain of the energy\u2019s depletion under his skin, a heavy and creeping exhaustion, but his efforts seem to have no effect on Wei Ying. Like a wall that cannot be breached.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji murmurs to him all the while; dabs at the blood dribbling from his lips, the tears that won\u2019t stop falling, the worst of the grime with his blood-crusted sleeves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire time, Wei Ying weeps, expressionless and silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, I love you,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, once, in the darkest hour of one of their two shared nights. \u201cWei Ying. I fell in love with you before we even met. If we survive this, I will love you for the rest of our days. Wei Ying, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying looks at him with a deep-sea emptiness. His gaze a dark and unfamiliar void.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet lost,\u201d he says, hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His family and the elders find them after two days. They find him while he\u2019s passing energy to Wei Ying, in the middle of murmuring senseless consolations, his fingers encircled around Wei Ying\u2019s wrists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji!\u201d he hears his shufu\u2019s horrified shout. \u201cGet away from him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRestrain him,\u201d one of the elders tells the others. He is talking about Wei Ying. \u201cTake him to Nightless City. Make sure he is unharmed; they want him alive. He will answer for his crimes there. Hanguang-jun will return to the Cloud Recesses at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three of the elders move toward him to reach for Wei Ying, who still stares off into nothing, resentment pulsing out of him in thick, hateful waves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bloodies all three of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji!\u201d his xiongzhang screams, his eyes wide with terror and gleaming white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wangji,</em>\u201d his shufu shouts, all the blood in his face having drained.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun, the Yiling Laozu has infected you with evil,\u201d one of the elders tries to reason with him. He too is pale, his lips tight. \u201cPlease consider what you are doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of you will touch him,\u201d Lan Wangji grits out, keeping Bichen extended. Blood drips from the blade. Something wild bucks in him, a cornered and heaving beast. Amidst it all, he can feel the weight of his brother\u2019s fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji,\u201d one of the other elders says, a rising threat rumbling in his voice. \u201cDo not force our hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not want to harm you,\u201d another elder pleads. \u201cGive over Wei Wuxian, and come back to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he goes, I go with him,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. His hands are shaking uncontrollably; his energy is entirely gone. His sleeve is still matted with dried blood, the fabric growing wet again as his wound from the battle reopens.</p>\n<p>A ripple of shocked dismay passes through the elders like a wind over a grass-field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen whispers. Tears glitter in his eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d shufu says in a choked voice. He is clutching his chest, as though he\u2019s struggling to breathe. \u201cRemember all I have taught you. This is not the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian has poisoned the mind of Hanguang-jun,\u201d one of the elders cries. \u201cHow truly evil he must be!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not make us fight you, Lan Wangji!\u201d another elder yells. \u201cWe will spare you no mercy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is not counting on mercy. If Wei Ying is going to die here, then he plans to as well. The red thread is nearly invisible in the midnight black of the cave, with Wei Ying\u2019s energy fading and fading. But he still can still feel it, a tether to each other, unbroken and defiant.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he goes,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, enunciating so every word rings out and can be heard. \u201cI go with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, the bloodshed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The disciple who whips him is named Lan Sizheng. When the boy was younger, Lan Wangji had mentored him for some time; had taught him how to correctly hold a bow and arrow, had corrected his footwork on the more advanced Lan sword forms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is told that Lan Sizheng volunteered.</p>\n<p>They first strip Lan Wangji of his layers, leaving his top bare to a frost-chilled autumn morning. Then his headpieces, so his hair spills loose over his shoulders. They have him kneel in front of the yashi, as he had alongside Wei Ying so many years ago.</p>\n<p>Lan Sizheng whips him, and the rest of his sect watches on, silent. Really, it should be one of the elders who does this honor, but Lan Wangji imagines this is a lesson, perhaps a warning, to the younger disciples watching.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are few sounds to break the morning quiet: the measured crack of the whip splitting into skin and muscle. The involuntary sounds torn from Lan Wangji\u2019s throat, at the impact, harsh in the silence. The hush and occasional hum of the wind through the trees.</p>\n<p>His family is also in attendance, toward the front of the gathered crowd. His xiongzhang\u2019s chin angles downward and sidelong, his expression contorted with pain, as though he cannot bear to look. Shufu, by contrast, forces himself to watch, visibly trembling with the effort of doing so \u2014 his eyes watery, his wispy beard bobbing with the flex of his jaw. As if, in so doing, he is eliciting his own punishment.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji inclines his head, the fall of his unbound hair eclipsing them from view. With the agonizing shock of the whip having settled into his body, over and over, the pain has gradually become more comprehensible. The first few strokes had been the worst. Halfway, now; he has counted each lash. More than the pain, he can feel the cold sting of autumn air on his open wounds, the wet flow of blood down his back and sides. The reality of his destroyed body, of his skin\u2019s permanent ruination, has not yet set in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grits his teeth, and braces in the stillness.</p>\n<p>Lan Sizheng pauses, as though for dramatic effect. Lan Wangji patiently waits.</p>\n<p>Then, Lan Sizheng speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang-jun, Lan Wangji, do you condemn the behavior of the Yiling Laozu, Wei Wuxian?\u201d he demands. \u201cDo you repent for your association with evil and your misconduct of GusuLan\u2019s disciplines?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, so they expect a public flagellation beyond flesh. Lan Wangji keeps his head bowed as he answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is my soulmate,\u201d he says, the words thick through a coppery mouthful of blood. Low, but loud enough to be ring clear to every Lan in attendance, the sea of eyes that watch him take his punishment with undisguised amazement and disgust.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At these words, the quiet ripple of disapproval is tangible. At last, shufu looks away.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not care. That mere fact, its conviction, is beautiful and blinding. With the blows, he at last feels free, his love for Wei Ying an uncaged bird sky-bound. The whip is a punishment he welcomes \u2014 not for breaching his sect rules, but for not realizing what he would do for Wei Ying sooner. Until it was too late.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever he has done, right or wrong, I will shoulder the consequences with him,\u201d Lan Wangji says to the wintry silence of his peers.</p>\n<p>The red of his thread pulses in him like a heartbeat. Again, the whip cracks down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An undefined span of time after, Lan Wangji wakes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has woken a handful of times, since the whipping, but never for too long. Usually, he is alone, or Lan-daifu hovers over him silently, tending to him without a word. When he wakes now, an undefined span of time after his whipping, his xiongzhang is seated at his bedside, watching him. His expression is grim, worn into faded lines of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>He rubs his eyes when he sees Lan Wangji is awake and says, roughly, \u201cWangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cXiongzhang,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers through dry lips, and tries to blink through the white haze that gauzes the corners of his vision. Right now, the pain of his whipping wounds is subdued. He has been immobile for several shichen, which helps keep the split skin closed, and Lan-daifu\u2019s needles have taken their full effect. He blinks again at Lan Xichen, wondering at the strange expression on his face.</p>\n<p>Something is...not right. He can sense it in the careful way his brother is looking at him, like he is fragile. Like he is porcelain, one crack from shattering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dread hardens into a bezoar in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen whispers, his shoulders sagging. \u201cI am...so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The response doesn\u2019t make any sense; his xiongzhang hasn\u2019t said anything yet. Dizzy, hazy with narcotics and the muffled pain arcing through his every nerve, it\u2019s all he\u2019s able to say. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches his brother\u2019s mouth move soundlessly, shaped around familiar syllables, the sound muted like they\u2019re underwater. It is what Lan Wangji has dreaded, for months, that he would hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d Lan Xichen\u2019s lips move, noiseless. \u201cHe\u2026 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, firmly. He sounds like a child throwing a tantrum, but he doesn\u2019t care. The sear of his conviction pierces through the herbs that have kept him, for weeks, floating in and out of unconsciousness. What <em> about </em> Wei Ying, he tries to ask. Wei Ying is okay. Wei Ying is always okay, Wei Ying is under his protection.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen reaches out and steels a hand to Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, his fingers careful to avoid the uppermost tips of his wounds. Lan Wangji looks up at him, uncomprehending, his eyes swimming with exhaustion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His xiongzhang studies his expression with his brows pinched, then takes a sharp breath, as though to brace himself.</p>\n<p>\n<em> No. No, no, no, no no nonono \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d his brother says, worn with emotion but as steady as he\u2019s always been, since their boyhood. A crag at sea, weathering the lash of a storm\u2019s fury. \u201cWei Wuxian is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, again. He hears it as though hollowed down a long tunnel, from somewhere far away. Wei Ying, bright and beautiful and summer incarnate, flashes of a crimson hair ribbon and big, toothy smiles, crinkled eyes and warm waterfalls of words; Wei Ying, not alive, is an impossibility. It won\u2019t catch in his mind; it slides off him like water, edgeless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji starts to struggle, pushing against Lan Xichen\u2019s hand. The unhealed wounds, still torn open, flare on his back with an agony that makes sweat pour off his temples. He has been bedridden up to this point, hardly conscious, but his cultivation is still strong enough to make it to the Burial Mounds. He will find Wei Ying, take him away again, hide him somewhere, in another cave or in a secluded corner of Gusu or off the edges of the known world, if he needs to. He will prove his brother wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji ah,\u201d Lan Xichen says, his voice breaking. His brother does not cry. \u201cPlease, Wangji, you are sick. Lay back and rest, and we can talk more when you are lucid, A-Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slaps his brother\u2019s hand away, suddenly furious. Who is his brother to try and stop him? Wei Ying is waiting for him, Wei Ying is \u2014</p>\n<p>The motion of the slap brings his wrist into focus, and he blinks, unseeing, then says, \u201cNo,\u201d again, softer. Almost a question.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, louder. Uncomprehending. \u201c<em>No.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Is that all his wretched, drug-addled mind can say? It\u2019s the only thing he can feel, its own emotion through the shock of numb cold that spreads through him like an ice-melt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s dreaming, or \u2014 hallucinating, from the drugs. The black thread is not meant for him. It was his father\u2019s curse, not meant for him or Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>For a long time, Lan Wangji stares at the limp, black string on his wrist while his brother waits with his breath held. He can hear his own breathing, panicked and noisy in his ears, as though it\u2019s apart from himself. There\u2019s something beginning to howl in him, frenzied and wild.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidi,\u201d xiongzhang says, when the silence stretches on and on.</p>\n<p>The urgent press of nausea in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach causes him to bend over, despite the spasm of anguish across his back, and he vomits into the basin next to his bed. He hasn\u2019t eaten anything in days, but he keeps retching bile and water until there is nothing left inside him. His xiongzhang can\u2019t touch his back, his burning, rent-open mess of flesh, so he presses a cool hand to the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck and squeezes, over and over.</p>\n<p>There is no grief, not yet; like the suspended moment between a cut and his nerves registering pain. He floats in this space, frozen and numb.</p>\n<p>He only has one clear thought that rings out inside him, like the peal of a clarity bell, as his brother\u2019s white robes, the healing pavilion begin to fade around the edges.</p>\n<p>For the first time since he was eight years old, Lan Wangji is entirely alone in the world.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<u> <b>PART II.</b> </u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the course of thirteen years, Hanguang-jun cuts an impressive figure in the collective imaginary of the cultivation world.</p>\n<p>They say Hanguang-jun wears all white to mourn his dead soulmate even as the years creep on; that his soul had once been tied to the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s with the red string. Can you imagine, it\u2019s murmured, Yue Lao binding two such opposites? Light and dark, day and night, justice and chaos, good and evil, yin and yang. Some say Hanguang-jun\u2019s soul had passed on with Wei Wuxian\u2019s when it had left this world \u2014 how else to account for the cold deadness in his gaze, as empty as the arctic north?</p>\n<p>There are other, odder rumors too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That Hanguang-jun had adopted a wild Wen child and raised him Lan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That over the years, night hunts in the smallest, most forgotten villages are cleaned up overnight. Sometimes, locals claim to catch a whisk of moon-pale robes, a gleam of a silver sword. A silent and faceless vigilante.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That the Yiling Patriarch had never died at all; that Hanguang-jun keeps him tucked away deep in the mountain caves of Gusu, feeding him the blood and flesh he needs to survive.</p>\n<p>That during even the most unforgiving winters, Hanguang-jun roams the Burial Mounds with a qin strapped to his back, playing for the long-lost soul of his lover. (<em>We can hear the guqin singing at night, far up in the mountains, </em>the Yiling locals have said in hushed voices.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there are other facts beyond rumor, ascertained by anyone who glimpses Hanguang-jun on the street of various towns, passing by.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a visible shock of color on his wrist, layered over the black thread, he wears a crimson hair-ribbon, knotted tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In some ways, the first year is the easiest, because Lan Wangji spends so much of it unconscious. After branding himself in a drunken stupor, after his fevered flight to the Burial Mounds to seek out Wei Ying and his return with a dying A-Yuan, his body crumples into the fatigue of his new physical existence. Days, sometimes weeks, pass by outside of his awareness. As soon as Lan Wangji is accustomed to one season, a glance out the jingshi\u2019s window shows the world has steadily moved on into the next.</p>\n<p>The second year is harder, when he is more lucid. His xiongzhang visits for longer periods of time in the second year, which means Lan Wangji is required to dress beyond his inner robe, to sit upright until the muscles of his back spasm with pain, to pretend to engage in conversation even as he sweats and bleeds through his layers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shufu visits him three times, perhaps out of obligation, but each one is briefer than the last. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s too painful to see his nephew this way \u2014 immobile, shaking with fatigue, almost entirely devoid of life \u2014 or if the disappointment and shame of his failure are still simply too much to stomach.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has bled through nearly every pair of inner robes he owns. The scars pull open with the barest of movements, weeping watery blood and pus. It\u2019s worse in the winters and during the rainy season; on the worst of those days, he is entirely bedridden, his teeth rattling and grinding as he makes himself rigid against the pain. Sometimes his muscles lock up completely, spasm so that he cannot move for hours. Not that he would, anyway.</p>\n<p>Sleeping is difficult, at first. Not solely from the pain, or the nightmares. After a lifetime of learning to sleep on his back, trying to sleep on his stomach is uncomfortable, unnatural.</p>\n<p>The physical pain is a welcome reprieve, in some ways. The sharpness, the loudness of it is a distraction from the much deeper agony, the one that cuts marrow-deep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes in Lan Wangji\u2019s dreams, his mind plays out, in lurid detail, the various and grisly scenarios in which Wei Ying must have died \u2014 blood-soaked and half-crazed with resentment and utterly alone. Ripped to pieces by fierce corpses, impaled on a sword, his body broken and beaten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has heard it said that Jiang Wanyin himself had led the final siege of the Burial Mounds, that Wei Ying had died by his hand. Perhaps Wei Ying had spent his last breath looking into the blaze of Jiang Wanyin\u2019s hatred, had died knowing he was spurned by one of the last people alive that he still loved.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In even more of his dreams, Wei Ying is still alive, a preserved shard of those early summer days of Gusu. Lan Wangji dreams of Wei Ying running through the bamboo forest on the back mountain and laughing, looking over his shoulder and calling teasingly for Lan Wangji to catch up. As hard as he tries, Lan Wangji never can. He runs his fastest, tries his hardest, even stretches out a hand to grab at his black robes, but each time, Wei Ying is too far ahead, smiling and silent out of his reach.</p>\n<p>The dreams that hurt the most are those in which the least happens. These dreams are quiet. Wei Ying is in the jingshi, calling him <em> husband </em> and <em> baobei </em> and <em> Lan Zhan, dear, </em>bundled up in his bed or running a bath or making tea. From these dreams, Lan Wangji wakes with tears already dried to his cheeks, as though his body had known the truth before his mind could catch up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every new day that he wakes up into a world without Wei Ying is an ugly shock that never dulls, a loop of reliving to remind him of all that\u2019s transpired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each morning, Lan Wangji looks at the black thread, dead and limp on his wrist, and thinks of the days when it had glowed red, of every day that he had taken for granted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His third year of seclusion is when his shufu brings the doctor into the jingshi.</p>\n<p>At first, Lan Wangji suspects nothing amiss. Doctors often come to see him, to treat his wounds and provide him pain medication or ointments, and it isn\u2019t so unusual that shufu would bring a doctor from another sect, perhaps to offer an alternative remedy, apart from GusuLan medicine.</p>\n<p>The doctor is named Shi Jianyu. He is older, bearded and dressed in green robes, and there\u2019s a strange, cat-like glow to his violet eyes. He watches Lan Wangji with an incisive assessment, as though silently diagnosing him, before his gaze flits to the black thread around Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist and settles there.</p>\n<p>\u201cShufu,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and blinks tiredly. \u201cWangji apologizes that he cannot formally receive you and our guest.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s simply too exhausted today. It had rained the previous night, and the humidity is wreaking hell on his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d his shufu replies. \u201cWangji may be familiar with Shi-daifu\u2019s line of work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji waits, uncomprehending.</p>\n<p>\u201cI specialize in surgery of spirit,\u201d Shi Jianyu says with a dip of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have thoroughly reviewed his credentials,\u201d shufu adds. \u201cShi-daifu has performed countless operations, and his success rate is very high.\u201d</p>\n<p>The signs, in retrospect, are all there, but Lan Wangji is still not following. Pain medication tends to dull his mental acuity, often leaving him steps behind in a conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurgery,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes Shi Jianyu. \u201cWhat surgery is necessary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan-xiansheng has told me of your soulmate\u2019s death,\u201d Shi Jianyu says, as matter-of-factly as a weather report, and Lan Wangji recoils at the unexpected blow of it. \u201cBlack threads are actually the easiest to remove, if Hanguang-jun can believe, because there is no risk of damaging the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p>All at once, too late, Lan Wangji understands, a horrible nausea rising fast in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShufu,\u201d he whispers. The betrayal he feels is so stunning that he momentarily cannot say anything beyond that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d shufu answers, steady and unrepentant. \u201cI know the black thread pains you, as it did my brother. Shi-daifu can offer relief from your burden, if you will allow him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can feel himself start to shake. It makes the wounds pull tighter, twinges of agony.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for Shi-daifu\u2019s visit,\u201d Lan Wangji finally says, when he finds he is able to speak again, \u201cas I am sure he has traveled long, but his trip has been in vain. I have no need of this service.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wangji</em>,\u201d shufu says, more harshly, while Shi Jianyu blinks in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack threads can be an impediment to negotiating future partnerships, as I\u2019m sure Hanguang-jun can understand,\u201d Shi Jianyu says, earnestly, as though there\u2019s a chance Lan Wangji can be persuaded. \u201cI can promise that the removal is painless, and I have never received a complaint after an operation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will not be necessary,\u201d Lan Wangji says, past formality. His tone is so cold, so teeth-clenched that the doctor flinches in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d shufu says, raising his voice. \u201cShi-daifu has come all this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe black thread,\u201d Shi Jianyu interjects, \u201cit can be a nuisance to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is all I have left of him.\u201d The words rip out of him before he can stop himself, a raw scrape of his throat, and the immediate silence that follows is sharper, somehow, louder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of the blood has drained from shufu\u2019s face. He stares at Lan Wangji as though he does not know him, with a strange sort of horror.</p>\n<p>The awful silence stretches on and on, before Shi Jianyu says, perhaps in an attempt at mollification, \u201cI...can see there has been a misunderstanding, and that Jianyu has been misinformed of the situation. Please forgive this one\u2019s imposition, Hanguang-jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say a word as shufu and the doctor leave. He does not stop shaking for several minutes after.<br><br></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is silent that evening after his meal with xiongzhang. He is always quiet, but he knows the arctic tone of this silence will not go unmissed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even more so than angry, Lan Wangji feels betrayed. Lan Xichen had known of shufu\u2019s intentions and had not forewarned him, had allowed that doctor into a space he has dedicated to grieving Wei Ying. Though they do not speak of it, his xiongzhang is perhaps the only person on earth that Lan Wangji thought would understand him, in at least this matter. After everything witnessed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite Lan Wangji\u2019s cold silence, Lan Xichen talks in an upbeat cadence for several moments as though nothing is amiss. He fills the silence with news of A-Yuan, the friends he\u2019s slowly making among his peers, and of other sect news, a marriage here and there, a birth, the death of a smaller sect leader.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lan Xichen sets down his tea and says, in the same neutral tone of voice, \u201cI\u2019m sure that Wangji knows shufu will not apologize for bringing Shi-daifu to visit. Nonetheless, he is apologetic. He knows now that it was too soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels a sting of cold that aches down to his nerves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo soon,\u201d he echoes, woodenly. They are the first words he\u2019s uttered all evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen says, more gently. He puts a hand on the table, almost as if to reach out to him, but Lan Wangji\u2019s knuckles curl inward, an infinitesimal recoiling. Lan Xichen pulls his hand back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji looks up at him, his brother\u2019s eyes are kind and deeply sad. He looks more tired than Lan Wangji has ever seen him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d xiongzhang says quietly. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>How could he possibly understand? Lan Wangji wonders. His xiongzhang\u2019s thread still glimmers on his wrist, as silver and bright as a river current. His xiongzhang visits with Jin Guangyao once a month to commiserate about the trials of sect leadership, to laugh and gossip and warmly share tea. He has the assurance of his person in the world. Lan Xichen could never understand. No one can.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen takes a deep breath, and Lan Wangji knows this means he is treading carefully for his next step. It means the subject matter of conversation will be fraught.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Lan Xichen says, \u201cI know you are still...mourning.\u201d There\u2019s an unspoken agreement between them to never speak Wei Ying\u2019s name aloud. It flays open another wound in Lan Wangji each time, a gaping lash more painful than his scars. \u201cBut once you emerge from seclusion, there will be certain...expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji knows very well what his brother means. Lan Wangji is twenty-four years old, the second master of his sect and a well-known cultivator, and now free of his ties to Wei Wuxian, apart from the thread on his wrist. The cultivation world will not only expect him to marry, but will watch keenly for his public dissociation from Wei Ying. They will look for a quiet denouncement, for repentance, for a humble acknowledgement of error, for reparations through an advantageous and palatable marriage.</p>\n<p>They will not find it. Any of it. Lan Wangji is shaking, from all of it: the exhaustion, the pain, the anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d xiongzhang says. He\u2019s watching Lan Wangji closely, no doubt observing this conviction in the stiff set of Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders, the rigid tightness of his jaw. \u201cKeeping the black thread, with your status and with its previous...attachment. It will ensure that you never marry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t <em> care. </em> The idea of being married to anyone else besides Wei Ying makes him ill to the point of nausea. It reminds him of his childhood convictions, that stubborn but desperate <em> no </em>that rings around and around in him. That he would share himself with anyone else, his raw, bloody patchwork of scars and memory and grief, is unthinkable. Even if he were to marry another, he would spend every waking moment cast in the shadow of Wei Ying\u2019s death. For the rest of his life, he will spend his days loving someone who he will never see again, who will never again share this world with him.</p>\n<p>At once, Lan Wangji is drained; beyond anger, beyond grief, a state of numbness, total depletion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am tired,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, suddenly unable to contain his weariness. \u201cI must ask xiongzhang to excuse me for the evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a rude dismissal, especially by Lan Wangji\u2019s standards. He will need to apologize to his brother. For tonight, he has no spare room inside himself to care.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Lan Xichen says, softly, and then nothing else. He takes his cue and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After this third year, Lan Wangji is allowed limited visits with A-Yuan. The interactions quickly become the best part of Lan Wangji\u2019s weeks, one of the only things he finds himself looking forward to.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan has grown quickly in those three years, and he is quieter than he once was; no longer a wild toddler tearing around a bustling campsite, among seniors who were far too busy with other tasks to mind his behavior. It\u2019s a small shock to see him clean and groomed, so well-mannered and reserved, dressed in the white robes Lan Wangji remembers wearing as a boy.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen already told Lan Wangji, some time ago, that A-Yuan has forgotten the Burial Mounds, everything before his life at the Cloud Recesses. The fever had effectively burned a hole right through his memory. Nonetheless, the boy does remember Lan Wangji, and asks for him every so often.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen brings A-Yuan to the jingshi on the first day, a green summer morning gummy with humidity. It is strange for Lan Wangji to see him interacting with A-Yuan; strange to think, that in these years of seclusion, his xiongzhang has come to know Wei Ying\u2019s child better than he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Han-guang-jun,\u201d A-Yuan says with careful enunciation, and Lan Xichen smiles and pats his head as if to commend him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The title almost feels too formal, coming from A-Yuan, and Lan Wangji almost opens his mouth to gently correct him, but blanks at an alternative. What can he ask A-Yuan to call him? Lan-gege? Baba? A-Yuan had tearfully called him \u201ca-die\u201d once, but that would not be appropriate or correct. No, nothing else fits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will leave you two to enjoy your time together,\u201d Lan Xichen says, in pleasant tones, and he slips away.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps A-Yuan\u2019s small hand in his as they make their way slowly toward the back mountain. Though he rarely leaves the jingshi, this outing has a purpose. He had begged his xiongzhang to care for the rabbits while he was bedridden, and though his disapproval had been clear, Lan Xichen had agreed, and had instructed a few of the juniors to feed the rabbits every day and to not question this singular exception of the rules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is slow going, though. It isn\u2019t often Lan Wangji travels beyond the jingshi, and every few moments, he has to stop and gasp through the pain, through the throb of his scars as A-Yuan waits patiently, gripping onto his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-jun says gege hurt his back,\u201d A-Yuan says, watching him with a bright, careful curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji manages, and gently tugs A-Yuan forward again so they can walk together. \u201cSome days, it hurts more than others.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan seems to reflect on that for a moment, before he asks, \u201cWalking hurts it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we sit?\u201d A-Yuan suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cSoon, we will,\u201d Lan Wangji answers.</p>\n<p>The rabbits have grown, both in size and population. There are at least twenty-five now when he and A-Yuan reach them, picking among the grasses. A-Yuan\u2019s eyes widen with shocked delight when he sees them. He turns his face up to Lan Wangji with a fierce but dubious hope, as though he\u2019s uncertain of what he\u2019s allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever seen these rabbits before, A-Yuan?\u201d Lan Wangji asks him, and A-Yuan shakes his head, chewing on one of his fingers as he turns back to watch the rabbits with wide eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji guides them forward, and the rabbits don\u2019t scatter at their arrival. No doubt the juniors have spoiled them into a lazy indulgence, to where they\u2019ve lost their more primal instincts and can welcome the presence of humans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite the twist of pain in his back, a scream of it that leaves him shaking and sweating, Lan Wangji gently hefts A-Yuan up to deposit him in the fluffy pile of rabbits. A-Yuan shrieks with overjoyed laughter, wiggling and flailing among the rabbits as they skitter away, spooked by the shrill noises and by the introduction of a small child into their peaceful existence.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s face aches, and he realizes he is smiling for the first time in three years.</p>\n<p>He teaches A-Yuan how to gentle his voice, how to be as quiet as possible so the rabbits will trust him and come near, to eat carrots out of his tiny hands. Then, exhausted, he sits on the nearest grassy incline, content to watch A-Yuan play with the rabbits and feed them in silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a while of this, A-Yuan approaches him a little shyly, interested in his attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cHan-guang-jun,\u201d A-Yuan says, still careful with the syllables. He reaches out to touch the headband, and on reflex, Lan Wangji flinches. \u201cZewu-jun has a pretty one too. What is it, gege?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, so A-Yuan is still too young to have been taught this. Lan Wangji is strangely pleased to be the one to explain it.</p>\n<p>\u201cForehead ribbon,\u201d he answers. \u201cOne day, you will also have one. But you can never touch any headband that is not your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan obediently retracts his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>How to explain this to a child? How had it been explained to him? Lan Wangji hesitates, then answers, \u201cThe headband means to regulate yourself. It is only for your family to touch.\u201d He swallows around a jagged-glass feeling in his throat before he concludes, \u201cAnd your soulmate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoul-mate,\u201d A-Yuan echoes, enunciating it carefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, Lan Wangji has missed being around children. It has been so, so long. He has a special fondness for their endless questions, and he can tell, even this young, that A-Yuan is exceptionally bright for his age. Wei Ying would be so proud to see him, he thinks, with a shudder of anguish.</p>\n<p>\u201cA soulmate is a special person who is meant for you in this world,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His voice sounds rough even to his own ears, and A-Yuan seems to track the emotion, observing it like he would an insect trapped in a jar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this, gege?\u201d A-Yuan asks in the same tone as before, and this time, he reaches for Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>Too abruptly for the situation, too harshly for a child\u2019s understanding, Lan Wangji rips his hand away, and A-Yuan freezes, as if stunned. He stares at Lan Wangji with big eyes, his lower lip starting to wobble.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not angry,\u201d Lan Wangji assures him before any tears can fall. \u201cShh, A-Yuan, shh. I am not angry. This is another thing not to be touched.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan sniffles wetly, but seems appeased by the soft tones, to know Lan Wangji is not upset with him. In a thick voice, he asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thread is also for your soulmate,\u201d Lan Wangji says. This, he truly is too exhausted to explain. \u201cYou will know when you\u2019re older.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan frowns, his lower lip jutting. \u201cZewu-jun always says that.\u201d Then he adds, \u201cZewu-jun has one too. How come Hanguang-jun\u2019s is a different color?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes, breathes through his nose. Then he says, \u201cA black thread means your soulmate is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGone,\u201d A-Yuan repeats, his brows furrowing into a tiny frown. \u201cWhy is gege\u2019s soulmate gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows at this question, the pain of it stabbing into his chest like a sharp object embedded there, like gravel or a broken tooth. The reason, he wants to tell this child, is senseless. There is no reason at all for why Wei Ying shouldn\u2019t still be alive in the world, raising A-Yuan himself, watching him grow older and more brilliant each day. No reason at all, other than that Lan Wangji had failed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you are older,\u201d he says, gently, and A-Yuan fully pouts at him, his lower lip sticking out. Surely he has been told not to pout by his seniors, but the expression is so Wei Ying that Lan Wangji cannot chide him. He feels his heart sink painfully in his chest, then soar like a kite caught on a breeze.</p>\n<p>For a long time, Lan Wangji had thought the black thread was all that he had left of Wei Ying. He has forgotten, in his seclusion away from A-Yuan, that there is one other person, alive in this world, who Wei Ying had shaped before he\u2019d gone. Who had known what it was to love him. His throat feels as tight as a drum.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d A-Yuan says softly, and reaches out to put a hand on Lan Wangji\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhy is gege crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches A-Yuan play quietly among the rabbits until he can take the sitting no longer, and he walks A-Yuan back to the jingshi on shaky legs. They are quiet the whole way, and when they return, Lan Xichen is waiting for them on the porch with a small smile and his hands clasped behind his back. Lan Wangji tells A-Yuan goodbye, and his xiongzhang leads him away by the hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cGege, can I come back to play with the rabbits again?\u201d he hears A-Yuan ask Lan Xichen as they go.</p>\n<p>Later that night, after their evening meal, Lan Xichen tells him, \u201cWangji, you seem happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes are bright, more so than Lan Wangji has seen from him in a long time. He looks hopeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpending time with A-Yuan,\u201d Lan Wangji answers, carefully. \u201cIt was...good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Lan Xichen says. \u201cI think you will both be good for each other. I know he has missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwice a week,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. \u201cIf you can arrange it. If I can see him...twice a week, that would be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen takes a deep, measured breath. Lan Wangji knows that arranging even a weekly meeting with A-Yuan had likely been a carefully negotiated battle with shufu, but he is too desperate not to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will need to ensure it does not interfere with his studies,\u201d Lan Xichen says slowly. \u201cA-Yuan is nearly old enough to begin regular classes. Shufu will not like it. Neither will the elders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I will try,\u201d Lan Xichen says, and Lan Wangji lowers his head in thanks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, slowly, like the melt of a glacier, Lan Wangji\u2019s wounds heal.</p>\n<p>If only it were so easy, so automatic to heal beyond flesh, he thinks often. He thinks about the steady internal motions of his body, its organic rhythms continuing outside his awareness. The miracle of skin knitting itself back together, scabbing over and ripping and scabbing over again. He thinks of the unconscious churn of his heart, which keeps beating even as his more proverbial one has long gone from this world. He thinks of his qi, which requires more conscious focus to cultivate, but nonetheless flows within him as a natural bloodstream.</p>\n<p>Everything else heals, except Wei Ying\u2019s absence. It remains a ragged, gaping, bloody hole inside him that skin and bone cannot graft over. He is not sure he wants it to. Other than the thread and A-Yuan, his grief is all he has left of Wei Ying. To close that wound, he thinks, would be to lose him entirely, so he keeps it flayed open.</p>\n<p>The moment his imprisonment is lifted, Lan Wangji returns to the Burial Mounds a final time to seek answers \u2014 for remains, a response through Inquiry, anything at all that could inform him of what had happened to Wei Ying in those final days. To live, not knowing, is a more agonizing burden than whatever ugly truth could be revealed.</p>\n<p>But Lan Wangji finds nothing but ash and the bones of strangers, the seething resentment of the dead, and, when he plays Inquiry, an empty and ringing silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does not know why he had dared to hope, but there is no sign of Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>The end of his seclusion and the eventual healing of his wounds mark his reentry into the cultivation world. Staggered at first, and then more steadily, Lan Xichen hands Lan Wangji tasks and assignments to aid with sect leadership. Once he can move without his wounds reopening, without needing to pause to reel and gasp for breath, Lan Wangji takes on night hunts with a renewed fervor. Night hunts are wholly distracting; they are purposeful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They are also a means to keep a pulse on odd events and occurrences. Demonic cultivation had not died with Wei Ying, and has in fact flourished from his legacy. Lan Wangji takes dozens of hunts involving demonic cultivation, and they are never Wei Ying, but each time, the grief wound howls with a hope he cannot stamp out, no matter his rationalizations.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s on one of these night hunts in Jiangling, six years and two hundred and seven days after Wei Ying\u2019s death, that Lan Wangji has the misfortune of encountering Jiang Wanyin for the first time.</p>\n<p>It is not unusual that cultivators from different sects overlap on night hunts; it is even less unusual that Lan Wangji would run into Jiang Wanyin during a hunt so close to Lotus Pier. Still, it\u2019s an unpleasant shock to see that particular face, its familiar scowl and sharp lines that have only hardened with the passing years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last time Lan Wangji had seen Jiang Wanyin, it had been on a battlefield. His face had been contorted beyond recognition as he had screamed threats at Wei Ying, clutching his dead sister. He had screamed that he would kill Wei Wuxian for what he\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has heard various news of Jiang Wanyin over the years, the more he reacclimates to life in the cultivation world \u2014 the usual whispers of his involvement in the death of the Yiling Patriarch, but also his current endeavors to ensure, in the case Wei Wuxian returns, that he stay dead.</p>\n<p>That evening, Lan Wangji should have foreseen, by the cluster of familiar purple hanfus outside the inn, that there would be danger, but he had not. He had walked in despite this observation, and his eyes had landed immediately on the sharp-edged figure of Jiang Wanyin, drinking a jar of liquor alone at one of the tables.</p>\n<p>Before Lan Wangji can slip away, up to his rooms undetected as he would prefer, Jiang Wanyin\u2019s eyes land on his and snap wide. His face hardens before a harsh, mirthless smirk curls up against his cheek, the curve of a knife.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji certainly can\u2019t leave now that Jiang Wanyin has seen him and intends to make a confrontation of this. He holds his head high, rooted to his place as Jiang Wanyin stalks across the inn toward him, his violet cloak billowing behind him with each thundering step.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says as he approaches, and does not bother to salute him. \u201cWhat an unhappy surprise to see you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-zongzhu,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, then nothing else. He does not trust himself to speak. Jiang Wanyin\u2019s proximity has brought a long-banked rage bubbling to the surface, a simmer low in his throat. He is unsure yet what it will prompt him to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an honor that Yunmeng is blessed with Hanguang-jun\u2019s presence,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says through his teeth. \u201cWhat has our lowly Jiangling done to deserve such grace?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hates him. He does not hate many people, assuming an indifference toward most, but this buzzing scorch of loathing suddenly chokes him, almost frightening in its fervor. Frightening, because he could kill this man where he stands and feel no compunction for it. He could kill this man where he stands and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight-hunt,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his lips hardly moving. He keeps his expression entirely still, each facial muscle frozen. \u201cPassing through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch few words for an old friend?\u201d Jiang Wanyin mocks. \u201cLan er-gongzi, you used to be so chatty! I thought we could have a drink together, reminisce about our old days.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words are an unintentional echo of those Wei Ying had said to him so long ago, earnest and sweet, upon their reunion in Yiling, and there\u2019s an ache in Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw, the crunch of his teeth grinding in his ears. He holds his tongue. He just needs to weather Jiang Wanyin, like an acid rain, and then it will be over.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear interesting things about Hanguang-jun these days,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says, baring his teeth into a sneer. \u201cHow he appears in the middle of chaos, even in the most remote of places. Could it be that he\u2019s searching for someone in particular?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI too have heard interesting news of Jiang-zongzhu,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, a venomous strike before he can stop himself. \u201cThat he hunts, captures, and murders anyone who resembles his former sect brother. Tell me \u2014 was killing him once not enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hears Jiang Wanyin\u2019s teeth snap together at the same time Zidian crackles to life, a vicious thrum between them. Some of the patrons nearby scatter away from them with sounds of alarm.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so Hanguang-jun <em> is </em>chatty today,\u201d Jiang Wanyin spits out. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not move at the threat, just keeps his hand sealed tight to Bichen. He has no fear of Zidian, and even less of Jiang Wanyin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Wanyin\u2019s gaze falls to Bichen, then catches on the red ribbon around his wrist. His expression cycles abruptly through several emotions: disbelief, then a white-hot fury, then a slow, cold scorn.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it <em> is </em>true,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says with an ugly laugh. \u201cThat you wear the fucking hair ribbon. I thought it was some insipid rumor that bored maidens had spun up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tightens his hand over Bichen, holds steady. Jiang Wanyin will attempt to strike where it hurts the most, as is his way, but Lan Wangji has long been impervious to such blows. He curls around the claim to his grief as armor, as possessive as a wolf with its young. He clings to it with a teeth-bared animalism.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you think he belonged to you,\u201d Jiang Wanyin continues, dripping with scorn, with contempt. \u201cGiven you were <em> soulmates </em>and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji holds his head high, tamping down on the tremors of rage that threaten to show on his face, in his hands. He will not let Jiang Wanyin, this broken, petty, bitter <em> child </em>of a man, provoke him into discomposure; to ever make Wei Ying out to be less to him than he was. He has long been mocked, derided, judged, punished for his loyalty to Wei Ying, by nearly everyone he can think of. This is no different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, if Lan Wangji has a sensibility of words that can cut Jiang Wanyin to bone, his ability is well-matched. Like the practiced slip of a blade, neat between two ribs, Jiang Wanyin says then, with a curl of his lip, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you still wear white, when he died before he ever loved you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not move consciously. He only knows that one moment he\u2019s motionless, and the next, the whetted tip of Bichen is digging into the beating point of Jiang Wanyin\u2019s jugular, a red aura clinging to the corners of his vision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A wild light dances in Jiang Wanyin\u2019s eyes as his chest heaves with adrenaline, his features lit a ghoulish violet by the crackling glow of Zidian. His mouth curves open into a joyless, fervent laugh. \u201c<em> Good </em>! I\u2019ve always wanted a real fight with you! Go on, then, Lan er-gongzi \u2014 kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels his own lip curl as he fumes, Jiang Wanyin at the end of his blade. It would be so easy to end this man. To avenge Wei Ying\u2019s every hurt by Jiang Wanyin\u2019s hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment stretches on and on, interminable.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says at last. He withdraws his sword, ignoring the bizarre flash of disappointment that twists across Jiang Wanyin\u2019s features as he does. \u201cI think you should live, Jiang-zongzhu.\u201d</p>\n<p>In his words is an unspoken sentencing that Lan Wangji knows will not go unmissed. Sure enough, Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face twists, a rigid mask of rage as Lan Wangji turns to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you to pass judgment on me, Lan Wangji?\u201d Jiang Wanyin screams at his retreating back. \u201cHe was never yours!\u201d</p>\n<p>As if Lan Wangji needs reminding. Although he knows it was Jiang Wanyin\u2019s very intention, those words nestle under his skin and remain, ringing in his ears for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The earth turns, season by season and year by year, and Lan Wangji follows, as he must.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world without Wei Ying is the same as before, it seems, for everyone except Lan Wangji. He sees Wei Ying\u2019s absence in everything, every day, as the rhythms of life whir on without him. For example: Sunlight remains, but its warmth is gone. The springs and summers in the mountains hum with greenery and vibrance, but Lan Wangji feels nothing but perpetual winter, a curious and austere deadness. The fact that the world can maintain its cadence of life without Wei Ying seems strangely absurd. The fact that Lan Wangji is expected, also, to live in the world without him, is even stranger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he does live, due to lack of alternative. He raises A-Yuan, teaches disciples, continues to lead night hunts, and maintains his relationship with his uncle and brother.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The black thread on Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist is his only remaining tether to Wei Ying. The only physical proof that he had existed and been loved at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s sense of timekeeping over those years relies primarily on Sizhui. His triumphs, his tears; the progress of his lessons, his first friends who become his best friends, his successes and his scraped knees alike. Perhaps to compensate for his own parents\u2019 absence, Lan Wangji firmly ensures his presence in Sizhui\u2019s life is never in question. He is not a smothering person by nature, nor an openly demonstrative one, but he nonetheless involves himself in each sphere of Sizhui\u2019s life: his cultivation training, his guqin lessons, his swordplay. Eventually, his shufu gives up on visibly airing out his disapproval about it, and lets Lan Wangji do with the child what he will.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few years of A-Yuan\u2019s peerless education, the murmurs and rumors abate entirely, and A-Yuan\u2019s Wen surname disappears from the Lan sect\u2019s intrigue like a mist. Only Lan Wangji, his xiongzhang, and shufu know the truth.</p>\n<p>When he is fifteen, Lan Yuan takes the courtesy name Sizhui, as well as his sword and jade key. He leads his first night hunt, a small yaoguai case close to home, and then two. Then ten.</p>\n<p>By the time they receive a report of a dark presence at the manor of a non-cultivational sect in Qishan, Sizhui has led more than twenty hunts without help from Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him before Sizhui and the rest of the juniors set off. \u201cDo not take risks. If you find trouble, set off the flare and I will come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sizhui nods along to each word with an unresentful patience, although they both know he has no need of Lan Wangji\u2019s advice. Lan Wangji does not need to give it, but finds himself compelled to anyway, based on a deep and simmering feeling of...anxiety, for lack of a better word. He of course trusts Sizhui\u2019s abilities implicitly \u2014\u00a0he is the most skilled of his peers \u2014 but the concern never abates. This, Lan Wangji has discovered many times over, is fatherhood.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Lan Wangji tells Sizhui gently. \u201cDo well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Hanguang-jun,\u201d Sizhui replies with a quick bow, and with the rest of the juniors in tow, he sets off for Mo Manor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sizhui and the rest of the juniors keep the situation under control admirably for the first couple of days, but it quickly becomes evident that the haunting at Mo Manor is work for a more experienced cultivator, so Lan Wangji steps in to help after Sizhui summons him with the flare.</p>\n<p>Sizhui is luckily intact after this tangle, as are the other juniors, though the same cannot be said for the Mo family.</p>\n<p>Sizhui provides a full report to him afterward as they make their way toward Fojiao Village through the surrounding woods.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is strange, Hanguang-jun,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji. \u201cThere was a man at the manor named Mo Xuanyu who disappeared after the fight. When we were trying to suppress the hand and the other puppets, he used a cultivation technique to help us I have never seen before. He knew all of our materials too; most others don\u2019t recognize them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hope flares bright in Lan Wangji, inexorable and fierce like a dying star, and with a weary practice, he flattens it under his heel.</p>\n<p>After all, he has heard the name Mo Xuanyu before. The young man has a reputation in the cultivation world as a Jin bastard, a lunatic, a demonic cultivator and, perhaps most egregiously, a cut-sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was demonic cultivation,\u201d Lan Wangji says to Sizhui. \u201cI am sure you guessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assumed it was,\u201d Sizhui says with a thoughtful nod. \u201cWell, I hope Mo-qianbei is alright. His family was quite cruel to him, from what we saw.\u201d</p>\n<p>They are shortly interrupted by an unfortunate encounter with Lan Wangji\u2019s least favorite person, and his least favorite person\u2019s nephew. The exchange between the two is mutually venomous \u2014 that is to say, Jiang Wanyin airs out verbal abuse while Lan Wangji maintains an impenetrable silence. He has no words for this man, now or ever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their juniors watch the conversation mutely from the side, as does a young man who Lan Wangji assumes must be the aforementioned Mo Xuanyu. The younger man and his donkey had somehow become embroiled in the inter-sect squabble over spirit nets, and he watches Lan Wangji the entire time with wide eyes. Lan Wangji is far used to being uncomfortably stared at, so he gives the man a cursory nod of acknowledgement, and Mo Xuanyu nods back, then tilts his head and smiles at him, curiously sweet and oddly familiar.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stamps down that old, old feeling again, and heads off with the juniors to finish the hunt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u25c8 \u25c8 \u25c8\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is examining spirit nets when, not long after that unpleasant encounter, he hears the distant rumblings, the far-off screams, that suggest his help may be needed again.</p>\n<p>Hardly a quarter-shichen before, he had split off from the juniors and entrusted them with the ability to finish the night hunt. It should be a simple solve, especially with the Jiang and Jin sects\u2019 involvement, but perhaps there had been an element Lan Wangji had been unaware of. The ground pitches beneath his feet as though from an earthquake, a rumbling that judders through the mountain.</p>\n<p>He abandons the spirit net and begins to walk at a quick pace, heading back to where he had last left Sizhui.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that Lan Wangji hears the flute, a sweet whistling that carries on the mountain wind.</p>\n<p>He freezes in his steps as though paralyzed \u2014 certain, so certain that he must be mistaken. But his ear follows the familiar array of notes, a melody he had only given to one other person in this world \u2014 years and years ago, a different lifetime, a boy holding the boy he loved as they lay dying in a cold prison under the earth, a boy in love holding on to the other until life returned to them.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s heart is running, running, running.</p>\n<p>With a precarious disbelief, he raises one trembling hand. He blinks, blinks twice \u2014 his vision is blurred, prismed by tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares, uncomprehending of the sight after so many years of the same view.</p>\n<p>On Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist, the black string remains, but another has joined alongside it: a thread that is faintly but unmistakably red. It beats as surely as a heart.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns toward the music. His cheeks are wet and he cannot stop shaking. For the first time in thirteen years, the howling inside him falls utterly, utterly silent. There is only the dizi, and that old, old song of his heart.</p>\n<p>With steady steps, Lan Wangji follows the sound until he is home.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<u> <strong>EPILOGUE</strong></u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji wakes, it is from a nightmare.</p>\n<p>This is not unusual for him, but still highly unpleasant.</p>\n<p>He cannot recall the contents, now that he\u2019s awake, as he rarely can. He only knows that Wei Ying had been there; there had been lots of blood; the stitched-up puncture of his grief wound had been howling like a ghost. Usually, those are the three constants of his nightmares, whether he happens to recollect them or not.</p>\n<p>For a long moment, Lan Wangji stares up at the jingshi ceiling, his heart thundering around the acidic, sludgy feeling in his chest. After a moment, he holds up his wrist in the low dawn light, where the red and black threads wrap around his wrist, twins to each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like his scars, he reflects, the black thread is a permanent physical reminder of the loss that preceded this current life of his. While he would, in a heartbeat, take back the years Wei Ying had been gone from the world, he does not regret either of these markings of that period of loss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His xiongzhang, now in seclusion, also carries the black thread as he mourns Jin Guangyao. Perhaps this grief, the weight of this love, is the Lan curse, passed on from father to sons.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Lan Wangji thinks, as he turns to press a sleepy kiss to the top of Wei Ying\u2019s head, his had not lasted.</p>\n<p>It still sometimes feels like a false reality, one precarious breath away from shattering: waking up to Wei Ying tangled up in his arms, or splayed out across his chest and lightly snoring. Right now, Wei Ying is sprawled out naked on top of the covers, the top half of his body a crescent curve toward Lan Wangji. His mouth is slightly ajar, his face slack, lost in a fierce and deep sleep. It is one of Lan Wangji\u2019s favorite assurances, to see Wei Ying resting with such intensity. <strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s sexual preferences tend to veer rougher, as do Lan Wangji\u2019s, and tonight\u2019s everyday had been no exception, perhaps lending to Wei Ying\u2019s deep sleep state. Dark marks from Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth are a scattered purple mottling across Wei Ying\u2019s skin in the low gray light. For a moment, Lan Wangji lies there with a hand to Wei Ying\u2019s hair, observing the perfect slim curve of his waist, the endearing dip of his navel, the soft, dark curve of his cock against his thigh. This new body is slightly different than the one he had initially loved, but as equally beautiful as the previous, simply for the fact that it\u2019s a home to Wei Ying.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji leans down to kiss Wei Ying\u2019s collarbone, and Wei Ying makes a snuffling sound as his lips smack a few times, and then he rolls over to burrow closer into Lan Wangji.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji extricates himself with much difficulty, too restless to lie still anymore. His scars twinge, the tight skin pulling as he shrugs on an outer robe \u2014 they sometimes do first thing in the morning, stiff after the hours of lying still. Some days, he feels them hardly at all, and some days, they are agonizing \u2014 swollen or itchy or tingling, or all at once. Wei Ying never hesitates to offer a massage on the worst of these days, to knead healing ointment or soothing oils into his ridged skin with a gentle and careful attention.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The first time Wei Ying had fucked him \u2014 properly fucked him on his cock, not just with his deft fingers and defter mouth \u2014 he had kissed along the ruined expanse of Lan Wangji\u2019s back, devoting careful attention to each ugly lash. Thirty-three brushstrokes of his mouth while Lan Wangji had rested his forehead on his forearms and shook apart and choked down tears. He couldn\u2019t feel some of the touches, the nerve damage too complete. Lan Wangji had never thought this part of him could be submitted to any form of loving touch; it was almost beyond his imagining. When Wei Ying slid inside him after, he had never felt...more full. More loved, more fiercely joyful to be alive.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you would hate them,\u201d Lan Wangji had murmured to Wei Ying, in the flushed and breathless after. He doesn\u2019t simply mean their appearance, but their meaning. <strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you know me, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying had said, a hand floating up to brush hair off of Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead. \u201cI think scars are hot.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Then, to Lan Wangji\u2019s wry huff of laughter, more seriously, with a thumb fitted to the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth: \u201cI\u2019m in love with every part of you.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>An autumn chill has settled across the jingshi like a cold dew. Lan Wangji moves another log on the fire, then crosses back to the bed to wrap Wei Ying in blankets more securely. Wei Ying snuffs, shifts a little, but otherwise doesn\u2019t stir, his mouth still fallen open.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slips out to the front porch, leaving the jingshi\u2019s sliding door open a crack behind him. There, he silently inhales, watches his breath leave him in a thin cloud. He lets the cold settle into the deepest places of his lungs as the world slowly rustles awake around him. <strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The flowers he and Wei Ying had gardened over the summer have started to die from the early frosts, but the lotus pond that they have painstakingly cultivated is in proper season. Soon, there will be seeds to harvest, to shell and to feed each other with their hands. Soon, the mountain winter will slither in from the north and freeze the pond solid, and then the spring rains will thaw it, and then summer will return again, where Wei Ying will roll up his trousers and stick his feet into the cool muddy water and beam at Lan Wangji on the porch with a sunlit and carefree joy. It is all ahead of them.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Suddenly there\u2019s a press of warmth against his back, two arms slipping around his waist to hug his front. Wei Ying hooks his chin onto Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, sighing sleepily into his neck.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes and murmurs, \u201cIt is early,\u201d even as his own arms drift up to hug Wei Ying\u2019s closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot tired,\u201d Wei Ying says around an obvious yawn, the pop of his jawbone against Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWanna spend the morning with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rubs his thumbs in circles on Wei Ying\u2019s hands. \u201cYou should sleep, love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m all good, I promise,\u201d Wei Ying says stubbornly, and kisses the side of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat good is a bed without Lan Zhan in it, anyway?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a long time, they remain silent in this position, swaying lightly in place as ashen light breaks apart into color over the mountain. It\u2019s possible Wei Ying has fallen asleep standing up, but his body warmth is a welcome shield against the dawn chill.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs into his skin. Ah, so he is awake. \u201cYou know how much I love you, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A thick emotion gathers in Lan Wangji\u2019s throat. Wei Ying has said it countless times by now, since that first time in Guanyin Temple \u2014 he has shown it in countless ways, in countless contexts, spoken and unspoken, but each time seems to flatten him anew.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, suddenly afraid to say more.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well, it bears repeating,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cSo: I love you, I love you, I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji brings Wei Ying\u2019s knuckles up to his mouth to brush his lips against them before he turns and buries his cold nose into Wei Ying\u2019s neck. Since they married three years ago, they are often open with physical affection like this, but Lan Wangji is not usually so demonstratively...demanding about it. Wei Ying takes the cue as though nothing is unusual, bundling him up tight in his arms and breathing out a contented little sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again, they remain like this for some time, until the rising sun grows warm against Lan Wangji\u2019s back, the taut skin around his scars untensing. Wei Ying breathes into his hair with his eyes closed, then after another long moment, kisses Lan Wangji\u2019s temple.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fight whatever is in your dreams,\u201d he says, so serious and threatening about it that it almost startles a puff of laughter from Lan Wangji. \u201cI mean it. I can find a way.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill not be necessary,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and then, for the sole purpose of flustering his husband, finishes, \u201cWei Ying is in my dreams.\u201d<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cSweet talker,\u201d Wei Ying grumbles even as he pinks and hugs Lan Wangji tighter. \u201cAnd anyway, you say that as if I wouldn\u2019t fight myself.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough two Wei Yings fighting each other probably <em> would </em>be a certain dream of Hanguang-jun\u2019s, eh?\u201d Wei Ying teases, apparently awake enough to flirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lightly thumps Wei Ying\u2019s back but doesn\u2019t deny it, warming into the sound of Wei Ying\u2019s delighted laughter against his ear. To think he had ever gone without it, and for so long, is unfathomable; it feels like a life that happened to someone else.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>But <em> this </em> is his life, now. His and Wei Ying\u2019s \u2014\u00a0as it was always meant to be, since the day the red thread first appeared on their wrists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks they deserve it, after everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, sweetheart,\u201d Wei Ying says with a sleepy sound, and pulls Lan Wangji back toward the jingshi with a tug of their thread. It catches the dawn light as fervidly as a lit coal. \u201cLet\u2019s get ready for the day, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Softly, Lan Wangji says, \u201cOkay,\u201d and he tugs back. After another moment, he follows Wei Ying inside.</p>"
