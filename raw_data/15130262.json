  "text": "<p>Tony doesn\u2019t often get calls from Peter Parker. Even though Peter has his number, it\u2019s an \u201cemergencies only\u201d type of situation; he still gives his general updates to Happy. Tony\u2019s usually the one to reach out to Peter, either to try and convince himself he\u2019s being a half decent vigilante babysitter or to invite the kid up to the labs. </p>\n<p>So when he gets a call from Peter at 2:43 in the morning on a Friday night, he\u2019s hit with a wave of panic.</p>\n<p>Pepper looks up sleepily from beside him as he snatches up his phone and swings his legs out of bed. She rolls her eyes and blows him a kiss before settling back down into the pillows. Tony barely sees her, he\u2019s so busy trying to get his shaking hands to answer the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dead are you?\u201d he asks as a way of greeting, trying to keep the panic in his voice to a subtle undertone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmigod, so dead,\u201d Peter says, sounding just as riled up as Tony feels.</p>\n<p>Tony is out of bed in an instant, the suit half on as he stumbles on to the balcony. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, just hold on, how badly are you\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d says Peter. \u201cI\u2019m not actually dead, it\u2019s an expression. I\u2019m not even patrolling right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stops, his leg halfway slung over the railing of his balcony. The suit is fully on, and his heart is beating ten miles a minute.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something people say,\u201d Peter says, sounding mildly abashed at the cold fury in Tony\u2019s voice. \u201cLike if you see a funny vine, or a viral video of adorable puppies sneezing, you say, \u2018I\u2019m so dead.\u2019 You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony half falls back onto the deck, his suit dismantling around him. The panic in his brain is dulling. His heart is slowing down. Tony\u2019s fairly sure when he looks in the mirror tomorrow, all his hair will be gray. This fucking kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not dead,\u201d Tony says harshly, \u201cOr in the middle of dying a gruesome, bloody death, why have you decided to grace me with your voice at three in the morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just saw the video!\u201d Peter exclaims, his voice slightly panicked. \u201cNed sent it to me at eleven, but I didn\u2019t get home until ten minutes ago so I couldn\u2019t watch it, and\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Tony says, holding up a hand. \u201cPause. You were out patrolling until two thirty at night? Didn\u2019t you\u2019re aunt set a curfew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s negotiable,\u201d Peter says. \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t want me to go behind her back, I think. Anyway, Ned sent me this video\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really interested in the GIFs teenage boys send each other in the wee hours of morning,\u201d Tony says grouchily, watching the suit fold back up into a portable sized square and shoving it in his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, Falcon name dropped me in an interview,\u201d Peter interrupts, his voice an octave higher than normal.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s heart freezes for the second time in the last five minutes. \u201cAnd by name dropped, you mean . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he namedropped Spiderman,\u201d amends Peter. \u201cBut not in a cool, yeah, I met him once, kind of way. He said I was a little asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Tony can\u2019t resist saying.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d says Peter, his voice dangerously close to a whine. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right, sorry,\u201d says Tony, settling back into bed besides Pepper. She frowns at the phone and mouths: everything okay? Tony nods and waves her down. \u201cWhat was the context?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess some security footage was leaked of the fight in Germany,\u201d Peter says. \u201cSome of the footage showed me, like, webbing him and the dude with the badass metal arm to the ground. The interviewer was all like, looking back on it, do you think you could\u2019ve taken him down if you had tried harder? And the falcon totally dissed me, said he was pulling his punches, and called me a little asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Tony mildly, putting Peter on speaker so he can page through Youtube to find the video. \u201cIn his defense, I\u2019m sure the footage didn\u2019t make him look to great. He got taken down by someone whose resume mainly included getting cats out of trees.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tony realizes after he says it how much pride leaked into his voice, and he resolves to be extra distant for the rest of the phone call.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you\u2019d be surprised by how hard it is to deal with cats that don\u2019t want to be saved,\u201d Peter says indignantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you right there, kid,\u201d Tony says, stifling a yawn behind his hand. \u201cWhy do you care what Sam told some interviewer from god-knows-where he\u2019s hiding out? No one cares what he thinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates. </p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s stupid,\u201d he says finally.</p>\n<p>Great. Now Tony feels like an asshole. He takes a deep breath and reminds himself that Peter isn\u2019t used to having negative press. Most of the local newspapers in New York love him; hell, he gets more good PR helping old ladies cross the street than Tony gets from denuclearizing part of North Korea. Everyone loves Peter Parker, but the first time an Avenger publically talks about him he gets called a little asshole? That\u2019s bullshit. Sam is going down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIf it pisses you off, do something about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony says breezily. \u201cPost the leaked footage of you kicking his ass on Spiderman\u2019s Instagram page. Don\u2019t you have, like, thirty followers? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have almost eight thousand,\u201d Peter says proudly. \u201cBut MJ manages that account for me, and there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll let me screw up the aesthetic.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWho\u2019s MJ?\u201d Tony decides not to ask about the \u201caesthetic.\u201d He gets the feeling he doesn\u2019t want to know.</p>\n<p>Peter takes a second to respond. \u201cJust a girl from school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to tell anyone you\u2019re little secret,\u201d Tony says crossly. Alright, fine. He\u2019s annoyed he hasn\u2019t heard about this kid\u2019s girl before. It\u2019s not like he sees Peter often, maybe once every two weeks to tinker around in the lab together. But he would\u2019ve thought he knew about all of the kid\u2019s friends. So yeah, it\u2019s a little annoying he\u2019s never heard about this MJ character.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, that\u2019s not the point,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThe point is that everyone who watches the interview is going to think I\u2019m an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper frowns at Tony, gesturing for him to let her sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo submit a formal complaint,\u201d Tony says quietly. \u201cPublish a video of you throwing shade. I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re a smart kid. Figure out how to get back at him.\u201d </p>\n<p>In Tony\u2019s defense, he gives terrible advice. Most people know better than to follow it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The footage is shaky.</p>\n<p>Spiderman sits in front of a table, mask on, with all of the Avengers action figures spread in front of him. The camera, held by Ned, focuses in on the figures one by one before coming to rest on Spiderman.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Peter says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m your friendly neighborhood Spiderman, video credits to my guy in the chair. As you can see, I have the Avengers spread out before me, and I\u2019m here to assemble the A-team.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with Iron Man,\u201d Peter says happily, carefully setting the figurine in the center of the table. \u201cHe definitely makes the A-team, ten out of ten, would definitely recommend. I\u2019ve met him on, like, six different occasions, and every time I see him I\u2019m still like, ohmigodit\u2019stonystark, ican\u2019teven. He\u2019s, like, the best of the best. Definitely my favorite Avenger, no competition, he\u2019s team captain. </p>\n<p>Humming to himself, Peter set Spiderman next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put the Scarlet Witch over here,\u201d he says absently, setting down Wanda\u2019s figurine far away from the center. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love her and her powers are badass, but the girl I like told me she\u2019d leave me for the Scarlet Witch without a second thought, so. Just going to keep her far away for a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was there, and I can confirm that she was not joking,\u201d says Ned helpfully from behind the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce Banner can be on Spiderman\u2019s A-team, obviously,\u201d says Peter, putting the hulk figurine next to Iron Man. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit in love with him, oh my god. I\u2019ve legit read all his papers on the long term effects of Gamma Radiation and how it could possibly be used to cure cancer. He\u2019s, like, my science hero, I would sell both my kidneys on the black market for a thirty second conversation with him.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDoes Thor make the A-team?\u201d asks Ned, his voice muffled from behind the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d says Peter, carefully putting him besides Iron Man. \u201cI\u2019m almost glad I\u2019ve never met him, because I\u2019d die. Like, my poor fanboy head would explode and I\u2019d die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all might think he\u2019s exaggerating,\u201d Ned\u2019s voice echoes though the footage from the background. \u201cHe\u2019s not. He\u2019s, like, super gay for Thor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone is super gay for Thor,\u201d Peter says indignantly. \u201cThe only way someone could not be gay for Thor is if they\u2019re straight for him. Or somewhere in between, for our NB friends. Those are, like, the only options.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned snorted.\nAn evil smile spreads over Peter\u2019s face underneath the mask.</p>\n<p> \u201cI beat your ass,\u201d Peter says dismissively, smacking the falcon figurine away from the center of the table. \u201cYou can sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks into the camera, the eye slits of the suit narrowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s the little asshole now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>11,000,0098 views<br>\n9,998,128 hits</p>\n<p>Ironfangirl101<br>\nThis is the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen.

That part had me roflmao</p>\n<p>Friendly.neighborhood.spider.fan<br>\nI\u2019ve found my future husband.</p>\n<p>Overnight, Spiderman explodes.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there are half a dozen Spiderwatch pages on the internet, tracking his every move. Stark Industries is offered half a million dollars cumulatively by various news outlets, all trying to get an ID on the vigilante. Less than six hours after the video is posted, Spiderman\u2019s Instagram page has gained 5.4 million followers. The videos of him catching busses and rescuing cats are suddenly trending.</p>\n<p>Happy watches the video once, lets out a stream of expletives, and takes the rest of the week off. Pepper informs Tony that they will be hosting an emergency press conference. Tony locks himself in his lab, watches the video on endless repeat for six hours, and drinks seventeen cups of coffee.</p>\n<p>This. Fucking. Kid.</p>\n<p>Tony can see instantly why the video went viral. It\u2019s everything the public wants: a young, open minded, adorable superhero playing with toys and pissing all over public enemies. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the video humanizes some of the most dangerous people on earth. </p>\n<p>The hashtags #gayforthor, #spiderfan, and #youcansitdown are all trending on various social media platforms. There\u2019s even a meme of Wanda that has gone viral. Someone had taken a selfie that she\u2019d posted on her Instagram and captioned it: \u2018The most attractive feature in male superheroes? Their girlfriends.\u2019 </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m going to put the Scarlet Witch over here. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love her and her powers are badass, but the girl I like told me she\u2019d leave me for the Scarlet Witch without a second thought, so. Just going to keep her far away for a little while.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, Parker,\u201d mutters Tony in sardonic, sleep deprived disgust. \u201cAnd you\u2019re aunt said you were good at making friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>At least Peter has had the common sense to keep his head down. Tony\u2019s fairly sure half of the population in Queens is out and about, phones ready to capture any movement from the vigilante.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLet\u2019s start with Iron Man. He definitely makes the A-team, ten out of ten, would definitely recommend. I\u2019ve met him on, like, six different occasions, and every time I see him I\u2019m still like, ohmigodit\u2019stonystark, ican\u2019teven. He\u2019s, like, the best of the best. Definitely my favorite Avenger, no competition, he\u2019s team captain.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn strait,\u201d mumbles Tony. God, it\u2019s so hard to be pissed at that freaking kid.</p>\n<p>Rhodey shows up and overrides Tony\u2019s lab codes about halfway through Tony\u2019s nineteenth cup of coffee. His mechanical legs whir happily as he makes his way over to Tony, peering over his hunched shoulders at the video playing on the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rhodey says flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s not the weirdest thing I\u2019ve walked in on you watching.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a noise somewhere between a moan and a grunt and buries his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m actually kind of hurt,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even mention me in his dumb video. Which has almost twelve million views, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him to make it,\u201d says Tony, his voice muffled by his hands. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he just do what everyone else does and ignore my advice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was mostly joking,\u201d Tony gripes. \u201cSam called him a little asshole during an interview, and I told him to make a video to get back at him. This wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind. I was thinking more along the lines of a diss-track. Something harder to trace back to Spiderman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to get in front of this,\u201d says Rhodey. \u201cTony, Ross has called me three times today to try to get me to identify him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks up quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Tony, would you relax? You know I love the kid as much as you do,\u201d Rhodey says indignantly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give him to Ross. You know me better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony downs the rest of his coffee in a single sip.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you talked to him yet?\u201d asks Rhodey.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d snaps Tony. \u201cHey, kid, have you gotten any publicity lately?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cTony, however freaked out you are by this mess, I guarantee you, he\u2019s probably feeling a whole lot worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>The kid picks up on the first ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Peter says, trying very hard to sound nonchalant. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Mr. Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Thor\u2019s not really all that once you look past the muscles and the hair and the gorgeous facial features and the charming personality,\u201d Tony tells Peter coolly. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a slight pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Peter, his tone unconvincingly casual. \u201cYou saw the video.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich video are we referring to,\u201d asks Tony coldly, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cThe one that turned you into an overnight internet celebrity, or is there another one I don\u2019t know about? You\u2019re the one who said you wanted to stay on the down low, Parker\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to go viral!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen what exactly did you\u2014,\u201d Tony takes a deep breath and reminds himself to calm down. This isn\u2019t Peter\u2019s fault. If anything, it\u2019s on him. \u201cOkay, look. Provided that Sam doesn\u2019t track you down and murder you\u2014.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLang\u2014,\u201d Tony cuts himself off before he sounds any more like a helicopter parent. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s pissed at you, and he has every right to be. You dissed him in front of ten million people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my defense,\u201d Peter says quickly. \u201cHe started it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he started it, did he? Is there any version of this where you don\u2019t sound like a five year old?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter says, annoyance in his voice. \u201cIs there any version of this where you don\u2019t sound like . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off, perhaps remembering who he\u2019s talking to. Good. Let the kid stew in that for a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Tony says icily, ignoring the awkward silence. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Peter says, and there\u2019s genuine fear in his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t be a friendly, neighborhood Spiderman if everyone in New York knows who I am. There are fan accounts trying to figure out my identity, Tony. It\u2019s like, a huge invasion of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony wants to say: <em>You should have thought about that before you posted the video.</em> He wants to say: Welcome to the major leagues.

This will all die down in a few days. Don\u2019t worry, Pete.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p> It doesn\u2019t die down.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The video is posted on YouTube ten hours later.</p>\n<p>Wanda is sitting in front of a metal table, Avengers figurines spread out in front of her. Her eyes glint maliciously in the bright lights as she smiles at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cShuri has just informed me,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cThat I have been excluded from a certain A-Team. This is shemshno. Ridiculous. To defend my honor, I will be making my own A-Team, one that only contains the best of the best. The cream of the crop. My team will be called \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438, or Supreme Heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smiling happily, she picks up the Wanda Maximoff figurine and put it in the center of the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d she says. \u201cTeam captain. Boom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNatasha will be my number two,\u201d she adds, moving the spy next to her. \u201cI think she felt a little left out after she was excluded from Spiderman\u2019s video. She was unable to join me here, today, but I have no doubt she will make her feelings known the next time we come into contact with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClint is also welcome to join the \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438,\u201d Wanda continues, moving the archer next to Natasha. \u201cHe says he is retired, but he has retired four times in the past six years, so I\u2019m willing to bet we can talk him into joining, no?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBest of friends, best of friends,\u201d Wanda hums, moving the Iron Man and Captain America figurines to the center of the table. </p>\n<p>Her fingers wrap around the Spiderman figurine, and she smiles into the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpiderman,\u201d she says softly. \u201cYou were a little mean to Sam, don\u2019t you know? I think you hurt his feelings. I\u2019ve never seen him sulk so much. And as for me, I have never been so . . . harassed, on the online world. You made me into a, a meme. So, so many people . . . how to say . . . spammed? They spammed my Instagram, practically begging me to take this challenge.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI will let you join my team, even if you did not let me join yours,\u201d Wanda says. \u201cBecause I am a nice person. But you owe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wanda looks into the camera, and her smile grows wider.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m ever single, tell your girlfriend to hit me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vision.official<br>\nThank you so much for generously inviting me to be on your A-team.<br>\n(3.4 million like this comment.)</p>\n<p>wanda.witch<br>\nSorry.

You\u2019re the one who said you wanted to <em>\u2018stay on the DL, protect the little guy.\u2019</em> Teaming up with war criminals\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got them pardoned,\u201d Peter says reasonably. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like I betrayed you and hung out with Captain America.\u201d</p>\n<p>That stings enough that Tony has to set down the phone and close his eyes for a second. Because, Jesus, he knows how much the kid looks up to Rogers. Tony sees it in his eyes every time Captain America comes up in conversation. Whatever issues Tony might have with Rogers, he doesn\u2019t want to be the guy who corrupts Peter.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and picks the phone back up, looking at Rhodey for help. Rhodey crunches down on a potato chip, looking amused.</p>\n<p>Tony decides to try a different tactic. \u201cDo you have any idea how dangerous Wanda Maximoff is?\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silence on the other end of the phone. Rhodey rolls his eyes at Tony. He\u2019s spent the morning mouthing <em>helicopter parent</em> behind Tony\u2019s back as he griped, moaned, complained, and finally called Peter.</p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s this picture that\u2019s circulating the internet. Spiderman and Scarlet Witch, back to back, in admittedly badass poses, taking down six hydra agents in a backstreet ally in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Tony was less than thrilled when he saw it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re dangerous,\u201d Peter says mildly. \u201cI\u2019m dangerous. MJ says the only reason Scarlet Witch gets such negative press is because she\u2019s a powerful girl. Like, it\u2019s okay for Dr. Banner to destroy buildings because he\u2019s a privileged white man, but the second that Wanda\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s \u2018Wanda\u2019 now?\u201d asks Tony. \u201cYou\u2019re on a first name basis with her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d says Peter, pride leaking into his voice. \u201cWe did take down a hydra cartel together. And she called me, by the way, not the other way around. Well, actually she DM\u2019d me, but\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Tony says, his voice somewhere between a frustrated snarl and a desperate plea. \u201cWhat happened to keeping your head down and sticking up for the little guy?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m still looking out for the little guy,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to change. Today, I went and got a kid\u2019s stuffed animal that he left on the subway. I also helped an old lady cross the street, and she gave me a sticker that she\u2019d been saving for her granddaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Tony says, his voice getting dangerously close to a yell. \u201cI read about it on fifteen different blogs!\u201d </p>\n<p>Rhodey sniggers, but by the time Tony whirls around, his face is a mask of polite concern. <em>I\u2019m disowning you</em>, Tony mouths at him.</p>\n<p>Tony knew it was only a matter of time before everyone realized Spiderman\u2019s value. Hell, he spent fifteen minutes reading a Vogue article titled <em>Virtuous Vigilante: Top Ten Reasons why Spiderman is the Best Avenger</em>. He just wishes that Peter had waited to go viral until he was ready for the shitty world of fame. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Peter, worry in his voice. \u201cI swear, I\u2019m not letting this go to my head at all. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about it, right? So I might as well make the best of this . . . unexpected situation. And if Scarlet Witch wants to team up every now and then, who am I to say no?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried she\u2019ll steal your girlfriend?\u201d Tony says snidely. \u201cHey, while we\u2019re on that subject, how long have you had a girlfriend? And why didn\u2019t I know about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey cackles loudly, apparently no longer able to contain himself. Tony shushes him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Peter moans. \u201cThis is, like, so not a conversation I want to have right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a conversation the entire online world is having.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but she\u2019s not really my girlfriend,\u201d says Peter. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not official or anything. The internet twisted it way out of proportion, you know? She knows I like her, but it\u2019s confusing. Sometimes she acts\nlike she\u2019s interested in me, but then sometimes she acts like my very existence offends her, so\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cForget it. I don\u2019t want to know. There\u2019s a long, long list of topics that we should agree to never talk about. Let\u2019s make this one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked,\u201d says Peter. Then, after a pause, he adds, \u201cDid you see that Captain America and Sam Wilson took the A-Team challenge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sits bold upright. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s trending number one,\u201d says Peter gleefully. \u201cI mean sure, the Falcon threw some shade. But Captain Freaking America said I have heart, so\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo spoilers!\u201d Tony says quickly, pulling the video up on his tablet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you been doing all morning?\u201d demands Peter. \u201cHow could you not have known?\u201d</p>\n<p>In all honesty, Tony had spent the morning ranting to Rhodey about the aforementioned Peter Parker/Wanda Maximoff debacle. But Peter didn\u2019t have to know that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI slept in,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cRhodey, get over here. I get the feeling we\u2019re both going to want to see this.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>Steve and Sam sit side by side in front of a wooden table. From the backdrop, it seems like they\u2019re holed up in an apartment somewhere. The Avengers figurines, spread out in front of them, look like they\u2019re brand new.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Sam says, grinning at the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re here to get back at the little shit who started this whole thing . . . I mean, take the A-team challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gives him a disapproving look. \u201cIn my opinion, anyone who cares about saving lives is worthy of being an Avenger, and any Avenger is worthy of being on the A-team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d says Sam cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re the kind of people who like to have the last word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d says Steve, slightly irritated. \u201cWe take the high road and\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSave it for the PSAs,\u201d Sam says. \u201cFirst off, us.\u201d He set the Captain America and Falcon figurines in the center of the table. \u201cI know it\u2019s traditional to elect a team captain right off the bat, so we can be co-captains.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looks amused. \u201cI\u2019m willing to just be America if you want to change your name to Captain Falcon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Falcon shushes him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNat, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cShe gets salty when she gets left out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t poker,\u201d Steve says, barely holding down a laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t just decide who makes the cut and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s literally the whole point of this challenge,\u201d Sam argues. \u201cNext, we have Wanda. She didn\u2019t name drop me in her video, but whatever. Guess I\u2019m not good enough for\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you please let that go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVision,\u201d Sam says, setting the figurine next to Natasha. \u201cI don\u2019t understand about ninety percent of what he says, but he\u2019s a cool dude. Thor can be on the A-team, too. Good guy, good guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Bucky?\u201d asks Steve, holding up the Winter Soldier figurine and twisting his arm around in a circle, looking intrigued.</p>\n<p>Sam wrinkles his nose in disgust. \u201cWhat, do you want to be co-captains with him instead? Fine, be my guest. See if I care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Are you really jealous right now? Because-,\"</p>\n<p>\"T'Challa probably won't want to be on our A-team; he has his own shit going on,\" says Sam. \"But the invite is always open, my man.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI want Tony on our A-team, too,\u201d says Steve quietly, looking into the camera. \u201cNo matter what goes down, I always feel safer when we have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, we can\u2019t let everyone on our A-team, or it defeats the purpose,\u201d Sam says. </p>\n<p>\u201cBruce, too,\u201d says Steve, beginning to get into it. \u201cAnd Clint, of course. And Rhodey. And Scott. Where\u2019s Scott? I can\u2019t find his action figure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find one,\u201d says Sam through gritted teeth. \u201cI had, like, twenty minutes to shop before Walmart closed. Besides, do you know how much these things cost?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very realistic, either,\u201d says Steve, staring perplexedly at the Captain America figurine. \u201cAre my eyes really that far apart?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam ignored him, instead picking up the last remaining figurine and grinning gleefully at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpiderman,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, what a little asshole. I stand by it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Steve grins. \u201cThe kid\u2019s got heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPizzazz and heart aren\u2019t the same thing,\u201d says Sam crossly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make the A-team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam,\u201d says Steve pleadingly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell people they don\u2019t make your A-team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly. . .\u201d Sam pauses. \u201cDo you understand what we\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Avengers don\u2019t discriminate,\u201d says Steve firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Sam grumbles. \u201cI should\u2019ve asked Nat to do this with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Natasha\u2019s voice echoes from off screen. \u201cI said no.\u201d</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d says Rhodey. \u201cThat was . . . oddly sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony scrolls through the comments on the video, more and more irritated by the second. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Steve\u2019s been getting bad PR since he went rogue and went against what the people wanted,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWhy is everyone so happy with him at the moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s giving the people what they want,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSure, he\u2019s not selling away his basic human rights, but he made a cute video with his best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Steve Rogers is officially my favorite Avenger again . . . please marry me</em>?\u201d reads Tony in outrage. \u201cNo, no. Forget this. I\u2019m calling Peter and telling him to bring his toys over here ASAP. We\u2019re taking this stupid challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything about the video screams quality, from the lighting to the backdrop to the fancy metal table. Tony Stark is sitting in between Spiderman and a disgruntled looking Rhodey, smirking at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Tony says smugly, gesturing grandly to the figurines spread out before him. \u201cIt\u2019s been brought to my attention that I have not taken a certain challenge patented by our arachnid friend sitting to my left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s literally only doing this because he\u2019s pissed that Steve\u2019s getting good PR,\u201d Rhodey says sullenly from beside him. \u201cYou\u2019re not fooling anyone, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d says Tony. \u201cThe A-team challenge was created as a way for Avengers to show their appreciation for their fellow teammates\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Spiderman cheerfully from beside him. \u201cYou told me to make a video to get back at Falcon for calling me a little asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t quite remember the details,\u201d says Tony shortly. He picks up the Iron Man figurine and eyes it, looking annoyed. \u201cThis toy is trash, by the way. My armor is a blend of aluminum and iron and is layered to optimize protection and control. This is literally plastic painted yellow and gold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spiderman snatches away the figurine. \u201cI bought it for like, five dollars on eBay, alright? Stop judging.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony rolls his eyes and takes the figurine back, setting it in the center of the table. \u201cFine. Whatever. I\u2019m team captain, obviously\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were all Team Iron Man,\u201d says Spiderman smarmily. \u201cSomething you want to tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony fixes him with a glare. The little shit. \u201cWatch it, or I\u2019m grounding you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m benching Rhodey for the indefinite future,\u201d says Tony, setting the Iron Patriot figurine aside. \u201cNo crime fighting for you until your legs have completely healed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Tony,\u201d says Rhodey, outraged. \u201cYou literally took down an army of robots while dying from blood poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRecovering from blood poisoning,\u201d Tony corrects. \u201cYou\u2019re benched, Rhodey, don\u2019t fight me on this. It\u2019s because I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike hell\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoint Break,\u201d says Tony, picking up the Thor figurine. \u201cYeah, no, screw him. Overrated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThor is not overrated!\u201d says Spiderman hotly. \u201cHe\u2019s fabulous. He\u2019s literally the best\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be very careful about how you finish that sentence, Underoos, you might hurt my feelings,\u201d says Tony dryly. \u201cI\u2019d let Brucey be on my A-team, except for he\u2019s vanished off the face of the earth, so it\u2019s a no go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony swats the hulk figurine off the table. \u201cWho has abandonment issues now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d says Rhodey dryly at the same time as Peter squeaks, \u201c<em>Be careful with that</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNatasha can sit over here,\u201d says Tony, moving her far away from the center of the table. \u201cTake away her instincts, years of experience, and superspy training, and she wouldn\u2019t even be an Avenger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Rhodey and Spiderman immediately launch into protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take away everything that makes her Natasha, and then just\u2014,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s the Black Widow,\u201d says Peter desperately. \u201cMr. Stark, the <em>Black Widow</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBird Man can chill on the floor with Bruce,\u201d says Tony, flicking Sam\u2019s figurine off the table. \u201cUnderoos took you down embarrassingly easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spiderman flashes a peace sign at the camera. \u201cRIP.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd as for America\u2019s sweetheart . . . well, someone needs to lock Capcicle back in a walk in freezer,\u201d Tony says snidely. \u201cI mean, Jesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a smooth motion, he brushed the remaining figurines off the table, leaving the Iron Man figurine alone in the center. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe A-team,\u201d says Tony proudly, gesturing to the lone Iron Man figurine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really, really sad,\u201d says Rhodey. \u201cLike, this is making me depressed. Look Spiderman in the eyes and tell him he can\u2019t be on your A-team.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up hopefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Uh uh. Not going to happen,\u201d says Tony quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look, Underoos. You\u2019re on the JV squad until you graduate from college.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a batch of cookies,\u201d offers Peter. \u201cThe good kind. Chocolate chip, with marshmallows and skittles and six cups of sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey and Tony stare at him, looks of horror creeping across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really, really disgusting,\u201d says Rhodey.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to have a heart attack? And/or diabetes?\u201d demands Tony. \u201cJesus, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually really good,\u201d says Peter. \u201cDo we have a deal? I\u2019ll make you cookies, and you\u2019ll let me on your A-team?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Tony incredulously. \u201cHow about this for a deal. You <em>make healthy dietary choices</em>, stay in school, and don\u2019t engage in any dangerous superhero activities, and I\u2019ll try to keep from going grey because of all the stress you put me through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, is Tony Stark encouraging good behavior, or am I having a stroke?\u201d asks Rhodey. \u201cKid, tell Tony he\u2019s being a helicopter parent and he needs to reevaluate his life choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Rhodes,\u201d says Spiderman, eyes narrowing cheekily at the camera. \u201cMr. Stark isn\u2019t like a regular mom, he\u2019s a cool mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just quote Mean Girls at me?\u201d Tony fumes. \u201cYou know what, Team Captain can have you, Team Iron Man is officially disowning you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just understand a Mean Girls reference?\u201d asks Spiderman innocently.</p>\n<p>Tony stares at Spiderman for a second, completely silently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d he says finally. \u201cThis is over. Goodbye.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands up, put on his shades, and stalks out of the camera angle. \u201cThis fucking kid,\u201d echoes across the screen from the place he disappeared.</p>\n<p>Immediately, Spiderman dives onto the floor, scooping up the Spiderman figurine and setting it next to the Iron Man one on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeam Iron Man,\u201d he says cheerfully, and the footage fades to black.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>nat.attack<br>\nWow thanks @tonystark tell me how you really feel<br>\n(20.4 million like this comment)</p>\n<p>wanda.witch<br>\nAfter everything that has happened between us, you let Tony shove me off the table?

Even though, sure, he knew there was a possibility he might run into them sooner or later, it was easier for him to pretend they were still hiding out in remote Africa. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s known they\u2019ve been back in the states for about two weeks now\u2014god, that was a PR nightmare. He didn\u2019t interfere with negotiations too much, mostly just to piss off Ross, but he\u2019s kept tabs on them. He\u2019s called in a few favors and talked to presidents of foreign countries. He made sure they\u2019ve had accommodations that didn\u2019t include Wanda being forced into a straightjacket like an animal.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not like Tony doesn\u2019t appreciate help with the whole alien thing\u2014he does. Rhodey is getting his ass kicked trying to secure a perimeter, and Tony isn\u2019t faring much better in the air. He\u2019s so focused on keeping a giant alien marshmallow thingy from eating the statue of liberty that he doesn\u2019t really have time to help anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not entirely surprised when Friday alerts him of an unknown caller. He suspected Steve and his ragtag band of misfits might be stopping by to stay hello. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s happy about it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s perfectly fine being his own A-team.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Friday,\u201d Tony sighs, aiming a blaster at the giant alien marshmallow cloud. \u201cPut him through.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, and then a single word. \u201cTony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t Captain Spandex,\u201d Tony drawls, trying to act like he\u2019s draped across a leather chair with a glass of scotch, as opposed to fighting a giant alien marshmallow cloud that just consumed part of the Statue of Liberty\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d the Captain says, and goddamn it if Tony doesn\u2019t want to hang up on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, me and Rhodey have it covered,\u201d Tony says. \u201cThat\u2019s why part of the city is in flames. Here all that noise? That\u2019s the sound of peaceful harmony, Rogers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have comms,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cWant me to patch you in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony says. \u201cFriday, will you be a dear and hack into our beloved Captains communications systems?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Friday says.</p>\n<p>He hears an exasperated huff from Rogers, but he doesn\u2019t really give a crap if he pissed on anyone\u2019s feelings, so he terminates the call and waits for Friday to patch him in.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s shitty tech, in any case. It only takes Friday 20 seconds to hack into their systems and reroute Tony through everyone\u2019s comms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are my favorite criminals?\u201d Tony asks. In his defense, he keeps the vast majority of the bitterness he\u2019s feeling out of his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d greets Natasha, \u201cGood to hear from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asks coolly, as he avoids a flying chunk of Lady Liberty\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have eyes up high,\u201d he hears Sam\u2019s voice cut in. \u201cNatasha and Clint are securing a perimeter. Everyone else is either on damage control or alien destruction duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the Captain\u2019s most formal plan,\u201d Tony observes. He engages his thrusters and manages to get a good hit on the underbelly of whatever the giant alien marshmallow thingy is.</p>\n<p>The Captain sounds amused rather than annoyed when he responds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of time for brainstorming.\u201d</p>\n<p>The marshmallow explodes into chunks of fiery s\u2019more. Tony curses as a glob hits the suit. Judging by the way the metal hisses before he flicks it off, it isn\u2019t actually a marshmallow he was fighting. Surprise surprise.</p>\n<p>Tony turns around midair to assess the state of the city. It\u2019s would be a nice view, if it weren\u2019t for all the carnage and destruction. He catches his first sight of Steve, and his stomach churns. Blue and red stripes have been replaced by black cloth. How the times change.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice makeover, Cap,\u201d Tony says, and he can\u2019t keep the bite out of his voice. \u201cHey, do you have any homicidal, one-armed friends lurking around that I should be aware of? I don\u2019t like to be caught off guard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky\u2019s not here,\u201d Steve says shortly. Tony watches him pound an alien with a shield for a few seconds before he turns away.</p>\n<p>Almost instantly, he catches a hint of blue and red between two buildings, approaching the eye of the storm at a rapid rate. Tony narrows his eyes in confusion, glancing back at the Captain, who is still decidedly not wearing any patriotic colors.</p>\n<p>Then it hits him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he growls.</p>\n<p>Immediately he\u2019s hit by a barrage of, \u201cWhat happened, everything okay?\u201d but he\u2019s too busy calling Peter goddamn Parker to answer anyone.</p>\n<p>Peter picks up on the second ring. \u201cHey Mr. Stark,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m kind of hurt that you threw a party and didn\u2019t invite me. I\u2019m on your A-team, remember? I thought we were friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are most decidedly not friends,\u201d Tony says. \u201cReal friends don\u2019t skip school when they\u2019re explicitly told to stay where they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t . . . what\u2019s going on?\u201d Steve asks. There\u2019s genuine confusion in his voice, which makes Tony want to laugh. \u201cTony, who are you talking to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Tony snaps at the captain. Peter makes a confused noise, and Tony pinches the bridge of his mask with two iron fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, this is stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not having two conversations at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there someone you can hear that we can\u2019t, Tony?\u201d Clint quips. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the kind of thing you should deal with in therapy, not during an alien invasion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aaaaaaand Tony\u2019s had enough. \u201cPrototype 396, could you please patch Underoos through to our unofficial group chat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Karen,\u201d Prototype 396 tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter Plankton\u2019s wife,\u201d Peter adds helpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter . . . oh Jesus Christ, am I supposed to know who that is?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYou know what, forget it. Could you please just do it, Karen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Karen makes a small noise of acknowledgement.</p>\n<p> \u201cAlright,\u201d Tony says. \u201cUnderoos, you\u2019re on speaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on . . . hang on, how many people are here?\u201d Peter asks, and Tony grits his teeth at the eagerness in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly taken role,\u201d says Natasha. Her voice sounds strained, like she\u2019s lifting something heavy. Tony wants to ask if she\u2019s okay, but he know he\u2019d probably only get yelled at.</p>\n<p>\u201cChatter,\u201d says Steve, like they\u2019re still the same team they were during the first Battle of New York. Tony grits his teeth in annoyance at the immediate silence.</p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s broken almost immediately by Peter Parker.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, um, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat exactly do you want me to do? This is kind of the first time I\u2019ve ever fought aliens. Also, do you guys know where that portal goes to? Is it to a different solar system, or . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the nine realms,\u201d Clint grumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s always one of the nine realms. Man, I am getting too old for this shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but there\u2019s literally no scientific evidence to support the existence of nine-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can debate this later,\u201d Steve barks, and suddenly he\u2019s Captain fucking America again. </p>\n<p>It makes Tony punch the next weird robot-alien a bit too hard, and it shatters into a million pieces. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor now, focus on getting civilians out,\u201d Steve tells Peter with that I\u2019m-in-control confidence that he probably was born with. </p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t hesitates. \u201cMr. Stark?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no defiance in his voice. Peter Parker doesn\u2019t have a rude bone in his body. But Tony can\u2019t stop the huge grin from unfolding across his face. Cap can come back with the remainder of his team in tow. He can give out orders like there\u2019s no tomorrow all he wants.</p>\n<p>But those two words, phrased in the polite, questioning manner, made it completely clear who Peter takes orders from.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard him, Underoos,\u201d Tony says, with more affection than he intended. \u201cHelp civilians. Stay out of harm\u2019s way. Don\u2019t do drugs. All that bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fighting gets a lot easier after that. There\u2019s still the hardness in his throat and the annoyance every time Steve opens his fucking mouth. But the warm glow that\u2019s filling his chest doesn\u2019t go away. And every time Peter quips and insults aliens, reassures civilians, and makes his pop culture references, the glow gets a little brighter.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing as an A-team,\u201d Tony says thoughtfully to Pepper, hours later, after the flames have been put out and New York has been saved for the hundredth time.</p>\n<p>She glances at him from beside him on the bed, her eyebrows raised. He knows that she\u2019s the kind of woman who couldn\u2019t care less about some viral video challenge\u2014bless her\u2014 but she humors him anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow so?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>Tony thinks for a second. He thinks about the flip phone he\u2019s never had to use, because Steve shows up exactly when Tony needs him regardless of whether or not Tony calls. He thinks about how Wanda is spending the night in Vision\u2019s room, and how awkward that will probably be in the morning. He thinks about the various bedrooms in the compound that are full for the first time in months. There will probably already be coffee made when he gets up in the morning, because Natasha likes to wake up before the sun.</p>\n<p>He thinks about how Rhodey is probably still awake somewhere, smoothing over things with Ross and trying to create a policy to prevent future alien invasions. He thinks about how Peter still looks at him like he\u2019s a hero, even after everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that we\u2019re just a team with a shit-ton of inner cliques,\u201d Tony says finally. \u201cBut in the end, our A-teams all overlap so much that maybe they never existed in the first place. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s either really observant, or really pretentious,\u201d Pepper tells him. \u201cDoes this mean Steve and company are moving back into the compound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony says, and there\u2019s still a trace of bitterness in his voice that may never fully leave. \u201cHey, do you think I can sweet-talk May into letting Peter stay the weekend? Maybe I can call in a few favors with Nat, get her to teach him how to fight without telling his opponents his entire life story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper smiles. \u201cShe\u2019ll kick his ass for not letting her on his A-team.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony smirks. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll always have that on her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Pepper says. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p>"
