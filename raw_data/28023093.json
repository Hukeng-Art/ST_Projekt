  "notes": "<p>This should have three parts, and is part of my \u201cFrom Samhain to the Solstice\u201d series of fics, as well as a sequel to the first two parts of the series. The title is a Latin word meaning \u201cprophetic\u201d or \u201cmagical.\u201d</p>\n<p>This part of the series is now going to be 4 parts, as this chapter grew too long.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sorry, but this story is going to have a fifth part. The characters all want to talk and fight and not end the fic.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, there's going to be one more part after this.</p>\n<p>Yes, to everyone who guessed that this would have seven parts, you were right. Stupid talking and fighting characters.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for all the reviews! This is the end of the story, and the end of the series.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Harry Potter is getting tired of the chimes ringing from the walls.</p>\n<p>No one else can hear them, so it\u2019s not as if he has to deal with puzzled looks. (Just worshipful ones). But he knows that his mission to come back in time and change it so that the young Slytherins can stand independently of Voldemort and prevent the second war\u2014and the deaths in the second war\u2014has altered.</p>\n<p>The problem is that he doesn\u2019t know how far. And he neither wants to change his original intention to please Time or change what he is doing simply to spite this wearisome power of the universe.</p>\n<p>But he does know that he\u2019s going to do his duty as a professor, a protector, and a defeater of Voldemort.</p>\n<p>In the end, teaching, protection, and war is what he knows best.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I think you are biased against me, Henry, my boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and settles back into the chair near Albus\u2019s desk. He\u2019s had a few of these conversations over the past month, and they\u2019ve only become more difficult since he\u2019s realized that Time wants him to replace Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>Sirius and James have sworn their oaths to him. Harry can see signs that Remus and Peter are drifting in that direction\u2014although Harry has to admit, if only to himself, that he\u2019s going to watch Peter <em>damn </em>carefully\u2014and there are a few Ravenclaws who\u2019ll probably get there before too much longer. The Hufflepuffs are taking longer, cautious about professors outside their Head of House when they\u2019ve been put down so often, but probably when one of them comes, a whole bunch will.</p>\n<p>Harry is pretty sure, from the way that Lily Evans narrows her eyes at him whenever she sees him, that she\u2019ll demand an explanation from James soon, and then probably him, too.</p>\n<p>There are Slytherins who are now fifth-years being led over by Regulus (<em>pulled </em>over, in some cases; Harry will have to speak to Regulus about that soon). Nearly every Slytherin student in sixth and seventh year is already sworn to him, and now some former Slytherins, like Andromeda Tonks and Lucius Malfoy. Lucius, in his last report, dropped hints that Harry is resigned to meaning that Narcissa Black will soon approach him.</p>\n<p>This is not what he <em>wanted. </em>But it\u2019s what he has, and he means to hold his oaths.</p>\n<p>\u201cHenry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks up. Albus appears genuinely concerned, and he might be. It\u2019s just that concern is never far away from Albus\u2019s notions of what he might have to do to win the war, and that\u2019s what makes Harry cautious of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m all right, sir.\u201d Harry forces out a smile and sits up. \u201cJust tired. It\u2019s more challenging to keep up with NEWT students I trained myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes. Your students are doing well in other classes, and applying the lessons that they have said you taught them to their classwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry doubts this is the true purpose of this meeting, but it seems closer to it. He puts on a curious face. \u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, for example, it seems that Mr. Prince has been telling Professor Slughorn that some of the teaching methods he uses, such as asking students to compete against each other for a potion as a prize, don\u2019t work well. He shouldn\u2019t make the students compete against each other, Mr. Prince says. He should have them work together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry holds back a laugh. Severus has mentioned that, but only in passing. Harry had no idea that he was carrying it further. \u201cI haven\u2019t observed one of Professor Slughorn\u2019s classes myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drops back into silence. Albus\u2019s eyebrows go higher and higher as he watches Harry. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all you have to say, my boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cIt does seem to me that we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging our students to compete against each other, but to work together in the face of the war that\u2019s coming. I have to admit that I don\u2019t do anything to encourage the House rivalries and the like in my classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you still split your students into teams and have them compete against each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, of course. It\u2019s the only way to learn some of the dueling procedures and what it\u2019s like to actually face a coordinated group of enemies. But I split the teams up and switch members between each session, so that no one gets invested in feeling like part of a team fighting against the others. And team members are always from more than one House.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut marks\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take the competitive aspect out of that as much as I can. I give exams, but they\u2019re almost always practicals, and they take place in private. If students <em>want </em>to share their marks with each other, they can, but I don\u2019t announce them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus only blinks at him. Harry shrugs a little. He hasn\u2019t hidden what he\u2019s doing. Students talk about it so much that he\u2019s a little surprised Albus hasn\u2019t heard about it before now.</p>\n<p>Then again, does Albus listen to what students have to say, outside his own carefully-chosen group? Harry doubts it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I understand your desire to encourage both cooperation and an independent spirit in our students,\u201d Albus says, picking his way carefully forwards, as if he doesn\u2019t want to explain exactly what he thinks is \u201cwrong\u201d with the situation. Given that it would be hard to find anyone who agreed with him, at least among the Slytherins and most of the Gryffindors, Harry smiles at him. Albus sees it, and his voice firms. \u201cBut I must ask that you ask your students to desist from criticizing the other professors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus pauses. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were doing that, and Mr. Prince, in particular, didn\u2019t strike me as someone who would. I\u2019ll ask them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus narrows his eyes. \u201cWill they obey you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that, Albus. Asking is all I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, Harry <em>could </em>enforce obedience if he intended to be a lord like Voldemort wants to be, and like some of his people want him to be. All he\u2019d have to do would be to slap a brand on some arms and threaten to bar them from his presence.</p>\n<p>But he isn\u2019t going to do that, no matter how smugly the walls are chiming at him right now and how thrilled it would make Regulus (and some other people). Time and teenagers will both have to live with what they\u2019ll get.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to stop? But I thought you would approve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans an elbow on his desk and stares at Severus, who\u2019s standing in front of him looking somewhere between agonized and furious. \u201cI would have expected you to do it <em>subtly, </em>Mr. Prince. As befits the House you\u2019re in and the talents I know you have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus blinks several times, hard. Then he says, \u201cI never thought of it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes a little. It was months before he decided that he could do that in Severus\u2019s presence without the boy taking it the wrong way, but, well, now they have the kind of bond that means he can. \u201cI do encourage you to use your minds. Simply not to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShow other people we\u2019re using them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIrritate other people in their use,\u201d Harry corrects, because the little smirk on Severus\u2019s face is really too much. \u201cDo, please, accept that Professor Slughorn has noticed and complained to the Headmaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus nods, the smirk gone now. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it would get you in trouble, my lord. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stands up. He affects a tone of weary disappointment, not anger, because he knows it\u2019ll work better. \u201cWhat have I told you about using that title?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus winces, but he doesn\u2019t crumple the way he would have a year ago. He simply stares back, his chin rising a little. \u201cWith respect, <em>Professor Salvare, </em>we\u2019re alone, and I think it\u2019s time that we name the reality as what it is. Ignoring it doesn\u2019t make it go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can show respect to each other without ignoring reality. Just as I accepted your name change and haven\u2019t slipped in it, I would think that you could call me what I prefer to be called.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019s face pales dramatically. \u201cI\u2014see. I didn\u2019t think of it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry merely nods. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you had.\u201d The only one who seems to call him lord on purpose while knowing perfectly well that he shouldn\u2019t is Regulus, and Harry will simply continue having talks with him. \u201cNow, as I said, please assert your opinion to Professor Slughorn without making him look like an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn private?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be a <em>start.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus grins and bows his head. When he looks back up, the grin is still there, but it\u2019s altered a bit. \u201cWhat would happen if Professor Dumbledore started paying too much attention to you, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might decide that I\u2019m a threat in the same way that Voldemort is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus gulps. \u201cI see. Something else I didn\u2019t think of.\u201d He straightens his shoulders. \u201cThank you, sir. You\u2019ve given me a great deal to consider.\u201d</p>\n<p>He marches out of the classroom with a determined stride. Harry wonders for a second if he should be worried about Severus trying to get back at Albus, but then dismisses the thought. Even if he tried, Albus would see him coming a mile away, and he has a lot of tolerance for people who are still students in school, Slytherins or not.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Two things happen on Halloween: Lily Evans comes to him to swear her oath, and Harry cracks the use of Voldemort\u2019s blood to find the Horcruxes.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the middle of drawing a huge series of loops all over the parchment spread out in front of him when he hears a knock on the door. Harry calls \u201cCome in!\u201d without looking up. No one will ever see anything but a few doodles on the paper unless they know exactly what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Lily steps in, smiles at him, and glances curiously at the parchment. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir? Some work with Arithmancy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opens his mouth to answer, then sits back and takes a long, hard look at the parchment. It plots the places that the Horcruxes were in his first world\u2014or used to be, in the case of the locket\u2014and the loops are his attempt to make the splatters that Voldemort\u2019s blood creates when he uses it make sense.</p>\n<p>But what if it wasn\u2019t a map? What if it was a <em>graph</em>?</p>\n<p>Harry cackles a little maniacally as he draws a large line down the side of the paper, and then another line along the bottom, and grins as he sees the dots begin to line up. Then he manages to put it aside, and focuses on Lily, who took a step back at the cackle.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Miss Evans, you\u2019ve helped me solve a problem that I was working on. What can I do for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily glances at the parchment as if she assumes that it must be more important than she thought it was, but in the end, shakes her head and refocuses on him. Her eyes are bright. Harry thinks he knows the question that\u2019s going to come out of her mouth.</p>\n<p>In the end, he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you joined the Order of the Phoenix, Professor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry settles back in his chair and considers Lily. She flushes under his scrutiny, but keeps looking steadily at him. She has the spirit that he\u2019s been told about, and from what Harry\u2019s heard, she\u2019s managed a difficult balancing act between her boyfriend and her best friend since she started dating James.</p>\n<p>\u201cHas the Headmaster told you what the Order\u2019s purpose is, Miss Evans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo fight You-Know-Who.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t doing it by partnering with allies, or reinforcing the Aurors, or trying to counteract the fear that Voldemort spreads.\u201d He ignores Lily\u2019s flinch at the name. Not everyone has to be the same in their bravery. \u201cEven the Order\u2019s clashes with the Death Eaters are rare. He thinks that creeping around in the shadows, whispering dire warnings about Voldemort, is the best thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily wrinkles her brow. \u201cWell\u2026don\u2019t we have to be careful around him, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, but fearing him too much doesn\u2019t do anything to stop him. In fact, it\u2019s more likely to make people give up on the battle before it even begins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you think the Headmaster is doing that, then, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that he\u2019s let understandable caution and the desire to keep the Order secret overcome straightforward battle tactics. If he stood up against Voldemort openly and had the Order members do the same thing against the Death Eaters, that would inspire people more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about the duel that you had with You-Know-Who this summer. You didn\u2019t kill him or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry admits. He doesn\u2019t think he should reveal the Horcruxes to someone who\u2019s not even sworn to him yet. \u201cBut I did wound him, and more, I made him look ridiculous in front of a lot of people. Some of the spells I used during the duel, and the fact that I wounded him with a knife, made sure of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Lily puckers her brow harder. Harry finds himself watching her and wondering if he does that in a mirror, and then cuts himself off. He doesn\u2019t need to wonder that, not exactly. \u201cI suppose that is more than the Order does.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cI won\u2019t stop you if you want to join them, Miss Evans. It\u2019s not my place to say how you should fight in this war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you think I should?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Gryffindor who\u2019s questioning me about <em>me </em>joining the Order,\u201d Harry says dryly. \u201cI think you\u2019ve already made your decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re right. And the Headmaster did send me an owl about a week ago telling me some of the information about the Order, and that you hadn\u2019t joined it, and advising me not to join <em>you</em>. But I disregarded it. I think I know more about you than he does, after being in class with you for more than a year.\u201d She draws her wand and stands tall. \u201cI want to join you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry can see that she\u2019s visibly hesitating, and smiles encouragingly at her. \u201cAre you all right, Miss Evans? Did you have something else you wanted to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t Mark me, will you? Only James and Black were joking about that, and I can never tell what\u2019s jokes and what\u2019s not with the pair of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry considers and then discards the idea of saying something about how he doesn\u2019t think James is joking when it comes to his affection for Lily. No, he did <em>not </em>come back in time to matchmake his parents, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo marks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that Voldemort does which I\u2019ve always disapproved of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily gives him a sly smile as she holds out her wand to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem like a very proper lord so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank Merlin,\u201d Harry says, and if his fervency puzzles her, at least she makes the oath with what seems to be a light heart.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for inviting me to come see you, my lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be many more invitations for you if that name keeps up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius hides his smile behind his teacup. Harry shakes his head a little. He knows that Lucius isn\u2019t that much older than the Slytherins that he has in his sixth- and seventh-year classes, but it still feels strange to see him act so <em>young</em>.</p>\n<p>To get rid of that feeling, Harry asks, \u201cYou were able to get away without anyone suspecting that you were coming to Hogwarts?\u2019</p>\n<p>Lucius nods and puts down the teacup. \u201cIt helps that Narcissa and I have moved out of the Manor, and my father no longer has control of my day-to-day life. I told my father that I wished to achieve some more independence to look better to the Ministry,\u201d he adds, before Harry can voice his question about whether Lucius is taking a risk. \u201cThat way, if he gets arrested for his position at Riddle\u2019s side, I can still funnel money and information to Riddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius has refused to call Voldemort anything but \u201cRiddle\u201d since Harry told him the truth about Voldemort\u2019s origins. Well, at least it\u2019s an improvement on \u201cYou-Know-Who.\u201d \u201cVery well. What have you learned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRiddle is furious, my lord.\u201d Harry directs a slashing look at him, and Lucius rolls his eyes a little, but adds, \u201cProfessor Salvare, <em>sir. </em>He hates that you made him look bad in that duel, and more, that you won. He\u2019s recruiting heavily for the Death Eaters, but he\u2019s concentrating on people outside the school. He doesn\u2019t think that most of the people he might Mark here would be able to escape your notice and Dumbledore\u2019s combined.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. That\u2019s one relief, at least. He knows from his historical research before he came back in time that Voldemort did Mark some of the people who were in the years between Lucius and Severus. \u201cAll right. Do you have any names of the recruits?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Bellatrix Black, Rabastan Lestrange, Elbion Shafiq\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry mutters under his breath as he writes them down. He supposes there was never a chance of rescuing Bellatrix, and he would have found it hard to be around her anyway, but he would have liked to try.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says as he finishes, smoothing down the parchment and casting a charm on it that will make it impossible to read for anyone but him. \u201cIt\u2019s valuable information, Lucius.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9e would like to swear an oath to you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods, not really surprised by that. Both Narcissa\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and sister are part of his ranks, so it makes sense that she would ask for it. But the tense expectation in Lucius\u2019s face says that there\u2019s something more to this. \u201cIs there something wrong with the request? Do you not agree that she should be part of our efforts?\u201d</p>\n<p>That wins him a brief smile from Lucius. \u201cI\u2019d like to see someone try and stop her, sir. No, nothing like that. Simply that she\u2019s concerned about my Dark Mark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were able to step around it, as you said.\u201d Harry stares at Lucius with open concern, and tries to silence the calculation in the back of his mind that says this might be a way to get off the path Time has decreed for him. If Lucius needs to be released from his oaths\u2026 \u201cAre you no longer able to be a spy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing like that,\u201d Lucius says, with a sharp shake of his head. \u201cShe simply worries that the Mark can be used to punish me. She would feel easier if you either altered it or gave me a Mark of your own that would replace it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tenses. \u201cMr. Malfoy, I sent you that book on the requirements of declaring oneself a Lord in Britain for a <em>reason.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius blinks innocently at him. \u201cI have no interest in declaring myself a Lord, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry groans and covers his face with one hand for a minute. Then he says, \u201cI can alter the Mark. I won\u2019t be giving you one of my own. Will that be enough to satisfy Miss Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir. If not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius says the last words softly enough that Harry can pretend that he hasn\u2019t heard them. He draws his wand and bends over the Dark Mark, studying it, figuring out the pulsing threads that lead back to Voldemort and might alert him if they\u2019re altered, and the ones that won\u2019t. The actual alteration will need to wait until he\u2019s sure of what he\u2019s seeing, but it can\u2019t hurt to begin now.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry knew from the gleam in Regulus\u2019s eyes when he came through the classroom door that day that he was going to try something, but he never suspected what it actually was. He asked Regulus to show off his defensive Transfiguration in a duel with another fifth-year Slytherin called Crystal Meadowes, and Regulus nodded obediently, but now he whips away from his opponent and launches a Tripping Hex at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry lets the edge of it catch his robe and make him stumble, although not more than that. He can\u2019t afford to lose the respect of his classes, especially his Slytherins, but on the other hand, he thinks Regulus is trying to make him look him supernaturally competent to attract the loyalty of anyone who isn\u2019t in Harry\u2019s fellowship yet. Harry just wants to look a little ordinary.</p>\n<p>Regulus grins at him, and Harry snorts. \u201cPlease direct your spells back at your opponent, Mr. Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus nods and does, but he sends a very obvious smirk at some of the other Slytherins, and a loud, \u201c<em>See</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ah, so that\u2019s it, </em>Harry decides. Regulus is securing his position among the fifth-year Slytherins by showing how powerful his spells are.</p>\n<p>Or so Harry thinks, until he hears Regulus and Meadowes talking as they pack up their books to go to lunch. Maybe they\u2019re only lingering because they don\u2019t have another class to immediately run to, but Harry doubts it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he really let you get away with it.\u201d Meadows shakes her head, her frown in place. Harry knows that in his first timeline, she died among the Death Eaters in a battle two years before Voldemort\u2019s banishing in 1981. He hasn\u2019t approached her yet because she seems doubtful and more entrenched in blood purity than most of them. Besides, if he turns the most prominent and powerful Death Eaters, she\u2019ll probably never get Marked anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he did. I <em>told </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I know you told me. But I never expected it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meadowes gives Harry one more curious glance, and then flushes when she realizes that he\u2019s looking back at her. She leaves hastily. Harry turns to Regulus and makes his gaze go cooler.</p>\n<p>That ceased to work on Regulus a while ago, more\u2019s the pity. Regulus just grins at him. Harry sighs. \u201cMr. Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told Meadowes that you would let me get away with tripping you in front of the class,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t believe me. She didn\u2019t think that a powerful wizard could put up with any kind of humiliation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was hardly a humiliation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo someone like Meadowes, it is. And that means that she\u2019s more likely to think of you as merciful, and someone worth following, instead of <em>him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>can </em>actually do my own recruiting, Mr. Black. If I decide that I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we can help if we want to. Unless you\u2019re going to forbid us that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus has mastered the use of a trembling lip in a pout. It doesn\u2019t work on Harry, but he can see the laughter in the grey eyes behind it, and <em>that </em>does. He rolls his eyes. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t forbid you, Mr. Black, and you know it. But has it occurred to you that I don\u2019t want someone who has to be coerced into following me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is offering them persuasion and evidence coercing them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidence of <em>what</em>? How much I let you get away with things?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorts before he can help himself. He has that reaction a lot around Regulus. He shakes his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true that I want to help and shelter as many people as I can. I don\u2019t want anyone to be forced into serving Voldemort. But I don\u2019t want to reach a particular number of followers or take Voldemort\u2019s place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus stops picking up his books, and gives Harry the most serious look he\u2019s ever seen from him. \u201cProfessor Salvare, I think right now, more than most times in the last century, is a time for powerful wizards. There\u2019s <em>him</em>, and there\u2019s Dumbledore, and there\u2019s ordinary people who don\u2019t have a lot of protection from them. Can you blame them for seeking protection from a powerful wizard who won\u2019t make them into slaves?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hasn\u2019t considered it from that perspective, probably because sheltering behind a powerful wizard was never an option for him. He nods slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course, Mr. Black. But another question occurs to me. If my value to you consists in the fact that I won\u2019t make my followers slaves, why are you trying so hard to make me into a lord, which would ensure that that happens?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus\u2019s jaw drops a little. Then he says, \u201cYou believe that. You really do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowns. \u201cOf course I do. The requirements of becoming a magical lord or lady in Britain ensure it. That act of magic in public that will intimidate people, and the mark on their arms that would brand them\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a middle ground,\u201d Regulus interrupts, his eyes shining with devotion now. \u201cBetween lordship and slavery. I think your own nature would never let you become someone like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaces. He doesn\u2019t have as much faith in himself as Regulus does. He knows what he can do. He knows what he came here to do, and even that has twisted off the path because of Time\u2019s determination to put history back to what it used to be. He doesn\u2019t think Regulus can confidently predict that Harry will always be a good person.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will still not become a lord, Mr. Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll still keep talking you up to the people who might want one but not the ones that exist, Professor Salvare. See you at lunch.\u201d Regulus beams at him and swaggers out the door.</p>\n<p>Harry waits until the door has closed to give a very, very long, and heartfelt, sigh.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no chime from the walls, however, which is interesting. Harry wonders if that will only sound when he makes a move that is more openly towards taking Voldemort\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>With determination, Harry retrieves the graph he\u2019s plotted of Horcrux locations linked by the swirls of Voldemort\u2019s blood. It\u2019s been difficult to work with, since the distances are <em>relative </em>to each other instead of absolute, but he thinks he has a lead on the first one.</p>\n<p>Time to face the Gaunt ring.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Voldemort did move the ring from the shack, and now it\u2019s located on a small, rocky island off Scotland\u2019s coast, one that radiates a powerful Dark curse that makes anyone who approaches feel as if they\u2019re about to come around a corner and face a man-eating predator. Harry\u2019s impressed. It\u2019s not <em>subtle, </em>but it requires more finesse than the spells that Voldemort is prone to using.</p>\n<p>Of course, the island does have its guardians. As soon as Harry uses an incantation to turn the water between the small stepping stone he\u2019s on and the main island to a solid floor, a tail lashes out of the sea and breaks the spell to pieces.</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. He recognizes the gleaming green scales on that appendage, and he knows what sort of beast this is. \u201c<em>Will you listen to him</em>?\u2019 he hisses. \u201c<em>The one who enslaved you? Or me, the one who comes to set you free</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence for a long moment, and then the sea serpent breaks out of the ocean in a dazzling arch, rising and rising, until the green-purple head is swaying a long way above Harry\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>It looks down on him, the pressure of the jade eyes overwhelming. Sea serpents actually hypnotize with their gaze more than they strangle with their bodies, which is the way that some Muggle media portrays them. But Harry isn\u2019t affected by it, given his Parseltongue. After a long moment, the serpent tilts its head to the side and replies, \u201c<em>You cannot set me free. The binding goes down to the ocean floor.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles and sits down on the little stepping stone. He brought another toy with him from the Unspeakables; he\u2019s been visiting the Department of Mysteries here every month or so, when he has news to exchange or listen to. He holds up the crystal sculpture of a serpent and watches the real one flick a tongue in doubt.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What does that do</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It will take your place in the binding spell, so that you may be free and your enslaver will never know that there was a switch.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The way the serpent dances in place tells Harry that his offering has been accepted. He nods and closes his eyes, holding the crystal model in his hands for a long moment, letting it absorb magic and warmth from his touch. Then he opens his eyes and casts it into the sea.</p>\n<p>It dives and swims into the binding that coalesces around the sea serpent, and which Harry only sees then, a complex golden net anchored with something that looks like a trident; the water boils and turns transparent, and Harry sees the anchor through the model\u2019s eyes. Then the crystal one nudges its head through the tines of the trident and swims between them, dodging back and forth, winding the net around itself.</p>\n<p>Voldemort didn\u2019t account for size, or the particular personality of the beast he trapped, or anything remotely similar that would tell him when someone has replaced it. There\u2019s only an alarm spell if the guardian dies. Harry stands up, dusts his hands off, and smiles at the sea serpent.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Done.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The sea serpent turns its head slowly back and forth, reveling in its freedom. Then it shoots its body over the small rock Harry is standing on in a glittering rainbow, disappearing into the water on the other side. Harry laughs and wipes the water away, then once again turns the stretch of sea into a solid pavement.</p>\n<p>This time, no one stops him.</p>\n<p>He lands on the rocky island and feels the immediate pulse of the Resurrection Stone in the ring as it locks onto him. Harry shakes his head a little. The Deathly Hallows think he\u2019s their master. Harry ignores their claim. It\u2019s one of the reasons he became an Unspeakable in the first place, to figure out how to shed it.</p>\n<p>The Elder Wand screamed when Harry used the Time Chamber and a jar of pickles to sever its claim on him in his first world, but that\u2019s its problem.</p>\n<p>He certainly isn\u2019t about to take up the Stone <em>now</em>. He\u2019s here for the Horcrux and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Harry searches carefully, now and then letting the crystal vial of Voldemort\u2019s blood he brought with him swing out like a pendulum, until he finds the ring, tucked in a golden box beneath an outcrop of stone. Harry snorts. Voldemort was smarter about the hiding place this time, but he still couldn\u2019t resist the ornate box.</p>\n<p>Harry kneels down next to it and closes his eyes. The Resurrection Stone trembles like a top in his mind, eager to obey him and destroy the Horcrux if he says so, but Harry is determined <em>not </em>to take up any titles, and that includes the Master of Death.</p>\n<p>Instead, Harry draws on a pair of dragonhide gloves that he borrowed from Professor Kettleburn and modified with silk, then reaches out and flips the box open.</p>\n<p>The ring glows at him, trying to compel him, but it\u2019s not effective against someone who knows what the Horcrux is and about the wasting curse embedded in the ring. Harry uses his wand to Levitate the ring, and lift it up above the island until it\u2019s a good distance from him and the box, both.</p>\n<p>Then he stiffens his back and calls on Fiendfyre.</p>\n<p>Confined to the small space of air between him and the Horcrux, the Fiendfyre can\u2019t rage out of control and become large beasts the way it likes to do. It forms a thread-thin golden serpent with three heads, instead, and falls gleefully on the Horcrux.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a burst of the black blood-like liquid that Harry remembers from the diary and a faint, thin scream. Then the ring disintegrates, and Harry deals with the Fiendfyre as it turns back towards him, hissing out a Parseltongue command. The three-headed serpent actually looks startled as it fades from sight.</p>\n<p>The Resurrection Stone streaks straight towards him, seeking a bond through contact with his bare skin.</p>\n<p>Harry holds up the dragonhide gloves. The Stone bounces off them and straight into the waves. Harry smiles a little as he watches it sink.</p>\n<p>It calls to him, a sad tone that reminds Harry of a begging puppy, but he shakes his head. He\u2019s not in this world to become the Master of Death. He\u2019s here to defeat Voldemort, protect those who chose to swear to him, and make some lives happier.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo time for your false promises,\u201d he murmurs, and then conjures the straight path of water from the island back to his little stepping stone again. Voldemort\u2019s spells mean that there\u2019s no way to Apparate from the island itself.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening, my lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opens his mouth, but Lucius shakes his head from behind Narcissa\u2019s curtseying shoulder. \u201cShe has her own sense of propriety,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the Black family has been raised to address anyone who has a sufficient amount of power that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry narrows his eyes. That would explain some of the problems he\u2019s having with Regulus. On the other hand, Sirius and Andromeda don\u2019t react that way, so he does wonder how much of that is just bollocks.</p>\n<p>(From Lucius\u2019s smirk, perhaps most of it).</p>\n<p>Narcissa straightens up and stares at him. She has large blue-grey eyes and none of the expression of contempt or disgust that Harry saw most often on her face in the future\u2014when he saw her at all. She looks tremblingly hopeful, in fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can get rid of Lucius\u2019s Mark?\u201d she whispers. \u201cSo that he need never regret his choices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could only <em>get rid </em>of it by giving him my own mark, Miss Black,\u201d Harry says gently. \u201cBut I have come up with a different method that will protect him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d And for all the hope in her eyes and the attempt to act like a young girl, Narcissa has the Black calculation down flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to weave a spell around the Mark itself,\u201d Harry says. \u201cIsolate it from him, but not from Voldemort\u2019s magic.\u201d Both of them flinch, but keep looking steadily at him. Harry is just glad that the door of his quarters is firmly shut and he already told his students he would be unavailable to them this evening. He gestures for them to take the couch by the fire. \u201cSo his supposed lord will think that Lucius is still joined to him magically and nothing has changed, but the Mark will have no ability to affect his skin or anything else about him.\u201d He nods to Lucius, who has extended his arm with (absurd) trust. \u201cYou will have to pay closer attention to the Mark, however, Mr. Malfoy. Otherwise, you could miss a summons that he\u2019s issued to you. It\u2019s going to dim the pain of that, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can set up a ward that should do it,\u201d Lucius whispers. \u201cThank you. <em>Thank </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you going to isolate the Mark, my lord?\u201d Narcissa asks.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and lets it pass. \u201cI will have to have your word after this that you will tell no one what I am about to reveal.\u201d They nod eagerly, perhaps because of the idea that Lucius will be free and perhaps because it\u2019s a secret. \u201cI can bind a Mark that was created by a Parselmouth because I\u2019m a Parselmouth myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa settles back on the couch and puts her hand to her mouth for a second. Lucius bows his head, but not before Harry can see his eyes light up in a way he\u2019s learned to dread.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because both Voldemort and I are Parselmouths doesn\u2019t make us worthy of reverence,\u201d Harry snaps, feeling more than a little grumpy, and reaches for Lucius\u2019s left arm.</p>\n<p>Lucius still keeps looking at him as if that\u2019s the case. Harry closes his eyes to escape the stare and seeks the Dark Mark out in his mind.</p>\n<p>The heavy pressure of it on Lucius\u2019s magic is like the smoke of a fire on a distant horizon. Harry spends a few minutes \u201cbreathing it in,\u201d studying it from all angles, making sure that Voldemort hasn\u2019t left some kind of a trap there that Harry isn\u2019t familiar with. Then he exhales hard, and begins to speak in Parseltongue.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mark of the serpent and the skull, obey me. Hear me. You will not touch the skin of the man whose arm you rest on. You will not touch his magic. You will not touch his heart\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hisses out an exhaustive list of everything he doesn\u2019t want the Mark to touch, just in case he\u2019s forgotten something and the Mark will affect what he\u2019s left out. When he finishes the list, he draws his wand and lays it on top of Lucius\u2019s Mark, focusing his will through it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, surprised hiss from the serpent in the Mark, and then a shimmer of Dark magic that Harry wasn\u2019t even aware of vanishes from the corners of his awareness. The Mark has gone dormant.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and releases his will, lifting his wand at the same time. When he opens his eyes, he nods in satisfaction. To all eyes, the Mark is the same as it was before; it hasn\u2019t changed visibly. The connection to Voldemort\u2019s magic should remain intact.</p>\n<p>He glances up, and then away, uncomfortable with the open adoration on Lucius\u2019s face. He stifles a sigh. Perhaps it\u2019s too late once someone becomes a Death Eater and they\u2019ll be a follower for life, but Harry does wish that Lucius would be able to stand on his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d Lucius rolls his sleeve down and tucks his arm back against his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you too magically exhausted to take my oath?\u201d Narcissa asked delicately.</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right, Miss Black.\u201d After he says that, Narcissa hands Lucius a significant glance, but Harry has not the slightest idea why. He decides to ignore it, and draws his wand for the oath.</p>\n<p>Narcissa speaks the words fervently, staring directly into his eyes. Harry lets that pass, as well.</p>\n<p>And he ignores the way that Time is chiming from the wall with noises that sound like a chuckle.</p>\n<p>Harry wakes in the middle of the night with the feeling that <em>something </em>is wrong, although he doesn\u2019t know what. He dresses hastily and runs out into his sitting room, thinking that someone might be trying to reach him through the Floo.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no one there. Harry turns in a circle, frowning, and then conjures the sapphire dot with silver lines that represents the people who\u2019ve sworn oaths with him.</p>\n<p>One of them is glowing bright red, under attack. Harry touches it with his magic, and identifies it as the one representing Andromeda.</p>\n<p>He also receives a strong picture of the location where she\u2019s fighting, as strong an image as a really good description of Apparition coordinates.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs to himself over the way that his bond with his oathsworn is evolving, but only for a moment. Then he spins in place and goes to her, traveling effortlessly through the school\u2019s defenses that prevent Apparition. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s simply invisible to them.</p>\n<p>He lands in a darkened clearing not far from the house that he remembers coming to in the second war in his world. Spellfire crackles and dances around the walls, and Harry can sense the weaknesses in the wards. Large cracks are spreading through them. They\u2019ll be down in a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Harry takes a moment to orient himself, since it seems that neither Andromeda nor anyone else in the house with her\u2014probably Ted Tonks and toddler Nymphadora\u2014is in immediate danger. And then he strides around the corner of the house and launches himself at the two Death Eaters who are there.</p>\n<p>One of them, from the flash of blond hair, is Abraxas Malfoy, who stumbles back from Harry with a startled oath. The other turns at once to face him and cackles in an unsettlingly familiar way.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Black, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d Harry says, in his best, coldest professor voice. \u201cWhat <em>exactly </em>do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas stares at him without a word. Bellatrix, though, swings her wand on him and fires the same curse she was using to weaken the wards.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to hitting him. Harry Apparates away from the spell and into place behind her. Then he locks his arm around her throat and wrenches hard to the side, driving her temple into his carefully-positioned wand. Bellatrix goes down, out cold.</p>\n<p>Harry turns his attention to Abraxas. \u201cThis is the second time that you\u2019ve been involved in an attack on one of my oathsworn, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d he says, and lets his voice descend into a deeper register. \u201cI find it <em>annoying.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas backs up in front of him. Harry assumes he\u2019ll Apparate away, but something, maybe the thought of the renown he could get if he defeats the man who dueled Voldemort, makes him cast a curse instead. It snaps open in front of Harry, a fanged net that will prevent him from casting any spells if it closes around him.</p>\n<p>Harry raises an unimpressed eyebrow and reaches for the spell that\u2019s so deep inside him, he could probably cast it without a wand. \u201c<em>Expecto Patronum.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Prongs explodes in front of him, dashing forwards with lowered antlers. They tear straight through the net, and then he surges past it and tramples Abraxas with an easy motion. Abraxas cries out and then rolls over, gasping, his elbows braced against the ground.</p>\n<p>He goes still when Harry pushes his wand into the back of his neck. \u201cStay down,\u201d Harry murmurs. \u201cI would hate to have to tell your <em>Lord </em>about your death when he seems to depend on your money and Manor a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at the moment. But press further, and try me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas scrambles for his wand, probably planning to Apparate now. Harry shakes his head and Stuns the bastard, then spends a few moments binding both him and Bellatrix with ropes thick enough to hold a giant. He turns around and scans the garden, but no one else is there, no matter how many revealing spells he casts. He supposes that this might have been some sort of training mission for Bellatrix, and Voldemort probably thought a senior Death Eater and one junior one were enough to handle a single pureblood and a Muggleborn.</p>\n<p>The door of the house opens as he\u2019s casting the last of the revealing spells, and Ted Tonks, recognizable even though he\u2019s much younger, leans out with a lit wand. \u201cHello?\u201d he calls uncertainly.</p>\n<p>Harry keeps his opinion of the man\u2019s battle training to himself. \u201cHullo,\u201d he calls back. \u201cAre you and Andromeda and the baby fine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>knew </em>it was Professor Salvare,\u201d Andromeda declares, and pushes her way around Ted. \u201cI knew the moment I felt safe that it would be you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks a little. Well, he supposes that makes sense of Ted\u2019s behavior. \u201cYou felt safe? How did you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know that I was being attacked?\u201d Andromeda folds her arms and stares challengingly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I had a chance to get out a Patronus or a Floo call.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughs. \u201cTrue enough. I think it does come down to the oath we swore. Well, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re safe.\u201d He hesitates, looking over his shoulder at Bellatrix. He honestly doesn\u2019t know if he should tell Andromeda that her own sister was part of the attack, if the truth is worth the pain. After all, Andromedas hasn\u2019t even told her family about her marriage and child.</p>\n<p>But when he glances back at Andromeda, he knows it\u2019s too late, and she\u2019s already seen. Andromeda lets her eyes flutter shut and stands there for a second. Then she opens her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if she gets arrested, then she\u2019ll learn what kind of games she\u2019s playing,\u201d Andromeda says harshly, and turns around and goes back into the house.</p>\n<p>Ted shrugs helplessly at Harry, and together, they begin working to repair the wards around the house.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Ministry is not really impressed that Harry brought in two \u201cprominent citizens\u201d as captives. In that sense, depressingly little will change no matter what period of wizarding history he goes to, Harry thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just <em>arrest </em>a Black and a Malfoy! What gives you the right? You aren\u2019t an Auror!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Rufus Scrimgeour who\u2019s bleating like that. Harry pinches his nose and wishes that he could get back to the school already. He needs his sleep. As it is, the first-year Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff class at eight-o\u2019clock will be murder.</p>\n<p><em>More than it already is. </em>That\u2019s a class full of children who prefer to stick to theory, many of the Ravenclaws because it fits their prejudices and many of the Hufflepuffs because it\u2019s less scary than casting spells.</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes and stands. Scrimgeour puffs up like an irritated owl, but Harry is <em>done </em>with his behavior. He marches across the office\u2014which is small and crowded with framed photographs of famous Aurors, probably all Scrimgeour has to show off when he\u2019s this new in his career\u2014and pulls back Bellatrix\u2019s left sleeve.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s conscious now, even though bound to a chair, and she tries to bite him. Harry stares into her eyes, and she thinks better of it. Not as mad as all that, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis gives me the right,\u201d he says, and bares the Dark Mark on her arm.</p>\n<p>Scrimgeour bolts out of his chair. He stares at the Mark, then at Harry, and then back and forth several times with the air of someone who\u2019s coming up with a theory that he doesn\u2019t like.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know that was there?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who dueled Voldemort this summer,\u201d Harry says, going across the room to roll back the sleeve on Abraxas\u2019s arm and reveal the same thing. He thinks briefly about whether he should deactivate their Marks the way he did Lucius\u2019s, but he has neither the time nor the privacy. He also doesn\u2019t want to reveal that he\u2019s a Parselmouth yet, and well, these fools chose their fate. \u201cOf course I keep track of his Death Eaters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe you put it there yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at Scrimgeour, stunned at the turn his paranoid mind has taken. He could <em>almost </em>believe it of Moody, although not even then. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Voldemort himself, in disguise,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Scrimgeour falls back, fumbling for his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, put that away before you hurt yourself, you young idiot,\u201d Harry snaps, surreal though it feels to say something like that to Scrimgeour, and turns to Bellatrix. \u201cWhom do you serve?\u201d</p>\n<p>She spits at him, but it falls far short. \u201cThe Dark Lord! The rightful Dark Lord of Brittan and Ireland! Not you, you imposter!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have told her to say that. Or spelled her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Henry Salvare, Professor of Defense at Hogwarts, and I\u2019ve brought you these two idiots. Do what you will with them. I\u2019m going home and going to <em>sleep</em>. If someone with the right seniority wants to interview me on a different day, I\u2019ll be available to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scrimgeour flushes. He knows as well as Harry does that he was only there to take custody of the prisoners because it\u2019s three in the morning and he\u2019s on the bottom of the Auror totem pole as a new one. \u201cSomeone will contact you,\u201d he says haughtily.</p>\n<p>Harry nods, and heads for the lifts.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n<em>BELLATRIX BLACK AND ABRAXAS MALFOY, DEATH EATERS?</em>\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a surprise. Harry didn\u2019t expect it to be on the front page of the <em>Prophet.</em> He thought either Voldemort would use some contacts to bury the news, or other Aurors would act like Scrimgeour and assume that Bellatrix and Abraxas must be innocent.</p>\n<p>Harry glances up from the paper and catches Dumbledore\u2019s frustrated look and James\u2019s pleading one. Harry raises his eyebrows. He hopes that he isn\u2019t going to be asked to mediate a relationship conversation. As much as he hopes James and Lily work out in a way, he does <em>not </em>want to matchmake his once-parents while being older than they are. There are some things that should not happen.</p>\n<p>But when he leaves the Great Hall and James falls anxiously into stride with him, it turns out not to be about that at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I do well, Professor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks, thrown, but draws James towards an alcove on the second floor, where they can talk with some privacy about marks if necessary. \u201cDo you mean on the last exam? I told you your mark on the practical portion, and that small written one\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean <em>that</em>! Who cares about marks when there\u2019s a war on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour professors and your girlfriend might have something to say about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>James flushes bright red, but he doesn\u2019t stop jigging from one foot to another. \u201cThe story in the <em>Prophet</em>, sir! That\u2019s what I meant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did\u2014you somehow ensured they reported the story?\u201d</p>\n<p>James nods like an eager first-year. \u201cYes, sir. My father has connections among the Aurors, and some of them always contact him when an especially interesting prisoner is brought in. Well, he wants to keep an eye on the Death Eaters, too, and he\u2019s Scrimgeour\u2019s godfather. So of course he heard about it, and he ensured it got reported in the <em>Prophet </em>because he knows I follow you and he knew it would please you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wants to clasp his hand over his face and drag it all the way down, wiping off this morning and this absurd twist. \u201cSo what you\u2019re suggesting, Mr. Potter, is that I ought to be thanking your father, not you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>sort </em>of me. My father knew it would please you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks at James helplessly, and then laughs. James stops jigging, but still looks at him attentively.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Harry says, and reaches out to ruffle James\u2019s hair before he stops himself. James looks disappointed, so Harry ends up shaking his hand instead. \u201cYou\u2019re growing up, Mr. Potter. Although you might consider the merits of accomplishing things on your own, and not because of your father\u2019s connections.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d James says, in the kind of careless happy tone that Harry knows means he\u2019s paying than less no attention to that last sentence.</p>\n<p>Well, he\u2019s young yet. They all are. So young. He has time to learn better.</p>\n<p>And Harry is going to protect them while they do it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Evan Rosier has been quiet for the past several days, and while he\u2019s often quiet, Harry knows the difference between his intense, listening silence and the kind that means he\u2019s abstracted. He asks Evan to stay behind after the sixth-year Defense class on Thursday, and Evan swallows and does.</p>\n<p>Harry sits down at the nearest desk, which startles Evan, but that\u2019s sort of the point, to wake him up from his mood. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mr. Rosier?\u201d he asks gently.</p>\n<p>Evan closes his eyes, and blurts out the worry, uncharacteristically for him. \u201cMy father owled me. Riddle is furious about the loss of Bellatrix. He wants someone to take her place, and my father volunteered me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blows out his breath softly. \u201cWe have a few options,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can simply ignore your father and come to Decoy House with me for the holidays this year and this summer. I know that you\u2019ll turn seventeen in September, and that means you only have to hide from your father for a few more months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more concerned that he will use a curse on me or try to legally pull me out of school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry narrows his eyes. \u201cAnd that neither the Board of Governors nor Dumbledore will oppose him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust the Headmaster.\u201d Evan clenches his hand. \u201cAnd at least two of the Board of Governors have voiced support for Riddle in the past few years. They might be able to convince the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hesitates. There is an effective way to oppose Dumbledore and the Governors, but it\u2019ll require a public announcement of the kind that Evan might be uncomfortable with. \u201cWould you mind making it known to them that you\u2019re my oathsworn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mind</em>?\u201d Evan says. He whips around to face Harry, his eyes shining. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would permit me to announce it, or I would have asked you about that right away!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I permit you to announce it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to be called a lord, and all the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cAn oath of the kind you swore makes me responsible for your safety and happiness. That means that I can oppose your legal guardians when they make stupid decisions that might hurt you. It has nothing to do with being a lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t make an announcement about being one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan\u2019s disappointment is palpable, and hilarious. Harry just gives him a gentle smile instead of the laughter he wants to let loose, which Evan would misunderstand. \u201cNo, Mr. Rosier. But I can promise you that I\u2019ll be more than happy to make an announcement about your father pressuring you to become a Death Eater. Using those exact words if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evan closes his eyes. \u201cI felt as if I couldn\u2019t escape. I had no idea what to do. I should have known I could count on you, Professor Salvare. <em>Thank </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pats his shoulder and ignores the shining look in his eyes. He\u2019s getting good at that. \u201cThen we\u2019ll wait and see what happens with the Headmaster and the Board of Governors. In the meantime, don\u2019t directly touch or open any owl your father sends you. It could be a Portkey or cursed to make you compliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>A fortnight later, a few days before the end of term when the students will leave for Christmas, Harry sits in a chair in front of the Board of Governors and smiles at them. They\u2019re all purebloods, which isn\u2019t a surprise. The meeting room is; it\u2019s a large room with a flickering fire in a marble fireplace that Harry has never seen before.</p>\n<p>Edward Selwyn, a heavyset man with dark hair that he\u2019s probably color-charming, leans forwards. \u201cI hope that you aren\u2019t thinking to keep a boy from his rightful legal guardian, Mr. Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks at him coolly. \u201cI\u2019m protecting someone oathsworn to me from a threat to make him into a Death Eater.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s funny to see how quickly their faces pale at the name. Did they not expect him to talk about it openly? Or maybe they didn\u2019t expect Rosier\u2019s father to say it so openly in his letters.</p>\n<p>Albus, who\u2019s sitting in a big, fluffy red-and-gold chair he conjured, clears his throat noisily. \u201cSurely, Henry, my boy, the threat isn\u2019t that extreme. You know how teenagers exaggerate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do have a letter from Mr. Rosier\u2019s father here, where he uses the term,\u201d Harry says helpfully, and holds the parchment out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s passed from hand to hand on the Board of Governors, and by the end, a few of them look ill, and others furious. Harry can\u2019t be sure that either set of them are on his side, or Evan\u2019s, but it does matter to him that they aren\u2019t a united front and they aren\u2019t falling into Albus\u2019s pocket. He crosses his legs and waits patiently for the questions that he\u2019s sure will be fired at him.</p>\n<p>Selwyn takes the lead again. \u201cYou think that Mr. Rosier is against this desire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me he was, very explicitly. He doesn\u2019t like the way Riddle tortures his followers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Selwyn blinks. \u201cWhat do you mean, Riddle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTom Marvolo Riddle,\u201d Harry says, helpful again. \u201cThat\u2019s Voldemort\u2019s real name. The one he made into a ridiculous anagram when he decided that his name was too <em>Muggle.</em>\u201d He draws his wand and casts the fiery letters into the air, making them swirl and dance into the I AM LORD VOLDEMORT anagram. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. Or, at least, it would be if Riddle didn\u2019t take out his fury at his name on innocents.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Board of Governors stare at it. Then Cedrella Black says, in a tone of wonder, \u201cBut that\u2019s <em>stupid.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Harry shrugs and dismisses the letters with another wave of his wand. \u201cThen again, not that many people know his real name. That means that he can get away with pretending that his pseudonym means something pretentious and impressive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think him a threat?\u201d That\u2019s Herbert Yaxley, the one member besides Selwyn whom Evan told Harry would probably speak in support of Voldemort.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019s powerful,\u201d Harry says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s so impossibly powerful that we need to bow down to him.\u201d He watches closely, and sees Yaxley flinch as those words hit him. Good. The more people Harry can make reconsider associating with Voldemort, the easier it\u2019ll be to defeat him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are getting rather far afield from the matter that brought us here,\u201d Albus intervenes in a strained voice. \u201cWe need to determine if Professor Salvare is allowed to interfere in a legal guardianship situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of oaths did you have Evan Rosier swear to you?\u201d demands Yaxley.</p>\n<p>\u201cOaths that mean we are companions in providing for and protecting each other,\u201d Harry says. \u201cAnd that I am responsible for his safety and happiness. Allowing him to go home to his father would violate them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you provide for him?\u201d asks a quiet woman with the face of a Longbottom. Harry doesn\u2019t think he got her name.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a large former manor house where the members of my oathsworn order are allowed to shelter.\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t look at Edward Selwyn, whose family used to own the house, because he\u2019s afraid the man might see his opinion of the house\u2019s d\u00e9cor in his expression. \u201cI have enough money to buy them food and Potions ingredients and other things that they might need. Several of them who have untenable home situations lived with me during the past summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRather an unsavory situation,\u201d mutters Selwyn.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe oaths that bind me and them would also act to prevent me from taking advantage of them in the way you\u2019re suggesting,\u201d Harry informs him calmly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll keep in mind that you thought about it, and keep you away from my students.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over the sound of Selwyn\u2019s spluttering, Cedrella Black says, \u201cI understand that you sheltered one of my young relatives this past summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegulus Black. Yes.\u201d Harry nods to her. \u201cHe\u2019s sworn to me, and his parents were being unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnreasonable. That\u2019s a good description of Orion and Walburga.\u201d Cedrella sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you encouraging him, Black?\u201d Yaxley demands. \u201cIf he can just seize control of any child and disrupt any legal arrangement that he wants\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t abuse your children, and he won\u2019t have to,\u201d Cedrella snaps, a moment before Harry would have said something like that himself. He sits back with a smile. It\u2019s better if it comes from her, someone they have more reason to respect. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to him, and I\u2019ve listened to Regulus, who\u2019s been writing to me. Professor Salvare is in the business of <em>protecting </em>children, not\u2014doing what you made a disgusting insinuation about. I see no reason to say that he must give Evan Rosier back to a father who would see him Marked as a Death Eater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI must insist,\u201d Albus says in a gentle voice, \u201cthat the Board of Governors think about this some more. After all, what would happen if a teenager who does <em>not </em>come from an abusive household convinced Henry here to stand up for him or her, just to get back at their parents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Mr. Rosier\u2019s situation is of that kind, Albus?\u201d Cedrella asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I am only saying that we cannot allow Henry to just adopt anyone he wants to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an oath, not a legal adoption. And I am a little shocked that you don\u2019t approve of this, Headmaster.\u201d The Longbottom Board member is frowning at Albus. \u201cSomeone who defends children from parents who would see them branded by a madman? Who would try to stand in the way of something like that?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Someone who follows the madman, </em>Harry thinks, and carefully doesn\u2019t look towards Selwyn or Yaxley.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am concerned about the misuse of a professor\u2019s power, that\u2019s all,\u201d Albus insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you could be a bit more concerned about the fate of the students,\u201d Cedrella Black says, and from there, it becomes an argument about what\u2019s clearly an old issue between Albus and the Board, with their disagreement about some of his past decisions. Harry waits it out, and they come down as he was confident they would, in agreeing that Evan Rosier cannot be, and does not deserve to be, forced home to his father\u2019s house against his will.</p>\n<p>Harry is whistling jauntily as he leaves the room and steps onto the moving staircase that will take him to his office, but Albus walks up beside him and gives him a stare of heavy, silent disapproval.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Harry asks, when the staircase has swung through most of an arc and linked up with the flight waiting below them. \u201cCome on, Albus, tell me what you\u2019re going to say and then leave. I\u2019d like to reassure Mr. Rosier of his safety before the students go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot simply interfere between students and their parents like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the oaths that he swore to me and his utter rejection of what his father wants for him, Mr. Rosier gave me permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the severing of family bonds,\u201d Albus insists, lowering his voice as if he thinks that someone is going to step out from a secret passage and tell him off. \u201cThe disruption of family love. Love is the greatest force in this world, Mr. Salvare.\u201d <em>I suppose I don\u2019t rate a \u201cHenry\u201d when he\u2019s upset with me, </em>Harry thinks. \u201cI try to foster friendships between the students and respect for the professors, but I do not step into the loving relationships between students and their families.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe loving ones, I don\u2019t see a need to do anything about,\u201d Harry admits with an easy shrug. \u201cThe non-loving ones? Those I do. The magical world gives an absurd amount of power to parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoken like someone not raised in the magical world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you knew I was a half-blood,\u201d Harry says as easily, and starts to walk away.</p>\n<p>Albus keeps pace with him. \u201cIt was also not wise to release the information about Tom\u2019s true name into the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt must be carefully controlled. Used when the time is proper. The Board of Governors may misuse it, or even warn Voldemort that you told them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret to Riddle that I\u2019m coming for him, Albus. He\u2019s known that since our duel this summer. And I think the more people who know the truth about him, the better. They\u2019ll back away from that hypocritical idiot, and he\u2019ll be deprived of followers and the fear they generate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em>must </em>fear him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asks, as gently as he can. \u201cWhat will fear do that getting ready to face him won\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus\u2019s head twitches back and forth slowly. \u201cWe must face him as a united front.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it would help if you would stop telling Gryffindors that they shouldn\u2019t take Defense and they should be afraid of me.\u201d Harry sighs a little when Albus stares at him. \u201cYes, I know that you\u2019re doing that. I haven\u2019t said anything because, frankly, the ones who are going to listen to you aren\u2019t the ones I would want to swear oaths to anyway. But it puzzles me <em>why </em>you\u2019re doing it when, as you said, we should be united.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am afraid of you, too,\u201d Albus says quietly. \u201cI know what you say about the oaths that you swear to your followers being mutual and the like, but you are still building an army.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you fear that I\u2019ll use it against you. Or join Riddle?\u201d Harry sighs again when Albus hesitates. \u201cYou <em>must </em>know how silly that is. I just got through telling you that he knows I\u2019m going to fight him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis war needs one leader, not two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think that leader is you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus glances at Harry, his gaze mild but firm. \u201cOf the two of us, I <em>am</em> the one who has defeated a Dark Lord before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorts, and then holds up his hand as Albus stares at him with what looks like incredulous anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He can\u2019t explain what\u2019s funny, anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t think that this war has much in common with Grindlewald\u2019s war. He was working with the Muggles, and Riddle shows no signs of that. Plus, he\u2019s still in the stage of recruiting followers and trying to make people fear his name. We have a chance to stop him before he gets anything close to the power that Grindelwald had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd can you really trust all your followers? The ones that belong to Dark families, and wield Dark Arts, and are in Slytherin House?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that you\u2019ll alienate them with your distrust of Dark Arts and your fixation on House politics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou speak as though you have used Dark Arts yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thinks of the Fiendfyre scarring the air between him and the ring Horcrux, and only barely refrains from another snort. \u201cStudents don\u2019t deserve to be alienated, Albus. They deserve someone who will put their interests in the forefront, and protect them, and not assume from the start that they\u2019re evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Slytherins are evil,\u201d Albus protests. \u201cI simply think they are more likely to be exposed to undesirable influences because of the other people in their House.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I one of those undesirable influences? What about their siblings? What about anyone who\u2019s not in Gryffindor?\u2019</p>\n<p>Albus lowers his head. He sounds miserable when he says, \u201cYou see, I simply do not know who I can trust <em>unless </em>they are in Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head a little and sighs, walking away. He wonders, idly, what will happen if the day ever comes when he can tell Albus about his time travel. What will the man\u2019s face look like when he realizes that Harry <em>was </em>a Gryffindor, once upon a time?</p>\n<p>Harry hopes that the day comes. He hopes he can see the expression.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Christmas!\u201d</p>\n<p>The chorus comes from the throats of everyone in the large drawing room at Decoy House as Harry steps into it. Harry grins. Evan, Severus, Regulus, and the others staying with him have decorated the walls with swirls of silver and green\u2014with a few stubborn splashes of red and gold from visits by Sirius, Lily, and James\u2014and fairy lights on every surface that will hold them. A huge Yule log is burning in the fireplace, and a tree stands in the center of the room with star-shaped decorations weighing down all the branches.</p>\n<p>Harry has a pile of gifts under the tree, too, purchased with Galleons that he\u2019s taken from vaults held for the Unspeakables. He got a few books that he knew their recipients would like, but the main gifts are the ones that his oathsworn open this morning. There\u2019s a wave of gasps that sweeps the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre these\u2014\u201d Evan is staring at the ring in his hand. \u201cAre these <em>platinum</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hums and nods. \u201cThe very best material for attaching protective charms and runes to,\u201d he says smugly, when a bunch of faces turn to stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew <em>that</em>.\u201d Severus, sitting cross-legged next to the fire with Lily beside him, looks offended that Harry thought he wouldn\u2019t know that. \u201cBut how did you afford them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBought a few and used the Duplication Charm on them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily\u2019s eyes widen, as she grasps the implication before anyone else in the room. \u201cBut you could only use a <em>permanent </em>Duplication Charm if you were really powerful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sweeps an extravagant bow towards them, and there\u2019s some chuckles and some stares and some chatter as his oathsworn start talking about what they\u2019re going to do with the rings. In the middle of all that, Harry hears the Floo chime at him.</p>\n<p>When he steps into the room where that fireplace is, he\u2019s beyond surprised to see Peter Pettigrew\u2019s head floating in the flames. \u201cHappy Christmas, Mr. Pettigrew,\u201d he says. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter licks his lips. Then he says, \u201cIs it all right if I come over and swear the oaths today, Professor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, if you want to,\u201d Harry says, and kicks the memories of another lifetime in the face to get them to stop whispering distrust of this boy to him. \u201cBut I do have to ask, what changed your mind? The last I knew, you were telling Mr. Black the elder and Mr. Potter that you didn\u2019t think they should have sworn to me, that following me was no different than joining the Order of the Phoenix.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother lost a friend to the Death Eaters,\u201d Peter says softly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to go without protection against <em>him</em>. And I don\u2019t know what Professor Dumbledore intends to do about it, but he\u2019s moving too slowly for my taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods, and listens hard as Peter Floos in after Harry gives him permission. No, there are no chimes from the walls. At least he can hope that history isn\u2019t going to repeat to the extent that Peter is going to betray anyone in Decoy House right now.</p>\n<p>And from the grim determination in Peter\u2019s face when he hands his wand to Harry, this is one of the beneficial changes to the timeline. Peter Pettigrew has found the courage to make and stick with a decision.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s head shoots up. He was taking a nap on the couch in the drawing room, near the big Christmas tree, but once again, as when Bellatrix and Abraxas attacked Andromeda, the feeling of danger brings him right out of sleep.</p>\n<p>He touches the silver line in his mind, and it blazes.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Regulus.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry snarls and snatches his wand. Then he subdues his homicidal urge to Apparate straight to the spot, and goes to retrieve a few of the toys that the Unspeakables in this time have been experimenting with, and want him to test.</p>\n<p>This is a trap, he\u2019s sure, not just an attack. Regulus was shopping in Diagon Alley today, looking for books on runes to decide what the best ones are to add to their rings, and Severus and Sirius went with him. If they were also in danger, <em>their </em>oaths would be jangling against Harry\u2019s teeth, also urging him to hurry. No, Regulus has been snatched, and Harry will be walking into a situation where Voldemort\u2019s had time to prepare his ground.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hand clenches, and nearly destroys the delicate crystalline lion that he\u2019s slipping into his pocket.</p>\n<p><em>No. </em>He can\u2019t let the oath control him. He has to <em>think</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord! My lord!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s Severus. He\u2019s never sounded more frantic, even the night that Harry rescued <em>him</em> from Voldemort back in June. Harry comes hurrying out of the drawing room and grabs Severus\u2019s arm as he nearly falls to the floor after his exit from the Floo. \u201cCalm down, Severus.\u201d He conjures a glass of water for the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014you don\u2019t understand\u2014Regulus\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do understand, and I\u2019m going to find him,\u201d Harry says firmly, forcing the water glass into Severus\u2019s hand. \u201cListen to me. Where is Sirius?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe tried to Apparate after them, but he couldn\u2019t. They were too fast. I think Black is still searching Diagon Alley.\u201d Severus still sounds as if he wants to babble, but he takes a deep breath and swallows some of the water. \u201cMy lord, <em>listen</em>\u2014they were saying they were going to <em>Mark </em>Regulus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry feels the hatred, hot and sharp, that Voldemort inspires in him rear his head. This fight will be serious in a way that their duel this summer wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he says, and he won\u2019t. If he has to create his own mark to replace the Dark Mark, then he would. For someone Marked against their will, he would do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord\u2026what happens now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stay here, and I find him and save him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I want to go with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks hard into Severus\u2019s eyes, and sees that he means it. For right now, he\u2019s as courageous as any Gryffindor. That means Harry will have to raise the wards around Decoy House, the way he would to contain a Gryffindor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you serious about claiming me as your lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus stands straight at once. \u201cYou know I am. We\u2019ve all been serious for <em>months.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen your lord orders you to stay here, and out of the battle. Do you understand me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019s mouth falls open. Harry taps his shoulder. \u201cA lord isn\u2019t only for when it\u2019s convenient. <em>Do you understand? </em>I don\u2019t need the distraction of you when I\u2019m trying to rescue Regulus, and you\u2019re not powerful or talented enough to assist me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus swallows and bows his head. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry can hear the hardness of resentment in his voice, and undercuts it by hugging Severus with one arm. \u201cI know that you would do your best, but this is my battle. Stay here. If anyone else comes through the Floo\u2014\u201d not that they\u2019ll be able to once Harry has raised the wards \u201c\u2014tell them the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus cheers up a little at the prospect of essentially being made second-in-command, but he mostly looks rabid with worry. \u201cSave him. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says, a promise, and then he raises the wards, before leaping through them to Regulus\u2019s location. As with the wards on Hogwarts the night he went to Andromeda\u2019s house, they part around him like water.</p>\n<p>This time, though, water that Harry could have heated to boiling with his temper.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m coming, Regulus.</em>\n</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry appears inside a gigantic cage. Silver bars arch overhead, above the tree in the center of the dark green field with an altar at its roots. Regulus is manacled, spread-eagled, on the altar, his left arm supported by a second block of granite. Harry is more relieved than he can say that that there\u2019s no Mark there.</p>\n<p>The minute after he notices that, the bars hiss and ignite with a flash of white radiance. Harry is standing inside a gigantic cage <em>on fire </em>now, and the flames arch down towards him, eating slowly along the bars. Then the bars shrink a little, coming closer.</p>\n<p>Voldemort strolls into view on his right, spinning his yew wand between his fingers. Harry looks hard at him. He\u2019s alone, or at least the other Death Eaters are maintaining a respectful distance as dark blurry figures in the distance, but at the same time, he doesn\u2019t feel alone to Harry\u2019s senses. It\u2019s as if Voldemort has two invisible people moving along with him, people who radiate Dark magic .</p>\n<p>Right next to him. And yet, Harry doesn\u2019t see any telltale shimmer of a Disillusionment Charm, or any place where someone\u2019s feet under an Invisibility Cloak are bending the grass.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Horcruxes. Two of them. He has them with him.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s drawing on them to fuel this spell.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hand goes into his robe pocket, to his crystal lion. But even with that, it\u2019s going to be hard to get out of this trap.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt last, Professor Salvare,\u201d Voldemort says, his red eyes alight with the closest that he can probably come to happiness. \u201cWe meet the way it <em>should </em>be. Not that either you or your young follower will survive long.\u201d He nods to the fire that is coming closer and closer, down the bars of the cage as they shrink slowly inwards. \u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cGo fuck yourself, Riddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tosses the lion, and it pivots in the air, hitting the ground and transforming immediately into a life-sized version, still made of crystal. It bows its head and roars, and Voldemort stumbles back a step in the face of that roar.</p>\n<p>Harry waves his hand at the lion, and it bounds forwards, passing through the burning spaces in the bars without a pause. Voldemort wants Harry\u2019s death to be slow, which means the magical fire isn\u2019t hot enough to burn crystal.</p>\n<p>The lion\u2019s heavy paw crashes into a shield that Voldemort\u2019s raised in front of himself, and the lion roars again and rears up, drumming paw-blow after paw-blow into the shield. Voldemort is shaking with effort, and Harry can see the fire dimming a little out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Harry runs towards Regulus. If the trap falters, they have to be ready to move as soon as it comes down.</p>\n<p>He snaps the bonds that hold Regulus\u2019s left arm out first, and then the rest of them, freezing the chains before melting the ice. Regulus reaches for him with a sob. Harry gathers him close, casting a subtle Lightening Charm so he can handle the boy more easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they torture you?\u201d he whispers as he watches Voldemort staggering under the lion\u2019s assault. The more it can weaken him, the better.</p>\n<p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth firms. He\u2019s going to take revenge for that if he can, but later.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tremendous shattering sound, and Harry wheels around. Voldemort has managed to fire a Blasting Curse in the right place to break the lion, and now he stalks towards the cage with his eyes bright as volcanoes. The lion got at least one blow through, Harry sees, and Voldemort\u2019s pale chest is bleeding.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of gold around his neck, which means one of the Horcruxes is the locket. And Harry can see his robe sagging a little, the pocket rounded, and thinks that probably means the other is the cup.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What do you think you are doing?\u201d </em>Voldemort hisses. \u201c<em>Do you still believe that you\u2019ll get out alive</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rests one hand on Regulus\u2019s forehead. \u201cRegulus,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m powerful enough to fight him alone. Can you lend me some of your magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus swallows audibly and whispers, \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConcentrate on the memory of giving me your oath. Recall it as clearly as you can. And then imagine your oath as a conduit between the two of us, and feed your magic down that link.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence\u2014well, silent except for Voldemort raging away in Parseltongue, stupid arguments that Harry feels no need to listen to\u2014and then the link between him and Regulus flares to life. Harry seizes the magic, which feels like a warm spring of water in the center of his chest, and hurls it, along with his own power, into the spell. He speaks the incantation in Parseltongue.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fiendfyre</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The spell spills forth from his wand as multiple brightly-burning snakes. A dozen, two dozen, three. Harry stops it there, even though Regulus\u2019s magic plus his own means that he feels like he could go on and conjure others. The problem is going to be controlling them, not conjuring them.</p>\n<p>Voldemort stares at the snakes with his eyes narrowed. He probably doesn\u2019t know exactly what Harry intends with them, or he\u2019s confident that they can\u2019t get out of the cage he has Harry and Regulus trapped in.</p>\n<p>Could be either, really. Lack of intelligence and suicidal overconfidence were both traits of Voldemort\u2019s in the future, too.</p>\n<p>Harry hisses, \u201c<em>Forwards.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the snakes turns back towards him and Regulus, testing his control. Harry hisses again, and the snake turns and slithers after the others. They\u2019re turning more and more gold and red. Harry rolls his eyes and lets them.</p>\n<p>Voldemort doesn\u2019t seem to believe anything is wrong until the first of the snakes crawls through the burning bars of the cage. Of course, Fiendfyre is more powerful than the magical cage he\u2019s got going, too.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>This cannot be happening</em>!\u201d he cries out. Harry hears a murmur from the Death Eaters gathered somewhere in the distance and wishes, fiercely, that he knew what they were thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shouldn\u2019t have left spaces between the bars, Tom</em>,\u201d Harry hisses mockingly. He knows full well that Voldemort thinks Harry shouldn\u2019t be able to cast magic from within the cage, and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to if he had been surrounded by a solid sheet of flame. But the gaps in the bars, even as the bars tighten and shrink steadily, mean that Harry can reach through them with any magic that can\u2019t burn.</p>\n<p>Now all the Fiendfyre snakes are out of the cage, and slithering rapidly towards Voldemort. The grass burns behind them. Voldemort retreats a step, and then seems to decide that he can\u2019t lose face in front of his followers. He stops and lifts his chin proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Not even Fiendfyre can destroy me</em>!\u201d he brags, extending his arms. \u201c<em>I am immortal</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t seem to realize that proclaiming that in Parseltongue lessens the impact, with Harry the only one around who can understand him. Harry doesn\u2019t deign to tell him, though.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m not aiming for you</em>,\u201d Harry says sweetly, even as the first of the Fiendfyre snakes reaches Voldemort and lunges up his body, growing as it does so to the size of a python.</p>\n<p>Voldemort\u2019s flesh trembles, but doesn\u2019t burn. The locket around his throat, however, lights up like a firework, and there\u2019s a long, thin, dying scream that beats even the scream of the ring when Harry destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Voldemort screams too, then, and gropes towards his robe pocket. However, he only finds more Fiendfyre snakes, who have delved into the pocket, and there\u2019s another wail and a flying shard of twisting metal lunges into the air before a Fiendfyre snake, twisting like a tornado of flame, rises and burns that as well.</p>\n<p>Voldemort\u2019s pain and shock, and the sudden loss of the Horcruxes that were powering his spell, stops the shrinking of the cage. And, more to the point, it drops the spells that were preventing Apparition <em>out </em>of the cage.</p>\n<p>Harry grabs Regulus close to him, focuses as hard as he can on the courtyard of Decoy House, and Apparates.</p>\n<p>He crashes to the cobblestones outside the wards, swearing and sweating, and shuts down the conduit between him and Regulus before he drains the boy of magic entirely. Regulus lets his head loll back and stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was bloody <em>brilliant</em>,\u201d he declares.</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes and thinks, <em>Bloody teenagers.</em></p>\n<p>But listening to Regulus is better than listening to the sound that ripped through the fabric of space and time as they Apparated: an enormous, sickly-sweet, smug chime.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles a little at Severus. The boy\u2019s eyes are wide after watching Harry limp down the stairs and into the kitchen. Harry didn\u2019t even have a chance to make his own cup of tea. Severus shoved one at him immediately, and Harry sat down with the hot cup and drained it. He\u2019s too tired to refuse it after last night.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mr. Prince. I just went through a lot in a short time. Apparating, fighting Voldemort, and rescuing Regulus.\u201d Harry leans back in his chair, wincing. All his muscles are contributing to a chorus of protest that makes him think he might not even be able to hear the chimes if Time decided to talk to him now. \u201cMr. Black told you what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. He said you used his magic, sir. Is that something you could do with the rest of us? Could you have been doing it all this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. Severus\u2019s eyes are wide and shuttered at the same time. Unusually, Harry can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI used it last night because I had to,\u201d he says honestly. \u201cVoldemort had brought help to the fight\u2014artifacts of his own that strengthened his power\u2014and I don\u2019t think that I could have faced him and escaped the trap without Mr. Black\u2019s help. But if you\u2019re worried about me draining you dry, you don\u2019t need to worry about that, Mr. Prince. It would need <em>both </em>of us to use the oath\u2019s link like that. It\u2019s not something just one person could do from one side or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus turns away from him with a sharp curse and walks to the far side of the dining room.</p>\n<p><em>Okay, </em>Harry thinks, and starts to rise to go after his next cuppa. Severus curses again and hurries over to take the cup, bringing it back full of hot tea and with a plate that has scones and butter on it. Harry grins at him before tearing into it. He\u2019s going to need meat, too, as he knows from long experience with this kind of magical exhaustion, but that can wait.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Severus says, sounding as if he\u2019s struggling to control his voice. \u201cI would <em>never </em>worry about that. What I\u2019m worried about is <em>you</em>, sir. You need to call on our magic, if that\u2019s possible for you, whenever you need it. Not wait until you\u2019re <em>in extremis</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. \u201cHave I given you the impression that I\u2019ve been in a situation this desperate before, Mr. Prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes his tone lightly chiding, but Severus neither cowers nor smiles. \u201cNo, sir. But you could have used our help when you fought the duel with\u2014<em>Voldemort </em>last summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need it,\u201d Harry says gently. \u201cI intended all along to do what I did, and Voldemort\u2019s arrogance overpowered him, the way it did last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be that arrogant again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry has to consider it. He does at least think that Voldemort won\u2019t bring Horcruxes to a fight with Harry again, no matter what kind of power they might give him, but that\u2019s not the kind of thing he can explain to Severus. \u201cNo,\u201d he says at last. \u201cBut a different kind, yes. It\u2019s a flaw as deep in him as his breath. He might take precautions against it, but they\u2019ll never be enough, because he\u2019ll continue to underestimate me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus leans an elbow on the back of his usual chair instead of sitting down in it. \u201cI never thought to see <em>you</em> overpowered by the same arrogance, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I am?\u201d Harry chews his scone slowly. Good God, he\u2019s hungry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, because you aren\u2019t using <em>all </em>your advantages.\u201d Severus\u2019s eyes are wide and burning now, and Harry no longer has problems reading them. \u201cUse our magic, sir. Let us stand with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks directly at him. Severus does flinch this time, but doesn\u2019t back away. \u201cYou want me to drag fifteen-year-olds onto the battlefield? Sixteen-year-olds? You think that would make me a <em>better </em>man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take all of us. You could leave some of us in a sheltered place and have them feed you their magic across a distance. That\u2019s possible, isn\u2019t it? The way that you managed to find Regulus at a distance and Apparate to him last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and starts to complain that Severus is too damn smart, but Severus continues. \u201cSir, in a week I\u2019ll be of age. And you know that I\u2019m not the only one. There\u2019s people like Andromeda and Lucius who\u2019ve already graduated, and people like Tiberius who\u2019ve already turned seventeen. We\u2019re old enough to make our own decisions about who we vote for and cast magic without restriction, that\u2019s what the magical world says. We\u2019re old enough to make our own decisions about going to war, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swears under his breath. Severus smiles a little, obviously understanding the importance of the words if not hearing all of them, but his gaze remains steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to protect you,\u201d Harry says, in a voice so bitter he barely recognizes it himself. \u201cHelp you. Give you an alternative to the pressures that could have forced you to become a Death Eater. You and the others,\u201d he adds, because he doesn\u2019t want Severus to think that this decision is only being made for him. \u201cAnd give other students a better Defense education and more of a chance to define their own futures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that fighting with you is a choice for the future? I know that we\u2019re defending the future from <em>him </em>if we do this, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking. I think that teenagers should never be asked to fight a war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re the ones asking,\u201d Severus says, with a small smile. \u201cAnd we\u2019re <em>adults. </em>I\u2019ve already told you what to do about the ones who aren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think Mr. Black is going to appreciate that, Severus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not seventeen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019s voice is so prim that Harry can\u2019t help laughing. Severus nods to him and then disappears into the kitchen and comes back with a platter full of sausages. Harry can feel the hunger cramping at his stomach, and he reaches immediately for the large fork and knife that Severus brought along.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou burned a lot of magic last night,\u201d Severus says softly after Harry has eaten over half the platter.</p>\n<p>Harry eyes him, and swallows. \u201cI would do the same for any of you, Severus. You have to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do know that,\u201d Severus says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying now is, <em>my lord, </em>you burned a lot of magic last night. What happens if the next time you have to do that, you die, because you\u2019re so reluctant to use one of your best weapons? What if\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You are not a weapon.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The words make the wards pop and twang, Harry\u2019s so furious. Severus leans back in his chair, his hands braced on the table and his eyes wide. Harry turns away from him and goes back to eating. He just doesn\u2019t trust the next words that might come out of his mouth right now.</p>\n<p>Severus clears his throat a second later. \u201cI think I\u2019m beginning to understand you better now, and why you\u2019re so bloody reluctant to use us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grunts and continues eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone used you,\u201d Severus says. \u201cMaybe many people. And that means that you can\u2019t stand to see it happen to others. You\u2019ll take stupid risks and do similar things so that we can\u2019t share the burden with you. But what was it you said to Regulus last year? That we\u2019ll make changes <em>together.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scowls at him over the top of his loaded fork.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut don\u2019t we deserve to stand at your side as equals?\u201d Severus raises his eyebrows a little. \u201cTo make our own decisions? I hope that we do. I hope that you\u2019ll see it that way.\u201d He reaches out and puts a hand as firm as a Mark on Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cAnd what your death would do to us, the ones that you\u2019ve tried to keep safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands up and leaves the dining room without looking back. Only the magical exhaustion enables Harry to finish the platter of sausages, and then he leans back and looks up at the ceiling as he finishes his tea again.</p>\n<p>The Selwyns put up bloody ugly decorations on the ceilings, too.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>James\u2019s face is innocent in a way that Harry doesn\u2019t trust. He shakes the <em>Prophet </em>at James where he\u2019s kneeling down in front of the fire. James is on the other side of the Floo, still at the Potter house. \u201cIs this your doing, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>James shakes his head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen at the Ministry, sir, did it? That means that it couldn\u2019t be my dad\u2019s contacts who got it printed.\u201d He ducks his head, but his grin still breaks out like a wound across his face.</p>\n<p>Harry glares at the front page of the <em>Prophet. </em>It has a picture of him that someone must have taken at Hogwarts, walking down a staircase with his cloak flaring behind him. He doesn\u2019t remember it, though, or someone pointing a camera at him.</p>\n<p>\n<em>PROFESSOR HENRY SALVARE DEFIES THE DARK LORD!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Beneath it is a surprisingly accurate retelling of what happened two nights ago when he rescued Regulus. Harry drums his fingers in a long roll on the hearth. That means that it has to be one of the Death Eaters who told the reporters the story, although Harry is still a little astonished that they had the wherewithal to print a story that makes Voldemort look exceedingly silly.</p>\n<p>And it reports that he\u2019s a Parselmouth. Harry sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you so displeased, sir? Did the story lie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glares harder at James, who\u2019s given up and is laughing quietly into his hand. \u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. But it means that people will be looking harder at me as some lone hero to save them. That\u2019s <em>not </em>what needs to happen, Mr. Potter. People need to stand up for themselves, or fear is still going to rule them. If they put too much faith in me and I fall\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019re all fucked,\u201d James says, dropping his hands from his face. He looks entirely serious.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mr. Potter. </em>Your <em>language.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that to me.\u201d James\u2019s voice is low, intense, and Harry suffers a brief sensation of what he probably sounded like when he stood up to Voldemort in the other timeline, defending Harry and his mother. \u201cYou know very well that it\u2019s not just us who would be fucked-over. The people who aren\u2019t doing anything about Voldemort won\u2019t do anything even if you try to encourage them. Headmaster Dumbledore isn\u2019t doing enough, but some people still depend on him. You\u2019re our choice, Professor. I don\u2019t know how or why, or where you came from, but you need to take the lead. And you need to use any weapon at your disposal to take out that sorry bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry narrows his eyes, but it\u2019s nothing more than Severus already told him, if phrased somewhat differently. \u201cWere we at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter, I would take <em>so</em> many points from Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know truth-telling was an offense, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes, and James grins again.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t take the oaths of twelve-year-olds,\u201d Harry says, and he frankly doesn\u2019t care how harsh his voice is right now. He needs to discourage this\u2014this nonsense. \u201cThe youngest person I\u2019ve allowed to swear to me was fourteen at the time. So put your wand away and get out of my classroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m almost thirteen!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gives in to the temptation to shut his eyes and just inhale and exhale for a moment. He supposes it\u2019s a just punishment, for his sins, that the first Ravenclaw to decide to approach him to swear an oath is Gilderoy Bloody Lockhart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could be an asset,\u201d Lockhart adds, obviously proud of the word that he probably learned from someone else.</p>\n<p><em>I hope he didn\u2019t Obliviate that person, too, </em>Harry thinks crossly. But he manages to open his eyes and smile at Lockhart. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Mr. Lockhart. But I\u2019m not doing this for assets. I\u2019m swearing oaths to protect people who need protection. Do you need protection?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lockhart takes a full minute to ponder that. Then he sighs and puts his wand away. \u201cNo, sir. But if I did, you would let me swear my oath?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would protect you. But I meant what I said about not taking the oaths of twelve-year-olds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be thir\u2014\u201d Lockhart catches Harry\u2019s eye and evidently decides that he doesn\u2019t need to repeat it. \u201cRight,\u201d he says faintly, and then turns around and leaves.</p>\n<p>Harry leans back in his chair and massages his temples.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone intimidating children for the day, Henry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus is lingering in his doorway, because of course he is. Harry is frankly a little surprised that Albus didn\u2019t approach him right after the Christmas holiday ended, but maybe it took the man a while to decide on what he wanted to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone teaching,\u201d Harry says, and motions Albus to a chair in front of the desk while locking the door. He doesn\u2019t have to be available right now, and there\u2019s still half an hour to dinner.</p>\n<p>Harry does hope that whatever Albus wants to say to him will be finished by then, because otherwise there\u2019s a pack of Slytherins and Gryffindors who will probably come looking for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I like what you\u2019re turning the children at this school into,\u201d Albus begins, conjuring a chair for himself the way he did at the Board of Governors\u2019 meeting instead of taking a desk. Harry figures that\u2019s a psychological ploy so that he doesn\u2019t look like a child. It slides off Harry like water off brick. \u201cOr what you\u2019re turning yourself into?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh, the direct approach. </em>\u201cProtectors? People who watch out for each other?\u201d Harry frowns and leans forwards to look into Albus\u2019s face without making direct eye contact that would give him some purchase for Legilimency. \u201cI\u2019m concerned, Headmaster. If you think that I shouldn\u2019t be doing that, then I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re the right person to hold the office that you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus breaks out into spluttering, of course, and Harry sits back with a little smile, watching. Albus gets control of himself, and says, \u201cI did not mean that. I mean that children should not be involved in war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are, whether or not they want to be. Mr. Rosier\u2019s father would have Marked him as the slave of a madman. Mr. Black\u2019s parents were similarly prepared to sacrifice him. And you didn\u2019t seem to be singing the same tune when you were talking about having Mr. Potter and Mr. Black the elder join your Order of the Phoenix.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus frowns at him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have involved them in the activities of the war while they were still underage. Only had them spy, gather intelligence\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow? Or <em>were </em>you going to ask them to become Marked Death Eaters?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not! Mr. Potter is extraordinarily good at sneaking around the school without being seen. I would have asked him to gather some intelligence from Death Eaters\u2019 children for me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>By \u201cextraordinarily good at sneaking around the school,\u201d you mean he has an Invisibility Cloak. </em>Harry shakes his head. \u201cNot all Death Eaters\u2019 children want to become Death Eaters. I believe I just mentioned a few instances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey might still have valuable things to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they did, I would know about them. Did it occur to you to ask me?\u201d Harry demands, thoroughly exasperated. \u201cOr to ask someone who\u2019s <em>out </em>of school and committed to resisting Voldemort?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus opens his mouth, then shuts it again. \u201cI cannot trust what you are doing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are building an army, and they are as loyal as any Death Eater.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes at the ceiling. \u201cSo you can only trust yourself to lead an army of students,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can only trust Gryffindors. You can only trust yourself to resist Voldemort. Did I miss anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot trust someone who takes so much <em>glee </em>in breaking up families.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d Harry asks softly. \u201cWhen did you try to get students families who would protect them, Albus? You sent Tom Riddle back to the Muggles again and again. You would have seen Mr. Rosier Marked. Were you intending to use him as a spy? Is <em>that </em>why you\u2019re upset that I interfered?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus looks so outraged that it takes him a long moment to find his tongue. \u201cI would not have sacrificed someone like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Tom Riddle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not Headmaster when Mr. Riddle was a student here. I had no power to allow him to stay in the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had the same power I have now. I\u2019m not Headmaster, either. You could have sworn an oath to him, or even just checked up on him. Instead, you denied him the ability to get to safety. In the middle of a <em>war.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus flinches, which Harry would take as a victory if he didn\u2019t think that Albus flinched more because he was thinking about the man who had led part of that war rather than the child Tom Riddle. \u201cYou do not know what he was like, even as a child\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know some.\u201d Harry raises his eyebrows at Albus. \u201cI know that you seem to have decided he needed to be punished for stealing the belongings of others. I agree that that doesn\u2019t promise a good future, but why was <em>punishment </em>the first thought in your head, instead of trying to guide him onto a moral path?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know these things?\u201d Albus sounds horrified, subdued.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter as much as your answer to my question.\u2019</p>\n<p>Albus looks away. Harry waits. Albus finally says, \u201cI thought that punishment <em>would </em>set him on the moral path. No one among the Muggles in that orphanage could stand up to him. He needed to be shown the errors of his ways, and that there were people in the world stronger than he was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harry says, with a long sigh. \u201cNow I think I understand the basis of so much of your reasoning, and it\u2019s not reasoning that I would want to expose my own students to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you intend to challenge me to a duel, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus\u2019s voice is soft, but his hand tightens at his side, and Harry knows that he\u2019s an inch away from grasping his wand. Harry laughs loudly in response. Albus blinks and sits back in his conjured chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m focused on my students and on Voldemort. That\u2019s enough challenges for any man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to understand that I\u2019m not your bloody enemy, Albus. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not your bloody follower or rival, either. I\u2019ve told you what my goals are. If you have to distrust me because of that\u2026what, why? Because I don\u2019t do exactly what you want when you want it? I\u2019ll tell you something, neither does the <em>army </em>of students you think I\u2019m building.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus hesitates for a long time. Finally, he speaks. \u201cAt one point I made a horrible mistake by trusting someone who was charming and seemed aligned with my goals on the surface, and I\u2019m not the one who paid the price for that mistake. It was other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have known that this would go back to your guilt complex over Grindelwald,\u201d Harry murmurs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of falling in love with you and trying to kill your sister. Or, well, it would have to be your brother, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus rises to his feet. \u201cI want to know how you know this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t covered your tracks as well as you thought you did,\u201d Harry says gently, and watches Albus turn and stalk out of the room. Then he permits himself to sigh.</p>\n<p>This goes back to Albus\u2019s fear of making another mistake, of trusting the wrong person and getting some other innocent killed. At least Harry knows it\u2019s not going to crop up as a personal animosity in the future. Albus will just do his best to sabotage Harry in other ways.</p>\n<p>And that probably shouldn\u2019t be comforting, but hey, he always feels better when he understands something.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cRiddle wants me to serve in place of my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you mean as more than just someone who\u2019s Marked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius grimaces and nods, picking up the glass of Firewhisky Harry poured when Harry nudges it pointedly towards him. \u201cYes. He\u2014well, he got the idea that my father won\u2019t be released from Ministry custody any time soon. I personally believe that Father is prolonging his stay in the holding cells so that he doesn\u2019t have to face Riddle and pay for his failure.\u201d He throws back some of the Firewhisky, and then chokes and coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlowly, Mr. Malfoy. I think your fianc\u00e9e would pay someone to murder me if I killed you, or perhaps just come do the deed herself.\u201d Harry smiles a little when Lucius does, although Lucius\u2019s expression fades almost at once. \u201cNow. How did the other Death Eaters take the revelation of my Parseltongue?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeveral of them have quietly disappeared,\u201d Lucius says with satisfaction. \u201cOthers are claiming increased family duties at the meetings we have, and thus lack of general ability to respond to the call. I don\u2019t think any of them are the kind who will come to you and ask to have their Marks made inactive or replaced, but at least we\u2019re depriving him of followers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even know that I <em>could</em> render their Marks inactive, so there\u2019s no reason for them to come to me.\u201d And that\u2019s the way he likes it. He wants to maintain the lives of innocents, but he sees no reason to take committed Death Eaters under his protection, so he\u2019ll protect innocents by removing them from the killing field. \u201cAnd Riddle himself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone quiet, my lord, which I don\u2019t like. I think he\u2019s planning a more involved trap than the one that snared Regulus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Harry says grimly. \u201cListen, Lucius. There\u2019s something I wanted you to look for, if you can do it without danger to yourself, in the Malfoy library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA book that you need to defeat him, my lord?\u201d Lucius puts down the Firewhisky and sits up. \u201cI\u2019ll be honored to do whatever I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo things. First, stop calling me \u2018my lord.\u2019\u201d Harry waits until he gets a nod, although an unconvinced one, and then goes on. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a book, yes, but not a book of lore. It\u2019s an artifact that Riddle might have given your father. A small black book with the initials T. M. R. stamped on the front.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly <em>might </em>have given my father, my l\u2014sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he has or not. It\u2019s possible that Riddle moved it. It\u2019s a precious artifact to him, something he can use to strengthen his power as he did during the trap when he built the fire-cage. Don\u2019t touch it with your bare skin, whatever you do. You might find yourself compelled to open it and write in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that would be disastrous.\u201d Lucius nods without asking for any more verification. \u201cI can look for it, sir. I\u2019ve moved out of the house, but it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for me to come back and search for something I needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry relaxes with a loud sigh. \u201cGood.\u201d This is both a way to let Lucius feel like he\u2019s doing something useful and the easiest way to get the Horcrux, if it is there. Riddle might or might not know that Harry is hunting the Horcruxes specifically. He will if he\u2019s gone to the island and found the ring missing, but on the other hand, he might think that Harry used the Fiendfyre snakes just to destroy a pair of power-boosting artifacts, not destroy pieces of his soul.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucius hesitates, and Harry makes an impatient little twirling motion of his hand at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m that obvious, am I?\u201d Lucius smiles, but it\u2019s largely without humor. \u201cSeverus told me about how you drew on Regulus\u2019s power to save him from the trap, and suggested that you might be able to do the same thing with any of the people you swore oaths with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Harry says, as calmly and neutrally as he can. \u201cI would only do it if I had to, though, or if we managed to set up a trap for Voldemort where it would be useful. It\u2019s not a pleasant experience for either one of the people in the link.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegulus says that he was thrilled to be able to do something to help in his own escape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve laid out my conditions clearly, Mr. Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius shakes his head a little sadly. \u201cAll right.\u201d He drains the last of the Firewhisky and stands. \u201cIf you change your mind, please realize that Narcissa and I will both be honored to stand with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods to him, and escorts him to the Floo. Then he goes back to his chair and stares, brooding, into the fire.</p>\n<p>Ravenclaw\u2019s diadem isn\u2019t in the Room of Requirement, and Harry has checked, thoroughly. He doesn\u2019t know how Voldemort could have got in and removed it, but then again, he moved his locket before last summer. Perhaps he came to the castle in some kind of disguise during the holidays and took it.</p>\n<p>And the blood splatters on the page that Harry is trying to get the location of the Horcruxes from aren\u2019t cooperating.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs, and goes to bed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease come with me, Mr. Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods and falls into step with his fellow Unspeakable. They sent him an owl yesterday to tell him that they\u2019ve made some progress on the research into what happens when a prophecy is disrupted by someone coming back to before the birth of one of the participants in it, and where that person might not be born again in a different form, either. Harry thinks that they\u2019ll go to the Time Chamber.</p>\n<p>Instead, they go to the room that contains the prophecy orbs. Harry pauses a moment in deference to his own memories, and to let the humming fill something in his head.</p>\n<p>He feels wistful. This was the room where he spent a few months studying before he came back through time, although he didn\u2019t find a definitive answer to the question that he asked his colleagues to research, either (not a surprise when he was studying the shards of the orbs instead of the orbs themselves). He can think of Ron and Hermione and Sirius as he used to be as he stands here.</p>\n<p>But he puts the thoughts aside as he did years ago. When he decided that the second war had wrought too much harm to their world\u2014and he did\u2014then he put aside all thought of remaining with his friends. He\u2019s lost them. He\u2019s lost the life he was living. A decade of research preparing to go back in time has reconciled him to that loss as much as he can be.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis way, Mr. Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pauses when he comes to a mostly empty shelf. It\u2019s not the one that held the old prophecy about him and Riddle, at least as far as he can remember. In fact, there\u2019s only a tiny spark of light on the shelf that doesn\u2019t look like a prophecy orb at all. He wonders if this is some experimental spell that the Unspeakables need him to interact with.</p>\n<p>Then he gets closer, and catches his breath.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a <em>tiny </em>prophecy orb, one that is growing like a plant from a seed.</p>\n<p>He stares at the cloaked figure next to him, and the man, or woman, nods. \u201cYes, Mr. Salvare,\u201d they say. \u201cA new prophecy is forming. It\u2019s too small to hear yet, and I don\u2019t think that even you could truly touch it. But you are welcome to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reaches out and passes his hand through the orb. He can feel a little warmth, but nothing solid. He settles back with a sigh. \u201cThis is\u2014does this <em>happen</em>? I thought that prophecy orbs could only form after a prophecy has actually been spoken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFew people who are the subject of prophecies have traveled in time,\u201d the Unspeakable says simply. \u201cAnd fewer have caused such enormous changes that are close to their original role once they have gone back in time.\u201d They tilt their head a little, and Harry does, too, to listen to the chimes ringing out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Harry says, as he stares at the orb. It\u2019s too small to make out the writing on it, either, only that there is some. That surprises him, but if a prophecy can come into being by itself, why can\u2019t it label itself, too? \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I come through? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius\u2019s midnight Floo call is a surprise, and so is his hurried whisper through the fire. Then again, if he has the diary, he might not have much time before Voldemort realizes it\u2019s missing, or he might be wary of holding onto it when he knows that it can corrupt him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Harry gestures with his wand, and the protections on the Floo dissipate. He was already awake. His oath-bond to Lucius has been jangling and ringing for the last hour. He longed to go to Lucius\u2019s side, but he held still because of how faint the warning was. Lucius might only have been in danger because he was picking up the diary or had to spin some tale to Voldemort about why he was in Malfoy Manor\u2019s library. Harry showing up could have done more harm than good.</p>\n<p>Lucius sighs and steps through the Floo, dusting himself off thoroughly. He glances around and swallows. \u201cYou\u2014you promise that we\u2019ll be alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we will.\u201d Maybe Harry was wrong and the danger related to some Death Eater meeting Lucius was at, rather than the diary. \u201cDo you have the book I asked you to find?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius shakes his head. \u201cThis is something else. I have to make sure that we won\u2019t be disturbed, though. The consequences if this gets out\u2026\u201d He shudders.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise that we won\u2019t be.\u201d Harry raises a few extra wards on the door to make sure, although it\u2019s rare for even his oathsworn to disturb him in his quarters. They\u2019re more likely to come to him in his office. \u201cNow, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns straight into a powerful Stunner. Harry collapses to the floor, fighting for breath, not quite unconscious. It\u2019s difficult for the wands of his oathsworn to hurt him.</p>\n<p><em>But not impossible, </em>Harry thinks as he watches the Polyjuice disguise melt and shift from Lucius\u2019s face, <em>if they\u2019re wielded by someone else. </em></p>\n<p>He feels like he should have known that it wasn\u2019t Lucius. The bastard never once tried to call him by a title.</p>\n<p>Voldemort bends down towards Harry and laughs once, a sibilant dark sound. \u201c<em>I think it will be difficult for anyone else to find you, where I am taking you,</em>\u201d he says, and a Portkey grabs Harry as it did once, long ago.</p>\n<p>The chimes as he flies through space are muted, but insistent, there.</p>\n<p><em>If history is repeating itself, that means I live, </em>Harry thinks grimly, and readies himself as best he can for what\u2019s to come.</p>\n<p>They land in an oddly-shaped cell, or rather, Voldemort lands on the lip of a ledge above him, and Harry crashes down into a capsule-shaped lower stone chamber. He groans as his head bounces off the wall. The stone is so tight around his body, made to fit him, that he can\u2019t even move his arms to draw his wand or get a surprise out of his robes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMade to fit you, Professor Salvare.\u201d Voldemort cackles at him and leans against the wall behind him. They appear to be at the bottom of a giant stone well, since Harry can see a glimpse of daylight far above him. \u201cYou did me more favors than you knew by taking Lucius Malfoy\u2019s allegiance from me. I ripped all sorts of information out of his head, including detailed memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legilimency. Damn it. I thought Lucius\u2019s Occlumency was strong enough, but it wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand up to a determined assault from someone so strong. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry ignores Voldemort and concentrates on his bond to Lucius. It\u2019s quiescent, which probably means Lucius is unconscious, but still there. He sighs. The muted jangling from earlier makes sense now. Voldemort probably learned about some of the effects of the oaths from Lucius\u2019s memories, so he acted carefully to avoid putting Lucius in danger that would have alerted Harry.</p>\n<p>At least that means that Lucius is probably wounded in a way he can recover from.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pay attention to me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I don\u2019t see a reason to,</em>\u201d Harry says honestly. \u201c<em>I know that you brought me here to kill me or torture me. Or kill me after torturing me. You\u2019re not going to say anything interesting.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort stares at him with his eyes widening further and further, and then he grips his wand and points it at him. Harry braces himself for the Cruciatus.</p>\n<p>Instead, Voldemort lowers his wand. \u201c<em>I wish you to tell me where you learned Parseltongue.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort nods as if he expected the answer, and then turns and gestures with his wand towards the stone wall. Harry expects the alcove that opens to reveal some kind of gleaming torture instruments.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t. Instead, it shows Lucius on a flat pallet, his arms and legs bound to the point that he won\u2019t be able to move any more than Harry can and his hand bare of his ring. Harry tenses and instinctively lunges for him, but the press of the stone trap around his body holds him in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I thought that would get you,\u201d Voldemort says, in English this time. \u201cSuch a weakness, to be bound to the ones who follow you.\u201d His eyes glint, and he smiles. \u201cMy way is a much better one of handling it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it makes your followers as eager to turn on you as Lucius was? When it makes people fight to swear to me instead of going to you?\u201d Harry laughs. He doesn\u2019t mind saying this, now that Voldemort definitely knows that Lucius is no longer a Death Eater. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t see it as a weakness at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort\u2019s humor flees. He stalks forwards to the edge of the stone he stands on, and hisses threateningly, \u201c<em>You will tell me where you learned Parseltongue, or I will torture him.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The oath leaps between Harry and Lucius like a living thing, anticipating pain. Harry bites his tongue to curb the words he wants to say to Voldemort, and instead simply says, \u201c<em>I\u2019ve had Parseltongue ever since I can remember. I didn\u2019t learn it. I can just speak it.</em>\u201d There, that\u2019s all true, and will sound so to Voldemort\u2019s Legilimency.</p>\n<p>Voldemort stares at him in silence, eyes tracing back and forth as if thinks there\u2019s a secret map to another answer behind Harry\u2019s face. Harry, meanwhile, relaxes as much as he can and reaches out for his other followers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to be hard, from a distance, and with so many of them asleep. But he has to. He has to rescue Lucius, and he has to get out of here, and he can\u2019t use Lucius\u2019s magic when he\u2019s unconscious and can\u2019t willingly open the bond from his side.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Are you another descendant of Slytherin?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort sounds uncertain, as if he hates having his claim to being \u201cspecial\u201d challenged. Harry gives him a faint smile. \u201c<em>If I am, it\u2019s from a much less direct line than you are. Somewhere far back and tangled.</em>\u201d That\u2019s also true.</p>\n<p>Voldemort nods, and his arrogant smile comes back. \u201c<em>I want you to tell me what you did with my ring.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Shit, he does know. </em>Harry forces himself to return Voldemort\u2019s gaze as calmly as he can, and keep reaching for the magic. Regulus is awake now, and feeding him magic, and Severus and Evan are coming awake. James is stirring. Sirius has snapped awake and is wondering what\u2019s going on. Lily has lifted her head. She\u2019ll probably figure it out in a minute, if only because drawing on the oath-link between them will make her remember the moment she swore to him, and that can begin opening it. \u201c<em>I destroyed it.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort\u2019s eyes flare with madness, and he turns and unleashes the Cruciatus Curse on Lucius without breaking stride.</p>\n<p>Harry screams in fury, and a distant echo of Lucius\u2019s pain, and recklessly seizes the magic coming from his followers. Five links are fully open now, between him and Regulus, Severus, Evan, Sirius, and Lily, and then there comes another flood of cool magic that seems to have just been waiting for him to access it. <em>Narcissa, </em>says a voice in his head like a sigh of her name.</p>\n<p>And Lucius, incredibly, awake and screaming now, concentrates enough to open the link between him and Harry.</p>\n<p>Seven is the most powerful magical number.</p>\n<p>Harry grabs the power and lashes out with it as hard as he can, and the capsule-shaped tomb explodes around him. Voldemort lets Lucius go from the Cruciatus Curse in his shock, and Harry scrambles up and reaches for his wand.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not there.</p>\n<p>Voldemort levels his yew wand at Harry, but Harry doesn\u2019t have time for a complicated game of duels and shields and the like. He clenches his fingers and yanks down, and the ledge beneath Voldemort crumbles and falls.</p>\n<p>Lucius is forcing himself up on his elbows and knees, or trying to, but the ropes get in the way. Harry glances at him and flicks a single, precise blade of magic, composed mostly of Lucius\u2019s power and Narcissa\u2019s, and the ropes are severed. Lucius gasps and manages to stagger up, although he\u2019s bracing himself with a hand on the side of the alcove Voldemort had him imprisoned in.</p>\n<p>Voldemort, meanwhile, fell several feet when the ledge crumbled beneath him, but now he\u2019s hovering in midair, the same way he flew when he came after Harry and other people disguised as him so long ago. He snarls at Harry and points his wand at the jagged shards of rock Harry is still standing among.</p>\n<p>Harry lifts the shards before Voldemort can and spins them into a temporary, floating shield, then shouts, \u201c<em>Accio </em>holly wand!\u201d</p>\n<p>The wand tears Voldemort\u2019s robe pocket open as it flies towards him, and stings Harry\u2019s palm when it smacks into it. But Harry can\u2019t pay that much attention to the slight pain, not when Voldemort\u2019s first curse is reverberating off the shards of stone and Harry knows he\u2019s going to get another one any second.</p>\n<p>He casts a Cushioning Charm beneath him and uses the warm magic flowing through his chest to make it flexible. As Voldemort again tries to curse him, Harry bends down and then leaps as high as he can.</p>\n<p>He comes down and bounces off the flexible Cushioning Charm as if it\u2019s a giant invisible trampoline, meaning Voldemort\u2019s curse once again misses him. Harry lands on a broken piece in the rock wall beneath Lucius\u2019s alcove, and lifts his glance to him.</p>\n<p>Lucius understands what he wants, and scrambles to the edge of the alcove. Harry conjures a rope and flings it to him. Lucius grabs the other end as Harry touches the rope with his wand and begins the spell to make it into a Portkey.</p>\n<p>Voldemort screams and flies straight towards them.</p>\n<p>Harry spins to face him, but doesn\u2019t take his wand off the rope. Instead, he uses the same invisible force of wild magic that broke the rock around him to raise a shield of ice, and Voldemort slams into it, going too fast to stop. That leave shards of ice all over the floor of the well, but it leaves a stunned Voldemort, too.</p>\n<p>Just in case, Harry takes a chance and calls, \u201c<em>Accio </em>Tom Riddle\u2019s diary!\u201d as he lifts his wand from the rope.</p>\n<p>But nothing happens. It seems that Voldemort <em>was </em>smart enough not to bring a Horcrux with him to this confrontation.</p>\n<p>Voldemort screams at him again. Harry decides that he and Lucius need to leave right now, and clenches his hand around the rope.</p>\n<p>One more spell tears towards him as they Portkey away, and Harry grimaces as he feels it clip his shoulder. He would have to see a Healer anyway after being dropped on stone like that and draining people\u2019s magic.</p>\n<p>As they slump to the floor in his quarters and Lucius starts shaking beside him, however, Harry forces that thought away, and tamps down his pressure on the links with his oathsworn until he\u2019s taking only a small bit of their magic. He needs to get Lucius to the infirmary, and he needs to make sure that he\u2019s in a safe place before he falls apart. He\u2019ll need a bit of power for that, but nothing like the enormous surge that got him out of trouble with Voldemort.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, however, he sends thanks down the links as best as he can. He thinks he gets a few exhausted assents, before some of his people drop into sleep right where they stand.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve escaped. They\u2019ve survived.</p>\n<p>And from now on, Harry is going to have to be more vigilant than ever that Voldemort can\u2019t grab any of his people.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI really do need your full report, Professor Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I told you before that I don\u2019t give reports, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t look away from the Healer that a young Madam Pomfrey summoned from St. Mungo\u2019s to attend to him. Apparently Lucius is going to be all right other than a few pulled muscles and bones. Voldemort didn\u2019t hold him under the curse long enough to cause permanent damage. Still, he\u2019ll need to rest in the infirmary.</p>\n<p>And the Healer is for <em>him</em>. Harry tried to tell Madam Pomfrey that he would be all right, that it was mostly magical exhaustion and the like, but she pointed her wand at him and gave him a huge frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re barely on your feet, professor, and that mostly because of the way your vassals\u2019 magic is cradling you. When you let it go, you\u2019re going to collapse. And I wager that you\u2019ll let it go sooner instead of later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry did. But at least with the Healer there, he got a Pepper-Up Potion and a pain-killing potion right away. Right now the Healer is casting general diagnostic spells and shaking his head as he watches the numbers and runes pile up in the air. He\u2019s a young man with dark hair that\u2019s pulled back into a tail and intense blue eyes, called Isaac Hawken.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that you don\u2019t have a concussion,\u201d says Hawken, with a sharp glance Harry\u2019s way. \u201cIf you\u2019re right and he dropped you onto stone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did. But I didn\u2019t fall that far, maybe a meter or so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no <em>good </em>distance from which to fall onto stone. <em>Professor </em>Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grins. It\u2019s kind of refreshing that Healer Hawken is showing so clearly that he\u2019s unimpressed with him. He can just guess the response that he\u2019s going to get from some of his oathsworn. Regulus, in particular, is going to be a combination of reverent and smug.</p>\n<p>(Harry can just hear him now: \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you it was a good idea to have Lucius Malfoy serve you? Didn\u2019t I?\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you should be all right with a few more pain potions and some <em>rest </em>and <em>food</em>.\u201d Healer Hawken stresses the words as if he doesn\u2019t think Harry knows what they mean, gives him one more deeply unimpressed look, and then closes the small book he\u2019s been writing in and departs with a shake of his head. Harry lies back on the hospital bed and sighs as Madam Pomfrey waves her wand over him and goes to get some potions for his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>must </em>insist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes at Albus. \u201cVoldemort thought that he could get to me by capturing and torturing one of my people. I broke free of the trap, and luckily rescued Mr. Malfoy before he could be hurt too badly.\u201d He shoots Lucius a concerned look, but he\u2019s deeply asleep and shows no sign, at the moment, of whether he\u2019s in pain or not. Narcissa is sitting beside Lucius\u2019s bed, her hand clasped around his and her other arm wrapped around her chest as if she\u2019s trying to prevent her heart from escaping. She watches Harry and Albus with cool, curious eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>how </em>did you break free?\u201d Albus asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus gives him a deeply disappointed look, but that kind of thing ceased to be effective on Harry some time ago. He stares back evenly, and Albus gets up and does the next thing to storming out of the hospital wing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for saving his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turns back to Narcissa. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m sorry that he was caught up in this in the first place. You\u2019re welcome to move to Decoy House, if you want to, to stay safe from Voldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa bites her lip. \u201cYes. We\u2019re going to do that.\u201d She turns to stare at Lucius, and her hand clenches until Harry can see her knuckles turning white. \u201cI do not know what I can say to thank you enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head. \u201cWithout you and the others, I never would have escaped that trap. That\u2019s enough thanks, or, if you like, you can say that people who swear oaths to each other and mutually save one another\u2019s lives don\u2019t owe each other debts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI owe you for more than simply saving my fianc\u00e9, however,\u201d Narcissa murmurs. \u201cI owe you for saving the father of my child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t help his mouth dropping open. He had no idea that Narcissa was pregnant. She certainly never had any child but Draco in the first timeline.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps she had one and miscarried, or they died young. It\u2019s not as though Harry would have been close enough to <em>that </em>version of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014see. I hope, then, that the magic I used from you didn\u2019t endanger you or the child?\u201d Harry isn\u2019t going to apologize for using it at all, even though he would have preferred to call on someone else if he\u2019d known that Narcissa was pregnant. She would probably get angry that he was apologizing for something she just said she owed him a debt for.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We are well.\u201d Narcissa smiles him and glances at Lucius. \u201cAnd I am going to marry him as soon as he rises up from this bed.\u201d She hesitates, and Harry waits through Madam Pomfrey coming back and casting some more diagnostic spells. Narcissa only continues once the matron\u2019s office door continues. \u201cWe would like your name to be part of his, if it is a son. Or even if it is a daughter. I think Henrietta is a lovely name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry bites his lip fiercely to keep from bursting into hysterical laughter that might wake Lucius up. Instead, he nods. \u201cI would be honored.\u201d What else can he <em>say</em>?</p>\n<p>Narcissa turns back to Lucius with a final, pallid smile in his direction, and Harry closes his eyes. He should rest, and not just because of the magical exhaustion that is going to fall on him like a mudslide soon. He can\u2019t take any more surprises this evening, he really can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t much like walking into the Great Hall to a torrent of applause, either, but he knew he couldn\u2019t count on his oathsworn to keep this quiet.</p>\n<p>Harry bows the way he did when he gave his people their rings for Christmas, deliberately showy and comical to undercut what might be burgeoning hero-worship as much as he can, and walks towards the Head Table. A few people rise from the Slytherin table as if they\u2019re going to either escort him or guard him in some absurd way, and Harry narrows his eyes. They sit down again, hastily.</p>\n<p>But they\u2019re all grinning, which he knows means they know the limits of his tolerance.</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head, snorts, and takes his seat at the Head Table. Professor Slughorn immediately leans over to him. He\u2019s acted unsure about Harry before this, especially since Harry seems to have more influence among the students of his House than he does, but now he\u2019s no doubt decided Harry is someone to be cultivated. Harry can welcome that. At least <em>someone </em>is acting the way he expects them to act.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would like to invite you to the next Slug Club party,\u201d Slughorn burbles, his eyes bright. \u201cJust a little gathering of eighty or so of my closest friends\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lets him go on and on, only nodding or making appropriate noises in the right places. He\u2019s watching Sirius, who seems to be arguing with Remus about something. When Sirius jumps to his feet and stomps dramatically out of the Great Hall, Harry decides to investigate.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut me down as an attendee,\u201d he says, and stands up, smiling at Slughorn. \u201cBut right now, I really must go and get some marking done before classes start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou barely ate anything.\u201d No one does a disapproving stare like Minerva McGonagall, no matter the timeline or how old Harry is.</p>\n<p>Harry scoops up his plate, winks at her, and sets off after Sirius.</p>\n<p>He runs him to ground on the staircase that leads up to the Defense classroom. Sirius whips around and then relaxes. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Professor Salvare,\u201d he says, running his hand through his hair and then staring at it as if he doesn\u2019t know where it came from.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the warmest welcome ever, but Harry will take it. He gives Sirius a small smile. \u201cDid you have an argument with Mr. Lupin, Mr. Black?\u201d he asks, guiding both of them towards the classroom and taking a large bite of the eggs on his plate. He really <em>is </em>still hungry, just not enough to ignore someone in need.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014Remus was giving me a line of bollocks about why he has to join Dumbledore\u2019s Order instead of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t <em>have </em>to join either,\u201d Harry says judiciously as they get to the classroom and he motions Sirius inside. Sirius slumps miserably over his desk, and Harry sits down next to him instead of going to the front of the classroom. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s time for that right now. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see him pressured into doing either one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think that the Slytherins will be happy if he joins you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. \u201cIf you and Mr. Potter can be on your best behavior, I don\u2019t see why it would be impossible for Mr. Lupin. I would have the same rules for him as for the rest of you, no pranks or fights against\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sirius gives him an agonized look, then breathes in like someone jumping off a cliff. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll accept him because it might come out that he\u2019s a werewolf. It would be harder to hide that he\u2019s sick on the full moons if they were around him more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Sirius is imitating someone who doesn\u2019t breathe at <em>all</em>. Harry just shakes his head and spears another bite of egg. \u201cHe should tell me if anyone has concerns about that. I\u2019ll explain how it\u2019s none of their business as long as Mr. Lupin isn\u2019t loose in his transformed state around them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s voice is a little faint. Harry winks at him. \u201cNo, I already trusted him.\u201d He studies Sirius\u2019s face and then calls a house-elf named Irry from the kitchens whose specialty is shoving food in people. Sirius jumps when she appears, and more so when the plate of scones and marmalade appears in front of him, despite having heard what Harry asked Irry for. \u201cNow, you can tell him that, or I can talk to him if you think that would make it better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius attacks the scones with the knife that appears next to his plate a second later. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019s intimidated by you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowns. \u201cReally?\u201d Remus is a quiet student in class, but from what Harry\u2019s heard the other professors saying, he\u2019s that way naturally.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sirius swallows with an absurd smacking noise that makes Harry narrow his eyes at him, which makes Sirius just grin. \u201cHe says that he doesn\u2019t understand you, that you smell older than you look, that you smell like James and you don\u2019t, and that your magic is too complex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Harry shrugs. He supposes that his scent might confuse a werewolf, yes. He probably smells a little like James and a little like Lily and not enough like either. \u201cWell, talk to him, but I want you to promise me that you won\u2019t pressure him to swear an oath to me, either. He has to make his own choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHalf the reason he wants to join the Order of the Phoenix is that he wants to make a difference and doesn\u2019t know how else he can. But he thinks that even that depends on keeping his secret, and he\u2019s terrified of doing something that\u2019ll betray him.\u201d Sirius gestures with his scone, and sends marmalade flipping onto another desk. \u201cUm. Oops?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a wand, Mr. Black, clean it up,\u201d Harry says in some amusement, and rises to go to his desk and start setting up for his first-year class.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glances over his shoulder, because Sirius sounds as grave as his name. \u201cYes, Mr. Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles at him. \u201cAnd thank <em>you</em>, Mr. Black, for your timely assistance last night. That you responded so quickly and that your brother was also in the sharing made it more powerful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s chest expands enough to make him look as if he\u2019s about to float right off the floor. Harry snorts and watches him strut out the door. Sirius strutting isn\u2019t a bad thing, as long as he doesn\u2019t take his humor out on someone. And Harry really does think that having to refrain from pranks for a month last term has set him and James on a more adult, thoughtful path.</p>\n<p>The first-years start to filter in, and give him awed looks. Harry sighs a little. <em>That </em>is one thing that could stand to calm down.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry settles back in his chair and scowls at the parchment with the blood splatters. It isn\u2019t making <em>sense. </em>He can see the places where the Horcruxes <em>ought </em>to be, but nothing shows up in those empty spaces on the graph.</p>\n<p>He drums his fingers on the desk and growls under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a minute, my lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flips Severus off without looking up from the parchment, which makes Severus pause and stare at him. Harry knows that without meeting his eyes. \u201cAlways,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not for people who call me lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus audibly rolls his eyes, and takes a seat hesitantly at one of the desks. It\u2019s late, later than Harry would usually stay in his office even if students needed him, but he can afford a little lingering now. He has been trying to patiently answer questions from students who seem to hold him in awe, and who he would prefer see him as just a regular person.</p>\n<p>He might not <em>be </em>a regular person, but they shouldn\u2019t feel awe towards him. That\u2019s where Harry draws the line. Wanting to follow him, wanting his protection, wanting to know how to cast spells better in his class\u2026sure, he can see all that. But awe and worship make a part of him spit like a cobra.</p>\n<p>Harry tries to triangulate the position of the diary and the diadem again, and finally gives up, shaking his head in disgust. He sits back, throwing down his quill, and smiles wearily at Severus. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Harry says. \u201cBut did you forget that you helped me a <em>lot</em>, not a fortnight past?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus smiles, which seems to be against his will, considering the dark look he immediately tries to marshal after that. \u201cI mean that we want to help you with whatever quest you\u2019re on to defeat the Dark Lord. Lily told me that she thought it involved Arithmancy, and I can see it does.\u201d He nods at the parchment spread across Harry\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would let you help if it wouldn\u2019t involve you knowing things the Dark Lord would kill you for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wants to kill us anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaces. That\u2019s probably true, considering Voldemort\u2019s frantic attacks on the followers Harry has outside of school. Andromeda and her family have moved to Decoy House to join Narcissa and Lucius, and a few people who haven\u2019t sworn oaths to Harry but have spoken up in his favor are sheltering behind wards somewhere.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Harry is expecting Voldemort to work up the nerve for an attack on Hogwarts sooner or later, probably before this school year is over.</p>\n<p>Time hums at him from the walls, soft and yearning. Harry gives them a dark look. If Time intends to repeat the Battle of Hogwarts, then Harry intends to kick Time\u2019s arse.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right, sir? Only\u2026I don\u2019t see what the walls have done to deserve the way you look at them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chuckles reluctantly and turns back to Severus. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mr. Prince. One of my peculiarities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus clenches his fists. \u201c<em>Please </em>let us help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this your idea, or everyone\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey asked me to come and speak to you, but I was already thinking about it.\u201d Severus\u2019s eyes have a sharp, impatient spark in them that reminds Harry, a little, of the way that he once looked at Potions students, in a world that is no more. \u201cI\u2019m good at Arithmancy. Lily is a genius at it. And even Lucius wasn\u2019t bad in his day. There are a few other Slytherins who could help, too. If you need us to contribute magical strength, or just research time, we can do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn top of your studies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our NEWT year,\u201d Severus says, as if that really makes a difference. \u201cRegulus hasn\u2019t done as much as he did last term because of his OWLS, but you have a whole host of people who want to follow you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this just because you fear Voldemort? Or for some other reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe some people are blinded by their hero-worship of you, but I have eyes,\u201d Severus says sharply. \u201cI know damn well how close to exhaustion you were when you came into the Great Hall after rescuing Lucius. And you haven\u2019t cast your spells as strongly since. And you rub your head and legs sometimes when you think someone isn\u2019t looking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaces. It\u2019s true that he didn\u2019t have a concussion, but Healer Hawken came back a week ago because Harry had what amounted to a <em>magical </em>concussion, a disturbance in his power that\u2019s localized in his brain. It shows up as headaches whenever he concentrates too intently on casting. And the same thing has spread to his knees, for some reason, but those were already creaky.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe nearly took you from us,\u201d Severus whispers. \u201cPlease, sir, aren\u2019t you the one who always says that no one can stand alone and we have to be ready to help each other in teams if we fight a real battle? Let us <em>help.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry considers it for long moments, weighing various memories and bits of knowledge against each other. How he felt when he saw Lucius arching against the Cruciatus against the desperation in Severus\u2019s eyes now. How much he can accomplish with his students\u2019 magic against how drained he felt the morning after.</p>\n<p>How much he needs to find the stupid Horcruxes against his utter inability to make any headway in the last two weeks, and the undeniable fact that the diadem of Ravenclaw isn\u2019t in the hiding place Harry was sure it was in. He put off dealing with it because he was so <em>sure </em>he could deal with it any time he wanted.</p>\n<p>Maybe someone like Lily or Evan or Severus will have fresh ideas.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry says at last, and raises his hand when he sees Severus\u2019s fierce grin. \u201cBut I want you to consider the fact that anyone who gets <em>recruited </em>to this thing should be willing. I can\u2019t overstate the danger that Voldemort poses to anyone who joins in this particular effort, as opposed to in general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t set out to persuade people, my lord. I\u2019m not <em>Black</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cEither one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd no calling me \u2018my lord,\u2019 either.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Severus only smirks as if he\u2019s won a concession.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to meet you, Professor Salvare. Fleamont Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steadying himself against the dizzying knowledge that this would have been his own grandfather\u2014or is, or will be\u2014Harry smiles politely and holds out his hand. James gave him about five minutes\u2019 warning that he was bringing his father to Harry\u2019s quarters. Harry will just have to live with the consequences.</p>\n<p>Fleamont Potter is taller than Harry thought he would be, for some reason, with untamed grey hair and bright brown eyes that his silver glasses seem to highlight. He turns his head like a curious owl to look around Harry\u2019s sitting room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember seeing the private quarters of a Hogwarts professor when I was a student here,\u201d Fleamont observes in a reminiscent voice. \u201cMust say that you don\u2019t seem to favor any particular House in your decoration.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs a little. He kept the neutral colors of brown and white that were there when he moved in, and while the sitting room isn\u2019t as clean as it would be if he knew he was having guests over, he doesn\u2019t need to blush for it, either. The several chairs aren\u2019t dusty, and the mantel is clean, and the fire is bright and warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think favoring any House in a good idea,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to make common cause with students from all Houses, although it\u2019s true that most of the ones I\u2019ve sworn oaths to are Slytherins and Gryffindors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an odd combination, eh?\u201d Fleamont chuckles as he takes the chair in front of the fire. Harry looks around for James, but he\u2019s already left. Harry frowns a little. So it seems they\u2019re to be in private for this meeting. \u201cNever heard that anyone could get them to cooperate as well as you did, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles, shrugs again, and takes the chair that stands across from Fleamont. His head gives a throb, and he conceals a sigh. Healer Hawken warned him that staring too long at one particular thing, like the essays he was marking, would stir up his magical concussion. But <em>some </em>staring is necessary if Harry wants to get the bloody essays done. \u201cI think other professors got caught up in the House rivalry themselves, based on the Houses they were in when they were students, or the Houses they were rivals with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso heard that you destroyed the curse on the Defense position last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks a little, disconcerted by the jump in topic, but it\u2019s an innocuous one enough. \u201cYes. It was on the banister in the main staircase. Clever. Few people would have looked for it there, and it was free to influence the Defense professors in any number of ways as they walked past it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Fleamont strokes the small grey beard that hangs only halfway down his neck. \u201cWhy do you think no one else ever spotted it before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cFrom what I can tell, sir\u2014sorry, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont pulls his hand back from a huge gesture through the air as though to brush away an annoying fly. \u201cAs if I would accept such a title from my son\u2019s lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry feels his eyebrow twitch, but he nods. \u201cFrom what I can tell, Mr. Potter, half my predecessors didn\u2019t even think there <em>was </em>a curse. Or they didn\u2019t plan to stay more than a year in any case, or they had other goals than finding and locating the curse. Sometimes just trying to survive was enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont gives a hard, dry chuckle. \u201cYes, I remember some of the Defense professors before this, and especially the ones James had his first four years. You\u2019re right about that. Now. Why did you accept the oaths of your first followers?\u201d</p>\n<p>The questions seem random. Maybe Fleamont is just trying to get a better picture of the man that James has sworn himself to, though. Merlin knows Harry would want to do the same, if he had children.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were under enormous pressure. Some of them might have become Death Eaters. Others might have turned down one dark path or another, and some of them would have become petty and cruel, if not worse. I wanted to do what I could to spare them that fate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCaring, aren\u2019t you, Professor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t always so,\u201d Harry admits quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019m a better person than I was twenty years ago, I like to think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont\u2019s eyebrows go up for some reason. He considers Harry in silence for perhaps a minute, then says, \u201cNoticed an immediate change in James when he came home last summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot an unwelcome one, I hope.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont laughs dryly again. \u201cNo. I have to admit, Euphemia and I have spoiled him. We\u2019d given up hope that we\u2019d ever have children by the time James came along. So we gave him free rein to do pretty much as he liked, and paid for everything he wanted.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAnd then we gave his friends some of the same attention. James eventually told me that you discouraged him and his friends away from some bloody nasty pranks they might have played last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks, surprised that James told his parents that at all. \u201cYes, Mr. Potter, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not only future Death Eaters that you accepted the oaths from. Since I hope you\u2019d <em>never </em>think that we would raise James in that direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s true,\u201d Harry agrees. \u201cAlthough my first priority was Slytherin students who I didn\u2019t think were being particularly well-served by their current Head of House or the current Headmaster. But after that, I was happy to fight for and beside anyone who would swear to me and accept the other comrades I\u2019ve managed to\u2026amass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont chuckles for almost thirty seconds, although Harry doesn\u2019t see what he\u2019s said that\u2019s funny. Then he jumps into another subject change. \u201cBut my James also told us that you don\u2019t want to call yourself a lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the point of it,\u201d Harry says, maybe more honestly than he should. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go through the specific requirements of becoming a magical Lord in Britain, and I don\u2019t want to claim the kind of power that would go along with it. I need to stay humble and close to the people who depend on me. I\u2019m content being Hogwarts\u2019s Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont leans back in his chair and moves on to irrelevant revelations about himself. \u201cDid you know that I sit on the Hogwarts Board of Governors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t with them when I made my presentation to them about Evan Rosier\u2019s situation a few months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but it was, ah, mutually decided that Edward Selwyn had served as much time on the Board as he really should, and I was selected to replace him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right?\u201d Harry offers, not sure what else he can say.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think big changes are coming, Mr. Salvare,\u201d says Fleamont while he stares intently at him. \u201cWe must all fit in the places that suit us best, and if someone else is needed to help us recognize that\u2026well, I hope that you wouldn\u2019t reject any advice merely because it comes from an unexpected place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry has to snort. \u201cI get unexpected advice from my students all the time, Mr. Potter. Let alone my oathsworn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSimply remain open to it.\u201d Then Fleamont abruptly rises and holds out his hand. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to know that James\u2019s future is in such good hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to do a lot to define his own future,\u201d Harry says, even as he shakes hands with Fleamont. \u201cI can\u2019t guide him in every step he\u2019ll take.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont smiles, and walks out the door, making Harry feel baffled, but also glad that this was one meeting that didn\u2019t end with someone <em>else </em>swearing to him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any <em>sense</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it does! You just have to assume a null value!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leans on the bookshelf in the library and smiles at the table where Lily and Severus are sitting as they argue, waving their arms in the air. Someone wouldn\u2019t have to be right next to them to know how much they were enjoying it, not if you know them well. Lily\u2019s eyes are sparkling, and Severus leans forwards slightly as he pounds a fist on the table.</p>\n<p>And they get to do that because he came back in time. This would never have happened in their original sixth year.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any <em>sense </em>to assume a null value! The graph doesn\u2019t work!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou assume a null value for one of the <em>points</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus opens his mouth to respond, but Harry clears his throat, and they jump and spin around to face him. \u201cSorry to interrupt you, Miss Evans, Mr. Prince,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think Madam Pince will get a bit irritated if you don\u2019t lower your voices.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily blushes and ducks her head in a way that reminds Harry strongly enough of Hermione to sting a little. But he reminds <em>himself, </em>again, of why he came here. When Hermione is born, then she ought to have a better life than she did before, even.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d Severus says, in something closer to a normal voice.</p>\n<p>Harry waves his hand and settles down in a chair he pulls out from the table. \u201cIt\u2019s no great matter. I simply didn\u2019t want to see you go to the trouble of picking up your books and moving them. And the parchments?\u201d He peers at the parchment in front of Lily, but it\u2019s at the wrong angle and he can\u2019t make out anything on it. \u201cYou said you had a solution to the problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you make a <em>wrong assumption.</em>\u201d Severus glares at Lily.</p>\n<p>\u201cCertain people who <em>weren\u2019t even considered for Ravenclaw </em>should shut their mouths,\u201d Lily retorts, and turns around the parchment so that Harry can see it. \u201cYou were right that your original graph didn\u2019t make much sense, sir. So I started calculating other values for the two points you were trying to plot. And I realized that if you assumed a null value for one of them, then the rest of the graph fell into place, and it was easy to plot the other point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares at the graph for almost a full minute before what she\u2019s saying hits him. \u201cSo you think you can find one of these objects, but\u2014only if you assume the other doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily nods and tucks a piece of hair behind her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it work in reverse?\u201d Harry asks intently, his mind jolting into action. \u201cThat is, can you find the other one if you assume a null value for <em>this </em>one?\u201d He taps his finger against the small dot Lily has plotted on the graph.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lily says, with a proud smile. \u201cOr, at least, it doesn\u2019t give you any usable values. The swirls that you showed us just go off in random directions then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods intently, staring at the graph. It never occurred to him that he couldn\u2019t find the diadem because someone had already discovered and destroyed it.</p>\n<p>Now he just has to find out who.</p>\n<p>\u201cSterling work, Miss Evans,\u201d he says, when he realizes that he\u2019s been staring at the graph like a fool and his students have been waiting patiently on him. He smiles at her, and she smiles back. \u201cI think you have a future as an Arithmancer if you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily blushes with pride, and then shakes her head a little. \u201cI\u2019ve already decided to make my career in Charms, sir. But thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus leans forwards a little. \u201cHe\u2019s only saying <em>if you want it, </em>Evans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get snappish with me, Prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles at them both and resists the urge to ruffle their hair or something equally ridiculous. They\u2019re both so <em>cute. </em></p>\n<p>And they\u2019ve helped. Now he can search for the traces that a destroyed Horcrux would leave, instead of the object itself.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI would be very careful what kinds of choices you make around Professor Salvare, Mr. Lupin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pauses. He was going to talk to Albus, but he seems to have stumbled into something he wasn\u2019t meant to overhear. Of course, he raises a Disillusionment Charm at once, and a charm that will hopefully mask his scent, before he peers around the corner.</p>\n<p>Albus is standing in front of a pale, sweating Remus Lupin. Harry makes the automatic calculation, and then shakes his head a little. It\u2019s been long enough since the full moon that the strain should have faded away. Once again, Harry wonders how soon he can \u201cencourage\u201d the discovery of the Wolfsbane Potion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, sir,\u201d Remus whispers, sounding defeated. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard when all my best friends are sworn to him and I\u2019m not. When it was just Slytherins, it was easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot make this decision on the basis of what your friends do, as easy as it might be.\u201d Albus pats Remus\u2019s shoulder with a heavy hand. \u201cYou have to look at what you know of Professor Salvare\u2019s goals, and then the Order of the Phoenix\u2019s goals. Is he actually <em>fighting </em>Voldemort? Or is he fighting to take his place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his eyes. He doesn\u2019t think Albus actually believes that. But it makes a convenient idea to manipulate Remus with.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he does. Harry has his suspicions about the reasons Albus is so concerned about Harry\u2019s oathsworn, but he\u2019ll have to talk to Albus directly to confirm them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, sir,\u201d Remus says in a small, wretched voice. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t really want to fight in this war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that that choice is not left open for people of good heart, Mr. Lupin. It is fight in this war or fall before Voldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry has to cover his mouth with his hand so he doesn\u2019t snort aloud. That kind of choice is <em>always </em>open to most people in the magical world. The number of Voldemort collaborators and people who did their best to keep their heads down in the future argues for it.</p>\n<p>Albus glances around as if he hears something, though, and Remus backs away with an uncomfortable swallow. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, sir. Really. But right now I need to get to dinner. Sirius is already concerned about me,\u201d he adds, in an obvious, pathetic defense. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give him more reason to pressure me about swearing to Professor Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus nods. \u201cOf course, my boy, of course. Take at least another week to make the decision. I don\u2019t want you to feel urged against your will.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Another week. For something as profound as this. </em>Harry fumes a little as he watches Remus practically run away. <em>When most of the people who swore to me probably did it too quickly.</em></p>\n<p>Albus turns back towards his office, and Harry backs up a corridor, then drops the charms and walks towards his destination again with deliberately loud footfalls. When he reaches the gargoyle, Albus is standing there with a weary, patient expression.</p>\n<p>Or rather, his best try at a weary, patient expression. This close, Harry can see the tight lines around Albus\u2019s eyes, and the way his body cants away from Harry as though he thinks he\u2019ll have to go for his wand at any second.</p>\n<p>And something else, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I talk with you, Headmaster?\u201d Harry asks, with as much of an open, earnest expression as he can muster himself. \u201cThere\u2019s an important question I need to ask you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus\u2019s eyes narrow a little, but he nods. They go up the moving staircase together, and Albus fusses with his robes as he sits down behind the desk. Harry takes his own seat and starts to open his mouth, but a streak of fiery light interrupts him.</p>\n<p>Harry draws his wand and makes to leap up from the chair, stunned despite himself that Albus is going to attack him right in the school. But then he realizes that the streak of fiery light is a crooning, singing phoenix, who\u2019s sitting on Harry\u2019s lap and stretching up his beak to bill gently at Harry\u2019s chin and nose.</p>\n<p>Harry puts his wand down and blinks at Fawkes. The phoenix welcomed him the day he came to apply for the Defense post, but Harry hasn\u2019t really interacted with him since then.</p>\n<p>Fawkes gives a harder and more insistent croon, and Harry finds himself scratching his crest. Fawkes promptly chirps and turns around so that he\u2019s sitting with his face pointed towards the Headmaster\u2019s desk, and tilts his neck to be available for more scratching.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks up at Albus. His expression is notably softer. He clears his throat and says, \u201cI may have misjudged you, Henry, my boy. No Dark wizard would find the touch of a phoenix so comforting. My apologies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods slowly. \u201cI came to make a similar sort of apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Albus sounds more curious than anything else now. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you distrusted me for no reason and seemed to concentrate more of your energy on opposing me than Voldemort. But\u2014now I think I know why. I\u2019m sorry for doubting you.\u201d Harry sighs. \u201cAnd you can remove the glamour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus goes very still. Then he says, \u201cI <em>will </em>request an explanation of how you knew that,\u201d and raises his wand to trace in a circle around the top of his head.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t need the chiming from the walls to know what he\u2019ll see. The glamours fade, and now Harry can see the circle of charred skin at Albus\u2019s temples, the darkening of his hair, the marks like burns on his scalp. Albus put on Rowena Ravenclaw\u2019s diadem, and he\u2019s paying with his life for it.</p>\n<p><em>Some things don\u2019t change, </em>Harry thinks, as anticipatory grief settles into his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you find it?\u201d Harry asks quietly.</p>\n<p>Albus stares at him in a way that says he\u2019s going along with this for now, but he does expect his own answers soon. \u201cI have known there was a disturbance, a magical weight, if you will, on the school for a few months now. I could only sense it once you dissipated the curse on the Defense post. The resonance of that magic concealed it before. I tracked it down and couldn\u2019t believe it when I found it. I removed two curses from it, and\u2014I thought it was safe.\u201d Albus closes his eyes. \u201cI had come to realize that my wisdom was not as great as I thought it was, and that meant that I needed more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows against his emotions. \u201cBut you destroyed it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus gives a small smile. \u201cYes. I felt the curse begin to affect me, and I removed the diadem. Then I blasted it with Fiendfyre, the one curse I had always read could destroy anything. What <em>was </em>it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA Horcrux. One of Voldemort\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus\u2019s face pales so dramatically that Harry thinks he might fall over if he wasn\u2019t already sitting down. \u201cHe made <em>more than one</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive, as near as I can tell,\u201d Harry says. \u201cThe diadem you found, Slytherin\u2019s locket, a cup that belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, and a ring that belonged to his Slytherin ancestors. And a fifth object that I\u2019m having a hard time locating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus is blinking, slowly, as if it\u2019s going to take him that long to absorb Voldemort\u2019s monumental stupidity. Harry knows the feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy five?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe intends to create a total of six,\u201d Harry says. \u201cTo create\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven pieces of soul, yes.\u201d Albus slaps his desk with one hand. \u201cI always did think Tom was too interested in that particular magical number.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry privately suspects that Albus thought Tom Riddle was too interested in everything Dark, but he lets that pass. \u201cIt\u2019s taken him since his Hogwarts years to create this many. I think it\u2019s partially the fact that the process itself is taxing and that he wants to use objects that mean something to him. He might not have that sixth object yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he know that the diadem has been destroyed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt it. He didn\u2019t know that the ring had been destroyed until he went searching for it and didn\u2019t find it. And he only knows about the locket and the cup because my Fiendfyre destroyed them right in front of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know about them?\u201d Albus asks quietly. \u201cWhy are you hunting them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. He wants to tell Albus, yes, but he honestly doesn\u2019t trust him with the full truth, even granted that the diadem might have influenced his behavior. But he can tell him part of the truth which will contain the <em>essential </em>shards of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want Voldemort dead to protect my students. I knew that the students in Slytherin House, but others, too, would be pressured to join him. Maybe even drawn towards him, if they thought he would promise them power and protection. So I wanted to make sure that he wasn\u2019t a threat. Some of that I did by teaching them to think for themselves\u2014well, I thought.\u201d Harry sighs. The results of that experiment still disappoint him. \u201cAnd some of that by offering a viable alternative. But the rest of it has to go towards removing Tom Riddle from the board.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat answers the second question, but not the first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to be an Unspeakable, Albus,\u201d Harry says, meeting his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t speak about the secrets I learn in the Department of Mysteries to anyone outside it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is also <em>true. </em>Just not the whole.</p>\n<p>Albus catches his breath sharply. \u201cI wondered, when I heard about some of the spells and devices you had used against Tom. But I didn\u2019t think I would get confirmation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would get such opposition,\u201d Harry says calmly. \u201cOr I might have told you the truth before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus flushes and averts his eyes. \u201cI thought\u2014the diadem showed me that you had more knowledge and intelligence than you should have had. That you had some great determination. But it neglected to show me anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe diadem promised <em>wit</em>, not wisdom, according to the legends of the inscription on it.\u201d Harry keeps his voice calm, still. Yes, a lot is explained, now.</p>\n<p>Including the reason why Albus is still alive, despite the advancing curse. It can\u2019t be the same curse that was on the ring. That one, Voldemort seems to have viciously protected in both timelines, maybe because it was a family heirloom instead of one that belonged to someone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can try to save your life,\u201d Harry offers quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this curse is, but I can try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would\u2014appreciate that, Henry, my boy.\u201d Albus\u2019s gaze drifts from Fawkes, who is still snuggled in Harry\u2019s lap, to Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI have made hasty judgments about you, and ones I had no right to make. Please accept my apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods and keeps to himself that Albus probably only changed his mind because of the phoenix\u2019s welcome of him. It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Harry isn\u2019t going to have two opponents as he hunts down the diary, wherever Voldemort\u2019s put it, and he can maybe save Albus the way he didn\u2019t manage to in his original timeline.</p>\n<p>Time sings from the walls.</p>\n<p>Harry keeps the grim smile he wants to give inside. Yes, certain things are going to go the way they did in the original timeline. Harry is still going to hunt the Horcruxes with Albus\u2019s knowledge, and Albus is probably going to die of the curse from a Horcrux, although Harry might be able to slow it down enough to give him years of life instead of just a year. He\u2019ll accept that those things will be the same.</p>\n<p>Time snickers in the next chime.</p>\n<p>Harry ignores it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI have, ah, been wanting to meet you in person for some time, Professor Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny, Mr. Malfoy.\u201d Harry smiles at Abraxas over the glass of wine, which, to give Slughorn what little credit he deserves, is <em>very </em>good. Still, Harry would have avoided Slughorn\u2019s vernal equinox party if he knew that the recently-released Abraxas Malfoy was going to be there. \u201cI thought we already had.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas clears his throat and looks around nervously, as though anticipating rescue from some quarter. He\u2019s not going to get it. Everyone else in the bright, expanded, green-and-white-decorated room in the dungeons that Slughorn uses for his parties is carefully looking away from them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard that Narcissa told you about our coming surprise,\u201d Abraxas babbles, but in a soft voice. \u201cAnd that she intended to name the baby after you in some capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe did, yes.\u201d Harry takes another sip of wine and decides that torturing Death Eaters this way is much more fun than doing it for real. \u201cCongratulations on becoming a grandfather. I hope that your <em>concentration </em>will be on that task in the future. It\u2019s so hard to raise children properly, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas\u2019s face is the color of old cheese. He coughs a little, and murmurs, \u201cI do sit on the Board of Governors, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry assumes it\u2019s a plea for respect. He shrugs a little. \u201cI met the Board of Governors once already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, during my unfortunate absence\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, <em>incarceration </em>has fewer syllables.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abraxas takes a step back from him. Harry gives him a merciless smile and contemplates what he should say next.</p>\n<p>Abraxas clears his throat and repeats, \u201cI\u2019m on the Board of Governors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a threat, Mr. Malfoy?\u201d Harry keeps his voice as cool and uncaring as before. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll take it as one. Luckily for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Abraxas hurries away. Harry shakes his head, and makes an excuse to leave the party as soon as possible. He\u2019s had his share of baffling conversations with adults for this week.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry stares down at the point that he\u2019s plotted on the graph. He\u2019s sure of it now. The diary is on another small island off the coast, actually not that far from the cave that originally contained the locket.</p>\n<p>He could go after it tonight. And by the morning, Voldemort would be mortal again.</p>\n<p>Harry closes his hand into a fist and then closes his eyes in turn, hissing out sharply. The throb in his head is a reminder that the magical concussion, while better, isn\u2019t completely healed. He cast a Stunner today, or he meant to, and actually set a second-year\u2019s desk on fire as his concentration wavered and his magic snapped out of control.</p>\n<p>He could go after it tonight. And he would be a fool if he did so.</p>\n<p>Harry opens his eyes and scowls at the graph. He has no idea what protections Voldemort might have set up around his last Horcrux, especially if it\u2019s a brand-new location chosen after Voldemort became aware that he only had one\u2014or two, as he probably thinks\u2014left. Harry doesn\u2019t know if he would be able to handle them. He had to be prepared to handle the sea serpent, but he doesn\u2019t know if he can risk a scouting mission on the diary. Voldemort might move it again if he does.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have to have help. </em>\n</p>\n<p>But who? Harry\u2019s mind turns through the possibilities. He doesn\u2019t like any of them. Lucius and Narcissa are soon to have a child, and Andromeda has one. The last thing that Harry wants is to create more orphans. The rest of his followers are literal schoolchildren.</p>\n<p>Someone knocks on the door of his quarters. Harry puts down the graph and stands up, concerned. For someone to come to his rooms this late, it\u2019s probably an emergency. \u201cCome in!\u201d he calls, after he\u2019s disabled a few wards.</p>\n<p>The door opens, and reveals both Regulus and Severus. Harry\u2019s concern deepens. Their presence together indicates a disturbance in the Slytherin common room, probably. And while technically he should send them away and make them fetch Slughorn, he knows that he\u2019s better at handling something like this than the Slytherins\u2019 Head of House.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs someone wounded?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo you need me to summon Madam Pomfrey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Regulus stares at him. \u201cBut someone could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pauses. Now he\u2019s having baffling conversations with teenagers. Well, unlike with Fleamont or Abraxas, there\u2019s no reason that he can\u2019t cut through the bollocks to the truth. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he demands, glancing back and forth between the boys.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe both woke with the conviction that you were in danger,\u201d Severus says. He spins his wand between his fingers and looks around Harry\u2019s sitting room, as if assuming that danger is lurking behind the couch. He only looks marginally reassured when Harry raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cAnd then it ebbed. Regulus and I had met up in the common room and were talking when we felt it again. We came here as soon as we could.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaces. That\u2019s a side-effect of the oaths that he didn\u2019t count on. Technically, he knew things like borrowing magic from his people was possible, but not their starting to sense his moods and the like.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was considering doing something reckless,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to worry about it. I\u2019m going to think on it. I just need to make sure that I choose someone strong and experienced to go with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus clears his throat pointedly and taps his wand against his own chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re powerful, Mr. Prince,\u201d Harry says. \u201cAnd of age. But not experienced enough to handle something like this. I won\u2019t risk you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should we allow you to risk yourself?\u201d Regulus asks, and then smiles, an unholy smile that makes Harry stare at him. \u201cI know what I\u2019ll do if you decide that you\u2019re not going to take anyone with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to do that. I said I would get\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I felt it through the oaths now,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cThe fluctuation. Thinking about taking help, and then making up your mind that it would be too dangerous for anyone to go with you when you said you wouldn\u2019t risk Severus.\u201d His smile widens. \u201cI\u2019ll send an owl to Healer Hawken and tell him that your magical injuries are getting worse, but that you didn\u2019t want to bother him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry knows, from an extremely non-baffling conversation he had with Hawken a week ago, that the Healer won\u2019t hesitate to tie him to the bed if that\u2019s necessary. He sighs. \u201cI won\u2019t go alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what are you going to do about this artifact?\u201d Severus demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Harry admits, although he doesn\u2019t know if he should. <em>Is </em>he involving schoolchildren too much in his problems? He knows that he needs help, but does it have to be from people he chose to shelter and protect?</p>\n<p>And having them research the location of the Horcruxes is a completely different thing than having them come with him to destroy one.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that the Dark Lord is going to move or use this artifact right away?\u201d Regulus asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. But the longer we wait, the greater the chance that he will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sill gives us at least a day to think about it,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cAnd I think I know someone who <em>will </em>help.\u201d He turns away and trots up the corridor before Harry can question him. It\u2019s too much, Harry knows, to think that he\u2019s going back to the Slytherin common room.</p>\n<p>Harry fondly remembers the days when Regulus did as he was told, and turns to Severus. \u201cI promise you that I won\u2019t go after this artifact without help and company,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease go back to sleep, Mr. Prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should do the same thing, my lord. You look like shit, if you\u2019ll excuse me saying so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can excuse you for the language more than for the title,\u201d Harry mutters. The headache is swelling until it fills his world.</p>\n<p>Severus laughs briefly. \u201cDo you need me to get a headache draught from my private stores, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Of course a seventeen-year-old Potions prodigy has his own private store of useful potions, </em>Harry thinks, and shakes his head. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to sleep the minute my head hits the pillow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Severus\u2019s face smooths out. \u201cThen I\u2019ll leave you to get some much-deserved rest, sir.\u201d He waves, and turns and walks down the corridor. Harry watches him, and he <em>does </em>turn in the direction of the Slytherin common room.</p>\n<p>Harry shuts the door, glances one more time at the dot on the graph, and then goes to keep his promise to his\u2014</p>\n<p>Minions? Can he think of them that way?</p>\n<p>Time sings at him like windchimes, and Harry rolls his eyes and dismisses the thought from his mind. If he <em>does </em>start thinking of them like that, then probably he\u2019ll end up taking Voldemort\u2019s place in a way that he doesn\u2019t want at all.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Irritants, though. That has a nice ring to it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry opens his bedroom door and stops at the sight of the person in the sitting room. The person stares back. Neither of them says a word. Harry has never seen this man face-to-face before, but he knows who he has to be.</p>\n<p>Then Harry turns to the second person in his sitting room and asks, \u201cWhat is your father doing here, Regulus?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus beams at him. \u201cI know that you need someone who can help you go after the Dark Lord\u2019s artifact. My father is powerful, and our family owes you debts because you rescued me and helped protect me and Sirius. So he\u2019s going to help you go and retrieve that artifact, or destroy it. Whichever you need to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne could argue that I also took your father\u2019s sons away from him,\u201d Harry says in a low voice, his eyes on Orion Black. He looks as if he needs a stiff drink and to leave, in roughly that order. \u201cYour mother would certainly say that. What did you <em>really </em>do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him that Sirius and I would both change our last names to Salvare if he didn\u2019t help you. Andromeda and Narcissa changed their names when they got married, and Bellatrix will do the same thing if she ever gets married. Or she\u2019ll die in prison in the war, probably. That means no one from the most recent generation with the name \u2018Black\u2019 will be left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turns to stare at him. \u201cYou said that? You\u2019re serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Regulus says, in such a puzzled, hurt tone that Harry is taken in for a minute. \u201cI\u2019m not my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes and rubs his hand over his forehead. Regulus is being too fifteen for him right now.</p>\n<p>Orion Black softly clears his throat. Harry opens his eyes and looks at the man, who\u2019s mostly silvery-haired rather than dark-haired and looks more like Sirius in the face. \u201cI did in fact agree with him that we owe you debts. The Dark Lord would have killed Regulus, and Albus Dumbledore would have enslaved Sirius.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry refrains from saying that he doesn\u2019t think Dumbledore is going to brand Order of the Phoenix members any more than Harry is going to brand his oathsworn. Right now, the deception serves him. \u201cAnd because of that, you\u2019re willing to risk your life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Orion shakes his head, his grey eyes dull and apprehensive. \u201cBecause the Dark Lord tried to kill my younger son. And because both of them have thrived being sworn to you. It showed in the letters they wrote to me, and it showed when Regulus Flooed me last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. \u201cYou should know that if I accept your help, there\u2019s a good chance that you could die from this. Voldemort values that artifact about almost anything else at this point, and he\u2019ll have powerful protections around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Orion gives him a shaky smile, although he flinches when Harry speaks Voldemort\u2019s name. \u201cI am aware of some of those protections. He said that anyone who goes to the island will have to pass wards that require a Death Eater\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks at him. Keeping his movements large, smooth, and broad so that Harry won\u2019t react as if he\u2019s reaching for his wand, Orion tugs his left sleeve up, and reveals the Dark Mark.</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t remember if Sirius and Regulus\u2019s father was Marked in the first timeline, but he supposes it doesn\u2019t matter. What does is that he can bypass those protections with Orion\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cI accept your help. I\u2019m also going to ask a few other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more help we can have, the better. From what the Dark Lord said, the traps are\u2026extensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry draws his wand, and Orion tenses, although he doesn\u2019t run. Regulus just looks bright-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to ward the Dark Mark so that Voldemort can\u2019t reach you through it,\u201d Harry explains. \u201cHe could try to kill or cripple you with the pain otherwise, and as terrible a parent as you\u2019ve been, I don\u2019t want Sirius and Regulus to lose their father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Orion flinches a little more, but extends his left arm. Regulus doesn\u2019t leave, and Harry doesn\u2019t ask him to. He settles on the couch next to Orion, and begins to hiss out the litany of commands to the snake in the Mark that he used when he cut the connection Lucius\u2019s Mark had to Voldemort.</p>\n<p>By the end of the process, his headache fills his world, and he sits back on the couch and pants for a moment. Orion studies him as he folds his left sleeve over the Mark, but he says nothing about it. \u201cHow many other people will go with us?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask for at least two.\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t intend to say that he\u2019ll ask Dumbledore for a few experienced Order members. No need for Orion to worry about where their \u201chelp\u201d will come from. \u201cAnd then I have some colleagues to visit.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll trust the Order members to go with you, and trust them if they offer you some unsolicited advice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorts and removes a clingy Fawkes from his shoulder to put him back on his perch. Fawkes croons dejectedly, but stays in place. Harry goes and flops down in the chair in front of Albus\u2019s desk. \u201cYes, although you have to be aware that one of the people accompanying us will be a Death Eater. That means that they\u2019ll need to keep <em>advice </em>about him to themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA Death Eater you can trust?\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus is clearly skeptical, but Harry only raises his eyebrows. \u201cYes. As a Parselmouth myself, I can take control of the serpent that appears in the Mark when necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus blinks. \u201cYou might advertise that. There would be more than one Death Eater who might join you for the promise of such freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cVoldemort will die pretty soon, and then I\u2019ll free the people who ask for it. But there\u2019s no point in announcing it right now and having him turn on his people or try to make sure that he\u2019s controlling them with the Imperius or the like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d Albus considers it. Then he says, \u201cI can give you the services of two brothers, Gideon and Fabian Prewett. They\u2019re used to functioning as a team, and they have some Auror training. They\u2019ll do what you ask of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallows. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Silently, he vows <em>not </em>to get Ron\u2019s uncles killed by Death Eaters, no matter how much Time would like the symmetry.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you should be going soon?\u201d Albus is staring at him in open concern. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well at all, Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ignores Fawkes\u2019s croon and the softer buzz under it that he suspects is coming from the Elder Wand and its whiny neediness. \u201cWe won\u2019t go today, sir. And I\u2019m going to pick up some tricks before then to even the odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry reads through the parchment that the Unspeakable to greet him this time produced, frowning deeply. \u201cI appreciate the effort that went into this spell,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like it would be much good in battle. It requires long preparation, and too much of the main ingredient from someone to leave them battle-ready afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor some<em>one </em>it would be too much, but not from some <em>many</em>,\u201d says the Unspeakable who greeted him this time, as anonymous as ever in a grey cloak and masked glamour. They\u2019re in the middle of the Silver Room, which is used in developing new spells. Harry doesn\u2019t understand why the silver surroundings are conducive to that particular field, but then, he spent most of his years with the Unspeakables in the Time Chamber.</p>\n<p>Harry flicks his eyebrows up. \u201cI see.\u201d And that does make sense of a notation at the end of the spell that recommended the precise number of people the caster should have around them. Harry rolls the parchment up and stores it in a scroll case on his belt. \u201cHow much do I owe you for the development of the spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUse it in battle, Mr. Salvare. That will pay us for the use.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. He suspected that would be the answer. The Unspeakables rarely get to see their more theoretical spells tested in the field, not like Aurors, and this one is more theoretical than others. Among other things, it requires a Parselmouth. \u201cThank you. And the one that I <em>did </em>pay you to develop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Unspeakable makes a complicated gesture with their hands, and a silvery baffle of light that blocks the sight of new magical developments from anyone who doesn\u2019t work in the Silver Room draws back. Harry looks down at the device with deep curiosity. It reminds him of the Mirror of Erised, in miniature. It\u2019s a small reflective glass surrounded by a golden frame with two small legs. The glass swings back and forth in the frame, just as Harry specified.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have an advanced theoretical mind, Mr. Salvare,\u201d the Unspeakable says as they hand the small mirror to him. \u201cWe could use you again in the Department of Mysteries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stares. He expected an invitation, but not one so blatant. Most of the time, Unspeakables allow time travelers, who are after all mostly their own people, to go their own way and do what they want.</p>\n<p>But as much as someone can whose face is masked from sight, the Unspeakable radiates welcome.</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it.\u201d Truly, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do after Voldemort is defeated. He\u2019ll probably remain in the position of Defense professor for a few more years to protect his students and ensure that some of them are settled on paths that benefit them, but after that, will anyone need him as much? He can\u2019t think they will.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd one more thing you should see, Mr. Salvare.\u201d The Unspeakable turns and leaves the Silver Room, Harry trailing behind.</p>\n<p>He suspects where they\u2019re going, and sighs a little as his fears are confirmed and they walk into the Hall of Prophecy. The Unspeakable takes him straight to what Harry thinks, at first, is a different prophecy. But then he realizes it\u2019s merely the original orb that\u2019s grown bigger, and he can make out some of the writing on it now, words floating near the surface.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2026thrice defied him\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Harry <em>has, </em>at least if defiance counts as times Voldemort and other people both knew about it. The duel, saving Regulus from being kidnapped, and being kidnapped himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for giving us a chance to research this.\u201d The Unspeakable clasps their hands together. \u201cIn matters of prophecy that relate to time travelers, flesh triumphs over circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, of course.\u201d The Unspeakable leans forwards a little. \u201cYou worked in the Hall of Prophecy, but in different\u2014ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. He doesn\u2019t know if perhaps the Unspeakables in this time have taken measures to ensure that their prophecy records are safer than they were in the future, but then, he doesn\u2019t expect it to concern him much.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe debate,\u201d the Unspeakable continues in a tone of relish, \u201cwas between those who thought that Time would continue to prefer the time traveler to fulfill a prophecy\u2014favor the same <em>flesh</em>\u2014or whether it would prefer someone who could fulfill the original prophecy whether or not they were the time traveler\u2014favor the same <em>circumstances. </em>There might have been another child born in the time you left who could have done what you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods, not remotely surprised. If he\u2019s special, it\u2019s because of the way Voldemort chose him and the wizarding world revered him, and he adapted to fit those circumstances. Someone else could become the \u201csavior,\u201d too, if they had to. \u201cAnd you discovered that flesh triumphs over circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Time prefers that you fulfill a new prophecy rather than someone else fulfilling the old one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks at the prophecy and shakes his head. \u201cI won\u2019t play it for you.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want the prophecy to influence his circumstances and make them self-fulfilling as they were for Voldemort with Trelawney\u2019s first prophecy.</p>\n<p>The Unspeakable sighs, but they don\u2019t seem surprised. \u201cVery well. But I hope you will let us know how both the spell and your mirror do in battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles and crafts a protective bubble to go around the mirror, just to make absolutely sure that it won\u2019t be damaged in the Apparition. \u201cI\u2019ll provide you the memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to work with a Death Eater?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gideon\u2019s voice is low, controlled, but angry. Harry took Orion Black to the meeting with the Prewett twins in Albus\u2019s office, because he saw no point in delaying the issue.</p>\n<p>Gideon and Fabian are both tall men with violently red hair and no trace of Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s humor. Fabian has a scar on his cheek, but he isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s objecting to Orion\u2019s presence, at least verbally. He hangs back near Albus\u2019s desk and twirls his wand between his fingers instead, eyeing both Harry and Orion with intense skepticism.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry says, ignoring Gideon\u2019s tone. It\u2019s easy enough after ignoring Voldemort\u2019s taunts and some of the things his students think it\u2019s appropriate to say in classes. \u201cVoldemort has a ward around the island so that no one except those with a Dark Mark can get in. But I\u2019ve changed Orion\u2019s Dark Mark so that he can\u2019t be hurt by it. It still has the connection to Voldemort\u2019s magic, though. <em>He </em>won\u2019t notice any difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fabian straightens up when he hears that, and stares at Harry with something too intense to be called respect. Then he exchanges a glance with his brother, and nods. \u201cVery well. We\u2019re coming with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry resists the temptation to snap, <em>I hope so</em>, and just nods to the Prewett brothers. He glances at Orion. Orion looks back at him and shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re purebloods,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Harry settles for a long, long sigh.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Apparating to the island is the easy part. Harry gives the coordinates to the Prewetts, and they make the jump easily. Orion follows them, and Harry\u2014</p>\n<p>Lands on a shore of rock and sand that immediately crumbles beneath his feet, responding, as Harry realizes after a moment of incredulous flailing, to the feeling of his specific, individual magic.</p>\n<p><em>Sometimes he\u2019s smart, </em>Harry thinks crossly, catching his feet at the bottom of the beach, and then casting a Lightening Charm on himself when the beach starts to crumble again. He floats up and away when he pushes off from the sand, and hovers in midair as he watches the stone and sand reassemble. <em>When it\u2019s most inconvenient. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWas the ward an alarm?\u201d Fabian asks. He has his wand out, staring around at the grey, rainy beach, where waters are swirling and churning beneath a cloudy sky. \u201cWill he know that you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says. \u201cIt was only designed to keep me from Apparating in or easily approaching the island.\u201d He conjures a rope and twists it around his ankle, then tosses the other end to Orion. \u201cHere, tow me, or I won\u2019t be able to move easily without ending the spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Orion catches the rope with only a blink of surprise, but Harry has the Prewett brothers focused on him suspiciously again. \u201cHow did you know that it <em>wasn\u2019t </em>an alarm?\u201d Gideon asks. \u201cAnd how did you manage to use the Lightening Charm so quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to be an Unspeakable,\u201d Harry says, which makes a convenient answer to everything, especially because it\u2019s true. \u201cAnd my students come up with the same kinds of silly tricks.\u201d</p>\n<p>That at least makes the Prewett brothers relax. They glance around, and Fabian asks, \u201cSo where is this artifact that we need to destroy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry takes a moment to orient on the diary. There\u2019s an unmistakable pulse of Dark magic from the center of the island, an area that seems to be uphill and then down in the middle of what might be a hollow between the small hillocks. \u201cTo the northeast.\u201d</p>\n<p>They turn and trek in that direction, Orion towing Harry along on the rope. It makes Harry feel ridiculous, rather like a giant balloon, but at least they\u2019re doing what they need to do. It\u2019s only when they reach the top of the hill that Fabian and Gideon reel back with their hands across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harry asks. He glances around, but he can\u2019t see whatever ward or trap might have affected them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a choking\u2014<em>screen </em>of some kind.\u201d Fabian sounds like he\u2019s on the verge of vomiting. \u201cLike running into a cloud of skunk scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. He must be above it. \u201cIs this the Death Eater ward, Mr. Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Orion bares his Mark and moves slowly forwards, waving his arm around. Harry can\u2019t see or sense the ending of a ward, but the Prewett brothers straighten up and remove their hands from their faces a minute later, which he supposes is the best he\u2019s going to get. \u201cThere. That should end it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very arrogant,\u201d Gideon mutters as they trek forwards again, their wands out and covering as many angles as they can.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways a fault of his,\u201d Harry mutters.</p>\n<p>But his heartbeat ratchets up when he sees a hollow in the middle of the sandy hollow between the hills, containing the diary out in the open. Voldemort isn\u2019t <em>that </em>arrogant. He would never leave the diary without protection, even if it was just from the elements in the kind of box that contained the ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay back,\u201d Harry says, and the Prewett brothers obey the snap of command in his voice, scrambling a little way up the hill they just descended. Orion freezes in place, but Harry thinks he can probably feel the waves of power coming from the diary better than any of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Gideon whispers, his wand trained on the diary now.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a Riddle family grimoire?\u201d Fabian adds.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs a little. So Albus told them Voldemort\u2019s real name, but not the history of his family. That\u2019s so typical of him that Harry can\u2019t even get angry. \u201cNo. The Riddle family was a Muggle one. This is the artifact that we came looking for. Keep in mind that it\u2019s resistant to destruction by everything but basilisk venom and Fiendfyre.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe heard you can wield Fiendfyre.\u201d Fabian glances away from the diary to give Harry one of those judgmental looks he seems to be prone to. \u201cAre you going to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, once we ascertain that there aren\u2019t any other traps. Voldemort would never have left it just lying out like this in the open if there weren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry draws his wand, and in that instant, the diary stirs and snaps open.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no chance to resist it. The long cone of sepia light that unfolds from the diary\u2019s pages seizes all of them, and then draws them violently into its pages.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry lands roughly in the middle of a Hogwarts corridor, or at least it looks like one. The stones are brown and heavily outlined in black. He scrambles up, feeling the floor give beneath his feet the way it does in dreams, and severs the rope holding onto his ankle. It\u2019s going to be a hindrance in battle.</p>\n<p>The others materialize beside him, the Prewett brothers looking washed-out with brown hair instead of ginger, and Orion looking monochromatic. \u201cWhat <em>is </em>this?\u201d Fabian asks, his voice thin and high as he and his brother spin around and around, keeping their backs pressed against each other\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re inside the diary,\u201d Harry says grimly. Voldemort must have fed the diary some of his own power, or perhaps a victim, for it to be this active. \u201cIt\u2019s a Horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>Horcrux.</em>\u201d Orion is gasping with horror, and although it\u2019s hard to tell because of the way the spirit of the diary has washed out the colors, Harry thinks he\u2019s gone pale with it, too. \u201cI never would have\u2026I <em>never </em>would have followed him if I\u2019d known. That crosses an important line.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry keeps his thoughts about how the torture and murder of innocents should have been enough of a line to himself, and just nods. The Prewett brothers have stopped turning in circles and are looking at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Horcrux?\u201d Gideon asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn object with a piece of a soul attached, which means that the person who made it can\u2019t die as long as the object exists.\u201d Harry reaches into his robe pocket, searching for the little bubble that contains the mirror the Unspeakables gave him. It\u2019s still intact, and he thinks he can use it in the diary. In a strange way, perhaps, but he can use it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to destroy it, then.\u201d Gideon raises his wand and looks around as if searching for the best place to strike.</p>\n<p>Harry opens his mouth to answer, but the corridor warps viciously around them, bending and twisting like a snake that wants to throw them off its back. Harry braces himself as the others cry out. He knows that Tom Riddle controls every sight and sensation they\u2019ll experience in the diary. And that means that he\u2019ll probably disorient them with tactics like this and then strike from behind.</p>\n<p>Harry turns around, and sees a black liquid like the one that came out when he defeated the diary in his world seeping out of the walls.</p>\n<p>Harry swishes his wand and casts Fiendfyre at it.</p>\n<p>The flames are without color in the diary, and form only sickly-looking grey gargoyles instead of their usual beasts. But the black liquid recoils from the fire with a piercing scream, and Harry gets control of it with a vicious hauling on the reins of his magic.</p>\n<p>Which makes a pounding pain leap through his temples.</p>\n<p>Harry scowls. This magical concussion <em>sucks. </em></p>\n<p>He did it, though. The black liquid withdraws into the walls, and there\u2019s a long pause that Harry can only describe as \u201cwaiting.\u201d Then the black liquid appears again, but this time, it swirls around with the grey light and forms into the shape of a young, handsome Tom Riddle, much as he appeared when he took form in the Chamber of Secrets in Harry\u2019s first world.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, gentlemen.\u201d Riddle glances from face to face, as if fixing them in his memory or getting ready to chide them. Then he turns to Harry and freezes, staring at him.</p>\n<p>Harry gives Riddle a grim smile. He has no idea what Riddle\u2019s sensing, if it\u2019s that he\u2019s the one who used the Fiendfyre or that he\u2019s a Parselmouth or even that he used to be a Horcrux. In the end, it doesn\u2019t matter much. What <em>does </em>is that he can destroy Riddle, and from the way Riddle backs up a step, he might know that.</p>\n<p>But then Riddle stops retreating, and sets his shoulders proudly. \u201cWhat is this about?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou have invaded my home, you have tried to injure me, and I should simply accept that and let you go?\u201d His voice is injured.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloody Horcrux,\u201d Gideon says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t owe you any apologies,\u201d Fabian adds.</p>\n<p>Riddle\u2019s eyes are so wide that they look like spilled puddles of ink. He glances around and ends up staring at Harry again. \u201cWhat is it about you?\u201d he demands. \u201cDid you tell them what I was? Why are you <em>different</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry studies him for a second. It\u2019s possible that he can enrage him the way he would the real Voldemort, and then he\u2019ll expose himself with dangerous lashing out. \u201c<em>I am your enemy</em>,\u201d he says in Parseltongue, and Riddle falls further back from him at the sound of the snake language. \u201c<em>I destroyed you in one world, and then I came to this one to do the same thing.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2014you are kin to me if you can speak this language,</em>\u201d Riddle says, his mind obviously racing as his voice falters. \u201c<em>Why would my own family turn on me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gives a thin laugh. \u201c<em>That appeal doesn\u2019t mean much, coming from someone who slaughtered and sacrificed the only living family he had left.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Riddle springs silently at Harry. He\u2019s unwinding and dissolving even as he comes, turning into the oily black liquid again. He whips thin tendrils around Harry\u2019s throat and flows to cover his mouth and nostrils.</p>\n<p>Harry curves his fingers inwards and punctures the bubble that holds the little mirror.</p>\n<p>The mirror immediately flares with brilliant light, the only color in the whole monotonous world of the diary. It turns and directs that beam of light up at the oily liquid Riddle has become. The black liquid screams and breaks apart, flowing frantically back into the walls and stones.</p>\n<p>Harry catches the mirror by the legs and puts it on the floor. The golden frame is already turning grey, and the diary around them is peeling back in delicate swaths of brown and black and white, revealing the scribbled letters that make up reality here, and the world of the island beyond, faint as a memory.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t have much time. Only until that golden frame turns completely grey.</p>\n<p>Harry gathers up Orion and Gideon and Fabian with his eyes. \u201cCan all of you cast Fiendfyre?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Orion nods. Gideon grimaces. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it. We try to avoid Dark Arts as much as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen guard this mirror,\u201d Harry says, nodding to the tiny thing. \u201cThis is the only thing guaranteeing us a way out of here. Mr. Black and I will use the curse.\u201d He turns so that his back is to Orion\u2019s, and the twins adopt the same posture.</p>\n<p>The black liquid is already forming in the walls again, sometimes mingling with floating letters. Some of it looks red, and Harry imagines that he\u2019s looking at the blood of whoever it was that Voldemort fed to the diary.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Harry tells Orion, and they raise their wands and call the fire at the same time.</p>\n<p>Again there\u2019s a piercing scream as the flames lift and curl, lifeless-looking though they are. Harry ignores the way a crown of pain is tightening around his head, and the way his blood is pounding harder and harder through his veins. He shapes the grey fire into snakes and drives their heads and fangs again and again into the black liquid.</p>\n<p>Another attack of some kind, which looks like a pseudo-basilisk, comes surging down the corridor towards the Prewetts, but they take care of it with stinging whip-like curses that impress Harry.</p>\n<p>And which aren\u2019t the bright color they probably should be. The little mirror trembles on the floor, on the verge of running out. Three-quarters of its frame has already turned to lead.</p>\n<p>Harry turns and aims the grey fire straight at the little mirror.</p>\n<p>He hopes he\u2019s guessed right about the theoretical spells that bind the mirror, and what they\u2019re going to do to his weak fire now. The Unspeakables built the mirror to his specifications, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean that something like it has ever existed before or that it\u2019ll work now. Harry never anticipated battling <em>inside </em>the diary.</p>\n<p>The Fiendfyre strikes the mirror\u2019s glass and glances up and away from it. For a moment, it remains a grey stream with only a few heads.</p>\n<p>And then it turns a brilliant gold, and rears up into a massive hydra with eight heads, singing with cruel joy.</p>\n<p>Riddle screams again around them. Harry turns in a circle and sweeps the walls with his Fiendfyre. They crumble and wisp away, and Harry and Orion and the Prewett twins are standing on the ground of the island again, with the diary turning into a smoking ruin behind them and the mirror toppling over onto the sand, a powerless sculpture of lead and cracked glass.</p>\n<p>And the Fiendfyre is still raging.</p>\n<p>It rears above Harry, twisting back and forth, growing more and more heads and necks, crackling down at him. The ground of the island is whispering away to ash beneath it. Harry breathes harshly, struggling to control it.</p>\n<p>The mirror was made to change whatever it shone on or which struck it into its opposite. Based on alchemy, it would only last as long as it took the frame to change from gold to lead, but that was enough to change the diary from reality to unreality.</p>\n<p>And to change the weak Fiendfyre to a raging demon that Harry\u2019s not sure he can control.</p>\n<p>Harry feels blood trickling from one nostril as he forces himself up from his knees, where he didn\u2019t even notice he\u2019d fallen. He stares at the Fiendfyre, and determination rears up in him. He knows that he can\u2019t call on his comrades\u2019 magic, not when it exhausted him so badly last time. He would pass out, and the Fiendfyre would consume everything it could, including his companions. Orion isn\u2019t strong enough to hold it, and the Prewetts have no experience with the curse.</p>\n<p>That means that Harry is going to have to conquer this fire the way he conquers the Imperius Curse: with sure, indomitable will.</p>\n<p>He stands, and he stares at the fire, and he says in Parseltongue, \u201c<em>No.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fiendfyre exults, dancing back and forth. Now it\u2019s many snakes, with many bodies, and too many rapidly-multiplying heads to count. The heads are already stretching out to hungrily eye the mainland. Harry can tell from their low hissing, which imitates Parseltongue when they\u2019re in this form, that they\u2019re looking forwards to devouring Muggle homes and people.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Harry says again, and makes it a command, a reality. \u201c<em>Die down.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t reach for his wand. There\u2019s nothing about it that would help him. He speaks in Parseltongue, and the snakes turn and look down at him haughtily. They have eyes, technically, but those eyes are nothing but pure flame.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Die down.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The snakes give an angry hiss that changes into a scream as they feel his will clamp down on them. They writhe back and forth, trying to fling off the invisible iron bands, and Harry holds them more and more fiercely, tightens them and moves them <em>in</em>.</p>\n<p>He wants them to die down. He wants them to fade.</p>\n<p>He wants it so intensely that white light blots out his vision. But not before he sees one of the snakes simply disappear in a pop of sparks.</p>\n<p>Harry smiles, and moves a step forwards. He can hear the others calling out, but he can\u2019t understand them over the roaring of the fire and the press of his will.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Die.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The snakes wail, and then many of them grow smaller, all at once, as though Harry\u2019s <em>wanting </em>has stolen the top layer of flames from them. Harry knows that his mouth is probably locked in a crazed rictus, but he\u2019s walking towards them again, and they\u2019re backing away from him, and he feels the sweet burn of victory in his breast.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Die.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The snakes gather themselves together into a single tornado of fire and crash down towards him.</p>\n<p>Harry raises his arms above his head, not to shield, but to direct the force of his will up through his muscles and his fingers and his tendons and his bones\u2014utter rejection of everything the Fiendfyre wants to do at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Die.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The snapping, gaping mouths are inches away from him, and the fangs are lances of white fire that start to pierce his arm\u2014</p>\n<p>Just as they die. Harry stares at the smoke that is all that remains in the mess of superheated air, and he smiles.</p>\n<p>His will has prevailed.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s gone, and Harry crashes to his knees again. He can hear the alarmed shouts now, feel the hands on his shoulders shaking him, but he\u2019s unable to pay attention. There\u2019s a soft noise echoing in his ears that he has to listen to instead.</p>\n<p>It sounds like something tearing apart <em>inside </em>his brain tissue.</p>\n<p><em>Healer Hawken is going to be displeased, </em>Harry thinks a moment before pain and darkness eat him like the Fiendfyre.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are lucky you haven\u2019t permanently drained your ability to do magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of Healer Hawken\u2019s lecture hasn\u2019t made Harry flinch, because it\u2019s all the sort of thing he\u2019s heard before: \u201cYour life has value,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re reckless and careless,\u201d \u201cYou should have more care for yourself.\u201d But the thought of not being able to keep his promises to his oathsworn and defend those who need defending from Voldemort makes Harry wince.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t,\u201d Harry says, and Healer Hawken whips around to face him with such force that his own tail of hair hits him in the face.</p>\n<p>The Healer pushes it away from his cheek with a hiss and glares at Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part of my warning you\u2019re going to react to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs a little, deciding not to say anything about how it\u2019s the only new part. Then he winces again. Even a shrug hurts his shoulder. He\u2019s lying in a bed in the Hogwarts infirmary between what are essentially two huge Transfigured pillows, both of them pressing potion-soaked bandages against him. Apparently the injury to his magic means that he can\u2019t even drink potions the normal way and trust them to work with his innate power to heal him. He has to go through the slower method of absorbing them through the skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have enough people who are worried about you,\u201d Healer Hawken says in a low, deadly voice, \u201cthat I don\u2019t see any reason I should stay and scold you any longer. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do it far more effectively than I will.\u201d He pauses, apparently struggling with something, and then asks, \u201cWhat was so <em>urgent </em>that you couldn\u2019t wait a few more weeks until the magical concussion had gone away? It was healing. You were recovering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to destroy a powerful artifact that could have rendered a Dark wizard more dangerous,\u201d Harry says, and leans back to let one of the potions work more slowly into his skin. \u201cI was afraid that he would move it somewhere else if I waited, and I would have to find it all over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than that to destroy your magic or kill yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of those people who think everything is all right because they\u2019re still alive,\u201d Healer Hawken announces to the air, and then turns around and walks over to the door of Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office. \u201cI give up, he\u2019s <em>your </em>problem,\u201d Harry can hear him saying.</p>\n<p>Harry, meanwhile, closes his eyes and drifts for a minute. It\u2019s not going to last long, if only because he\u2019s sure to have more visitors, but it\u2019s soothing to feel the cool press of the potions. Even the blanket that\u2019s draped over him to cover his bare skin is coated with a thin layer of soft liquid.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Salvare?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I was right, that didn\u2019t last long, </em>Harry thinks, and opens his eyes to see Regulus and Severus standing in the doorway of the hospital wing. They\u2019re staring at him with eyes so huge that Harry has to smile at them. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em>not</em>,\u201d Severus says, his voice a frigid snap that reminds Harry of his own future\u2019s Severus Snape for the first time since he traveled back. \u201cI can smell\u2014they don\u2019t use <em>Amanita </em>mushrooms for anything shore of desperate cases! What did you <em>do</em>?\u201d He marches towards the bed and then stops and stares again, running his gaze up and down the bed and the blanket as if he can see every potion that Harry is taking. Well, absorbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe had a hemorrhage in his brain,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cThe cause was magical, but it did physical damage.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Severus gapes in silent outrage, Harry narrows his eyes at Regulus. That\u2019s too close to the exact phrasing that Healer Hawken used to content him. In fact, it <em>is </em>the exact phrasing. \u201cWhere did you hear that, Regulus? Were you listening at the door when Healer Hawken talked about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry continues staring at him. Regulus only looks back, the picture of innocence, before he adds, \u201cI was listening to him with an eavesdropping charm from the Slytherin common room.\u201d</p>\n<p>That distracts Severus enough from his fuming that he looks at Regulus. \u201cEavesdropping charms can\u2019t reach that far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you attach them to two objects, one of which is an <em>exact </em>copy of the other, and you leave the original object in the place you want to eavesdrop on while you keep the duplicate, they can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes and reaches up to massage his forehead. He <em>did </em>think that Regulus was oddly interested in Duplicating Charms, but he never thought about why.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little brat,\u201d says Severus in what sounds like wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, but at least now you know what\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cThere was also something about <em>acute magical exhaustion</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus continues studying Regulus in silence for a moment, and then faces Harry. His face has gone smooth and somber. He says, \u201cSir, I know that you don\u2019t want to hear it, but your death would have left us vulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo would not destroying the artifact that Voldemort had left on that island.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus swallows. His face is pale and haggard, and it suddenly occurs to Harry that he looks not only angry, but like he hasn\u2019t been getting enough sleep. \u201cSir\u2026we would have managed to survive somehow. Even if Riddle moved that artifact and we had to track it down again. But we wouldn\u2019t have survived the loss of <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Prince,\u201d Harry says softly. \u201cI promise that there wouldn\u2019t be a backlash down the conduits of the magical oaths. The ones we swore aren\u2019t that closely binding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t survive as an <em>alliance</em>,\u201d Severus says, his eyes burning with a deeper kind of anger now. \u201cIt\u2019s already been fractious in the days since we heard that you\u2019d returned to the school injured. Regulus\u2019s brother knows that his father went with you on that quest, and he was accusing Regulus of having deliberately set it up so that their father would destroy you, <em>just like a slimy Slytherin, </em>I believe were his words. Potter is spending all his time with Lupin, trying to persuade him to swear to you, but Lupin is reluctant to do it, and saying something about how he doesn\u2019t want to swear to a leader who could be taken down by a single trap. Tiberius is talking about how, if you die, we don\u2019t have a choice except to go to the Dark Lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s head spins for a second. He does say to Regulus, \u201cTell your brother that I\u2019d like to see him, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Regulus says, and leaves the hospital wing before Harry\u2019s glare can catch up with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re worrying about,\u201d Harry says to Severus. The thoughts in his brain move like ponies trying to canter through fudge. But it\u2019s important that he say this. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s possible that I\u2019ll fall in battle against Voldemort, or even die of something simple a few years from now. Dragonpox could fell me tomorrow, or I could trip down the stairs and break my neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus\u2019s glare intensifies. \u201c<em>Sir</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, hear me out.\u201d Harry has to keep his voice low as shouting would hurt his throat, but luckily, Severus listens to him with nothing more than an indignant huff. \u201cI want to build something that can survive my death, including an alliance and a way for the students who are growing up in the midst of war to have more choices. I thought I was further along that path than I am. Well, I\u2019ll have to work at it. But sooner or later, it <em>does </em>need to survive my death. I\u2019m not immortal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The walls sing at him. Harry feels a violent twitch enter his left eye, but luckily Severus can\u2019t hear the chime and ignores the twitch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus doesn\u2019t speak right away, and Harry nods to him. \u201cI know. It doesn\u2019t need to be right away. And I\u2019m going to do the best I can to be here as long as you need me to. I do want to emphasize, though, that I can\u2019t be the only linchpin that binds you together. That has to be your own strength and cohesion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus closes his eyes and swallows. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He pauses for a second, then opens his eyes again and gives Harry a complex look. \u201cIs that one reason you didn\u2019t want to be named as a lord? Because a lord\u2019s followers rarely reach a second generation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cYes. I have no interest in creating some kind of temporary political organization or social club. I have an interest in <em>you </em>reaching a brighter future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus looks overwhelmed, but whatever he might have said is overridden by the doors of the hospital wing flying back and Sirius running in, his hair trailing behind him like the mane of a wild horse and his eyes wide and frantic.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Salvare! You\u2019re <em>awake</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius looks as if he\u2019s going to fling himself onto the conjured pillows, but Severus catches his robe and yanks him back before he can. \u201cAn <em>injured </em>Professor Salvare, Black, don\u2019t jump on him,\u201d Severus hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that! I wasn\u2019t going to!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry has to admit he feels as doubtful as Severus on that point, but Severus snorts and lets go of Sirius\u2019s robe. Harry reaches out a hand and pats the edge of the bed, and Sirius comes over to lean against it, staring at him anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did my father do?\u201d he whispers. Well, if it\u2019s meant to be a confidential whisper, it fails, since it comes out more like a growl.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d Harry says. \u201cHe helped me. He was one of the reason that we were able to destroy the artifact we went in search of, and he helped the others who were with us to get me back to the hospital wing.\u201d They took him to St. Mungo\u2019s first, but it turned out that Albus had summoned Healer Hawken to Hogwarts, anticipating that Harry would return injured, and so he ended up back inside the walls of his first home.</p>\n<p>Sirius swallows. \u201cBut he\u2019s a Death Eater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I took him with me because I needed his help to get past a ward around the artifact\u2019s hiding place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd not\u2026\u201d Sirius\u2019s fingers twist into the edge of the blankets on the bed. \u201cNot because you\u2019re going to become his ally and make me go back home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Some part of Harry relaxes, although he can see Severus glaring at Sirius\u2019s back, probably because Sirius cares more about his own personal problems than Harry\u2019s injuries. \u201cOf course not. I won\u2019t make you live anywhere that you don\u2019t want to, Sirius, even if I <em>do </em>become allies with your father. You should get to make that decision. And my loyalty is always going to be to the people who swore to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would happen if he swore to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen he would have to learn to get along, and respect you, the same way you had to learn to get along with Mr. Prince and your brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius bows his head and nods. His breath leaves him in a long sigh. \u201cI knew that, I think. I just\u2014needed to make sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Harry pats Sirius\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m going to be well, and we\u2019ll defeat Voldemort and the Death Eaters once and for all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that include my father?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think your father is in hiding from Voldemort somewhere, if he\u2019s wise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius manages a wan smile, and he talks with Harry in a low voice about inconsequentialities for a few minutes, before he turns and leaves the hospital wing. He\u2019s already walking better, with his head lifted proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not to be soothed by <em>platitudes.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks and turns to Severus. \u201cDid I say that you were, Mr. Prince?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I </em>am not going to be soothed with pretty words like a child,\u201d Severus says. His eyes are blazing now with uncomplicated fury. \u201cI am going to keep an eye on you.\u201d He makes it sound like a curse.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus falters to a stop at what seems to be the beginning of a fine rant and stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to keep an eye on me, then you can. Not that I\u2019ll be in the classroom for a week or so, and it\u2019ll mean lots of visits to the hospital wing.\u201d Harry shifts to settle himself more comfortably in the bed. He suffered some burns despite the Fiendfyre not actually attacking him, simply from standing so close to its heat. \u201cBut after that, I could probably use someone to remind me that I\u2019m not immortal\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Hum, </em>go the walls. <em>Twitch, </em>goes Harry\u2019s eye.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014and that I\u2019ll accomplish more if I husband my magic and don\u2019t use it all at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus glares at him. Harry looks back with an innocent expression, and Severus finally nods and says, \u201cRight,\u201d but with less surety.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am glad I survived,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI promise, Mr. Prince, I never <em>meant </em>to die. It\u2019s simply that sometimes, dying is worth it if you can accomplish something greater with your death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTelling off Fiendfyre in Parseltongue isn\u2019t worth dying over!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think Regulus was the only one listening to that eavesdropping charm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus marches out in a version of high dudgeon that Harry knows is nothing compared with the real thing. He chuckles and closes his eyes. He has to rest.</p>\n<p>But at least he knows that he hasn\u2019t lost the regard of his oathsworn for the stupid risk he took, and that\u2019s everything.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry wakes up with something silky draped over his face. He scowls and reaches up to pluck it off, wondering if Pomfrey thought he needed the blanket over his head for some reason.</p>\n<p>But his hand touches something much softer and lighter than the blanket, and he pulls it away like a handful of nothing. Harry stares at the nothing, and then sighs as it wraps around his hand and his hand disappears.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he tells the Invisibility Cloak that\u2019s snuggling up with him.</p>\n<p>The Cloak curls around his hands and arms like a lost kitten.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou belong with the Potter line, and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Cloak wraps closer, with a wriggle that seems to say, <em>I know.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNot with me!\u201d Harry hisses, trying to pull the damn thing away from him. It\u2019s hard when he\u2019s wedged between potions pillows, weighed down by a blanket, and struggling with an Invisibility Cloak that\u2019s hard to see in the faint starlight as it is. \u201cYou know that I gave up the name Potter when I came here! I\u2019m Salvare now!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Cloak dives under the blanket and wraps itself around his chest, making some of the bandages disappear.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamnit,\u201d Harry mutters, and tears the Cloak off just as someone walks softly into the hospital wing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too late to pretend to be asleep, but then Harry sees it\u2019s not one of his students, so he doesn\u2019t have to. Fleamont Potter walks over to his bed and blinks down at him. \u201cI realize this is an unusual request, Professor Salvare, but you haven\u2019t seen an Invisibility Cloak anywhere, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s here, in fact,\u201d Harry says, shaking his head as he hands the damn thing over. He thinks he hears a distant wail, the way he keeps hearing buzzing from the Elder Wand when he\u2019s in Albus\u2019s office, but he ignores that. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know what attracted it. Perhaps the sheer volume of magic that\u2019s being put out to heal me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Fleamont takes the Cloak back slowly, studying Harry as if to pierce his way through Harry\u2019s skin. Harry blinks innocently at him, and Fleamont smiles a little and wraps the Cloak into a bundle that fits into his pocket. \u201cThis particular artifact has been in my family for a long time, and it\u2019s always had somewhat of a mind of its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cI can see that.\u201d If he shudders because he\u2019s thinking of the artifact with a mind of its own that he recently fought, Fleamont probably can\u2019t see it under the blankets, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Fleamont has his wand lit with a <em>Lumos </em>Charm, but that isn\u2019t enough to let Harry really make out the expression on his face. \u201cWell. Good night, Professor Salvare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Potter,\u201d Harry replies, and watches his grandfather, or would-be grandfather, walk out of the hospital wing again before he closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>He has so many other things to deal with, including the Lupin situation and how he\u2019ll get his classes caught up after the week\u2019s enforced rest and what Voldemort will do next, but right now, his body is so focused on sleep that he would be useless for anything else anyway.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I trust that you students will be <em>considerate </em>of the fact that Professor Salvare has suffered intense magical exhaustion, and not make your demands on him too frequent or unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those are possibly the worst words that Albus could have said at breakfast the day he came back, Harry reflects in exasperation as he leans back behind the desk. His students, even the ones who aren\u2019t sworn to him, are falling all over themselves to try and make sure that Harry isn\u2019t hurt or wounded or even having to perform basic magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to Summon that, Professor Salvare! Let me get it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me demonstrate that charm, sir. You just sit back and rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I stay and help with the second-year class, sir? I have a free period now, and you know that they always wear you out.\u201d</p>\n<p>James and Lily didn\u2019t even ask permission. They just showed up for his eight-o\u2019clock class the day after he was released from the hospital wing, the one with the first-year Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, and bracketed him and helped answer questions, and leaped to their feet every time Harry tried to stand up.</p>\n<p>By the end of that class, Harry is wearing a fixed smile, and he turns to Lily and James and says, \u201cMiss Evans, Mr. Potter, I appreciate your help, but I need to demonstrate the spells for the students.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, though, sir?\u201d Lily is very good at playing faux-innocent when she wants. Harry has the oddest flash of her doing the same thing when Petunia tried to ask her something, and has to blink, hard, to get the visions of his first timeline to fade away. \u201cWe can do that. And if we make a mistake, you\u2019re right there, and you can correct us.\u201d</p>\n<p>James pops around Lily and puts a glass down on the desk. Harry blinks at it. It\u2019s full of what looks, and smells, like warm milk. \u201cMr. Potter? I know that you didn\u2019t conjure that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I brought it down under a Preservation Charm from the hospital wing.\u201d James smiles winsomely at him. \u201cMadam Pomfrey says that you\u2019re supposed to drink something nutritious every two hours, and I thought you would ask for it. But you didn\u2019t. sir. So I brought it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks around for something to bang his head against, but he knows he wouldn\u2019t get far, with two solicitous students hovering over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Salvare? Aren\u2019t you going to drink your milk?\u201d Lily asks. \u201cI know that it has honey and a pain-killing potion in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a <em>pain-killing potion.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Lily raises her eyebrows. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t see you rubbing your head earlier, sir? As if you had a headache localized behind your forehead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hisses out and reaches for the glass of milk. Lily watches him closely as he drinks every bit of it, and James takes the glass when he\u2019s done, as if he thinks that Harry might try to break it in his frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make excellent overbearing parents someday,\u201d Harry mutters. He doesn\u2019t mean to. It just slips out.</p>\n<p>Lily blushes, and James shoots her a sly glance and puts an arm across her shoulders. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll be sure to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get fresh with me, Potter,\u201d Lily says, shoving his arm away, and stalking out of the classroom. James grins and follows her.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and leans back against his chair when they\u2019re gone, staring up at the ceiling. He thinks that he\u2019s done, and starts to stand up and get ready for his next class, which is third-year Gryffindors and Slytherins.</p>\n<p>The door opens, and Severus and Tiberius Wilkes march in. Harry stares at them, a little appalled.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Wilkes, I <em>know </em>you have Transfiguration right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tiberius smirks at him. \u201cProfessor McGonagall was happy to let me work ahead and turn in my essay early and then miss one class, sir. She says that a hero of the school deserves all the help he can get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help with the third-years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to take your next potions on time,\u201d Severus says, folding his arms. \u201cAnd you never know, a dragon could break through the walls and you would heroically leap into the line of fire to fight it. We\u2019re here to make sure we fight it instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scowls at him. Severus stares back at him. Harry is sure that he has a glass of charmed milk under a Preservation Charm waiting somewhere nearby, too.</p>\n<p>At least his headache is gone. Harry sighs and settles back in the chair behind his desk. This is the other side of swearing the oaths to protect and help, he reminds himself. He has to let his people help <em>him</em>, or it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ll become bitter and not achieve the future that he wants for them.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine,</em>\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe sounds exactly like my little sister when she\u2019s angry because a potion made her feel better,\u201d Tiberius tells Severus in a loud whisper.</p>\n<p>Harry glares at him, and Tiberius busies himself casting several of the standard safety charms that Harry uses at the beginning of every practical class. Severus stands at the side of his desk, eyeing everything in the room before he begins casting spells that stick to the desks to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Prince, floating desks are generally <em>not </em>a problem in a class full of third-years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not underestimating how much trouble you can get into,\u201d Severus says flatly.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think as I do, then.\u201d Albus rubs a hand over his blackened temples. He did try some of the spells that Harry recommended to him\u2014Harry doesn\u2019t have the strength right now to cast them himself\u2014and Harry can tell that the progress of the curse has slowed. But it hasn\u2019t stopped, and the Headmaster still wears a glamour everywhere outside of his office.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u201d Harry leans back in his chair and folds his hands on top of his chest. \u201cVoldemort thinks that he has only one Horcrux left if he\u2019s learned of the destruction of the diary, and he probably felt us cross the wards there, if nothing else. He would have gone to check. He\u2019ll come to Hogwarts for the diadem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus nods. \u201cWe must have a plan to contain him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one,\u201d Harry says quietly, and takes out the scroll that contains the spell the Unspeakables designed for him. He hands it over.</p>\n<p>Albus sprawls it open and reads it. His mouth parts a little, and then his eyes shine, and he chuckles. \u201cYes. And it\u2019s uniquely tailored to your strengths.\u201d He rolls the parchment up and hands it back to Harry. \u201cI only have two questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, it\u2019s blood magic. Are all of your followers going to agree to that? I know that you have both those who wield the Dark Arts and those who don\u2019t in your following, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s using their blood,\u201d Harry says firmly. \u201cAll of them are required to spill only a little to make the spell work. That\u2019s the point of having so many. The Unspeakables know that I\u2019ve sworn myself to lots of people. There won\u2019t be a requirement for anyone who\u2019s uncomfortable to participate. I\u2019ll have enough no matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I think I\u2019ve seen, in the last fortnight, that there are plenty of students in this school who would do anything they could to keep you from magically exhausting yourself.\u201d Albus only smiles innocently at him when Harry scowls a little. \u201cAs to my second question, can you tell me why my wand wants to fly across the office and bond with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs and doesn\u2019t bang his head on anything. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only powerful artifact that\u2019s attracted to me, Albus. I think it has something to do with my Parseltongue and the magic I have. One of the Horcruxes tried to approach me in much the same way. The Potters\u2019 Invisibility Cloak tried to <em>snuggle </em>with me when I was still recovering from my hemorrhage. I promise that I won\u2019t take your wand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus looks vaguely alarmed. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t take promises like that, my dear boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have that long to live, in any case,\u201d Albus says gently, and gestures at the mark of the diadem around his temples. \u201cAnd my wand is a powerful artifact. I suspect you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry meets his eyes evenly. \u201cI recognize elder wood when I see it, yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus only nods. \u201cI plan to retire at the end of the summer term,\u201d he murmurs, utterly surprising Harry. He thought the man would try to stay in his role as Headmaster as long as he could, even though it wouldn\u2019t be as long as it would have been if he\u2019d never been cursed. \u201cAnd I cannot think of anyone I trust to hold this wand more than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Time snickers.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cP-Professor Salvare, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks up, glad that for once his babysitters aren\u2019t present. \u201cYes, please come in, Mr. Lupin. I\u2019ve been expecting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus freezes for a second, then sits down in his usual desk. \u201cThe others told you that I was considering swearing to you?\u201d He licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, or joining the Order of the Phoenix. I\u2019m sorry if they\u2019ve put too much pressure on you. I think everyone should be free to choose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waits patiently. He thinks he might know what answer Remus is going to give him, or at least the answer he <em>wants </em>to give, if the way he avoids Harry\u2019s eyes is any indication. It only takes a few more minutes before Remus clenches his hands on the desk and looks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might be a werewolf, but I\u2019m not really violent,\u201d Remus says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not good a combat magic. I don\u2019t <em>want </em>to fight in this war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have to, Mr. Lupin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus has been drawing in breath to go on, but he lets it fade now, and stares at Harry in what looks like cold shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that everyone should fight in the war,\u201d Harry says. \u201cAnd I <em>don\u2019t </em>think they should do it against their will. I would be no better than Voldemort if I encouraged someone unwilling to swear an oath to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the fact that someone who\u2019s so reluctant to engage in fighting wouldn\u2019t be an asset on the battlefield anyway, but Harry won\u2019t say that to Remus. It would probably sting his Gryffindor pride, and might convince him to push himself forwards and do something he regrets later.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014but James has been saying that no one can really stand outside the war\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t just ignore it, that\u2019s true,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI think the people who refuse to believe that the Death Eaters and Voldemort are dangerous and tell the papers so are ridiculous. But you can sit it out, Mr. Lupin. With any luck, the final act of the war should happen soon, anyway. I\u2019ve harmed Voldemort too deeply for him to let it go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus is approaching a normal color again. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t fight with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I want you to do what makes <em>you</em> safe and happy, Mr. Lupin. Not stand with me just because the rest of your friends are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus looks at him with respect that\u2019s tempered with awe. Harry just smiles at him. The awe isn\u2019t enough to catapult Remus into being a warrior, and it shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s enough if he doesn\u2019t try to turn his friends away\u2014not that Harry thinks much could sway Sirius and James from their dedication\u2014and doesn\u2019t join the Death Eaters.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Remus breathes out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would be that easy. I would have come and talked to you a long time ago if I thought it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gets up from behind the desk and comes around it to pat Remus\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Mr. Lupin. And I hope that you won\u2019t let fear, or pressure from your friends, keep you from making decisions that you <em>want </em>to make in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus leaves his classroom with a lighter step and a lighter heart, which is all that Harry can really ask for.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Voldemort attacks Hogwarts with an army of Death Eaters on the second of May.</p>\n<p>(Harry is <em>highly not amused</em>).</p>\n<p>Albus is the one who knocks on the door of Harry\u2019s quarters to summon him, but Harry was already awake, feeling the gathering and swelling pulse of Dark magic that\u2019s rather like five or six diaries coming closer. Harry touches the parchment scroll at his belt and stands, opening the door and nodding to Albus as he finishes casting a few charms on his robes to make them more like battle armor. Fireproofing and waterproofing are the least of them.</p>\n<p>Harry becomes aware of a small clinking sound as they walk along, and glances back once to see a round shape roll into the shadow of a suit of armor and try to hide. Harry rolls his eyes. So it took months, but the Resurrection Stone managed to leave the ocean and come to Hogwarts.</p>\n<p>It can follow him all it likes. Harry is <em>not </em>going to take it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour oathsworn are ready?\u201d Albus asks quietly as they walk down the corridor towards the Great Hall, where Harry knows his students will be waiting. The soft awareness spreading through his oaths feels like excitement and hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many of them agreed to give their blood for this spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus stops walking and looks at him with wide eyes. Harry gives him a gentle smile that he tries to keep from being cheeky as best he can. Albus has many fine qualities, and he did apologize for doubting and fearing Harry, but he always looks so bloody <em>surprised </em>whenever a group of people has loyalty to someone that isn\u2019t him or Gryffindor House.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Albus says at last. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods and takes the lead, well-aware that Albus lets him. But it doesn\u2019t matter. When he opens the doors of the Great Hall, a roar goes up from several dozen throats that he knows is for him, and he pauses and bows to his people, humbled by their trust in him.</p>\n<p>The sixth- and seventh-years are at the forefront, with the few fifth-years behind them, and the adults in the back ranks. Well, minus Regulus, who is at the forefront and wriggling like an eager puppy. Harry directs a stern look his way, and Regulus calms and lifts his chin high.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for standing with me,\u201d Harry says simply. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that this battle will be easy, but we\u2019ll have a much greater chance together than apart, and with each of us giving a little blood, the easiest of all.\u201d He waves his wand to conjure a great porcelain basin in the middle of the Great Hall. Porcelain is magically neutral, and thus, the Unspeakables who designed the spell reported, would work best to collect the blood.</p>\n<p>Regulus bounces forwards first, of course, and Harry has to stop him from cutting his arm open to the bone, and insist that he pull back when he otherwise would have given too much. Severus is next, eyes shining, and then Evan, his head bowed, and Andromeda, striding up to the front as if daring someone to stop her, and Lucius and Narcissa right behind her\u2026</p>\n<p>They all look so <em>proud</em>, and Harry has to smile at them. He helped give that to them. He helped turn them into people they\u2019re proud to be.</p>\n<p>When the last fifth-year, a wide-eyed Ravenclaw named Elise Fawley, has finished depositing her blood in the basin, Harry cuts his own arm. Madam Pomfrey distributed enough Blood-Replenishing Potions to Professor Slughorn to handle everyone some time ago, and Slughorn moves through the room solemnly, giving out the potions. He doesn\u2019t want to be involved in the battle himself, but as far as Harry\u2019s concerned, he\u2019s doing more than enough.</p>\n<p>Harry scatters his own blood across the surface of the mingled liquid in the basin, and begins to hiss. The words make the blood bubble and jerk. Harry speaks the entire incantation, which is long and complex and doubles back on itself like a coiling serpent, in Parseltongue. The whole time, the blood boils and leaps up the sides of the basin.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Be a loyal servant for the duration of this battle,</em>\u201d Harry finishes, and steps back.</p>\n<p>Severus is right there with a Blood-Replenishing Potion and a demanding stare. Harry swallows it, rolls his eyes at him, and turns back to the basin in time to see the blood begin braiding itself upwards.</p>\n<p>The first curse from outside hits the wards, and the whole castle shudders. Harry remains calm, not looking away from the basin, confident that the plans he and Albus made for this eventuality are being followed. The younger students will have been herded to the Floos in the professors\u2019 offices the minute Albus confirmed Voldemort\u2019s approach, and the sixth- and seventh-years who can Apparate will have been taking others out down the tunnel to Honeydukes and leaving from there.</p>\n<p>The blood boils and twists, and then the magic takes hold all at once. The liquid slams together, crimson and brilliant as if still freshly-bled, and the younger students squeal. Severus tenses with anticipation next to Harry.</p>\n<p>A basilisk made of blood rises from the basin, twining its shimmering, thick-scaled neck in circles, horns and plume in dark scarlet rising from its smoothly-forming head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hello, beautiful,</em>\u201d Harry hisses, stepping forwards. The basilisk sways towards him, the Parselmouth whose blood it was the last to consume, and flicks out a long forked tongue that moves back and forth across the air like a scribble of ink. Harry touches the tongue, and it rasps across his palm hard enough to draw another drop of blood. The taste appears to satisfy it, and the basilisk lowers its head to the ground.</p>\n<p>Harry leaps atop it, balancing easily. Severus is not the only person scowling at him, but Harry ignores that. The blood in the beast recognizes and embraces him, and it\u2019s no more possible for him to fall from it than it is to fail to perform a Patronus.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Aim for the one that stinks of Dark Arts</em>,\u201d Harry tells the basilisk.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes,</em>\u201d the simple answer comes back, and again the serpent\u2019s tongue darts out, like a streak of red lightning.</p>\n<p>It glides straight out of the Great Hall, Harry ducking his head so that he can fit under the arched entrance. Behind him, he hears his oathsworn following, and Albus and the other professors who aren\u2019t supervising the student retreat. Harry straightens up and is glad that the basilisk bends enough that he doesn\u2019t need to duck as they leave the school.</p>\n<p>The whole point of this is to look impressive and terrifying. Ducking rather ruins the image.</p>\n<p>When the basilisk is beyond the doors, Harry can see the Death Eaters lined up on the road to Hogsmeade, beyond the gates of Hogwarts. There are rather fewer of them than Harry expected, which makes him smile.</p>\n<p>Voldemort is standing alone at the front, hurling curses at the wards. He pauses when he sees Harry, and stares at the basilisk in rage. Harry wishes he could see the fear mingled in with the anger, but he doubts Voldemort would ever openly show it.</p>\n<p>Harry commands the basilisk to halt in Parseltongue, and it does, head swaying back and forth. Harry rides the swaying easily, and smiles at Voldemort. Voldemort\u2019s eyes dart back and forth between him and the snake.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Tom,\u201d Harry says.</p>\n<p>As he hoped and suspected, the words fling Voldemort into a rage. He screams, and rushes forwards, hammering a swift assault of spells that brings down a portion of the wards. His Death Eaters follow him, although they\u2019re conspicuously trying to avoid Harry and his blood-basilisk and aiming for the students instead.</p>\n<p>Harry draws in a deep breath. He has to trust, he has to <em>hope, </em>that their fighting skills and those of the professors will hold.</p>\n<p>He has Voldemort to worry about.</p>\n<p>Voldemort has obviously taken the time to study the basilisk\u2019s composition, and he flings out a charm that\u2019s not a bad choice, one used for drying liquids quickly. Harry touches the basilisk\u2019s head and gestures forwards, and it rushes him over and down, moving with the deadly swiftness that Harry remembers from the Chamber of Secrets.</p>\n<p>Voldemort dodges the first strike of its fangs, and Harry flings an Entrail-Expelling Curse that makes Voldemort dash back in the other direction. He tries several lightning bolts after that, and Voldemort manages to dodge all of them, coming closer and closer to the basilisk.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever knew you were such a good dancer, Tom,\u201d Harry tells him cheerfully.</p>\n<p>Voldemort screams, \u201c<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk rears and takes the curse for Harry, positioning its neck in between. Harry knows that it won\u2019t kill the creature, but the curse does make several large scales of blood fly away from it, which causes the basilisk to shrink. Harry needs to make sure that he can kill Voldemort before it\u2019s gone altogether.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Use your gaze,</em>\u201d Harry tells the basilisk as quietly as he can.</p>\n<p>The Unspeakables warned him that this spell wouldn\u2019t create a basilisk that has all the traits of the real one; it will expend more magic to use them. But that contented Harry well enough, since he didn\u2019t want the basilisk Petrifying all his allies anyway.</p>\n<p>And he doesn\u2019t think the Petrification will kill Voldemort or freeze him. But he\u2019ll take slowing him down.</p>\n<p>The gaze does make Voldemort slow, weaving back and forth in place for a moment, his wand uplifted. Harry places his hand on the basilisk\u2019s head and snaps, \u201c<em>Now.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The basilisk plunges down, committing everything to the power of the dive.</p>\n<p>Voldemort dashes to one side again, laughing maniacally. But he\u2019s too focused on the basilisk to realized that along with its fangs coming closer to him, Harry, balancing sturdily on its head, is doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>Harry hurls another lightning bolt, but this time, it takes Voldemort broadside.</p>\n<p>Voldemort screams as he goes flying backwards, his limbs moving in odd, jerky patterns. The basilisk lifts its fangs from where they\u2019re embedded in the grass and turns about with a snap of its tail.</p>\n<p>Voldemort holds Harry\u2019s gaze as the fangs come towards him. There\u2019s no acceptance in his gaze, no peace at the thought of death. Harry didn\u2019t think there would be. There\u2019s hatred, and fear as hot as Fiendfyre.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>This is not the end</em>,\u201d Voldemort says in Parseltongue.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The diadem is gone, Tom.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Voldemort\u2019s eyes widen, and he screams in the seconds before the basilisk\u2019s fangs pierce him.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t know if the venom that a conjured blood-beast can give will be enough to kill Voldemort. He\u2019s not going to take any chances. He jumps off the basilisk\u2019s head as it dissolves from the effort of pouring forth the venom, and calls Fiendfyre for one, last time.</p>\n<p>This time, it forms a gryphon which consumes Voldemort. He screams only one more time, and then his voice fades into the churning of the flames.</p>\n<p>Harry never lets them get out of control. He calls them back with a sharp snap, and turns about, studying the battle and seeing who needs the most help.</p>\n<p>His students are fighting magnificently, working in pairs and trios and little groups that flow and break apart as necessary to go to each other\u2019s aid, working the way Harry taught them in class. Evan takes down a large Death Eater that Harry suspects might be his father with a kick to the groin. Lily and James are fighting side-by-side, ignoring the large bloody scratches both of them bear, and breaking the kneecaps of two witches in bone-white masks with loud snaps. Severus has blinded someone who might be Walburga Black with a spray of red potion, and is busily binding her so hard that she won\u2019t be able to rise.</p>\n<p>Sirius and Regulus are back-to-back, and a circle of Death Eaters are backing away from them, unnerved. Even as Harry watches, some of Voldemort\u2019s forces turn and flee, probably overwhelmed by the death of their lord.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s heart beats with fierce pride. It looks like the Battle of Hogwarts might have few causalities aside from Voldemort himself.</p>\n<p>But even as he thinks that, he hears a high, cackling voice that\u2019s horribly familiar, and Bellatrix, her mask gone and her hair streaming behind her from the force of her run, heads straight towards Regulus.</p>\n<p>Sirius gets in the way, and they begin to duel in a complicated, swirling pattern that Harry recognizes at once.</p>\n<p>The Department of Mysteries. Part of that battle is happening again, here, on the grass in the bright morning.</p>\n<p>Harry begins to run. He doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll get there in time, but he gives himself more speed and more energy than he has since he woke in the bed in the hospital wing, bounding along, his robes whipping his ankles.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Die, </em>little cousin!\u201d Bellatrix finally shrieks, when she tries a purple whip of fire that Sirius foils with an easy shield.</p>\n<p>Harry continues running, in dread every second to see a red spell unwind from her wand.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Avada Kedavra</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chimes sing loudly in Harry\u2019s ears as he flings himself in a low tackle, hitting Sirius\u2019s legs and knocking him out of the path of the curse\u2014</p>\n<p>And himself into it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry opens his eyes to white.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come <em>on</em>,\u201d Harry says, and sits up.</p>\n<p>The whiteness swirls around him. Harry looks back and forth, wondering what happens next. A train? (Although this place isn\u2019t solid enough to look like King\u2019s Cross). Or Albus Dumbledore coming over to him, beaming? (Even though Albus isn\u2019t dead in this timeline).</p>\n<p>Maybe Death itself coming to greet him?</p>\n<p>But instead, three shadows appear, slowly becoming firmer and more solid. Harry raises his eyebrows at the way the Cloak spreads out beneath the Elder Wand, and the Resurrection Stone lies on top of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Harry says.</p>\n<p>They all buzz at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize that you have a family?\u201d Harry says to the Cloak. \u201cAnd you have a wielder?\u201d he says to the Wand. \u201cAnd I already rejected you?\u201d he says to the Stone.</p>\n<p>Soft chimes sound, and then Harry hears a deep, dreamy voice, which doesn\u2019t really sound like Trelawney\u2019s, reciting words that echo and reel back and forth in the still air.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The Dark Lord\u2019s Bane, the one who has thrice defied him, thrice spoken his will with snakefire, and thrice freed a Death Eater from service, will face the choice of three.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did <em>not </em>thrice free a Death Eater from service,\u201d Harry says crossly. \u201cIt was only two. I only changed Lucius\u2019s Dark Mark, and Orion Black\u2019s. That was <em>all</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chimes murmur, and if Harry listens hard enough, he can hear the name <em>Abraxas Malfoy.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change his Dark Mark! I just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stops. <em>Scared him enough that he would probably never return to Voldemort\u2019s service.</em></p>\n<p>Harry sighs as he stares at the Deathly Hallows. He gave them up in his first timeline because he never wanted to be a lord, or a title, or a Master of Death. He would have given up the title of the Boy-Who-Lived if he knew how to do it.</p>\n<p>And in a way, didn\u2019t he? By coming back in time, to where people might be mental about him in other ways, but no one knows him as Harry Potter, the Chosen One, the Boy-Who-Lived.</p>\n<p>But now\u2026</p>\n<p>He knows that he can survive if he claims the Hallows.</p>\n<p>And he won\u2019t if he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Time likes symmetry. The Battle of Hogwarts <em>shouldn\u2019t </em>have taken place on the same day as the one in his timeline except twenty-one years earlier, but it did. Bellatrix <em>shouldn\u2019t </em>have been at the battle to fight Sirius the way she did in the Department of Mysteries\u2014Harry didn\u2019t even think she\u2019d escaped from Ministry custody\u2014but she was. He <em>shouldn\u2019t </em>have this choice, but he does.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s not fool enough to turn away from it merely because he doesn\u2019t like being Master of Death or a Lord, not when he wants to live to see his students succeed, to see Narcissa and Lucius\u2019s child born, to help Albus as long as he can.</p>\n<p>To go on being Professor Henry Salvare, the person he <em>chose </em>to be.</p>\n<p>The Deathly Hallows buzz at him.</p>\n<p>Harry sighs, and stoops, and picks them up.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is <em>wrong </em>with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks and stares up at Healer Hawken. The man leaped back from the hospital bed when Harry opened his eyes, and swore in several creative ways that Harry never heard before. Now he\u2019s pacing back and forth with his hands pulling at his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough to make me retire from Healing!\u201d he\u2019s currently ranting.</p>\n<p>Harry clears his throat with difficulty. \u201cCan I have a glass of water?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawken conjures it for him and brings it over, but he\u2019s still ranting. \u201cWhat the fuck <em>happened</em>? You don\u2019t recover from a Killing Curse! Except if you\u2019re Oh-So-Special-Professor Henry Salvare, I suppose, look at<em> me</em>, riding a blood-basilisk into battle and completely disregarding my health\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sips the water and ignores him. He can hear the running feet drawing closer. He suspects that, just as his oathsworn felt the magical and emotional fluctuations through the oaths before, they can feel that he\u2019s alive now.</p>\n<p>Regulus flings the doors open and pounces on him in the way that Sirius managed to avoid last time. Healer Hawken starts yelling at him in turn. Regulus doesn\u2019t seem to care or hear, and Harry doesn\u2019t listen. Regulus is pushing his face into Harry\u2019s robes, and Harry can feel the tears he\u2019s shedding.</p>\n<p>He looks up in time to see Severus leaning against the doors of the hospital wing, half-collapsed, and the way his tears aren\u2019t shed.</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. Hearing the contented buzz of the Deathly Hallows in his ears and the chiming from the walls and the rants of his outraged Healer is a small price to pay.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t explain the nature of his new circumstances to <em>everyone</em>, using a combination of bollocks about Parseltongue and how his oaths to Sirius and Regulus, both members of the Black family, allowed him to resist a Black\u2019s Killing Curse, but a few people are owed more than that.</p>\n<p>The knock comes on the door of his quarters, right on time.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease come in, Mr. Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looks up with a smile as Fleamont steps in. Fleamont nods and gives him a half-smile back. He sits down in the chair opposite Harry. \u201cYou said this had something to do with our Invisibility Cloak? That now we can\u2019t find anywhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Potter, but\u2014did you know your Cloak was one of the Deathly Hallows?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont\u2019s eyes widen, but he doesn\u2019t look overly surprised. \u201cThat would explain a lot,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI did know that Albus carried the Elder Wand, but no one I knew of had ever seen the Resurrection Stone. You\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019ve united the Hallows?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. \u201cYes, sir. The Resurrection Stone was in an artifact that belonged to Tom Riddle\u2019s ancestors, and after I cleansed it of Dark magic, it became\u2014well, attached to me. I suppose that increased the attachment the other two Hallows had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Fleamont settles back in his chair, thoughtful. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that James will accept the news as gracefully as I can, but I\u2019m relieved that the Cloak is in safe hands.\u201d His eyes abruptly pierce Harry. \u201cAnd in the hands of a Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry chokes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you, that night in the hospital wing.\u201d Fleamont stares at him. \u201cI won\u2019t press you for explanations right now. I think that you\u2019ve become used to keeping your secrets. But I would be honored to know you in any capacity that I can. As family.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMy father\u2019s name was Henry, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m aware.\u201d Harry clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrandson,\u201d Fleamont breathes. \u201cI should have seen it before. Those damn green eyes\u2014so my James marries his Lily, does he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat timeline is gone, sir,\u201d Harry says, his voice harsher than he means it to be, colder. But he doesn\u2019t want\u2014maybe someday he can tell James and Lily, but for now, he doesn\u2019t want them to look at him as they would if they knew. \u201cThey might not get married, they might never have a son, he might not look like me. Please don\u2019t tell them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Fleamont says. \u201cBut I meant what I said about knowing you as family, and outside a professional capacity. Consider it. We can claim you as a distant relative, but\u2014consider it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The yearning in his eyes is so real that Harry has to look away for a minute. He nods. \u201cAll right. But\u2014what did you mean outside a professional capacity, sir? Are you coming to teach here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fleamont snorts. \u201cNo. I did mention that I\u2019m on the Board of Governors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry narrows his eyes. \u201cIn that first confusing conversation, yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Fleamont, Henry, the \u2018sir\u2019 is ridiculous. And we\u2019ll know each other in a professional capacity because the Board\u2019s been told that Albus is stepping down as Headmaster. Minerva McGonagall will become Headmistress, of course. She\u2019s more than earned it, putting up with Albus\u2019s nonsense all these years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Harry asks suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need a Deputy, Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Harry says, appalled. \u201cI\u2019ve only been here two years! You should appoint Professor Flitwick, or Slughorn, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlughorn would be a disaster,\u201d Fleamont says flatly. \u201cWe\u2019ve all discussed this, Henry. You might only have been at Hogwarts two years, but you\u2019re the one who has the qualities. Quality <em>will </em>reveal itself. Talent will out. And it\u2019s nice when it actually does, and we don\u2019t have to manufacture it, or promote someone who\u2019s only in that position because of their family name.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That means that someday I\u2019ll be Headmaster, </em>Harry thinks in horror. <em>Probably. </em></p>\n<p>Time, which wants him to take Dumbledore\u2019s place, gives the loudest snicker he\u2019s ever heard from it.</p>\n<p>Harry clears his throat. \u201cI suppose that Governors who\u2019ve discussed it include Abraxas Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. He was one of the most enthusiastic, oddly enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighs. He did want to stop making decisions out of spite, or just to avoid power. \u201cAll right, I accept. Keep in mind that I might be a disaster, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Fleamont stands up, looking victorious. \u201cWe look forward to your assuming the position with the beginning of the next school year.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates, and Harry looks up at him. Fleamont takes two quick steps forwards and puts his hands on Harry\u2019s shoulders in what\u2019s not quite a hug, but not far away from one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m proud to welcome you to the family,\u201d Fleamont whispers.</p>\n<p>Harry never thought that anyone who wasn\u2019t an Unspeakable would know he had time traveled. Now he makes another decision, and stands, and hugs his grandfather back.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><em>THE MAN-WHO-CONQUERED! </em>blares the headline on the front page of the <em>Daily Prophet.</em></p>\n<p>Harry laughs, because he has to, and lets the paper drop. He leans his elbows on the parapets of the Astronomy Tower, staring out over the grounds. There were indeed few casualties in the battle, and none of his oathsworn, and the wounds left by his Fiendfyre and his basilisk have already been healed over. The air hovers around him, soft and warm with a June-to-be. The night sky above him is bright and clear. Harry can see all the stars.</p>\n<p>The Dark Mark will never hover over that Tower. Albus Dumbledore will never fall to his death from it. He might live only a few years longer, but he won\u2019t die in agony and pain.</p>\n<p>Severus Snape\u2014Severus Prince, now\u2014will never call his best friend a Mudblood, or become a Death Eater, or have to curse his employer to death under the weight of multiple Unbreakable Vows.</p>\n<p>Regulus Black will never drown in a lake full of Inferi.</p>\n<p>James Potter and Lily Evans will never die in a cottage at Godric\u2019s Hollow under Voldemort\u2019s wand.</p>\n<p>Evan Rosier will never perish at the hands of Mad-Eye Moody.</p>\n<p>Sirius Black will never go to Azkaban. He\u2019ll never be a fugitive. He\u2019ll never fall through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries.</p>\n<p>Remus Lupin might never marry Nymphadora Tonks\u2014now an adorable toddler who changes her hair to imitate Harry\u2019s every time she sees him\u2014but he won\u2019t perish in the Battle of Hogwarts, either.</p>\n<p>Peter Pettigrew will never become a traitor or spend years of his life as a rat.</p>\n<p>Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy will not spend months under threat in their own home, watching Nagini devour people. Maybe they won\u2019t have Draco, either. But Harry hopes they will, and that Draco Lucius Malfoy will be a <em>normal </em>spoiled little prat.</p>\n<p>(And a little brother. Narcissa told him yesterday that he will be godfather to Henrietta Andromeda Malfoy and that he\u2019s going to like it. Harry found it much easier to accept that <em>fait accompli </em>than some of the others).</p>\n<p>Andromeda Tonks might never have her grandson Teddy, but she\u2019s not going to lose her husband, daughter, and son-in-law to a devastating war, either.</p>\n<p>Fabian and Gideon Prewett are going to live. Molly Weasley\u2019s children will know their uncles.</p>\n<p>Hermione and Ron will grow up in peace.</p>\n<p>And Harry Potter will never be the Chosen One.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll never be the anonymous Defense Against the Dark Arts professor he planned on becoming, either. But he thinks he can live with that.</p>\n<p>Footsteps sound on the stairs behind him, and Harry glances over. Regulus is standing there, staring at him with determination.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Hawken says you\u2019re not supposed to strain yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s straining myself about standing on the Astronomy Tower, Mr. Black,\u201d Harry says, rolling his eyes. They\u2019re not in class, he can get away with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might take it into your head to jump over the edge,\u201d Regulus says. \u201cWe never know what mental thing you\u2019ll do next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompared to swearing all the vows that you wanted me to, Mr. Black, nothing I do is mental,\u201d Harry mutters, and walks over to Regulus. Regulus only relaxes when Harry is walking down the stairs next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, sir, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus\u2019s voice is soft and uncertain. Harry looks at him, at his slightly averted eyes, and is reminded that, just because Regulus Black will never drown in a lake of Inferi, it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019ll have a perfect life, either.</p>\n<p>Harry still has work to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Regulus,\u201d he says, and reaches out to ruffle the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cIt was a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regulus beams at him, and dashes down the stairs ahead of him, probably to set up some kind of ambush or warn other oathsworn that Harry is coming.</p>\n<p>Harry shakes his head, and follows him, down to the life and the world that he chose.</p>\n<p>Time sings like a happy child.</p>\n<p><b>The End</b>.</p>"
