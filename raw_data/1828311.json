  "text": "<p>When Shouyou\u2019s born it\u2019s with beautiful red and gold on his collarbone, small on his sticky new-born skin and the lines not yet curled together like they\u2019ll grow to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d His mother says the first time she sees it properly while cradling him close. \u201cThat\u2019s not a name, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not. It\u2019s hard to tell what it is yet \u2013 what it will come to be \u2013 but it\u2019s easy to see that it\u2019s not a name in this language nor any other.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s starting off difficult already,\u201d His father agrees with a sigh, pushing his glasses up his nose so that the words like ink on the back of his wrist catch the light, spelling <em>Mariko </em>in beautiful dainty purple in the same way the little inscription on his wife\u2019s neck says <em>Takashi</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy precious boy,\u201d his mother sighs against his fluffy infant head as she rocks him in her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give us a world of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou blinks at her blankly and coos, grabbing with chubby fingers at her blouse. His mother smiles at him and rubs one slender finger along the shapeless lines on his skin like she could will them to resolve themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cTakashi,\u201d she says absently to her husband. \u201cStill, don\u2019t you think his Mark will grow to be quite beautiful? I\u2019ve never seen one in colors like that before. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he ponders as he leans forward to smooth a hand along his son\u2019s fat cheek. \u201cThey say those without names grow up to be blessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is how Shouyou comes into the world; in red and gold and ready to be blessed.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>They say it can take up to a decade for someone\u2019s Mark to become clear, but Shouyou\u2019s more or less flows itself together a week before his ninth birthday; a string of royal colors flush on his skin that makes everybody he surrounds himself with curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain Shouyou,\u201d His mother scolds the first time Shouyou asks for something to keep it covered with. \u201cYou\u2019re unique, there\u2019s no shame in that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says awkwardly, rubbing at it with a finger. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>ashamed </em>of it. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t like people staring at it all the time. I mean, it means I belong to someone, right? It doesn\u2019t feel right to share it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother pauses in the middle of folding the washing and stares at him for a moment, her wide hazel eyes reflected back at her in the face of her son. Shouyou hesitates for a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did I say something weird again?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother blinks and shakes her head, like waking from a daze. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d She places the dress of his sister\u2019s she\u2019d been folding back into the basket and crouches so she\u2019s at his own eye level, folding her skirts neatly into her knees. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I forget you\u2019re growing up so fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom,\u201d Shouyou says awkwardly and his face goes nearly as red as his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d She says, rubbing a thumb along Shouyou\u2019s cheek that is still fluff with baby fat and smiling at the way he wrinkles up his face at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. If you don\u2019t want other people to see it, that\u2019s your right. It\u2019s just a pity. It\u2019s very lovely to look at.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou frowns at that and moves to slap one hand over the crest. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d he almost snaps. \u201cIt feels like everybody else has a name <em>but</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouyou,\u201d his mother sighs, exasperated but patient because it\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve had this conversation since Shouyou was old enough to understand about Marks and Soulmates. \u201cEverybody\u2019s Mark is different, okay? And they say having one without a name is a sign of good fortune.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Shouyou insists. \u201cI have a picture and a word but no name.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother pauses. \u201cWhat do you mean a word?\u201d She asks. Shouyou shuffles a little where he stands like a guilty child and casts his gaze everywhere but at her. \u201cShouyou,\u201d she repeats. \u201cWhat do you mean a word?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou bites his lip before sighing and tugging his shirt collar a little to the side to show his mother the Mark just past the curve of his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s been like this for a while,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a while since Mariko had looked at her son\u2019s Mark in earnest. Shouyou was long past the age where she needed to help him change or wrestle him into the bathtub, and although he was admittedly clumsy and a little bit off-kilter on his own feet, he was also fiercely self-driven and independent.</p>\n<p>His Mark was as she remembered it from the last time she\u2019d gotten a close look \u2013 although heaven knows how long ago that was \u2013 but it was clearer now, much more woven together in its intricate red and gold, but it was the scrawl of barely legible writing beneath it that attracted her attention. It was wrapped so tightly along the symbol on his skin it was almost impossible to notice it unless one was looking for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathes in surprise, tracing along it with a fingernail as she tries to sound out the foreign hiss of the letters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shouyou asks as his mother huffs out sounds.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of your Mark,\u201d she says after a moment, giving up and pulling back so she could drag Shouyou\u2019s shirt closed again. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen one in a good long while. They\u2019re not so common these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou wrinkles his nose at her like she\u2019s talking in riddles and Mariko realizes she might as well be. Her son is not quite nine and doesn\u2019t yet know much about Soulmates and Marks. \u201cIt\u2019s the meaning of your Mark,\u201d she says and he just looks more confused. \u201cThe language has been dead for centuries by now, but those who were so lucky as to be Marked with a symbol instead of a name used to get an inscription to match.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Shouyou blinks. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I have?\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother smiles and stands, ruffling his hair a little. \u201cIt looks like it,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want me to try and have it translated for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shouyou says, and Mariko realizes he\u2019s already losing interest in the conversation. Her son\u2019s attention is a lot like a flickering candle, and there\u2019s no telling when the light of his interest will turn to shadow. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, so long as it\u2019s not weird I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m going out to play for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d she agrees amusedly as she turns to go back to the washing, watching Shouyou scurry out of the kitchen in a flurry of hands and feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d He exclaims, rocketing to a stop at the doorway and grabbing at the frame for support as he smiles sheepishly over his shoulder at her. \u201cCan I have something to cover it with now now?\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>As Shouyou grows up he almost forgets about his Mark altogether. His attention shifts to volleyball and tournaments and the sound his hand makes when he slaps a ball against the court. He could care less about this girly Soulmate nonsense. As far as he\u2019s concerned twelve is much too young to worry about his future anyway, and his Soulmate will come when they come.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible,\u201d Izumi remarks one day as Shouyou focuses on the ball he\u2019s bouncing on the heels of his wrists. \u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit curious about your Soulmate? I mean, with a mark as unusual as yours they\u2019ve got to be pretty extraordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou shrugs but doesn\u2019t stop bouncing. \u201cThat\u2019s all way off. Right now a Mark is just a mark. Anyway, are you sure you won\u2019t come to the tournament with \u2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izumi says and that ends the conversation there.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Shouyou meets Kageyama at his first ever tournament outside the bathrooms with anger making his brain numb and something unsettling that he pins as his nerves in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came here to win,\u201d he declares with all the seriousness he can muster and for the briefest moment he swears he sees Kageyama\u2019s eyes widen just a fraction but the subsequent blow off and the way he treats Shouyou like a kid playing pretend destroys any and all hopes of a good first impression.</p>\n<p>Shouyou has never met somebody so arrogant in all his life, and when he hears him referred to as \u2018<em>King of the Court</em>\u2019 he can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s fitting. Not because the name is cool enough to make him squirm but because Kageyama is <em>not</em>. He\u2019s somebody who seems so superior that even those who stand on even ground with him seemed cowed.</p>\n<p>Shouyou pities his teammates something fierce and admits to himself that half the reason Kageyama makes him so furious is the way he takes everything around him for granted.</p>\n<p>Shouyou would kill for a team \u2013 for somebody to toss him the ball and pat him on the back when he manages to spike it into the ground \u2013 but Kageyama treats those things like dirt, and something about that rubs him the wrong way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand that guy,\u201d he mutters under his breath as they march into their starting lineups and Izumi shoots him a curious look from the corner of his eye but doesn\u2019t say anything in return.</p>\n<p>The referee blows the whistle and Kageyama hoists the ball up high.</p>\n<p>The game begins.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Afterwards Shouyou clutches at the net and tries to breathe through the way his chest is too tight and his throat too small.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing short of a slaughter \u2013 a massacre.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time Shouyou\u2019s had his dreams thrown back in his face by reality. He can come back from this. In a moment he\u2019ll go back to being the happy-go-lucky redhead that everybody expects him to be, but right now he just needs a moment to pull himself together.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sound of sneakers squeaking on polished maple floorboards and Shouyou looks up just as the net rattles to the sound of somebody on the other side leaning against it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Kageyama and for a moment Shouyou can\u2019t do anything but stare because whatever words he wants to say stick strangely in the scrape of his throat.</p>\n<p>It might be the first time Shouyou\u2019s been close enough and calm enough to really look at him. He\u2019s still tall and he\u2019s still frightening, but there\u2019s a look in his eyes that makes it even harder for Shouyou to catch his breath. It\u2019s something furious and angry and Shouyou can\u2019t quite figure out who it\u2019s directed to.</p>\n<p>The little scrap of gold and red on his collarbone burns white hot for a reason that he can\u2019t explain.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em>,\u201d Kageyama hisses and it\u2019s only the fear that keeps Shouyou from flinching. \u201cJust what have you been doing for the past three years?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that stings. Stings more than it should because Kageyama is just some stupid kid who he met a bare hour ago who doesn\u2019t know how to share or play nice or anything about being a decent human being. It shouldn\u2019t hurt \u2013 not something like that from someone like that \u2013 but it does.</p>\n<p>Kageyama turns and heads back to the lineup but it\u2019s a long moment before Shouyou can move.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Shouyou spends the next year slapping balls until his palms bleed.</p>\n<p>He still doesn\u2019t have a team \u2013 nobody to toss him the ball or pat him on the back \u2013 but Shouyou throws himself into his training with a kind of mad fanaticism anyway. Every time he feels so exhausted he thinks his knees might give he remembers Kageyama\u2019s face behind the shadows of the net and the sharp hiss of his voice.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What have you been doing for the past three years?</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all the drive Shouyou needs to carry him through the rest of junior high. It carries him all the way through graduation and then enrollment in high school. It carries him right up to the gym door of Karasuno even.</p>\n<p>The drive to beat Kageyama\u2019s pretty boy face into the ground and make him <em>recognize </em>him propels him up until the second where that gym door rattles open.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s Kageyama dressed in the exact uniform Shouyou\u2019s wearing; shoulders curved and neck arched perfectly backwards as he leaps for a ball mid-serve.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou!\u201d Shouyou shrieks as his visions of destroying Kageyama and his title <em>of King of the Court</em> fade into dust before his eyes.</p>\n<p>Kageyama falters midflight, turning to look at Shouyou in amazement as his feet touch the ground again and the ball drops to hit him on the back of the head.</p>\n<p>Shouyou wishes he could find that funny. It\u2019s surprising how much he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Kageyama mutters and for a terrifying moment Shouyou thinks that Kageyama has forgotten him, that while Kageyama had been the drive behind Shouyou\u2019s mad flight to succeed he was barely a blip on the outside of Kageyama\u2019s consciousness.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember me,\u201d he starts, a mix between awkward and angry, to which Kageyama cuts him off without missing a beat:</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He remembers him</em>. Shouyou\u2019s heart does something a little funny in his chest \u2013 like a volleyball spinning much too high across the air \u2013 but when Kageyama opens his mouth to spew out a verifiable landslide of insults it\u2019s pretty much downhill from there.</p>\n<p>Shouyou hates this guy.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Kageyama says during one of their evening practices while they prepare for the three-on-three. \u201cWhy do you want to play volleyball so badly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou is so surprised he misses the toss, wincing as it bounces badly off his arms and off to roll into the line of trees behind them. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was their second night of grudging practice and probably the first time Kageyama had spoken to him with a sentence that didn\u2019t start with an insult. So far he\u2019d treated Shouyou like necessary baggage. Shouyou was needed to obtain entry into the club, but he wasn\u2019t wanted.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d made that much at least clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Kageyama continues, apparently unconcerned he\u2019d just called their hissy fit of a practice session to an unscheduled stop. \u201cIt\u2019s not even like you\u2019re <em>good </em>at it. You\u2019ve got some nice reflexes, but no talent for the sport. You\u2019d work just as well in basketball or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment Shouyou can\u2019t see through a haze of red rage. How <em>dare </em>Kageyama say something like that to him when Kageyama has a long documented history of being completely insufferable? Sure, Kageyama might have the natural talent for the sport that Shouyou lacks, but his way with people has left that talent compromised.</p>\n<p>Shouyou more than anybody knows how essential a team is to victory. One person can\u2019t play the whole court on his own, no matter how hard he tries.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s on the tip of tongue to blurt as much out when he comes to the realization that Kageyama looks <em>curious</em>. He\u2019s not being mean, Shouyou realizes, just obtuse that he\u2019s being rude. Or maybe he simply doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Shouyou isn\u2019t a person given to prolonged fits of anger. Usually he wasn\u2019t given to fits of anger at all, but Kageyama was especially talented at drawing out the worst in people.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it was just Shouyou.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get what you mean,\u201d he says after a moment of carefully considering Kageyama\u2019s frustrated but not angry expression. \u201cI mean, I <em>kind </em>of get what you mean but not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Kageyama grits out between his teeth. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter to you whether you play volleyball or something else, right? It\u2019d be the same either way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou looks at him for a moment \u2013 at the irritated slant of his eyes and the way his hair is falling unevenly across his forehead after three hours of tossing and slamming \u2013 and wonders if Kageyama is actually this dumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shouyou says after a pregnant pause. \u201cI suppose I could play another sport. But I don\u2019t want to. I mean, I don\u2019t really have a natural talent for anything in particular \u2013 not like you \u2013 so what does it matter if I pick one sport out of the rest? I love volleyball and that\u2019s enough. If you play a sport because you think you\u2019re obligated to, then aren\u2019t you just wasting everybody\u2019s time to begin with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama stares at him blankly for a moment and Shouyou wonders if he\u2019s just said something really stupid.</p>\n<p>(up close like this without balls flying every which way or one of them sniping at the other Shouyou realizes that Kageyama is actually really attractive when he\u2019s not frowning.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Kageyama says after a moment longer of the absent rattle of the soccer club across the field packing up. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Shouyou snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re also kind of smart sometimes,\u201d Kageyama adds grudgingly after a moment and it feels a little like something up near his spine must have toppled over like hastily spilled water because the shock of <em>Kageyama</em> of all people complimenting him drips something cool under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says blankly and is suddenly very glad it\u2019s dark out because he\u2019s pretty sure he's blushing right now. \u201cUm. Thanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d Kageyama snaps, suddenly back to anger so quick he\u2019s going to give Shouyou whiplash or something. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a compliment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Shouyou asks doubtfully. \u201cBecause it kind of sounded like \u2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo get the ball,\u201d Kageyama growls and his tone leaves no room for argument.</p>\n<p>Shouyou does just that \u2013 stumbling on the ground in the poor lighting and stubbing toes on roots and sticks as he scurries after the ball \u2013 not because he wants to but because part of him is still a little confused by their whole exchange just now.</p>\n<p>It felt like \u2013 if even for a moment \u2013 that they had a connection.</p>\n<p>Shouyou doesn\u2019t want to wreck whatever little progress they just made by opening his mouth.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>After the three-on-three match something seems to change between them \u2013 him and Kageyama \u2013 and Shouyou doesn\u2019t know exactly <em>why </em>or <em>when </em>or even quite <em>how</em> but he winds up looking forward to seeing Kageyama\u2019s face when he barrels into practice each day.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two seem to get along quite well these days,\u201d Sugawara observes one afternoon not long after their first practice match as the pair of them squeak the floor clean. \u201cIt\u2019s nice not to see you bickering all the time. For a while there Daichi and I thought you might never stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Shouyou blurts, even though he really clearly does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to hate somebody whose tosses make you feel like you\u2019re walking on air. It\u2019s hard to hate somebody who might not know how to say \u2018well done\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re getting better\u2019 but somehow manages to pull Shouyou out from depression when he misses a serve.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to hate Kageyama and these days Shouyou\u2019s wondering if he ever did.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get all worked up about it,\u201d Sugawara laughs, pausing in his mopping to scrub his hand affectionately through Shouyou\u2019s hair. \u201cThe two of you are amazing. This team is very lucky to have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Shouyou\u2019s chest tightens a bit at that, but it\u2019s a snug kind of tightening, not unpleasant or painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have you too,\u201d he says a bit awkwardly but completely earnest and Sugawara blinks at him in surprise. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been part of a team before, but with you and the others it really feels like one, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sugawara stares at his hopelessly sincere look for a moment before softening his expression into a smile but before he can reply a volleyball collides painfully with Shouyou\u2019s side and sends him stumbling back a few steps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re meant to be cleaning the gym,\u201d Kageyama snaps across the court and it\u2019s quite obviously him who had just pitched a ball into Shouyou\u2019s side like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are!\u201d He shouts back. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a tyrant!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama\u2019s expression hardens and he casts a supremely irritated glance at Sugawara for no apparent reason before stomping off to the back room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d Shouyou grouches as he rubs at his pained side.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Sugawara smiles and he looks entirely amused for no good reason. \u201cThat might be my fault. I think I made him a little worried there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorried?\u201d Shouyou repeats blankly. \u201cWhat has he got to be worried about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sugawara smiles enigmatically at him for a moment but doesn\u2019t answer, just shuffles away to leave Shouyou alone with his mop and his bemusement.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>(\u201cAs long as you\u2019re with me, I\u2019ll make you invincible!\u201d Kageyama shouts at him and Shouyou feels something click in place somewhere deep inside he\u2019d never realized was missing.</p>\n<p>No matter the teasing they cop from the neighborhood team, or the way Tsukishima occasionally brings it up like trying to rub dirt into an open wound, it never stops Shouyou from seeing the words as something special.</p>\n<p>It never stops them from flying him high.)</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The thing about Marks is that Shouyou had been ignoring his for so long that he\u2019d almost forgotten they were a part of everyday life.</p>\n<p>This more than anything is why he\u2019s extremely alarmed when he walks into class one day only to be ambushed by what feels like half the girls in his year, grabbing at his sleeve and tugging him into their conversation like this was an everyday thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shouyou asks in alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Somebody giggles \u2013 Shouyou thinks her name is Nakamura, although he\u2019s not sure. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about Marks, of course,\u201d she exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Shouyou says, baffled, not really sure why this should involve him of all people.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were wondering where yours is? What does it say?\u201d Somebody else pushes and a panicked glance around the classroom tells Shouyou that he\u2019s probably not the first one to be assaulted today. Half the boys in the room are looking at him sympathetically and nodding in what\u2019s probably meant to be an encouraging manner.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Shouyou says as somebody tugs his sleeve again to drag his attention back to the conversation. He feels way out of his depths here. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d probably-Nakamura laughs and when she tilts her head Shouyou can see a string of Kanji where her neck joins her shoulder, much in the same place as his own mother wears his father\u2019s name. For a moment he\u2019s almost a little envious. He wonders what it might be like to have a perfectly ordinary Mark so that you didn\u2019t feel out of place in a room of uncovered names.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s not that interesting,\u201d he lies, and his fingers creep to make sure his shirt collar is dragged closed enough that they can\u2019t catch the sprawl of colors in their little impossible shape. He almost wishes he was still in the same habit of hiding it beneath plasters and bandages that he had when he was younger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to show us can you at least tell us what it says?\u201d Another girl begs and Shouyou wonders a bit at this sudden Mark fever.</p>\n<p>A Mark is a reasonably private thing \u2013 or so Shouyou has always thought \u2013 and he can\u2019t fathom why anybody should be all that interested in somebody else\u2019s. He\u2019s never felt the urge to peep on any of his teammates while they change, had never asked or felt obliged to answer when it came up in casual conversation.</p>\n<p>He supposes this might be a high school thing. The idea of true love \u2013 of Soulmates \u2013 is a very appealing prospect to discover while you\u2019re still young.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he stutters and everybody\u2019s attention is so rapt on him that he feels unbelievably nervous. There\u2019s no reason to lie, exactly, but Shouyou\u2019s still vastly uncomfortable with everything going on right then and there. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol,\u201d he says and he doesn\u2019t tell them what it is if only because he doesn\u2019t want people to start speculating. \u201cAnd, uh, I\u2019m not exactly sure what it\u2019s meant to say. I\u2019ve never had it translated.\u201d</p>\n<p>A chorus of squeals makes him a bit unsteady on his feet and suddenly he\u2019s got a dozen girls talking at him at once \u2013 touching him.</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s never been uncomfortable with physical contact \u2013 he\u2019s always been a very touchy person \u2013 but being swamped like this by people he can barely claim to know makes him desperately uneasy and when fingers stray too close to his Mark he physically jerks back.</p>\n<p>As it is Shouyou is saved from the situation when the door rattles open to admit a very confused looking teacher but even when he returns to his seat Shouyou can\u2019t quite manage to drag his mind away from it all.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the day it\u2019s all he can think about.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, do you think it\u2019s weird that people are so open about their Marks?\u201d Shouyou blurts out after practice one day while they\u2019re changing in the clubroom. He\u2019s not exactly sure what possesses him to ask because it\u2019s not like this is the kind of stuff they discuss when whamming volleyballs around a court, but it\u2019s been stuck in his head since the whole incident in the classroom the other day.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Tanaka asks as he shrugs into his jacket. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Shouyou says, self-conscious now that the whole fucking team is looking at him like this. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I always thought they should be kind of private, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tanaka looks at him for a moment like he\u2019s grown a second head and Shouyou\u2019s not really surprised. Out of all of them Tanaka\u2019s probably the most open about the whole business. His own Mark is a curve of English lettering in a soft blue beneath the jut of his ear, and, if anything, he\u2019s always seemed more than happy to show it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Daichi who \u2013 with a look of some concern \u2013 asks: \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Shouyou hesitates because in the strictest sense he supposes something did. \u201cIt\u2019s just, everybody seems to be getting really intense about this stuff lately and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you an idiot or a high schooler?\u201d Tsukishima asks him sneeringly as he jams his jersey back into his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite typical for it to become the focus of everyone\u2019s attention when they\u2019re in high school,\u201d Asahi says, and it\u2019s probably only the fact that he has about fifteen pounds on Tsukishima that keeps him from arguing back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but won\u2019t it just happen when it happens?\u201d Shouyou can\u2019t help himself asking. Even he can\u2019t explain why he feels this frustrated about the topic. \u201cIsn\u2019t it worse to try and rush things?\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like the whole club is eyeing him now and there\u2019s a look on Kageyama\u2019s face that he really can\u2019t place. Shouyou feels foolish \u2013 feels like he\u2019s just making himself out to be a little kid \u2013 but he also feels restless and annoyed and a bit like he\u2019s going to cry for no good reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he says into the awkward silence and finishes yanking his shoes on in a hurry as he stumbles his way over to the door. \u201cI\u2019m going ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Someone calls out behind him but Shouyou\u2019s already stumbling his way down the clubroom steps and rushing for the bike rack.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like he\u2019d expected anybody to understand what he meant when he barely understood himself.</p>\n<p>By the time he reaches his bike he\u2019s worked himself up into such a state that he can barely remember the combination of his lock, let alone twist it in when his fingers are shaking so badly that his nails clatter against the hefty metal and plastic of the lock piping.</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s just really irritated and he can\u2019t figure out why. He hasn\u2019t stopped to think about Marks and Soulmates since he was a child. He\u2019d almost forgotten they existed. His Mark was just that little funny thing on his collarbone that he didn\u2019t like other people looking at and Soulmates was just a word that explained why his parents never got tired of one another.</p>\n<p>His bike lock jingles in his hands and it takes everything he has to keep himself from ripping it free.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Somebody snaps and warm hands close over his shaking fingers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Kageyama \u2013 of course it\u2019s Kageyama \u2013 and he looks concerned in an irritated kind of way, which was basically the only kind of concern he was capable of showing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shouyou snaps and even he\u2019s surprised by his rudeness.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean <em>what</em>?\u201d Kageyama growls and the grip on his fingers tightened. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you today? First all that shit about Marks and then you jump down everybody\u2019s throat when they try and answer you? Also, you were rubbish on the court today. You missed nearly every toss I sent your way. That\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t, not at all, but Shouyou isn\u2019t going to admit that to Kageyama of all people.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he grunts. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m feeling well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look of concern on Kageyama\u2019s face deepens and without so much as a word he releases Shouyou\u2019s hands only to \u2013 <em>oh my god</em> \u2013 lean forward and press the back of his palm against his forehead.</p>\n<p>He was leaning in so close that Shouyou can see the pale slide of his skin and how his eyes are almost blue in this light; sharp and focused and beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do feel kind of hot,\u201d Kageyama allows and it takes everything Shouyou has to keep from blurting <em>no, </em>you\u2019re<em> kind of hot</em>.</p>\n<p>Something is seriously wrong with him. He feels sick to his stomach.</p>\n<p>Kageyama pulls back and frowns at him, completely oblivious to the way Shouyou probably stopped breathing the second he leaned in. \u201cAre you okay? You\u2019re really red.\u201d</p>\n<p>No, he isn\u2019t fucking okay because all he can think about is how attractive Kageyama is right now and how much he loves it when he tosses him the ball and how every time they were in the same room together something inside Shouyou feels like they just weren\u2019t close enough and \u2013</p>\n<p>Shouyou feels sick to his stomach.</p>\n<p>He likes Kageyama Tobio\u2019s face and his passes and the way he would sometimes smother a smile if Shouyou managed a spectacular spike when he was in just the right mood. He likes the fact that Kageyama Tobio is a genius on the court but somehow still manages to turn his homework in late like everybody else and how excited he gets when they win a set against a particular strong opponent, how he sometimes shouts for pork buns when the seniors are short on cash and how even though he never says anything he always gives Shouyou first pick.</p>\n<p>More than any of that though he just likes Kageyama Tobio.</p>\n<p>He just <em>really</em> fucking likes Kageyama Tobio.</p>\n<p>The Mark on his skin feels heavy and thick. Like it was weighed down by real gold instead of glitter-bright lines of color.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Shouyou says and he\u2019d already started backing away by the time the words are halfway out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018go\u2019?\u201d Kageyama blinks at him, looking so confused he can\u2019t even manage anger. \u201cYour bike is \u2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it tomorrow,\u201d Shouyou blurts. \u201cI\u2019ve just \u2013 I gotta \u2013 tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and flees after that and he thinks he hears Kageyama calling out after him as he runs but if he does the words are lost to the sharp hiss of the wind around him and the thumping of blood in his ears.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s more than a little head over heels for Kageyama Tobio and he\u2019s not quite sure why he\u2019s only noticing this now.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Shouyou doesn\u2019t go to school the next day. Instead he gets his mother to call him in sick before she takes the family out to visit a relative and then makes an appointment with a specialist in Soul Marks for the early morning. It\u2019s perhaps one of the most nerve wracking phone calls he\u2019s ever made.</p>\n<p>(\u201cHello, my name is Hinata Shouyou and I was wondering if you can translate the inscription on my Mark for me? Yes, yes. No. I, um \u2013 No, I\u2019ve never \u2013 yes, I know it\u2019s late \u2013 ten you said? No, I mean yes. Yes that\u2019s fine for me. Okay, thank you, see you then.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Shouyou sorely regrets leaving his bike behind in his mad dash from the school the previous day \u2013 the hike is long and swelteringly hot \u2013 but not enough to actually go back and retrieve it once he actually makes it to town. He\u2019d rather walk all the way back than risk bumping into anybody he knows at school.</p>\n<p>The place he goes for his appointment is small and nondescript and the door opens on the first knock and Shouyou is ushered inside by a kindly old lady who fusses about him something awful.</p>\n<p>The appointment itself takes no more than twenty minutes but when Shouyou emerges from the building it feels like it should have been an eternity.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even remember how he gets home after that but he does and he spends all day lying in bed staring at walls like if he can just ignore the world long enough it\u2019ll just go away.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s being really stupid \u2013 even he knows that \u2013 but it\u2019s easier to convince himself he\u2019s sick than to admit that he\u2019d been a little in love with Kageyama for a long while now. He wonders if his obsession with him had just turned into something else without him realizing it or if there had been a spark there from the beginning.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know. He really, really doesn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>His phone goes off pretty much non-stop for the whole day. He should probably turn it off, he thinks, but there\u2019s something nice about hearing it rattle uselessly against his desk. On one hand he\u2019s not brave enough to face his teammates \u2013 to face his friends \u2013 but on the other at least this way he knows they\u2019re thinking of him.</p>\n<p>(he\u2019d never realized just how much of a coward he was before.)</p>\n<p>He needs to get up. He needs to talk to Kageyama. He needs to stop being afraid of everything.</p>\n<p>Shouyou doesn\u2019t know how long he stays curled up in bed, but evidently it\u2019s long enough to fall asleep because at some point he\u2019s woken up by a loud banging on his front door like someone is trying to mine it for gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cMom!\u201d He calls out after a moment of muddled blinking only to remember that his parents and his sister had gone to visit his aunt for the night and weren\u2019t going to be back until tomorrow morning sometime.</p>\n<p>Blinking blearily Shouyou stumbles out of bed and drags himself to the door \u2013 somewhat irritated at the interruption to his pity party \u2013 and hopes whoever it is isn\u2019t going to be mortified when he answers it looking like he\u2019d just climbed out of his own grave.</p>\n<p>The knocking gets louder and louder as Shouyou makes his way down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he sighs and shoves the door open.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Kageyama.</p>\n<p>Of course it\u2019s Kageyama.</p>\n<p><em>Oh crap</em>, Shouyou thinks as he takes in Kageyama\u2019s pissed expression and the way he\u2019s gritting his teeth, and it\u2019s nothing short of complete stupidity that he goes to slam the door shut in his face but Shouyou\u2019s just woken up and Kageyama has the well-honed reflexes of a volleyball player so it\u2019s no surprise that he manages to slam it open again before it even fully closes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to shut me out,\u201d he hisses angrily as he shoulders his way forcibly into the house and Shouyou just knows he\u2019s in for a whole world of hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m \u2013 um \u2013 really sick. You\u2019ll catch it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Kageyama says bluntly as he closes the door behind him loud enough to make the doorframe shudder. \u201cYou\u2019re avoiding me like a piece of shit. You\u2019re not sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s heart is beating up a storm. He can barely breathe. He can\u2019t get the kindly old woman who translated his Mark out of his head, the light pattering of her fingers against his skin and the sigh of her voice as she\u2019d said <em>you could say it means \u2013 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Shouyou says and shoots for a new tactic. \u201cOkay, yes. I\u2019m avoiding you. So will you please go now? <em>Please</em>?\u201d His voice cracks embarrassingly loud on that final plea and he backs up into a wall and buries his face in his hands in mortification.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how to deal with this. His whole life has just been a whole lot of avoiding things that weren\u2019t volleyball. What do people <em>do </em>with this real life stuff that swoops in so unpleasantly whenever it wants like an uninvited guest?</p>\n<p>Like Kageyama Tobio who had just invited himself into his home like it wasn\u2019t enough already that he\u2019d invited himself into Shouyou\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kageyama says, and his voice is several degrees higher in alarm. Shouyou feels him shuffle in closer and wrap slender fingers around his wrists as he tries to drag Shouyou\u2019s hands away from his face. \u201cWould you just tell me what\u2019s going on? I can\u2019t fix it if I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix this,\u201d Shouyou says into his palms and his voice is muffled horrendously but he thinks Kageyama gets the drift because he stops trying to force Shouyou\u2019s hands away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a moment but for their respective heavy breathing and then Kageyama\u2019s fingers tighten so much they\u2019re almost painful on his skin. \u201cWas it \u2013 am I\u2026\u201d he makes a noise that sounds both pained and frustrated at the same time. \u201cHave I been a bad teammate? Is that why you won\u2019t receive my tosses anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something clicks and Shouyou realizes with absolute horror what Kageyama is trying to tell him and he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s been <em>this </em>dense.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing for his inability to deal with his feelings for Kageyama to affect him \u2013 but to have them hit so close to home for Kageyama like that is another.</p>\n<p>Shouyou doesn\u2019t think Kageyama has ever really recovered from having his team walk off the court on him; for being benched just for being himself. When Kageyama asks if he\u2019s been a bad teammate he\u2019s really asking \u2018<em>have you had enough of me now?</em>\u2019</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cNo!\u201d Shouyou snaps viciously as he finally forces himself to look up into Kageyama\u2019s startled eyes because he <em>cannot </em>have him misunderstand something this serious. \u201cNo! It\u2019s nothing like that, okay? This hasn\u2019t got anything to do with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama just looks really surprised for a moment and then really relieved \u2013 cycling through emotions like they were hats in need of being dropped \u2013 before he finally settles back on exasperation as he looks down at Shouyou from their considerable height difference, fingers still solidly around his wrists like he intends to wrench his hands off if Shouyou shows any indication of trying to hide again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if this isn\u2019t about that,\u201d Kageyama says, \u201cwhat is it about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou feels like throwing up all over again \u2013 nerves tend to manifest that way in him \u2013 but he probably can\u2019t just go on as he is now. Pretending nothing\u2019s wrong hadn\u2019t worked and there was no way he was ever going to be able to be alone with Kageyama without wanting to kiss him <em>so</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I need to show you something.\u201d The words are harder than he\u2019d like to admit to get out.</p>\n<p>Kageyama blinks at him and then narrows his eyes suspiciously. \u201cAnd you promise you\u2019re not going to bolt if I let you go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou tries for a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s my house,\u201d he reminds him. \u201cWhere would I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama hesitates for a moment longer, but whether it\u2019s Shouyou\u2019s words or his dead serious expression he eventually steps back, reluctantly releasing his wrists like he\u2019s still a little afraid Shouyou might make a dash for the next prefecture over without a leash on him.</p>\n<p><em>You can do this</em>, Shouyou encourages himself as he takes in several deep breathes and turns to head back to his room.</p>\n<p>After a moment Kageyama follows him.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Shouyou comes from a family with a full set of parents and a sister. He\u2019s not really used to having the house to himself like this, let alone at this time of the evening.</p>\n<p>It makes him bizarrely nervous as he rattles open his bedroom door and gestures for Kageyama to follow him in. \u201cYou can have a seat on the bed,\u201d he suggest a little awkwardly, because there\u2019s nowhere really else for it.</p>\n<p>Kageyama doesn\u2019t seem half as nervous as Shouyou is, he just shrugs his bag to the floor and sits himself down on the edge of the mattress like they did this every day.</p>\n<p>Possibly Shouyou is the only one working himself up in knots over this.</p>\n<p>He closes the door for no real reason other than habit. The same reason he asked Kageyama to his room instead of just having this conversation out in the hallway. They\u2019re alone in the house. It\u2019s not like anybody is going to overhear them or burst in at an awkward moment, but Shouyou is nervous enough.</p>\n<p>He needs some sort of familiarity here.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Kageyama asks as Shouyou hovers by the door. \u201cYou going to tell me what\u2019s going on or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou takes in a deep breath and shuts his eyes for a moment as he steels himself before straightening his back and turning around, walking with small, uneven steps so he can plop down besides Kageyama on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Do you remember how I was talking about Marks the other day?\u201d He says and it\u2019s probably just his imagination but it feels like Kageyama stiffens beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he says slowly.</p>\n<p>Shouyou coaches himself through another handful of breaths, his fingers rolling and unrolling in the hem of his rumpled button-up. \u201cHave you ever seen mine, Kageyama?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama definitely starts at that. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he almost snaps. \u201cWhy would I \u2013 that would be beyond rude to snoop on someone\u2019s Mark like that without asking.\u201d He\u2019s flustered. More than flustered.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s beyond endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Shouyou says. \u201cYeah, I thought as much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then \u2013 without so much as a word \u2013 he reaches up and starts unbuttoning his shirt.</p>\n<p>If Kageyama had been red before it was nothing compared to now. He jerks back like Shouyou had just slapped him, putting space between them in an instance. \u201cWhat are you <em>doing</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou ignores him, focusing on the steady <em>click-click-click </em>of buttons sliding beneath his fingertips until his shirt was half-undone and just hanging on his shoulders; the Mark on his collarbone plain as day as he hovered uncertain fingers over it and slowly turned to face Kageyama.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he demands and Kageyama just stares at him blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Shouyou says, trying to sound confident instead of shaky, making impatient grabbing motions with his own hand. \u201cTrust me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Trust me like I trust you. A hundred percent and without a doubt</em>.</p>\n<p>And after a moment Kageyama does; slowly edging closer and holding out his hand so that Shouyou can take his wrist and guide it so that his fingers are hovering over his own that he was pressing so tightly over his Mark.</p>\n<p>He takes in a deep breath and moves his hand so that Kageyama\u2019s fingers hover an inch away from his naked, exposed Mark.</p>\n<p>The breath Kageyama takes in is like breathing static electricity. Shouyou can almost feel it from where he\u2019s sitting, sweating in the summer heat but shaking with the way Kageyama is staring unabashedly at his Mark like somebody had just kicked him in the gut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2013 is that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s Mark was a crown; obvious in the beautifully gilded edges that swirled around on his skin like somebody had finger painted along his collar with nails smudged in gold and red. It was beautiful \u2013 even Shouyou knew as much \u2013 and there was absolutely only one person in the world it could belong to.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d Kageyama doesn\u2019t seem capable of getting a full sentence out \u2013 he looks almost as shaken as Shouyou feels \u2013 but he understands him all the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says awkwardly. \u201cI mean yes. Yes, you can touch it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly \u2013 reverently \u2013 Kageyama lowers his hand until his fingertips graze along the skin.</p>\n<p>Shouyou bites down on his lips to stop what might have been a very embarrassing gasp. It\u2019s hard to explain exactly what it felt like in that moment when Kageyama touched him skin-on-skin for the first time; his finger tracing gently along his Mark.</p>\n<p>It was a little like the feeling Shouyou got when he spiked a ball perfectly; exhilarating and endless and <em>electric</em>.</p>\n<p>Kageyama moves in closer, shuffling so that they were pressed right up against each other with one of his hands pressed into the soft mattress on the opposite side of Shouyou\u2019s thigh and his face close as he stared intently at the Mark as he traced it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe inscription,\u201d he breathes into the silence and Shouyou feels his finger glide along the beautiful, forgotten lettering. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou closes his eyes against the way it was suddenly very hard to find breath. \u201cIt means \u2018<em>to command a royal aura, especially amongst the presence of fellow nobility</em><em>\u2019.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Kageyama\u2019s fingers freeze. \u201cSo it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Shouyou smiles, strained and nervous but not unhappy. \u201cThe direct translation works out to be \u2018<em>King of the Court</em><em>\u2019</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama\u2019s fingers unfurl against his skin so that\u2019s he\u2019s pressing the palm of his hand against Shouyou\u2019s Mark \u2013 skin on skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cKageyama \u2013.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever Shouyou is about to say is cut off when Kageyama <em>shoves </em>him, sending him sprawling back on the bed so that Kageyama settles over him like an impenetrable wall, massive and looming.</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s words die in his throat and his eyes widen as Kageyama leans back on his heels a little and reaches down to curl his fingers around the hem of his own shirt as he lifts it.</p>\n<p>Shouyou makes a noise that is half a word \u2013 Kageyama\u2019s name, he thinks \u2013 and half just a sound of petrified surprise. It sticks on his lips and comes out garbled as he watched the way Kageyama tilts his head to the side and flexes his shoulders as the shirt comes over his head.</p>\n<p>Shouyou knows he must have seen Kageyama do this at some point \u2013 they get changed in the same locker room after all \u2013 but between the heat in the room making him drip sweat and the naked skin above him it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s.</p>\n<p><em>Erotic</em>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not really another word for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop freaking out for a moment,\u201d Kageyama says and the words are familiar even if the shake in his voice is not. He shifts, leaning down to take Shouyou\u2019s hand in his own and guiding it up like Shouyou had done to Kageyama himself. \u201cJust\u2026 look.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that he settles Shouyou\u2019s fingers over something dark and shaded on his chest where it lives just above his heart and Shouyou realizes, as his fingers brush the cool, shimmering lines that this is Kageyama\u2019s <em>Mark</em>.</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s mouth goes dry. \u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kageyama says, a little awkward and more than a little nervous.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a deep beautiful blue \u2013 a very rich and noble color that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in throne rooms \u2013 and Shouyou\u2019s fingers tremble as they trace along countless, countless little hooks in the lines, the intricate sprays of shiny blue that could almost be trembling beneath his touch.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a crow; wings spread like it\u2019s midflight. Each one of the splayed feathers is an individual little curve and although the Mark is as small as all other Marks are, the spread of the wings makes it seem endless and inevitable.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a scratch of writing \u2013 beautiful letters like the ones Shouyou wears \u2013 resting right beneath the tucked up talons.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it \u2013 do you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>One of Kageyama\u2019s hands comes up to rest on Shouyou\u2019s, spreading his fingers so that they\u2019re intertwined in a fist against his skin. Shouyou can feel the rapid <em>thump-thump-thump</em> of his heart beneath his palm and it occurs to him to wonder just how much of that is nerves and just how much might be arousal at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kageyama says again, and he\u2019s looking right at Shouyou now. \u201cIt means \u2018<em>to be made invincible</em>\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou\u2019s heart freezes for a moment and when it starts beating again it feels like a splash of hot water in his veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he mutters and he lifts one of his arms to bury his face in the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Kageyama says as he settles above Shouyou and reaches down with his free hand to gently pull Shouyou\u2019s arm from his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop hiding like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seeing Kageyama leaning above him with their hands joined over his Mark is nearly too much for Shouyou to take. This is his <em>Soulmate </em>\u2013 Kageyama is Marked for <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d Shouyou asks and Kageyama shifts uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>\u201cA while,\u201d he admits. \u201cI started thinking about it the very first time I tossed for you, but I think I really realized after the match with Asahi and Nishinoya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouyou feels like he can almost taste the rapid fan of his pulse. It tastes a lot like sweat and blood. \u201cThat long?\u201d he hisses. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama sighs and pulls back a little, letting their entwined hands unfold so he can scrub a hand through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure and <em>you </em>hadn\u2019t said anything. I didn\u2019t want to spook you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have spooked me,\u201d Shouyou says immediately and Kageyama\u2019s frown softens a little into something that wasn\u2019t quite a smile but <em>almost</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I know that now, dumbass,\u201d he mutters and cuffs Shouyou lightly on his forehead, only his hand lingers, fingers opening to cup Shouyou\u2019s cheek. He looks undeniably fond and it\u2019s not an expression Shouyou is used to being aimed his way but he thinks he could adjust to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispers as he reaches up so that he can tangle his hands in Kageyama\u2019s hair, drawing him in closer and trying hard to focus on the way Kageyama\u2019s breathing grows more rapid the closer he gets, the light sheen of sweat on his naked skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kageyama says and it\u2019s almost a rasp.</p>\n<p>Shouyou takes a deep breath and lowers his face into the crook of Kageyama\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody\u2019s going to be home tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kageyama freezes for a moment and Shouyou thinks he might have said something wrong.</p>\n<p>And then he pulls back, looks him in the eye and kisses him.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Kageyama\u2019s lips taste like sweat and spice.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both clumsy and inexperienced, but it just makes the way Shouyou\u2019s heart is filled to bursting even sweeter. He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019d feel if Kageyama kissed like he had any real experience, and the awkward slide of his hands and the way he can\u2019t seem to undo the last few buttons on Shouyou\u2019s shirt is so adorable he almost laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says and gently nudges aside Kageyama\u2019s fingers so that he can undo them himself, but it\u2019s Kageyama he allows to shuffle the shirt off his shoulders to drop unwanted to the floor.</p>\n<p>When Kageyama gets a hand down his shorts Shouyou gasps and clutches at Kageyama\u2019s shoulders for an anchor. When Kageyama leans forward to press his lips against the golden crown on his collarbone he nearly sobs, and the noises Kageyama makes when Shouyou manages to get a hand between them to touch him too nearly sends him over the edge.</p>\n<p>He comes with the feeling of being loved and wanted and <em>needed</em>.</p>\n<p>He feels <em>invincible</em>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Afterwards they huddle together beneath the blankets on Shouyou\u2019s bed. It\u2019s too hot for this \u2013 really \u2013 but there\u2019s something about being piled together in a tangle of naked limbs and jutting elbows that appeals to them.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been enough confusion and heartache and hopeless yearning to last a decade. Right now Shouyou thinks they need this, to lie together with wayward fingers tracing lines in the dark with sweat trickling down the small of their backs and hair sticking uncomfortably to damp skin.</p>\n<p>They talk about things. Little, inconsequential, and with halting sentences like they\u2019re still a little scared to jump into this with all they have.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not their nature to take things slow, but they\u2019re still young and restless and Shouyou never thought he\u2019d ever find his Soulmate hidden away in a gym wearing a crown on his head to match the one on his collar, but he thinks he\u2019s glad he did.</p>\n<p>Their relationship has been strange from the beginning and Shouyou wonders why he didn\u2019t notice this then. Daichi once told him it was unnatural to trust someone the way he trusted Kageyama; to leap with his eyes closed and have faith that Kageyama wouldn\u2019t let him fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he mutters against Kageyama\u2019s shoulder and the way he shifts sleepily around him makes him think that he might have been asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Shouyou says and he means it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kageyama groans. \u201cI love you, too. Now go to sleep dumbass before I make you.\u201d</p>"
