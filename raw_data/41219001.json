  "text": "<p>In some recent years, Hob Gadling\u2014currently Robert Goldman\u2014has felt a bit too old to do much more than wait.</p>\n<p>Hob has become quite good at waiting. Patience is a virtue, truly; something he had to learn early in his freshly immortal life, no matter how bitter he\u2019d been about it at times. Sometimes, waiting is leaning back and watching an investment unfold piece by slow piece\u2014sometimes, it\u2019s keeping his mouth shut as the others around him chatter and squawk with gossip and news\u2014sometimes, it\u2019s sitting alone in a pub, nursing a pint of whatever passes for alcohol nowadays, watching the traffic flowing in and out of the door for a familiar face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for someone,\u201d he tells the waitress when she goes to make away with the empty chair, trying for a smile and knowing he fails, if the odd look she slips toward him from the corner of her eye is any indication. She still smiles back and nods in understanding, but scurries away immediately after. He must make for a sorry sight, he thinks distantly.</p>\n<p>Hob wonders if his desperation is coming off him in waves, even if he doesn\u2019t want to admit it to himself. He <em>does\u2014</em>admit it, that is\u2014but he doesn\u2019t <em>want </em>to. Who ever does? Who <em>wants</em> to admit to the crushing loneliness that attaches itself to waiting when it\u2019s waiting <em>for someone? </em>For someone who Hob cannot even convince himself will come.</p>\n<p>The first time, of course, there was uncertainty. Fear that Hob had\u2026 gone mad, or something. Actually died, and this was some sick form of Hell, where he\u2019d be given everything he wanted and then have it all stripped away. Or maybe that it was real, but it would be taken away regardless.</p>\n<p>But after that first time\u2014after that <em>fascination </em>from his Stranger\u2014Hob hadn\u2019t been uncertain again. Not until now.</p>\n<p>Hob isn\u2019t sure when he started thinking of the not-man as <em>his </em>Stranger\u2014maybe somewhere around 1889, Hob thinks only a little bitterly\u2014but it fits.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still so much he doesn\u2019t know. Hob tilts his glass in circles, watching the drink inside swirl lazily. He doesn\u2019t know exactly why, or how, he\u2019s immortal. After all this time, the most he\u2019s managed to gather is that his Stranger was interested, for some reason, in how a human would act if they escaped Death. A <em>human, </em>because Hob\u2019s Stranger certainly wasn\u2019t human, and Hob started wondering some odd centuries ago if the strange man had ever even been anything close to it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so\u2026 odd, Hob\u2019s Stranger. Nothing but skin and bones, but it looks <em>graceful </em>on him, somehow. On anyone else, on anyone <em>human,</em> it would do nothing more than make him look wiry, like a particularly flighty cat or an especially haughty crow. Although those are still good descriptors, Hob thinks with amusement as he sips his beer.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a power to him that Hob\u2019s never been able to put words to, like the frozen moment when adrenaline kicks in and the world becomes clearer, everything sharper in the heavy breathing of danger. It had been the first thing Hob had noticed, all those centuries ago, when he\u2019d been called on his half-drunken brag that he would never die. Hob still remembers those eyes, the way they\u2019d gleamed from the inside in the firelight of the inn, the way they\u2019d watched him for centuries after, waiting. Always, always waiting.</p>\n<p>Hob spares a thought to wonder what his Stranger is always waiting for, but dismisses it immediately afterwards. What some endless being, some creature more powerful and incomprehensible than Hob will probably ever know, has to wait for, Hob is sure it\u2019s not something he wants any part in.</p>\n<p>The crowd around him is starting to thin. When Hob glances out the window, the sun is creeping closer to its bed in the horizon, weighing heavy down in the sky. Has he always waited this long, he wonders? When was the last time his Stranger waited until sundown or after to alight himself in the chair across the table?</p>\n<p>Hob glances at the empty chair, positioned next to his for the very first time, and pointedly does not think about how obvious that probably is.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou dare,\u201d </em>his Stranger\u2019s voice lingers in the back of his mind, like a ghost\u2019s whisper.</p>\n<p>Hob tosses back the last drink of his beer and stands, reaching for his wallet to toss a bill or two on the table. The door opens.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobert Goldman!\u201d says a woman\u2019s bright voice, full of energy and a welcome unfamiliar to Hob, and Hob freezes, eyes lifting from his wallet.</p>\n<p>Stood across the table from him, so silent that Hob hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d strode up, is a young woman with a dazzling smile. She\u2019s in a neat leather jacket and sturdy jeans, the kind bikers wear when they know they could fuck someone up if they needed to. There\u2019s a golden ankh around her neck, and a strange taste settles in Hob\u2019s mouth when his gaze lands on it, like it\u2019s staring right through him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Hob says smartly, forcing his eyes back up to the woman\u2019s face. The grin she flashes him is blinding. Her hands are shoved into the pockets of her jacket, and Hob briefly wonders if he\u2019s about to get robbed in the middle of the inn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, have we met?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s very sure they haven\u2019t; he would remember how bitter his mouth tastes as he runs his tongue over his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have,\u201d the woman says. Her grin has settled into just a pleasant smile, and she takes her hands out of her pockets to gesture down at the table. Hob sits without thinking about it and watches her drag the other chair around to sit opposite him, folding her hands on the table politely. \u201cOnly the once, though, and you didn\u2019t know it at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob squints at her. The woman huffs a soft breath out of her nose that Hob only recognizes as a laugh because his Stranger does the same thing.</p>\n<p>Hob bristles.</p>\n<p>As much as he likes to lean in to being an airhead, Hob isn\u2019t <em>stupid. </em>He\u2019s not slow on the uptake. Oh, it\u2019s easy to let people think he is, especially when he needs something out of them, but six hundred years of life teaches a man how to be intelligent and observant, even if he didn\u2019t start out that way. And the wrong taste in Hob\u2019s mouth, and the knowingness in the woman\u2019s smile, and the way her eyes shine just too far to the left of the inn\u2019s lighting, well\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, uh.\u201d Hob closes his wallet and puts it back in his coat pocket with one hand, using the other to gesture vaguely toward his new tablemate. \u201cYou\u2026 Y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman raises one eyebrow, her smile blazing with amusement. \u201cDo I know?\u201d she asks, in a voice that says she damn well does.</p>\n<p>If her huff didn\u2019t confirm it for Hob, so similar to his Stranger, well; her apparent fondness for making fun of him does the trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Hob slumps back in his chair, folding his hands over his stomach. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something in the woman\u2019s gaze\u2014an oldness, a knowledge, a patience, that Hob has only ever seen in the mirror and across a pub table. It\u2019s a little funny, now that Hob is thinking about it; he never would have thought of his Stranger as patient, before. Willing to wait, yes, but not exactly <em>patient. </em>Briefly, Hob wonders if patience comes with being human, but then he thinks the woman sat across from him carries an air with her far too great to have ever been human.</p>\n<p>The woman watches him, hands folded on the table, something almost like curiosity written quietly in her expression. It\u2019s so similar to his Stranger that it throws Hob for a loop, just for a second, but then her smile turns sad and Hob\u2019s blood turns cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asks, not unkindly.</p>\n<p>Hob swallows thickly. He feels too vulnerable, suddenly, leaning back in his chair, so he sits forward and grabs at his empty glass, poking at the handle idly. The change in position doesn\u2019t help\u2014it feels like this woman and her necklace are looking straight past him and into his very soul, laying him bare right here in the middle of the inn. \u201cYeah,\u201d he croaks, then clears his throat, tapping his nails on the side of his glass. \u201cI, uh\u2014yeah. You-You know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d the woman confirms, not that it\u2019d been much of a question, then hits Hob with, \u201cHe\u2019s my bullheaded little brother,\u201d like it\u2019s the most casual thing in the world.</p>\n<p>Hob chokes on his own spit, a cough and a wheeze and a hand up to cover his mouth, eyes bugging out over his palm. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see the waitress from earlier shooting him and his new guest a startled look. Hob feels for her, in that moment. The woman\u2014his Stranger\u2019s older sister, Christ above, what a thought\u2014only watches him with wry amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Hob wheezes, moving his hand from his mouth to run his fingers through his hair, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014alright. Yeah, alright, Christ. Dunno why I thought this couldn\u2019t get any fucking weirder. No, y\u2019know, no offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d the woman hums. She looks pleased with herself in a smug sort of way, like there\u2019s a point she\u2019s all the more closer to proving to someone. Like a cat waiting for the mouse to come out of its hole, Hob thinks. This family is awfully akin to cats.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other for a moment, Hob trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and the woman, seemingly, reveling in his confusion, before her smile fades. Hob has only known her a few minutes, and yet seeing her without a smile, even a sad one, is something that he knows to simply be <em>wrong.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know, Hob,\u201d she tells him, slow and quiet, and Hob doesn\u2019t like what she has to say even before she continues, \u201cHe won\u2019t be coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIf you\u2019re here, too, it\u2019ll be because we\u2019re friends! No other reason!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>For the very first time in his long, long life, Hob Gadling feels like his heart truly stops.</p>\n<p>Hob is familiar with loss. He has to be, living for centuries. He was even before his sudden gift of immortality; soldiering is a business wrought with loss on all sides, death and decay and despair following every man who steps foot on a battlefield. Hob has held his friends as they died, has stood at funerals far too many to count, has carried caskets of good men and women taken too early\u2014has borne the burden of the death of his only wife and son, destroying him from the inside out. And yet, still, he\u2019s gone forward, because for all the death he\u2019s witnessed, he <em>loves </em>life.</p>\n<p>But with all the loss he\u2019s seen, all the centuries of it he\u2019s carried with him, there is something so different about the ice that pieces his heart with those words. <em>He won\u2019t be coming. </em>Oh, how stupid Hob had been. The death of his own flesh and blood to compare, and yet Hob sits in this pub in 1989 and feels for the very first time that maybe he\u2019s finally died and this is his real Hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Hob,\u201d murmurs the woman, so full of pity it makes Hob feel sick. She reaches across the table and rests her hands atop his, gripping his empty glass so tightly he\u2019s distantly surprised it hasn\u2019t shattered. He can\u2019t bring himself to shake her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, ah,\u201d Hob hears himself say, his voice low and creaking, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t surprised. Had a fight, last time, y\u2019know. Just\u2014didn\u2019t think he\u2019d send his sister for him, instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a fierce bitterness, a shade of anger, in the jab, but the woman seems to know it\u2019s not for her. She squeezes Hob\u2019s fingers, tilts her head down to meet his eyes\u2014Hob hadn\u2019t realized his gaze had dropped away from hers\u2014and tells him, just as quietly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his choice.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>What, </em>says Hob\u2019s mind in the middle of its whirlwind, so abrupt and resounding that it makes everything come to a standstill. \u201cWhat,\u201d says Hob\u2019s mouth, hoarse and thin.</p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s smile returns, even sadder than before. \u201cHe\u2019s not standing you up,\u201d she says softly, \u201cHe\u2019s trapped, Hob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTr\u2014he\u2014you\u2014<em>what?\u201d </em>Hob barks, lifting his head to meet the woman\u2019s eyes again properly. His anger at the world, at his Stranger, at himself, ignites quickly and suddenly, reaching up from his chest and clogging his throat, waiting for a direction to turn itself towards. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about, <em>trapped? </em>How can a god get <em>trapped?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gods, Hob,\u201d the woman corrects gently. She strokes her fingers over Hob\u2019s, such a sisterly gesture that Hob feels his shoulders relax, just a bit. \u201cWe all have our weaknesses, still. Magic isn\u2019t as widespread as it once was, but sometimes\u2026 Sometimes, someone gets lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWho?\u201d </em>Hob demands, something like a growl in his throat. His mind is stuck on his Stranger\u2019s face, that night in 1889. On the quiet, righteous anger and the hissed words meant to hurt; on the shock at Hob\u2019s audacity; on the <em>fear </em>Hob had seen in those burning eyes, just for a moment, gone in a flash but Hob had gotten <em>good </em>at reading this strange man, so detached from humanity as he wanted to be and so much closer to it than he seemed to think.</p>\n<p><em>Trapped.</em> Hob\u2019s own eyes are burning, now, throat tight, fury burning hot in the pit of his stomach, and he wants very badly to hit someone, and maybe also shoot them, preferably somewhere lethal.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says his Stranger\u2019s sister. She sighs slowly. \u201cAt least not for certain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you <em>think, </em>then?\u201d Hob pushes. His tone is far too snappish considering the woman he\u2019s speaking to\u2014considering <em>who </em>and <em>what </em>she is\u2014but she doesn\u2019t seem bothered by it. Whatever she\u2019s the goddess of\u2014because Hob refuses to believe this lot aren\u2019t some kind of gods\u2014it must require an astronomical amount of patience.</p>\n<p>\u201cA family,\u201d the woman starts, with just the barest hint of hesitation, \u201cIn Wych Cross. Back in 1916, they\u2026 well, they became awfully lucky, and when the head of the house died in 1926, I had to <em>wait </em>for him, outside the house\u2014like something was stopping me from going inside to get him myself. How odd is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob squints at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d the woman laughs lightly, \u201cYou see, I\u2019m Death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. Okay. Like Hob\u2019s life couldn\u2019t get any more fucking bizarre. He\u2019s hundreds of years old, holding hands with Death over a pub table, discussing the apparent entrapment of her brother, who\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hob says, only a little detached, \u201cAt least I\u2019ve gotten a name out of one of you, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Death blinks at him, surprise turning her gaze owlish. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t told you his <em>name?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>The incredulity in her voice is so thick that Hob can\u2019t help the mildly hysterical laugh that bubbles out of his chest, at least until the rest of her words catch up to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou-You said <em>1916? </em>That was fucking\u2014that was seventy years ago, you think they\u2019ve had him <em>that long?\u201d </em>Hob has experienced such a wild range of emotions over the last ten minutes that it\u2019s a wonder all the shock of it hasn\u2019t given him a heart attack. That\u2019s a death he hasn\u2019t experienced yet, but he feels like he\u2019s inching closer to it the more he speaks to the Grim Reaper.</p>\n<p>The fragile mirth in Death\u2019s expression melts away, and it\u2019s just as unsettling to see her serious as it is to see her without a smile. \u201cMy little brother went missing the same year,\u201d she murmurs. Her gaze drops to their hands on the table. Hob glances at them, too, and is only a little surprised to notice that he\u2019d let go of the glass to return her grasp without even realizing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried to look for him, at first,\u201d Death continues, \u201cBut there\u2019s only one of me, and so many of you, and something is hiding him, besides. That family in Wych Cross; the only reason I suspect them is because of how odd it was that I couldn\u2019t enter the house. Only powerful magic can impede an Endless like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn Endless?\u201d Hob asks, softly, because it feels like a question that needs to be soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we are,\u201d Death responds, trying again for a small smile. \u201cMe and D\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d</em> Hob interrupts, far stronger than he meant to, and Death looks surprised for as long as it takes him to get out, \u201cDon\u2019t, please. I-I want to hear it from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sympathy colors Death\u2019s gaze even as Hob feels his face burn. Six hundred years, Hob thinks\u2014he\u2019ll be damned if he finds out his Stranger\u2019s name from anyone but the odd man himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the family name?\u201d Hob asks. It\u2019s a poor attempt at redirecting, but Death humors him anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cBurgess,\u201d she replies, and somehow, <em>somehow, </em>Hob isn\u2019t even surprised.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d heard of Roderick Burgess, back in the 20s. Christ, who hadn\u2019t? The <em>Magus, </em>that insufferable old man had called himself; the upper crusts loved to flock around that haunted old mansion of his and cling to his tailcoats, tittering and chirping about fortune and luck. Hob had thought it a whole load of bullshit and kept far clear from it, especially after he\u2019d overheard some fancily dressed ladies at another party entirely gossiping in too-loud whispers about a <em>devil </em>locked up in the basement.</p>\n<p>Fucking Hell. A devil in the basement\u2014not a devil at all, Hob realizes now, and <em>burns </em>with the fury of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know exactly where your brother is,\u201d Hob tells Death in a low growl, and the glimmer in her eyes shifts ever so slightly closer to what had been in her brother\u2019s: something sly, powerful, and predatory.</p>\n<p>Hob has no fucking clue how he\u2019s going to get his foot in the door of the Burgess Estate.</p>\n<p>Roderick Burgess has been dead some sixty-odd years. Hob doesn\u2019t even remember when he found out the old man had bit the bullet; the knowledge hadn\u2019t even been a blip on his radar, in one ear and out the other. He knew, distantly, that Burgess had had a son who inherited the Estate\u2014the kid was nothing like his father, if the sudden halt to all the parties and grandeur way back when had been any indication. Little bastard must be pushing towards his nineties now, Hob thinks.</p>\n<p>Death hadn\u2019t had much more information about the Burgess family, last night. She knew humanity, she\u2019d said, but not in the same way her brother did, whatever that meant. The most she could say was that Roderick Burgess\u2014or, rather, his ghost\u2014hadn\u2019t spoken to her at all when she\u2019d arrived to take his soul away, and that she hadn\u2019t guided his son from the living, yet. Which meant that Burgess Junior was still alive, as far as Death knew, and he was the one keeping Hob\u2019s Stranger locked up in the basement.</p>\n<p>Christ, Hob thinks as he climbs out of his car in front of the first petrol station he finds in Wych Cross, he really hopes the basement part is an exaggeration.</p>\n<p>Part of Hob wishes Death was still with him, which was a thought he\u2019s never imagined he would have. The woman\u2014the Endless, that\u2019s what she is, Hob reminds himself\u2014had left the pub not long after Hob\u2019s realization, with an apologetic smile and an acknowledging tilt of her head<em>. \u201cOnly one of me,\u201d</em> she\u2019d said, and in those few words Hob could hear the weight of a routine so ageless it was beyond his comprehension. He had wondered, in that moment, how she did it all, but the answer probably would have melted his brain.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ll try to visit you when I can,\u201d</em> Death had told him, with the lightness of a promise she wasn\u2019t sure she could keep. <em>\u201cWith the magic around the place, I won\u2019t be of any help inside, but maybe you\u2019ll find something we can figure out together.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Hob finds some irony in a literally endless being using the phrase \u2018figure out,\u2019 but that\u2019s neither here nor there.</p>\n<p>The petrol station is far too cold when he steps inside, with dim lights and a young looking cashier burying her nose in a gossip magazine. She hardly glances up at Hob when the bell above the door rings at his entry, and the annoyance that flashes across her face when he steps right up to the counter is a little comical.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you got a map?\u201d Hob starts with, letting his tone lift with confusion. It\u2019s a little too easy these days, faking things\u2014centuries of experience will do that. He\u2019s just glad he doesn\u2019t have use for it often.</p>\n<p>The cashier\u2019s eyebrow twitches, like this is a question she hears on the regular and is incredibly sick of. \u201cListen, mate,\u201d she starts, and Hob winces on the inside at how sickly sweet she\u2019s trying and failing to make her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll wanna turn back where you came from, yeah, and follow that road up for near two kilometers, then\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d Hob interrupts. He offers a bashful smile and rubs the back of his neck when the cashier squints at him. <em>Laying it on thick today, Gadling. </em>\u201cI\u2019m not lost, just looking for someone. It\u2019s been some years since I\u2019ve been out here, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s the someone?\u201d the cashier asks. The fake sweetness from her tone has withered away, replaced by a poor attempt at indifference. She\u2019s curious; Hob\u2019s got her attention. \u201cMight know the name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFamily name\u2019s Burgess,\u201d Hob answers. He doesn\u2019t know Junior\u2019s first name; no one really had. All old man Roderick had blathered about had been his eldest, Randall, and even Hob knows the poor kid bit the bullet back before this cashier\u2019s parents were probably born.</p>\n<p>The young woman\u2019s eyes widen, just a fraction, and Hob briefly worries that he\u2019s just implicated himself in something he doesn\u2019t want a part of, before she says, \u201cFawny Rig\u2019s fuckin\u2019 cursed, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yeah, </em>Hob almost wants to say, <em>But probably not the way you\u2019re thinking.</em></p>\n<p>Instead, he laughs and offers a grin and a, \u201cIs it really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, like,\u201d says the cashier, finally putting down her magazine. She leans forward across the counter, dropping her voice into a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cOld man Burgess <em>hates </em>people. Ain\u2019t nobody gone up there in ages \u2018cept the ones working for him. And <em>they </em>never say what they\u2019re doing there, just some crap about security and bitching about staying up all night. You might as well turn around right now; it ain\u2019t worth shit, what I hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob blinks, thinks for approximately half a moment, then says, \u201cWell, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d frowns the cashier.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo work,\u201d smiles Hob.</p>\n<p>The cashier looks at him like he\u2019s just lost his marbles all over her countertop.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane, I think,\u201d she tells him, bold as brass, and gives him directions to Fawny Rig.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Pulling up the road leading to the mansion, Hob expects\u2026 <em>something. </em>Some grandeur. Security guards lining the front of the place; giant wrought iron gates with intimidating spikes at the top; dead trees and dramatically timed flashes of lightning and maybe a wolf or two lurking at the tree-line, waiting for their moment to strike. Something to justify the way his grip on the steering wheel makes the leather creak and how every bit of him is buzzing with tension.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing.</p>\n<p>The gravel crunches beneath his car\u2019s wheels. The fountain out front is off, the stone of it dirty and weathered. The windows are dark, the lawns empty, not a living, moving thing in sight. As Hob parks beside the fountain and climbs out of the car, a raven cries somewhere he can\u2019t see.</p>\n<p>It looks well and truly abandoned, Hob thinks, and doesn\u2019t know how he feels about that, for about as long as it takes for him to shut his car door and the mansion\u2019s door to swing open.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d calls a man from the doorway. He\u2019s dressed smartly\u2014more than Hob would expect for such a desolate looking place\u2014and looks a bit younger than Hob in appearance, although nowadays that doesn\u2019t mean really anything at all. The look on his face is blatant distrust and suspicion. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, actually!\u201d Hob answers brightly. He lifts his hands up a bit in a gesture of peace, and the man\u2019s expression twists a little in distaste, too. It deepens when Hob starts making his way toward the door, gravel shifting beneath his boots. \u201cI just heard you lot were hiring. Something about security work? Now, I\u2019ve got some under my belt\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not hiring,\u201d says the man darkly. It looks like he\u2019s fighting back a fierce scowl as Hob steps up to the door properly. \u201cYou can leave, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, really?\u201d Hob makes a show of frowning and scratching at the stubble on his cheek. \u201cKnow of anyplace that is, then? None of my work\u2019s really been on the books, if you catch my drift, mate. And I heard good things about this place!\u201d</p>\n<p>The man stares at Hob with narrowed eyes, opens his mouth, and is interrupted by, \u201cAndrew? Is that someone at the door? Goodness, let him in, don\u2019t leave him standing out there!\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice, old and warm, comes from further in the house, and Hob offers his most blinding grin as Andrew\u2019s face twitches and he steps aside to let Hob through.</p>\n<p>Stepping across the threshold of the place doesn\u2019t make him feel any different than he had outside, and Hob tries not to be disappointed by that.</p>\n<p>The inside isn\u2019t much at all what he was expecting. Going down the hall, Andrew at his heels, Hob tries not to stare at the glass cases on either side of him, shelves filled with odds and ends that look like they\u2019d be best in a museum. He spies roughened pages with script he can\u2019t read; gems that shine without light to catch them; stone tablets with fossil prints he doesn\u2019t recognize. It makes Hob uneasy, and he wishes he could attribute the feeling to whatever magic was keeping Death out of the house decades ago, but inside he knows it boils down only to basic human instinct.</p>\n<p>Something in him wants out of here, so he keeps going down the hall.</p>\n<p>It opens up into a sitting room, one with wide windows and welcoming couches. Light pours in through the open curtains, and an older looking man sat on one of the couches looks up from his book as Hob enters, Andrew quick after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d says the old man, beaming. He closes his book and sets it on the table in front of him, then stands, reaching out to shake Hob\u2019s hand. \u201cWelcome, welcome! We never get visitors, anymore. My name is Paul, it\u2019s lovely to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you, sir,\u201d Hob answers dutifully, smiling. It grates him, sometimes, looking at someone centuries younger than him and saying <em>sir, </em>but he bites his tongue. \u201cRobert Goldman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a strong name,\u201d grins Paul. He steps back and returns to his place on the couch, gesturing for Hob to sit in one of the armchairs on the other side of the table. \u201cPlease, make yourself comfortable. Andrew, could you fetch us some tea, please? Or would you like coffee, Robert?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTea is fine,\u201d Hob agrees. He twists a little to look back at Andrew, flashing his first genuine grin. \u201cTwo sugars, please, Andy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Andrew looks like he\u2019s going to start blowing steam out of his ears as he marches away. Hob tries not to take too much pleasure in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Robert,\u201d Paul says, \u201cWhat brings you all the way to Fawny Rig? I adore having guests, of course, but we haven\u2019t had one in a good while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob leans back in the armchair, trying for casual and confident. He reaches it, he knows he does, he\u2019s had centuries of practice\u2014but the unease biting at the inside of his mind is making him far more tense than he\u2019d like to be when he\u2019s playing con to an old man keeping his friend locked up somewhere.</p>\n<p>Unless, a traitorous part of Hob\u2019s mind whispers, they\u2019ve moved his Stranger someplace else. <em>Let\u2019s not think about that, </em>Hob tells it. It\u2019s bad enough he\u2019s here flying by the seat of his fucking pants. There\u2019s something about his Stranger that sweeps the floor out beneath his feet, he thinks mildly, and it\u2019ll probably make this more difficult sometime soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hob starts easily, \u201cI\u2019ve done some off the books work over the years, and that\u2019s not real good for <em>on </em>the books work, yeah? Last job finished up and I heard you lot were hiring, and that you were good for your word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Paul, with all the enthusiasm of a flat tire. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Well that\u2019s not good, </em>Hob thinks. \u201cAre you, then?\u201d Hob asks, laying his tone smooth and light like he isn\u2019t hanging on to the question by his fingernails. \u201cHiring, I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Paul glances behind Hob and grimaces, just barely, as a new voice croaks, \u201cWe are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob turns in the armchair. His gaze lands on another old man, standing in the doorway Andrew had disappeared through. The newcomer is leaning on a cane, his free hand shoved into the pocket of his slacks, a sourness to his expression that Hob suspects is permanent. He glowers as Hob stands, and doesn\u2019t take Hob\u2019s extended handshake.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex, darling,\u201d says Paul quietly, \u201cAre we?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Darling. </em>Hob blinks. Oh. <em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p>So the rumors were true, huh, back in the 20s. Old man\u2019s Burgess Junior was into lads. Only respectable thing about him, Hob thinks, only a little meanly.</p>\n<p>Alex\u2019s gaze cuts past Hob and to Paul, narrowed and sharp. Far clearer than the stare of any other man Hob has seen reach his nineties. Has Alex gotten so old because Death can\u2019t reach him, Hob wonders? He\u2019ll have to ask her the next time he sees her\u2014although a nasty little part of him suspects it may be over Alex\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>Hob steps aside; partially to allow the two men a proper view of each other, mostly to give himself a view of them both. His eyes alight on the wall, and for the first time he notices a stuffed raven sat on a wide dresser, its white breast puffed out with pride. Looking at it, for some reason, makes Hob\u2019s stomach churn.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Alex repeats gruffly. He starts to hobble further into the room, and Hob watches Paul step forward to help him. \u201cFired two of the bastards this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat?\u201d </em>Paul wheezes, panic clear across his face. He puts a hand on Alex\u2019s shoulder and leans down to meet their gazes. \u201cAlex, love, we\u2019ve talked about this. You know it\u2019s difficult replacing people\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got their replacement right here,\u201d says Alex, lifting his cane to point at Hob. Hob just barely leans back in enough time to avoid getting jabbed in the stomach with it. \u201cThey started asking questions. Too many. You won\u2019t do that, will you, boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob feels his eye twitch, just barely. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he forces out.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Alex huffs.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDarling,\u201d </em>Paul implores, \u201cWho was it you let go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alex waves his free hand dismissively as Paul lowers him to the armchair Hob had been occupying. \u201cLast night\u2019s,\u201d he says unhelpfully, \u201cWhatever their bloody names were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex.\u201d Paul looks like he\u2019s going to sit down right on the couch and cry. Hob can\u2019t really blame him; even if Hob didn\u2019t suspect the man\u2019s keeping his Stranger locked up somewhere, Alex seems like one hell of a man to deal with. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got two rotations of guards left. That was one of them. They\u2019re supposed to come back <em>tonight. </em>We can\u2019t replace two people with just one, especially on such short notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob can\u2019t help the way his eyebrows start creeping toward his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I may?\u201d he interrupts, trying to keep his tone light. The men\u2019s gazes turn to him, one pleading and the other spiteful. \u201cNot sure what it is you\u2019re guarding, gentleman, but I know plenty of self defense, and how to keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both of these things are true. Hob\u2019s plenty capable of defending himself, and he\u2019s avoided a number of gruesome deaths by knowing when to keep quiet about something he wasn\u2019t supposed to see. It <em>took </em>a number of gruesome deaths for him to figure it out, but he digresses.</p>\n<p>Something like a smug little glint shines in Alex\u2019s eyes. \u201cTake him to see it,\u201d he tells Paul, who draws in a long breath like he\u2019s asking Mother Mary for patience. \u201cIf he can do it, he\u2019s hired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be coming, love?\u201d asks Paul, with all the grace of a man who has asked before and knows the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cSooner die,\u201d spits Alex.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Hob has a suspicion when Paul makes him wait outside the room he\u2019s lead to, so he doesn\u2019t see how the bookshelf opens to reveal the elevator behind it. The suspicion gets worse when the only direction the elevator goes is <em>down.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI feel I should\u2026 warn you,\u201d Paul says, quietly, as the elevator descends, utterly silent. \u201cIt can be jarring, the first time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>is </em>it?\u201d Hob asks, keeping his voice very carefully even.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you,\u201d Paul laughs. It\u2019s not a happy laugh, or even a light one. Hob can recognize the bitterness of it, the weight of something almost like guilt but not quite like responsibility. \u201cNot until you\u2019ve seen him.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Him. </em>Hob\u2019s blood is pounding in his ears. He wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans.</p>\n<p>The elevator creaks, just ever so slightly, as it hits the end of its drop. The sound is blaringly loud against the stone hallway Hob sees as it opens. Paul steps out, loafers echoing, and gestures for Hob to follow.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark; darker than any man should be comfortable with, being around for longer than necessary. People need sunlight, Hob has learned over his centuries. Sunlight, and fresh air\u2014the air down here is stagnant and wet, and Hob feels suffocated by it. Everything is black and gray stone, throwing their sounds back at them, the rustle of their clothes and the sound of their footsteps and the huffs of their own breaths. The back of Hob\u2019s neck is burning, like something in him knows he shouldn\u2019t be here.</p>\n<p>Paul leads him up to an iron gate. Hob can\u2019t see straight through it, stopped beside the wall as he is, but he can see the two guards sat smoking at a table, and the way one of them leisurely rises to his feet at the sight of Paul.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfternoon, sir,\u201d the guard greets. He stabs out his cigarette in the little glass ashtray on the table and steps up to the gate, the sound of keys jangling sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood afternoon, Michael,\u201d Paul greets back, \u201cHow\u2019s he been?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, same as always,\u201d says Michael. The gate\u2019s lock clicks and he opens one of its doors, stepping aside for Paul to enter. Hob makes to follow. \u201cNot moved at all, not sure he\u2019s even blinked really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob freezes in the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeard Mister Burgess canned Tom and Eric earlier,\u201d says the other guard, still at the table. \u201cThis one of the replacements?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Robert,\u201d Paul introduces gently. \u201cWe\u2019re working that out now, actually. Would you mind, gentlemen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d says Michael. He gestures at his coworker, who puts out his cigarette and stands as well. \u201cSure thing, sir. Holler if you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two men skirt past Hob, turning sideways to get through. The second guard even has the balls to give him a solid pat on the shoulder. Hob can\u2019t bring himself to swing around and punch him, even though he so desperately wants to\u2014he\u2019s not certain he can even bring himself to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Paul whispers, barely a breath, and <em>oh, </em>how Hob wants to punch him, too. Wants to knock his lights out against one of the giant stone pillars holding up the room.</p>\n<p>A cage. A <em>cage. </em>A devil in the basement. Hob\u2019s ears start ringing. <em>It can be jarring, the first time.</em></p>\n<p>A glass cage, in the dark, surrounded by water, like a castle amidst a moat, tall and untouchable. Alone. Naked. So skinny, down to the bones, and hasn\u2019t he always been that small, thin-boned like a bird, but Christ above, not like this\u2014</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s Stranger sits in the center of a glass ball, back straight, legs crossed, wrists resting on his knees like a king on his throne, and Hob is good. He\u2019s good at reading his Stranger.</p>\n<p>Hob watches his Stranger open his eyes, lift his head, and sees the moment recognition dawns.</p>\n<p>Hob watches the twitch forward, the barest lurch to stand, though he stays seated. He watches the wide eyes, the parted lips, the subtlest curl of fingers into fists. He watches the way his Stranger\u2019s gaze flickers over Hob\u2019s own face, up and down over his body, taking him in with utter bafflement, and knows that Paul sees <em>none </em>of it, because it took Hob five hundred years to.</p>\n<p>It feels like parting the ocean, stepping into the room. It feels like Hob is walking through his six hundred years of life all at once, dredging through the pain and the grief of it like the mud of a trench. It feels like he\u2019s finally stepped down into the fires of Hell, and he <em>burns. </em>Hob Gadling <em>burns </em>with the fury of it.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until Paul puts an arm out to stop him, not unkindly, that Hob realizes he\u2019d damn near been about to run straight up to that fucking glass ball and throw his fist against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobert,\u201d Paul says gently, putting his opposite hand on Hob\u2019s shoulder, \u201cListen, I know it\u2019s a shock, but he isn\u2019t human, okay? It\u2019s not\u2014it isn\u2019t like\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t seem to get the rest of the sentence out, but Hob hears it anyway. <em>It\u2019s not like the war. It\u2019s not like the camps.</em></p>\n<p>Hob almost wants to laugh at the absurdity of it.</p>\n<p>Paul thinks Hob wants to break the glass because of what stained the world, barely forty five years ago now. That hadn\u2019t even occurred to Hob in his anger, though now it\u2019s all he can see\u2014his best friend, his truest friend, the one he would wait six centuries again and more for until the end of time and all creation, trapped and hidden from the world like something subhuman.</p>\n<p><em>He isn\u2019t human. </em>Oh, but Hob\u2019s Stranger is so very more human than even the man himself wants to admit.</p>\n<p>Hob can feel himself shaking. Paul slowly removes his arm, though doesn\u2019t take his hand from Hob\u2019s shoulder. Hob doesn\u2019t miss the way his Stranger\u2019s eyes land on the contact and stay there.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak,\u201d Paul says quietly. From his peripheral, Hob can see the other man watching his Stranger, something like sadness coloring his expression. \u201cNot to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI think you\u2019re lonely.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t move, even. Doesn\u2019t act anything like a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou dare suggest one such as I might need your companionship.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s something terrible, I know,\u201d Paul whispers. \u201cNothing any creature should endure. But Alex is convinced he\u2019ll kill us all if he\u2019s freed. He\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t belong with this world, Robert.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He belongs with me, </em>Hob thinks, fiercely, and can\u2019t even find it in himself to smother the idea like he has so many other times for so many centuries now. <em>He won\u2019t have to kill any of you\u2014I\u2019ll do it for him.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cListen,\u201d Paul murmurs, \u201cI understand if you can\u2019t do the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s Stranger\u2019s eyes flash back to him. They\u2019d been shining, that night in 1889. Hob remembers being surprised\u2014he hadn\u2019t thought such an otherworldly being ever capable of something so human as tears. Those eyes are shining now, in the dim light of this fucking basement, locked on him through that fucking glass, though his Stranger\u2019s face is also as stony cold as before, too.</p>\n<p>Paul continues, \u201cWe\u2019ll still give you a courtesy payment, of course, for your silence\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hob croaks. His voice isn\u2019t strong. It shakes and bows like a tree in a storm, and he swallows thickly, blinking harshly against the still air weighing down on him, sitting between him and his Stranger like a wall. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll take the job. You said tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>His Stranger\u2019s head tilts upwards, just ever so slightly.</p>\n<p>From his peripheral, Hob sees Paul look between the two of them. He sees the old man\u2019s frown; the way it shifts from sympathetic to thoughtful. He sees the way Paul glances downwards, brows furrowed. Hob follows the gaze, tearing his eyes away from his Stranger with something like physical effort, and finds a circle of runes painted yellow on the bricks beneath the cage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Paul says, quietly. He squeezes Hob\u2019s shoulder, and when Hob lifts his eyes to meet the old man\u2019s, he sees understanding there.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s enough to make his heart stop, just for as long as it takes Paul to smile, small and sad and knowing, and agree, \u201cGood, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob exhales\u2014barely a breath, thin and shaking and heavy with six centuries\u2014and looks back to the cage.</p>\n<p><em>\u201c</em>Let\u2019s get back upstairs and discuss the details, shall we?\u201d says Paul.</p>\n<p><em>Tonight, </em>Hob thinks to his Stranger like a prayer, and can only hope he hears it.</p>\n<p>Hob drives.</p>\n<p>The road leading to Fawny Rig is long and empty, boxed in on either side by forest. The trees flash by in Hob\u2019s peripherals, like the same footage looped over and over. The clock in the manor had read 3:23 in the afternoon when he left. He has to be back there in less than six hours.</p>\n<p>Hob has less than six hours to figure out how he\u2019s doing to get his Stranger out of that fucking prison.</p>\n<p>The car\u2019s wheels growl unhappily as Hob hits the brakes in the middle of the road. He\u2019s far enough from the manor that all he can see in either direction is gravel road and forest. When he climbs out and slams the door behind him, the whole car shakes, and the sound of it echoes thinly through the air, gone far faster than any noise in that basement had been.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s killing him, worse than he\u2019s ever died before. It\u2019s killing him, being out here, in fresh air and the scent of trees and grass and nature, the sound of wildlife as it picks up around the quiet rumble of the car\u2019s engine and Hob\u2019s heavy breathing. It\u2019s killing him, wanting so fucking badly to go back into that manor, guns blazing and teeth bared, and take a nice heavy bat to every panel of that glass ball and then some, subtlety be damned.</p>\n<p>Hob turns so he can slam both his fists down atop the roof of the car, because he <em>can\u2019t. </em>Not yet. Not if he wants to get them both out of there unharmed.</p>\n<p>Hitting something feels good, in that moment, so Hob kicks one of the tires, too. It\u2019s a poor kick, one that sends him off balance; he stumbles back a few steps and then just opens his mouth and <em>screams, </em>lets out all of his fury and horror and despair into the fresh air of a road leading to a prison. A murder of crows takes off from the trees, screeching back, and the rest of the wildlife falls silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Death of the Endless, \u201cThat\u2019s a greeting if I ever heard one.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cJesus!\u201d </em>Hob shouts, whirling. Death is leaning her shoulder casually against one of the trees on the edge of the road, hands in the pockets of her jacket. She\u2019s watching Hob like he\u2019s a particularly interesting puzzle, but she\u2019s far easier to read than her brother\u2014Hob recognizes expectation in her gaze as soon as it rises. \u201cFucking Hell, do you do that shit to everybody?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Death smiles. \u201cMy siblings can sense me, and humans don\u2019t always see me. Nice to get away with it, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Hob, and\u2014oh boy, even he can hear the hysteria starting to creep up into his voice.</p>\n<p>Death\u2019s smile melts away. Her brow furrows, mouth pinched, and she straightens up from the tree. \u201cWhat happened, Hob?\u201d she asks, gently, as she steps up properly onto the road.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Hob starts, and the words catch in his throat, strangling him, and there they are, the tears\u2014he\u2019s been waiting for them.</p>\n<p>Death looks startled, briefly, as Hob lifts a hand to cover his mouth. It feels like the world is tilting sideways around him and he can\u2019t keep up with it; his legs buckle and he drops to sit on his feet right there on the gravel road, fat tears drowning his vision. His other hand grips the fabric of his jeans at his knee, pulling so tight that his leg starts to ache with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHob?\u201d Death murmurs, soft as anyone Hob\u2019s ever heard, and it only makes him cry harder.</p>\n<p>Time passes strangely as he sits in the road and cries. The sounds of wildlife slowly filter back into the air, unbothered by Hob\u2019s breakdown. Death, at some point, lowers herself to the ground beside him, one knee bent to rest her elbow on, her opposite hand rubbing gentle lines up and down his back.</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s never been a pretty crier. He cries loud, and ugly, and dirty; he uses the hem of his shirt and the sleeves of his jacket to wipe at his face more than once. His palms are soaked from swiping at his eyes, and he knows his face is red, and he has to draw shaky breaths in through his mouth, his nose too blocked to have any hope. And yet he can\u2019t find it in himself to be embarrassed\u2014something tells him Death has seen far more people at their worse than just him.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t say anything, as Hob catches his breath. Just rubs his back, up and down, slow and easy, like it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world.</p>\n<p>The car is still running next to them. Some detached part of Hob recognizes he\u2019s wasting gas, letting it sit like that. The rest of him couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck.</p>\n<p>It feels like there\u2019s words stuck on his tongue, catching on his teeth and pulling. The first time he tries to speak, all that comes out is a thin, pathetic croak; Hob groans and covers his face with his hands, uncaring of the still damp tears on his palms that he spreads across his cheeks all over again. Death huffs a soft laugh, not unkindly.</p>\n<p>Drawing a deep, slow breath, Hob lets his hands drop back down into his lap. He stares across the road at the trees and swallows at the sight of a raven stood at the edge of the gravel, tipping its head back and forth to watch the two of them. It reminds him of the white-breasted one in the manor, stuffed on the dresser.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got him,\u201d Hob forces out, finally, barely more than a whisper. Death\u2019s hand stills on his back. The raven straightens up, opens its wings, and takes off into the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got him,\u201d Hob repeats, finally turning his gaze to meet Death\u2019s. She looks stricken, her own eyes wide. She really is so much easier to read than her brother. \u201cIn-In the <em>basement. </em>The fucking basement, Death. In a-a <em>cage\u2014\u201d </em>Hob\u2019s voice cracks, \u201c\u2014like some <em>animal.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Death\u2019s expression darkens. Hob watches her jaw clench as she averts her eyes, staring up the road in the direction of the manor. The air around the two of them turns icy cold, fast and without mercy; Hob\u2019s breath mists out in front of him, curling upwards and away.</p>\n<p>The fury of Death, he realizes very quickly, is a dangerous thing to incur.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to get him out,\u201d Hob murmurs, desperation bleeding thick through his voice.</p>\n<p>Death sighs, deep and tired, tearing her gaze away from the road and back to Hob. The air warms again slowly, and Hob can\u2019t help the shiver that runs through him with the change. Death offers a smile, small and apologetic, but he can tell her mind is someplace else; her eyes don\u2019t focus clearly on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow exactly are they keeping him?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>Hob scratches at the fabric of his jeans and swallows. \u201cThe cage, it\u2019s like a-a fucking snow globe. Round glass, up above the ground with chains. They built a\u2014like a little moat, in the ground, around it, and there\u2019s a circle painted on the floor\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA circle?\u201d Death interrupts. She adjusts so she can lean further into Hob\u2019s space, meeting his eyes\u2014and Hob feels frozen there, like a deer spotted by a wolf. \u201cCould you tell what was written in it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014no,\u201d Hob admits shakily, \u201cIt looked like a lot of runes and other shit I couldn\u2019t read. Definitely old, but\u2014the paint looked fresh, like they\u2019ve been going over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeeping the magic strong,\u201d Death says almost in a growl, scowling. Hob feels fear rush cold through his blood at the expression for exactly as long as it takes Death to break their eye contact. The release is like a wave, washing the tension away from his muscles, though only for a moment\u2014it returns as soon as the gravity of everything hits him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to get him out,\u201d Death admits. She chews on her lip for a moment. \u201cThat magic has been keeping his powers at bay for seventy years; breaking the circle might make it implode.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cImplode?\u201d </em>parrots Hob with a thin little laugh, only slightly hysterical.</p>\n<p>Death shoots him a brief, apologetic look. \u201cIf it were me or our other siblings, we\u2019d be able to handle the backlash,\u201d she admits, \u201cBut since the magic that\u2019s keeping him there is also keeping us <em>out, </em>well\u2026 It might be dangerous, Hob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hob tries, \u201cAt least I can\u2019t die, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Death starts, then stops, then blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hob asks. The otherworldly woman\u2019s gaze returns to him properly, and they stare at each other for a moment, Death\u2019s eyes slightly wide. Hob stresses, <em>\u201cWhat?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 not sure, actually,\u201d says Death.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014what? You\u2019re <em>not sure </em>if I <em>can\u2019t die?\u201d </em>Hob feels like he might start crying again.<em> \u201c</em>You\u2019re-You\u2019re <em>Death!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Death agrees, looking puzzled about it, \u201cBut I also can\u2019t get into the manor. Which means it\u2019s blocking out my magic, somehow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2014well.\u201d Hob is doing his very best not to feel nauseous. \u201cWell, how has\u2014how\u2019s it worked, this whole time? When I\u2019ve died before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Death shrugs.</p>\n<p>That is the <em>last </em>thing Hob wants to see when he\u2019s speaking to the Grim Reaper about how he might <em>actually </em>die. About how death might be a real threat for the first time in six hundred years.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Hob blurts, and this time the hysteria in his voice is thick and layered. He laughs, shrill and loud, and climbs to his feet, valiantly ignoring the burning ache in his knees from having sat on them so long. Fear is suffocating him, gripping his throat in both hands, and he finds himself struggling to breathe. \u201cGreat! Awesome, even! That explains why I hate being in that hellhole, then! I could-could fucking <em>die </em>doing this, for real this time, a-and I\u2014fucking Hell, I don\u2019t even know if he would <em>care, </em>do I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHob,\u201d Death interrupts sharply. Hob hears her stand as well, gravel crunching beneath her boots, but he\u2019s too busy shoving his hands into his hair to look at her again. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if you <em>will </em>be in any real danger, and of course he would <em>care. </em>You\u2019re his best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m his <em>best </em>friend, am I?!\u201d Hob explodes. He whips around to face Death; his elbow almost slams into her sternum with the force of it, but she takes a step back and regards him with a wary expression, confusion shining in her gaze. \u201cHis <em>best </em>friend? As-As far as he\u2019s concerned, I\u2019m not even <em>a </em>friend! The second I called him one, he stood up and stormed off saying he\u2019ll prove me wrong, and I\u2014I don\u2019t even know his fucking name! Some friend that is, I think!\u201d</p>\n<p>Another laugh rips itself from Hob\u2019s chest, sharp as a knife, and dies out in a groan as he drops his face in his hands. \u201cAnd I\u2019m,\u201d he says into his palms, \u201cI\u2019m just-just fucking hopeless, aren\u2019t I? Because I\u2019m still gonna go get him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not hopelessness, Hob,\u201d Death says, softly. Hob feels her hand rest on his shoulder, featherlight. \u201cThat\u2019s just love.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound that leaps from Hob\u2019s throat is somewhere between another hysterical laugh and an utterly pathetic sob\u2014because that\u2019s just it, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>Forget Hell. Hob doesn\u2019t need that when he had to look into the eyes of the one he\u2019s loved for centuries, with a glass cage and an unknowable magic and a decades-old fight between them, and turn away, no matter his promise to return.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Hob sniffs, dropping his hands from his face so he can wipe roughly at his nose with the hem of his sleeve, \u201cFat lot of good love\u2019ll do me, getting him out of there. You, ah\u2014you got any ideas, then? Preferably that don\u2019t involve getting blown up by magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a poor attempt at deflection. Death\u2019s mouth twists into a frown, and Hob can almost laugh at the resemblance; it\u2019s the same look her brother\u2019s given him half a dozen times before, like neither of them can quite believe what level of stupidity he\u2019s dancing on this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cA few,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p><em>A few </em>turns out to be <em>two, </em>and those are: <em>break the glass </em>and <em>if that doesn\u2019t work, break the circle and cross your fingers.</em></p>\n<p>Hob wishes that this whole ordeal wasn\u2019t making him start to think that maybe the cosmic entities of the world know what they\u2019re doing only about as much as any other bloke stumbling around the street corner.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been an eventful some-odd amount of hours. Hob hasn\u2019t really been keeping track. He didn\u2019t exactly sleep last night, after Death left the pub and he wandered back to his flat; the night had passed in a blur of sitting on his couch and staring at the wall, stewing.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s kind of what he wants to do again, he thinks as he closes the door of his flat behind him. A glance at his clock says 4:46 PM. Barely four hours to go. That\u2019s enough time for wall-staring, right?</p>\n<p>Something taps on glass.</p>\n<p>Hob looks from his clock to the window across the room from the door, and makes eye contact with a bloody massive raven, holding in its beak the handles of a plastic bag emblazoned with the logo of Hob\u2019s favorite Chinese takeout place.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Hob, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve gone insane, finally.\u201d</p>\n<p>The raven leans down to set the takeout bag on the sill beside it, opens its beak, and responds, muffled through the window, \u201cNo, actually! Good assumption, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob stares at the raven. The raven stares at Hob. Hob seriously considers leaving right back out the door of his flat and returning to the pub and having a drink or several, because each time he starts to think his life can\u2019t get any weirder, something proves him wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, uh,\u201d says the raven, \u201cYou gonna let me in, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>It taps on the glass with its beak for good measure.</p>\n<p>Hob almost wants to ignore it. Almost wants to close the blinds and sit on the couch and let himself just stop thinking for a few hours more, because his life has been inconsolably turned upside down in far too little time. He\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s made it this far with only one breakdown, even if that one was in the middle of a road with the personification of Death consoling him.</p>\n<p>But Hob also hasn\u2019t eaten since well before the pub yesterday, and he\u2019d really like some takeout.</p>\n<p>The raven flaps its wings a bit to keep its balance as Hob opens the window. Once it\u2019s able to, it hops inside and launches itself from the sill to land neatly on the table in front of Hob\u2019s couch, tapping its feet a few times against the wood. Hob grabs the takeout bag and leaves the window open to shuffle to the couch himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe looked through your dreams for your order,\u201d the raven says helpfully as Hob sits and starts removing the containers. \u201cSesame chicken and pork fried rice. I\u2019m Matthew, by the way. Oh, that one\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>That list bit is said when Hob opens one of the containers to find beef lo mein. He blinks at it, looks at the raven, and sets it on the table in front of the bird. \u201cThanks,\u201d says Matthew, reaching out with one little foot to drag the container closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you eat that?\u201d Hob asks, baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Matthew, tipping its\u2014his?\u2014head. \u201cY\u2019know, I haven\u2019t tried yet, but I think I\u2019m a dream, technically, so it should be fine, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hob responds, and opens his container of chicken.</p>\n<p>They eat in silence for a while. Hob watches Matthew work out how to eat his lo mein; he never thought he\u2019d see a raven try to chew a noodle like a person. To Matthew\u2019s credit, he realizes quickly that small chunks swallowed whole seem to work best for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Matthew prompts after his first successful bite of beef, \u201cYou\u2019re not, uh, surprised? Like at all? By this, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Hob says around a mouthful of chicken, \u201cI stopped being surprised when I found out my friend is Death\u2019s little brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Matthew ruffles his feathers a bit. \u201cI mean, yeah, I can see that. But don\u2019t you have questions? I mean, I did, when I woke up as a bird! I still kind of do, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoke up as a bird?\u201d Hob asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Matthew starts, \u201cI used to be a person, too, but I guess I died in my sleep, and now I\u2019m like this. This nice lady named Lucienne said I belong to the Dreaming, and to Dr\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Hob interrupts, for the second time, and points his fork at Matthew. \u201cDon\u2019t say his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Matthew, \u201cOkay. Any reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to hear it from him.\u201d Hob sets down his container and runs his hands over his face. \u201cSix centuries and you\u2019d think I\u2019d know it already, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSix cent\u2014huh?!\u201d Matthew crows, literally. \u201cHow-How <em>old </em>are you? How do you know D\u2014uh, y-your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob can\u2019t help the amused snort that escapes his chest. He parts his fingers enough to peer at the raven through them. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone through my dreams,\u201d he says lightly, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-Well, <em>I </em>didn\u2019t go through them,\u201d Matthew corrects, feathers puffing up. \u201cLucienne did. And it wasn\u2019t really your dreams, just a-a book with your whole life in it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bird blinks, then adds, \u201cJesus. Six centuries\u2014no wonder your book was so fucking big.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob laughs, and it\u2019s the first genuine laugh he\u2019s had since Death sat at the pub table.</p>\n<p>They talk and finish their food. Hob learns that his friend is the cosmic overlord of <em>dreams, </em>of all things, which he supposes makes sense but also doesn\u2019t. A man so stoic and difficult to read being the physical manifestation of all of humanity\u2019s dreams\u2014there\u2019s an irony in there, somewhere, one Hob is too exhausted to dissect.</p>\n<p>Matthew admits to being the raven Hob had seen on the road, earlier. Lucienne had sent him, he says; Lucienne the Librarian of the Dreaming, Hob\u2019s Stranger\u2019s <em>kingdom, </em>which is apparently in utter disrepair in his absence. Hob\u2019s Stranger is a <em>king.</em></p>\n<p>It explains, Hob thinks, a lot more than the dreaming part does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all quite a fucking lot, really, and Hob feels like his head spins as he tries to wrap his mind around it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did Lucienne know to look for me?\u201d he asks Matthew, pushing the last bits of his rice around with his fork. He never did get the hang of chopsticks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d Matthew admits. He\u2019s picking at the edge of his empty container with his talons. \u201cI guess maybe she knew that you and Boss are friends? Well, not maybe\u2014she has the book on your life. And humans can get around in this world a lot easier than dreams can, according to her. And, well, when I saw you with Death, that was a pretty obvious clue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Hob sets his container down on the table and leans back into the couch. \u201cHow\u2019d she know I\u2019d even do anything? To help, I mean? How did Death know I would?\u201d</p>\n<p>Matthew turns his head to the side to stare at Hob with one eye and rustles his wings. \u201cIs that a trick question?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Matthew presses. He hops to the edge of the table and then jumps to stand on the couch beside Hob. \u201cListen, maybe I\u2019m not the brightest guy\u2014er, bird\u2014on the planet, but even I can see that you really care about Boss. What would\u2019ve stopped you from trying to rescue him?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a real possibility he could be in danger, and that said danger could lead to his very real death. There\u2019s a decades-old argument weighing on his shoulders and in the shining eyes of his Stranger on a night in 1889. There\u2019s a confession he hasn\u2019t even quite given to himself yet, much less the otherworldly being he <em>dared</em> to call his friend\u2014and was spurned even for that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not even a question, not to Hob.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he admits, softly.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Matthew follows at a distance as Hob returns to Fawny Rig.</p>\n<p>Like Death, there isn\u2019t much the bird is certain he\u2019ll be able to help with. It isn\u2019t like Hob can smuggle a raven into the basement with him, and he\u2019s pushing the luck that life is giving him enough, weaseling his way into being alone in that prison with his Stranger.</p>\n<p>Alone with him. For the first time\u2026 ever, actually.</p>\n<p>What a bitter thought, that Hob\u2019s first chance to speak to his Stranger in true privacy is only because the other is in a <em>prison.</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s Paul who greets Hob at the door, this time. They exchange pleasantries, but Paul seems determined not to offer conversation, and Hob has no complaints. Andrew and Alex are nowhere in sight. Paul makes Hob wait outside the room, again, and sends him down alone.</p>\n<p>The elevator is just as suffocating as earlier. The creak at the bottom is just as horribly loud.</p>\n<p>This time, Michael and the other guard are waiting in the hallway outside the gate. It\u2019s obvious that they\u2019re eager to leave; the other guard gets once glance at Hob and makes his way up the hallway toward the elevator, offering little more than a half-salute in farewell.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d says Michael, gesturing for Hob\u2019s hand. \u201cForced march tablets. You\u2019ll be real buzzed for a second, but they\u2019ll keep you up for the night. There\u2019s a pistol in the drawer in the table, but you won\u2019t really need it\u2014more precaution than anything, yanno? And the keys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob is gifted two small pills and a key ring. It\u2019s far too easy to slip the pills under his tongue and make a show of a swallow and a grimace. Michael huffs a laugh and offers a hearty pat on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you in twelve hours, mate,\u201d he says, and away he goes, not bothering to wait for a response from Hob.</p>\n<p>It feels like years, listening for the elevator\u2019s creak as it ascends.</p>\n<p>Hob spits the pills onto the floor beside his feet and scrambles with the keys to unlock the gate. He nearly drops them twice, his hands are shaking so badly.</p>\n<p>When the gate swings open, its key still in the lock, and Hob stumbles through and races up to the cage, his Stranger is already standing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHob Gadling,\u201d he says, in that insufferably beautiful voice of his, and Hob could almost break down all over again\u2014because that voice shakes the way it did in 1889, and Hob aches with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the <em>fuck,\u201d </em>Hob demands, his own words trembling, \u201cDid you get in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s got his hands up against the glass, palms flat like if he wills it enough he could open the cage just like that. His breath catches in his throat as his Stranger presses his own hands against the glass from the inside, over Hob\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d says his Stranger, and Hob wheezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour sister,\u201d he explains, and laughs a little at the way the other\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cDeath, uh\u2014s-she came to tell me you weren\u2019t standing me up, this time. Said you\u2019ve been missing, fucking\u2014seventy years, Christ, a-and I met your raven\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy raven?\u201d his Stranger interrupts sharply. Hob watches his brow knit. \u201cWhat raven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMatthew,\u201d Hob says. \u201cHe, uh\u2014he\u2019s new, I guess. Lucienne said you won\u2019t know him, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou spoke to Lucienne?\u201d his Stranger asks, and the confusion that colors his voice and his face is the most expressive Hob has seen him in centuries.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, just\u2014\u201d Hob steps back and tears his eyes away, though his hands don\u2019t leave the glass, covering his Stranger\u2019s palms on the other side. His gaze darts over the cage, soaking in the metal beams connecting the panels and the chains keeping it afloat. \u201cFucking Hell, we don\u2019t have time for this, I need to get you out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe circle,\u201d his Stranger supplies immediately.</p>\n<p>Hob laughs again, more than a little strangled. \u201cThat, uh, that could kill me, actually!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat?\u201d </em>his Stranger demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeath can\u2019t get in.\u201d Christ, how is he ever going to break this thing? \u201cSo, uh, that\u2014y\u2019know, breaking the circle, she said it could make your magic explode, and she-she doesn\u2019t know if I can\u2019t actually die in here, so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHob,\u201d </em>his Stranger interrupts, and it\u2019s so forceful that the breath escape Hob\u2019s lungs, his eyes snapping back down to lock their gazes.</p>\n<p>Hob could get lost in those eyes. He has before, many times. There\u2019s something otherworldly to them, something almost hypnotic, though Hob hardly needs hypnotism when he\u2019s already hopelessly wrapped around this man\u2019s finger. They stare at each other for what feels like an eternity, and Hob drinks in the sight of his Stranger.</p>\n<p>His hair is different. A little longer\u2014wilder. He looks emaciated, like a man barely a whisper away from a death by starvation. His hands, pressed against Hob\u2019s through the glass, are thin and long-fingered, and Hob wishes so terribly to hold them in his own, to wrap his Stranger up and hide him away on the couch in his flat with takeout Chinese and as many soft and warm things his kingly heart desires.</p>\n<p>When their eyes meet again, Hob feels his face burn with the realization that his Stranger had been taking in the sight of him, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d his mouth asks, without permission from his mind first.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s something beautiful, watching his Stranger\u2019s expression soften. Watching surprise flash across those eyes, then realization, then understanding. Watching the barest ghost of a smile pull at that mouth that Hob wants so desperately, in that moment, to kiss.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s less beautiful, watching his Stranger\u2019s gaze break away from his, flashing over Hob\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s less beautiful, watching them widen and darken and shine from the inside. It\u2019s less beautiful, seeing the fear painted clear as day on that face, so open and raw that Hob could see it even if he didn\u2019t have six hundred year\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s less beautiful, hearing the gunshot\u2014and feeling the pain.</p>\n<p>Hob has been shot before.</p>\n<p>Of course he has; he\u2019s been in wars. He\u2019s seen the darker sides of life, the ones that lurk in empty street alleys and prey on innocent people with false promises of sweet nothing. Hob has been shot and shot other people\u2014he\u2019s familiar with the sound of gunfire and the blooming pain that comes with bullets.</p>\n<p>That being said: Hob hasn\u2019t been shot in a <em>long time.</em></p>\n<p>The pain that pierces the back of his left shoulder is merciless, ripping through his chest and down his arm. A strangled shout leaps from his mouth at the impact of it. His opposite hand flies to grip the wound on instinct and the movement sends him off balance; his uninjured shoulder hits the glass and he drops down to his knees, sparing a brief thought toward guilt that it makes the cage rattle unpleasantly.</p>\n<p>He can feel blood, hot and slick, seeping between his fingers, and he clenches his jaw against the sensation of it. The edges of his vision blur with tears, and for a moment he thinks he can feel his heartbeat in the whole of him\u2014before he realizes it\u2019s the glass rattling, and looks up to see his Stranger knelt inside, looking terrified.</p>\n<p>Hob starts, through gritted teeth, \u201cIt\u2019s fi\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His Stranger\u2019s eyes snap upward, and Hob has just enough time to follow the gaze before a kick catches him in the chest.</p>\n<p>Hob hits the ground on his back with a yelp, one that breaks into another shout as his injured shoulder scrapes against the stone. He groans, blinking furiously through the pain, and wheezes when a heavy boot lands on his chest and pushes down.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me why I shouldn\u2019t kill you,\u201d growls Andrew, leveling his pistol down at Hob\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s head is spinning, sending the room lurching, and it feels like Andrew\u2019s boot on his chest may as well be an anvil. He reaches up and grabs at Andrew\u2019s ankle with both hands. \u201cWell,\u201d he coughs up at the man, struggling for breath, \u201cIt\u2019d be real fucking inconvenient.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob pushes.</p>\n<p>Andrew stumbles back, thrown off balance, and Hob rolls to the side just as the gun goes off again, the bullet burrowing itself against the stone where his head had been. Immediately, Hob\u2019s ears split into a furious ringing, high-pitched and overwhelming, and it catches him off guard just long enough for another kick to land on his ribs.</p>\n<p>The force behind it shoves him to roll further, and Hob finds himself subject to a brief and terrifying drop over the edge of the platform, down into the water.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s far deeper than anything built into a basement has any right to be. Hob feels his body sink far faster than he wants it to, and it takes quite a bit of flailing to orient himself to grip the edge of the platform and drag himself up. His shoulder flares angrily with pain. When his head breaks the surface, gasping and spluttering, he catches a glimpse of his Stranger; the otherworldly man is banging on the inside of his cage, mouthing something that Hob can\u2019t hear over the ringing in his ears. It looks like, for a moment, <em>\u201cNot again.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Andrew blocks the view, dropping down to one knee and tossing his gun aside, and grabs Hob\u2019s hair to shove his head back beneath the water.</p>\n<p>Hob thrashes. The water is frigid and dark, even more so as Hob\u2019s blood spreads through it. His hands go immediately to Andrew\u2019s arm, clawing and hitting. All of the movement makes it feel like he\u2019s being shot all over again, and the pain of it makes him open his mouth to cry out, air escaping his lungs in bubbles through the water. His feet find no purchase, knees banging against the stone of what he can only assume is the submerged half of the platform as he struggles. Water rushes down his throat, into his nose, suffocating\u2014</p>\n<p>Andrew drags him back up by his hair. Hob chokes and gasps as his head breaks the water, digging his nails with as much force as he can muster into Andrew\u2019s wrist. He watches as the man speaks, lips forming words Hob still can\u2019t hear over his ears\u2019 ringing, before anger darkens Andrew\u2019s face, screws his mouth up in a scowl, and he pushes Hob back under.</p>\n<p><em>I could die, </em>Hob thinks quite suddenly, as he punches blindly against Andrew\u2019s forearm. <em>I could die here. I\u2019m going to die here.</em></p>\n<p>His Stranger\u2019s gaze, soft and knowing, fills Hob\u2019s mind. His Stranger\u2019s fear, the terror painted so plainly on that face, burns at the inside of his eyelids. The shape of his Stranger\u2019s mouth forming <em>not again </em>pushes ice through his blood.</p>\n<p>Andrew drags Hob back up. The ringing in his ears is subsiding, replaced with the thick clogging of sound that comes with keeping his head beneath water.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014give me the Estate,\u201d Andrew is hissing, \u201cAnd you want to <em>ruin it\u2014\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Hob can see, just around the other man, his Stranger.</p>\n<p>Trapped in the glass, stood back up now, pounding his fists against the inside like it will get him anywhere. There are tears in his eyes, running freely down those thin cheeks, desperation shining from the inside. Hob\u2019s blood is splattered across the outside of the glass from the gunshot, and from the angle Hob is looking at it, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s covering his Stranger\u2019s chest, cutting across from one side to the other.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cPlease,\u201d </em>his Stranger begs, in as thin and broken a voice Hob has ever heard, \u201cNot again, please\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s eyes fall from his Stranger to the circle. Water and blood has sloshed across the platform from all the struggle, soaking atop the paint.</p>\n<p>Andrew yanks fiercely on Hob\u2019s hair, forcing his gaze back to the other man\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Andrew growls, \u201cAnd keep that <em>thing </em>in its cage, and get the fucking money I\u2019ve spent my whole life begging that old bastard for, do you understand? You <em>pathetic</em> little\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you kill me\u2014\u201d Hob bares his teeth in a grin, reveling in how it makes Andrew recoil. \u201c\u2014then you\u2019re coming down to Hell with me, Andy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob reaches forward with one hand, gripping the front of Andrew\u2019s coat and <em>pulling, </em>dragging the man down into the water with him with a shout.</p>\n<p>His other hand, blood-stained, reaches out across the stone floor and drags itself through the paint of the circle, breaking it.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHob!\u201d </em>his Stranger shouts, just before Hob\u2019s head goes back under the water.</p>\n<p>Andrew is clawing at him, grabbing at shirt and jacket and skin alike, grappling for anything he can use for purchase. He finds Hob\u2019s injured shoulder and <em>yanks, </em>and Hob shouts into the water with the pain of it, lashing out with fists and feet. They\u2019re both fighting blind in dark, blood-clouded water\u2014Andrew\u2019s fist hits Hob\u2019s jaw, Hob\u2019s foot hits Andrew\u2019s chest, something hits Hob\u2019s side with a sudden burst of pain and so with one mighty shove Hob <em>kicks.</em></p>\n<p>A thud reverbs through the water, and Andrew stops fighting.</p>\n<p>Hob can see the outline of him, in the water; the barest silhouette. Something begins to cloud around his head, lifting up as he sinks. Hob kicks toward the surface.</p>\n<p>When he breaks it, coughing and gasping and choking for air, clawing at the edge of the platform for purchase, it\u2019s to the sound of his Stranger shouting, voice cracked and strangled with tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cHob!\u201d he hollers, banging his fists against the glass. \u201cSpeak to me! I swear to all creation, Robert Gadling, if you die\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot dying,\u201d Hob wheezes as he finally finds a grip in the bricks. Agonizingly slow, he begins to drag himself out of the water. \u201cC-Can\u2019t\u2014fuck\u2014g-get rid of me th-that easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>The water was fucking frigid, and Hob\u2019s entire body is shaking with cold and pain, sending his teeth chattering and his bones aching. It feels like his limbs weigh tons as he forces himself over the edge of the platform, landing on his hands and knees on the stone. He coughs, grimaces, and feels his stomach seize; water, blood, and takeout stain the stone between his hands as he vomits.</p>\n<p>\u201cHob,\u201d croaks his Stranger, thin and weak, \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes far more effort than it should, but Hob obeys, shuddering.</p>\n<p>His Stranger\u2019s face is streaked with tears. There\u2019s exhaustion and fear and relief all painted in those eyes, pale blue as Hob has always known them. Some detached part of Hob finds it a little funny, how pretty of a crier his Stranger is. Not a red face or runny nose in sight.</p>\n<p>Hob must look like a fucking mess in comparison, sopping wet and covered in blood and shivering over his own bile.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Morpheus,\u201d says his Stranger.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other as Hob\u2019s pain-addled brain turns over. Hob blinks. His Stranger\u2014<em>Morpheus\u2014</em>knits his brow. A soft frown pulls at his mouth the longer Hob keeps silent.</p>\n<p>Rather abruptly, and without his permission, a laugh leaps from Hob\u2019s chest, and he drops his head to let it hang, wheezing with amusement on his hands and knees, bleeding from a bullet wound on the stone ground of his greatest friend\u2019s prison.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d demands Morpheus, just a little haughtily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Hob admits, choking a little on his laugh, \u201cThat I didn\u2019t find that out in this fucking basement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Morpheus, significantly more haughtily, \u201cYou asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob coughs out another laugh, because <em>that\u2019s </em>his Stranger\u2014his Morpheus. His love. Kingly as the day is long, and snooty to match it. He really is like a cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Slowly, Hob starts climbing to his feet. It feels like an effort to rival Atlas. His shoulder is crying out with pain; his chest aches from swallowed water and exertion. His side is stinging where Andrew hit him. His knees tremble like earthquakes. \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable, do\u2014d\u2019you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHob,\u201d </em>Morpheus breathes, and for a second Hob thinks he\u2019s going to get scolded for calling a king insufferable\u2014but when he turns his gaze to his friend\u2019s, Morpheus is staring downwards, eyes dark again and wide with horror.</p>\n<p>Hob follows the stare, and finds fresh blood blooming a dark stain from his stomach, welding the knife-sized hole in his shirt to the wound.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014yeah, th-that\u2019s pretty inconvenient. Anyway\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAnyway?\u201d </em>Morpheus echoes, and it sounds like he\u2019s ready for murder. His palms are pressed against the inside of the glass, but Hob can see them shaking; see the whole of him shaking, really, like a thin branch in a storm. \u201cThere is no <em>anyway, </em>Hob Gadling\u2014you are severely wounded\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2014ah, fuck\u2014\u201d Hob hisses through his teeth as he bends to grab Andrew\u2019s discarded pistol. His right hand presses down on the knife wound\u2014because of course it had to be on the same side as the bullet\u2014and he grimaces at the feeling of fresher blood running slick past his fingers. \u201cWouldn\u2019t say <em>severely. </em>I\u2019ve survived worse\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cUnder Death\u2019s protection,\u201d </strong>booms Morpheus, and Hob shudders with the power of it. It\u2019s no louder than he\u2019s been speaking the whole time, but there\u2019s <em>intent </em>behind it now, dark and all-encompassing. Despite that, Hob doesn\u2019t find himself frightened like he had been in the face of Death\u2019s anger; although he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because of the adrenaline or because of how hopeless he is for this incomprehensible King of Dreams.</p>\n<p>\u201cStand back from the glass,\u201d Hob instructs, and when Morpheus opens his mouth to argue, adds, <em>\u201cNow, </em>love, or neither of us are getting out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob watches his friend\u2019s eyes go wide, watches them wash away from starry dark to the pale blue he\u2019s so familiar with, and spares his own thought of <em>ah, fuck, </em>because he definitely hadn\u2019t meant to say that. He\u2019ll blame it on delirium, Hob decides, as Morpheus slowly steps back to press himself against the far side of the cage.</p>\n<p>The gunshots are loud, and Hob flinches with the recoil of each of them as it pushes back against his injured shoulder. The pistol only gives him three bullets, but even the cage seems to have given up. The glass shatters and falls away, and Morpheus is darting to freedom before Hob\u2019s even tossed the gun in the water to sink with Andrew\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>Whatever Hob was expecting upon getting his friend out of that cage, it definitely wasn\u2019t Morpheus hitting him with the force of a truck, burying that gaunt face of his in Hob\u2019s uninjured shoulder and snaking those thin arms around Hob\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Hob wheezes lightly with the impact; it sends him half a step back, but he\u2019s always been bulkier than Morpheus, and even wounded it\u2019s ridiculously easy to accept the sudden weight. His body is burning with pain and exertion, ears ringing faint again from the gunshots, and he quite feels like he\u2019s going to pass out\u2014and yet, slowly looping the arm not focused on his knife wound around Morpheus\u2019s shoulders, Hob might as well have been in Heaven.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispers, smartly, and drops his head to press his face into that ridiculous hair. It smells like winter and lightning and black tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought,\u201d says Morpheus, quiet and muffled into Hob\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI was going to lose you, Hob Gadling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hob admits in little more than a breath. He feels Morpheus grip the back of his jacket, bunching the fabric up between his fingers. Swallowing, Hob adjusts his hold to press his hand gently against the back of the other\u2019s head. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stand like that for Hob isn\u2019t sure how long. They\u2019re both trembling, holding each other like one might disappear if the other lets go. Hob spares a brief thought to the realization that he must be getting blood all over the both of them, but Morpheus seems unbothered; he\u2019s clinging to Hob like a frightened child holds their only toy in the world, leeching as much comfort from it as they can.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s when Hob is starting to get light-headed and doing his best to breathe through it that he hears the rustle of feathers and the sound of boots on stone.</p>\n<p>Morpheus doesn\u2019t move as Hob lifts his head to blink wearily at their surroundings. It\u2019s just as dark and dank as before\u2014it\u2019s starting to smell like blood and mildew, although maybe that\u2019s just Hob\u2014but Death looks entirely unaffected, as she stands at the edge of the platform and peers down into the water, hands in her pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says cheerily, turning her head a bit to flash Hob a smile, \u201cAt least nothing exploded.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus tightens his grip even more on Hob\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Hob, a bit haltingly. \u201cAre you, ah\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Death reassures lightly, like it had never even been a question. Hob can\u2019t help the half-hearted scowl that pulls at his face, though Death only grins back. She takes a hand from her pocket to point down at the water. \u201cI\u2019m just here for him, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>A hand breaks the surface, followed by Andrew\u2019s head and shoulders, gasping and coughing.</p>\n<p>Hob damn near jumps out of his skin. He rushes back a few steps, taking Morpheus with him; the Dream King follows willingly, hardly breaking his grip on Hob, though when they settle in place again his shoulders shake lightly. It takes a few seconds longer than Hob would like to realize Morpheus is <em>laughing </em>at him, quiet little huffs of breath into Hob\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you <em>fucker,\u201d </em>Hob hisses down at him, \u201cYou knew that would happen!\u201d</p>\n<p>Andrew is spluttering as he drags himself onto the platform, hacking water the same as Hob had. He\u2019s soaked, dripping over the stone, and his eyes are wide and wild as they flash over his new audience. They settle on Hob, fury burning in them, and Hob tenses, tightening his grip on Morpheus.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t come to my defense,\u201d Morpheus mutters into Hob\u2019s shoulder, though he doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s complaining.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Hob snarks down at him half-heartedly.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou!\u201d </em>Andrew snarls. He scrambles to his feet, swaying unsteadily. Hob winces at the blue coloring the man\u2019s lips. \u201cYou-You\u2019ve ruined <em>everything! </em>Why aren\u2019t you dead?! You a-and that <em>thing\u2014!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d Death interrupts firmly. Hob marvels at how steady her voice is, void of both compassion and condemnation. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Andrew\u2019s gaze flashes to her. Hob is reminded, suddenly, of an animal cornered, as he watches realization dawn on the man\u2019s face, followed quickly by fear. \u201cN-No, <em>no, </em>not after everything I\u2019ve done, everything I have to do\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob hides his face back in Morpheus\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Death says, quiet as a whisper and yet clearer than anything Hob\u2019s ever heard. Andrew\u2019s pleas grow louder, more desperate, begging\u2014and Hob hears the flap of wings and then silence.</p>\n<p>When Hob draws in his next breath, the pain in his stomach has disappeared, healed over by the miracle that is his body\u2019s refusal to die. His shoulder aches with the bullet stuck in it still, but it\u2019s a pain he\u2019d be willing to endure millions of times again, if it got him to where he is now.</p>\n<p>Sopping wet and blood-stained, shot and shivering as he is, Hob Gadling is alive, holding the love of his life against himself, content.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, you two,\u201d says Death, in the most elder-sister teasing tone Hob\u2019s ever heard, \u201cWe should probably get you out of here before Alex Burgess starts to wonder why his son isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis <em>what?\u201d </em>Hob blurts, snapping his head back up to stare at her. Morpheus huffs another muffled not-laugh.</p>\n<p>Death blinks. \u201cHob,\u201d she says, an incredulous grin pulling at her mouth, \u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to you at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>thought </em>he was their <em>butler,\u201d </em>Hob wheezes, \u201cA-And they\u2019re <em>gay!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAdoption, Hob Gadling,\u201d says Morpheus into Hob\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Hob complains down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d Morpheus hums.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Hob isn\u2019t exactly sure how Death does it. She instructs him to close his eyes\u2014so he doesn\u2019t ruin the magic, she tells him with a shit-eating grin\u2014and Hob does. There\u2019s a feeling in his gut like going down a tall hill in his car, except ten times worse, and when he opens his eyes again, still holding onto Morpheus, they\u2019re standing in the middle of Hob\u2019s flat.</p>\n<p>Huh, Hob thinks, staring at the open window where he\u2019d let Matthew in. He forgot to close that.</p>\n<p>Death tosses one of Hob\u2019s throw blankets over Morpheus\u2019s head, hitting Hob in the face with it in the process. It\u2019s patterned with black cats, and Hob can\u2019t help his snort of amusement at it; he\u2019d bought it from a little gift shop some months ago because it reminded him of Morpheus.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake care of him,\u201d she says. Her smile is soft and knowing. Hob isn\u2019t sure which one of them she\u2019s speaking to. \u201cYou know where to find me when you can, little brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus makes a noncommittal noise. Hob glances down at him, hidden under the blanket, and when he looks back up, Death is gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy car is still back there,\u201d Hob realizes lightly. He can\u2019t really find it in himself to care. Buying a new one will be pennies, with the amount of wealth he\u2019s gathered over six hundred years.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is still a bullet in your shoulder,\u201d Morpheus reminds him from beneath the blanket.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Hob agrees. He reaches up and lifts the edge of the blanket. Morpheus blinks up at him, slow and leisurely like a cat woken from its nap. \u201cWill you let go of me so I can get it out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus squints like this is something he has to seriously consider. \u201cFor a price,\u201d he says, after a moment.</p>\n<p>Hob raises a brow. \u201cWhat could the oh so almighty King of Dreams want from\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus tips up on his toes and kisses Hob into silence.</p>\n<p>Forget Heaven\u2014Hob has stumbled into Eden itself.</p>\n<p>A squeak of surprise leaps from Hob\u2019s chest, though he melts just as quickly, putty in Morpheus\u2019s hands as the other reaches up to cradle Hob\u2019s jaw in one palm, featherlight. It\u2019s a chaste kiss, calm and gentle. Hob knows his lips are chapped, that he must taste like blood and bile and the water from the basement, and yet Morpheus kisses him as sweetly as though it were the most romantic thing on this plane or any other.</p>\n<p>Morpheus, for his part, tastes like rain.</p>\n<p>When Morpheus breaks the kiss, pulling away and looking smug as any cat who\u2019s gotten the cream, Hob can do little more than blink, starstruck. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes, an utterly dopey grin pulling at his mouth, \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good price.\u201d</p>\n<p>The small smile that tugs at the corner of Morpheus\u2019s lips could fuel Hob for decades. That, and the cat-patterned throw blanket still draped over his head, flattening his hair and making for possibly the cutest thing Hob has ever seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us remove the bullet,\u201d Morpheus says, matter-of-fact, underneath the cat blanket, and really, Hob\u2019s life has gotten so damn weird, and he\u2019s adoring every second of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s maybe get you some clothes, first,\u201d he decides, huffing a quiet laugh of his own.</p>\n<p>Morpheus blinks, glances down at himself, and frowns, like it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s noticing his nakedness. Hob reaches up and adjusts the blanket to sit around the other\u2019s thin shoulders, enveloping like a cape. Morpheus runs his fingers over one of the black cats with something Hob can almost confidently call fondness, his other hand holding the blanket closed around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cModesty is a rather human concept,\u201d Morpheus observes airily as he follows Hob to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, love, not sure if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Hob hums, \u201cBut I\u2019m human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you are,\u201d Morpheus agrees, with a thoughtfulness in his tone that Hob decides he\u2019s not even going to try to dissect right now.</p>\n<p>The King of Dreams hovers in the doorway of Hob\u2019s bedroom as Hob rummages through his dresser. There isn\u2019t much he\u2019ll have with a proper fit; Morpheus is bone-thin and shorter than Hob, and Hob likes his clothes a little bigger besides. He had been planning to do laundry today, funnily enough; the idea of something so mundane after how the last day has been feels incredibly far off.</p>\n<p>Hob comes away from his search with a faded Guns N Roses t-shirt and sweatpants he doesn\u2019t ever remember wearing, but that at least have a drawstring, unlike most of his other pairs. Morpheus raises one kingly brow when Hob offers up the clothes, and Hob responds by tossing the shirt at his head.</p>\n<p>Morpheus raises a hand and catches it with little fanfare, but it seems to be the only prompt he needs to actually get dressed. The clothes are, predictably, almost comically large on him, and Hob wonders at how this otherworldly man can look so put together even when the hem of his sweats fall under his bare feet when he walks. The cat blanket remains draped over his shoulders like a cape.</p>\n<p>Getting the bullet out of Hob\u2019s shoulder is unpleasant at best and an ordeal at worst. He keeps medical equipment in his bathroom cupboards\u2014trips to hospital are lengthy and bothersome when it\u2019s for a gun wound\u2014but because the shot went through his back, Hob can\u2019t exactly reach it with the forceps. Morpheus, watching in the doorway, puffs up like an alley cat when Hob holds the tool out to him, instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot be serious,\u201d the King of Dreams argues, staring at the forceps as if they\u2019re going to bite him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Hob lightly, standing inside his bathtub, shirtless. His ripped and bloodied shirt and coat are on the floor beside the sink. There\u2019s clean sweats waiting for him on the toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s either this, or I have to find some real doctor to do it for me, and they\u2019re going to have plenty of questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus stares at Hob like he\u2019s questioning whether Hob lost his brain, somewhere between the bedroom and the bathroom. It\u2019s the same look the cashier gave him this morning, actually.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy, love,\u201d Hob promises, shaking the forceps a bit, \u201cIt\u2019ll start healing as soon as it\u2019s out.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is true. The knife wound in Hob\u2019s stomach has already closed itself to a silvery scar, one of many scattered across his front and back. It\u2019d been an interesting thing to learn, way back when; that Hob\u2019s body will heal the wounds, but not the scars.</p>\n<p>Morpheus looks up at the ceiling, and Hob recognizes the expression distinctly as one of a man asking for patience.</p>\n<p>Very carefully, Morpheus sets the cat blanket down on the floor outside the bathroom and steps up to the tub, taking the forceps from Hob like they may explode. Hob leans down to press a kiss against the other\u2019s forehead before he turns to present his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about hurting me,\u201d he says to the wall. He feels Morpheus rest a hand on his uninjured shoulder. \u201cJust g\u2014<em>ah, fucking</em> Christ!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pain in Hob\u2019s shoulder like he\u2019s been stabbed again, a horrible wet squelch, and then Morpheus holds the bloody forceps, bullet and all, out for Hob to examine.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cJesus,\u201d </em>Hob wheezes, as he takes the forceps from the other\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re a right little monster, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo some,\u201d Morpheus agrees, though when Hob glances back at him, his brows are knit, expression tight as he lifts a little packet of sanitation wipes from Hob\u2019s medical kit.</p>\n<p>Hob, in one of his conscious moments of wisdom, lets Morpheus clean him up with slow and gentle touches. He decides not to mention that he can already feel the wound closing by the time Morpheus ties off the last of the bandages.</p>\n<p>They leave the bloodied wipes and forceps in the tub. Hob changes into his own clean sweatpants and tosses his ruined clothes in with the rest of it. Morpheus picks the cat blanket back up from the floor and wraps it around himself again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure about you,\u201d Hob says, softly, reaching up to card his hand through Morpheus\u2019s hair as the other drops his forehead onto Hob\u2019s good shoulder, \u201cBut I think I could use a lie down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Morpheus, with such inarguable conviction that it makes Hob laugh.</p>\n<p>They end up on the couch; Hob sprawls on his back and finds himself with a Dream King between his legs, wrapped up in the cat blanket, burying his face in Hob\u2019s chest. Morpheus snakes his arms around Hob and seems to melt there, and Hob doesn\u2019t try to fight the stupid grin that pulls at his mouth as he pets one hand over his friend\u2019s hair, the other drawing idle lines up and down his back.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot for them to talk about, Hob knows. Surely a lot for Morpheus to do, if what Matthew said about the Dreaming being in disrepair is as serious as Hob imagines it is. He wonders if Alex Burgess will be after them\u2014after Hob, for stealing his prize and killing his apparent son. Hob can\u2019t find it in himself to be sorry about Andrew. He can\u2019t find it in himself to be sorry about any of them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>For now, though\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling?\u201d Hob murmurs. Morpheus hums in question. \u201cCan we, ah\u2026 can we scrap the every hundred years bit, now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus lifts his head from Hob\u2019s chest, adjusting a bit to lean up on his elbows, and there\u2019s the look like he\u2019s wondering if Hob is stupid again.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobert Gadling,\u201d says the King of Dreams, very strongly, \u201cIf you think you are going to keep me away any more than my position demands, perhaps you\u2019ve been struck about the head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob grins, wide and adoring, and is rewarded again with a kiss.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014for now, Hob is happy.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling?\u201d Hob calls from the front hall, juggling paper grocery bags and struggling to push the door closed behind him with one foot. He can\u2019t see in front of him over the bags, but he at least hears the click of the latch as the door finally succumbs to his kicks and closes. Shivering, he stomps on top of the doormat, trying to dislodge the snow from his boots. \u201cI know you\u2019re in, Mor! I saw Matthew trying to hide outside. Don\u2019t think you won\u2019t be helping with dinner\u2014Rose and Jed are coming over tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Mrew! Mrew! Mrew! </em>howls a little voice from further inside Hob\u2019s house.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d says Hob into his grocery bags.</p>\n<p>Struggling a bit, Hob manages to kneel down enough to set the bags on the floor. There\u2019s nothing terribly perishable in them, so they\u2019ll survive; worst case scenario, the bottoms of the bags will end up wet from melted snow.</p>\n<p><em>Mrew! Mrew! </em>yelps the little voice again, somewhere closer now.</p>\n<p>Frowning, Hob pauses to untie the laces of his boots, carefully avoiding stepping in the snow puddles with his socks. He sets the boots on the shoe rack and hums when he spots Morpheus\u2019s own boots\u2014not at all fit for winter, though he refuses to listen to Hob about getting proper ones\u2014on the other end.</p>\n<p>Standing back up, Hob turns further inside, and stops.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a bloody massive cat, all fluffy black fur and slow-blinking golden eyes, sitting beside the stairs, staring up at Hob. And hanging by its scruff from the bigger cat\u2019s mouth is a tiny, rather put-upon gray kitten, wiggling its little heart out and shouting <em>mrew! mrew! mrew!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMor, love,\u201d Hob says, lifting a hand to cover his mouth, \u201cDid you catnap someone\u2019s baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>Saying <em>someone </em>in reference to a cat is still a bit of a novel thing for Hob. It\u2019s been some years since he found out that his partner is not only the King of Dreams but also the King of <em>Cats, </em>and can fucking turn into one to boot. To say Hob had felt vindicated for his all times comparing Morpheus to a cat would be an understatement.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time Hob has seen Morpheus as his cat-self; sometimes the Endless simply likes to lounge, and it\u2019s not uncommon for him to demand time napping in Hob\u2019s lap on a lazy afternoon like any other housecat. Hob\u2019s had suspicions for some time that the roaming cats who like to frequent his front porch probably just sense that their king resides here, some days. They certainly don\u2019t seem to complain about the bits of chicken Hob always gives them.</p>\n<p>Now, though, Morpheus simply flattens his ears and narrows his eyes. <em>Mrew! </em>yelps his wiggly charge.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it <em>your </em>baby?\u201d Hob asks, raising his brows.</p>\n<p>Morpheus, unlike normal cats, doesn\u2019t have any pupil or iris, but the way he stands up and turns to march away into the kitchen, kitten and all, gives Hob the sense that he was just treated to a massive eyeroll.</p>\n<p>When Hob gathers the grocery bags again and follows, setting them carefully down on the island counter, Morpheus is a man again, cradling the kitten in his hands. He is, predictably, in one of Hob\u2019s AC/DC shirts, the hems of oversized sweatpants falling over his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey brought her to me,\u201d Morpheus hums, stroking one thumb over the kitten\u2019s head. She puffs up and continues to attempt escape; she almost sends herself toppling over the edge of Morpheus\u2019s palm before he stops her. \u201cThey found her outside, with no mother or siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob\u2019s heart just about melts.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of the mothers can take her?\u201d he asks, softly. All of the cats around here have homes, he knows; they all saunter across his porch and rub on his legs without fear, and usually wear some collar or another. It\u2019s a good neighborhood, this place\u2014Hob is happy he found it, and even happier still that the real estate agency hadn\u2019t bat an eye at the purchase of a four bedroom house by a seemingly single man using nothing but cash.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of them currently have kits for her to nurse with,\u201d Morpheus tells him, \u201cNor do they suspect their people would allow them, besides.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks up from the kitten and to Hob, a shine in his eyes that Hob is all too familiar with, and Hob can\u2019t help the smile that pulls at his mouth. \u201cYou want to keep her?\u201d he guesses, though it\u2019s not a question.</p>\n<p>Morpheus blinks slowly. \u201cIt has been\u2026 some time,\u201d he admits, dropping his gaze back to the kitten. She\u2019s settled for chewing on his thumb in retaliation for her imprisonment. \u201cSince I have had a child. By blood or otherwise. And the Dreaming is no place for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMor, love,\u201d Hob interrupts gently, stepping forward to drop a kiss on his partner\u2019s forehead, \u201cOf course she can stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus relaxes, a miniscule uncoil of muscle, beneath Hob\u2019s assurance. Between them, still cradled in Morpheus\u2019s hands, the kitten hollers a particularly pouty <em>mrew!</em></p>\n<p>Hob laughs, looking down at her. \u201cI should probably head back out, then\u2014she\u2019s gonna need litter, and food, and toys\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already requested Rose to pick them up on her way,\u201d Morpheus informs, looking more than a bit full of himself for his forward thinking.</p>\n<p>Hob raises a brow. \u201cDid you tell her why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Morpheus blinks and looks back down to the kitten.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hob grins. \u201cWell, hold her there a minute, well you? Let me find the thermometer; we should make sure she\u2019s warmed up from being outside. Here, take my phone, start Googling good vets nearby, love; she\u2019ll need her shots, and we\u2019re getting her spayed. I don\u2019t want grandbabies.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the owlish look Morpheus shoots him, kitten in one hand and phone in the other, Hob starts to suspect that things like <em>vet care </em>hadn\u2019t occurred to the King of Cats.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you gonna name her?\u201d Jed asks, teasing the kitten with the tail of a stuffed toy mouse. The mouse, Hob observes, is almost as big as she is. She\u2019s still doing her best to maul it, squeaking furiously whenever Jed pulls it just out of her short reach.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re sitting on the floor, atop the same cat-patterned blanket Hob bought over thirty years ago, now. He hasn\u2019t asked Morpheus how it\u2019s miraculously survived its age, and Morpheus hasn\u2019t bothered to tell him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t yet thought of that,\u201d says the Dream King now, sitting on the couch very regally in Hob\u2019s worn out band t-shirt and sweatpants. He\u2019s holding an oversized mug of tea with both hands. Hob has to bite his lip to keep from snickering when Morpheus sips from it and flashes the pouty looking black cat printed on the bottom.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d says Rose, on the couch next to Morpheus, \u201cJed should name her, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her cosmic entity of an uncle shoots her a narrowed look from the corner of his eye, and Rose flashes him a brilliant grin, bleeding innocence and good intentions.</p>\n<p>\u201cSandy!\u201d Jed declares immediately.</p>\n<p>Hob doesn\u2019t bother trying not to laugh, this time.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Hob wakes up to a sharp and furry weight on his chest, and opens his eyes to the sight of a cat\u2019s nose against his.</p>\n<p>Morpheus is stood over the bed, arms outstretched and hands open, and Hob huffs a laugh with the knowledge that he probably carried Sandy under her armpits the whole way to Hob, as he is wont to do. He\u2019s fully dressed, this time, long black coat and all.</p>\n<p>Both the Dream King\u2019s and the cat\u2019s eyes shine from the inside in the darkness of the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake,\u201d grumbles Morpheus, \u201cYour daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so she\u2019s just <em>my </em>daughter now, is she?\u201d Hob asks, reaching up to rub a hand over Sandy\u2019s head. She purrs and digs her claws into his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe <em>insists,\u201d </em>complains Morpheus, a bit louder over Sandy\u2019s indignant meow, \u201cOn interrupting my work. She refuses to stay with Lucienne like I instruct her\u2014do not speak back to me, young lady, or you will not be visiting Fiddler\u2019s Green next time you come to the Dreaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwh, c\u2019mon, bird,\u201d Hob snickers, \u201cThat\u2019s a little harsh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Mrooooow! </em>agrees Sandy, loudly.</p>\n<p>Morpheus glares down at the both of them, turns in a huff and a dramatic flare of coat, and disappears through the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, darling,\u201d Hob says to Sandy, still kneading biscuits on his chest, \u201cLet\u2019s get to sleep. We\u2019ll go bother him together.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>Hob is making breakfast, still blinking through sleep and trying to remember if he finished grading last night\u2019s papers, when the scent of chocolate and strawberries overwhelms the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Des,\u201d Hob says down to his eggs. Sandy was sitting at his feet, hoping for scraps, but she abandons her post to scurry up to the island counter. Hob glances over his shoulder and raises an eyebrow at his partner\u2019s sibling, sat at the counter, leaning far too forward over it to stroke a hand down the cat\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Robert, darling,\u201d Desire purrs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I telling Mor you\u2019re visiting?\u201d Hob asks, looking back to his eggs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know he\u2019s still fuming at me over Rose,\u201d Desire giggles, \u201cOf <em>course</em> you should tell him. But maybe later, so we don\u2019t get blood on your lovely tiles, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob briefly thinks back to the first time Desire visited the house, and the hole in the plaster he\u2019d had to repair afterwards. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees, stifling a yawn, \u201cProlly best. Eggs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot today, gorgeous,\u201d Desire hums. When Hob shuts off the stovetop and turns to get a plate, they\u2019ve made their way up <em>onto </em>the island counter, laying on their back with Sandy loafing on their chest. They\u2019re scratching behind her ears, grinning brightly, and Sandy is purring like she\u2019s making a business out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you come to bother me,\u201d Hob asks, \u201cOr to see your niece?\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Desire flashes him is sly and trouble-making. Hob has seen it on Death and Morpheus both a number of times, though the other two Endless are never so carnal about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Desire says, lowering their voice in a way Hob is sure has gotten them into plenty of beds, \u201cWhat am I <em>ever </em>here for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you,\u201d Hob says, as he has a hundred times before, and grabs a plate to put his eggs on.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame a whore for trying,\u201d Desire concedes cheerily, as they have a hundred times before, and returns to petting Sandy.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cDesire did <em>what?\u201d </em>Morpheus growls, eyes flashing, later that night.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Rob?\u201d asks one of his university students, \u201cWhat\u2019s, uh\u2014y\u2019know. How\u2019s it going, mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hob groans from where he\u2019s buried his head in his arms, slouched over his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cBand\u2019s new,\u201d comments another student lightly. \u201cYou got somethin\u2019 to tell us, Rob?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoneymoon must have been killer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat even <em>is </em>that? It don\u2019t look like silver, but it definitely ain\u2019t gold. You go and get hitched with some off market ring, Robbie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTungsten,\u201d Hob says into his arms. \u201cSo it won\u2019t break.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it won\u2019t <em>break?\u201d </em>someone echoes. \u201cJesus, mate, your new lady think you\u2019ll go \u2018round punching diamond?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNew <em>man, </em>idiot,\u201d someone else barks. \u201cAin\u2019t you seen them at the pub?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit! Pretty one, Rob, you got good taste!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, that goth bloke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously he ain\u2019t <em>goth, </em>he\u2019s like\u2014alternative.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just goth, genius. You seen that eyeliner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever he is, shame he\u2019s off the market now. Guess only place anybody else\u2019ll find \u2018em is their dreams.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s scattered laughs, ones that pick up at the expense of Hob\u2019s even louder, long suffering groan.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you, bird,\u201d Hob murmurs, smoothing a hand over Morpheus\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not going back. It\u2019s all done, love. We\u2019re right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The King of Dreams clutches the back of Hob\u2019s shirt, face buried in the shoulder with a bullet scar on the back. Hob pulls the cat blanket tighter around the both of them, sitting on the kitchen floor. Sandy is laying neatly on Morpheus\u2019s foot, eyes closed, purring. Moonlight is streaming thin through the windows, though Hob doesn\u2019t see much of it; they\u2019re all huddled up beneath the island counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me,\u201d Hob whispers, \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere. I\u2019m not leaving. They\u2019re not getting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He presses a kiss, featherlight, on his partner\u2019s head, and Morpheus\u2019s grip loosens ever so slowly, bit by bit. Hob can feel the ring there\u2014black and solid, shining all the way around.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019d have to get through Sandy, first,\u201d Hob says quietly, and Morpheus huffs a breathless little laugh against his shoulder.</p>"
