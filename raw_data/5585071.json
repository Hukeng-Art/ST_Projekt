  "text": "<p>\u201cI cannot deal with this. I refuse to deal with this. Why me, Rey?\u201d</p>\n<p>She peers at him thoughtfully from behind the water tank. It\u2019s a gift from Admiral Ackbar, who heard her talking about plants growing by the nearby lake with one of the ground crew officers. He found her the tank and shared some of the plants from his quarters and she\u2019s fascinated by it. It\u2019s filled with water and serves no other purpose than be decorative, and there are <i>plants</i> in it.</p>\n<p>He said that some people also kept fish in those.</p>\n<p>Finn plops on her cot and sighs heavily, then once again for good measure. \u201cTell me, how is he even real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about Poe here?\u201d Rey clarifies, though there is only one person on the base, nay, in the galaxy, who brings out this level of exasperation in Finn. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes we\u2019re talking about Poe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat has he done this time?\u201d she asks knowingly. This is becoming a regular occurrence, to be honest, something like this comes up every other day since she\u2019s been back. She doesn\u2019t mind at all, though she suspects Finn would be happy to break this particular routine.</p>\n<p>Luke is away to \u2018find an old friend\u2019 on whom he hasn\u2019t elaborated and all she has to do is keep up with her training and\u2026 no, that\u2019s pretty much it. After years of work-filled days and sleepless, short Jakku nights, not having much to do is eerie. And no matter whom she asks, no one comes up with any tasks for her.</p>\n<p>She sinks down to the cot next to Finn and he raises his arms to let her throw her legs over his knees. \u201cAlright, tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s cooking me dinner,\u201d he says in a tone of voice of someone announcing the world is ending. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice?\u201d she tries and doesn\u2019t laugh when he glares at her. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe were getting breakfast, missed you by the way, and it was the brown thing again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I like the brown thing,\u201d she nods. It\u2019s a meat stew with some sort of brown vegetables she\u2019s never heard of before, crispy and filling. It\u2019s not as good as the spicy flat cakes they make sometimes, but definitely in her top three. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my favourite thing,\u201d Finn agrees. \u201cI mentioned that and apparently I have been appallingly depraved of good food for my whole life and Poe is making me dinner tonight and Rey, I cannot deal with this. You know he\u2019s going to turn out to be amazing at this and I\u2019ll have to spend the evening sitting across from him and <i>his hair</i> and the food is going to be great and what do I do then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring me leftovers?\u201d she laughs and then yelps when he tickles her foot in retaliation, then kicks his thigh. \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t end up eating everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I know Poe, there\u2019s gonna be more food than anyone could eat in a week. You know how he gets.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does know how he gets, she has stacks of datapads with holovids of flight manoeuvres from the Rebel Alliance days that has been forced on her, stacks of blueprints ordered specifically for her, even a potted tree from Eiatu VI Poe presented her with after one of his away missions. BB-8 informed her Poe flew with the tree in his lap, so it wouldn\u2019t get damaged in the cargo hold.</p>\n<p>So she does have some sympathy for Finn\u2019s predicament, yes, but not in the way he thinks. Because the regular complaints sessions paint Poe as a daring holovid hero with windswept hair and a perfect line for each occasion and while some of that holds true, he is a man who piloted an X-wing with a potted tree in his lap.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also a man who flusters at Finn\u2019s smile and who once literally sat on his hands and muttered \u2018what the fuck\u2019 at least seven times while watching Finn training some of the Resistance soldiers in the First Order tactics. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s not quite sure what to say, because Finn would never believe this. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can cancel,\u201d she says sympathetically and Finn closes his eyes, his head falling against the wall with a loud thump. \u201cAnd bring something to drink? Jess said it\u2019s what you do when you visit somebody,\u201d she shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he says emphatically and Rey doesn\u2019t say the most obvious thing. Maybe the patience training finally started to pay off. </p>\n<p>Then he sits up again. \u201cWhat do I bring? By drink you mean alcohol? Of course, yeah. Where do I get alcohol?\u201d</p>\n<p>She might need a couple more training sessions. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Poe must have done something to deserve this, he\u2019s just not sure if it was something really good or really terrible. Finn shows up five minutes before their scheduled meeting, his hair damp from the shower, in a dark grey shirt that looks like it\u2019s been freshly ironed, and holding a bottle of corellian whiskey scrounged up from somewhere. </p>\n<p>He leans against the doorframe and Poe just about drops the dishtowel. He\u2019s pretty damn sure he\u2019s had dreams that started like this. </p>\n<p>\u201cMan, something smells good,\u201d he says with a smile and Poe steps aside to let him in, wiping his suddenly sweaty palms with the dishtowel. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteak,\u201d he blurts out, the dryness in his throat guaranteeing a fifty-fifty chance on his voice coming out either ridiculously hoarse or a good octave higher than usual. It comes out low, and rough like he hasn\u2019t spoken in weeks. </p>\n<p>\u201cMan, never had those, that sounds great,\u201d Finn says cheerfully, pushing the bottle into Poe\u2019s hand. \u201cI have it on a good authority that it\u2019s one of your favourites?\u201d</p>\n<p>It is, and though it\u2019s not exactly a secret, Finn must have asked one of his pilots and then actually procured a bottle, possibly in the time since breakfast. He\u2019s not quite sure what to do with this thoughtfulness, except for busying himself with glasses and handing one to Finn. </p>\n<p>He inspects the glass carefully then looks up at Poe, the corner of his mouth pulled up in a wry grin. \u201cI\u2019ve never actually had whiskey before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother first for tonight, then,\u201d Poe says and oh, kill him now. The worst part is that Finn glances at him with a quick smile that looks a little shy, and he obviously has no idea, does he. How fucked Poe is right now, what effect he has. \u201cOkay then,\u201d he mutters on exhale. \u201cPull up a chair, it won\u2019t be a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, no worries,\u201d Finn says, smile audible in his voice even though Poe can\u2019t see it, busying himself with finishing up on the meal. \u201cHey, did you get redecorate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way of asking if I cleaned up, isn\u2019t it? Had to make room for the stove.\u201d His quarters on the new base were big enough to have a little kitchenette space, but he hasn\u2019t bothered before to stock it - he had to borrow the portable appliance from the pilots\u2019 rec room. </p>\n<p>The whole day has been frantic, because in his excitement to show Finn some real food, not what passes for it in the mess (admittedly not the worst on-base food he had, but still on-base food) he\u2019s invited him over for the evening of the same day, completely blanking out on the fact that he\u2019d need to get supplies. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s cooked in the rec room before, but that wouldn\u2019t do now - the vultures would descend immediately. Snap and Niv helped him carry the stove and he now owes more favours to the quartermaster than he\u2019s comfortable with, but he\u2019s managed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Finn tells him when Poe puts a plate in front of him, but digs in eagerly, licking his lips in anticipation and yeah, Poe really did. \u201cOh man,\u201d he says after the first bite, closing his eyes and humming in appreciation, a blissed out expression on his face and Poe is pretty sure he\u2019s staring, fork halfway to his mouth, but fuck. </p>\n<p>Fuck, okay. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d is all he can manage, reaching out for his glass and downing half of it, the smooth and smokey flavour of the whiskey hitting the back of his throat a little too fast. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s amazing. Absolutely the best thing I\u2019ve ever had in my mouth, though as you\u2019ve already gathered, that list isn\u2019t long or interesting,\u201d Finn grins before eating more, making appreciative noises about the food that go straight to Poe\u2019s dick and this was a terrible idea, absolutely the worst.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already wondering what he should cook for the next time, because he\u2019s an idiot with no self-preservation and terrible decision making habits. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea how good this is,\u201d Finn tells him before chuckling at himself with a little shake of his head. \u201cI mean, you probably do, since you made this. And I don\u2019t care what I promised Rey, I love her, but she\u2019s not getting leftovers, I\u2019m gonna eat all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Rey,\u201d Poe mutters, running his hand down his face. His cheeks are a little flushed, but he could explain that as an effect of cooking on the hot stove. If he was asked. \u201cI should have invited her, I didn\u2019t think\u2026 I could get her,\u201d he adds, rising from his chair. Fin raises a hand to stop him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe went to the lake, said she had some meditation exercises to catch up on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well, I\u2019m gonna make sure to invite her next time then,\u201d he offers and makes his best attempt to mock-glare at Finn. \u201cAnd we <i>are</i> leaving her some.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should pack it up now before I get to it,\u201d Finn says with a smile, but he helps Poe transfer some of the food into a container with a soft smile. It\u2019s so incredibly inconvenient, to be honest.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s starting to plan the next meal menu already.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A large group of his pilots are in the rec room, huddled around a table. Pava\u2019s voice rises above everyone else, asking for some air so she can work in peace.</p>\n<p>He has a bad feeling about this. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks and is prompt ignored by everyone. Well, almost everyone. Finn, who has been obscured by the group before, raises his head from over a datapad. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re making a poster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe has started to smile at him, the action instinctual and ingrained by now, but at the explanation it turns into a frown. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Dameron,\u201d Jessika shouts out at him. \u201cShow me that pretty face, I need to see if I got your nose right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he tells her emphatically. \u201cNot again, Pava.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the last one was such a success, we\u2019ve had a seventeen percent increase in efficiency that week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrelation is not causation,\u201d he mutters and catches Finn\u2019s curious gaze before ducking his head, cheeks burning. He glances at the poster then, surveying Pava\u2019s work. </p>\n<p>In terms of artistic merit, it\u2019s not bad, she has serious talent. In terms of content, well. Fuck him. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s still better than the last one, but that\u2019s not saying much, because the last one had him in an open shirt and the line \u201cI need YOU to fight for the Resistance\u201d above his head. This time he\u2019s actually in his uniform, front and centre of the poster, his hair all tousled (and that\u2019s definitely more hair than he actually has, what the fuck, Pava). Behind him, half a squadron of X-wings flies in formation, making it seem like he has a halo or a crown. Block letters underneath tell the viewer to \u201cdo your part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hanging that up,\u201d he mutters, scratching at the back of his neck. He can feel Finn\u2019s gaze and he cannot even begin to fathom what he thinks of all of this. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, are you in charge of base decorations?\u201d Snap asks and he\u2019s clearly laughing into his hand, Poe can see it clearly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Finn says and Poe spins on his heel in time to see him shrug and offer a small smile. \u201cIt looks great, and a perfect likeness. You\u2019re really good,\u201d he tells Jessika earnestly and Poe cannot deal with this. Cannot start guessing at what does it exactly mean, is he just praising Jess\u2019 skills or does he include Poe\u2019s looks, and if he does, <i>what does he mean by it</i>.</p>\n<p>Honestly, he hasn\u2019t been this fucked since\u2026 he\u2019s never been this fucked. Something about Finn\u2019s earnestness, about his quick grins and his amazing resilience, something about <i>Finn</i> reduces him to this nervous, awkward mess, week knees and rapid pulse. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, Finn?\u201d Captain Sholt asks, coming to stand next to them. All of the pilots straighten up a little in her presence - she\u2019s recon, one of Madine\u2019s old commandos, and one of the most frighteningly competent people on base. They all busy themselves with conversation while Poe steps a little closer to Finn. \u201cI have a favour to ask. We have a young woman on base who helped us during our last assignment. She\u2019s a First Order defector and seems to be really scared and confused right now. We thought you might consider talking to her about what she might want to do next?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gestures to a faraway table where the woman is sitting, talking quietly to one of Sholt\u2019s men. She holds herself tightly, like a wound spring, like she might want to bolt any moment, her face carefully blank.</p>\n<p>Finn nods quickly, biting his lip. \u201cSure. Yeah, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes his way towards the woman, Poe staying behind but incapable of looking away from the scene. His hands itch, small shiver in his fingers. The woman is guarded when Finn sits down, leaning in a little. Poe doesn\u2019t hear what he says, but the woman\u2019s voice carries, shock clearly audible as she calls Finn by the series of numbers he\u2019s left behind. </p>\n<p>Poe digs his fingernails into his palms, quite probably leaving crescent indents in them. Finn gives a small shake of his head, his smile gentle when he says something quiet, making the woman relax minutely, shoulders no longer as rigid.</p>\n<p>Sholt nods at him and heads towards the table and Jessika moves to stand shoulder to shoulder with Poe. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do a second poster,\u201d she says thoughtfully. He gives her a look and she smiles back, reaching out to pat his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make you a copy,\u201d she tells him. Then she grins. \u201cYours is still going up. I might do a calendar.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Finn has been absorbing new skills like a sponge for the past few weeks, practically ever since he woke up and could move around the base. He told Poe a little about his First Order training and his Sanitation rotation, and on one hand it\u2019s quite clear that he has been wasted there, on the other Poe is pathetically grateful that Jakku was Finn\u2019s very first battle experience. </p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s their luck that the Order never quite realised Finn\u2019s potential. He picks things up with astonishing speed - Poe could see that on their very first TIE flight, when Finn went from confused about the controls to excellent aim the moment he understood them. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s still looking for his place in the Resistance, even though he\u2019s earned it a long time ago, and a part of it is training or working with every crew in turn. Last week it was hand to hand, even though both the med droids and Poe were wary about whether he wasn\u2019t rushing into it. This week it\u2019s X-wing repairs and maintenance and he\u2019s asked Snap to show him.</p>\n<p>Poe found out this morning, arriving to check up on his fighter and finding Finn working a couple of metres away, stripped down to his undershirt. </p>\n<p>Snap might be holding a grudge against him, he\u2019ll have to investigate that one. </p>\n<p>When asked why he didn\u2019t turn to Poe if he wanted X-wing experience, Finn told him he didn\u2019t want to bother him, which is the most ridiculous thing Poe has heard, and he\u2019s heard Pava\u2019s jokes after she had a couple of drinks. </p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s laughter reaches him from Snap\u2019s fighter and the wrench slips out of Poe\u2019s hand and falls on his foot. </p>\n<p>BB-8 extends it\u2019s pinchers and picks it up delicately, waving it at Poe pointedly, asking if he\u2019s alright. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, buddy,\u201d he assures the droids and sighs, running his hand over his face, probably leaving smudges of sooth and oil. \u201cJust losing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it, you\u2019ve lost it a long time ago, Dameron,\u201d Kare tells him, leaning against the side of his fighter. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook what the mynock dragged in,\u201d he laughs, jumping down the ladder and moving to hug her. Her squadron has been on a mission in the Outer Rim for the past month and he has been starting to worry. He doesn\u2019t say that out loud, she would probably kick him. \u201cBack for good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends on General\u2019s orders, but back for now. Need to give my guys a rest, spend some time on repairs and, most importantly, catch up on giving you hard time. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve been having all the fun and leaving nothing for the rest of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know, just the usual. Found the map to Skywalker, got captured by the Order, tortured just that little bit, escaped, shot some TIEs and, what was it, oh right. Helped destroy a giant murder planet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the fun,\u201d she repeats, giving him a one-armed hug. \u201cHey, how is my favourite droid?\u201d she asks BB-8, who overdoes on honesty and proceeds to tell her that he\u2019s a little worried about Poe, because his vitals keep fluctuating.</p>\n<p>That droid is a menace. </p>\n<p>Kare opens her mouth to say something, but is interrupted by Finn\u2019s approach, as he\u2019s shrugging into Poe\u2019s jacket on his way. Kare\u2019s eyes grow wide as she recognises the jacket and she gives Poe a shrewd look he doesn\u2019t like in the slightest. </p>\n<p>BB-8 produces the shrill beep that translates to \u201cI told you so\u201d and asks if Poe is sick. Finn glances up at him with some concern - he\u2019s been learning binary too, and apparently it paid off. Poe would be proud if he wasn\u2019t so mortified at the moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Finn asks with concern and Poe nods quickly, determined to change the subject. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d he asks, pointing to Snap\u2019s fighter with his chin. Finn shrugs with a small, shy smile that has quickly become one of Poe\u2019s favourites. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood, I think. Snap says I\u2019m not entirely incompetent. Yeah, so I\u2019m not quite sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe sends Wexley a pointed glare, which he ignores, and shakes his head at Finn. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the highest praises coming from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Kare supplies, nodding. \u201cThere was this one time, back when we were with the Republic\u2026 There\u2019s this famous sim exercise everyone tries over and over again, the second Death Star run? Based on Antilles\u2019 flight data, it\u2019s crazy hard and you basically die if you miss his route by half a metre or a second. Then this guy,\u201d she points her thumb at Poe with a shit-eating grin, \u201cdecides that he\u2019s gonna go off book and shoot down every single TIE there, because that\u2019s what he does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen that,\u201d Finn agrees, glancing at Poe with a widening grin. Poe literally cannot look at him right now, not when there\u2019s something akin to awe in Finn\u2019s eyes and not when his grin is this blinding. \u201cHe definitely does that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe looks down at his shoes, raising his hand to the back of his neck, scratching the sudden itch there. </p>\n<p>He can hear the grin in Kare\u2019s voice when she continues with the story. \u201cRacked up the highest score on the sim, completely ruined it for the rest of us because no one has been able to beat him ever since. Anyway, he gets out of the simulator and Snap\u2019s there, looking at the scores, and he shrugs at Poe and goes, \u2018well, you didn\u2019t fuck it up.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe can feel his cheeks burning. He glances up at Finn, who\u2019s staring at him with this strange expression, not just awe but something softer, kinder, and he needs to get out of here immediately, needs to do something that\u2019s not kissing Finn, needs to get himself under control and squared away. </p>\n<p>Against his better judgement he reaches out and pats Finn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPoint is, if Wexley says you\u2019re not entirely incompetent, he means that you might be the third person in the galaxy he\u2019s gonna let do repairs on his ship. The other one, by the way, is his wife, and we\u2019re pretty sure that half of the reason he married her are her repair skills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like thirty percent,\u201d Snap volunteers from where he\u2019s meticulously sorting his tools according to whatever system he came up with this week. \u201cTwenty percent is her skill with a blaster, because damn that woman can shoot, and the rest is for me to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe rolls his eyes; they\u2019ve all been treated to a number of spiels on all the reasons Snaps\u2019 wife is the greatest person to ever live in the galaxy every time Wexley is drunk. Or every time they\u2019ve been holed up on a recon mission and bored out of their minds. Or just whenever she happens to appear in his line of vision. </p>\n<p>He glances at Finn and realises his hand is still on his shoulder. He takes it back, his fingers twitching a little. \u201cSo anyway, sound seal of approval. But if you ever feel like some practice, you\u2019re welcome to help me with this,\u201d he waves his hand at his X-wing and ignores Kare\u2019s raised eyebrow. He knows what she\u2019s thinking, but he\u2019s not as bad as Snap, he\u2019s perfectly fine with allowing the maintenance crew to do their job.</p>\n<p>He does occasionally check in after they\u2019re done to recalibrate and tweak a couple of things, but that\u2019s just because he\u2019s a little set in his ways and they always calibrate to standard settings. Which is fine, he deals with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds great, thanks,\u201d Finn grins at him again and steps back, bumping into BB-8 slightly and placing his hand on the droid\u2019s head in apology. BB-8 makes a pleased noise under his touch and Poe honestly shouldn\u2019t be jealous, what the fuck. \u201cWe still for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, let me know when Rey gets back and I\u2019ll bring the food,\u201d he nods and offers a small wave when Finn turns to leave, and then stands there like an idiot with his hand raised for a couple beats too long.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Dameron,\u201d Kare says, finally laughing after she has probably strained something trying to restrain herself. Finn turns back briefly at the sound before continuing to walk towards the living quarters. \u201cI love you,\u201d she says, shaking her head and reaching out to ruffle his hair affectionately, \u201cbut you\u2019re so fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember the time I was your commanding officer and could write you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVaguely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat times,\u201d he says wistfully and she rolls her eyes at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she mutters, pulling on his sleeve. \u201cYou need to tell me everything about him, and don\u2019t lie to me, I can tell you really want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is gonna take a while. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rey says, dropping down to Finn\u2019s bed and kicking his thigh to get more comfortable. BB-8 rolls into the room after her, swaying by her side. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Finn tells her earnestly. \u201cWhat are we figuring out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Poe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn glances at BB-8 briefly, but the droid just dims one of its lights for a moment, and Finn isn\u2019t quite sure how to take that. Is it winking? What does it even mean?</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to take a crack at something else first? Peace in the galaxy? Instilling tact in Threepio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Luke didn\u2019t manage, how can I, a mere apprentice,\u201d she says lightly and pokes him in his side, and he yelps in response, because as they\u2019ve unfortunately discovered, he is amazingly ticklish, it\u2019s unfair. \u201cYou have been moping this past week and don\u2019t lie to me, there\u2019s no point in lying to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this the Force thing, or is it about that time I said I was in the Resistance?\u201d he asks suspiciously. </p>\n<p>BB-8 makes a noise that sounds suspiciously like laughter and doesn\u2019t resemble any of the words he knows in binary. \u201cShush, you,\u201d he tells it good-naturedly. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018you\u2019ve been moping for the past week and I\u2019m done watching this\u2019 thing,\u201d she tells him and pats his knee. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided you need help,\u201d she says and BB-8 hums in agreement. </p>\n<p>Great, so even the droid has had enough of watching him trail after Poe and be pathetic. \u201cI cannot deal with this, Rey. Have you seen him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d she nods, mouth pulled up in a smile she\u2019s clearly trying to hold back. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have any pillows within reach to toss at her. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy,\u201d she offers consolingly and it startles a laugh out of Finn.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? I mean, I could have missed that. This week he\u2019s only cooked me the best dinner I\u2019ve ever had, and then topped that with an even better one, had people on base make posters immortalising his greatness, and hang out with the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen. Present company excepted,\u201d he adds and Rey rolls her eyes at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pilot with the legs and the hair?\u201d she asks, nodding. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve seen her, that was a pretty accurate assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s no way I have a chance with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>BB-8 proceeds to beep rapidly at him and Finn\u2019s not yet fluent enough to understand binary beyond a couple of words, and they don\u2019t make a lot of sense. He glances at Rey pleadingly as she starts laughing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBB-8 says that while your report of this week\u2019s events is factually accurate, you were not a witness to that time Poe dropped a wrench on his foot because you smiled.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares at BB-8 for a long moment, uncomprehending. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>BB-8\u2019s head slides to the side, surveying him expectantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but what?\u201d</p>\n<p>What the explanation amounts to, apparently, is that he has more than a chance. BB-8 offers to calculate the odds for him, and then instead of giving him the actual odds, it repeats the little thumbs-up gesture and beeps encouragingly. </p>\n<p>Well, if there\u2019s a chance, there\u2019s no way in hell Finn is gonna be the idiot who throws it away.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Rey sends an apology message about missing dinner through BB-8. Poe worries briefly about whether something has happened, but he sees Skywalker talking with General Organa, and the Jedi Master nods at him pleasantly and doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a crisis brewing other than the usual.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just him and Finn then, like those first days after the Starkiller base\u2019s destruction, except then he was only beginning to suspect how head over heels he has truly fallen.</p>\n<p>Now he\u2019s looking forward to the dinner with a mix of excitement and trepidation, the nervousness brought up to the surface because he\u2019s spent the past few hours being grilled by Kare about his feelings for Finn. That woman is relentless and he needs to make sure she spends as much time away from Pava as possible. </p>\n<p>Kare\u2019s advice was to \u201cjust tell him,\u201d which is great and all, and his absolute normal go-to tactic except this is <i>Finn</i>. The man who has saved him on the worst day of his life, and the man who has heard all of his Rogue Squadron stories at least twice and still laughed at them. The man so unaware of the effect he has on people on base, and even more seemingly unaware of the effect he has on Poe. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Finn says, knuckles rapping on the half-open door as he pokes his head in. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, Rey was needed somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves at Finn to come in. \u201cI know, she\u2019s left a message with BB-8.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see how it is,\u201d Finn nods, sliding into his usual seat. \u201cShe didn\u2019t trust me to tell you, I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, either you or BB-8,\u201d Poe tells him and chuckles at the absolutely offended sound from over where BB-8 has plugged in to the holonet. \u201cSeems like it\u2019s you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d Finn leans back in his chair, watching as Poe transfers the noodles onto plates. Poe can feel his gaze on the back of his neck and forces his hands to stay steady, tries not to fluster visibly. It\u2019s mostly a losing battle and he kind of hates those. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s something different about Finn\u2019s face when he looks at him, his gaze unflinching, searching. Poe sits down and fills their glasses and has to duck his head under the scrutiny. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks when he trusts himself to look up again. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking,\u201d Finn starts, pausing like he\u2019s looking for words.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Rey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd BB-8, mostly,\u201d he nods towards the droid who makes a noncommittal acknowledging sound. Poe reaches for his water, downing half of the glass. This doesn\u2019t bode well, nothing bodes well when BB-8 attempts nonchalance. </p>\n<p>\u201cAbout?\u201d he asks, his voice resembling a croak more than anything else.</p>\n<p>Finn shrugs, his eyes never leaving Poe\u2019s. \u201cYou know I like you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Warmth explodes in Poe\u2019s chest at the same time as his stomach turns, and he pushes down on both feelings, pushes down on the light and heady sensation bubbling up to the surface, something akin to hope. \u201cI know, you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn gives a slight shake of his head. \u201cNot quite what I meant. Should I have followed it with, I really want to kiss you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Who says things like that? Who leaves themselves so open, so vulnerable, who can be so brave and reckless with their heart?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay? You went a little red\u2026\u201d Finn starts and doesn\u2019t finish, Poe\u2019s chair screeching against the floor before tipping over, and Poe is standing up, moving, fingers itching before they tangle in Finn\u2019s shirt, his lips dry before they touch Finn\u2019s, his breathing stopped until they\u2019re sharing it. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good, I thought I was going to fuck it up,\u201d Finn mutters against his lips and Poe would laugh but he\u2019s too busy kissing him again.</p>"
