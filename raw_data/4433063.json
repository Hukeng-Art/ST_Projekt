If it\u2019s going as well as you think it is, then go out again.\u00a0 If you\u2019re really that thirsty for it, pull him into the bathroom and get him to blow you.\u00a0 You won\u2019t have to take him back to your place or take off your jacket, but only if you have a condom on you.\u00a0 Safe sex is good sex.\u00a0 I know you\u2019re a teenager and all, but remember that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t just pull him into the bathroom\u2026\u201d Steve answered in a scandalized tone.\u00a0 He felt a bit foolish, crouched protectively over the receiver of the pay phone as wait staff walked by him to get in and out of the kitchen.\u00a0 \u201cCan I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough.\u00a0 Just tell him you\u2019re going to the bathroom and hint that he should join you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contrary to belief, Steve had fooled around in a bathroom before, he just typically did it with people he was in a relationship with.\u00a0 Someone he wouldn\u2019t call the next morning?\u00a0 A little more terrifying. \u201cI already used the bathroom excuse to call you.\u00a0 Or, well\u2026 you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guy was silent for a moment, and Steve thought it was possible he was being laughed at.\u00a0 Steve didn\u2019t blame the guy.\u00a0 \u201cThere are other places you can hook up.\u00a0 Try an alley or the back of a cab.\u201d\u00a0 He could hear a muffled \u2018sorry\u2019 before the guy said, \u201cI was told by this very nice cab driver to tell you not to use the back of a cab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the kind of guy to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve could practically hear the shrug.\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re not an exhibitionist, but you\u2019re the kind of guy who is considering putting out on the first date. If all you want from him is sex, then fucking <em>get it</em>.\u00a0 If not, get a second date and be more prepared next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve took a deep breath, and he couldn\u2019t quite believe he was about to take advice from a stranger. \u00a0Steve didn\u2019t always take good advice from his <em>friends</em>. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u00a0 Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem.\u00a0 And, and hey! One last thing: <em>for fucksakes, call a plumber</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve laughed and hung up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Really, that should have been the first and last time he heard the stranger\u2019s voice on the other end of the phone.\u00a0 It should have been.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve was experiencing deja vu as he grabbed the cordless phone off the table in the hallway and ducked into the washroom.\u00a0 The number he dialed almost rang out before someone answered with a half-formed word that could have been \u2018hello\u2019 or any other variation of acknowledgment. \u201cSam! I think my coworker is trying to set me up with her nineteen year old daughter.\u00a0 She told me the entire department would be at her house, but it\u2019s just the three of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was silence on the other end of the line.\u00a0 A familiar kind of silence that made Steve want to hit his head against the sink because <em>again?</em> He hadn\u2019t called Sam.\u00a0 Sam would already be laughing at Steve, because he knew Steve and Steve\u2019s dating luck, but this kind of weighted silence was the kind that said things were about to get awkward.\u00a0 \u201cIs she attractive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve let out the breath he was holding.\u00a0 At least he was consistently dialing the wrong number instead of unloading his dating woes on multiple strangers.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I think the point is that you\u2019re missing it.\u00a0 She\u2019s not trying to set you up with her kid, she\u2019s trying to get you for herself.\u00a0 Are <em>you</em> attractive?\u00a0 I feel like you might be attractive if this is happening to you, but maybe not because you have no idea how to spot someone throwing themselves at you.\u00a0 That\u2019s a thing that gets old and obvious really fast.\u00a0 That\u2019s irrelevant, sorry, sorry.\u00a0 I\u2019m a little tipsy.\u00a0 Ignore me.\u00a0 The point is, she\u2019s wants you in her bed and made sure there was easy access.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, babe, she wants in your pants the same way you wanted in that guy\u2019s pants last month, and believe me, she\u2019s more prepared than you were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 what?\u00a0 No\u2026 what do I do?\u201d he hissed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, get off the house phone.\u00a0 They\u2019re probably both listening in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2026?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did I know?\u00a0 You\u2019d have Sam\u2019s number on your own phone, so you\u2019re not using it.\u00a0 I bet you\u2019re pretending to hide in the bathroom again, which is such a patent move for you it\u2019s ironic considering how you treat your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! I called a plumber.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>fantastic</em>,\u201d the guy answered in a dry, sarcastic tone that immediately made Steve like him more.\u00a0 \u201cLook, get off the phone, sit through the food like an adult, and then excuse yourself because you have a date later tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god.\u201d Steve was being laughed at again. \u201cAre you telling me you can\u2019t lie?\u00a0 Ok, fine.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be at Tip Top until about 10 tonight.\u00a0 Come meet me.\u00a0 If you\u2019re exhausted by the time supper is over, just don\u2019t show up.\u00a0 That easy.\u00a0 Now go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t bother correcting the guy, because he could lie.\u00a0 He could lie decently well if he had an actual lie in place, and even if the stranger on the phone didn\u2019t realize it, he\u2019d given Steve what he needed.\u00a0 The problem Steve had with lying was when he was put on the spot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he had plans later.\u00a0 With <em>stranger on the phone</em>.\u00a0 His good pal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could get through this, he thought, hanging up without saying goodbye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was lounging in bed by nine, staring up at his ceiling with the hopes that maybe a blank canvas could help him piece together exactly what had just happened.\u00a0 It had been a weird night.\u00a0 Such a weird night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kind of wanted to tell his good pal, <em>stranger on the phone</em> about it, because if anyone could understand the ridiculousness of it, it was him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said, recognising the guy\u2019s voice saying hello this time.\u00a0 He knew that the guy had a local number, he\u2019d just accidentally inverted the last two numbers in Sam\u2019s phone number.\u00a0 Twice.\u00a0 It was easy enough to figure out now that he could consult his contact list.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 I left Tip Top hours ago.\u00a0 Completely forgot about our date.\u201d\u00a0 Steve could no longer hear the sounds of the bar in the background, but there was clearly laughter coming from close by.\u00a0 It took him a moment to place that it was from a television rather than people.\u00a0 He knew, if the guy was listening, it would be obvious by the ambient noise that he wasn\u2019t in public either.\u00a0 If this stranger had figured out he was on a house phone, surely he\u2019s already figured out he hadn\u2019t accidentally stood Steve up. \u201cBy the sounds of it, you\u2019re not looking for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it.\u00a0 I know you didn\u2019t actually mean for me to meet you.\u00a0 I just thought you\u2019d be interested to know that you were right about the mom, but wrong about the daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guy was silent for a moment.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d he questioned, his tone clearly amused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe ran her foot up my leg at one point during dessert.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait? The daughter or the mom?\u201d he asked, a laugh burbling out of his mouth.\u00a0 It sounded bright and amused, for all that it was at Steve\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe daughter,\u201d Steve smiled, enjoying the story for its storytelling, or more likely, enjoying the response he was getting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u00a0 How attractive are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it.\u00a0 There was some kind of rivalry there and I ran out pretty quickly after food, so now I\u2019m wondering if I can even go back to work.\u00a0 I might have to quit my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a damn drama queen,\u201d the man laughed.\u00a0 \u201cUnless she\u2019s your boss.\u00a0 Then yes.\u00a0 Quit your job.\u00a0 But only if you have a back up and running away is your forte.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Steve mused, staring at his ceiling and wondering what he was doing with his life.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m being dramatic.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to quit my job.\u00a0 I might have to bring a date to the company function, but quitting is excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have a problem with that,\u201d the man sounded like he was laughing at Steve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fact that Steve hadn\u2019t been in a relationship for over a year begged to differ.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t know this about me, and I know these conversations haven\u2019t been a very good sampling of my personality, but I\u2019m not the type of person to quit just because it\u2019s tough going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a quitter, huh? So what happened to that guy you wanted to fuck?\u00a0 Were back alley blowjobs involved?\u00a0 Second dates?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Steve mused.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly quitting.\u00a0 I considered both of those, but he didn\u2019t tip the waitress.\u00a0 It ruined my boner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve agreed.\u00a0 \u201cThanks for talking this out with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said with amusement.\u00a0 \u201cName\u2019s Bucky by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Steve, I have mediocre Chinese take-out to finish while I\u2019m still tipsy enough to think it\u2019s tasty, so I\u2019m going to let you go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Steve answered.\u00a0 \u201cBye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanging up was a little awkward, but then so was the entire conversation.\u00a0 Steve programmed Bucky\u2019s number into his phone, wondering if it was a weird thing to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It <em>was</em> a weird thing to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever, though, it couldn\u2019t be weirder than repeatedly calling a guy for dating advice while hiding in the washroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Friday night!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you have a dating emergency I might not hear the phone</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dance club tonight</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Maybe you could text me from under the table like a normal 28 yr old on a date.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At one point, all Steve texted back was <em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! things got weird.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I feel like I\u2019m missing premium gossip.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Callll meeee</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>x.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a bit chilly out, but Steve liked the crisp feel of the autumn air.\u00a0 It helped him decompress from his date, and there was something about the damp, cool smell of autumn that appealed to him.\u00a0 It reminded him of leaves crunching beneath his feet, warm apple cider, and the excitement of preparing for Halloween.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was walking on a sidewalk that saw a lot of foot traffic over the run of a day, so there weren\u2019t very many leaves for his foot to scrape against, but he did wonder if he could find apple cider at the Farmer\u2019s Market.\u00a0 He\u2019d go in the morning, and detour across the park so he could take a moment to look at the leaves changing colour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thoughts and plans helped him cool down enough, so after a few blocks of walking with his thoughts, all he really wanted to do was tell Bucky.\u00a0 Bucky had said \u2018premium gossip\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t quite that.\u00a0 It was something best shared, though, and it felt weird that the first person he wanted to share it with wasn\u2019t Sam.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Steve said with no preamble once Bucky picked up the phone with an exclaimed \u2018Steve!\u2019.\u00a0 \u201cAre you ready to hear about my most recent dating misadventure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bucky answered him back in a yell.\u00a0 There was incredibly loud dance music behind him, and Steve had no idea how Bucky could even hear him.\u00a0 Maybe he just had good ears for hearing people while in a club. Steve had trouble with that so it was kind of baffling to him. \u201cAre you hiding in the bathroom like dating is some kind of horror movie scenario?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDating isn\u2019t, but this might be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There went the theory of Bucky being able to hear him. \u201cDating isn\u2019t a horror movie but this date might be,\u201d Steve answered a bit louder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might be what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA horror movie!\u201d\u00a0 Steve yelled into the phone, wincing in apology as a couple on the sidewalk gave him wide berth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you! Give me a moment,\u201d Bucky answered, and Steve could hear him moving through a crowd, the sounds of music and people more prevalent than Bucky himself.\u00a0 Steve would think it strange that Bucky always seemed to be out when he called if Steve didn\u2019t consistently call him on Friday nights.\u00a0 \u201cShit, it\u2019s gotten cooler out,\u201d Bucky said, and Steve could hear that he\u2019d broken from the crowd.\u00a0 The cacophony of the background seemed to become suddenly quiet, a stillness that carried over the phone line.\u00a0 \u201cBetter make this quick, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only October,\u201d Steve reminded him.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s brisk.\u00a0 You told me to call.\u201d\u00a0 Steve had opted to walk the fifteen blocks home rather than take public transit.\u00a0 It had given him perspective, and that perspective was that other people should appreciate Brooklyn in the fall. \u00a0\"Enjoy it. \u00a0Breathe it in.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, I'm standing next to a dumpster. \u00a0I just came from a sweaty club and this shirt is thin.\u00a0 I wanted people to see my chest through it, but these nips are not what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve laughed in response.\u00a0 The difficulty with having never met Bucky was that Steve couldn\u2019t get a mental picture of that.\u00a0 Oh, he could think of a random faceless body wearing a thin white shirt, but he didn\u2019t know what color Bucky\u2019s chest hair would be, or if he even had any at all, and he didn\u2019t know Bucky\u2019s size.\u00a0 Bucky could be anyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone in Steve\u2019s area code who spent time in a bar in Bed-Stuy.\u00a0 That did not narrow it down as much as someone might think.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell if you\u2019re just going to complain, would you rather hear the story or go back inside?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m out here already,\u201d Bucky grumbled.\u00a0 \u201cBut this better be good.\u00a0 You\u2019re making me regret that I quit smoking.\u00a0 There\u2019s this guy about four feet away taunting me with his cigarette. \u2013 <em>No, I don\u2019t want to fight you for it</em>, Jesus Christ, ok, hold on I have to move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve listened, half with amusement and half in concern as Bucky grumbled as he walked, complaining about drunk people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, Steve, this better be a good story.\u00a0 I\u2019m freezing my balls off, here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s a sign your pants are too tight.\u201d\u00a0 That was something Steve knew from experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t think so if you saw my ass in them,\u201d Bucky retorted.\u00a0 \u201cNow tell me your weird dating story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It probably wasn\u2019t that good of a story, but somehow that made the situation even funnier.\u00a0 \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see how weird it is.\u00a0 So the date was going ok.\u00a0 The guy was a little strange, insisting to get my chair for me and offering to ask the hostess if I could keep the flowers on the table if I thought they were pretty, but nothing alarming.\u00a0 In the right context it could be kind of sweet, in that way that people who don\u2019t really understand how to talk to someone smoothly can be when they\u2019re trying too hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d Bucky drawled in response, blowing out a puff of air that crackled over the phone.\u00a0 \u201cUsually I think overly desperate people are a turn-off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, while I feel like I might disagree with you in principle, this is one case where you\u2019re right.\u00a0 So, supper is going ok.\u00a0 Nothing weird happens, it\u2019s not like he tries to dictate my food choices or order for me, or any of those annoying alpha male moves that are incredibly telling about someone\u2019s personality.\u00a0 So the food comes and we\u2019re eating and talking, and it\u2019s starting to get pleasant when he leans across the table, looks into my eyes, and says\u2026\u201d Steve paused for dramatic effect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky questioned.\u00a0 He was definitely hooked on the story.\u00a0 Steve wasn\u2019t a very effective storyteller, so he wasn\u2019t sure why Bucky was so invested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says: I wish I could get you pregnant so you\u2019d have to stay with me forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky was silent for a moment before Steve could hear him inhale sharply over the phone.\u00a0 \u201c<em>What?</em>\u00a0 What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky wasn\u2019t laughing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were a lot of things about Bucky that Steve liked in a \u2018strangers who nod at each other on the train\u2019 kind of way.\u00a0 There were a few things about Bucky that Steve felt like he could even appreciate on a deeper level.\u00a0 This was the first time he actively <em>liked</em> the person Bucky was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean. What. The. Fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI KNOW,\u201d Steve answered.\u00a0 \u201cSo I said: \u2018that\u2019s creepy and invasive someone\u2019s bodily autonomy and not something anyone wants to hear, no matter their gender. I suggest you reconsider the way you speak to people. I\u2019m going to the bathroom now and I\u2019m not coming back\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u00a0 What the actual fuck?\u201d Bucky repeated.\u00a0 \u201cI feel like I should be laughing, like it\u2019s so horrifying it\u2019s funny, but instead I\u2019m just standing here like a ridiculous asshole with my mouth open in shock.\u00a0 Who the hell says something like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve smiled.\u00a0 Yes, he did like Bucky more now that he told the story.\u00a0 Possibly he\u2019d used it as some kind of test, but he\u2019d never admit to it.\u00a0 \u201cI told you it was weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got hit on three times, and then decided to just come home,\u201d Steve told Bucky, picking at the shawarma he\u2019d picked up a few blocks over.\u00a0 He licked his fingers and wondered if he could have apple cider with this.\u00a0 It would be a weird combination, but apples went with a lot of things Steve wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider a good match.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t find any of them attractive?\u201d Bucky questioned idly.\u00a0 He told Steve that he\u2019d just gotten back from a work trip and didn\u2019t have the energy for more than a nap and maybe some internet porn later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEh,\u201d Steve answered.\u00a0 \u201cThey were ok.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why they approached me, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAttractive people are kind of my thing,\u201d Bucky drawled in a lazy tone.\u00a0 \u201cThree people wouldn\u2019t approach you unless you had something going on.\u00a0 Believe me, I\u2019m a connoisseur.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself that attractive,\u201d Steve told him.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like being judged by my looks from across a bar, like I'm some kind of prey.\u00a0 Every time it happens I turn down the offer on the principle of the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, you just said two contradictory things to me.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t get offers if you weren\u2019t moderately attractive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no accounting for the taste of drunk people,\u201d Steve answered. \u00a0\"It leaves me feeling kind of cold to be considered based on how I look and not,\u201d Steve hesitated, sure Bucky would laugh at him.\u00a0 \u201cMe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand, but look, even that guy you didn\u2019t go home with would have taken one look at you in the beginning of the date and sized you up.\u00a0 You did the same for him.\u00a0 Everyone does it.\u00a0 There\u2019s something more honest about a stranger in a bar coming up to you with the sole purpose of sex.\u00a0 Both of you know what cards are on the table, you\u2019re not trying to impress him, or her, by giving little pieces of yourself that are both personal and yet something you judge as not being personal enough that you can\u2019t tell a stranger.\u00a0 There\u2019s something unfussy about the \u2018you\u2019re hot, if you think I\u2019m hot and down for it, we should fuck\u2019 convo.\u00a0 Something almost pure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething almost pure,\u201d Steve repeated slowly, holding the phone between his chin and his shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d he continued with a laugh.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s say I do see your point, but I think there\u2019s something really defeatist about it.\u00a0 It might be honest, but it sucks the romance right out of equation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky answered him with an impatient whine.\u00a0 \u201cOf course it does.\u00a0 We\u2019re not talking romance, here, unless you need romance to be present in order to fuck.\u00a0 Which is, you know, a thing I\u2019m aware exists \u2013 just not our current topic here.\u00a0 Unless it is.\u00a0 We\u2019re just talking straightforward sexual attraction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 It seems cold.\u00a0 I prefer spending an hour across from someone and weighing whether I can stand them for any longer than that.\u00a0 I like to know who I\u2019m taking to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou almost ended up bringing home someone who doesn\u2019t tip wait-staff.\u201d\u00a0 Bucky sounded amused as he reminded Steve of this little gem.\u00a0 His tone emphasized it like not tipping was a grievous offense, up there with cannibalism.\u00a0 Bucky had agreed that it was terrible when Steve first mentioned it, but now he was using it to make fun of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Steve really liked that about Bucky, in the growing list of things he liked about Bucky.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky continued. \u201cAt least when you don\u2019t know the person\u2019s name, you can\u2019t be held accountable for people <em>who don\u2019t tip</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen was the last time you went on a date?\u201d Steve questioned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen was the last time you hooked up with a stranger?\u201d Bucky countered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFive years ago in college.\u00a0 Your turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDating is for people who are worried about being alone for the rest of their lives. Are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re evading the question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m leaving now. Goodbye, Steve,\u201d Bucky said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>How about a challenge.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I will date someone if you try a one night stand.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes when he looked at the texts.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Turned out he could back down from a dare.\u00a0 <em>I don\u2019t back down from challenges but I\u2019ll have to decline.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*chicken* *poop* *happy face*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*eggplant* *eggplant* *heart* *bride* *baby bottle*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Or your last date: *baby bottle* *stop light*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*poop*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*poop*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from

Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*poop*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>OK FINE YOU\u2019RE ON!</em> Steve texted Bucky back, amazed that a few emoticons had the ability to aggravate him into doing this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>New text from Bucky:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>*smirk face*</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t give Bucky\u2019s dare much thought except to berate himself over being annoyed into taking it.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t really considered that he might go through with it until he spotted the guy leaning back against the bar, long, strong legs in a pair of tight black denim.\u00a0 His leather jacket was open, and he looked casual about the fact he was perusing the bar to assess who he\u2019d like to approach with an offer or a flirty line.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t desperate in it, and while there was something detached about the efforts, Steve could appreciate someone who knew what they wanted and actively went for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In other words, the type of person Steve had always had a curious kind of attraction to; the intense, temporary kind that was based entirely off of looks rather than mutual interests or intellect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to be just <em>anyone</em>, but he liked the idea of being chosen for a night by someone who looked discerning enough to leave if no one caught their eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe.\u00a0 Maybe, he thought, he might go through with Bucky\u2019s challenge after all.\u00a0 His eyes immediately took in the man\u2019s hands, the way he was holding his beer bottle loosely in his fingers like he was completely unconcerned by the potential of dropping it, and felt a thrill at that kind of practiced control.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yeah, maybe he could do this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em>wanted</em> to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man finally noticed Steve watching him, and he bit his lip as he took a moment to assess Steve back.\u00a0 He tilted his head to the side and gave Steve a smile, the first reaction Steve had seen from him in the five minutes he\u2019d been watching.\u00a0 He finished his drink and licked his mouth, standing and leaving behind the bottle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve found that his heart was beating incredibly quickly.\u00a0 He was nervous and aroused.\u00a0 This was it.\u00a0 He would either be able to do this or he wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few moments later Steve realized that he\u2019d lost sight of the man on the dance floor, and he wondered if that was some kind of social cue he didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 Was he supposed to get up and go meet him somewhere, some kind of unspoken rule people who did this regularly understood?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was about to get up to explore that possibility when his phone rang.\u00a0 He pulled it out of his pocket, thinking it might be Sam cancelling on him, but the incoming call was from Bucky.\u00a0 Bucky never initiated phone calls, only texts, so even though Steve didn\u2019t think this was a great time, he answered anyway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve answered, deciding he\u2019d find out what the call was about before he told Bucky he might be busy.\u00a0 If Bucky was actually taking his own challenge seriously, the call could be about any number of things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do you do when the most attractive man you\u2019ve ever seen, like seriously gorgeous Steve, you\u2019d consider it too if you saw him, is giving you eyes like he wants to take you to bed?\u00a0 How do you do this?\u00a0 Do I go over and talk to him and ask if he wants to get food?\u00a0 Food\u2019s a thing people do on dates, right?\u00a0 Or maybe I should just\u2026 try the dating thing later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your call.\u201d Steve answered.\u00a0 \u201cCan you see him now?\u00a0 What\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bucky said.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m tired of this.\u00a0 My eyes always go to the most beautiful person in the room, and I\u2019m exhausted of there being absolutely no meaning behind the hook ups.\u00a0 I know I challenged you, but I was really challenging myself.\u00a0 Why can\u2019t I meet someone who cares whether I tip the waitress?\u00a0 I\u2019ve been wondering about it for weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve couldn\u2019t help but smile, even though Bucky was genuinely worried.\u00a0 \u201cHow do you know that you don\u2019t?\u00a0 Do you ever ask?\u00a0 A lot of people feel really strongly about that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Bucky answered him, sounding exasperated.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not about that, specifically.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be alone for the rest of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hiding in the washroom?\u201d Steve asked, incredulously, trying not to laugh at the complete role reversal of Bucky calling him, freaking out about dating from the men\u2019s room.\u00a0 \u201cBucky, just go ask.\u00a0 If you want something more, find someone who\u2019s interested in the same things.\u00a0 If the gorgeous guy isn\u2019t, that\u2019s his problem.\u00a0 There will be someone you\u2019re attracted to who is.\u00a0 That\u2019s what dating is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u00a0 I think I\u2019m about to have a one night stand.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see how unfulfilled I feel in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Bucky answered in a serious tone.\u00a0 \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to\u2026 don\u2019t let me project my insecurities on you.\u00a0 I rescind the challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I appreciate the thought, you\u2019re not the only one who saw something they want tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky let out a bark of laughter, but he also sounded relieved.\u00a0 \u201cDirty, tell me the details later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about it in too much detail if you just suck it up and go try connecting emotionally to someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, ok, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve hung up the phone and wondered if his conversation with Bucky had made him lose his window entirely.\u00a0 He was about to get up and do something completely out of character, because if Bucky could do it, so could he, when the striking guy from the bar slid into the seat across from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve stared at him in surprise for a moment, wondering if maybe he\u2019d waited for Steve to get off the phone, though he hadn\u2019t noticed him in the surrounding area while talking to Bucky, and it seemed kind of ludicrous to think that someone with as much going on for him as this guy did would wait for Steve.\u00a0 The timing was too coincidental for it to be anything but.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts on the separation of religion and state?\u201d\u00a0 He asked in a confrontational tone, a sullen expression on his face, like he had very low expectations but high hopes for Steve\u2019s answer.\u00a0 There was something about the situation that had nothing to do with the man\u2019s sinful lips that made Steve hesitate before answering.\u00a0 Or, well, it had a lot to do with his mouth.\u00a0 It took Steve a moment, too distracted by the pout and the challenging stare, to place the voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he started laughing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky did not look happy that he was being laughed at, which made the situation so much funnier.\u00a0 He gave Steve a dirty expression before getting to his feet.\u00a0 \u201cFigures,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky, no,\u201d Steve appealed in the most somber tone he could muster, and then broke into laughter again as Bucky frowned at him in confusion before his eyes widened drastically and he sat heavily in the chair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky still did not find everything as funny as Steve did if his scowl was any indication.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked, multiple times I asked,\u201d he pointed out, eyebrows dour.\u00a0 \u201cJust how attractive you were, for fucksakes, Steve! \u00a0You modest asshole. I went through all that just to find out it\u2019s you, and you don\u2019t count.\u00a0 I <em>know </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Steve answered, because it was starting to occur to him exactly what Bucky had used as an opener. \u00a0<em>Jesus Christ, Bucky</em>. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t start with the heavy questions.\u00a0 And you don\u2019t act like you\u2019re going to fight someone depending on their answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Bucky demanded, tapping his fingers on the bar.\u00a0 \u201cThose are the kinds of things that matter.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to find out three months into a relationship that someone is a Republican.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019d figure it out before then.\u00a0 There are subtle clues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky rolled his eyes and continued pouting. Fuck, he was so gorgeous.\u00a0 That, more than anything, pulled Steve out of the hilarity of the situation.\u00a0 Steve wanted to bang him like a screen door and then carry him over the threshold. Was that weird?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was kind of weird.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least he hadn\u2019t said it out loud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky continued to look like life had betrayed him.\u00a0 \u201cHow would you do it, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to go out for supper sometime and see,\u201d Steve responded, deliberately pitching his tone as low and intimate as he could.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky grinned.\u00a0 \u201cOk, so your game is different from what I\u2019m used to, but you still have it.\u00a0 <em>Maybe you\u2019d like to go out for supper sometime and see,</em>\u201d he repeated.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I like that.\u00a0 Think it would work on the guy in the purple shirt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything seemed to come to a complete stop in Steve\u2019s mind, like Bucky had just drenched him in ice water and all the warmth from their bantering was draining from his face.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMaybe,\u201d he managed to answer.\u00a0 \u201cTry and see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky gave him a smile and a thumbs up and got up from the table.\u00a0 \u201cGood luck with the guy you\u2019re going to fuck.\u00a0 I\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve wasn\u2019t sure if it was ironic or horrifying that Bucky seemed to have <em>no idea</em>.\u00a0 He managed a wan smile in response that couldn\u2019t look like more than baring his teeth, and his mind was screaming at him, taunting him with the question: <em>where\u2019s your courage now</em>?\u00a0 He watched Bucky leave, and the view was maddeningly good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve was an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky was one too, but it was Steve\u2019s idiocy that just let him walk away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky seemed to jolt to a halt before turning and staring at Steve.\u00a0 He was doing this squinting, confused face as something seemed to occur to him that had him taking a step forward to return to Steve.\u00a0 He sat back down and hit his head against the table, keeping his forehead pressed against the metal top.\u00a0 \u201cIt was me, wasn\u2019t it? \u00a0I'm the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve answered, drawing out the syllables.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky nodded, and the motion was more like he was rocking his face against the table, which was vaguely disgusting, but completely sympathetic.\u00a0 \u201cGood. \u00a0I'm, uh... glad. \u00a0Maybe we could\u2026 uh\u2026 supper?\u00a0 Food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve knew this was not the time to laugh again, but it was tempting.\u00a0 \u201cSure. \u00a0We can go out for supper sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky tilted his face up just enough so he could see Steve.\u00a0 \u201cYou meant that as an invite, didn\u2019t you?\u00a0 Fuck, I\u2019m bad at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky grinned, fast and sharp.\u00a0 \u201cYou know what I\u2019m really good at, though?\u00a0 I\u2019ll fulfill yours if you fulfill mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Steve pointed out, just to be an asshole.\u00a0 \u201cNot fantastic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>x.x.x.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019lo?\u201d Bucky croaked over the phone, sounding sleepy and adorable.\u00a0 Steve stood in the doorway of his bedroom and took in the way the sun looked shining on Bucky\u2019s face.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t really remember how this one night stand thing was supposed to go, but he didn\u2019t think he was supposed to be this happy to wake up with someone in his bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I think I lost your challenge,\u201d Steve answered, smiling as Bucky\u2019s eyes shot open and he turned to look at Steve standing there with his cell phone to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t go through with it, huh?\u201d Bucky asked with a sly grin, running a hand down his chest like a temptation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, I did.\u00a0 I brought him home with me, and we made out against my front door.\u00a0 I blew him on the couch until he almost came, and then fucked him on my bed, slow and slick until he was begging.\u00a0 I\u2019m thinking of doing it again and then feeding him breakfast,\u201d Steve said as he walked towards the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Bucky answered, reaching for him, getting his fingers in Steve\u2019s shirt and pulling him forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI promised you details,\u201d Steve reminded him, sitting on the bed and leaning forward to kiss Bucky, his face tilted up for it.\u00a0 \u201cHow did your night work out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky grinned and it was the first time Steve actually saw his expression when he was shy and uncertain.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going out for supper later,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s real good,\u201d Steve told him over the phone.\u00a0 \u201cMake sure he takes you somewhere that you can sit and talk, so he can show you how much he likes you by paying you all the attention you deserve.\u00a0 Make sure he\u2019s good for you, that he\u2019s a good fit, ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky swallowed and nodded. He reached for Steve, deft fingers pulling at the drawstring of Steve\u2019s pyjama pants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Steve put his hand in Bucky's hair and quickly leaned in for another kiss. \u00a0</span>\u201cI got to go, I think I\u2019m about to get a blow job.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky laughed at him.\u00a0 \u201cI think you might be right.\u201d</p>"
