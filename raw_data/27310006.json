  "text": "<p>Lan Zhan is certain that the wounds on his back won't kill him, but the dreams might.</p>\n<p>The nightmares are typical, if devastating. Watching Wei Ying fall. Holding his broken and lifeless body. Watching A-Yuan fall. Holding his feverish body and watching it catch fire in his arms, watching him burn to death like all the other Wens had died. He wakes up sobbing and miserable and the pain of his ruined back is almost a blessing because at least it\u2019s a pain he\u2019s capable of endearing.</p>\n<p>The worst ones aren\u2019t the nightmares.</p>\n<p>He dreams of Wei Ying playing his guqin. He dreams of him sitting by his side, his teasing voice accompanying the music, although Lan Zhan can never make out what he\u2019s saying, no matter how hard he tries. Sometimes he thinks he feels Wei Ying\u2019s fingers in his hair or against his cheek.</p>\n<p>But then he wakes up and opens his eyes and he\u2019s alone. It\u2019s somehow worse every time, that split second where he forgets and thinks that Wei Ying is alive, that he\u2019s beside him and touching him and talking to him, and then he remembers and it\u2019s like losing Wei Ying all over again, like another new whip across his back. It\u2019s killing him.</p>\n<p>He hopes it never stops. Those short, hazy seconds are precious to him and he hoards them greedily, longing for them even though he knows how painful they are in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is dead and Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to manage to live the rest of his life. The whips didn\u2019t kill him, which is good, he thinks. He\u2019d expected them to, those first couple of days, but they hadn\u2019t, so now he has to figure out how to survive.</p>\n<p>He has to figure out how to want to survive.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a strong enough cultivator that his life is going to be very long, unless something unexpectedly cuts it short. He has more than the average person\u2019s lifetime to live and he has to live it without Wei Ying. He has to figure out how to live in a world that had killed Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Part of him thinks that maybe he doesn\u2019t have to. He could simply let his golden core stop healing the wounds and let nature take his course, let thirty three lashes and infection do to him what it would do to anyone else, and then he doesn\u2019t have to figure out how to manage. His brother would come for his daily visit and find him cold and still, not so different from how he was alive, really.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t. He\u2019d like to say it\u2019s because of what it would do to his brother, because of what it would do to his uncle, because he\u2019s unwilling to find the world unworthy of further study just because it no longer contains Wei Ying. He\u2019d like to say that, but it\u2019s not true.</p>\n<p>Xichen brings him A-Yuan two weeks after he\u2019s carried to the Jingshi, when all he can do is lie on his chest and see if the infection and blood loss will win out against his spiritual energy. A-Yuan looks better, is in the white Lan robes with a disciple ribbon around his forehead. His fever\u2019s broke and he looks a little pale but he\u2019s awake and aware and alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe gentle,\u201d Xichen says quietly, \u201che\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan almost breaks his silence to demand what happened, who had dared touch A-Yuan, when A-Yuan nods solemnly and Lan Zhan realizes that Xichen hadn\u2019t been talking to him. A-Yuan lays down next to him, mirroring his position so he\u2019s turned his head to face him and rested them on his hands. \u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s crying until A-Yuan reaches out to clumsily wipe at his face, his chubby, uncoordinated fingers poking into his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan breathes out, then croaks, \u201cDo not be sorry.\u201d He sees his brother startle and doesn\u2019t react to it. It\u2019s the first thing he\u2019s said since his bitter words during his punishment. \u201cYou have done nothing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, but seems doubtful. He stops wiping at his face to put his hand on top of Lan Zhan\u2019s, his dark eyes wide and concerned, and all his memories are gone, but in that simple fearless compassion he sees Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>This is Wei Ying\u2019s son, as much as if they shared blood, and he\u2019s alive. The world is large and life is long and the only person Lan Zhan can trust with Wei Ying\u2019s son, the only person he can trust to not raise him on twisted, untrue tales of his father, is himself.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan is here, and alive, which means Lan Zhan must also be here, must also live.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are wearing the wrong ribbon,\u201d he says. He reaches up, ignoring the wave of fire along his back as scabs rip themselves open and blood flows freely down his back, and unties his own forehead ribbon. He doesn\u2019t have the strength to twist his body enough to tie it on A-Yuan for him, so instead he places it in A-Yuan\u2019s hand. \u201cWear this one instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hurts, to give up the ribbon that Wei Ying had touched, but it\u2019s right that it should go to his son, that he gives away what little of Wei Ying he has to the boy who would have known him as a father in a kinder, more just world.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Xichen says, startled, \u201care you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan places his hand on A-Yuan\u2019s back, comforted by the way it rises and falls with his breaths, and doesn\u2019t look away from the boy he\u2019ll raise as his own son, just as Wei Ying would do if he were still alive. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has Wei Ying\u2019s son to raise and to love, a world to make a little bright and kinder than it was when Wei Ying left it, and he\u2019s going to live.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has been dead for almost two months the first time Lan Xichen hears music coming from the Jingshi.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late, later than he\u2019d come by normally, but he\u2019d just got back from a diplomatic meeting in Lanling, and even being around A-Yao hadn\u2019t made up from for not being able to see his brother. Which is why he\u2019s here now, far past curfew when he knows Wangji is already asleep.</p>\n<p>Wangji is still too ill to move, the thin scabs across his back sometimes breaking and bleeding anew if he breathes too deeply. Even if he could force himself to sit up straight for long enough to play the chords, the player is clearly unpracticed. The song is Healing, the music rough and uncertain but unmistakable, and he feels a rush of affection for whichever disciple has risked being thrown from their sect to sneak into his brother\u2019s rooms as he sleeps to try to help him.</p>\n<p>For a moment he considers turning around, pretending he never heard anything, but doesn\u2019t. He is willing to overlook this. Uncle and the clan elders won\u2019t be. Wangji is in seclusion and he has to heal on his own, under his own spiritual power.</p>\n<p>The thirty three lashes hadn\u2019t killed him, and they won\u2019t. Wangji is already healing so much more quickly than even he thought he would.</p>\n<p>He pushes open the door and freezes.</p>\n<p>His brother\u2019s guqin is playing itself. The strings are being plucked slowly and carefully, but no one is there except Wangji, who lays unconscious on his stomach. He breathes in through his teeth, too quickly and too loudly, and the playing cuts off with a discordant twang.</p>\n<p>The door slams shut on his face. He rushes to yank it open again, but it doesn\u2019t budge. Healing starts up again, and he bangs on the door, trying to rip it open with brute strength in his panic when talismans prove useless. There is something in there with his injured baby brother. He tries a window next, which won\u2019t move, won\u2019t be shattered, but at least now he can see.</p>\n<p>He should call for help, should send a flare for Uncle and the other disciples, but he sees something that makes him pause. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Rippling across the strings of the guqin are whisps of red spiritual energy. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen passes the night standing at the window, watching. Healing is played again and again, for hours, until the sky turns grey with morning, until it\u2019s nearly but not quite five. The song is stronger and smoother at the end of the night than at the beginning.</p>\n<p>When the song doesn\u2019t start up again, he pushes the window. It opens easily. The door is the same, opening with no resistance.</p>\n<p>He sits next to his brother, watching as he slowly awakens. \u201cWangji,\u201d he greets quietly, \u201chow are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji looks at him. It doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s seeing him. The only time his brother reacts to anything is when he\u2019ll bring A-Yuan to see him.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen leans forward and carefully lifts the sheet off his brother\u2019s back. Wangji is a strong cultivator, one of the strongest of their generation, of course. Anything less and thirty three lashes would have killed him. But the thick scabs covering his skin are so much more than he\u2019d had when Lan Xichen saw him a week ago. There\u2019s not even any blood on the sheet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re healing well,\u201d he says, trying to keep his voice even.</p>\n<p>Wangji\u2019s face doesn\u2019t so much as twitch.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know, then.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen talks of his trip and all that\u2019s occurred in the past week and leaves when a servant comes to feed Wangji breakfast. He should get some sleep himself, perhaps, or attend to one of the many duties requiring his attention as sect leader.</p>\n<p>Instead he goes to the library. Nothing he finds can explain what he saw. That night he waits until after curfew and makes him way back to the Jingshi. He doesn\u2019t bother with the door, instead going straight to the window, and waiting.</p>\n<p>Sometime close to midnight, the guqin starts to play itself, shimmering red spiritual energy pouring over the strings. It\u2019s Healing again and this time it starts better than before, almost smoothly. It\u2019s not perfect but the notes are all correct and once again as the hours pass it improves.</p>\n<p>Ghosts shouldn\u2019t be able to learn new skills.</p>\n<p>Ghosts shouldn\u2019t be able to harness spiritual energy.</p>\n<p>Ghosts shouldn\u2019t be able to interact with spiritual tools.</p>\n<p>Then again, Wei Wuxian had always excelled at doing things that he shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The playing cuts off abruptly and he doesn\u2019t understand why until he hears a soft sob.</p>\n<p>Wangji is crying, eyes still shut, shifting painfully. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he gasps. It\u2019s the first time Lan Xichen has heard him speak since his punishment without A-Yuan present, and for a moment he thinks Wangji has woken up, that\u2019s he heard the playing and figured it out, but his eyes are still closed.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s having a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen means to force his way inside, angry ghost of the Yiling Patriarch or no, but then his brother lets out slow breath, settling, the pain easing from his face as he falls back into a more peaceful sleep. \u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair is moving on its own, so subtly Lan Xichen might not have noticed it if he hadn\u2019t been looking at Wangji so intently. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s running their hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>The window frosts over suddenly, thick enough that he can\u2019t see through it. Anxiety spikes through him so quickly he\u2019s nauseous with it, but then the frost melts away and the opening notes of Healing start up again.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a warning or not. Maybe it\u2019s just an acknowledgement. Wei Wuxian knows he\u2019s there.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen comes back every night for the next week. He\u2019s a strong enough cultivator that he can get away with a couple hours of sleep in the middle of the day with no ill effects, but it\u2019s far from pleasant.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same thing. Wei Wuxian plays for about half the night. If Wangji has a nightmare, he runs his fingers through his hair or does something else that Lan Xichen can\u2019t make out until he calms. Once the nightmare had been too deep and too violent and Lan Xichen had watched his brother\u2019s body jerk roughly and strangely, as if someone were shaking his shoulder, before he\u2019d groggily opened his eyes, face wet with tears and his hand reaching for someone who isn\u2019t there. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t come back that night.</p>\n<p>He waits until after curfew but before midnight to take out his own guqin. The first notes of Inquiry are almost a shock, as if he really can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this, but his fingers remain steady.</p>\n<p>No one answers.</p>\n<p>He frowns, playing, <em>Wei Wuxian?</em></p>\n<p>That\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s skilled enough that spirits should have no choice but to answer him, and however strange he might be, Wei Wuxian is still a spirit.</p>\n<p>He tries again. <em>Wei Wuxian. Answer me. </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a crash, glass shattering, and he lifts his arm to protect his face before he realizes it\u2019s just his teapot from this afternoon, the pieces of the porcelain scattered all across his floor, too many and too far flung than if it had just been tipped up on its side. It looks more like someone had lifted it above their head and hurled it down on the floor.</p>\n<p>The cold dredges of tea drag across the floor until they\u2019re recognizable words.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck you</em>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s almost more baffling than if Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t answered him at all. He should be answering through Inquiry, should <em>have </em>to answer using the guqin language. Lan Xichen is the best player in the clan. He stares at his hands, running the notes over again in his mind, trying to see where he\u2019d slipped, but can\u2019t. He plays again, more carefully this time. <em>Who are you? </em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible the spirit isn\u2019t Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>The teacup goes sailing to land right in the middle of the words scribbled in tea, cracking right down the middle.</p>\n<p>There are two quick, sharp knocks against his wall. It\u2019s not guqin language, but is easy enough to translate. <em>Fuck. You. </em></p>\n<p>He goes to play another question, but the strings play themselves. Not like they do when interpreting a spirit\u2019s answer, but as if someone else is playing them. Red spiritual energy flickers in front of him as the opening to Inquiry is played back at him, jerkily if correctly, and Lan Xichen can tell he\u2019s being mocked.</p>\n<p>He slams his hand against the strings, silencing them, heart in his throat. He doesn\u2019t know what happens when a ghost plays Inquiry, since it shouldn\u2019t be possible, but he doesn\u2019t want to find out. \u201cAlright,\u201d he croaks, banishing the guqin with a wave of his hand. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence. He\u2019d like to say that he could sense another presence, that he knows he\u2019s being watched, but he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s been around ghosts before, can usually sense them a mile off, but not Wei Wuxian. If he didn\u2019t know that he wasn\u2019t alone, he wouldn\u2019t suspect anything.</p>\n<p>What does it mean? What kind of spirit or ghoul has Wei Wuxian become in death?</p>\n<p>Not a normal one, clearly. So perhaps the normal methods of communicating with the dead are unnecessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d he tries, pleased when his voice comes out even.</p>\n<p>Another knock. <em>Yes</em>.</p>\n<p>Right. He can work with this. He\u2019d rather it was the guqin, where they could have more complex conversations. He\u2019d rather it was the guqin, where Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t lie to him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what to ask. If he\u2019s going to hurt Wangji? He\u2019s pretty sure that will just get him more shattered glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>This time it\u2019s less of a knock and more the sound of someone tapping their nails against the wood, as if impatient.</p>\n<p>He resists the urge to point out that he\u2019s not the one insisting on this inefficient communication method. \u201cAre you here for Wangji?\u201d</p>\n<p>Knock. <em>Yes</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you only here for Wangji?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time a sound like slapping an open palm against his wall. <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>He swallows. \u201cRevenge?\u201d</p>\n<p>A slap, louder this time. <em>No.</em></p>\n<p>Lan Xichen expects that to be a comfort. It\u2019s not.\u00a0 He looks at the shattered glass and the tea which has dripped out of the formation so they\u2019re no longer spelling anything unrecognizable. \u201cYou\u2019re angry with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Knock. <em>Yes</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Nightless city.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another pause. Slap. <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s unexpected. \u201cFor what happened to the Wens?\u201d Healers and old men and even older women all killed. The supposed cultivator army Wei Wuxian had been leading had never made an appearance.</p>\n<p>A longer pause, but still another slap. <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to ask that, but he can\u2019t take it back now.</p>\n<p>Nails tapping. It\u2019s not a yes or no question and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t seem interested in spelling out any more helpful messages in his tea.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen is almost grateful to move on when one his books topples to the ground. The pages flip for several moments, then stop. He has to step carefully over the glass to pick it up. It\u2019s a book of poetry, one he wouldn\u2019t have expected Wei Wuxian to have read. It\u2019s open on a poem titled <em>Expectations</em>. <em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use in getting angry about that,\u201d he says, not quite able to put a name to the tone of his own voice. \u201cIt\u2019s what you all knew would happen. That\u2019s why you hid. We were only acting as you expected we would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Knock. <em>Yes</em>.</p>\n<p>He smooths the page even though it isn\u2019t bent. Wei Wuxian thought they would murder the Wens, and they had. He thought they\u2019d come for him for trying to protect them, and they had.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you kill Jin Zixuan?\u201d As the leader of violent, bloodthirsty sect, it had made sense. As a desperate man trying to protect a band of half starved refugees, it made no sense at all.</p>\n<p>Slap.</p>\n<p>He blinks. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill Jin Zixuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Knock.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nail tapping, but quicker this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Knock.</p>\n<p>They aren\u2019t speaking through Inquiry. Wei Wuxian could be lying.</p>\n<p>He puts it aside for now, not sure what to do with this information even if it\u2019s true. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re angry with me.\u201d Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t ever seemed to dislike him when he was alive, even when he and Wangji had been at odds with each other.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not expecting the blow and it drives him to his knees, the book falling from his hands and his knees crashing into the broken glass. It\u2019s a line of fiery hot pain across his back once, then twice, and the third time forces a gasp past his lips even as he tries to remember a banishment talisman strong enough that it may work on Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s gone. He reaches for his back, expecting to find blood and tattered robes, but his skin is unbroken, and all that\u2019s left is the memory of pain.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t understand until he does and the realization leaves him cold. \u201cYou\u2019re angry with me because of what happened with Wangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time the knock is loud enough that it echoes.</p>\n<p>He breathes in deeply, holding it for a moment before letting it out. \u201cWangji was punished because of what he did to defend you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another knock, quieter this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is because of you,\u201d he says, letting some of the bitterness creep into his tone.</p>\n<p>Knock. He thinks this might be easier if Wei Wuxian would deny it, if he refused to take responsibility for his injured baby brother.</p>\n<p>Except he is taking responsibility, isn\u2019t he? Wangji is healing far quicker than he would normally. He\u2019s having his nightmare soothed. Wei Wuxian<em> is</em> taking care of Wangji, as much as he can, in ways a spirit shouldn\u2019t even be capable of.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>Slap!</p>\n<p>He looks down, his eyes catching on the book of poetry again. Expectations. Wei Wuxian had expected his refugees to be killed. He\u2019d expected them to hate him and destroy him. Those weren\u2019t things he was angry about with him specifically because he\u2019d already accepted them.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d expected Lan Xichen to protect his brother, and he hadn\u2019t, and now Wei Wuxian is angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have choice,\u201d he says tightly.</p>\n<p>More tapping, but not impatient this time, sharper and trailing off. He can almost hear the sound of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mocking laughter in the sound.</p>\n<p>An impossible choice is still a choice. Wei Wuxian had made his impossible choice and it had ended up killing him and all the people he was trying to protect, but he\u2019d still made it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the right choice,\u201d he says, because it was. He hated it, but his brother needed to be punished, and this was better than some alternatives. What was he supposed to do? Leave the clan and take his brother away and become wandering cultivators? It\u2019s what Wei Wuxian would have done, perhaps, but he\u2019s not Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Another slap. <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t answer any more questions that night, but when Lan Xichen walks out to the Jingshi, the smooth, almost perfect notes of Healing hang in the air.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng hadn\u2019t been able to find his brother.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t understand. Cultivators don\u2019t fall to their death, especially not ones as strong as Wei Wuxian. He goes down looking for him, anger and grief and fear roiling in his stomach, but doesn\u2019t find him. If he\u2019d just disappeared, then Jiang Cheng would assume he\u2019d just walked away, gone back into hiding, but it\u2019s not that what he doesn\u2019t find.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s what he does.</p>\n<p>A torn, bloody over robe, bunched up together as if someone had tried to use it to put pressure on a wound. More blood, a trail of it like someone had dragged themselves, because they couldn\u2019t walk, to the edge of a rushing river at the bottom of the cliff. Then nothing.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is a strong swimmer. But the river is churning swiftly and if he hadn\u2019t been strong enough to walk, he wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to swim.</p>\n<p>The most damning, of course, is Chenqing.</p>\n<p>The flute lies abandoned and bloody. Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t leave it behind, not on purpose, but it\u2019s not just that. Chenqing is a spiritual tool, like Zidian but somehow even more volatile. It doesn\u2019t let anyone besides Wei Wuxian handle it.</p>\n<p>But when Jiang Cheng picks it up, it doesn\u2019t so much as burn against his fingertips.</p>\n<p>Chenqing is too temperamental to be handled by anyone besides its master. Unless, of course, his master is gone.</p>\n<p>Unless Wei Wuxian is dead.</p>\n<p>People keep congratulating him for killing the Yiling Patriarch, as if that\u2019s something he\u2019d meant to do, something he\u2019d wanted. A-jie had died to protect their brother. How could he spit in the face of her sacrifice by killing him?</p>\n<p>How could Wei Wuxian die after their sister had given up her life for his? With both of his siblings dead, what was the <em>point</em> of any of it? But Wei Wuxian shouldn\u2019t be dead, that fall shouldn\u2019t have killed them, and they never found a body, so \u2013 so.</p>\n<p>He works late now. He always does, falling asleep at his desk more often than not, because \u2013 because \u2013</p>\n<p>Because, is all.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been working on the disciples\u2019 training schedule and hadn\u2019t gotten further than a vague outline before his eyelids had refused to open and he\u2019d put his head on his desk, telling himself it would just be five minutes. He wakes up a little before dawn with a deep ache in his shoulder from how he\u2019d slept slumped over and winces as rolls it out, sending a burst of spiritual energy to ease the ache, but then he ends up blinking at his desk in confusion.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d barely started the disciple training regiment before falling asleep. But there are several pages of plans in front of him and a half empty ink well. He skims them, baffled, because they\u2019re good, actually, brilliant, even if he wouldn\u2019t have put together an archery regime quite so demanding or a talisman course that detailed.</p>\n<p>He pauses, wondering if perhaps he\u2019s still dreaming. He wouldn\u2019t have done that. He didn\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t even his handwriting.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s handwriting he recognizes.</p>\n<p>He stands up so quickly the chair goes toppling backwards, looking around the room wildly, as if expecting to find his brother in a corner, laughing at him and smiling and not dead.</p>\n<p>But no one is there. He interrogates the patrol, but they hadn\u2019t seen anything. He picks up Chenqing and it still doesn\u2019t react to his touch. Still masterless. Maybe they\u2019re old lesson plans, ones Wei Wuxian drafted, before everything. Maybe he\u2019d found it before going to sleep and just doesn\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t explain the half empty inkwell.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t understand. But he uses the lesson plans. When he gives them to Li Shuchun, his current first disciple, she stills, running her fingers over the dried ink, and his words die in his throat.</p>\n<p>Li Shuchun had been right behind him and Wei Wuxian, and his brother had always had more patience and time to teach the disciples than he had. It would probably have caused some rumors, him picking his brother\u2019s favorite pupil to take his place, but the Jiang don\u2019t gossip and no one else cares. \u201cProblem?\u201d he snaps.</p>\n<p>She looks up at him then, eyes wide, and his anger melts away under her grief, until he\u2019s sure she can read his own just as easily, as she holds lesson plans obviously if inexplicably written by his brother\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>The Wen had called Wen Ruohan their clan leader until their last breath.</p>\n<p>It would take a lot more than Nightless city for his disciples to stop thinking of Wei Wuxian as Senior Brother Wei.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says finally, and bows, the lessons plans held reverently in her hands.</p>\n<p>If it were just that once, maybe it could be something he could ignore. But it\u2019s not once. He falls asleep over a pile of work and wakes up to find it done, his correspondence drafted and the complaints sorted, even the accounting books balanced, with a couple of notes that certain merchants are overcharging them. All in his brother\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>He interrogates all the disciples, cold and furious and betrayed at the idea that any of them would think this an acceptable sort of prank to play, at the idea anyone in his sect could be this cruel, but they all swear up and down that they had nothing to do with it. He locks the doors and it doesn\u2019t make a difference, he can\u2019t catch whoever keeps sneaking into his office to finish his work.</p>\n<p>One night he wakes up slowly and opens his eyes just enough to see the brush gliding across the page all on its own. It pauses, then taps itself against the edge of the desk in a quick, irritated rhythm that Jiang Cheng would know anywhere, before going back to writing, not quite as quickly.</p>\n<p>Tears leak out of his eyes and drip down his nose onto whatever papers he\u2019s laying on. He stays still, breathing evenly, and watching the brush move for hours with half lidded eyes. It\u2019s still the middle of the night when the brush wipes itself clean and the night\u2019s work is organized into tiny little piles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>Everything stops. He closes his eyes again, resigned, but then he feels the pressure of a familiar arm around his shoulders, no warmth but the right weight, and then it\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>He buries his face and arms and cries for a long time, in the middle of the night, in his office, where no one can see him, the only place he\u2019s allowed to cry for his brother.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is a ghost.</p>\n<p>That means Wei Wuxian really is dead.</p>\n<p>It means Jiang Cheng killed the brother their sister died to save.</p>\n<p>No one at Lotus Pier says anything about his red, swollen eyes. Why would they? It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have plenty to mourn.</p>\n<p>It keeps happening and Jiang Cheng can\u2019t decide if he wants to laugh or cry. Of course Wei Wuxian is more useful dead than when he was alive.</p>\n<p>Of course he leaves him notes about greedy merchants and not anything useful, like where his body is or if he\u2019s able to talk to A-jie or if he hates him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wangji is well enough that he can sit upright for a few hours a day. The only time he speaks is to A-Yuan, the war orphan he\u2019s claimed as a son, and he sits with him in his lap for those hours that he\u2019s able to keep himself upright. The doctors make incredulous notes about his progress, speaking of the impressive strength of Hanguang Jun, and Lan Xichen smiles and nods and tries not to think of the smooth, perfect chords of Healing that fill the Jingshi each night.</p>\n<p>The first night Wangji has the spiritual energy to spare, he plays Inquiry.</p>\n<p>He plays it the next night, and the one after that, and every night after. It\u2019s a waste of spiritual energy. He never receives an answer.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen tries not to feel grateful for that and fails. Wei Wuxian is still hiding his presence from his brother, but it\u2019s for the best. Wangji will never be able to move on from his grief, to heal, if Wei Wuxian is there constantly tearing the wound open anew. Wangji still has nightmares of Wei Wuxian falling, is still sunken deep in his grief. The only thing that pull him out is the child, and the daily visits shouldn\u2019t be allowed, technically, but Lan Xichen can\u2019t help but encourage this one thing that holds his brother\u2019s attention that has nothing to do with Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>He worries, sometimes, that if weren\u2019t for A-Yuan, his brother would have simply faded away in front of him, in a way that had nothing to do with his injuries.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a cold night and he\u2019s out too late when he walks by the children\u2019s dorms to hear a soft giggle. He pauses, listening. He doesn\u2019t enforce the curfew that strictly, especially not with children, but it\u2019s so late that not being asleep is past the point of irresponsible into being unhealthy, so he slides the door open.</p>\n<p>He experiences a horrible moment where he thinks, almost hysterically, that he\u2019s been through this before. Thankfully, this time the door doesn\u2019t slam shut in his face. He should leave, or come forward, but this way he\u2019s mostly hidden from sight while still being able to see everything himself.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan is sitting upright in his bed and paper butterflies are flying around his head, the movements smooth but small, as if they\u2019re being moved by invisible hands rather a talisman. \u201cGive, give!\u201d he whispers, eagerly making grabbing motions, and one of the paper butterflies makes its way into his hands. \u201cKiss?\u201d</p>\n<p>The other paper butterfly dutifully taps against the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d A-Yuan whines, still speaking softly enough not to wake the other children. He points to himself. \u201cKiss!\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause, then A-Yuan\u2019s hair moves itself off his forehead. He flinches and Lan Xichen grips the doorframe. Surely Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t harm a child \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cCold,\u201d he mutters, rubbing at his forehead, then frowns and points at his cheek. \u201cKiss!\u201d</p>\n<p>This time he giggles rather than flinching. Lan Xichen wonders if it\u2019s still cold. He repeats the motion, pointing to his other cheek, and A-Yuan\u2019s laughs loud enough that one of the disciples shifts in his sleep. He clasps his hands over his mouth and then lowers them enough to whisper, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>The paper butterflies both settle on A-Yuan\u2019s nightstand and then the covers pull themselves back. A-Yuan pouts but dutifully snuggles beneath them. Lan Xichen watches the blanket tuck itself in around A-Yuan\u2019s shoulders and his hair move strangely, like someone\u2019s running their hand through it, which continues until his breathes deepen into sleep.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a cold blast of air against the back of his neck and he slaps his hand against the exposed skin on instinct. There\u2019s a tapping sound along the doorframe, quick and light, as if Wei Wuxian is laughing at him.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen isn\u2019t laughing.</p>\n<p>Maybe it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Maybe Wei Wuxian came across a kid who couldn\u2019t sleep and decided to entertain him. Maybe he sought A-Yuan out because he\u2019s Wangji\u2019s adopted child.</p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p>But he remembers Wangji bringing the child back, burning with a fever so high that it had taken all of the child\u2019s memories with it. Wangji said the child\u2019s name was Yuan and they hadn\u2019t questioned it, hadn\u2019t had the time to question it with everything that had been going on. But perhaps they should have.</p>\n<p>He finds himself looking at the child\u2019s face whenever he sees him, trying to find traces of Wei Wuxian there, but if anything the child looks more like Wangji. If the Yiling Patriarch had fathered a child, someone would have heard about it. He thinks.</p>\n<p>He could ask, either Wei Wuxian or Wangji, but if it\u2019s true he doesn\u2019t think either of them would tell him, and if it\u2019s not then he gains nothing by asking. So he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>But he watches. A-Yuan isn\u2019t the only child Wei Wuxian interacts with, doing it brazenly out in public, where anyone could see him. Except no one but him knows to look. Having an imaginary friend isn\u2019t forbidden, not for children so young, so no one thinks anything of it when the kids giggle and talk to someone who isn\u2019t there, when they pretend to hold a hand that doesn\u2019t exist or their hair ruffles strangely in the breeze.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to chalk it up to Wei Wuxian liking kids and not having much to do, considering he\u2019s dead and lingering as a ghost. But he spends the most time with A-Yuan from what he can see, and Lan Xichen has made it almost a habit to walk by the child\u2019s dorms a little after curfew.</p>\n<p>Almost always there\u2019s quiet laughter, almost always Wei Wuxian tucks him into bed and gives into multiple demands for kisses on chubby cheeks.</p>\n<p>He could try and put a stop to it, but if A-Yuan really is his son, then it seems cruel. If he\u2019s not, then, then \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know, but it\u2019s not as if he\u2019s doing any harm. Lan Xichen has been watching, and he really isn\u2019t doing anything malicious, because then all of this would be too <em>easy</em> of course. If Wei Wuxian were a vengeful spirit or cruel or disruptive, then Lan Xichen could justify banishing him, but.</p>\n<p>But instead he plays Healing for Wangji and plays with children, one of which may or may not be his son but is certainly Wangji\u2019s.</p>\n<p>He could ask, but he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He feels like he\u2019s doing a lot of that lately.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan knows that he\u2019s expending valuable spiritual energy that he could be using to speed up his healing process, but it\u2019s not a <em>waste</em>.</p>\n<p>Even if Wei Ying doesn\u2019t answer, it\u2019s not a waste. He just doesn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>Even weakened like this, his grasp of Inquiry is unapparelled by anyone except perhaps his brother. Spirits should have to answer his call. Wei Ying should answer.</p>\n<p>Spirits who have moved on, who no longer linger at the edges of the mortal realm, can only be compelled to answer a few questions. Their name. How they were killed. If they\u2019re at peace. He knew the answer to the second question and didn\u2019t intent to ask it, although perhaps he would, just to get Wei Ying\u2019s presence to linger a couple moments longer, even if it hurt to hear.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought that maybe, considering how he\u2019d died, Wei Ying might be close to the mortal realm still. He\u2019d thought that maybe he\u2019d be able to get something close to one last conversation out of Wei Ying, even muted and handicapped as it would be through Inquiry. Even if he hadn\u2019t, he still thought it would be alright.</p>\n<p>He fantasizes about it, while he\u2019s healing and nourishing his golden core, trying to regain enough strength to play without threatening his life. Wei Ying is gone. Lan Zhan has countless years empty of Wei Ying waiting for him, but he thought that maybe he could have this. He would raise and love their son. He would do his duty as the Second Jade of Lan. He would help as many people as he could, as Wei Ying had always tried to do, and then at the end of the day he would be able to take out his guqin and be selfish.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a simple dream. One he took as an inevitability. He would play, <em>Wei Ying? </em>He\u2019d get and affirmative response, and he\u2019s ask, <em>What is your name? </em>Not because he didn\u2019t know the answer, but because he wanted to hear it.</p>\n<p>The cords would pluck out, <em>Wei Ying</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Are you at peace?</em> The answer to this one isn\u2019t something he knows for sure, but he hopes.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying would say, <em>Yes</em>, and that would it, the end of the answers he\u2019d be able to compel with Inquiry.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan would pack his guqin away until the next night and hold the single note of <em>Yes</em> close to his heart. He\u2019d live off it, the same way he once lived off on monthly visits to see his mother, and it wouldn\u2019t be enough, it wouldn\u2019t be what he wanted, but it would be his, it would be something to hold onto.</p>\n<p>Except he plays, every night, and there is no answer. He should stop, perhaps. But he won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t offer Wei Ying an open hand for him to hold onto until it was too late. He won\u2019t be the one to close his hand this time, even if Wei Wuxian never takes it, is never able to take it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mianmian cries for a long time when she hears of the events of Nightless City, when she hears that her best friend and his wife are dead and that Wei Wuxian has been killed by his own brother\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>She cries because she knows that it\u2019s wrong, that even if all the events are true the rumors and stories around them aren\u2019t. Wei Wuxian would never kill Jin Zixuan, would slit his own throat before harming Jiang Yanli, and Jiang Cheng, no matter his rage, would not raise his blade against his brother in a killing blow.</p>\n<p>The picture doesn\u2019t fit right. She knows there are pieces missing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s something like in that day in the Jin hall, where everyone had talked and talked and said not a single true thing, placing all the blame on Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders and none of it on their own, refusing to see reason or sense. Mianmian knew Wei Wuxian. He\u2019d been flighty and loud and charming. He\u2019d been brave and kind with the type of unshakable moral center that the Nie and Lan talked about having but have never managed to live by half as well as Wei Wuxian had.</p>\n<p>So she cries, because she thinks that maybe leaving the sect was a mistake, that if she\u2019d been there maybe she could have put a stop to it, but she knows that isn\u2019t true. No matter her rank, Jin Zixuan had been the only one to ever listen to her, and even he was powerless against his father. Her being there probably wouldn\u2019t have made any difference at all, but she wasn\u2019t there, so she\u2019ll never know.</p>\n<p>Mianmian is polishing her blade in the room of another inn, trying not to let her thoughts wander, because she never likes the direction they take, when she feels something yank on her hair.</p>\n<p>She raises her blade and curves it behind her, because she knows she\u2019s alone, but it passes through the air, not even a hint of the tingling sensation that happens when a cultivation blade comes in contact with a ghoul or spirit. She doesn\u2019t sense anything, but she knows what she felt. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Another yank on her hair and then the feeling of a blow to her chest, but it\u2019s nothing painful, more pressure than actual sensation.</p>\n<p>She lays her hand across it, rubbing her chest, and a terrible combination of hope and disbelief seeps into her. \u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d It\u2019s the same place where he took a Wen brand meant for her.</p>\n<p>This time it\u2019s a tug on her robes, not even enough to move them out of place. It\u2019s playful.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d she says, but hesitates. She doesn\u2019t understand, and she <em>wants</em> to believe it\u2019s him, to be able to talk to him one last time, but there are many kinds of spirits that pretend to be something they\u2019re not. \u201cHow do I know it\u2019s you?\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause, and then an erratic tapping sensation on her shoulder, as if he\u2019s drumming his fingers as he thinks, and that nearly convinces her all on its own. It stops and then her bag moves of its own accord, paper and ink taken out of it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s intrigued. It\u2019s rare for ghosts to retain enough of a grasp of language to be able to write, although of course Wei Wuxian would be one of them.</p>\n<p>The brush moves across the page confidently if messily. Mianmian sits and reads the words as they\u2019re written and slowly her disbelief bleeds to rage before settling on determination.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t undo any of the terrible events that she wasn\u2019t there to witness. Jin Zixuan, Jiang Yanli, and Wei Wuxian are dead and there\u2019s nothing she can do about that.</p>\n<p>But this is something she can do, so she will.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath, giving himself a second to settle back more firmly into his body, to feel the ache along his chest and the way his heart beats too fast and sweat pricks along the back of his neck, then he lets it out. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s helping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Xiao Xingchen asks, his voice not quite angry but his posture stiff and uncomfortable. \u201cYou\u2019re gone longer each time. What if one time you don\u2019t find your way back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does not sigh and does force his face into something approaching a smile. \u201cI will. It really is helping, you know I\u2019m right. It\u2019s just my luck I\u2019m stuck like this when Jiang Cheng walked away a couple hours later like nothing had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d Xiao Xingchen says severely, some of his admirable control beginning to slip, \u201chad been mostly healthy, while you were mostly dead, and his body had been accustomed to holding a golden core at least somewhat as strong as yours, and Jiang Cheng had <em>Wen Qing</em>, the brightest medical mind of several generations, and all you and Teacher have is <em>me</em> and I\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ignores the way his body nearly locks up in pain and pushes himself up enough to grab Xiao Xinchen\u2019s wrist, feeling the way his pulse is beating too quickly, and says, \u201cHey, sorry, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean \u2013 you\u2019re doing great, it\u2019s okay.\u201d If he makes Xiao Xingchen cry then Song Lan will kill him which will really ruin a lot of people\u2019s hard work.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not,\u201d he says quietly, but his pulse has slowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really are,\u201d Wei Wuxian says warmly, \u201clook, we\u2019re both recovering, we\u2019re doing great, you\u2019ve been great!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTeacher will recover,\u201d he agrees, and his lips briefly press together into a flat line, because there\u2019s only so much recovering she can do, really. They both don\u2019t look at the unconscious woman in the bed next to his. Healing meditations are effective, but disconcerting, especially when someone\u2019s been in one for months. \u201cYou may not.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a reason, after all, that Wei Wuxian has been letting people believe his consciousnesses projection is his ghost. There\u2019s still a pretty good chance he won\u2019t make it, that it won\u2019t take, and he\u2019ll die anyway. There\u2019s no reason to make anyone mourn him a second time.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s pain almost breaks him. Wei Wuxian longs to pull him close, to tell Lan Zhan everything, to do something that will lift his cloud of grief. But if this is what him dying has done to Lan Zhan, how much worse will it be for him to die again, to give Lan Zhan hope only to snatch it away? He doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t want to find out.</p>\n<p>Besides. This second chance doesn\u2019t belong to him and he\u2019s probably not going to be able to keep it.</p>\n<p>He swallows, steels himself, then says, \u201cYou can still put it back. She\u2019ll heal faster, and it\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll <em>die</em>,\u201d Xiao Xingchen says, his voice catching at the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably die anyway,\u201d he points out. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m just me, and she\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s who she is, and I am who I am, and I don\u2019t \u2013 you should put it back. This isn\u2019t a fair trade and you know it, you know the world is a better place with her in it, and at this rate I\u2019m going to die anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>, those are definitely tears in Xiao Xingchen\u2019s eyes. He really hadn\u2019t wanted that. \u201cShould she have asked you first? Like you asked Jiang Cheng before you did it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d he argues. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother, and the future sect leader, he needed it. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen shakes his head, running his arm over his eyes to wipe the tears off his face. \u201cStop it. No. Just, just lie down, please.\u201d He grabs Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder to help ease him back down, but jerks his hand back, eyes wide. His mouth settles into a grim line and he presses the back his hand to his forehead. \u201cYour fever is spiking again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not surprised. But now Xiao Xingchen is worried and he looks suspiciously close to crying some more, which he hates, he feels terrible whenever it happens. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re at death\u2019s door already when you want me to kill you and perfectly fine when I\u2019m worried about you?\u201d he asks. His voice is gentle but it sounds tired, sounds as exhausted as he must be feeling after months of having to look after both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m probably not going to survive this,\u201d he says quietly, honestly. \u201cYou should put it back before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen leans down to press his forehead to Wei Wuxian\u2019s, his lips trembling. \u201cNephew,\u201d he says, \u201cplease stop asking me to hurt you. I won\u2019t. Teacher made her decision, and I made my decision, and you really didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. You don\u2019t need to feel guilty, just as you do not want your brother to feel guilty. Don\u2019t waste this gift. Don\u2019t rush towards death when there is so much for you to live for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey threw a banquet when they thought I died,\u201d he says, an ache in his throat that he wishes he could blame on anything else. \u201cThey toasted to it, sang about it. They celebrated it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everyone,\u201d he says, there are people he loves who still love him. But trading his life for anyone else\u2019s seems wrong. This life doesn\u2019t belong to him, he shouldn\u2019t have it. \u201cPlease. You have so much left to offer the world. She wouldn\u2019t have done it if she didn\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p>\n<p>That thought hurts, more than falling, more than anything, but he has no defense against it, so he just hums and says, \u201cOkay, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen sighs, then straightens. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll go get you something for the fever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t say that there isn\u2019t a point, that there\u2019s nothing to do but to wait and see if his body eats itself alive.</p>\n<p>He was a strong cultivator, the strongest of their generation except perhaps Lan Zhan. His golden core had been more powerful than most people\u2019s, actually, and he\u2019d tried not to be too arrogant about that. It's what had saved his life, it's what had turned disfiguring or deadly treatment under Madame Yu\u2019s whip to something he was able to walk away from, something he\u2019d already half recovered from a week later. He\u2019d thought he understood what it meant to have a powerful golden core.</p>\n<p>But Baoshan Sanren has been cultivating her golden core for seven hundred years. It sits in his chest now, but it\u2019s too much, his body isn\u2019t prepared to handle it, especially as he\u2019d received it, broken and barely holding on to life after falling from the cliff. It\u2019s burning him up, tearing his body apart from the inside.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a race now, to see if his new golden core is able to heal him faster than it\u2019s killing him. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wen Ning is going to be the death of his sister and there\u2019s nothing he can do to stop it.</p>\n<p>Jiejie is even thinner than she\u2019d been in the burial mounds, pale and desperate and <em>angry</em>. They makes her experiment on him, trying to find ways to control him.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s refused, at first, and had only relented when he\u2019d begged her to do it, when he\u2019d pleaded and come as close as he could to crying. She digs pin into his head and he hates it and she hates it but it means they\u2019re keeping her alive for a little while longer, it means he gets more time with his sister in this dark and lonely cell. But eventually she\u2019ll figure it out, find out how to make him docile and blank and easy to control, and then they\u2019ll kill her, and Wen Ning won\u2019t be able to do anything about it because his free will be gone and then \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know what comes after. Something terrible, he supposes.</p>\n<p>He tries not to dwell on the pain, on the parts of his life that feel like what he remembers a bruise feeling like, but it\u2019s too much, he\u2019s lost too much. Their people are dead. A-Yuan is dead. Young Master Wei is dead. Soon, his sister will be dead too, and he\u2019ll be completely alone. He hopes whatever his sister does manages to take away his awareness along with his free will. He doesn\u2019t want to have to exist in a world like that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s better if he\u2019s not Wen Ning, if instead he\u2019s just a thing to be used.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Song Lan returns to the mountain to find things much the same as he left it. Baoshan Sanren in a coma, Wei Wuxian on the edge of dying, and Xiao Xingchen holding onto his composure by his fingertips.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been over six months since Baoshan Sanren scooped Wei Wuxian up from the bottom of a cliff and called Xiao Xingchen back to her mountain, breaking her own vow twice over. It\u2019s been more than six months since she calmly talked Xiao Xingchen through cutting open her chest and taking out her golden core to give it to Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u201cXiao Xingchen,\u201d he says, watching as his friend\u2019s face lights up in delight and relief before it crumples.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not crying but it seems more through stubbornness than a lack of desire. \u201cHe was gone for a whole day this time, nearly. I thought he wasn\u2019t coming back. He just keeps saying it\u2019s helping him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian truly doesn\u2019t understand how his carelessness with himself is a cruelty to all those who care for him. Song Lan\u2019s surety that he neither intends nor wants to hurt them is all that\u2019s keeping him from going into that room and attempting to knock some sense into him. \u201cIt is helping him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Projection his consciousness so far away, with no conduit like a paperman, and then channeling spiritual energy through it so he can affect the things around him is \u2013 laughable, almost, in its impossibility. Song Lan hadn\u2019t thought something like that could be done, even theoretically, so of course Wei Wuxian had figured out a way to do it a week after waking up.</p>\n<p>It requires massive amounts of spiritual energy. The more he does it, the more he uses, and when his spiritual energy takes a far enough dip his body is able to heal properly without tearing itself apart. It gives his body time to adjust to his new golden core. Song Lan is sure that if Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t figured out a way to expel such large amounts of spiritual energy, Baoshan Sanren\u2019s core would have killed him within the month.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting better,\u201d Song Lan says, because he is. Sometimes he even manages to walk for more than a couple minutes at a time, sometimes he can sit upright and eat and talk with them before the fever or aches pull him under again. \u201cHe\u2019s adjusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Xiao Xingchen says quietly. \u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> not enough. It\u2019s just delaying the inevitable. He\u2019s right, it is killing him, and I don\u2019t know how to stop it, and I\u2019m going to end up losing both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren isn\u2019t going to die from the golden core transfer, they think. But she will die, now. She\u2019s no longer immortal, she can no longer extend her lifespan through cultivation. She\u2019d stopped aging in her thirties, so she may be able to eke out another fifty or sixty years. If she\u2019s lucky.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen had been taken up to the mountain after Wei Wuxian\u2019s mother had left, and so little binds them together, really, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter to either of them. Xiao Xingchen cares for Wei Wuxian as if he really were family, and his distant, theoretical affection had become a solid, practical thing these past six months.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t count him out yet,\u201d he says gently. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll surprise you. I hear he\u2019s good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>His friend laughs, watery but sincere, and he hopes fiercely that Wei Wuxian manages to pull off another miracle. He doesn\u2019t want to have to help Xiao Xingchen bury someone he considers family.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Mianmian still has friends in the Jin sect, but even with help it takes months to find a way to get herself inside, to get into the bowels of Koi Tower without getting caught. It helps having a ghost for a lookout. Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t with her often, but he\u2019s here now, and she never gets quite used to the way his presence is completely undetectable to her. She should be able to sense a ghost as powerful as he is, but she can\u2019t, never knows he\u2019s there until he\u2019s nudging her shoulder or yanking on her hair.</p>\n<p>She has to fight her way through several guards, but she\u2019s always been the best, always right behind Jin Zixuan, and she fights like she never did as a Jin, desperate and dirty and uncaring of everything but her victory, of everything but moving forward.</p>\n<p>It helps that all the guards are people she\u2019d hated, arrogant and cruel, and now knowing what they\u2019d done, what they\u2019re currently doing, she can\u2019t even bring herself to feel a pang of regret.</p>\n<p>The door is sealed shut and she scowls and resists the urge to kick it like a child. She doesn\u2019t know how to get through this. If she tries to slice through wards this strong the blowback will probably kill her.</p>\n<p>Bright red spiritual energy flares in front of her, a complicated talisman drawing itself in the air before it\u2019s pushed forward. The wards fold in on themselves, crumpling and dissipating, and Mianmian is reminded of Cloud Recesses, of Wei Wuxian at fifteen casually breaking through the wards there as if they hadn\u2019t been cast by the strongest of the Lan elders.</p>\n<p>Ghosts can\u2019t manipulate spiritual energy, not like that. She feels a trickle of unease along her spine but she doesn\u2019t have time to worry about that now. She pushes the door open, finds Wen Ning and Wen Qing just like Wei Wuxian told her she would. They\u2019re filthy and confused and scared.</p>\n<p>She goes into a deep bow, ignoring their shock, and says, \u201cMy name is Luo Qingyang. I\u2019m here to help you. Please come with me, I\u2019m going to take you somewhere you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s followed Wei Wuxian this far, whatever he is now. She\u2019ll finish what she started.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has been dead for a year and Wangji is almost completely healed from his punishment, outstripping even Uncle\u2019s generous expectations.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen knows why, but says nothing. It\u2019s been a year and no one else has discovered that Wei Wuxian\u2019s ghost is lingering in Cloud Recesses, has discovered the music that still plays in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan is beginning classes. He ends every day by spending a couple hours in the Jingshi, which shouldn\u2019t be allowed, but keeping a son away from his father in seclusion is too much for him to stand. Uncle backs him up, which means the elders grumble less than they would have otherwise.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange, to watch them together. Not bad. Just different.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan sits in Wangji\u2019s lap and rests his head against his chest as he talks about his day, too high pitched and too quickly, his voice at odds against the way he lies bonelessly in Wangji\u2019s arms. He always redoes A-Yuan\u2019s hair before he leaves, not because it really needs it, but so he has a reason to take off and retie his forehead ribbon, reinforcing their relationship. Lan Xichen is their only audience, and has never questioned it even if he\u2019d wanted to, but it\u2019s not for him. It\u2019s for everyone who\u2019s manners will lapse and who will ask A-Yuan why he wears the cloud ribbon of the main family, it\u2019s so he can say, Hanguang Jun gave it to me, he ties it for me every day, and they will know.</p>\n<p>\u201cDiedie,\u201d he says, playing with the edges of Wangji\u2019s hair, and Lan Xichen can\u2019t help but stare at him in shock, \u201ccan we play outside soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji blinks one, then twice, and his lips curl up at the edges in the first true, easy smile that Lan Xichen has seen in a year. \u201cSoon,\u201d he says, which isn\u2019t the answer that A-Yuan wants, but he only pouts for a few moments before getting distracted by attempting to braid a section of Wangji\u2019s hair together.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan has never called him Diedie before. Wangji has never instructed A-Yuan to call him anything, and Lan Xichen knows that no one else would, still confused about the son that appeared just as Lan Zhan left, and even if they had, or if Uncle had gotten sentimental, then they would have instructed him to call Wangji Father, stiff and formal, just like he and his brother addressed their father.</p>\n<p>He can think of only one person who would have done this.</p>\n<p>On the way back to the children\u2019s dormitories, Lan Xichen walks with his nephew\u2019s hand in his and tries to figure out how to ask this question correctly and gives up. \u201cA-Yuan, can you tell me about your imaginary friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says cheerfully.</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about him,\u201d he says, then presses his fingers to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret! He\u2019s an imaginary secret!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an explanation that would work on anyone but him, on anyone who believes that A-Yuan really does just have an imaginary friend.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan\u2019s never brough him up to Wangji, he realizes. Never discussed him at all, with anyone, which is strange for a child as cheerful and exuberant as A-Yuan.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d he asks. Lan Xichen has never seen anything of Wei Wuxian except for the rippling of his red spiritual energy.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan comes to a stop and Lan Xichen has to pause too to prevent dragging him along behind him. \u201cZewe Jun,\u201d he says, his low, as close to reproach as he can get. He thinks he might copying Uncle, actually. \u201cI said no.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could push, could demand. But if there\u2019s anyone completely blameless in all this, it\u2019s A-Yuan. \u201cI understand,\u201d he says gently. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, satisfied, and continues walking.</p>\n<p>That night Lan Xichen presses his fingers to his guqin and plays Inquiry, calling out for Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get answer, but when he walks to the Jingshi, he hears Healing playing, even now, even when Wangji only experiences lingering soreness from the thirty three lashes that almost killed him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still here and, it seems, has nothing to say to him. Lan Xichen has no way to force him.</p>\n<p>He wonders if he should banish him, or try to, if this has gone on too long and gone too far. The problem with that is that even if he had some way to get rid of whatever type of spirit Wei Wuxian has become, it\u2019s gone on too long, gone too far.</p>\n<p>If he was going to get rid of Wei Wuxian, he should have done it a year ago, the first time he heard him play Healing. But he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>So he won\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen is not expecting to be woken in the middle of the night by Wei Wuxian. It\u2019s never happened before, and is all the more frightening because of it, because Wei Wuxian tries so hard to never ask for anything or need anything, so to have him here, now, shaking him awake, makes his heart jump to his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he rasps, reaching for Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist. \u201cAre you coughing up more blood? Has your fever spiked again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t gotten worse in the months they\u2019ve been on the mountain.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t gotten better, either. For all that the core is connected to him more firmly than ever, his body is still struggling to keep functioning. Some days Xiao Xingchen thinks he\u2019s being punished by being forced to endure witnessing the slowest, saddest death.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters, which means nothing, but his pulse is steady under his fingertips. \u201cWe have visitors at the base of the mountain. Can you go get them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVisitors,\u201d he repeats numbly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>His hands are warm on his arm, and part of that is probably his constant fever, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice is steady and sincere when he says, \u201cYou\u2019ve done such a good job taking care of me, even when you didn\u2019t have to. I know you worry. But you don\u2019t have to worry anymore. They\u2019re going to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the base of the mountain is a former Jin disciple, a fierce corpse, and Wen Qing.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing, who is alive. Wen Qing, who is the brightest medical mind of their age, who will be able to help Teacher, who might be able to save Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>He bows to her and says, \u201cPlease. I need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of stunned silence, then she says, \u201cI think that\u2019s our line, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t explain, there\u2019s no point to it, and they\u2019re silent as they climb to the top of the mountain and it\u2019s nearly dawn by the time they step into the temple. Song Lan is there, supporting Wei Wuxian as he stands at the entrance, face lit up in an eager smile.</p>\n<p>All three of them freeze. \u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d the Jin disciple whispers, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>He tries to bow and stumbles, Song Lan\u2019s hand on his elbow all that keeps him from pitching forward, but his smile is still bright when he looks at her. \u201cThank you, Mianmian. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That breaks whatever spell they\u2019re under and Wen Qing buries her face in her hands and sinks to the floor while Mianmian heads straight for Wei Wuxian, yelling at him and pulling him into a hug, and the fierce corpse that Xiao Xingchen thinks might be Wen Ning stands there with his hand outstretched and trembling.</p>\n<p>Mianmian helps him walk over to the Wens, where he takes Wen Ning\u2019s outstretched hand and drops his other hand casually onto Wen Qing\u2019s head where she\u2019s still curled on her knees. \u201cSorry it took so long,\u201d he says, the pain and regret in his voice at odds with his smile. \u201cEven after I found out you were still alive, you were hard to find.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s trembling too until Song Lan steps over to him, smiling, and says, \u201cI told you he\u2019d surprise us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen laughs, feeling lighter than he has in over a year, since Teacher found him asked for his help in cracking her open.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wen Qing had thought their sacrifice had been for nothing. They\u2019d given up their lives for their family, for Wei Wuxian, and in a cruel twist they\u2019d been only ones to come out alive. It hadn\u2019t felt like a reprieve, but a punishment, the guilt hanging heavy around her neck. But now Wei Wuxian is here, not as a ghost, having saved them <em>again</em> which threatens to make her have to hide her face away for a second time. \u00a0</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t have long to linger over the maelstrom of emotions in her chest, thankfully. She has work to do.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is dying. She\u2019s not going to let him, not when she\u2019s just gotten him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not lined up correctly,\u201d she mutters after examining Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heart, you need to connect all the veins and everything in exactly the right place otherwise it\u2019ll kill you. Nice work on trying to exhaust the core, thought. It was an extremely stupid and effective idea. Your specialty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes and she has to resist the urge to do something terrible, like hug him.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchan bows his head. \u201cI tried to follow Teacher\u2019s directions but I\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d she says, cutting him off. \u201cThey\u2019re both alive and have stayed that way. That\u2019s more than many qualified medical cultivators could have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you fix it?\u201d Luo Qingyang asks anxiously.</p>\n<p>She opens her mouth to answer, but Wei Wuxian beats her to it. \u201cOf course she can,\u201d he says. \u201cWen Qing can do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d she says, jabbing him in the side just to make him laugh as he tries to twist away from her. \u201cI can fix it,\u201d she says with more confidence than she feels.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian keeps saving her, again and again and again. She has to be able to save him too. He\u2019d say there\u2019s no debt between them and maybe there isn\u2019t, maybe they\u2019ve come too far together for that, but it doesn\u2019t matter. She refuses to do less for him than he\u2019s done for her.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s both easier and harder than the last time she\u2019d held a golden core in her hands. Easier, because she already knows all his meridian points, already knows how to connect the edges of a golden core to the rest of a body so the energy flows through it correctly and evenly. Harder, because if holding Wei Wuxian\u2019s core was like holding an inferno between palms, then Baoshan Sanren\u2019s is like holding the sun itself, blinding her and biting at her skin even as she keeps her hands steady through the pain, even as she has to feel her way around meridians she cannot see.</p>\n<p>But she knows she\u2019s succeeded when she starts to sew the wound shut and it heals on its own, all she has to do is hold the incision together and wait for it to heal over.</p>\n<p>His fever is gone and the tension of constant pain has eased out his face. He clasps her hands in his, ignoring how they\u2019re slippery with his blood, and says, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my hands in your chest twice now and there better not be a third,\u201d she snaps, but lets him continue to hold her hands, so she feels as if the effect is a bit wasted.</p>\n<p>Healing Baoshan Sanren is easy by comparison. She doesn\u2019t know if she put herself into deep medical meditation because she knew exactly what was wrong with her or if she just knew that something was wrong and figured that it would put her in a stasis until it could be stopped. It doesn\u2019t matter, because Wen Qing is here now, and she can fix it. Her golden core hadn\u2019t been taken out of her carefully enough, leading to large wounds along her spirit that were draining her of energy. They were healing, but slowly, so slowly that even over a year later they were obvious. Wei Wuxian channels his spiritual energy into her so that Wen Qing can use it to repair the tears, pulling and sewing the places together until there\u2019s nothing more to be done, until her spirit is as balanced as it can be without a golden core.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s barely finished, stepping away, when Baoshan Sanren opens her eyes. She pushes herself upright, her eyes sweeping over all of them before settling on Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you figured out how to prove your innocence yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not innocent,\u201d Wei Wuxian starts, but Wen Qing raises a hand to silence him. Shockingly, it works.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have,\u201d she says, looking to A-Ning who gives her a serious nod. All that time with Jin Guangyao, Su She, and Xue Yang experimenting on A-Ning and forcing her to help meant she knew <em>exactly</em> who was responsible for things going as disastrously wrong as they had.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren\u2019s mouth curves into a small, vicious smile and she repeats, \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren is exhausted by this cultivation conference and it\u2019s barely begun. The Jin haven\u2019t become any more tolerable with Jin Guangyao as their sect leader, no matter what Xichen seems to think, and it\u2019s not like any of the other clans are any better. Sect Leader Jiang is especially exhausting with his ire that Jin Ling is seated with his nurse next to the Jin sect leader rather than with him, as if seating the Jin sect heir with his maternal uncle would be appropriate in the current setting.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the opening banquet, everyone talking and drinking and Lan Qiren is debating how many rules of rudeness it would break if he just slipped back to his rooms and let Xichen handle this. It\u2019s not like anything important happens at the opening banquet anyway.</p>\n<p>Because the universe lives to make a fool of him, it\u2019s at that moment that the doors to the Jin hall fling themselves open to reveal Baoshan Sanren, her infamous pure white clothing and silver embroidery declaring her identity even though none of them recognize her face.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan stand at her back, and if anyone was considering doubting her identity, it\u2019s pointless now, with her known pupil there to verify it. Behind them stands Luo Qingyang and a man in all black with a mask covering his face.</p>\n<p>Everything has stopped, people cut off mid breath by her very presence. He can\u2019t help but think that all the stories Cangse Sanren had told him about her hadn\u2019t done her justice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt Lan Yi die,\u201d she starts out with an Xichen breathes in through his teeth beside him, which Lan Qiren thinks is admirable since suddenly he can\u2019t breathe at all. \u201cI felt my beloved pass on her mission to both her own decedent and, in a way, mine. Then years later I heard an interesting rumor. I heard that the Jiang sect leader had lost his golden core. I heard I had healed him.\u201d She pauses, and Lan Qiren wants to know what Jiang Wanyin\u2019s face looks like right now, but he can\u2019t bring himself to turn away. <em>He </em>hadn\u2019t heard these rumors, and he\u2019s not the one living on top of a mountain. \u201cThis was interesting, because I hadn\u2019t done any such thing, as it\u2019s impossible to heal a crushed core. Yet he had a core once more, and then my descendent went missing and returned refusing to use his sword. It was easy for me to understand what had happened.\u201d She pauses, and he thinks she knows what she means, but it can\u2019t be. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since someone successfully transferred their core to another. You must have had an excellent doctor, Sect Leader Jiang.\u201d</p>\n<p>No, that boy, giving up his golden core? Impossible, it must be, he wouldn\u2019t have done such a thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Wanyin says and Lan Qiren feels relief course through him, but when he turns, the boy is crying, his hand pressed to his chest. \u201cIf he, but, why didn\u2019t he <em>tell </em>me? <em>He</em> \u2013 that means when he fell, he couldn\u2019t heal himself, and,\u201d he stops to raise his hand and press it to his mouth, as if he\u2019s going to be sick.</p>\n<p>People said that Jiang Wanyin had had plunged his sword into his brother\u2019s chest and thrown him off the cliff\u2019s edge. Lan Qiren abruptly realizes that Jiang Wanyin himself has never said that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I figured out what he\u2019d done, I broke my vow to leave my mountain to look for him,\u201d she continues solemnly. \u201cI did not make it in time to save him from falling. I wish I had. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing left that I can do for him. The least of what he\u2019s owed is that you all acknowledge the truth of the events that lead to his destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren continues speaking, weaving a tale of manipulation and trickery that should be unbelievable except for all the ways it makes a little too much sense. Xichen face shifts to devastation while Nie Mingjue is grimly satisfied. Lan Qiren thinks it can\u2019t be true. Hopes it can\u2019t be true. Because if it was, they killed helpless refugees for nothing, they turned against Wei Wuxian for \u2013 not <em>nothing</em>, even in this version he\u2019s not blameless, but if it\u2019s true then he didn\u2019t deserve what they did, what happened to him.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019s true, then maybe Wangji really had done the right thing by trying to protect him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Baoshan,\u201d Jin Guangyao says, his voice cajoling and pleading, \u201cthis is nonsense, think of what you\u2019re saying. You have no proof, only rumor.\u201d</p>\n<p>She tilts her head to the side, something in her stance reminding him viscerally of Cangse Sanren before she\u2019d gone in for the kill. \u201cOh, did you want proof?\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>She snaps her fingers and Wen Qing walks in, her head held high, and then Wen Qionglin follows, restraining a struggling Xue Yang.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Jin Guangyao,\u201d Wen Qing says placidly, as if she\u2019s not looking at a man that has supposedly spent over a year torturing her.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing and Wen Qionglin should be dead, but they\u2019re not, standing right in front of them. If Jin Guangyao lied about this, then what else did he lie about it? If this is true, then perhaps the rest of the outlandish tale is as well.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren reaches into her robes and pulls out something that\u2019s impossible to ignore.</p>\n<p>A piece of yin iron sits in her palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cXue Yang had this on him,\u201d she says idly. \u201cSeveral things you thought were true are not. Feel free to interrogate him. He\u2019ll tell you the truth, I assume, as he\u2019s hardly the sort of type to have any loyalty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Several things happen very quickly.</p>\n<p>Jin Guangyao yanks Jin Ling out of his seat, pulls a dagger from his sleeve, and holds it to the child\u2019s throat. \u201cUncle?\u201d the toddler asks, eyes wide, not even two years old.</p>\n<p>Zidian sparks to life on Jiang Wanyin\u2019s hand, the masked man in black passes out and Luo Qingyang barely manages to catch him before he hits the ground. There\u2019s a shimmer of red spiritual energy around Jin Guangyao and the arm holding the dagger is wrenched so far backwards that they all hear a sickening snap as it folds at an unnatural angle. Jin Ling slips from his grip, but instead of falling, he\u2019s floating in the air, in a strange position as if someone\u2019s holding him on his hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Jiang Wanyin and Xichen say at the exact same time, which someone better explain immediately.</p>\n<p>Jiang and Nie disciples rush forward to subdue both Jin Guangyao and Su She. Jin Ling floats over to Jiang Wanyin, crying and reaching for him, and Jiang Wanyin takes him eagerly, holding him close and probably too tightly, but he doesn\u2019t look away from the empty space in front of him. \u201cWei Wuxian?\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone turns, because it\u2019s not coming from the space in front of Jiang Wanyin, but near the front. The man in black is standing upright again. He reaches behind him to undo the mask, letting it fall to the floor.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stands there, very much alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not find him before the fall, but I did find him after,\u201d Baoshan Sanren says blandly. \u201cAs it would have been impossible for him to survive his injuries without a golden core, I gave him one. My own. I name Wei Wuxian my heir. You will not harm him.\u201d Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan each raise an eyebrow, as if her meaning and their position could be any clearer.</p>\n<p>After the litany of shocks they\u2019ve all been through, Lan Qiren would have thought he was incapable of any more, but clearly he\u2019s mistaken. As he\u2019s been mistaken about many things.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a small consolation that Wei Wuxian looks as shocked ask the rest of them. \u201cYou \u2013 but \u2013 <em>why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren\u2019s face softens minutely. She speaks loud enough that they can all hear her, but her words are directed at Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou have done what Lan Yi always wanted to do but could not. You have figured out how to harness resentful energy in ways I did not think was possible and become a master of it. You are so young, Wei Wuxian, and you have done so much in such a small amount of time. I want you to have more time.\u201d Her smile turns wistful. \u201cLan Yi sealed herself in her cave and so I retreated to my mountain. It was enough, to share the earth with her, to know we lived under the same moon and breathed the same air. But now she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches for her then hesitates. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does,\u201d she says, not unkindly. \u201cI am very old and the woman I love is dead. A long life is nothing more than a curse to me now. I will live out the remainder of my days as a mortal woman and join A-Yi in whatever lies beyond this world. But as she left behind the Lan,\u201d Baoshan Sanren glances at him and Xichen without really seeing them, \u201cso I will leave behind you. The man who fulfilled my beloved\u2019s dreams and the son of my precious student. You are a good legacy, Wei Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren supposes that what Wei Wuxian has suffered will have to serve as penance for his crimes, as it appears that Baoshan Sanren won\u2019t allow them to take any further retribution.</p>\n<p>Considering how the sect\u2019s desire for justice had led to such a mess that Baoshan Sanren had needed to come down from her mountain to fix it, perhaps that\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ignores the chaos of the other sects to let Jiang Cheng yell at him, punch him in the shoulder, then hug him so tightly that he thinks he breaks a couple ribs. \u201cYou could at least say thank you for all the paperwork I\u2019ve done for you,\u201d he grumbles, but can\u2019t stop himself from grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he says, \u201c<em>shut up</em>, I thought I killed you, I thought \u2013 you should have told me \u2013 I think I hate you,\u201d he finishes plaintively.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d he says quietly, and thinks of their sister. He\u2019d played right into Jin Guangyao\u2019s hands and because of that Jiang Yanli is dead.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng squeezes him again then hits him upside the head. \u201cStop that. Idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s enough to make him start grinning again and for his eyes to burn. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining,\u201d he says hesitantly, \u201cbut I expected you to be \u2026 angrier.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brother is silent for a long moment, then he says, \u201cYou did do a lot of paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d he groans. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am being serious,\u201d he says, and sounds like he actually is. \u201cYou came back to Lotus Pier. That\u2019s all I wanted, was you to come back, and now you\u2019re <em>really</em> here, not just as a ghost that does my filing. I am angry. But you came home.\u201d He shrugs, a little awkwardly, and says, \u201cAs long as you come home, we can figure out the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s Wei Wuxian\u2019s turn to fling himself at his brother and hug him too tightly, but then he says, \u201cAh, about coming home, because I will, but first, I have to, um. Take care of some unfinished business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian expects an argument, but all Jiang Cheng says is, \u201cAs long as you come back.\u201d He frowns suddenly, \u201cWhat about Chenqing? It lets me hold it. I thought that meant you had to be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs and taps his brother\u2019s chest. \u201cYou have my golden core. It would probably even let you play it, if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng looks vaguely ill at the thought. \u201cNo thanks. Come grab it whenever you\u2019re done with your unfinished business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t say anything about Jiang Cheng holding his flute hostage to ensure he returns to Lotus Pier, because he\u2019s that kind of loving brother.</p>\n<p>The rest of the Jiang disciples descend on him after that, including Li Shuchun bodily throwing herself at him and not hitting him nearly as hard as he knows she\u2019s capable of, and someone finally hands him his nephew.</p>\n<p>Jin Ling seems wary of him, and he\u2019d obviously been too young to understand the concept of secrets, so Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t show himself all the times he\u2019d hovered by his crib. He starts humming the same song Jin Ling would whenever he\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night, and that\u2019s enough. Jin Ling\u2019s face lights up with recognition and he wraps his arms around his neck, it\u2019s such a good thing that he doesn\u2019t care about any sect\u2019s opinion about him because he\u2019s definitely crying again.</p>\n<p>A Jin disciple hesitantly hands him his Suibian, which he hadn\u2019t even known that Jin Guangyao had, and being able feel the familiar, welcoming thrum under his hand after so long feels just like walking back to Lotus Pier.</p>\n<p>Song Lan and Mianmian are guarding the Wens while Xiao Xingchen assists Baoshan Sanren with what could gently be called bossing all the other sects around.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fantastic. But two very important people are missing from all this.</p>\n<p>He considers just leaving, but there are couple of things that have to be cleared up first.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren and Lan Xichen are standing next to each other, which is quite convenient, although he thinks it might have something to do with Lan Xichen having some sort of crisis over Jin Guangyao, which he thinks he\u2019ll be able to feel more sympathetic about later, when the man\u2019s actions against him don\u2019t feel so fresh. Surprisingly, it\u2019s Lan Xichen who\u2019s glaring at him but he had spent quite a long time running around Cloud Recesses while pretending to be a ghost, which has to break some sort of rule. Plus he\u2019d broken his tea set. Lan Qiren is just resigned, which is a sight that he never thought he\u2019d see.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan\u2019s punishment is over,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Qiren says, more quickly than he\u2019d expected. \u201cI believe that\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou let Wangji think you were dead,\u201d Lan Xichen says tightly.</p>\n<p>He almost points out that considering he\u2019s spent every night since waking up after the events of the Nightless city with Lan Zhan\u2019s grief he\u2019s more than aware of it, but bites his tongue. This is anger born out of Lan Xichen\u2019s love of Lan Zhan, so it\u2019s not an anger he can begrudge. \u201cBaoshan Sanren\u2019s core was put in my incorrectly. It\u2019s fixed now, but that\u2019s recent. I was dying. If I didn\u2019t have a very skilled doctor, I would be dead. Would you have him mourn me a second time?\u201d He gives Lan Xichen a moment for his expression to go even stormier before adding, \u201cIf you thought having me and losing me again would be good for him, you would have told him I was there, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>That gives him pause, and some of the anger drains away. \u201cA-Yuan?\u201d</p>\n<p>That hurts more, but he says, \u201cKids grow out of imaginary friends all the time. He\u2019s already forgotten me once, what\u2019s one more? But Lan Zhan would know. He\u2019d remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen nods in acknowledgement, which is probably all he\u2019s going to get, but that\u2019s all he needs.</p>\n<p>Outside of Koi Tower, Wei Wuxian steps onto Suibian and flies to Gusu.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a nice day, a chill on the breeze that\u2019s easily overshadowed by the sun\u2019s warmth, winter being firmly inched out by spring. The Jingshi\u2019s doors are wide open while A-Yuan plays outside. He has a book in his lap, but he\u2019s not really reading it. It\u2019s a good day. He\u2019ll have plenty more good days.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan runs his hand over the cover of one of his favorite books and tells himself that a life of simple pleasures is not a bad life.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaba!\u201d A-Yuan screams.</p>\n<p>He jerks, the book falling to the floor as he rises and hurries outside. He doesn\u2019t sound hurt, but the strange form of address worries him. A-Yuan has never called him that before.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s someone hugging his son, a man in black, with his head bent and he summons Bichen to his hands without thinking. \u201cGet away from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the man raises his head, smiling, and this isn\u2019t a dream, isn\u2019t a confusing moment between sleep and wakefulness, but somehow Wei Ying is here.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan gasps and clasps his hands over his mouth before lowering them and whispering, \u201cSorry, Baba, I know it\u2019s a secret.\u201d He frowns pressing his hands against Wei Ying\u2019s arm, his eyebrows pulling together in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re warm!\u201d He glances uncertainly back at him, and he says, \u201cBaba, I think Diedie can see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he can too,\u201d he says, dropping a kiss on top of A-Yuan\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not a secret anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yuan beams and leaves Wei Ying\u2019s embrace to run over to him, grabbing his hand and tugging on it impatiently. \u201cDiedie, come on, come here, Baba\u2019s home!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d he asks, faintly noticing the way his voice cracks in the middle.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan stop tugging on him, frowning uncertainly. \u201cDiedie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, A-Yuan,\u201d Wei Ying says, stepping closer. He sounds like Wei Ying. He moves like Wei Ying. His hand covers Lan Zhan\u2019s, carefully lowering Bichen, which he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d still been holding, and he feels like Wei Ying. \u201cPut the sword away, maybe, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He opens his hands, letting it drop, then twist his hand so his fingers are intertwined with Wei Ying\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d A-Yuan whispers, tugging at his robe. \u201cDiedie, don\u2019t be sad, Baba\u2019s really nice, you\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sad?</p>\n<p>Wei Ying cups his face to run a calloused thumb over his cheek and he shudders at the contact. \u201cYou\u2019re crying, Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he breathes, and wants to close his eyes, but terrified that if he does this will all disappear. \u201cWei Ying, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d he says, then laughs, and he never thought he\u2019d hear Wei Ying laugh again, but he\u2019s here and he\u2019s laughing and Lan Zhan is touching him. \u201cYou missed a really interesting cultivation conference. The short of it is Baoshan Sanren saved my life, but I was,\u201d he glances down at his son, at their son, and amends what he was going to say to, \u201csick. For a long time, and I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to come back. So I waited, just in case I stayed sick and \u2026 had to leave again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sick now?\u201d he asks, and it\u2019s so hard to keep himself under control, to keep the happiness and hope and grief and fear from coming out all at once. Worry prickles along his skin, but Wei Ying looks healthy, healthier than he\u2019d looked before the Sunshot Campaign, but he understands the things that Wei Ying isn\u2019t saying.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m good, I\u2019m,\u201d he pauses, a rueful smile curling around his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to have to worry all that much about being sick, actually\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never worried about being sick,\u201d he says. Wei Ying laughs again. Lan Zhan wants to live in in Wei Ying\u2019s laugh, wants to bottle it, wants to swallow it. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says, rubbing his thumb along Lan Zhan\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cI mean, I was in the mountains trying not to,\u201d another glance at A-Yuan, \u201cstay sick, but I was here too.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t make any sense, but then Wei Ying hums the opening notes to Healing and Wei Ying ends up having to wrap an arm around his waist to keep him from sliding to the ground, but they end up there anyway, he and Wei Ying on their knees in front of each other while A-Yuan leans against Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder and looks at him in concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was real?\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying reaches out and runs his hand through his hair, the motions familiar, feeling like it had always felt in his dreams. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. If I\u2019d known I wasn\u2019t going to stay sick, I wouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret, it\u2019s just that for so long I was sure that I was going to have to leave you again. But I was here, I was always here. I sat by you every night, Lan Zhan. I played for you and tried to take care you as well as I could.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>He shifts to try and hide his face in Wei Ying\u2019s hand. He thinks the happiness in his chest might be winning out over the grief, he thinks Wei Ying\u2019s skin against his own means he\u2019s real.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to kiss?\u201d A-Yuans asks and he freezes. \u201cJingyi\u2019s parents kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying grins, something uncertain in his expression, \u201cThe kid makes a good point. Can I kiss you, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t answer, but he does pull Wei Ying practically into his lap to tip his face up and kiss him, chaste and shuddering because their son is in front of them, but Wei Ying is alive, Wei Ying is here.</p>\n<p>A life of moments just like these is a good life, and now it\u2019s a life that he gets to have.</p>"
