  "text": "<p>Everyone knew Izuku Midoriya was observant. That wasn't a secret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But some people just failed to realize really how observant he was, and Izuku himself just failed to realize how absolutely creepy it came off whenever he knew things about people that he most definitely wasn't supposed to know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, Midoriya knew absolutely everything about everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every hero he'd met, if only for 4 whole minutes, he already knew a lot more about them than the press even did. His classmates, he knew too well, but that just comes from living with them. The same can be said about his teachers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, people just thought he was observant when it came to Quirks, but what they missed was that of course he was analytical in general if he could pinpoint someone's weakness or drawback relating their Quirk with just a look at their Quirk in action.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yeah, maybe he was just examining people's Quirks at first. Then he realized the other info he could get on people was maybe worth remembering as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For pro heroes at least, he decided to put his knowledge to good use, and so it started. Many historians would look back and refer to this as:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Hero Wikipedia revolution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And really, it was merely by chance anyone even realized this started happening. One doesn't exactly uses Wikipedia to look up real people anymore unless you have to make a paper on them for some reason or you're one of those weirdos that memorize their favorite hero or actor's Wikipedia, even when there's a 2% chance ever of you actually using the knowledge of where the hell did Nicky Minaj grew up and went to school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the very person who had realized this was none other than Kaminari Denki, who was really set on doing his English homework until he started to get stuck, which led to his mind wondering why was Mic so good at English, which lead to Denki questioning whether any other of his teachers ever went to America, which ended up with him thinking about American food, which ended up with him wondering if All Might liked hot dogs. And instead of waiting to ask his teacher that in heroics class, Denki simply Googled it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And surprisingly enough, All Might's Wikipedia page was particularly filled with very personal information.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From his favorite food (which, according to Wikipedia, it was plain ass boiled eggs and green tea, and really, who was Denki to doubt our lord Wikipedia?) to, surprisingly, the length on his arms and legs in muscular and skinny form, and weirdly enough, also what his hair tasted like? That last one was definitely creepy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So of course, Denki did the logical thing and ditched his homework in favor of checking the Wikipedia pages of the rest of his teachers. Another thing is that normally Denki hated Wikipedia. The formatting alone made it so his eyes hurt and his brain would black out every three sentences. But he was pleased to find the paragraphs were nicely separated instead of all just put together, with pretty colors for different things and lists here and there. It was refreshing to see a Wikipedia page that didn't look like a single, very intimidating block of info out for Kaminari's blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he kept on his journey of going into the 'extra details' section of his teacher's Wikipedia pages, finding they were all weirdly personal and specific, some more juicy than others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently, Midnight was ambidextrous and liked her coffee with a lot of sugar and milk. Oh, and she also had an OnlyFans (although according to Wikipedia, it was nothing explicit) and used to run a Mistress business when she first started as a hero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cementoss was known was a heartbreaker back in highschool, and apparently he was a fan of dogs and owned a Golden Retriever that used to think he was a street lamp or something and would attempt to go to the bathroom on him when they were a puppy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vlad was a fan of cooking, and more often than not, would ask his class to test try some of his dishes (Now that was just unfair, maybe they had Sato to cook them delicious desserts and Bakugo, who more often than not was in charge of cooking, but it was their teacher giving 1B probably delicious food! Meanwhile Aizawa seemed like he only ever consumed juice pouches).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Excited for his discovery, he took his laptop and stormed downstairs, where a lot of his classmates had gathered to watch a movie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had tried to stay, but Bakugo, apparently the Bakusquad mom, fully aware of the fact that Denki was the only one who hadn't done his homework yet sent him to his room to do it and basically banned him from movie night until he got his shit done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily for him, Bakugo was in the kitchen, apparently cooking something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The movie was already over though, so now everyone was just calmly chatting. That is, until Denki practically slammed his laptop on the table, looking like an over excited puppy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Guys, you won't believe what I found!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh, hey dude.\" Kirishima greeted him. \"Thought you were doing your homework?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki dismissed him with a wave of his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Not the point, bro! Look!\" he turned his laptop so that everyone would see it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Why are we looking at the Wikipedia page of one of our teachers?\" Jirou asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay okay, so don't ask how, but suddenly I was just wondering if All Might likes hot dogs\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"As one does.\" Sero nodded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"... So I decided to look it up, and bam! His Wikipedia page is incredibly detailed. It even says what his hair tastes like.\"</p>\n<p>\"Bullshit!\" Mina said immediately, grabbing Denki's computer to double check what he said. She seemed to find it, because she looked up, a haunted look on her face. \"What the fuck do you mean it tastes like a 'musky banana'? What does that even mean?...\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jirou was next to steal the laptop, apparently browsing through the other open tabs with Wikipedia pages on their other teachers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Why are all of these so weirdly specific?\" she asked. \"Like, why do they know how tall is Present Mic's hair when up?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I don't know, but it's cool! They're all super random.\" Kirishima said, peeking over Jirou's shoulder to look at Thirteen's Wikipedia page. \"Oh, Thirteen sensei's favorite show! I've watched that too, it's good.\"</p>\n<p>\"I wonder who even wrote this\u2026\" Denki made a thinking face, as if that would actually help him think at all.</p>\n<p>\"Dunce face, you better finished your homework or I swear I'll kill you!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki jumped, running out of the common area just as Bakugou excited the kitchen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Hey, you forgot your laptop!\" Kirishima called after him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Leave it, he doesn't need it to do his homework. It would just distract him again.\" Bakugou growled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shrugging, Kirishima went back to check the Wikipedia page over Jirou's shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the author of said Wikipedia pages sat there at the other couch, oblivious to it all as he scribbled down some of his new info on his teachers to update the Wikipedia pages later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The few of the class that had been alerted of this by Kaminari spread the word of the weirdly specific Wikipedia pages, and soon it reached the other first years, and eventually, the teachers and rest of the school as well. So here they were now, with Mic sensei complaining that multiple students had given him bananas throughout the week after learning from his Wikimedia page he hated the fruit thanks to how often he got compared to one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Shota, it's hell!\" he kept complaining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I don't care.\" he answered as he kept walking towards his classroom, in hopes Mic would eventually give up on complaining and following him since classes were about to start.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But no, Mic had to go and follow him even to his classroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mic, out. You have class.\"</p>\n<p>\"... And I just don't know how they even learned that!\" He kept on venting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, time to pull out the big guns then. Aizawa looked around, noticing most of his students were already in the classroom, and he approached Mic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mic, come with me to the hallway. Now.\" he dropped his voice so only he could hear him \"... Or the cats are taking over your spot on the bed tonight.\"</p>\n<p>That finally worked, and Mic obediently followed him out into the hallway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka, who was one of the students already present, watched the interaction with curious eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Huh\u2026 Aizawa sensei really always knows how to get Mic sensei to listen to him.\"</p>\n<p>Next to her, Deku giggled. \"Of course he does, he's his husband after all.\"</p>\n<p>Every single head turned to look at Deku, who looked surprised at the reaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"How do you know that?\" Shinso asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Uh\u2026 It's obvious?\" he answered \"Really, I thought everyone knew\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"But they don't have wedding rings!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mic sensei does, actually. His gloves hide it tho. And Aizawa sensei wears his on a chain, I've seen him fiddle with it when he thinks no one is paying attention. Also they're very close, so when I noticed the rings and how they act I just put it together\u2026 \" Midoriya further explained himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki, who had arrived merely moments before Uraraka's statement, made a thinking face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I don't remember seeing anything about them being married in their Wikipedia pages\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jirou nodded, further supporting his statement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yes! It said some other very personal things, but nothing about them being married\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya, again, looked surprised. And even kind of embarrassed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You've read those? Ah, well, I didn't put any information about them being married because I figured that's not public knowledge, so I didn't want to put anything about that in, just in case.\"</p>\n<p>Again, there was a pause. Then, the classroom erupted into different shouts of surprise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You wrote those!?\" Denki screamed over the chaos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I, um, yes? I didn't think anyone would read it, and please don't tell sensei! I think he might not like it that I spend my free time doing that.\"</p>\n<p>But before he could get an answer, the door slammed open, and in walked Aizawa again, eyes red and hair up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"The bell rang already, shut up and sit down.\"</p>\n<p>And sure enough, 5 seconds later everyone was quiet and sitting down on their respective places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn't ask what all the fuzz had been about because quite honestly, he'd been through it before, and after many failed attempts at understanding just what the hell was going on with his students now, he finally gave up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, he noticed changes. Like how every time Mic would come into the classroom or he'd mention him in a lecture, some of his students would giggle and exchange knowing glances. Or how some seemed to treat Midoriya as if he was some sort of king now (and by some, he meant Mina, Kirishima, Kaminari, Uraraka, Hagakure and to some extent also Jirou). He didn't investigate. Because he did not get paid enough to deal with this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, no one can really blame him for being curious about the Wikipedia page Mic mentioned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And well, as the saying goes, 'curiosity killed the cat'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was convinced it would not be accurate. How could it, when he was not on the public's eye? Hizashi's page could've been a coincidence, someone over analyzing hours upon hours of interviews and his radio show. The same could be said about his colleagues, who were also public heroes, unlike him. And anyone who did enough digging could find Midnight's Only Fans very easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So imagine his surprise when he opened his Wikipedia page to find a lot of very random, yet personal facts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like the common size of his eye bags, what he was allergic to, that tabby and black cats were his favorites, or also weirdly enough, the size of his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was so random, it was probably even off, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>It was off by half and inch. Half.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Count him down as officially terrified of how much info this person had on him, but there was also one thing clear: it had to be a student or a teacher. Students were the only ones, besides his colleagues, that could possibly know so much about him. And there was only one student analytical enough to be able to have all that information on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Actually, scratch that, there are only two people in the entirety of the school capable of that level of analysis on anyone, one of them a student and the other, the principal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He'd had to do some digging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shoto had more or less earned himself a reputation around the dorm rooms as the local conspiracy theorist. And he wouldn't necessarily call it conspiracy theories, he was just seeing what no one else did. It was just like Deku with his analysis and Wikipedia pages, but while Deku was the one who noticed details such as how long were Aizawa Sensei's arms or how large, in average, were his eye bags, Shoto was the one who noticed other details and put puzzle pieces together to form a picture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So he was definitely surprised the day Midoriya knocked on his dorm room, a white board on his tail as he entered the room. The board was covered in writing and had multiple pieces of red yarn connecting everything together. Shoto was familiar, his own conspiracy board sat at the corner of his room, currently displaying his newest theory: 'Are Monoma and Toga related?'\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya entered the room, put the board in place, and turned to look at him right as Shoto read the title of this board: 'Is Dabi Touya Todoroki?'\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"My brother is dead.\" Shoto said immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya hummed, tapping the board with the tip of his closed marker. \"Is he, though? Todoroki, this is an intervention, because I can't believe that you, a conspiracy theorist at heart, haven't figured this out by yourself.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki didn't know what to answer to that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya grinned. \"Alright, so, exhibit A: eyes.\" he pointed at the part of the board labeled 'Exhibit A' along with a closeup, blurry picture of Dabi's eyes. \"His eyes are the same color as Endeavor's and yours on your left side. Exhibit B: from the records I was able to access and what your sister said when we had dinner at your place, your brother's fire was hotter than Endeavor's, but it hurt him to use it. Dabi is covered in burn marks and his fire is blue, which is proved to be hotter than regular fire. Why would a fire user be covered in burns if he's supposed to be fire resistant?\" he said, this time pointing at the corresponding part of the board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"But\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm not done yet, and your scar is not from the water, but the fact that probably someone applied ice to the burn.\" Midoriya cut him off, pointing at the next section. \"Exhibit C: Your brother should be around 24-25 years old now, and Dabi is estimated to be around that age as well.\" he pointed at the next section, probably Shoto's favorite since it had a picture of Endeavor marked with a huge red X. \"Exhibit D: his grudge against Endeavor seems personal, he doesn't look like he just hates him for being number one. Exhibit E: I took the picture from your brother's obituary, ran it through some photoshop, and bam.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pointed to a picture of Touya, probably the same as the one they had at the altar back home, now with black hair and Dabi's signature scars that looked rather eerie in a 14 year old.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Exhibit F: I did the same with a picture and Dabi.\" this time, he pointed at a picture of Dabi, with photoshopped white hair and without his scars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, well, damn did that look like Touya.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoriki could have gotten mad. He could have been relieved to find he was alive, he was feeling so many things in that moment. And instead, what came out of his mouth was:</p>\n<p>\"Mom will be pissed Touya hasn't visited her.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya nodded solemnly, apparently happy that Todoroki had finally understood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi was naturally a secretive person. No one knew where he came from or who he actually was, and he was set on letting it be like that for as long as he could, and he was certain no one would ever even be able to put the puzzle pieces of his real identity together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was until he met the green haired boy who turned into his paralysis demon. He was absolutely terrifying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day went to shit pretty fast, as what would have been a regular day for Dabi at his usual spot to take a smoke started to go wrong when it turned out a bunch of dudes beat him there and tried to corner a girl. He was ready to burn them alive, blue fire ready to incinerate them when the literal devil entered the scene.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This feral hero student gremlin beat the pervs to a pulp so fast, Dabi didn't even have time to turn away and vanish before the absolute feral child's gaze was set on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl ran away after a hurried thanks, apparently as fearful of being in the receiving end of the green gaze as Dabi was now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then the green menace said:</p>\n<p>\"Hey, Todoroki-kun. I was hoping to come across you soon.\"</p>\n<p>Dabi did not feel a chill go down his spine, absolutely not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What did you just call me?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You're right, that's confusing, I call your brother the same\u2026\" he waved a hand around, apparently not noticing he was still literally standing on top of one of the pervs unconscious body. \"Can I call you Touya then?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi did not panic, absolutely not. It's not like hearing him being addressed by his old name triggered his fight or flight instincts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Alright, so, Touya, you should go visit your mom! She will be pissed you didn't visit her all this time you actually were alive. Don't worry, your brother already asked for you to be put into the list of people who can go see her, just tell them you're Touya.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm not whoever you think I am.\" Midoriya gave him the most deadpan look ever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Sure, right, I believe you. But hypothetically speaking, if you were Todoroki Touya, you should go visit her, unless\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Unless?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Unless you want every news site to know who you actually are by tonight. I'm guessing you have this big, dramatic reveal saved for Endeavor and the public, right? School records said you were in the drama club, of course you have something planned. Anyway, you try to attract me or don't go visit your mother, I have a file pre saved already with all the evidence, including a recording of this conversation that will be automatically uploaded there, and if something happens to me or you haven't visited the hospital by Friday, Todoroki-kun has access to the file and will upload it immediately.\"</p>\n<p>And then, as if he just hadn't made an incredibly effective threat to end the thing he's worked so hard to build, the kid actually fucking smiled to Dabi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"So, it's up to you, Touya!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he jumped down the perv's back, happily skipping out of the alleyway, but stopping just for a second to turn to look at Dabi once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm calling in an anonymous tip to the cops so they can come pick them up, so I'd suggest you leave now unless you want to get arrested. Oh, and good luck with Rei-san!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he was gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi left the place soon after that, deciding he needed to get a new spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And if he showed up at the hospital in disguise the very next day, it was no one's business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks prided himself on being a very reserved and secretive person. He had to be, considering his job and his training. The Hero Commission had trained him to be an exceptional liar, to never let any special info slip, never take off his mask in public and let anyone see the real him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this? This was something he was not prepared for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He'd run into Midoriya himself only once before, and had heard of the boy once or twice from his intern every time he was talkative enough to actually share some bits of information about his life in the dorms with his very chaotic classmates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks knew about the Wikipedia pages. At this point, everyone knew.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually, a kid from UA had posted about it on their Twitter, which quickly became popular, so now everyone knew about the mysterious author of the Wikipedia pages that were weirdly personal and accurate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His, although competing against Eraser's with how short it was compared to the ones of other pro heroes, was still very much detailed, which was scary to say the least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His love for chicken wasn't exactly a secret, or his side job as a model, but other things were, such as how he actually hated when people touched his wings without his consent, and surprisingly enough, it said he'd undergone 'special training' by the Hero Commission, although it didn't went into detail, but the way it was phrased made it seem as shady as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Needless to say, Hawks got an earful of the Commission's president telling him how incompetent he'd been to let information like that slip. He had to bite his tongue to avoid a retort about how incompetent she'd been that a random person on the internet at least managed to find some info into his training program.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His real name was not on the Wikipedia page, which Hawks was grateful for. Although the author made it clear they knew it, they made a note saying that since Hawks didn't seem like he liked his name, they would avoid mentioning it out of respect for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And really, it wasn't all so bad, since now some people at least had the decency to ask first if they could touch his wings. He still wanted to say no, but with the Commission breathing down his neck now more than ever and insisting he took care of his public image, he just had to say yes every time. But at least it felt nice to have people asking for once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, some people even held back from touching them at all now, which was incredibly nice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He'd always had his wings being touched by civilians without consent, and it bothered him a lot since it made him feel more like an object than a person, so he was more than grateful for the change.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wasn't expecting to meet the mysterious person behind what made that possible for him, but he did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He'd been called in to UA to help supervise a class, something about one of the strongest heroes inspiring the baby hero students to get stronger and surpass their limits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He'd accepted mainly because his sidekicks insisted he needed a day off, and also because he could use the opportunity to check on his intern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class went by smoothly, the students soon leaving the gym all starry eyed and excited from having met him, when the green haired little genius approached him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Hawks-san, I was hoping I could ask you for a favor.\"</p>\n<p>Thinking it was probably something to do with the past class, he beamed at him. \"Sure eyas! Not sure I can absolutely help you with whatever it is, but shoot.\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you pass along a message to To\u2014sorry, you know him as Dabi. Could you?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks blinked slowly. Once, then twice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, what was that, eyas?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh, you know, since you're infiltrating the League and are Dabi's boyfriend.\"</p>\n<p>Hawks forced himself to laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I have no idea of what you're talking about here, Greeny-chan.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hawks-san, it's fine, I found the file from your mission when I hacked into the Commission's database. Although I didn't see anything in there about you playing honey trap with Dabi\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were so many things wrong with that statement, starting with the fact that the kid had apparently hacked into the database of a government institution like it was nothing, and following with the fact that not only did he know about his thing with Dabi, but he also knew for some reason what a honey trap was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay, backtrack, you did what!?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I said it's fine.\" he dismissed him with a wave of his hand. \"It started because I was gathering information from different pros and Hero Commission officials for the Wikipedia pages, but I ended up seeing some shady stuff and\u2026 Yeah. By the way, I'm putting together a portfolio with all the evidence from your training and stuff, it's pretty solid, not even a very biased judge would be able to deny it, in case you want to take this to court.\"</p>\n<p>Yeah, Hawks was completely lost now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Anyway, that's not the point! Could you please tell Dabi that I know he hasn't visited his mom in a while? Just tell him that, please. He'll know what it means.\"</p>\n<p>Okay, cryptic much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Uh\u2014 sure, I'll tell him.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya beamed. \"Thank you, Hawks-san!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was about to turn around and leave when Hawks stopped him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Hey, eyas, did you say you were gathering information for the Wikipedia pages?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh, um, yeah! It's really nothing\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"So you're the one behind that.\" Hawks cut him off. \"Well\u2026 I guess I should thank you, the Commission didn't take it well, but at least people are nicer about touching my wings straight away now.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya cringed. \"I'm sorry, I didn't think they would find out and.\"</p>\n<p>\"It's fine, but how did you know about my wings anyway?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh, I just noticed that in videos you always seem uncomfortable or flinch just a little bit every time anyone touches them. It's not too noticeable, I barely could tell at all, and also there was a couple of interviews where you mentioned your wings are like a couple of extra arms, they're a part of your body, so I figured I wouldn't like it to have people randomly coming up to me and touching my arms without my consent\u2026 \"</p>\n<p>Hawks hummed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What about the\u2026 Dabi thing?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"That was easy as well, and it was mainly because of To\u2014eh, Dabi. I already knew you were supposed to get into the League and Dabi was your contact thanks to the files from the Commission, but I put it together because of him. I just so happen to come across him often, and I noticed his demeanor changes whenever you come up into the conversation, and at the start I just figured you were good friends, but then I noticed he acts almost like Mic sensei does talking about Aizawa sensei, so I figured there was something else.\"</p>\n<p>What exactly did that mean, Hawks did not want to know. His relationship with Dabi was complicated, and he wouldn't go as far as to say they were boyfriends, more like friends (were they friends, even?) with benefits. More benefits than anything, really. But he was not about to explain that to a high-school boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You're\u2026 Very smart.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked surprised, as if he genuinely wasn't expecting a compliment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Thanks.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'll pass along your message. Even if it implies that you know who Dabi is and have not alerted authorities.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya shrugged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Your boyfriend was a part of the drama club of his school, I told him before, but I'm sure he's planning a dramatic reveal or something. I won't take that away from him\u2026 Unless he stops visiting his mom, then I definitely will.\"</p>\n<p>Hawks was also not about to admit it, but hearing someone refer to Dabi as Hawks' boyfriend did something to his poor chicken heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I knew there was a reason for why he was so dramatic! Blackmailing him about being a good soon? Okay, sure, keep it up. And Greenie-chan\u2026\" he hesitated for a moment, but finally said. \"I'll tell Tsukoyomi to give you my number. Call me when you have that portfolio ready, will you?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I will!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks came home exhausted, not surprised at all to find a pair of boots sitting by his balcony door and a very familiar villain lounging on his couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Had fun with the mini heroes?\" Dabi asked, not looking up from his phone as Hawks let himself fall to the couch next to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And maybe he started telling Dabi he was propense to get cold very easily as an excuse to use him as his personal heather, but either way, he didn't complain when Hawks nuzzled to his side like a puppy craving attention and heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I guess. One of them asked me to pass along a message for you.\"</p>\n<p>That seemed to interest Dabi as he looked up from his phone, and eyebrow as a silent question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It was this kid, Midoriya. He asked me to tell you he knows you haven't visited your mom in a while. What's that about?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>To say Dabi looked considerably paler the second he heard the name and the message of the UA student was an understatement. He had a haunted look on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"... Dabs?\"</p>\n<p>He didn't answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shigaraki was always considered an odd person. For starters, yes, he was indeed one of those weirdos with a tendency to memorize every single detail from the Wikipedia page of people he deemed important (mainly, One for All and All Might).\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when the whole Wikipedia page thing started happening, he went down a rabbit whole of memorizing pages upon pages of different heroes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Toga, who somehow caught onto this, decided to turn it into a game. For once, Shigaraki didn't complain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What type of wood is Kamui Woods' body con\u2026 Compt\u2026\" Toga frowned, handing over her card at Compress, who sighted but took it anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Composed of.\" Compress finished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Cedar wood.\" Shigaraki answered immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twice cheered, writing down another point for him on the wall from the hideout they had decided to use as a board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What difference is there between that and other wood?\" Toga asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No fucking idea, next question.\"</p>\n<p>Toga flipped to the next card, about to read it when Spinner broke into the room, a laptop with a cracked screen on hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"We have Wikipedia pages too!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Toga instead squealed, causing Shigaraki to get startled and dust yet another piece of the counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She didn't pay him any mind as she skipped over to Spinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"We have our own!? Let me see!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so Dabi came in around an hour later, with the League all reunited around the shitty laptop and some giggling to themselves. They looked up when he walked in, Toga snickering upon seeing him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Look, it's the bad son!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"The fuck did you called me?\" he snarled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shigaraki scratched his neck, still looking at the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Have some fucking manners, Dabi.\"</p>\n<p>\"Like you're one to talk, handjob.\"</p>\n<p>Compress shook his head in faked disappointment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I can't believe you don't visit your mother that often, Dabi.\"</p>\n<p>\"What the fuck are you on?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Dude, it's on your Wikipedia page.\" Spinner said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Give me that, you poor excuse of a Stain Cosplayer.\" Dabi grabbed the device, various tabs open with different Wikipedia pages for each member of the League.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The went on to his, rapidly going through it until he found what they were talking about, in the section for 'additional, random facts':</p>\n<p>-Dabi dyes his hair black, but according to my sources, his hair is actually currently white, although the coloration was different when he was a kid, it's assumed he suffered from Marie Antoinette syndrome, as it was also the case with Shigaraki Tomura.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-His body can stand temperatures below zero with incredible ease, and can stand being in the cold for longer and degrees lower than the average person can be able to stand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-He has a significant other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-He is a bad son who doesn't visits his mother often enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh, that little shit, I visited her yesterday, and he knows that, the snitch I have as a little brother gives him weekly reports on me\u2026!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>From that day on, jokes about him being a terrible son and dying his hair black 'just for the emo aesthetic' were often everything he would hear as soon as he stepped foot into the League's headquarters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks didn't question it when Dabi started to visit his place even more often.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mount Lady was not having a great day. Truly, she had not been having any good days since everyone discovered that Wikipedia page and started asking way too many questions every time she was in public. Interviews after the job were her favorite part of the day, but now\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mount Lady, is it true you got stuck into your giant form for 3 weeks as a kid?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Is it true you need to have pads especially made so they grow with you?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Is it true you are from a farm in a small town?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026 She was miserable, all thanks to whoever it was that decided to write all of those very revealing, personal info into her Wikipedia page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Best Jeanist was a very patient man. Incredibly so, but when it came to the paparazzi, they really tested his patience. More so after the Wikipedia pages went viral on the internet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Best Jeanist, why did you deny the sponsorship by Levi's?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Is it true you are just insecure about your face?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Is it true you're a robot?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, that last one wasn't in his Wikipedia page, more like it was a very popular theory by some user named @Iceicebaby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for Endeavor, he usually didn't cared about such trivial things, but when his PR representative stormed into his office, too rattled to even care, he knew something was wrong. His Wikipedia page was totally a disaster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Starting with the fact that the author didn't hide his feelings towards him by constantly talking about him in a despective way, proceed to pull out full statistics about his damage control to public property and civilian casualties, pointing out how not even All Might had such high numbers, and finishing it off by casually mentioning none of his children really liked to be a around him, insinuate there were documents to prove he had been involved in a Quirk marriage, and also insinuate he was overall abusive towards his family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So of course, he was anything but happy when his popularity suddenly dropped after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Classes were finally over for the students of the hero course as they all happily went out of their classroom to enjoy the rest of their day lazing around the dorms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa spotted the green hair amongst his students, and said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Midoriya, a word.\"</p>\n<p>Kaminari patted him in the shoulder, whispering 'Nice knowing you, dude'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka wished him luck. Tsuyu just shrugged.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally the classroom was left empty except for Aizawa and Deku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You wanted to talk, Aizawa sensei?\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya asked, fidgeting with his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yes. Would you care to tell me if you know anything about the Wikipedia pages everyone is talking about?\" Aizawa asked, arms crossed over his chest as he seemed to stare into his own student's soul.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"W-Wikipedia pages? I don't\u2014Um, I don't think I know just what you mean, sensei. I mean, I've heard of them, but I just, I've never, at least I don't think\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Midoriya.\" Aizawa cut him off. \"You're not a good liar, kid. Drop it, I know it's you behind those.\"</p>\n<p>Deku suddenly looked as if he'd seen a ghost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I-I see. Are you going to punish me or something?...\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa sighted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You know the information in those can be deadly if it falls into the hands of a villain, right?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I left out all of the information villains could use in a fight!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Did you?\" Aizawa retorted. \"Midoriya, you never know what kind of information is useful for a villain or not. They don't play fair, even knowing what you're allergic to could be used to kill you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"But I'll admit, most information there is useless anyway. I talked to principal Nezu, and he actually encouraged this, said it's beneficial to your abilities to analyze an enemy like that. So instead, Nezu would like it to install a club of sorts, where you will be teaching your classmates and 1B how to analyze a person like that.\"</p>\n<p>\"What!?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You're starting in two weeks, have something prepared by then.\"</p>\n<p>Aizawa turned around, walking out of the classroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Wait, Aizawa sensei-!\" and he was already gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That definitely didn't go as expected.</p>\n<p>And that was how Midoriya's extreme fanboy tendencies ended up reuniting a bad son with his mother, exposing both Endeavor and the Hero Commission for child abuse, making him go viral on the internet, and causing for his classmates to technically end up gaining an extra class that no one was really all that happy about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
