  "text": "<p>It starts with a leak.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you reported it to the residential manager?\u201d Lan Wangji asks when he comes back from class, and notices the bucket Wei Wuxian has placed on his bed to catch the leaking water. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says morosely. \u201cBut she said they won\u2019t be able to fix it until Monday at the earliest!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, apparently satisfied with just knowing that the leak will be fixed, completely uncaring of Wei Wuxian\u2019s wellbeing or his current situation at all. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian groans. \u201cLan Zhan, what am I supposed to do until Monday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji eyes the bucket. \u201cWork around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pouts at him. And then perks up as an idea comes to him. \u201cWhat if-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even heard me out yet,\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles, but dutifully keeps his bright idea to himself. </p>\n<p>He was going to ask if Lan Wangji would take pity on him and let him share his bed for the next two nights, but knowing Lan Wangji, there's no chance that he will actually agree to it without Wei Wuxian having to pester him into it for the next few hours. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s taken Wei Wuxian a whole semester to see through Lan Wangji\u2019s stoic facade and recognise him for the big softy he actually is, but Wei Wuxian <i>knows him</i> now, and he is not above using it to his advantage. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan <i>er-gege</i>,\u201d he says sweetly instead, \u201cyou haven\u2019t had dinner yet, have you? Wen Ning texted me earlier to say that they have your favourite three-colour steamed eggs at the cafeteria tonight.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji eyes him briefly, and Wei Wuxian beams at him to try to assuage Lan Wangji\u2019s suspicions. He\u2019s not sure it works very well, but he\u2019s also not too worried because he knows Lan Wangji will end up saying yes anyway.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji picks up his keys. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cEat your vegetables,\u201d Lan Wangji says, the third time Wei Wuxian drops a stray piece of cauliflower onto Lan Wangji\u2019s plate. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a face. \u201cYou know I only like certain vegetables,\u201d he whines. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji levels him with a look, but blessedly doesn\u2019t say anything more on the subject. Instead, he starts to pick out all of his carrots and snowpeas, depositing them onto Wei Wuxian\u2019s plate.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins at him. What did he say? Lan Wangji is a Big Softy, and Wei Wuxian will fight anyone who disagrees. </p>\n<p>He eats his carrots and snowpeas without much complain. Snowpeas are not exactly on his list of favourite vegetables, but they\u2019re acceptable enough that he will eat them if there are no other options. And there is no other option \u2013 he has to be on his best behaviour if he is to ask Lan Wangji for a favour.</p>\n<p>Right. Best behaviour. </p>\n<p>He can do that. He can be the epitome of good behaviour. </p>\n<p>Across them, Jiang Cheng kicks at Wei Wuxian\u2019s shin. \u201cWhy do you have a very suspicious look on your face?\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes at him. \u201cYou always think I have a suspicious look on my face.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s always true,\u201d Jiang Cheng shoots back.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan doesn\u2019t think so!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and then nudges Lan Wangji with his elbow. \u201cRight, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, without looking away from his food, or stopping in his motions of picking out acceptable vegetables for Wei Wuxian, which is over and beyond what Wei Wuxian has learnt to expect of Lan Wangji during mealtimes, considering how six months ago, he wouldn\u2019t even think to break his \u201cno speaking during meals\u201d rule to respond. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is truly the best roommate Wei Wuxian could\u2019ve wished for. Wei Wuxian really needs to be nicer to him.</p>\n<p>He picks up a piece of sweet sour fish from his own plate, and drops it onto Lan Wangji\u2019s. At Lan Wangji\u2019s questioning look, he smiles and says, \u201cIt\u2019s nice today. I was surprised you didn\u2019t order it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, apparently satisfied with the explanation, and then returns the gesture by placing a piece of his chicken neatly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s rice. \u201cThey made it saltier today. You\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang share a look. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cI can\u2019t be nice to Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang say in tandem. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian whines, tugging at Lan Wangji\u2019s sleeve. \u201cThey\u2019re bullying me! Defend my honour! Tell them I\u2019m nice to you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says dutifully, and Nie Huaisang snickers. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beams at Lan Wangji, and gives him another piece of sweet sour fish.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>That night, Wei Wuxian puts on his most pitiful expression, and shuffles close to Lan Wangji as he\u2019s getting ready to go to bed. \u201cJust one night,\u201d he pleads. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get fixed till Monday,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen...just till Monday?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks hopefully.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at him \u2013 his stare could either mean <i>do not even think about it if you don\u2019t want to get hurt</i> or <i>who am I to say no to a good friend who is in need of my help</i>. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is quite minded to stay hopeful. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhaaaaan,\u201d he whines, and throws in his best <i>I\u2019m your roommate and I might die if you don\u2019t help me out</i> smile. It\u2019s a charmer. He\u2019s practised it in front of a mirror enough times to know that. </p>\n<p>Even then, even in the face of Wei Wuxian\u2019s (self-proclaimed) stunner of a smile, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lets out a deflated sigh. \u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll go ask if I can sleep with Wen Ning tonight,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji. He really should\u2019ve started with that, but Wen Ning\u2019s roommate is, tragically, Wen Chao, and honestly, <i>ew</i>, no? </p>\n<p>He turns to leave, but Lan Wangji grasps at his wrist before he\u2019s able to go. \u201cTill Monday,\u201d Lan Wangji says, voice clipped. </p>\n<p>\u201cTill Monday,\u201d Wei Wuxian promises, and then shamelessly slides himself into Lan Wangji\u2019s covers. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re so good to me. I knew you wouldn\u2019t leave me to suffer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lam Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything, but Wei Wuxian hears the soft, resigned sigh he lets out when he heads to turn the light switch off. </p>\n<p>Well, that wouldn\u2019t do.</p>\n<p>He waits till Lan Wangji slides into bed before he grins into the dark, and snuggles up close to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wei Ying</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bed is small,\u201d Wei Wuxian says reasonably. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to fall off the bed in the middle of the night, not after you\u2019ve been so kind as to let me share your bed. I fidget when I sleep, you know that. What if I kick you off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had thought that some physical contact would lighten Lan Wangji\u2019s mood. It always seems to, at least a little. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t show it much, but Wei Wuxian can tell that he\u2019s not exactly too bothered when he drapes himself all around Lan Wangji, or touches him more than anyone else probably does. </p>\n<p>This time though, Lan Wangji is quiet, and his body remains tense against Wei Wuxian\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Still, he can\u2019t help but to shift closer and murmur, \u201cGo to sleep, Lan <i>er-gege</i>. I promise I\u2019ll be good.\u201d </p>\n<p>There is more silence from Lan Wangji\u2019s end, but his body relaxes against Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles, and drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wakes up before Lan Wangji does, which is a first. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly used to sharing a single bed with anyone else, and it\u2019s not exactly the most comfortable position to be, pressed against the wall. He like spreading his limbs out when he sleeps, but he\u2019s also mindful of disrupting Lan Wangji\u2019s rest. </p>\n<p>He chances a quick look at Lan Wangji, features still soft in his slumber. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has always known that Lan Wangji is beautiful, but this close to him, with all of Lan Wangji\u2019s features relaxed, he\u2019s stunning. Wei Wuxian would never admit it, even at gunpoint, but he thinks he feels a flutter in his chest that he\u2019s definitely not going to try to prod or analyse. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wakes up then, as though Wei Wuxian\u2019s thoughts are too loud for him. He blinks up softly at Wei Wuxian, and Wei Wuxian swallows. </p>\n<p>He swears he\u2019s never thought of Lan Wangji like this in the time they\u2019ve been friends, but in that moment, the only thing he can think of is how Lan Wangji\u2019s lips would feel against his own. </p>\n<p>Well. It\u2019s not like Wei Wuxian is particularly good at denying himself of what he wants. </p>\n<p>He shifts closer, says, \u201cLan Zhan, do you want to-?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares at him. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t voiced his entire query, but given the context and how well Lan Wangji is supposed to be able to read him, Wei Wuxian thinks he\u2019s made himself as clear as he can. </p>\n<p>A beat goes by. </p>\n<p>And then another. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is still just staring at Wei Wuxian, not saying anything, and for a moment, Wei Wuxian thinks that in an effort to save their relationship, he should really backtrack, should try to laugh the entire thing off, should even pretend that he\u2019s sleepwalking, but then.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d Lan Wangji says, voice hoarse, and then kisses him.</p>\n<p>For all his flirting and all his big talk, Wei Wuxian\u2019s never really had too many opportunities to mess around with boys. He\u2019s always thought that it wouldn\u2019t be much different from kissing a girl, but with Lan Wangji\u2019s lips hot and insistent on his, with the hard planes of Lan Wangji\u2019s body against his, and <i>oh</i>-</p>\n<p>Oh, <i>this</i> is different. </p>\n<p>He experimentally palms Lan Wangji through his pyjamas bottoms. Lan Wangji pants against his lips, eyes dark with want, and fuck, if that isn\u2019t a sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it feel good, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, eager to draw more reactions out from Lan Wangji. \u201cCan I keep going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses him again, draws Wei Wuxian close, and shifts so he\u2019s pinning Wei Wuxian to the bed by his wrists. \u201cYes,\u201d he breathes. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles at that, and wiggles his arms. \u201cYou have to let me go so I can keep touching, Lan <i>er-gege</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shudders at that, as if that of all the things that have just been happening in the past couple of minutes, this is the one that affects him the most, and okay, wow, that\u2019s a lot of information to unpack. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is never going to be able to call him Lan <i>er-gege</i> in public without popping a boner ever again.</p>\n<p><i>Worth it</i>, he thinks, when Lan Wangji lets his hands go, and lets Wei Wuxian straddle him. He snakes his hand into Lan Wangji\u2019s pyjamas, and Lan Wangji lets out a cry, tugging Wei Wuxian down so he can bury his face into Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he murmurs against Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin. \u201cWei Ying, you feel-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Wei Wuxian purrs when Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t finish his sentence. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Good</i>,\u201d Lan Wangji breathes, and then turns to capture Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips again. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s the easiest thing to lose himself to the sensations, to the weight of Lan Wangji\u2019s length in his hand, to the scrape of Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth against his jaw, to the soft noises that Lan Wangji lets out. </p>\n<p>He learns that Lan Wangji\u2019s skin is soft everywhere, that he arches into every touch Wei Wuxian lays on him, that his own name sounds positively sinful when Lan Wangji gasps it like <i>that</i>. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, he learns what Lan Wangji looks like with his head thrown back in pleasure, what Lan Wangji sounds like when he\u2019s on the cusp of release, and later, what Lan Wangji <i>tastes</i> like. </p>\n<p>\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Wangji says, but there\u2019s no heat in his voice, and the look in his eyes cannot possibly be anything other than desire, so Wei Wuxian just smirks at him, before he drops down next to Lan Wangji, spent and sated. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s still early, way before either of them have to go to class and at least a good ninety minutes away from when Lan Wangji likes to leave for breakfast, so Wei Wuxian cosies up to Lan Wangji and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>No-one ever told him that early mornings could be like this. His entire life has been a lie.</p>\n<p>He falls asleep to Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers in his hair, gentle and soft. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s already left for class by the time Wei Wuxian wakes up next, sometime around midday. </p>\n<p>There is a familiar brown paper bag on his desk, and Wei Wuxian smiles when he sees it \u2013 Lan Wangji packed breakfast for him when he went to the dining hall. </p>\n<p>He brings the packed lunch with him when he heads for class, and during a bout of boredom, texts Lan Wangji: </p>\n<p>\n<i>thank you for breakfast! should i take it that lan er gege was very pleased with my performance last night</i>\n</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not reply. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like Wei Wuxian is exactly expecting him to. Lan Wangji rarely replies to Wei Wuxian\u2019s texts unless it\u2019s important. </p>\n<p>He frowns at his phone. <i>Tsk</i>, he thinks, <i>this is rather important</i>. </p>\n<p>He redirects his attention into pestering Jiang Cheng instead. \u201cJiang Cheng, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng glares at him. \u201cYou just ate an entire breakfast.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still hungry,\u201d Wei Wuxian whines. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not like Lan Wangji. I\u2019m going to feed you,\u201d Jiang Cheng tells him, and shifts to the next seat to put some distance between himself and Wei Wuxian. \u201cNow shut up, I\u2019m trying to pay attention in class.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pouts at him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell <i>shijie</i> you tried to starve me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t reply. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slumps against the table, and sighs. If only Nie Huaisang hadn\u2019t ditched class today. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s just about ready to take a bathroom break so he can walk around outside the lecture hall for fifteen minutes when Jiang Cheng slides him an energy bar. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian perks up, and moves into the seat Jiang Cheng had earlier vacated. \u201cI knew you loved me,\u201d he tells Jiang Cheng, knocking their shoulders together, tearing the energy bar wrapper apart. \u201cYou\u2019re my favourite sibling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cSay that again in front of <i>jie</i> and maybe I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He breaks the energy bar into halves, and passes one half to Jiang Cheng. \u201cFine, you\u2019re my second favourite sibling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng gives him a look. \u201cYou <i>only</i> have <i>two</i> siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins at him. \u201cLosing to <i>shijie</i> is a very acceptable outcome, Jiang Cheng.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2013 </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is already back in their room when Wei Wuxian gets back from class. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls out cheerily. \u201cDid you get my text?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji spares him a scathing glance before he turns back to his books. \u201cShameless,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies easily, and then drapes himself over Lan Wangji\u2019s back. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t stiffen at his touch, and he doesn\u2019t immediately tell Wei Wuxian to get lost, so Wei Wuxian figures he can\u2019t be that far off by guessing that Lan Wangji enjoyed last night just as much as Wei Wuxian did. </p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>am</i> shameless,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers by Lan Wangji\u2019s ear. \u201cBut was I wrong, though, <i>er-gege</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sets his pen down, and very calmly says, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins. \u201cThen...will <i>er-gege</i> be up for a repeat performance?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>On a whim, and because it\u2019s just <i>right there</i>, Wei Wuxian kisses the tip of Lan Wangji\u2019s reddening ear. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wei Wuxian tightens his hold on Lan Wangji. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t let go,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, reaching up to cover one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands with his own, squeezing lightly, \u201cthen I can\u2019t get up.\u201d </p>\n<p><i>Oh</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what will you do once you get up?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cWill <i>er-gege</i> punish me for being shameless?\u201d </p>\n<p>He hears the sharp intake of breath that Lan Wangji draws. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, letting go of Lan Wangji, and straightening up. \u201cYou keep surprising me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands, and turns to face Wei Wuxian. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, closing the distance between them with a step forward. \u201cNot even a little,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, and then kisses him. </p>\n<p>They don\u2019t make it down to the dining hall in time for dinner.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>There is one thing that Wei Wuxian absolutely doesn\u2019t <i>get</i> about the university\u2019s swim team \u2013 of all the people in the world, why in the world would the university appoint Lan Qiren to be their co-coach? </p>\n<p>The official story is that the swim team is too unruly for Coach Jiang to handle, what with his easy-going personality and his tendency to let his students do whatever makes them happy, and that Lan Qiren was appointed to teach the swim team some discipline, but Wei Wuxian knows better.</p>\n<p>The only reason why Lan Qiren was brought into the swim team as a co-coach was to bring misery and suffering to Wei Wuxian, that\u2019s why. </p>\n<p>Case in point, Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t even really done anything out of the usual ribbing of his teammates today, and he\u2019s already been punished to run fifty laps on the track field after training.</p>\n<p>Yeah, sure, Wei Wuxian was the one who swapped out Lan Qiren\u2019s tea for soy sauce diluted with warm water, but Lan Qiren hasn\u2019t even <i>proved</i> it yet! Wei Wuxian is almost sure that this premature punishment goes against his human rights. Or something. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not one of the worst punishments Lan Qiren\u2019s dished out on him before (that would be copying the bylaws of the swim team, three hundred times, while not being allowed to even <i>speak</i>) because at least there\u2019s no-one assigned to monitor him while he completes his punishment, but Wei Wuxian still spares a moment to bemoan his bad fortune when he\u2019s only about thirty-eight laps into his punishment and it starts pouring. </p>\n<p>Lan Qiren <i>so</i> looked up the weather reports before he decided on this punishment. </p>\n<p>He keeps running, in any event, because it is a punishment, and Wei Wuxian has learnt from previous experience with Lan Qiren that the punishment for not completing his punishment is <i>way worse</i>. </p>\n<p>When he finishes his next lap, Lan Wangji is there, holding onto an umbrella, a bottle of water in hand. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian immediately perks up. \u201cLan Zhan! What are you doing out here in the rain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes his way closer to Wei Wuxian, holding the umbrella over the both of them. \u201cYou weren\u2019t at dinner,\u201d he says, holding out the bottle of water to Wei Wuxian. \u201cJiang Cheng told me you got punished again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shrugs, but takes the bottle of water from Lan Wangji with a smile. \u201cI deserve it this time,\u201d he says, instead of telling Lan Wangji about his theory that Lan Qiren is doing all he can to make Wei Wuxian suffer. Lan Qiren is, after all, Lan Wangji\u2019s uncle. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives him a look. \u201cYou deserve it every time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pouts at him. \u201cLan <i>Zhaaaan</i>, you\u2019re supposed to be sympathetic to my plight!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you water,\u201d Lan Wangji says simply. </p>\n<p>\u201cNext time bring me some food,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him conspiringly. </p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and then presses the umbrella into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands. \u201cHow many laps do you still have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEleven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d Lan Wangji looks at him. \u201cGo back first. There is food for you in the room,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cI\u2019ll do the rest for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle said your punishment was fifty laps,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cHe never said you had to be the only person to run them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>What</i>.\u201d He blinks at Lan Wangji. \u201cWhy are you saying this like it\u2019s an established loophole that Lan Qiren allows?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods. \u201cUncle loves specificity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries to pass the umbrella back to Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019ll just finish it on my own,\u201d he tells Lan Wangji. \u201cYou\u2019ll get wet if you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold if you keep staying out here in the rain,\u201d Lan Wangji says. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen warm me up, Lan <i>er-gege</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and then leans in, and kisses Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses Wei Wuxian back, draws him close, completely uncaring of Wei Wuxian\u2019s wet clothes, and slides his tongue into Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth. Somewhere in between, the umbrella falls to their feet, but Wei Wuxian has more important things to think about.</p>\n<p>Like how good Lan Wangji\u2019s body feels against his.</p>\n<p>Like how he <i>really</i> needs to finish his laps as soon as humanly possible so that they can go back to their room where Lan Wangji can really warm him up properly. </p>\n<p>He pulls away from Lan Wangji. \u201cGo back first, Lan Zhan. I\u2019ll finish up. Give me half an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at him for a moment, and then says, \u201cI\u2019ll run with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian means to say no, he really, really does, because there\u2019s no reason to make Lan Wangji go through Wei Wuxian\u2019s punishment with him, but Lan Wangji reaches up, and drags his thumb over Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips, and Wei Wuxian gives in, resolve collapsing like a house of cards.</p>\n<p>Running laps feels a lot less like punishment and more like foreplay with Lan Wangji around anyway. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll race you,\u201d he ends up saying.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji snorts. \u201cYou\u2019ve already run thirty odd laps. You\u2019re in no shape to race me,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian, not mocking, just true, and said in that nonchalant sort of way that Lan Wangji loves to sound. </p>\n<p>He runs at Wei Wuxian\u2019s pace right next to him for the rest of the laps, in silence, and it might just be Wei Wuxian\u2019s mind playing tricks on him, but he swears that running laps is a lot less exhausting when he gets to look at Lan Wangji out of the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji all but marches Wei Wuxian to the showers when they get back to the halls, instead of letting Wei Wuxian strip him down and have some fun first. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. \u201cAfter.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips quirk up. \u201cAfter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can...do what you want after we shower,\u201d Lan Wangji clarifies, and it\u2019s only because Wei Wuxian is looking for it that he notices the way the tips of Lan Wangji\u2019s ears redden. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s amusement must show on his face, because Lan Wangji grabs his towel, and heads for a shower cubicle quickly. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, before Lan Wangji is able to close the door on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles at him, and then pushes his way into Lan Wangji\u2019s cubicle. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji purses his lips. \u201c<i>Wei Ying</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quiet,\u201d Wei Wuxian says sweetly, and then kisses Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019ll put my mouth to better use,\u201d he whispers against the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips when they part for breath. \u201cWould you like that, Lan <i>er-gege</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji considers his words. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waits with bated breath. He\u2019s not going to lie \u2013 he has thought a lot about having his mouth on Lan Wangji\u2019s cock in the last couple of days. If Lan Wangji says no, Wei Wuxian might actually die from disappointment. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say no. </p>\n<p>He also doesn\u2019t immediately say yes. </p>\n<p>What he does is this: </p>\n<p>He reaches behind Wei Wuxian slowly, and locks the door to the cubicle. He tugs Wei Wuxian close with a hand to the back of his neck, kisses him, deep and measured, until Wei Wuxian is almost tempted to just keep doing this and only this, and then pulls away. \u201cYou will be quiet?\u201d he checks. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs out a soft laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll try?\u201d he tells Lan Wangji, and then drops to his knees. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is already hard, this much is easy to observe given the fact that his rain-soaked clothes are sticking against his body. Wei Wuxian rubs his cheek against Lan Wangji\u2019s cock, and smiles when he feels Lan Wangji shudder against him, both from the sensation and from the effort it is taking him not to buck into the touch. </p>\n<p>He makes quick work of peeling Lan Wangji out of his wet clothes. In another situation, he might tease, and Lan Wangji might even <i>enjoy</i> being teased, but they\u2019re not in the privacy of their own room, and Wei Wuxian is not so shameless that he wants them to get caught by any of their nosy floormates. </p>\n<p>He wraps his hand around Lan Wangji\u2019s length, strokes him firm and slow, the way Lan Wangji enjoys. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, looking up at Lan Wangji, \u201cwhat do you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks at him, almost as though he\u2019s been taken off guard by the question, and then says, uncalculated and almost sweetly, \u201cYou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn, Lan Wangji has a lot more game than Wei Wuxian gave him credit for. Wei Wuxian wonders how many people have fallen victim to Lan Wangji like this before. </p>\n<p>He rewards Lan Wangji with a firm upward stroke, follows it up with a ghost of a kiss to the tip of Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. \u201cWhat else?\u201d he murmurs, seeking clarity. \u201cHow do you like getting your cock sucked, <i>er-gege</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows \u2013 one day they\u2019re really going to need to have a conversation about Lan Wangji\u2019s kinks properly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d Lan Wangji says. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Wei Wuxian stares up at him. \u201cNo time like the present to find out, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cups Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, and gently runs his thumb over the curve of his cheekbones. \u201cMn,\u201d he tells Wei Wuxian, and surrenders himself to Wei Wuxian and lets Wei Wuxian take him apart.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>Midterms season is the worst. </p>\n<p>For all that Wei Wuxian fools around in class, and skips as many tutorials as he\u2019s able to without drastically affecting his attendance marks, he\u2019s on a scholarship, and he has grade projections to keep up with. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is the perfect roommate to have, come exam season, because of how seriously he takes them. Wei Wuxian benefits from this a lot, mainly because Lan Wangji is really hot when he\u2019s stern, and Wei Wuxian has discovered that he becomes very motivated to please Lan Wangji when Lan Wangji is stern. </p>\n<p>Case in point \u2013 Wei Wuxian has already gotten into the habit of bringing out his books and his notes whenever Lan Wangji even mildly glances at him in a sterner manner than usual. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji got Wei Wuxian to go through three sets of past year questions with the promise of a kiss! That Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t even receive eventually because he fell asleep midway through the night! </p>\n<p>Point is, Lan Wangji is very good at making Wei Wuxian study, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s grades thank him for, but exam season is still <i>the worst</i> because Lan Wangji refuses to let Wei Wuxian <i>touch him</i> because it\u2019s going to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d and Wei Wuxian is \u201cterrible at dealing with distractions\u201d. Which he is, but how dare Lan Wangji use that against him as though his entire presence isn\u2019t a distraction to Wei Wuxian already. </p>\n<p>On the last day of Wei Wuxian\u2019s exams, he comes back to their room late at night, exhausted from the end of midterms celebrations that he was dragged out to by Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang. It\u2019s already past Lan Wangji\u2019s routine bedtime, so it\u2019s not surprising that the lights are off, and Lan Wangji is already in bed. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian spares a moment to pout in the dark before he makes his way to Lan Wangji to gently nudge at him to make space for himself in Lan Wangji\u2019s bed. Lan Wangji must wake up, because he shifts to accommodate Wei Wuxian, and wraps his arms around Wei Wuxian when Wei Wuxian curls around him. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian sighs, snuggling close. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt went well?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, voice scratchy with sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care,\u201d Wei Wuxian says flippantly, and breathes Lan Wangji in. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he sighs again. </p>\n<p>\u201cSleep,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him. \u201cYou must be tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tips his head up, and kisses Lan Wangji instead. Lan Wangji kisses back, soft and slow, and pulls away when Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands start to wander. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a noise of dissent. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lan Wangji says gently. \u201cLater. After you\u2019ve had some sleep.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles, and tucks his face back into the crook of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll listen to my good Lan <i>er-gege</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji curls his arm around Wei Wuxian. \u201cGoodnight, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, after a short pause. </p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you remind me when I wake up that I really want you to finger me? I was thinking about it all through my exam.\u201d He nips at Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cI was hard through like at least half of it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wei Ying</i>,\u201d Lan Wangji scolds, but it\u2019s not a no, and they both know it. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian smiles against Lan Wangji\u2019s skin, and lets himself drift off to sleep. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Lan Wangji recently?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks, when they\u2019re all camped out in the common room, waiting for a pizza delivery.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean what\u2019s going on?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks nonchalantly. \u201cNothing\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang smirks. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more handsy with each other than you used to be,\u201d he comments. \u201cAnd it already used to be pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m not handsy with Lan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like it when people touch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cWe know he doesn\u2019t. He only lets you do it. So I\u2019ll repeat my question: what\u2019s going on with you and Lan Wangji?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Wei Wuxian insists. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither Jiang Cheng nor Nie Huaisang look convinced. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood friends,\u201d Wei Wuxian amends, and sips at his frappuccino. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw you guys kissing like last night,\u201d Nie Huaisang says. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian chokes. Lan Wangji is going to be so mad when he finds out that\u2019s how they got caught. He\u2019d told Wei Wuxian that someone was going to see them, but Wei Wuxian had had a couple of drinks and was riding off the high from winning another gold medal. He\u2019d demanded a congratulatory kiss, and Lan Wangji had eventually relented. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow? We ducked behind a tree-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>HA!</i>\u201d Jiang Cheng screeches, and flashes the other students in the common room a sheepish smile when it startles them. \u201cWe were only 60% sure, but now we know for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI genuinely thought it was a drunken hallucination,\u201d Nie Huaisang says. \u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe you are dating Hanguang-Jun. Is he a good kisser? Is he fit? He must be really fit. How is he in bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI am <i>not</i> dating Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says hotly. \u201cAnd none of that other stuff is or should be any of your business!\u201d </p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang smirks. \u201cWhy? Jealous that someone else is objectifying your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng leans forward, and stares at Wei Wuxian, \u201cThen what is he to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels like he\u2019s walked into a trap. He really should\u2019ve known. He only came out with them today because Jiang Cheng said he would pay for Wei Wuxian\u2019s drink, but when has Jiang Cheng, being Jiang Cheng, ever given Wei Wuxian anything that Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t continuously pester him for? </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not ready to have this conversation. With Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang, especially. He\u2019s not even really sure he\u2019s ready to have this conversation with himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re <i>friends</i>,\u201d he says firmly. This really isn\u2019t the time or the place to question his own feelings. \u201cJust friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd last night?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks, eyes narrowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get frisky when I\u2019ve had a couple of drinks in me, you know that,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies. </p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang don\u2019t look too convinced, so Wei Wuxian forces out a laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you think I\u2019m dating Lan Zhan. Can you imagine me? Dating someone as boring as Lan Zhan?\u201d </p>\n<p>His own stomach churns at his words. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t dare to think more of it. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>This is the thing about Lan Wangji \u2013 he really likes his routines. He wakes up at ungodly hours of the day because his body is too used to it, he can\u2019t skip breakfast because it\u2019s the most important meal of the day, and, barring any emergencies, he goes to bed every night at 9pm. </p>\n<p>So it\u2019s more than a little concerning when it\u2019s almost half past nine, and Lan Wangji still hasn\u2019t returned to their room yet. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian checks his phone for the thirteenth time in the last minute. </p>\n<p>No texts from Lan Wangji, no missed calls as well. Wei Wuxian has rung him a couple of times; Lan Wangji\u2019s phone isn\u2019t turned off, but he isn\u2019t picking up Wei Wuxian\u2019s calls as well. </p>\n<p>Somewhere in between waiting for Lan Wangji to come back, Wei Wuxian must\u2019ve fallen asleep, because he wakes up to his phone alarm going off. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows for certain that he did not set his alarm himself. Lan Wangji must\u2019ve done it for him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is already gone, but hey, at least he\u2019s been back, so he must be fine, just busy, probably. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a mental note to remind himself to make sure that Lan Wangji is taking care of himself, and not just toughing it out in the library. Maybe he should go and pester Lan Wangji there, just so that Lan Wangji will acquiesce to taking a break. </p>\n<p>He sends a quick text to Lan Wangji to thank him for setting the alarm, and asks where Lan Wangji is.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t reply, which again, isn\u2019t the most surprising occurrence. Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t all that bothered about it, even though he makes sure to send Lan Wangji sad emoji faces every couple of hours through the day just on the off chance that Lan Wangji would take pity on him, and reply. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s not really a problem, at least not until Wei Wuxian has slogged through an entire day of classes and training without hearing from Lan Wangji, only to reach dinnertime and find that Lan Wangji still hasn\u2019t been back to their room or texted him back, even though Wei Wuxian knows for sure that Lan Wangji\u2019s classes ended at 2pm today. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s fairly certain that Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t have an exam coming up, so what assignment is he working on that has him so worked up? </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries calling, but reaches Lan Wangji\u2019s voice message instead. \u201cLan Zhan, where are you? Are you not coming back for dinner? Are you <i>skipping</i> dinner? You know that\u2019s bad for you, Lan Zhan! Call me back!\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is already halfway to the dining hall to meet Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang for dinner when he changes his mind, and heads in the other direction instead. Lan Wangji is probably still at the library, and he probably has his phone on silent and buried under a pile of books. If Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t go and get him, Lan Wangji might end up forgoing dinner. He might even decide to sleep in the library again.</p>\n<p>He combs through the library in search of Lan Wangji when he gets there, but Lan Wangji isn\u2019t there. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns, and calls Jiang Cheng. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you not coming to dinner?\u201d Jiang Cheng says in lieu of a greeting, when he picks up. \u201cOr are you and Lan Wangji out eating something good? If you are and have decided to leave me and Huaisang out, we will come murder you in your sleeps tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so Lan Zhan isn\u2019t at dinner as well?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cOkay, bye, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wei Wuxian, you-</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hangs up before Jiang Cheng is able to finish his sentence, grinning, but sombres up when he remembers that he still has no idea where Lan Wangji is. </p>\n<p>He calls Lan Wangji again, but doesn\u2019t leave a message this time when the call doesn\u2019t go through. </p>\n<p>He ends up back in their room, perplexed by Lan Wangji\u2019s behaviour. Lan Wangji isn\u2019t usually like this \u2013 he\u2019s not so irresponsible that he would go off-radar when he knows that Wei Wuxian would be worried. </p>\n<p>He settles in Lan Wangji\u2019s bed, armed with his laptop and notes for class. If he has to pull an all-nighter just to wait for Lan Wangji to show up, then he\u2019s very well going to do that. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian ends up waking up to an alarm he knows he didn\u2019t set again.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is still nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p>God fucking dammit. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cXichen <i>ge</i>!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells from across the pond when he spots Lan Xichen the next day after class. He jogs his way to Lan Xichen. \u201cXichen <i>ge</i>, have you seen Lan Zhan around? He hasn\u2019t been back to the halls in a couple of days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen quirks an eyebrow. \u201cI invited him home for dinner on Sunday, and he decided to stay for a couple of days. Did he not tell you?\u201d Lan Xichen asks. \u201cI assumed he did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, relieved. He still doesn\u2019t know why Lan Wangji wouldn\u2019t just <i>tell him</i> he was going to stay with his brother for a few days, but hey, at least he knows where Lan Wangji is now, and he knows that Lan Wangji is safe. </p>\n<p>He contemplates asking Lan Xichen if he knows what Wei Wuxian did to annoy Lan Wangji into ignoring him for so many days, but in the end, his pride wins out, and he thanks Lan Xichen for his time, and heads morosely back to the halls. </p>\n<p>He ends up in Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang\u2019s room, playing video games and snacking on food from the care package that Nie Huaisang\u2019s brother sent him, because his own room feels sad and empty without Lan Wangji in it. He almost thinks about crashing in their room for the night, but when Jiang Cheng starts snoring, Wei Wuxian lets out a resigned sigh, and heads back to his own room instead. </p>\n<p>It turns out to be a fantastic idea, because when he gets back to his room, Lan Wangji is back. He\u2019s already asleep, from the looks of it, so Wei Wuxian takes care not to be loud.</p>\n<p>He makes his way quietly to Lan Wangji, and crawls into bed with him, curling his body around Lan Wangji\u2019s, and falls asleep to the soft rise and fall of Lan Wangji\u2019s chest against his palm. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sleeps better than he has in days.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>When he wakes up the next morning, Lan Wangji is gone again, even though Wei Wuxian knows for certain that he doesn\u2019t have an early class today. </p>\n<p>He has this terrible feeling in his chest that there\u2019s something really wrong. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been more than four days since the last time he even <i>saw</i> Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has never gone so long without speaking to Wei Wuxian. Even in the beginning, when they were still getting used to each other, when Wei Wuxian used to annoy him so much that even him breathing around Lan Wangji would get Lan Wangji worked up, Lan Wangji would never ignore him. </p>\n<p>Whatever that Wei Wuxian has done this time, and he still doesn\u2019t even know <i>what</i> he did, he must have reached Lan Wangji\u2019s limit.</p>\n<p>He bolts out of bed, and heads for Lan Wangji\u2019s desk. He really needs to figure out where Lan Wangji is. If Wei Wuxian done something wrong, he is more than happy to apologise to Lan Wangji, but he needs to find Lan Wangji before he\u2019s able to do that. </p>\n<p>There must be some clues as to where Lan Wangji is hiding himself. He slept in the halls last night and he\u2019s got class in the afternoon, so he can\u2019t have gone back to Lan Xichen\u2019s apartment across town. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s only logical to assume that Lan Wangji is still on campus. He would guess the library, but if Lan Wangji is avoiding him on purpose, then Lan Wangji will steer clear of the library, knowing that Wei Wuxian would try to seek him out there. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's guqin is still placed neatly by his desk, so he probably hasn\u2019t gone to practise in one of the music rooms. Besides, Wei Wuxian\u2019s also got minions keeping tabs on the music rooms to alert him when Lan Wangji makes a booking on any of the rooms, so he knows Lan Wangji isn\u2019t there. </p>\n<p>He scans through Lan Wangji\u2019s desk, looking for clues as to where Lan Wangji might be, and a familiar green piece of paper catches his eye. He tugs it out from where it\u2019s placed with Lan Wangji\u2019s other music sheets, and feels his chest tighten painfully when he reads the words on the form \u2013 <b>ROOM TRANSFER FORM</b>.</p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p><b>nhs:</b> <i>you know i can\u2019t sign for you for this class right</i> </p>\n<p><b>nhs:</b> <i>SHE WILL KNOW IMMEDIATELY IF YOU\u2019RE NOT IN CLASS</i></p>\n<p><b>nhs:</b> <i>YOU\u2019RE COMING TO CLASS RIGHT</i></p>\n<p><b>nhs:</b> <i>MADAM YU IS PHYSICALLY GOING TO WHIP YOUR SKIN OFF YOU IF YOU DITCH</i> </p>\n<p><b>jc:</b> <i>mother realised the moment she stepped into the room that you ditched. rip you.</i></p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>Whatever painful death Madam Yu has prepared for Wei Wuxian is honestly going to have to wait until Wei Wuxian sorts out this whole mess with Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian realised when he was going through Lan Wangji\u2019s desk that most of his study materials are still in the room. This means that Lan Wangji must be coming back regularly enough that he doesn\u2019t have to pack them to take to Lan Xichen\u2019s apartment. The only way that Lan Wangji must\u2019ve been able to do this without bumping into Wei Wuxian is to do it during Madam Yu\u2019s classes, because that\u2019s the only one class that Lan Wangji knows for certain that Wei Wuxian would not \u2013<i>cannot</i>\u2013 miss. </p>\n<p>Well.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji better appreciate that Wei Wuxian is risking <i>death</i> by the hands of Madam Yu just to be able to see him. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s theory turns out to be correct. It\u2019s ten minutes past three, ten minutes into when Madam Yu\u2019s lecture starts, when Wei Wuxian hears the click of the door unlocking.</p>\n<p>He steels himself. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s look of surprise is beautiful, and Wei Wuxian would normally pat himself on the back for managing to draw such an expression out of Lan Wangji, and maybe tease Lan Wangji about it a little, but this is neither the time nor place for it. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji visibly collects himself before he says, \u201cDon\u2019t you have class with Madam Yu now? You shouldn\u2019t give her more reasons to dislike you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not important right now,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and then burrows into Lan Wangji, circles Lan Wangji\u2019s waist with his arms, and holds on tight so he can\u2019t escape again. \u201cWhy are you mad at me?\u201d he asks into Lan Wangji\u2019s sweater. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Lan Wangji says- Nay, <i>lies</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you are!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me and ignoring my messages, and now you even want to move out!\u201d He pulls away slightly so he can look at Lan Wangji. \u201cWhy are you mad at me, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Lan Wangji says again. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it when you ignore me,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him softly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to move out.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is quiet for a beat. Then, he asks, \u201cWei Ying, what are we doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I to you?\u201d Lan Wangji asks. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks again, because the question feels familiar. He\u2019s recently been asked this question before, he thinks. And, <i>oh</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou overheard my conversation,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not-\u201d Lan Wangji cuts himself off when Wei Wuxian\u2019s grip on him tightens. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries his best to remember the contents of the conversation he had the other day. What did he tell Jiang Cheng? He told Jiang Cheng that of course he wasn\u2019t in a relationship with Lan Wangji. Because that\u2019s true! Isn\u2019t it? </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian would know if he was in a relationship with Lan Wangji. Certainly Lan Wangji would\u2019ve said something if that\u2019s what they were doing. </p>\n<p>Whatever he\u2019s thinking must show on his face, because Lan Wangji looks away from him. Wei Wuxian manages to catch the flash of disappointment in Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes, and he can feel Lan Wangji stiffening against him, and it\u2019s suddenly quite apparent that Lan Wangji means to stop having this conversation, to try to <i>leave</i> again, and it startles the words out of Wei Wuxian. </p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept well these last couple of days,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re not around, when I can\u2019t see you. If I had my way, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend a day- No, <i>an hour</i> without you by my side. I feel better when you\u2019re around. And when you\u2019re not, I always have you on my mind.\u201d He takes a deep breath, and then continues softly, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019re boring at all? I find you fascinating? You know so much! And you do so much! And I think\u2026 I think you\u2019re the only person in this world who truly understands me. I don\u2019t know what any of that is supposed to mean, but it\u2019s all true? I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian must\u2019ve said <i>something</i> right, because Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze goes infinitely soft. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels a flutter in his chest that he doesn\u2019t think he dares to analyse. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Lan Wangji says gently, and Wei Wuxian hugs him again, burrowing his face into Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ignore me anymore?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s thumb rubs soothing circles against the nape of Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to move to another room?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, voice small. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. \u201cThe form isn\u2019t for me. The residential manager wanted me to give it to Wen Ning. A vacancy opened up on our floor, and she wanted to know if Wen Ning wanted to move up here instead of staying with Wen Chao still.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, stupidly relieved. \u201cOkay. Good. I thought\u2026\u201d He lets out a sigh of relief. \u201cIs everything okay now? Are we okay now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks up at Lan Wangji. \u201c<i>Er-gege</i>, I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he sighs. \u201cWill you take me to bed now?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does. </p>\n<p>\u2013</p>\n<p>\n<b>EPILOGUE:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite Second Master Lan back to Yunmeng with us for the break?\u201d Jiang Yanli asks, when Wei Wuxian vaguely expresses that he might not go back with them for the mid-semester break. </p>\n<p>This whole...thing with Lan Wangji is still new, and Wei Wuxian is enjoying Lan Wangji\u2019s attention on him. It\u2019s not that he really thinks that two weeks away from Lan Wangji would change anything, but it\u2019s <i>two weeks</i>, and even just thinking about not seeing Lan Wangji for two weeks is already making his skin crawl. </p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli\u2019s idea presents new options for Wei Wuxian. He\u2019s not going to deny that the idea of having Lan Wangji in his childhood home, of <i>having</i> Lan Wangji in his bed, is a thrilling one. </p>\n<p>\u201cMadam Yu might not\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian trails off.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng snorts. \u201cMight not what? Like your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian throws a stray napkin at him. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d he mumbles, pointedly not looking at either of his siblings. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not exactly like he\u2019s lying; they haven\u2019t really put a label on that thing that they\u2019re doing yet, so it would be a little presumptuous to say that Lan Wangji is his boyfriend. </p>\n<p>God, does Lan Wangji even want to be his boyfriend?</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian himself is still not exactly sure about the depth of his own feelings for Lan Wangji, and he\u2019s not exactly sure that he wants to try to find out, mostly because he thinks the answer will scare even himself. </p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes. \u201cI caught you with your tongue in his mouth last weekend. <i>Again</i>,\u201d he reminds Wei Wuxian. \u201cJust friends my foot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng,\u201d Jiang Yanli admonishes gently. Wei Wuxian only has half a second to be smug that Jiang Yanli is defending him from Jiang Cheng\u2019s unnecessary and inappropriate bullying when she turns to him, and says, \u201cWould you be okay if Second Master Lan did all the things he does with you with another friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng smirks. \u201cOh, yeah, imagine Lan Wangji being <i>friends</i> with Jin Guangyao.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks about the possibility, despite knowing that the reason that Lan Wangji and Jin Guangyao are on good terms with each other is because they share a class, and that Jin Guangyao is a...close friend of Lan Xichen. </p>\n<p>He thinks about the possibility of Lan Wangji smiling at Jin Guangyao in private, of Lan Wangji allowing Jin Guangyao to touch him, of Lan Wangji saying \u201c<i>Meng Yao</i>\u201d in that soft and almost-fond way that he says \u201c<i>Wei Ying</i>\u201d. </p>\n<p>He thinks about Lan Wangji allowing <i>anyone else</i> the liberties that he allows Wei Wuxian, and his chest feels uncomfortably tight. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian says firmly to Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli\u2019s smile is very gentle and very kind. \u201cOf course he wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she tells Wei Wuxian. \u201cHe\u2019ll only do those things with you because he likes you, A-Xian. And you wouldn\u2019t do the same things with anyone else too. Because you like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot,\u201d Jiang Cheng chimes in. </p>\n<p>And just like that, everything slots into place for Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>He stands abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks he hears Jiang Cheng laughing at him, but he\u2019s already too busy trying to remember Lan Wangji\u2019s class schedule to do anything more than just to blindly throw a loquat in Jiang Cheng\u2019s direction, and hope that it hits him. </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes his way to the lecture hall that he knows Lan Wangji is in, throwing the door open. He almost winces when he realises that it\u2019s Lan Qiren\u2019s lecture that he\u2019s intruding on, but Wei Wuxian is not a quitter, and he did not cross the campus in half the time that it would\u2019ve taken anyone else just to chicken out right now. </p>\n<p>He finds Lan Wangji. It\u2019s not hard \u2013 Wei Wuxian swears he could pick Lan Wangji out of a crowd of thousands in a heartbeat. </p>\n<p>The twitch of Lan Wangji\u2019s eyebrows means that he\u2019s mildly surprised to see Wei Wuxian there. </p>\n<p>Well, Wei Wuxian hopes Lan Wangji is all buckled up, because he is about to surprise him a hell lot more. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he says loudly. \u201cLan Zhan, I like you!\u201d </p>\n<p>The class bursts into excited hushed murmurs. </p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes widen minutely, and his lips part. </p>\n<p>There. Proper surprise. </p>\n<p>\u201cI really like you! I like you so much!\u201d Wei Wuxian continues. \u201cI want to be with you every day! I want to hold your hand, and kiss your lips, and whisper sweet nothings to you! In public!\u201d He hears a giggle from his left, and it messes with his brain-to-mouth filter. \u201cI want to sleep with you every night!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Lan Qiren roars. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that!\u201d Wei Wuxian says quickly. \u201cI mean, yes, like that, but also not like that! That\u2019s not the point! The point is, Lan Zhan, I never want to be apart from you. I can\u2019t live if you\u2019re not by my side. I want to be with you forever. Only you, it has to be you. My heart beats only for you! I like you so much my heart is bursting with it!\u201d He pauses for breath. \u201cLan Zhan. My darling, darling Lan Zhan, will you please be my boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Wei Wuxian!</i>\u201d Lan Qiren says again.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian winces, because it really does sound like Lan Qiren is three seconds away from 1) having an aneurysm, or 2) murdering Wei Wuxian slowly and painfully with whatever tool he can get his hands on the fastest. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Professor Lan, sorry,\u201d he tells Lan Qiren before he turns back to face Lan Wangji. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside for you to finish your class, Lan Zhan! I won\u2019t leave before you come out, I promise!\u201d He grins at Lan Wangji, because it\u2019s impossible not to grin at the look on his face. \u201cBecause I like you! So much!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren bellows, \u201cGet out!\u201d </p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sags against the wall when he comes out to a blessedly empty hallway. That had been more exciting than he thought it would be. He hadn\u2019t realised that vocalising his feelings to Lan Wangji would be so exhilarating, so freeing. </p>\n<p>He grins, and wonders how Lan Wangji is faring. </p>\n<p>He expects to have to wait for another 25 minutes until class is over for Lan Wangji, but he\u2019s barely been out there for two minutes when the door to the lecture hall opens, and Lan Wangji comes staggering out. </p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, making his way over to Lan Wangji. </p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, when Wei Wuxian is close enough. His voice shakes. \u201cYou said-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes Lan Wangji\u2019s hands in his. \u201cI know what I said,\u201d he says, and smiles at Lan Wangji. \u201cI meant it all. I <i>like</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji breaks ahold of Wei Wuxian\u2019s grasp, reaches out with hands that are trembling slightly, and cups Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, softly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leans into the touch. \u201cLan Zhan, will you be my boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses him in answer. </p>\n<p>When they part, Wei Wuxian is grinning. He doesn\u2019t think he can physically stop himself. His heart feels so full he thinks it\u2019s about to burst, and he\u2019s happy, <i>so happy</i>. </p>\n<p>He thumbs at the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips. \u201cLan <i>er-gege</i>, give us a smile, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does as he says, lets the corner of his lips curve up, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath hitches. He immediately covers Lan Wangji\u2019s lips with his own, kisses the smile off Lan Wangji\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo more smiling in public,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells Lan Wangji when they part. \u201cOther people might get ideas and try to steal you away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji smiles again, slight but infinitely soft. Wei Wuxian thinks it\u2019s about time he invests in some medication for heart palpitations. \u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy heart also beats only for you,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, honest, and then kisses Wei Wuxian again.</p>"
