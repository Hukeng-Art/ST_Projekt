  "text": "<p>\u201cAlright, heads you get the one on the right, tails you get the one on the right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do I have to get the girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause girls give me cooties,\u201d Stiles pouts.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cRock, paper, scissors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you two are pathetic,\u201d Allison scoffs from behind them.</p>\n<p>They both swivel on their chairs and she slams two large files down in Stiles\u2019 lap. Stiles jerks upwards with a pained expression and then curls in on himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, Allison, why? Don\u2019t you want me to have babies one day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison pats the top of his head unsympathetically, and then points at Derek. Derek does <em>not</em> back away minimally.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake the one on the right, she\u2019s not methodical enough for Stiles and the one on the left needs work on his bedside manner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely don\u2019t send the one on the left to Derek, then,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>Derek scowls down at him and Stiles rolls his head upwards from where it\u2019s resting on his knees to grin at him. \u201cI\u2019m kidding; you\u2019re a delight with all your patients.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just interns,\u201d Allison says with an exasperated sigh. \u201cThey won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Stiles mutters darkly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoooh, the one on the left is pretty,\u201d Lydia remarks, suddenly appearing at the nurse\u2019s station.</p>\n<p>Stiles starts when she flicks at his ear and growls up at her. \u201cWhat do you want, oh Dark Queen of Hearts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust came to wish you boys luck, I hear Reyes has been making Deaton\u2019s life <em>hell</em> up in neuro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely yours then,\u201d Stiles beams at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs inwardly and wishes, just once, he could say no to Stiles.</p>\n<p>He holds his hands up and then stands from where he\u2019s been slouching against the desk. \u201cFine.\u201d He strides over to where the two interns are perched on the plastic chairs of the waiting area. \u201cYou,\u201d he points at the blonde girl. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tall, hulking guy next to her lets out a visible sigh of relief and the girl pouts.</p>\n<p>Derek chooses to ignore it and glances at the file in front of him. \u201cReyes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErica.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cDo you have appropriate clothing with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica looks down at her silver blouse and grey wool skirt. If Derek were the kind of person that put \u2018fashionista\u2019 terms to things he would say she looked <em>fabulous</em>. She seems to agree because she looks back up at him unimpressed. \u201cThese won\u2019t do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re working with children,\u201d he says, slipping on his glasses and glowering at her. \u201cYou won\u2019t last two minutes in those.\u201d He nods down the hall to the locker room. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes, go.\u201d Erica stares at him for a second, but when it becomes clear he\u2019s not joking she sashays off in a huff.</p>\n<p>When Derek glances back at the station, Stiles is laughing and Lydia claps her hands slowly. He flips them both off and stalks off after Erica, batting away a curling banner wishing their patients a Happy Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>He fucking <em>hates</em> dealing with interns.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It turns out he was right to dread working with Erica. Not because she\u2019s difficult, or because she questions everything he does\u2014that he can handle. But, because she and Derek have a <em>shared</em> interest, and he utterly refuses to admit it, or discuss it with her.</p>\n<p>Erica is just as bad at taking no for an answer as Stiles is.</p>\n<p>Which is even more unfortunate because <em>Stiles</em> is the subject in question.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s single?\u201d Erica finishes stitching and looks up at him, surgical thread between her teeth.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs and yanks it out. \u201cUnhygienic,\u201d he says crossly, waving it at her. \u201cCut here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Dr Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer any medical questions you have, <em>Dr Reyes</em>, nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he straight? Because he\u2019s hot stuff and I\u2019d really like to know if he\u2019s available.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek threads his own needle, stitches up the practise mould of a hand in thirty seconds and then glowers at Erica. \u201cUntil you can do that, don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt all?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs and resists the urge to bash his head against the table. The door to the lab opens and Stiles leans into the room. Derek quietly, <em>secretly</em> enjoys seeing Stiles\u2019 face at the best of times, but he feels like he\u2019s being <em>rescued</em> as Stiles crooks a grin at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 smile widens, and he taps a hand on the door before disappearing into the corridor.</p>\n<p>Derek leaps from his chair, barely catching the smirk Erica gives him, \u201cOh, I see how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses from throwing on his coat and raises an eyebrow, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d heard about you guys up in neuro, I just didn\u2019t realise how <em>blatantly</em> unaware of it you\u2019d be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnaware of what, Dr Reyes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she finishes the second stitch with a flourish and drops the hand on the table. \u201cAm I allowed to eat lunch with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo chance,\u201d he snaps. \u201cYou have charts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen do I eat?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles nastily at her, \u201cWhen you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica huffs and storms from the room, muttering about loser attendings.</p>\n<p>Derek follows her out, grinning to himself and Stiles quirks an eyebrow at him from where he\u2019s leaning against the wall. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>He schools his features back into a scowl. \u201cNo, she asks a lot of questions. What\u2019s the other one like, Boyd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not nearly as scary as yours, he\u2019s like a baby giant. The kids <em>loved</em> him on rounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>They head for the cafeteria and Scott waves at them from their usual table. Derek presumes it\u2019s because Scott hasn\u2019t realised they\u2019ve sat at the same table for <em>five</em> years and is worried they might forget and head elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Stiles bounds over, high fiving his best friend and ruffling Isaac\u2019s hair, \u201cHow was the run last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac twists his face from where it\u2019s buried in his hands and scrunches up his nose. \u201cLong; two DOAs, an overdose and a rave down in Barage Park that went wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to splint a girl\u2019s leg in a ditch,\u201d Scott says excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBro, you sound way too happy about that,\u201d Stiles complains, opening up his bag and pulling out a Twinkie.</p>\n<p>Derek removes it from his hand silently and replaces it with an apple. Stiles scowls at him for a second then bites into it, regardless. Derek sits back and lets the group discuss the merits of dramatic lifesaving feats for winning over the ladies. Scott is convinced it\u2019ll help impress Allison; Isaac thinks Scott\u2019s a loser. Stiles\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles is falling asleep on Derek\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even realised they were sitting that close. He shifts and Stiles hums, sits back up to continue eating his apple like he didn\u2019t just fall asleep at lunch time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should switch shifts with Danny,\u201d Derek says softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNa uh, I need to keep an eye on Julianna.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him and Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cFine, maybe I\u2019ll see if he\u2019ll cover for me tomorrow. I may have slightly overestimated my ability to stay awake for three days solid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlightly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia drops her tray down beside them looking furious. Isaac shoots up in his seat bleary eyed, and Stiles almost loses his apple.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, what\u2019s got your scrubs in a twist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinstock\u2019s having an M &amp; M panel on Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Stiles groans, lolls his head back onto Derek\u2019s shoulder again, and Derek tries to look affronted, but seemingly ends up failing by the slight smirk Lydia gives him. Her own irritated expression returns as she begins snapping open her salad carton.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t encourage an opportunity to improve on our abilities or our procedural routines. But, he\u2019s using one of my patients from last month and I don\u2019t like the way members of the board have been eyeing me recently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns, \u201cYou think they\u2019re gonna get a suit from it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia sighs, jabbing her fork into her salad viscously, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac\u2019s pager goes off, and he jerks to attention, downing a suspicious looking can of soda Derek doesn\u2019t even want to <em>look</em> at the ingredients of.</p>\n<p>\u201cGSW, Scotty, get up.\u201d He yanks at Scott\u2019s shoulder and drowsily Scott stumbles after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Allison I said hi when you see her!\u201d He yells over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cPriorities,\u201d Stiles says, grinning after his best friend. \u201cThat boy has them.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cRead it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs, flips the book shut and climbs off the bed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hazel, in recovery mode after her appendectomy looks up at him with big, wide eyes. \u201cPlease, Dr Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh go on, Derek,\u201d Stiles smirks over at him from where he\u2019s changing William\u2019s bandages. \u201cShe did ask nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t Derek,\u201d Hazel says incredulously. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>doctor</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Stiles says solemnly, winking at Will who grins like he\u2019s in on the joke. \u201c<em>Doctor</em> Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek reminds himself that dozens of people call him that every day, it really shouldn\u2019t sound dirty coming from Stiles.</p>\n<p>Especially in a room full of children.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly eight o\u2019clock and <em>you</em> need to get your beauty sleep, Hazel,\u201d he says firmly. He shoots Stiles an <em>I\u2019ll kill you later</em> look and Stiles sticks his tongue out in retaliation.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Hazel huffs, before trying to roll onto her side and screeching in pain.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s quick to manoeuvre her back into a comfortable position and fluffs her pillows. He can see Stiles grinning in his periphery as the other doctor moves round Jesse\u2019s bed, but chooses not to rise to the bait.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he warns. \u201cIf you\u2019re good, tomorrow you can have ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>He heads out of the ward and hears Stiles skitter to catch up with him, throwing an arm around his shoulders. \u201cIf I\u2019m good can I have ice cream too, Doctor Hale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he huffs, shrugging Stiles\u2019 arm off and pushing him gently.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs. \u201cAw come on, don\u2019t be like that <em>Doctor</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I swear to god\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski! Hale!\u201d Dr Finstock appears out of nowhere and tosses an arm over each of their shoulders. Derek wonders if he\u2019s wearing a sign on his back that says <em>touch me</em> and inwardly grinds his teeth. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t <em>like</em> his boss, they\u2019re actually insanely lucky with how dedicated their Chief of Staff is, but, he\u2019s a <em>special snowflake</em> as Stiles says fondly when not in Finstock\u2019s hearing range.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou boys ready to present for the board next week?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d Stiles says with a beam. \u201cI\u2019ll be there to provide the pretty, obviously, but I know Derek will have a lot to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek elbows him in the ribs and Stiles squirms away, still grinning.</p>\n<p>Finstock rolls his eyes at both of them and then claps a heavy hand on one of their shoulders. \u201cJust make sure you blow them away, alright? We need the funds, so absolutely no bullshit, Stilinski. And you,\u201d he points a finger at Derek. \u201cThis time try not to pick on everything Stiles says, you\u2019re on the same damn team and there is no <em>Derek Hale works alone</em> in team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet there\u2019s some way you could work it into an anagram,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>Finstock makes a pained noise, cuffs him over the head and stalks away, white coat flapping around him dramatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know his hair gets higher every time I see him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts as he follows Stiles into the on-call room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em>does</em> have a point though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Derek turns to raise a quizzical eyebrow in Stiles\u2019 direction and then looks away again quickly as Stiles tugs his shirt over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you spent half of last year\u2019s budget meeting picking on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did no such thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you did! I was trying to get us permission to have the parent\u2019s room redecorated so it looks less like something from a seventies horror movie, and more like somewhere people might <em>actually</em> find comfortable, and you kept cutting me off!\u201d Stiles kicks one of his shoes at Derek\u2019s head and he catches it, casting a scowl over his shoulder as he strips off his own shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t remember it like that at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cYou were in a foul mood all week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister was in town.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em>,\u201d Stiles visibly rolls his eyes as he clambers up onto the bed above Derek\u2019s. \u201cWe had dinner with her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chiding him so easily, even fondly makes Derek\u2019s stomach tie itself in knots. He really tries to clamp down on the feeling of domesticity he gets whenever he and Stiles end up on the night shift together, but it\u2019s getting almost impossible.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t even happen very often these days, because they\u2019re an attending down, and one of them has to be available at any time. But, Derek\u2019s staying just in case Hazel somehow takes a turn for the worse. He drops back onto his own bed and presses the heels of his hands against his eyes. He hadn\u2019t meant to be a dick to Stiles last year, but Laura had spent the entire week talking about how perfect they were for each other and he\u2019d sort of, <em>maybe</em>, taken it out on Stiles reflexively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says finally. \u201cYou should have said something earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles huffs a laugh. \u201cI knew it was because Laura was getting to you, I knew it\u2019d pass.\u201d His face appears over the side of the bed suddenly, and he grins down at Derek. \u201cI had total faith you\u2019d turn into your usual, sunshine like self the second she was gone. And low, you did!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tosses a pillow at him and Stiles vanishes from view again, cursing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Stiles says sleepily. \u201cYou love me really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s almost glad his pager goes off two seconds later and he has to flee the room because yes, he really does. He\u2019s fucking screwed because of it, too.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes light up as Derek half falls into the break room, slapping snow off his coat. \u201cYou brought food! You are such a good provider,\u201d he hums happily, leaping up and swatting at stray dust around Derek\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, bats Stiles\u2019 hands from where they\u2019re tweaking his hair. \u201cShut up, hey\u2014\u201d he prevents Stiles from <em>raking his fingers</em> through Derek\u2019s hair, just, and waves the food at him. \u201cYou wanna eat, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe truest way to my heart,\u201d Stiles declares loftily, \u201cThere enough for Scott and Isaac?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Derek scoffs, ducking to put their food in the fridge for when they get time for dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles kicks the door open suddenly, \u201cWanna hit the scenic venue for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glances at the clock, they\u2019ve got maybe fifteen minutes before the night shift starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Stiles wheedles, \u201cI\u2019ve barely had any fresh air all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tries to point out to himself that he, too, needs the fresh air, and it\u2019s not a knee jerk reaction to make Stiles happy that has him rolling his eyes and following Stiles out into the corridor.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019M\u2019tellin\u2019 you, this is the only way to eat Thai food,\u201d Stiles mumbles with a full mouth five minutes later.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith icy cold hands and the sounds of Finstock trying to get his car to start floating around us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins at him, eyes sparkling, \u201cYep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, trying not to begrudgingly smile back. \u201cEat your food,\u201d he says after a moment, nudging Stiles gently in the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, boss, bossy,\u201d Stiles grumbles, but twists from sitting with his legs next to Derek to dangle them over the ledge, and digs in. \u201cCheck it out,\u201d he nudges Derek, \u201cYou can see my apartment block.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA true testament to the wonders of architecture,\u201d Derek says drily, not even thinking of bringing up the fact he knows he can see Stiles\u2019 apartment block from here. He even knows how long it takes to run from here to the apartment, and drive, and walk, exhausted at three am on a Friday morning when he needs a place to crash with friendly voices and the television on the background. Or, that sometimes when he\u2019s totally zoned out, bone tired and desperate, seeing the lights on, no matter whether Stiles and Scott\u2019s, or anyone in the blocks, it makes him feel just a little bit better, knowing it\u2019s there. Knowing Stiles is here, next to him, with him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s stupidly, <em>foolishly</em> in love, and he can\u2019t bring himself to take the leap, to say anything. So, instead he takes his glasses off, cleans them, and focuses on his noodles.</p>\n<p>The companiable silence lasts a moment before Stiles crows with glee, \u201cHey, look!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek turns his head, and sees snow starting to drift slowly down around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, just what we need, pile ups and frostbite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts, \u201cDon\u2019t be a sour power puff, it\u2019s pretty.\u201d He digs his fingers into Derek\u2019s side and slips a little as he does so, Derek shoots out his arm to steady him, holds him fast.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stiles</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to fall,\u201d Stiles protests, \u201cI knew you\u2019d catch me,\u201d he adds in an exaggerated breathy tone.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes again, scrunches his fingers tightly in Stiles\u2019 sweater. \u201cJust because you knew I\u2019d catch you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYadiyadiyada,\u201d Stiles teases, and when he blinks Derek can see snowflakes caught on his eyelashes. It\u2019s really <em>unfairly</em> ridiculous how pretty Stiles is. Sometimes, he thinks he\u2019s used to the way Stiles looks, then he goes and steals Derek\u2019s breath from his lungs with just the quirk of a smile, and it\u2019s like looking at him anew.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour hand\u2019s like ice,\u201d Stiles chides, dropping his plastic fork to wind his fingers around Derek\u2019s. Derek shivers a little, hopes Stiles puts it down to the weather.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause some idiot thought it\u2019d be a good idea to eat dinner on the roof in November,\u201d he says when he finds his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome idiot agreed to it,\u201d Stiles retorts, unfazed and beaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Derek huffs, \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>do</em> enjoy it when I win,\u201d Stiles says easily, returning his gaze to the snow falling, but keeping Derek\u2019s hand wrapped tight in his own warm palm.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek flips his last chart shut and pinches the bridge of his nose. The lounge is quiet; Lydia\u2019s asleep on the sofa, her hair a soft mess over her face; Isaac\u2019s got his headphone\u2019s in, hunched over his own paperwork with nothing but the sounds of his pen, scratching over forms, filling the silence.</p>\n<p>He glances at the clock and sees it\u2019s nearly two, counts under his breath for a moment and then the door swings open.</p>\n<p>\u201cRadiology can eat my motherfucking shorts,\u201d Stiles announces as he bounds into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure they\u2019d be up for that,\u201d Derek says smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>eat</em> <em>me</em>, Hale.\u201d Stiles collapses on the chair beside him, eyes scanning over him the way they always do\u2014it makes Derek\u2019s skin heat up every time, too\u2014 before he punches out a laugh. \u201cOh my god, Derek, what are you wearing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down at his scrubs and then back up at him. \u201cWell, Stiles, there\u2019s this thing you wear when you work in a hospital; they\u2019re called scrubs? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of them, but a very popular television show was named after them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>ha</em>,\u201d Stiles jabs a finger into Derek\u2019s leg and it makes him squirm. \u201cDerek, this is a whale. And over here,\u201d he jabs his finger again. \u201cThat\u2019s a polar bear. How did you put on the world\u2019s most adorable pair of scrubs and not burst into flames?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glowers at him and pushes his damn prying fingers away, he\u2019s ticklish and he\u2019s not good when people touch him.</p>\n<p>On his thigh.</p>\n<p>Particularly when he wants said people to use their tongue, instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it. I got my normal ones covered in paint this morning because <em>someone</em> moved the sign\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you leaning against a wall in another attempt to be Danny Zukko?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaw, Derek, come on, I was just kidding.\u201d Stiles pouts at him and squeezes his hands together. \u201cPlease? I promise not to say another word,\u201d he mimes zipping his mouth shut.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at his mouth for a beat too long and then clears his throat, spinning away on his chair. \u201cThat\u2019d be the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins and knocks their knees together, careless of personal space, like he always is. Derek\u2019s gotten used to it but there were times, years ago, when he would have to physically stop himself from shoving Stiles away. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> Stiles to be close; it\u2019s more that he hates it when Stiles <em>leaves</em> Derek\u2019s space. He doesn\u2019t like knowing he can\u2019t close the distance completely, stop Stiles from flying away and leaving him bereft.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese were the only spares Allison could find,\u201d he says finally.</p>\n<p>Stiles hums, chewing on a pen and looking at Derek with amused eyes. \u201cWell, you certainly made my day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy to oblige.\u201d Derek stamps down on the pleased feeling in his gut. On the fact that even when they\u2019re having a shitty time with patients or parents or, rarely, their personal lives, Stiles makes his day <em>every fucking</em> day.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the obliging sort,\u201d Stiles says loftily, eyes glinting wickedly as he continues to bump his knees against Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes flick over his face, and Derek clears his throat, fiddles wordlessly with the files next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are <em>awful</em> human beings,\u201d Lydia suddenly huffs, tossing a cushion at Stiles\u2019 head as she stands and flounces from the room.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Heyyy</em>, Lydia, didn\u2019t know you were there! Sorry?\u201d Stiles calls after her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, by all means,\u201d she yells back. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you could use a damn on call room to have your daily Stiles and Derek flirtathon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, hey, what?!\u201d Stiles turns to shoot Derek a puzzled look, and Derek tries to look confused before glaring down at his charts.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do Hanna\u2019s pre-op yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and when he glances up, Stiles is looking at him, his gaze sharp.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says finally, his long fingers running down the spines of charts until he stops at Hanna\u2019s, \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Stiles says quietly, shooting him the quirk of a smile. It\u2019s barely there, and when it vanishes Derek is left looking at Stiles\u2019 softly disappointed face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just need to get this done, and we can go get coffee\u2014\u201d he tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, no, I got charts of my own,\u201d Stiles grins weakly, spins his chair until it\u2019s round the table from Derek, bumping Isaac\u2019s gently. \u201cRain check?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek swallows, feeling like he\u2019s missed something. From across the table Isaac rolls his eyes at him, and Derek scrunches his nose back at him in return. Stiles\u2019 shoulders are stiff with tension until he falls asleep on his charts an hour later.</p>\n<p>Derek wants to drag him across to the on call room, and make him sleep in a proper bed. He wants to take care of him. He wants to curl around him and ignore the rest of the hospital for a whole day.</p>\n<p>He has new charts to finish, instead.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d Derek murmurs, and beside him Stiles breaks into a hysterical giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slow day, he won\u2019t even notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up regretting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, embrace the tomfoolery!\u201d Stiles elbows him in the dark, holds out his hand, \u201cTowel clip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hands him said implement, watches as Stiles adjusts the light on his head and uses the clip to roll Scott\u2019s sleeve up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, feels nice,\u201d Scott mumbles in his sleep.</p>\n<p>Stiles starts sniggering, buries his face in Derek\u2019s shoulder for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison,\u201d Scott sighs dreamily.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re such a clich\u00e9,\u201d Stiles tells his sleeping face, Scott\u2019s lips twitch in a small smile, and then he rolls onto his side, giving Stiles much better access to his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he wakes up, we\u2019ll tell him we thought he was a patient.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna beat you for a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m telling him this was your idea.\u201d Stiles dips more plaster in the warm water, as Derek winds stockinette round Scott\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m gonna draw your face on the cast,\u201d he continues, \u201cWith a big heart around it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d be lucky to wear my face on his sleeve,\u201d Derek sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Stiles mumbles, dusting his hands together and spinning back to Scott, \u201cGot scissors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, holding up the stockinette for Stiles to cut, \u201cWe\u2019re just doing one layer, right? He\u2019s not going to be stuck with this for six weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 grin is visible in the dark, but he pats Derek\u2019s arm, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be able to take it off later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re wasting a lot of valuable time on this,\u201d Derek muses.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but this is still <em>science</em> and\u2014\u201d Stiles wrings out the plaster, begins to wrap it round Scott\u2019s arm, \u201cHe was the one that decorated your car with flowers last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake the cast pink,\u201d Derek says after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtta boy,\u201d Stiles sticks his tongue between his teeth in concentration, \u201cCan you\u2014get the end?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek rolls his chair closer, helps Stiles trim the end of the plaster, and Stiles turns to beam at him. Derek crooks a grin back at him, feeling stupidly mischievous. Stiles swallows as he looks at Derek in the glare of the torch lights. He moves to puts Scott\u2019s arm back on the bed, twists to face Derek, and their headsets bump together.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch, sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019okay\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d Scott sits up, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles says quickly, \u201c\u2019S\u2019just Derek and me, doin\u2019\u2014uh\u2014inventory?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, gross, do it somewhere else,\u201d Scott grumbles, rolling over to face the wall and letting out a loud snore.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart two begins,\u201d Stiles murmurs in a dramatic voice, popping his marker cap and hovering over Scott. Derek forgets it\u2019s obvious where he\u2019s looking with the torch on top of his head, and Stiles blinks in the bright light. \u201cDude, I\u2019m being blinded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek mumbles, looking quickly down at the cast. \u201c\u2019S\u2019it dry yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoon, oh, man I can\u2019t wait to see the look on his face. Draw more hearts,\u201d Stiles elbows him again, \u201cOne with Finstock\u2019s name in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek chokes back a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat. The. Hell?!\u201d Scott screeches as he flies into the ER where Stiles and Derek are sitting at the desk, tossing MnMs between them. Stiles catches one in his mouth with relish, twists to smile brightly at his best friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cScotty! Thought you\u2019d never wake up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he looks so adorable,\u201d Allison hums, taking in Scott wrapped in a pink arm cast, and with pink and purple streaks in his hair. Stiles has even drawn huge eyelashes on his friend\u2019s face. He snaps a picture with his phone, grins at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look <em>beautiful</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doctors,\u201d Scott yells. \u201cYou should be responsible!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWin for <em>Team Stilinski</em>,\u201d Stiles crows, standing and flipping the chart board to add a line to the tally he and Scott keep in the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have too much time on your hands, don\u2019t you have dates you could be going on if you\u2019ve got nothing better to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, Scott, that was our date,\u201d Stiles clasps his hands together, \u201cSo romantic, the dark surrounding us, Derek\u2019s chiselled jaw close to mine, you snoring in the background.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky I\u2019m off tonight,\u201d Scott huffs crossly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Allison tugs on his arm, \u201cI\u2019ll get the saw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s cross face vanishes in an instant, \u201cOh, thanks, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh, though, I do think we should keep the cast,\u201d Allison examines it more closely, \u201cThat\u2019s a very accurate portrait of Derek\u2019s eyebrows for someone to do in the dark,\u201d she flashes a look at Stiles, and Stiles throws a paperclip after them.</p>\n<p>Scott twists as Allison starts pulling the curtains round a nearby bed, fist pumps the air and points at Stiles, \u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d he mouths.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles spins on his chair, wiggles his eyebrows at Derek, \u201cFunny how that worked out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou planned that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly, but hey, it gave my boy an excuse to bother Allison at work when she normally doesn\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very strange brand of genius,\u201d Derek says drily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 that as a compliment,\u201d Stiles rolls off his chair, grabs Derek\u2019s arm, \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go see how our interns are faring with the waiting room.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Erica hums loudly, eyes Stiles and Boyd across the lab tables. \u201cSo, you two having fun together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA tremendous amount,\u201d Boyd says without looking up from his petri dish.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re beside ourselves with glee,\u201d Stiles adds, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell?\u201d They both look up at her with the exact same flat expression and Derek hides a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cEerie,\u201d she says brightly. \u201cDr Stilinski\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek makes a pained noise, \u201cErica.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa,\u201d Stiles crows, threads a needle through a banana he\u2019s stitching, \u201cMine is way more awesome than yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d Boyd huffs, and Stiles holds up his hands in apology.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was giving you a compliment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompliment me when I\u2019m done,\u201d Boyd says firmly, \u201cOr, critique it,\u201d he sits back, gazing sullenly at his work, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look right to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles prods at the skin gently with his probe, \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd smiles, and Derek realizes it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s truly seen the guy\u2019s teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna give <em>me</em> a compliment, Dr Hale?\u201d Erica purrs, winking at him.</p>\n<p>Derek feels his mouth fall open as Stiles looks between them, eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you aren\u2019t even fun to mess with, you look so panicked,\u201d Erica staples her findings together, hands them all to Derek. \u201cBoyd, you wanna grab lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Boyd dusts his hands off, \u201cThanks Dr Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problemo,\u201d Stiles cocks a finger gun at him, \u201cYou\u2019re my star.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd stops grinning and glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles says meekly. \u201cYou have room for improvement?\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd rolls his eyes, bounds after Erica, who begins complaining loudly about Derek the second they\u2019re out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re so fun!\u201d Stiles exclaims, \u201cAnd Erica, huh? She, uh, she got a little crush goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pushes his glasses up, circles an error in Erica\u2019s notes, \u201cYes, she asked if you were single on her first day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles chokes on air, \u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve it or not, Stiles, you are, according to Erica,\u201d Derek peers at him over his glasses, \u201cHot stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 cheeks go pink, and he rocks back on his heels, shoves his hands in his pockets, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s against the rules to date any of them,\u201d Derek says gently, trying not to die inside.</p>\n<p>Stiles cuts him an incredulous look. \u201cI don\u2019t want to date her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em>you</em> think I\u2019m hot?\u201d Stiles cuts in.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not without your merits,\u201d Derek says, giving Stiles an assessing gaze he <em>hopes</em> looks like he\u2019s considering Stiles\u2019 attractiveness for the first time, and not that he could no doubt describe Stiles\u2019 face down to the positioning of every mole Derek wants to <em>lick, </em>should a court artist need a description.</p>\n<p>\u201cShucks,\u201d Stiles drawls. \u201cWhat a compliment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, slams his files together and tosses them in the corner. \u201cCome on, pretty boy, I\u2019ll buy you an egg salad sandwich.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy, you know just how to treat a man right,\u201d Stiles simpers, clutching his hands together and following Derek out into the corridor.</p>\n<p>They both stop short in front of Finstock, clearly trying to enter the lab. He looks at Derek, pulling on his jacket, at Stiles who\u2019s flushed and still grinning from mocking Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t create a lawsuit, anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChief\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI lost in the damn pool,\u201d he mutters, striding past them. \u201cYou two couldn\u2019t have done this eleven months ago?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d they both gawk at him, and he slams the lab door in their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Stiles scratches the back of his neck, \u201cWouldn\u2019t have expected him to\u2014did he say there\u2019s some sort of pool?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Scott crunches down on a celery stick when they confront him twenty minutes later. \u201cIsaac, Lydia, Greenberg, Danny\u2026 pretty much everyone\u2019s out except me and Allison.\u201d He smiles dreamily. \u201cShe\u2019s so wise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be dating a guy with no balls,\u201d Stiles threatens, \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to mention the fact you\u2019ve no doubt been cheating, seeing as you have insider information,\u201d Derek adds. \u201cThough, that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re mad about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of is actually,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully, snapping his fingers together, \u201cDo we get the money now we know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott scowls, \u201cYou\u2019re not married, yet. There\u2019s been no romantic reunion at an airport, no rooftop confessions\u2014Finstock\u2019s choice of situation, by the way, I thought it was super romantic\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Derek groans, \u201cI\u2019m not part of your stupid prank club. This isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of is,\u201d Stiles argues, \u201cIf you squint, and\u2014\u201d he grabs Scott\u2019s banana, holds it in front of his face, \u201cGive us the money in the pool, and we\u2019ll pretend this never happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone clears their throat behind them, and they all turn to glower at Jackson Whittemore.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate to interrupt your very <em>important</em> doctors meeting, but could anyone tell me where Dr Martin is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a <em>doctors</em> meeting,\u201d Stiles snaps, waving the banana around, \u201cGod, could you be more condescending?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Jackson glances at his nails, flashes them a grin, \u201cDr Martin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUpstairs, out onto the roof, over the side,\u201d Stiles smiles widely at him, \u201cYou should spot her easily enough on your way down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitty,\u201d Jackson says dismissively as he turns to leave, \u201cHale, tell your sister I said hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tries to launch himself at Jackson, and Stiles grabs his arm, \u201cWoah, dude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate that guy,\u201d Scott blurts out after a moment, reaching for his chocolate milk.</p>\n<p>Stiles pats him on the back consolingly, \u201cRemember when Isaac pantsed him at the Christmas party last year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s face lights up, and Derek rolls his eyes affectionately, pulling out his phone just to check Jackson\u2019s screwing with him.</p>\n<p>Cora texts him back an hour later, <strong>FUCK U. Y WUD U EVEN, U R THE WORST.</strong></p>\n<p>Stiles points out it clearly runs in the Hale family to skip on using lowercase for texting, and Derek throws his phone at his head.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles has the uncanny ability of being able to fall asleep anywhere. Over the years they\u2019ve known each other, Derek has kept a casual list in his head of the strangest places. His head lolled onto Derek\u2019s shoulder during one of the hospital\u2019s terrible, never to be spoken of again, Christmas shows about three years ago; he\u2019s been found snoozing in the elevator; on the <em>roof</em>; he once fell asleep with his hand still clutching a fork in the cafeteria \u2014only to snap awake when Lydia tried to less than stealthily steal the rest of his chocolate fudge cake. Derek\u2019s favorite time was at Allison\u2019s birthday party last year, when Stiles fell asleep sprawled across Derek\u2019s lap, and curved his arms round Derek\u2019s waist, face buried in his stomach. He\u2019d had an entire conversation with Scott as Stiles had snored between them, Scott hadn\u2019t even flinched.</p>\n<p>Derek is pinning that down to a testament of how close Scott and Stiles are, not about how their friends have become used to Stiles and Derek\u2019s sometimes tactile behaviour. Besides, they\u2019re colleagues, they\u2019re\u2026 friends. They\u2019re close. They\u2019re allowed to be close, <em>professionally</em> so.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s known Stiles years, and he\u2019d trust him with anything\u2026 It\u2019s <em>that</em> more than anything that made Derek realize just how far in he was. They were arguing about a case in the elevator, and Stiles had snapped his file shut, leant against the back wall with a shrug and told Derek to trust him, that he had this. Derek had muttered that he did trust Stiles, and they\u2019d both sort of started, and gone separate ways as soon as the doors opened. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The best part of the sleeping thing, though, because his point is, that you often can\u2019t tell. Stiles is sitting beside Derek now, hand scrawling what, to the casual beholder would think were notes, but are actually, if you lean a little closer, circles.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re at the M &amp; M session and Finstock\u2019s wrapping up a case. He peers out into the audience and his eyes zero in on Stiles. As subtly as possible Derek tries to nudge him awake; Stiles doesn\u2019t stir.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Stilinski, did you have anything further you wanted to add on why Dr Benton\u2019s approach to patient nine- forty seven was perhaps not the best course of action.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winces, waiting for Stiles to start awake and apologize.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t lift his head, but he does flip his page back to the essay of notes he\u2019s been secretly writing, <em>bastard</em> and clears his throat. \u201cOnly that in post op the patient\u2019s infection was noticeable to several nurses, one of whom commented on it and marked it in the chart, but was ignored. Perhaps Dr Benton needs to pay a little more attention to his nurses, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Benton swivels round from where he\u2019s sitting three rows in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sticks his pen in his mouth and smiles around it, gives a casual shrug as the lecture theatre starts buzzing around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I need someone who patches up <em>boo boos</em> for a living to offer an opinion on how to look after my patients, I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Benton snaps finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch, Benton, that really cut deep, I should go get a Band-Aid for that burn before it gets infected and you miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Finstock bangs his head on the podium briefly before straightening up, his hair higher than ever. \u201cI don\u2019t want two of my top doctors bickering at each other like they\u2019re in a high school locker room! Shut the hell up so we can move on already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Benton glares murderously at Stiles for another minute and Stiles grins coolly back at him. Finally, he turns round and folds his arms, looking for all the world like one of the five year olds Derek has to deliver shots to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you shouldn\u2019t wind him up,\u201d Derek mutters as Finstock starts talking about maintenance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a dickwad though, dude. And Allison <em>told</em> him about it and he fucking ignored her.\u201d Stiles squirms in his seat as though indignant all over again and Derek places a hand on his thigh to still him. It\u2019s more to keep the other doctors around them from staring, but the second his palm stretches over Stiles\u2019 leg, Stiles immediately stills. Derek can feel the heat radiating off him and he wants to tighten his grip, slide his hand upwards, push it inside Stiles\u2019 smart dress pants and wrap his hands around\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Martin,\u201d Finstock yells and Lydia looks up coolly from where she\u2019s been taking notes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Derek blinks away his daydreams of Stiles naked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny thoughts on patient 342?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly that had Thompson been sent to me instead of to Dr Lewis he might have lived,\u201d Lydia says easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot good enough!\u201d Finstock cries, looking frustrated. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing the hospital lawyer in this afternoon and you and Lewis will both be present for the discussion. The family are not happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia loudly protests, but Derek\u2019s too distracted to listen as Stiles drops his hand on top of Derek\u2019s and starts drawing aimless patterns across his skin.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t looking at him, eyes fixed on Lydia, but when Derek shifts in his seat Stiles\u2019 fingers tighten around his.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, this is riveting,\u201d he hisses to Derek out of the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t do more than exhale crossly.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShush!\u201d</p>\n<p>Finstock and Lydia\u2019s voices get louder, before Finstock slams his files down and Lydia flounces back in her seat, glaring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking to the lawyer, Martin, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to be helpful,\u201d Finstock points at her. \u201cNo re-directing him to Marin\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarin can handle Jackson Whittemore,\u201d Lydia says tetchily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d Marin Morrell says from three rows back, and when Derek twists to look at her, Stiles\u2019 hand slips off his. \u201cBut, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she adds silkily. \u201cHe\u2019s a waste of my time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do your next three weekends,\u201d Lydia offers.</p>\n<p>Marin smirks, \u201cNo deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo bribery!\u201d Finstock snaps crabbily. \u201cThis is a hospital not a\u2014a\u2014betting pool!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Stiles coughs, and Finstock glares at him, then smiles nastily.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh crap,\u201d Stiles mutters, sinking down in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski, come talk to me about overtime. Everyone else clear out, you\u2019re fine doctors and I\u2019m extremely proud of our low mortality rate this year, now get out of my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves a hand to dismiss them all, yells for Stiles to come to the front again, and Stiles shoots Derek a wistful smile, bites his lip as he backs away.</p>\n<p>Derek has to stay in his seat for a moment to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Martin, we need to talk about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m your lawyer; I need for you to cooperate with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia twirls round in her heels and positively burns holes through Jackson\u2019s skull with her glare. Derek is impressed he doesn\u2019t even flinch, merely slides his hands into his pockets and stares impassively back at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, <em>Mr</em> Whittemore, where did you graduate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cColumbus,\u201d he says easily, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cTop of my class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw <em>man</em>, we should totally have popcorn,\u201d Stiles whispers to him from where he\u2019s leaning over the desk.</p>\n<p>Derek spins in his chair to look up at him and is suddenly grateful there\u2019s the desk between them because Stiles is so <em>very</em> close. Half an hour later, and they haven\u2019t addressed whatever happened during the M &amp; M, instead they\u2019re messing about at the nurse\u2019s station and avoiding rounds. It\u2019s not that Derek\u2019s afraid of Erica, it\u2019s just that\u2026 he\u2019d rather spend his time gazing like a morose idiot at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have an endless supply of candy hidden away somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scrunches his nose up. \u201cNot that I can get to without missing something. Bets on them kissing before the end of the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts and glances back over to where Lydia is in full rant mode, tossing her hair and practically snarling, and Jackson\u2019s looking calmly back at her, occasionally pushing his glasses back up his nose.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the kind of casual arrogance that would absolutely infuriate Lydia.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance, she\u2019ll make him work for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess the best ones are always worth waiting for,\u201d Stiles says softly.</p>\n<p>Derek whips his head round again, but Stiles is staring intently at a pamphlet for how to handle STDs, the tips of his ears red.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says faintly before whipping the pamphlet away gleefully. \u201cSomething I should know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles practically falls over the desk trying to snatch it back. \u201cNo! I\u2019m a doctor I know about safe sex, bastard. Besides, in order for me to have one of those I\u2019d have to be having sex, Jesus.\u201d He snatches the pamphlet back, his face bright red before screwing it up in a ball and throwing it at Derek\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s too busy feeling pleasantly, oddly warmed by the fact Stiles isn\u2019t sleeping with someone. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019d know about it, Stiles can\u2019t keep anything secret for long, but it\u2019s nice to have it confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Lydia cries hotly from the end of the corridor before stalking away.</p>\n<p>Jackson watches her go looking vaguely amused. He strolls casually towards them, eyes flitting over their scrubs, mouth curling up in a disdainful smirk when he takes in Stiles\u2019 farmyard animal ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow where I can find a decent cup of coffee in this place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDecent? Nope,\u201d Stiles says easily, folding another of the pamphlets into a paper airplane and launching it at Derek\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Jackson makes a put upon noise and snatches the plane mid-air. \u201cI hate doctors,\u201d he grouses, tossing the paper in the trash as he stalks off.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad you work for a bunch of them, then!\u201d Stiles calls after him.</p>\n<p>After a moment of levity, Stiles clears his throat, glances at Derek. \u201cLook, about earlier\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles bites his lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was tired, I forgot that\u2014\u201d he scrunches up his face, \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m with you I forget that we\u2019re just\u2014that we just work together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek feels like maybe someone\u2019s punched him in the solar plexus. \u201cYeah,\u201d he coughs, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it; Derek, your face is doing that weird thing\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean being my face?\u201d Derek rolls off his chair and strides towards the paeds unit, \u201cI have rounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, for god\u2019s sake\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later, Dr Stilinski,\u201d he snaps. Stiles jerks his head back, stares at Derek with confused, wide eyes. Derek knows it\u2019s childish, but he needs to put some distance between them, and unless he hits where it hurts, Stiles will follow him and pester his feelings out of him. The same way he made the damn things creep up on Derek in the first place.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChinese,\u201d Derek holds up the bag, looks at Stiles apologetically from under his lashes. \u201cFor yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took you twenty four hours to work out how to say sorry with food? How long have you known me again?\u201d Stiles kicks the door wide, ushers Derek inside. \u201cHave you showered today, or were you too busy wallowing in angst at the idea of never speaking to me again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, kicks off his shoes as he follows Stiles into the apartment he shares with Scott. \u201cNever speaking to you again? Sounds ideal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Stiles yanks open one of the cabinets in the tiny kitchen, pulls down two plates and waves one at Derek, \u201cAnd yet here you are at my door step, begging my forgiveness with your sad eyes and your deliciousness\u2014delicious food,\u201d he corrects immediately, cheeks flushing up.</p>\n<p>Derek hips checks the fridge shut, proffers a beer at Stiles. \u201cYou done?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the hell up, I\u2019m not even half started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLemme know when you\u2019re good to eat,\u201d Derek says easily, padding into the living room, and sitting on a slumbering Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmff, dude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Chinese,\u201d Derek says instead of a hello, and Scott yanks his legs from under Derek, dives for the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get egg rolls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like he loves us,\u201d Stiles says fondly, his eyes on Derek as Scott dashes past him and into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Derek pretends to be struggling to pick up his noodles with his chopsticks, <em>pretends</em> his face isn\u2019t burning. \u201cIf you two weren\u2019t around, who would take on Lydia with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d do okay,\u201d Stiles curls into the armchair opposite Derek, eyes serious and intense.</p>\n<p>Derek takes a nervous pull of his beer to prevent himself from leaping at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, d\u2019you hear the big news?\u201d Stiles says after a moment of nothing but the two of them looking at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? Something important?\u201d Derek selfishly hopes more than anything it\u2019s not that Stiles has gone out and found himself a soul mate.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur Scott\u2019s gonna ask Allison to marry him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek widens his eyes, and looks up as Scott comes back out into the living room. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Scott gives him a shit eating grin, \u201cI just figured I love her so much, you know? She\u2019s the <em>one</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d Stiles interrupts, \u201cYou came to this conclusion after <em>two</em> years. I could have told you the first day you guys <em>met</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s not four and a half,\u201d Scott sing songs, digging into his egg roll.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face colors, and he turns to the television. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019not,\u201d Scott says with a full mouth, and Derek winces at the close up view he\u2019s getting of Scott\u2019s food. \u201c\u2019S\u2019love, and you gotta strike when the iron\u2019s hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been like this all day,\u201d Stiles confides in Derek, \u201cSmug and knowing and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels right,\u201d Scott interrupts, \u201cAnd when you seize the moment, you\u2019ll know, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you supposed to be seizing the moment with?\u201d Derek asks politely, glancing at Stiles over his beer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Stiles leans across the table and pushes Derek\u2019s glasses up for him, \u201cShut up and eat your food before it gets cold, loser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek looks down at his plate, grinning bashfully at the way Stiles\u2019 fingers had brushed down his face. He shouldn\u2019t get goose bumps from it, but he does. When he glances up, Stiles is looking back at him, a smile playing around his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven for being a huffy douche,\u201d he says lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Derek retorts drily, but allows Scott to stretch out over him and Stiles choose the channel.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up, Scott\u2019s drooling on his chest, and Stiles is passed out opposite him, Derek\u2019s glasses between his fingers like he took them off and fell asleep still holding onto them for Derek. He rolls over onto his side, blinks sleepily at Derek. Scott snuffles against Derek\u2019s chest, and Stiles sniggers at the look of outrage that must be on Derek\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek mouths.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe loves you so much,\u201d Stiles whispers back, clutching his hands to his chest.</p>\n<p>Derek tries to sit up, and Scott whines, clings to Derek\u2019s undershirt tightly.</p>\n<p>Stiles stuffs his hand in his mouth; and Derek can\u2019t help but delight over feeling conspiratorial with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Stiles says a little more loudly after a second, scratching at his stomach, and Derek nods, looks away. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get changed, brush the crap out of my mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou paint a delightful picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flips him off, \u201cBe nice, or you don\u2019t get coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Derek\u2019s pager goes off, and Scott growls loudly, rolls off Derek and buries himself between the couch cushions and Derek\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn it <em>off</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a three second delay, and then Scott and Stiles\u2019 pagers both start buzzing.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Scott sits bolt upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cMass casualty,\u201d Stiles squints at his pager, flicks on the news and Derek\u2019s distracted for more than a moment by the fact Stiles has tried to change between the living room and the kitchen, and is missing his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles groans as shots of a pile up on the highway swim into focus.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d Scott yanks on his sneakers, ducks to look under the couch and snatches up his phone. Stiles nods, disappears into his bedroom before flying back out seconds later, yanking on a shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles waves a shirt at him, \u201cYou comin\u2019 in with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek clears his throat, follows them both towards the front door and trips blindly over a stray sneaker.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbass,\u201d Stiles says fondly, handing him his glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles smiles slowly at him, and it feels so fucking familiar, so like a routine that hits Derek like a freight train. He stills in the doorway, Scott and Stiles clattering down the stairs in front of him. He <em>wants</em> this in his life, every day, Scott sharing his last egg roll, and Stiles making sure Derek has his glasses and a million nights lying awake with the two of them, with Isaac and sometimes Allison and Lydia, the little family he built, he wants to be a unit with Stiles, a separate one where they have their own moments and then blend in with their family the way they already do. He wants <em>more</em>. He needs this to be a reality, wants to keep this intimacy forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, get your stupid butt out here!\u201d Scott screeches from the car, honking the horn.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice, Stilinski,\u201d Scott and Stiles\u2019 neighbour leans out of her window two across as Derek flies after them. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever hit that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Loranne,\u201d Stiles hisses, slamming the door shut as she replies.</p>\n<p>Derek lifts a quizzical eyebrow, and Stiles focuses on rubbing Scott\u2019s shoulders, \u201cGet us there in one piece, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen have I ever failed you?\u201d Scott asks huffily, reversing into a garbage can.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cGreen; walking wounded, yellow; urgent, red; critical and black DOA,\u201d Derek informs Erica, handing her tags. \u201cYou got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d she glances round the ER, thin lipped, \u201cIs it gonna get worse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForty five injured, called in from the fire department, more people trapped in their cars, still,\u201d Derek nods, \u201cA lot worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she seems to steel herself as the doors swing open with the first casualties, \u201cAny last minute advice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall over,\u201d Derek calls over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s going to get slippery, blood and snow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see why you wear such ugly shoes now,\u201d she says grimly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlood bank, come in, this is Stilinski in the ER,\u201d Stiles sails past them, \u201cNo, no, I need those for Trauma Two. Has anyone seen my intern?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, boss,\u201d Boyd rolls in with a gurney, \u201cSorry, the snow made it a little tricky to get in,\u201d he\u2019s got his hands wrapped in a sweater\u2014his own if the thin t-shirt he\u2019s sporting is anything to go by\u2014and it\u2019s pressed on top of a wound on the patient\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven,\u201d Stiles says easily, \u201cGet him into Trauma One.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I run it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Hale!\u201d Derek twists, Allison waves him over as Ethan starts administering compressions on a man, clambering onto the gurney.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you got? Reyes,\u201d he calls, and Erica flies over to his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty five year old male, wasn\u2019t wearing a seat belt when his car collided with a lorry, he coded in the rig.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what you can,\u201d Derek gestures for Erica to take over, \u201cAnd then move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he codes again, call it,\u201d he tells Allison, manoeuvring round a woman in a wheelchair clutching a bandage to her head. \u201cGreen tag this one, move her to the waiting room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac pushes past with a gurney, yells for Derek and he follows into Trauma Three.</p>\n<p>\u201cLift and shift her, get some rays and relief, morphine five, IV push. Cross table C-Spine,\u201d he feels gently around the patient\u2019s side, \u201cRight hip, and pelvis.\u201d He glances up and nods at a nearby nurse, \u201cRound up a bone crusher. Someone grab my intern, she won\u2019t want to miss this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica appears a few moments later, and Derek points at the trays behind her, \u201cGrab some scissors. Watch closely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHale,\u201d Finstock looks round the door, \u201cHow soon can she go up? I\u2019ve got more traumas that need the room clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to look at her pictures, have orthopods look at her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get fancy on me, Hale, OR\u2019s open and ready for business, heal \u2018em and wheel \u2018em,\u201d he instructs before disappearing again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, you heard him,\u201d Derek shoves his gown off, sees Stiles through the glass and heads out to the curtained area, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a kid with no parents,\u201d Stiles ducks to examine the little girl\u2019s face and she reaches out to tweak Stiles\u2019 nose. Derek ignores the hiccough his heart gives.</p>\n<p>Allison smiles fondly at the scene, \u201cNinety over fifty, pulse a hundred and twenty five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky,\u201d Derek breathes in surprise, \u201cShe was by herself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles pulls his stethoscope off. \u201cBut, no one\u2019s come forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet Ethan to stay with her,\u201d Derek advises as Scott waves across the ER.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got? Reyes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Erica says immediately from beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cVitals normal,\u201d Scott starts as they begin to wheel the gurney down the corridor, \u201cMultiple contusions and abrasions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Derek presses against the latest patient\u2019s chest, \u201cMr?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLowkins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Lowkins does it hurt when I do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2014\u201d Allison shouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne sec,\u201d he glances in Mr Lowkins\u2019 eyes, \u201cGreen tag him, waiting room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d Erica asks as they stride across to Allison.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have the time or the luxury not to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I don\u2019t feel like I can give an accurate assessment and be one hundred per cent about it. Doctor Hale\u2014\u201d Erica bites her lip, and Derek twists to look at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d he promises, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t I\u2019d have got you on bedpan duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she mutters, but when she follows Derek round the next patient\u2019s bed, he can almost see a twitch of relief, perhaps even respect for <em>Derek</em>, in her expression.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDominic!\u201d Derek pretends to frown at his young patient as he enters Dominic Mayetta\u2019s room a few days later. \u201cI thought I told you I never wanted to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dominic gives him a toothy grin as his mom stands to shake Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cSorry, Dr Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crouches in front of him, tries to blithely ignore Dominic\u2019s obvious fatigue and the pallor of his skin. The Valvulor Stenosis is starting to seriously affect his circulation, and Dominic looks worse than Derek\u2019s ever seen him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019okay, champ,\u201d he mutters, helping Dominic into a gown, \u201cYou know we like takin\u2019 care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDominic!\u201d Allison bustles into the room with an IV drip, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m five, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look at least eight,\u201d Allison says warmly, touching Mrs Mayetta\u2019s arm on her way past. \u201cAnything we can get you, Olly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVicodin?\u201d Olly says with a tired grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about a coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Olly squeezes Allison\u2019s hand, ducks to help Derek lift Dominic onto the bed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t wake up this morning,\u201d she says to Derek quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek promises, \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he chances a smile of his own, and Olly visibly relaxes, sits down to look at Dominic\u2019s collection of birds with him.</p>\n<p>Derek swallows at the familiar scene. Dominic\u2019s been in and out of the ward since he was a baby, and he was one of Derek\u2019s first patients here. He can\u2019t concentrate on any outcome other than the one that has Dominic walking out of those doors, healthy again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance, Derek,\u201d Stiles says quiet, but firm, ten minutes later as they\u2019re leaning against the glass outside of Dominic\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, you\u2019re not on this case, no way. Let Danny take it, now. Walk away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting Mahealani anywhere near this kid,\u201d Derek hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen me,\u201d Stiles says shortly, \u201cBut, you\u2019re way too involved already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known him since he was five months old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Stiles sighs, pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cLast time he was in you didn\u2019t speak to anyone for a week, and I\u2019m pretty sure the dent in your locker is from your fist over the situation. Derek, you can\u2019t consult on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Derek snaps, trying to snatch the chart away from Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, no!\u201d Stiles shoves the chart behind his back, arches his eyebrows at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit, Stiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou gonna body tackle me for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might,\u201d Derek warns, his patience thinning in the face of Stiles\u2019 distance, the way he\u2019s treating this like any other case, like this isn\u2019t <em>important</em> to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my boss, Stiles,\u201d Derek says coolly, \u201cNor are you my superior, I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. Give me the chart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re too invested\u2014look at yourself. The kid\u2019s only been here five minutes and you look like you\u2019re trying to crawl out of your skin. You can\u2019t fix everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can fix him,\u201d Derek barks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek steps into Stiles\u2019 space, shoves him up against the wall. \u201cGive me the chart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it from me,\u201d Stiles retorts, meeting Derek\u2019s eye firmly. He leans forward, there\u2019s barely a breath between them, \u201cI dare you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing games.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Stiles says firmly, \u201cBack off. Let me do my job, go get a coffee or something, Jesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pushes at Derek\u2019s chest, and Derek lets him, steps away feeling horrified at himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles mumbles, stalking past and opening the door to Dominic\u2019s room. \u201cHello there, I hear someone\u2019s feelin\u2019 under the weather, you bring some sunshine, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek listens to Dominic crow happily as Stiles greets him, and leans his head against the wall. He needs to get a grip.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Erica shudders when Stiles stalks past them and on to his own locker two days later.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, did you tell him he couldn\u2019t top for a week?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you make inappropriate comments on purpose?\u201d Derek snaps, whipping his glasses off so he doesn\u2019t have to watch Stiles yank on his jacket and leave without looking back.</p>\n<p>Erica tips her head to one side, considers the question. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m writing your evaluation as we speak,\u201d Derek says drily. \u201cTry to remember that when you\u2019re making ill-advised remarks about my sex life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNon-<em>existent</em> sex life,\u201d she corrects.</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth to huff <em>something</em>, when his pager goes off, and Erica\u2019s smirk dies.</p>\n<p>\u201cNoo, that means me too, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Derek shoves his bag back in his locker, trying not to feel overly gleeful about not having to return to his empty apartment, and watch the clock until his next shift.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I have plans,\u201d she whines, following him out of the room and sweeping up her hair, \u201cDrinking plans!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins toothily at her. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be such a loser if you\u2019re excited about going to the ER on a Friday night,\u201d Erica snarks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m your <em>superior</em>, at least try to act like that means something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica folds her arms as they head out into the ambulance bay, \u201cWill you admit Dr Stilinski\u2019s mad at you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn exchange for your silence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Derek snaps on his gloves as the van pulls up, Scott leaping out to give them an update. \u201cSnake bite, delivered the anti-venom, but still shortness of breath, dizziness, name\u2019s Alice Featherly, six, Isaac\u2019s got the snake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReyes, take the snake off Isaac for examination, follow us in when you\u2019ve got in touch with animal control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to take the snake?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Derek rolls the gurney in through the doors with Scott, timing the little girl\u2019s pulse. \u201cThe hell was she doing near a snake?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad has a collection,\u201d Scott pulls a face, \u201cWas gruesome, man, Stiles wouldda loved it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRadical,\u201d Derek retorts waspishly, and Scott rolls his eyes, stepping back as Allison and Ethan sail in to help move the girl.</p>\n<p>\u201cSort it out, man, he\u2019s getting unbearable to live with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Derek says shortly, pulling up a sheet list of snakes. \u201cReyes, do you have a confirmed name for the snake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t touch it!\u201d Erica shrieks from the next room. \u201cIt\u2019s a <em>snake</em>, Dr Hale!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to touch it, <em>google</em> it, Christ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Rattlesnake,\u201d says a woman from the doors of the trauma room. \u201cOh god, Alice, baby, how many times has your daddy told you not to go near the glass?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek disposes of the secondary anti-venom needle, and whirls to stare at her incredulously. \u201cYou let your husband keep snakes in the same house as your six year old?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re always locked up,\u201d she wrings her hands, \u201cOne\u2019s never got out before. Please, is she going to be alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Derek ducks into the second trauma room where Erica\u2019s still eyeing the box with the snake in. \u201cLeave this here with me, go call child services.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to be there at seven on a Friday evening, Dr Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust do it, ring until someone answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re not getting any this weekend, doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Derek says again in a dark voice, and something in his tone must convince her he\u2019s serious as she backs out of the door, and leaves Derek glaring down at the snake.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, Cora bangs into the ER, and glares at Derek over the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? A snake bite, Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s in danger, her mom can\u2019t see it, you need to talk to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to get a life,\u201d she snaps, chucking at his chin sharply as she passes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, her I like,\u201d Erica murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a nice person,\u201d Derek says, loud enough for his sister to hear, and she flips him off as she makes her way over to the curtains around the Featherley\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Erica glances at the sign in sheet. \u201cShe\u2019s related to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I say about personal questions?\u201d Derek rubs his face, tosses his glasses to one side. \u201cGo home, Reyes, we have rounds in four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI covered the ER, and I have to come in again in the morning anyway?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Derek slams the latest chart down in her lap. \u201cWelcome to being an intern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d she calls after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell someone who cares.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sleeps in the break room, wakes to Scott half passed out on top of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s sad,\u201d Scott snuffles sleepily, as Derek stretches, reaches for one of the clean shirts he keeps hanging in the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot my fault,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>Scott rolls his eyes, \u201cYou need to shave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Derek grabs his lab coat, ruffles Scott\u2019s hair the way he loathes, \u201cYou need a haircut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me some money for one!\u201d Scott yells as the door swings shut.</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, a small, rueful smile forming as he slides into the elevator. He doesn\u2019t even realize he has company before the doors shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you look like hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek starts, glances to the side as he clutches his chest. \u201cJesus, Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Stiles, but formerly yes, yes I am Jesus,\u201d Stiles continues watching the elevator\u2019s numbers light up, seems to be refusing to look at Derek.</p>\n<p>It hurts more than he\u2019d care to admit. He rolls back his shoulders, pretends he\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of us were in the ER all night.\u201d Stiles exhales sharply, and Derek sighs. \u201cSorry, that was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sure, some of us are obviously <em>real</em> doctors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, d\u2019you want to follow me around all day to make sure I do everything to your satisfaction for Dominic\u2019s case? Or can you trust me with this one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d Derek blurts out, \u201cBut, this kid is personal, he\u2019s special, he doesn\u2019t deserve this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs, slams on the emergency break for the elevator, \u201cFour months after I started working here, I had that case, what was her name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElla March,\u201d Derek says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles jerks his head, bites his lip, \u201cYou remember? I remember, too. I remember you telling me not to make friends with her mom, and not to make promises I couldn\u2019t keep, and I remember wanting to prove you wrong, that I could do it all. I remember getting so far in I didn\u2019t sleep for three days, and it was you that made me go home and shower, and you that told me, what, Derek? What did <em>you</em> tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your <em>life</em>,\u201d Derek intones dully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna die, Derek,\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice cracks, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to face that, please\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek straightens from where he\u2019s fallen back against the wall, cuts off the alarm, \u201cHe\u2019s not,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows Stiles is watching him as they finish the journey in silence, at the last moment, before the doors open he sighs and drops his head forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d he says finally, brushing his fingers against Stiles\u2019 briefly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I need that case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Stiles says softly. \u201cDerek\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give it to me, <em>please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, nods, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek exhales, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t <em>thank</em> me.\u201d When the doors open he pulls his hand away and doesn\u2019t look back.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Lydia shakes her head, even as Derek continues to approach her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019ve tried, it\u2019s not my trial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is, you know you\u2019re doing all the work, Harris wouldn\u2019t even notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie, you know he would. He\u2019s a fantastic surgeon, but he\u2019s an awful, egotistical man, and he\u2019d notice. He won\u2019t allow Dominic on his trail\u2014his results\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be taking over from in him in a few years, you could call the shots on this one,\u201d he waves Dominic\u2019s file at her. \u201cHave you even read the notes? The stenosis was congenital, you\u2019re looking for reasons why, his mom will tell you anything, give you access to her history\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lydia hisses, \u201cI\u2019ll try. But, Stiles is right,\u201d she blinks in surprise at herself, and then glares at Derek, \u201cYou\u2019re pushing with this one, too hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek insists, \u201cI\u2019m being motivational.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing overly involved, and motivational are two different things,\u201d Lydia snipes, holding up her own version of Dominic\u2019s file. \u201cYou left this on my desk this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a spare,\u201d he says stiffly.</p>\n<p>Lydia snorts, \u201cDerek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, it might be that I\u2019m in too deep, but if it can help the kid, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to shave,\u201d Lydia says in reply, \u201cYou look awful. No wonder Stiles is moping up here so much at the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have any idea as to why that would be related to my needing to shave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia cups his jaw, considers him, \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI look fabulous,\u201d she dismisses, and Derek can\u2019t really deny it. He doesn\u2019t know how she walks into the hospital looking so put together, and leaves it in the same fashion.</p>\n<p>Witchcraft, probably.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting food,\u201d Lydia picks up her jacket, \u201cYou\u2019re coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat, but I need someone to witness my decision not to eat the Christmas Yule log the cafeteria has on offer, and admire my strong will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins, \u201cI\u2019ll go halves with you on a piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds appealing,\u201d Lydia nods, \u201cShall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Derek digs his fork into the seriously decadent chocolate yule, \u201cAre you worried about the board?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Lydia purses her lips, \u201cI think they want me to apologize to the family, and I\u2019m happy to do that. It\u2019s really more them trying to get Jackson Whittemore involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou not warmed up to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI find him supremely irritating,\u201d Lydia sighs, brushes imaginary crumbs off her skirt, \u201cBut, he\u2019s not going anywhere, and I don\u2019t know how to convince them I don\u2019t need his help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hunches up his shoulders, \u201cShow them you\u2019re better than him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy being yourself,\u201d Derek smirks, \u201cAlways works when you\u2019re putting us in our places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all afraid of me,\u201d she says dismissively.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Lydia narrows her eyes dangerously, \u201cI know all your secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was it that left a very drunk voicemail on Stiles\u2019 phone last New Year\u2019s? And begged me to delete it for him in a panic? Someone that talked about his ass a lot in the message,\u201d Lydia taps her chin as Derek drops his fork.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou listened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d she helps herself to more yule log on Derek\u2019s side. \u201cBut, Jackson hasn\u2019t left any incriminating voicemails\u2026 That I know of. Maybe I could get hold of his cell phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia,\u201d Derek shakes his head, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to blackmail him to get him off your back. You\u2019re a bonafide genius, you could wipe the floor with him in a court of law, and you\u2019ve never been to law school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen,\u201d Derek picks his fork back up, \u201cDon\u2019t back down. Don\u2019t let Jackson Whittemore decide what\u2019s best for you, or call the shots with <em>your</em> cases.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Lydia nods, eyes gazing into the distance, \u201cI\u2019m going to make him rue the day he was born.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d Derek waves his fork approvingly at her.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Scott, Danny and Isaac all lift their heads in acknowledgement when Derek trudges into the break room late one morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, scrubs at his face, \u201cAnyone heard about Lydia\u2019s presentation with the board?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe told them all to go to hell,\u201d Danny smirks, \u201cThink she won them round.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Jackson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs seething,\u201d Danny shrugs, \u201cI think he\u2019s in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Scott pulls a cushion over his face, \u201cHe\u2019s not good enough for her, he\u2019s a <em>lawyer</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s interested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Scott retorts darkly, glaring at Derek. \u201cStranger attractions have happened in this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got something for us,\u201d Stiles slams into the room, yanking a gold, glittering Christmas tree into the room, \u201cStole it from dermatology when they weren\u2019t looking,\u201d he announces proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an atheist,\u201d Isaac says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at it, bro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that apply to all of us?\u201d Derek eyes the stringy tree.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, uh, not if you don\u2019t want,\u201d Stiles clears his throat, looks anywhere but at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek had forgotten, for a moment, that they\u2019re not exactly on the best terms right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks great, man,\u201d Scott leaps up, clapping Stiles on the back and glaring at Derek. Derek holds up his hands in a silent apology.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I still have tinsel in my locker from last year,\u201d Danny suggests, \u201cCould make the whole room festive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, celebrate the birth of a baby with gaudy decorations,\u201d Isaac rolls his eyes, stuffing his feet back in his boots.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, don\u2019t even, I\u2019ve seen your eyes shining when we watch <em>The Grinch</em>,\u201d Stiles leaps at him, skirting Derek as he does so. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny the joy of Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, fine, it\u2019s a great holiday,\u201d Isaac cries, \u201cGet off me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn all seriousness,\u201d Stiles sits up, blows fluff out of his face, \u201cYou want me to take it away again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Isaac smiles, glances at the tree, then Derek, then back to Stiles, \u201cWe could use some cheer around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes at him, and Stiles flushes, rolls to a stand. \u201cTinsel?\u201d he directs at Danny.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Danny gestures for them to head to the locker room, and the door swings shut behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Derek says immediately, aware of Scott\u2019s eyes on him and pulling out Dominic\u2019s case notes along with three others, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake time,\u201d Scott snaps, \u201cYou\u2019re starting to look like you fit in with the furniture in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for the observation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d Scott shoves at his papers, fixes him with a look. \u201cYou should come for drinks with us later, you need a break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek considers his pile of cases, thinks about the way Stiles has stopped dragging him into his and Scott\u2019s pranks, suggesting they even eat lunch together. He misses it, he misses Stiles. He knows the chasm is of his own making, choosing his work, his own opinions, over Stiles\u2019. Every minute Derek has is dedicated to trying to get Dominic on the trial, and proving he\u2019s worth a shot. He needs to be focused, on top of things at all times. He can\u2019t lose Stiles and have it be for <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott frowns, gives Derek big, disappointed eyes, and Derek bites his tongue, trying not to blurt out he\u2019d like to change his mind about most of his life choices.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Hale!\u201d Erica skids into the room, \u201cCasey took a turn for the worse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Derek steps away from the table, pats Scott on the shoulder briefly as he grabs his coat. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Scott huffs. \u201cStubborn asshole,\u201d he adds, but there\u2019s the underlying fondness in his tone that always comes with criticism from Scott. Above all else, he\u2019s loyal to Derek, to Stiles, and Derek knows he wants them to be happy, knows he wants Derek to be happy. If he could pick anyone to be the annoying little shit of a brother he never got, but would love and irritate the hell out of at the same time, it would have been Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s brading down,\u201d Allison informs him as they fly into the ward, pushing the bed flat and moving Casey gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cO2 on a hundred per cent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, pulse is tacky, BP\u2019s one hundred over fifty\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to do a central line,\u201d Derek snaps on his gloves, nods at Erica. \u201cYou\u2019re up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Erica\u2019s face pales, \u201cDr Hale\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, you\u2019ve got this,\u201d he insists, nodding at Casey\u2019s collarbone, \u201cWhile we\u2019re young, Dr Reyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The slight sarcasm in his voice makes her jaw twitch, and she grabs a pair of gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cScalpel,\u201d she says determinedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe firm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me concentrate!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re running out of time,\u201d he says casually, stepping behind Erica.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d she says through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeart rate\u2019s coming back up,\u201d Allison points at Derek, and nods towards the door as she pushes the bed back up, \u201cA word? Good job,\u201d she adds to Erica.</p>\n<p>Erica smiles brightly as she looks down at Casey, and Derek thinks briefly of patting her shoulder, before thinking again and following Allison outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Allison folds her arms, \u201cYou\u2019ve signed up to cover the ER over Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans,\u201d Derek says shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do, I know you do, Scott\u2019s been talking dreamily about your roast potatoes for weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Derek scratches the back of his neck, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing Christmas with them this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Allison shrugs herself, \u201cI\u2019m coming over, too, this year. My dad\u2019s away on a conference in Belgium, Lydia\u2019s going to Paris.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cParis?\u201d Derek interrupts in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, she won\u2019t tell me who with,\u201d Allison rolls her eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t redirect, Derek. You don\u2019t need to be on call. I\u2019ve cycled in nurses from gyn and trauma, we have enough hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Derek insists, \u201cI\u2019ll be available.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d she sighs, \u201cBut, we won\u2019t be paging you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison\u2014\u201d Derek steps forward, \u201cDo I need to take this over your head?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to the ER,\u201d Allison steps in to meet him, \u201cI get the last call on who my nurses answer to, and of the two of us, I put more of the fear of God into Finstock than you could even dream of trying to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek clenches his jaw, folds his arms and Allison smiles sweetly at him, pats one of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might be trying to be a dick to everyone, but we knew you were already, and we still love you. Get over yourself, and get a life while you have the chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it with everyone and their motivational speeches today?\u201d he snaps, turning to stride down the corridor, \u201cI did just fine without them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe because over the last few weeks you\u2019ve been a royal pain in the ass, and we all know why?\u201d Allison calls after him.</p>\n<p>Derek flips her off, and then flushes when he turns the corner and walks into a crowd of visitors.</p>\n<p>Dammit.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDeck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la, la la la la laaa, sprinkle snow and make Doctor Hale jolly, fa la la la laaaaa\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErica,\u201d Derek fluffs at his hair, pulls out several torn up pieces of paper, \u201cYou\u2019re not concentrating.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the corner of the office, Boyd snorts into his notes, and Derek glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says easily, \u201cYou\u2019ve just got paper stuck in your glasses frame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs, pulls his glasses off and blows.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake a wish!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he says heavily, \u201cThat you would tell me what you\u2019ve learnt about Valvular Stenosis in relation to Dominic Mayetta\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDevelopment of atrial fibrillation frequently leads to an acute deterioration in patients with mitral stenosis. The rapid ventricular response results in a decrease in the diastolic filling time. We\u2019ve been using Beta blockers to control ventricular rate,\u201d Erica glances at her notes, \u201cMy diagnosis would be that he needs open mitral commissurotomy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, \u201cWe can\u2019t, Dominic\u2019s valves are calcified.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he a candidate for PMBV?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the onset of regurgitation, possibly, but we\u2019re trying to avoid invasive surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to Taubert the prosthetic valve replacement would mean he has a much higher percentage of a normal life after this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, the treatment has a higher morbidity rate than the balloon valvotomy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica shrugs, \u201cThen, why can\u2019t he have that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not the simple,\u201d Derek snaps, and then winces at the look of surprise on Erica\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe continue with therapy, then,\u201d she says after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s taking too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, the trial Dr Martin\u2019s running up in Cardio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt increases blood flow, but the risks of pulmonary venous hypertension and congestion are sky high with a kid so young.\u201d Derek rubs his face, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to push a body so fragile in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Erica murmurs.</p>\n<p>Boyd peers over her shoulder, pulls a sympathetic face, \u201cPoor kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about him like that,\u201d Derek huffs, \u201cWe\u2019re going to find a way to fix him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure we are,\u201d Erica says bracingly. Derek rolls his eyes, but huffs out a grateful laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone want coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Boyd waves his own notes in the air, \u201cI gotta get these to Dr S.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles is still here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s on the ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swallows, he\u2019d assumed the reason Stiles wasn\u2019t in their shared office was because he\u2019d gone home already. He hadn\u2019t thought Stiles was still actively avoiding him.</p>\n<p>Erica clucks her tongue, and Derek dunks the shredded paper all over her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot professional,\u201d she yells after him as he heads for the door.</p>\n<p>He slinks into the ward, glances over his sleeping patients until he sees Stiles dozing in the rocking chair in the corner. His neck\u2019s at an odd angle, and Derek rolls up a spare blanket from the stack, pushes it carefully under Stiles\u2019 head.</p>\n<p>Stiles shifts, half opening his eyes and blinking up at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth to say something, <em>anything</em>, but before he can, Stiles nods his thanks slowly, twists more comfortably and shuts his eyes again. Derek gazes down at him for a moment, tracing the familiar lines of his face, and wishes he could smooth out the frown Stiles is wearing, even as he drifts off again.</p>\n<p>He ducks to collect the toys some of their patients have been playing with before bed, chucks them in the chest he and Stiles painted a couple of years back. It\u2019s looking a little worse for wear, needs a fresh coat of paint. He tries not to think about the stupid, metaphorical implications. Tries, and fails, not to think about Stiles jabbing a paint brush into Derek\u2019s cheek, crowing when Derek glared at him, and the kids helping them had roared with laughter.</p>\n<p>It had been a good day.</p>\n<p>Olly\u2019s asleep when Derek lets himself into Dominic\u2019s room, and he moves quietly round the roll away bed, checks Dominic\u2019s stats in the dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek starts, sees Dominic\u2019s awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey champ,\u201d he says softly, \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dominic shakes his head, \u201c\u2019S\u2019too dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek twists the heart monitor away from the bed, and ups the brightness so it casts a blue glow on the room. Dominic gasps, and Derek grins at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dominic nods, \u201cCan you stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Derek sits down, grabs Dominic\u2019s hand, \u201cI\u2019ll be here the whole time you\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica wakes him at five, waves a coffee at him, \u201cYou never got the one Boyd brought back last night,\u201d she says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek rasps, cracking his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you here all night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Derek stands, stretches, \u201cYou ready to present?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do it in an hour,\u201d Erica points at his rumpled shirt, \u201cYou need to shower, Dr Hale, and I can kill time with paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek rolls his eyes, \u201cMother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my own sake,\u201d Erica pokes her nose, \u201cI have to follow you round all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares at her, but there\u2019s no heat behind it. \u201cSee if Dr Mahealani\u2019ll do presentations with you, he owes me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He peers back into the ward on their way past, and Erica shakes her head. \u201cHe went home a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Derek objects immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve been making sad eyes for days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very busy, and very tired, any eyes I\u2019ve been making have been at the very comfortable easy chair up in dermatology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose skin fuckers get all the luck,\u201d Erica bemoans.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says faintly, watching Stiles fly through the ER doors, greeting Allison at the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo shower,\u201d Erica reminds him, \u201cTry not to heart eye him too obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you don\u2019t, either,\u201d Derek snaps back.</p>\n<p>\u201cTotally different,\u201d Erica says loftily, sailing back towards the office.</p>\n<p>Derek wonders how she even survived a week with Deaton. Deaton wouldn\u2019t allow for that kind of crap, Deaton would never be such a sucker. Then again, the personal details Derek knows about Deaton are limited to his first name, and the fact he drives a Mustang Isaac talks about dreamily, he highly doubts anyone knows very much more, or gets away with asking.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have we got?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrought in unconscious, no pulse, been down five minutes,\u201d Scott reels off as he and Isaac move the body onto the bed.</p>\n<p>Derek swallows, this is all he needs, \u201cGloves,\u201d he says curtly as Allison weaves a gown over his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone page Dr Martin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2014\u201d Scott winces, \u201cThis guy was pretty much DOA, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo harm in trying then,\u201d Derek snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cMartyr,\u201d Isaac mutters, pushing the gurney from the ambulance back into the corridor.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s face twists in concern, \u201cDerek, it\u2019s ok to let this one go, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out of my trauma room,\u201d Derek snaps, and Scott huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Scott!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, but you owe me a happy best friend, man.\u00a0 He\u2019s miserable,\u201d Scott yells through the glass.</p>\n<p>Derek cricks his neck, tries not to think about how tired he is, how weary he is of this being his life. He\u2019s lived for this hospital, for these people, these strangers for so long. He doesn\u2019t know how to step away, he doesn\u2019t know how to have a life. He was lying to Stiles all those years ago, this <em>is</em> his life. It won\u2019t be for Stiles, Stiles\u2019ll find someone that has time for him, that doesn\u2019t snap unnecessarily, or lose his temper, or bury himself in his work when things get tough.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrash intubate, get the sux, Pavulon and Versed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison looks at him for a moment, and Derek refuses to budge, \u201cVersed first?\u201d she says finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo milligrams, then succinylchloline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a suction cap, too,\u201d Allison nods at Ethan. \u201cEstimated blood loss, forty percent,\u201d she adds quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Derek pushes his goggles off, \u201cDammit, I can\u2019t see a thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s crashing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrack the ribs, where the hell is my intern?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUp on the ward,\u201d Allison picks up the phone. \u201cYou want to page Lydia again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Derek holds out a hand expectantly, \u201cInternal paddles, charge to fifteen. Clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill in v-fib,\u201d Allison steps in to give compressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharge to thirty. Give him another epi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain! Clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDown to sixty two\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCharge again, a hundred of lidocane. Clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDr Hale\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wipes his brow with the back of his hand, \u201cWhen was the last epi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour minutes ago. Asistole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPush an amp of atropine and push another four milligrams of epi, <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Derek</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, keep doing the compressions, Allison, don\u2019t you dare stop. Give it a minute for the last epi to circulate, let\u2019s go, Allison, do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She takes a step back, lifts her hands from the table and the noise of the flat line is loud and clear in the room.</p>\n<p>He drops the paddles, stumbling backwards and kicking at the tray next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod <em>dammit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime of death, two forty five,\u201d Allison says softly.</p>\n<p>Without another word Derek stalks from the room, slamming back the doors. He tosses his gloves at the bin and leaves the hospital. He can\u2019t breathe, there\u2019s still sweat dripping in his eyes and outside he has to drop to his knees just to recover his breath. There\u2019s rain pouring down his neck and he rests his hands on the wet concrete as the adrenaline rushes through him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Allison rolls her eyes when she sees Derek suiting up beside her in the entrance to the ambulance bay.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says shortly, glancing up at the dark sky, snow falling thickly around them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she says lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to sign off that way in my Christmas card to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison snorts, cuts a glance at him. \u201cYou\u2019re so well suited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He frowns at her, \u201cWho is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles bursts through the doors after them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point,\u201d Allison mutters to herself.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019M\u2019not talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d Stiles jibes, \u201cShe was mean to me at lunch,\u201d he informs Derek after a beat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserved it, moping into your salsa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tries not to feel too upset they\u2019re all still having lunch without him, reminds himself this isn\u2019t high school, and that he <em>can</em> operate without a support system he has to eat lunch with every day.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Allison says firmly, looking between them, \u201cIdiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>The siren covers up any argument Stiles might have, and Scott leaps out of the back.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond and third degree burns, twenty five per cent body surface, and he\u2019s hypotensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrauma One,\u201d Derek instructs, following them in.</p>\n<p>They move around the gurney, Allison taking vitals and Derek setting up a drip. \u201cMorrell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn her way down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSet up a chest tube\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Stiles tells him from the other side of the gurney.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Derek nods, \u201cGood thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts, pushes his goggles up as blood shoots out of the tube. \u201cAnything else, Dr Hale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Morrell?\u201d Derek asks in lieu of rising to the bait.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Marin strides into the room, gloving up, \u201cUpdate me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive hundred cc\u2019s out of the right chest, eighteen per cent second degree,\u201d Stiles clangs up the sides of the gurney as Marin glances at the chart, \u201cNine per cent third degree, chest, abdomen and left leg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Marin pushes the gurney out with Ethan, \u201cCall me if you have anything <em>interesting</em> later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek quirks a grin at her and the doors swings shut, leaving them all standing in the debris of the trauma.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuper,\u201d Stiles says to no one, snapping his gloves off and tossing them in the trash. \u201cThat all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison nods, \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any more calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to return to sleeping then,\u201d Stiles glances at Derek, swallows hard, \u201cDr Hale,\u201d he says lightly, exiting after Marin.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Scott grabs his board, kisses Allison\u2019s cheek. \u201cThis is turning out to be a very bad Christmas season.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall the Grinch,\u201d Isaac drawls teasingly as he reappears, shrugging on his jacket. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll come down with a sleigh full of presents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he <em>will</em>,\u201d Scott says vehemently, elbowing his fellow EMT on the way out.</p>\n<p>Allison pings a glove at Derek, \u201cGo shower, you stink, Thanks for the help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Derek rubs his face exhaustedly.</p>\n<p>He stands in the shower, lets the water beat down against his shoulders until they feel numb.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Derek and Stiles first began working together they didn\u2019t get along very well. Derek was resentful of how easily things seemed to come to Stiles, and Stiles thought Derek was an egotistical prick\u2014something he has since informed Derek he\u2019s changed his mind about, though Derek wonders if recently Stiles\u2019 original evaluation has been reformed.</p>\n<p>It took them a while to find a rhythm working together, constantly butting heads on cases, winding each other up, hitting on weak spots\u2014Derek becoming obsessive and his lack of willingness to ask for help; Stiles\u2019 inability to take anything seriously; <em>both</em> of them getting over attached. But, eventually it began to work in their favor. Derek became something of an anchor for Stiles, kept him weighted to a situation, kept him focused, and in return Stiles brought out Derek\u2019s sense of humor, dragged him away from the hospital and his cases, whether physically on a run, or up on the roof, or sitting in their office and making Derek answer <em>Have You Ever</em> questions. They could lean on each other, Derek learnt how to trust Stiles, to ask for his opinions, for his <em>help</em>.</p>\n<p>No matter how hard Derek tried to keep Stiles at bay, tried to keep his distance, Stiles clung on, dug under his skin and made himself at home there. He got used to looking to Stiles for advice, counsel, someone to bounce ideas off, and ply him with good natured ribbing, teasing him out of his shell. Stiles\u2019 laugh, his smile, his endless enthusiasm and affection was irresistible, Derek started craving it. He\u2019s never felt less awkward, less uncomfortable in his own skin than when he\u2019s with Stiles. Stiles helped made him see he <em>was</em> good, he wasn\u2019t a lost cause, a doctor destined to quietly drink himself to death, alone in his office, he had people, he had <em>Stiles</em>.</p>\n<p>Derek throws back another shot, glares blearily at the bar clock.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019that the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Kali wipes down the bar, picks the bottle of JD up, \u201cYou\u2019re cut off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOff, done, go home,\u201d she enunciates, \u201cBefore I drag you there by those cute little ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek bashes his head against the counter top, tries not to think of the million times Stiles has tweaked said stupid, ridiculous ears and called them cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he groans, \u201c\u2019M\u2019gonna be sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctors are the worst with their liquor,\u201d Kali rolls her eyes, \u201cDerek, go home, sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he sighs, picks up his head to rest his chin on one hand, \u201cGotta go back\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Kali snorts, \u201cAs if you\u2019d even make it across the road, let alone inside. You\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d she props her elbows on the bar, eyes him carefully, \u201cMcCall and Stilinski have been coming in a lot without you recently, and you\u2019re drinking alone at one thirty on a Thursday morning\u2014you\u2019re lucky you\u2019re off in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMade sure,\u201d he slurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Kali rolls her eyes to the sky again. \u201cBut, whatever the sad little break up you boys are havin\u2019, you\u2019re gonna have to have the wake elsewhere, because I\u2019m closing up. I called your sister. That time I got shot?\u201d She waves the bottle of JD at Derek, \u201cCall it even for savin\u2019 my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCallin\u2019 m\u2019sister doesn\u2019t make us even,\u201d Derek groans. \u201cIt makes us very not even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard some loser needs a ride,\u201d Cora announces from the door, Derek falls off his chair trying to hide from her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pathetic,\u201d Cora sighs, dropping down beside him and pushing his hair off his face. \u201cCome on, if we get you to mine quick enough you might not be sick in my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019my car,\u201d Derek points out, \u201cMy beautiful car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? <em>You</em> gave it to <em>me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCos you live further away from work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cora sighs fondly, \u201cYou made that argument when you gave it to me in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t need a car anyway,\u201d Derek mumbles, \u201cDon\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, this pity party is officially over,\u201d Cora hauls him up, \u201cThis is such a weird role reversal I\u2019m getting whiplash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d Kali winks at them both, \u201cGet home safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora drops Derek into the passenger seat with a grunt, \u201cGod, you weigh a ton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou callin\u2019 me fat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d she slams the door. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>actually</em> looking a little skinny, bro,\u201d she eyes him as she clambers into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYou eating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse,\u201d Derek stares out of the window and then twists to look at her, \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a date tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cora smirks, \u201cAs if I\u2019m putting out on the first date, she\u2019s gotta work for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAtta girl,\u201d Derek pats her thigh, \u201cBe safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really apply to me,\u201d Cora grins, \u201cBut I appreciate the sentiment.\u201d</p>\n<p>She must be feeling sorry for Derek because she barely complains when he throws up all over the upholstery of the Camaro. She even makes him pancakes in the morning and tells him to have a terrible day at work, which, in Cora terms means <em>I forgive you, and probably love you</em>. Derek hopes.</p>\n<p>He sends her flowers with a note that says <em>tell anyone about last night, and I\u2019ll keep sending flowers</em>.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t tell anyone. She does text him telling him to sort his priorities out, and Derek pulls a face at the screen. His priorities are fine. He\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p>So not fine.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI need a <em>drink</em>,\u201d Danny sweeps into the break room, and Derek looks up wanly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? God, don\u2019t talk to me about alcohol,\u201d he scrubs at his face, \u201cI\u2019m still recovering from yesterday. I had to have a banana bag all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny sniggers, \u201cYou did look a little worse for wear. You okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek sighs, flashes him an attempt at a grin, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d Danny says easily, \u201cI\u2019m not the one sleeping in my office, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glowers at him, scrubs at his face, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEleven thirty,\u201d Danny kicks off his shoes, lifts Allison\u2019s feet off the couch and pops them back in his lap without waking her. \u201cYou on all night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d Danny gives him a sarcastic thumbs up as he pulls out his iPod. \u201cWhere\u2019s Stilinski?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Derek says hoarsely, \u201cSleeping?\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny shakes his head, \u201cNope, \u2018s\u2019not like you two to not be attached at the hip, it\u2019s starting to give me hives seeing one without the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a sour glare, and Danny rolls it off his back like a duck with water, \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty together to break up,\u201d he points at Derek, \u201cDon\u2019t let him get away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t here in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure he was,\u201d Danny says easily, \u201cHe always was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls at the empty coffee filter because it\u2019s hard to scowl at Danny in the face of his bright optimism for too long. He wishes he could talk to Stiles, but there\u2019s something stubbornly holding him back, something making the distance between them worse.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible that because of it, Derek is being nine thousand times more of an asshole than usual, if even Cora\u2019s called him out on it and she normally thrives on it.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t left the hospital in nearly ten days, aside from his decision to try and drink their local bar dry. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s starting to look like a mountain man.</p>\n<p>He <em>misses</em> Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d Lydia pops her head round the door, scrunches up her face at the smell of the room. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny\u2019s feet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa,\u201d Danny flicks a paper ball at Derek\u2019s head, \u201cJust because we\u2019re not all blessed with a private Cardio lounge, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can come visit any time you like,\u201d she says sweetly, <em>dimpling</em> at Danny, and Danny freaking <em>dimples</em> back.</p>\n<p>Derek clears his throat, \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she jerks her head out into the corridor, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe trial finishes on the thirty-first, and Dominic\u2019s not made the break through we\u2019d like,\u201d Lydia launches straight to the point as the door swings shut, Derek pulls himself upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, the results of the trial, destroyed as they have been by your last minute case, will go through on the first, and Dominic will have to be dropped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia,\u201d Derek says aghast, \u201cThis is his last shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she bites her lip, the sincerity in her gaze unusual from the hard hitting, unapologetic surgeon he knows and respects.</p>\n<p>He nods slowly, trying to keep from punching the wall beside them. He feels suddenly, <em>horrendously</em> helpless.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for letting me know,\u201d he intones eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says immediately, \u201cYou were amazing, thanks for even\u2026 trying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny time,\u201d Lydia says softly, giving him a sad smile.</p>\n<p>When Derek goes back into the break room, it feels like the Christmas lights are mocking him. The only reason he doesn\u2019t take them down is because he knows Scott would decapitate him, and nobody deserves to go down with Derek.</p>\n<p>He grabs his coat, pulls the threadbare blanket over a passed out Danny, and heads for the elevators. He feels like a zombie, barely noticing people flitting in and out around him. There\u2019s only the distant sounds of late night traffic, and the snow falling around him as he heads out onto the roof, stares bleakly across the town. Nobody\u2019s laughing beside him, jostling his arm, or making him eat something. No one\u2019s keeping his hands warm this time. He exhales sharply, watches his breath curl in the air. He\u2019s so <em>lost</em>. His eyes catch on the faint lights of Stiles\u2019 apartment block, and he swallows around a lump in his throat. He knows where he needs to be, where he probably always should have been.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles takes less than a minute to answer the door. He blinks in the light of the hallway and squints at him in surprise, \u201cDerek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek practically falls into him and Stiles trips, leading them both to the couch. \u201cDerek, you\u2014what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d Derek sighs, clutching tightly at Stiles\u2019 soft t-shirt. \u201cYou were fucking right.\u201d And then he\u2019s wracking in a huge breath and burying his face in Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cI fucked up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 hands tighten where they\u2019re wrapped around his shoulders. \u201cNot even possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, Stiles, I\u2019m\u2014I can\u2019t do it anymore. And Dominic\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not worked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans softly, drops his head back so that Derek falls against him, head still on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>Derek</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have fucking listened to you. I\u2019m sorry; I should never have pushed with the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles moves a hand to scratch it through Derek\u2019s hair. Derek pushes into the comforting warmth of it, wants to stay tangled on Stiles\u2019 shitty, old couch forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to do the right thing,\u201d Stiles murmurs. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>forever</em> trying to do the right thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even work. It was all for nothing\u2014everything I said to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForget about it,\u201d Stiles says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek chokes, \u201cI was a dick. And that kid\u2019s gonna die, and I couldn\u2019t fix it. You were right, I just couldn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t want to give up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles sighs, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t know where else to go,\u201d he admits finally.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Here</em>, you come here, always,\u201d Stiles insists, \u201cEven when you\u2019ve been a total douche, this is still your place to come to.\u201d</p>\n<p>To come <em>home</em> <em>to</em> lingers wordlessly in the air, and Derek sighs, clings to the promise.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later he says incredulously. \u201cAre you wearing Star Wars pyjamas?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts and nods, his chin digging into the top of Derek\u2019s head, \u201cThey were a present, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Derek clears his throat, sits up with his hand still pressed to Stiles\u2019 chest. \u201cThey\u2019re very fetching.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes, and Derek couldn\u2019t be more thankful for him, for how easily he\u2019s let Derek in, looked after him, again. Every time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Stiles shrugs, \u201cI seem to remember havin\u2019 a couple of meltdowns on you in our time together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a meltdown.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, buddy, you look like you haven\u2019t showered, or eaten in weeks, and it\u2019s two thirty in the morning,\u201d Stiles points at him, \u201cMeltdown.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flops back against the couch cushions, glares without heat, and Stiles grins, pushes Derek\u2019s hair out of his face. He slides his hand to readjust Derek\u2019s glasses, eyes warm and caring as he looks at Derek. Derek can do little more than blink dumbly, gratefully, adoringly no doubt, up at him.</p>\n<p>Stiles trails his fingers across Derek\u2019s brow, snorts, \u201cYou\u2019re losin\u2019 your laughter lines to this frown.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019been a bad couple of weeks,\u201d Derek huffs, \u201cI haven\u2019t been laughing much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCos you\u2019ve not been with me and Scott,\u201d Stiles points out, correctly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you,\u201d Derek says faintly.</p>\n<p>Stiles bites his lip, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d He clears his throat, and stands up, looks around, at anything but Derek. \u201cUh, you want somethin\u2019 to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek sighs out, melting into the warmth of Stiles\u2019 vacated couch space as he disappears into the kitchen, banging the microwave open loudly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott pads into the living room, spots Derek and comes over, \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens one eye, nods his head, \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek rolls over onto his back, licks his lips as he glances at Scott. \u201c\u2019M\u2019sorry if I was an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott eyes him for a second, and then cracks a grin, \u201cNothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek reaches out to shove at his shoulder, trying not to smile, and Scott bowls on top of him, crowing as he thuds Derek over the head with a pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d he says after a minute, dark eyes going serious, \u201cIt blew for all of us, man. We have so much Christmas to catch up on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek feels his smile widen, \u201cI can deal with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m gone for two minutes and you two start groping each other,\u201d Stiles arches an eyebrow, \u201cHow will Allison take this betrayal, Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolls off Derek, shaking his head fondly, \u201cHa <em>ha</em>.\u201d He heads for the kitchen, starts making breakfast, and Derek figures he must be starting at five to be up this early. They\u2019re none of them morning people by choice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stayin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks across at Stiles in the dimly lit living room, the soft light of the side lamp making his eyes glow warm as he looks back at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat, and Derek wonders, for the thousandth time, what\u2019s going through Stiles\u2019 head as he considers Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can always stay,\u201d he says finally, clapping his hands together, \u201cI\u2019ll go get you somethin\u2019 a little more comfy to sleep in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gazes at the wall Stiles and Scott have filled with pictures of their time as friends, smiles at the shots of himself, of Allison and Lydia and Danny and Isaac that have filtered in; Stiles with his arm looped round Scott\u2019s head and half jumping on him; Derek looking unimpressed in reindeer ears next to a raucously laughing Stiles; Lydia sitting on a rock at the beach, beaming in the sunshine, oblivious to Danny behind her holding seaweed.</p>\n<p>He spins round when Stiles comes back through to the living room, strips off his shirt to take the one Stiles is holding out stretched.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles says with a crack in his voice. \u201cSure, don\u2019t\u2014okay\u2014I\u2019m gonna go use the bathroom.\u201d He trips over the coffee table, and Derek lunges out to catch his arm. \u201cNow you\u2019re just cheating,\u201d Stiles sighs, looking up at him as he leans into Derek\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cFast reactions,\u201d Derek shrugs, \u201cI spend time with <em>you</em>, go figure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant,\u201d Stiles\u2019 tongue pokes out to wet his lips, and Derek tracks the movement, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles straightens, awkwardly pats Derek\u2019s arm, and as his fingers brush Derek\u2019s skin he can feel himself shiver.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he manages.</p>\n<p>\u201cYell if you need something,\u201d Stiles heads for the bathroom, \u201cYou on tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot till noon,\u201d Derek drags his eyes from watching Stiles walk away, \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo, I\u2019ll come in with you, though,\u201d Stiles glances over his shoulder, smiles softly. \u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Derek says, bending to pull his shoes off.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a strangled noise and slams the bathroom door.</p>\n<p>Derek flops back onto the couch, and stares at the ceiling. When the pictures start mocking him for being a loser, he throws an arm over his face, tries to block out how aware he is of Stiles sleeping just feet away from him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always wanted. It took all of four months for it to grow into more. He\u2019s kept it at bay because they work well as a team, amazingly, against all odds, and Derek\u2019s never had such a good thing going in his life before. He\u2019s never had someone like Stiles to chivvy him along, to wind him up, or care for him when he himself can\u2019t even figure out what he needs. Stiles always knows. He can\u2019t bear making things uncomfortable or putting Stiles in awkward position. He doesn\u2019t want to ever be a dick to Stiles, is incredulous Stiles puts up with him on a good day, let alone forgives him for a bad <em>month</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cBye losers,\u201d Scott yells, \u201cI know you\u2019re both awake because I can feel the awkwardness lingering in the air.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slams the door, and Derek pulls a cushion over his head as Stiles squawks in indignation from his bedroom.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek wakes to the sound of tapping on a keyboard. He rolls over, takes in Stiles sitting in his comfy chair, swathed in a hoodie two sizes too large, and typing fiercely. There\u2019s coffee beside Derek and he hunches up to reach it, slides back into the warmth of the cushions to watch Stiles work. Occasionally, he chews at a pencil, puts his own glasses on to read something more closely, and Derek can\u2019t get enough of this, of the feeling of <em>home</em> and domesticity. \u00a0He feels better than he has in weeks, he doesn\u2019t know why he tried to pretend he doesn\u2019t need this. Need Stiles, maybe. Probably. Most definitely.</p>\n<p>Stiles starts when Derek clears his throat, glowers at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was my coffee, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins over the rim, lifts the mug, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even like it black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing,\u201d Derek smiles wider, \u201c\u2019S\u2019delicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, if you\u2019re too busy drinking my coffee then maybe you won\u2019t wanna hear the awesome news I have for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek arches an eyebrow, passes Stiles his coffee wordlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, damn right,\u201d Stiles takes a sip, makes a satisfied noise. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, news?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Stiles unfolds his legs, shuffles to face Derek, \u201cSo, I emailed Chetan Mehta before I went to bed last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital? In <em>England?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, and he\u2019s gonna consult on Dominic\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek feels his eyes go wide, and if he\u2019d been holding the coffee he would have dropped it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad you gave my mug back now?\u201d Stiles asks with a shit eating grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d Derek runs a hand over his jaw, laughs stupidly, \u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStatements you have never made before,\u201d Stiles crows, and Derek laughs again, tries to glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t even think of getting in touch with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it, I mean,\u201d Stiles scratches the back of his neck, \u201cI just\u2026 wanted to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Derek looks at his hands, \u201cStiles, this is\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome? Amazing? Fantastic? Splendid?\u201d Stiles wiggles his eyebrows at Derek and Derek shakes his head, gazes at him fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of the above.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to type that out and hang it above my bed,\u201d Stiles leans back in his chair, waves a hand across the air, \u201cThe day Derek Hale called me splendid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, \u201cI\u2019ll get you a plaque for Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want for Christmas,\u201d Stiles says dismissively.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? What d\u2019you want then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 pupils blow wide for a second, and he throws his legs on the table, crossing them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think of something,\u201d he says, staring at Derek intensely, \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares back at him, swallows hard and it\u2019s almost like the temperature in the room goes up about a thousand degrees. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but nothing Star Wars related,\u201d Stiles says in a brighter tone, \u201cScott\u2019s got that one covered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs, lies back on the couch and tries to quench the butterflies in his stomach. He didn\u2019t even know they were a real thing.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHold these,\u201d Allison hands Derek the end of a paper chain, and Derek continues signing charts absently, taking the chain. \u201cAnd these,\u201d she shoves tinsel under his arm, and he clamps down on it as best he can. \u201cAnd this,\u201d she balances something on the top of his head. \u201cPerfect. Now!\u201d She calls, and Stiles leaps out of the break room, snaps his camera as Derek looks around in bewilderment. Stiles clutches his sides laughing as Derek peers down at himself, wrapped in tinsel and a star falls off his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d he says drily, shaking off the tinsel, \u201cDoes this have somewhere it needs to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re gonna go decorate the ward,\u201d Stiles picks it up, winds it round Derek\u2019s neck again, \u201cBut, it just looks so good on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes him seem\u2026 friendly,\u201d Isaac comments, tipping his head to one side as he considers Derek from the ER desk.</p>\n<p>Derek bares his teeth at him, and Stiles starts humming O\u2019 Christmas Tree under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo ho ho,\u201d Scott announces his presence, and Allison squeals\u2014a noise Derek has never heard her make before\u2014right in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Stiles cries, bounding towards Scott, who is dressed as Santa. \u201cYou look awesome. Quick, go stand next to Derek, you guys can be\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Finstock strides through the ER doors after Scott, batting snow off himself like it\u2019s personally offended him. \u201cMcCall, you look fantastic, Hale, you look ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChief,\u201d Allison\u2019s immediately in professional mode, reaching over her desk to grab charts, \u201cEverything\u2019s up to speed, two patients in curtains, the interns are dealing with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Finstock glances at the top chart and balks. \u201cWhose writing is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison glances over his shoulder, \u201cDr Reyes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, it\u2019s worse than Hales\u2019, she\u2019s been picking up bad habits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns, \u201cChief, Derek\u2019s handwriting\u2019s like a pretty picture, have you seen his loops?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I have, they\u2019ve offended me for years,\u201d Finstock juts his head at Derek, \u201cYou never got the memo about short hand either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo ironic considering his speech vocabulary,\u201d Isaac mutters, and Derek leans over the desk to cuff him round the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCase in point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Finstock wrinkles up his nose, \u201cYou\u2019re all so full of cheer, when did this happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Derek stopped being a martyr and showered,\u201d Scott says brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Finstock chides, \u201cHe\u2019s a good doctor, even if his handwriting\u2019s an abomination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Behind him, Stiles stuffs his fingers in his mouth to stop laughing, and Derek can feel his whole face flaming up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, when\u2019s this blasted party I\u2019m supposed to be attending and pretending to enjoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you will, Chief,\u201d Danny says easily from the step ladder he\u2019s leaning on to hang lights. \u201cThere\u2019ll be eggnog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fantastic</em>, Hale, Stilinski,\u201d Finstock starts walking, \u201cWith me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shoots Derek a quizzical look, and Derek shrugs, just as confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are getting your extra funding this year, think you impressed the board with how many hours you were putting in down here,\u201d Finstock begins as they jog to keep up with him. \u201cSo, both your interns have put in requests to stay on paeds, they\u2019re willing to float to the ER, too, though god knows how you convinced them to do that. You want to keep \u2018em on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, both of them want to stay?\u201d Derek asks in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, <em>listen</em>, Hale,\u201d Finstock remonstrates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to keep Boyd on,\u201d Stiles nods, \u201cHe\u2019s on top of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh, he make a good surgeon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was he with before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s good then,\u201d Finstock nods, glances at Derek, \u201cAnd yours was with Deaton mmm, she any good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s great,\u201d Derek says honestly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stellar</em> input.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, \u201cYes, if she wants to come back, she can. She needs some time with Stiles, though; needs to see his bedside manner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYours is better than mine,\u201d Stiles protests, \u201cHave you seen yourself with kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s heart-warming and adorable,\u201d Finstock snaps, \u201cFigure out the details between you, I don\u2019t care, you\u2019re both doing excellent work. Get back to it,\u201d he dismisses them with a wave of his hand, continuing to stalk along the corridor. \u201cEthan! I like these decorations very much!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan leans out of the nurse\u2019s office, waves a hand after Finstock, \u201cUh, thanks Chief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might be my favorite person on the planet,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo chance, you have Scott,\u201d Derek teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Stiles turns back to the nurse\u2019s station, grins at their friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond favorite then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThird,\u201d Stiles twirls on his toes, points at Derek, \u201cYou\u2019re prettier than Finstock, you totally rank higher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHigh praise indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes, is suddenly in Derek\u2019s space, clutching his shirt tightly, \u201cYou\u2019re in a whole other league, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s letting go, disappearing into one of the curtained areas to check on Boyd and the patient, and Derek\u2019s left gazing after him, startled and a little awed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Allison calls, snapping him out of it. \u201cStab wound, ETA three minutes, can you take this? Lewis is out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he darts towards Erica\u2019s curtain, pulls it back and juts his chin, \u201cYou finished?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Erica considers her neat patch of gauze looking pleased. \u201cIsn\u2019t it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a trauma patient coming in, I need you on this with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She breathes out in surprise.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs, \u201cDon\u2019t have a coronary over it, I need another pair of hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, gee, when you put it like that,\u201d she snaps off her gloves, turns to smile sweetly at her patient, who grins back at her dazedly. Derek rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep it clean, and keep it dry, no funny business, Mr Alton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely, Dr Reyes,\u201d Mr Alton nods vehemently. Through the other side of the curtain Derek hears Stiles burst into laughter, and apologize to his own patient. He aims for the shadow, punches the curtain gently, and grins when Stiles jumps in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Erica follows him towards the ER entrance, \u201cYou two. How have you not climbed him like the tree he so obviously wants to be for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Derek snipes.</p>\n<p>Erica smirks, \u201cIt\u2019s <em>totally</em> my business, I\u2019m your intern for the whole year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d Derek gives her a toothy smile, \u201cI have charts backed up from last winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t learning so much from you I would <em>so</em> go up to Ortho,\u201d she mutters, \u201cThey break bones for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you <em>are</em> learning,\u201d Derek says smugly, and then feels his chest compress a little with pride when Erica nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou requested to stay on with me,\u201d Derek pushes the doors open, \u201cMeans you like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike <em>learning</em> from you,\u201d Erica corrects, \u201cBesides, if I stay with you, I can look at Stiles all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dr Stilinski</em>,\u201d Derek corrects.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you call him that in the bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek trips over nothing. Erica grins to herself. The ambulance pulls in and Aiden jumps out of the rig, pulls the gurney with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo guys got into a fight over a <em>Christmas tree</em>, multiple stab wounds to the back, pulse is sluggish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Derek leads them into Trauma Two. \u201cAlright, on my count,\u201d Derek slides his fingers under the back board, \u201cTwo, three, slide him across, spin a crit right away. Push etimodate and sux now. Number eight ET tube,\u201d he nods at Erica, \u201cDo the honors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChest tube tray?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, start a central line.\u201d He glances at Allison, \u201cBlood pressure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNinety over fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour units of O-Neg, hang two on the rapid infuser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica nods, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetadine and a sterile drape. Roll him, let me look again,\u201d Derek clucks his tongue. \u201cMissed the spine, should be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPressure\u2019s up to ninety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBook an OR. Hook up the Thora-Seal,\u201d Derek snaps off his gloves, \u201cGet X-ray down here for a chest, just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison picks up the phone as Finstock strides back into the room, \u201cWhat a day. With any luck I\u2019ll be in the OR and miss the blasted Christmas party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Allison says firmly, gowning him up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has come to this,\u201d Finstock declares mournfully, \u201cMy life dictated by people who want me to be <em>pleasant</em>.\u201d Allison beams dangerously at him, steps back to let him work.</p>\n<p>Derek lifts his eyebrows at the door and gestures for Erica to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping up in traumas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, I think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a compliment,\u201d he says shortly, and Erica\u2019s face lights up.</p>\n<p>She clears her throat, nods jerkily, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I will,\u201d she promises in a steely voice, \u201cA lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I chose to keep you on,\u201d Derek grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m good, and I\u2019m loyal and I\u2019d probably kill for you,\u201d Erica examines her nails.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Probably</em>,\u201d Derek shakes his head, \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just letting you know,\u201d she says sweetly, \u201cI intend for you to be my mentor right up until I myself become an attending. You\u2019re very much stuck with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek considers her, gaze firm and assured, cool and collected in the face of mass traumas, picking things up easily, ribbing Derek in a way he doesn\u2019t let many people get away with.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d he says eventually, \u201cI could do much worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica arches an eyebrow, \u201cDid we just have a moment, at Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Christmas for another four days,\u201d Derek snaps, \u201cGo do charts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d she says primly, flouncing off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love her a little bit,\u201d Allison says from beside him, pulling off her gown. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for her to meet Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shudders at the very thought.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek is not one for parties, or soirees, or being particularly sociable. He has a handful of people he likes to interact with, barely, and three, tops, he\u2019ll actively seek out to spend time with. This Christmas party does not count as something he\u2019d like to attend of his own free will.</p>\n<p>However, when Allison hands him a hot mug of something and knocks it against her own, smiling fondly, he can\u2019t deny he\u2019s perhaps glad he\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s sitting in the corner of the break room, possibly asleep, having been round all the wards this afternoon, handing out presents they all donated. It was his day off; Scott is literally the embodiment of the season he loves so much. \u00a0Derek takes him a beer over and allows Scott to lean against his shoulder when he dozes off again.</p>\n<p>He would try and claim he\u2019s not waiting for Stiles to show up before he relaxes, but he\u2019s pretty sure every person in the room would know he\u2019s lying.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got pizza!\u201d Stiles bursts into the room wearing a lurid red jumper with a fluorescent green Christmas tree on, and winks at Derek as he passes, \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous now, I got you one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing anything remotely similar to that, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his head back in a fake laugh, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a jester here,\u201d he tosses the bag at Derek, \u201cIt\u2019s in your size. Wear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek unfolds the sweater, gazes down at the mass of baubles on the front in different shades of pink and purple.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Stiles juts out his bottom lip, \u201cYou were pretty mean to me for a while back there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes, mouth falling open, \u201cYou can\u2019t use that against me with <em>this</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure I can,\u201d Stiles hands pizza out on plates, beaming at the rest of the staff as he talks to Derek, \u201cI can use it for at least a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek sighs, stands and shrugs off his jacket.</p>\n<p>From across the room Lydia wolf whistles, and Danny yells, \u201cBam Chicka <em>Wow Wow</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, the people I\u2019ve hired are awful,\u201d Finstock groans, planting himself in Derek\u2019s spot on the couch and looking horrified when Scott curls into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Stiles declares as Derek pulls the sweater over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surer than ever that you use this season to humiliate me in the worst ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Stiles chirps as he takes a picture, \u201cMy dad\u2019ll love that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe coming up for Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, he and Melissa are doin\u2019 something quiet, seeing as Scott and I are both working between Christmas and New Year,\u201d Stiles shrugs looking a little wistful, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go home on the thirty first, though.\u201d His face lights up, \u201cHey, you should come with. My dad hasn\u2019t seen you in forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Derek says softly, \u201cSaid I\u2019d cover for Danny, seeing as he\u2019s got plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both glance over to where Danny and Lydia are laughing at something, and Stiles pretends to crack his knuckles menacingly. \u201cYou want me to take him out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek laughs, \u201cThen you\u2019d have to work, too, dumbass.\u201d He turns to look fondly at Stiles, \u201cBut, thanks for the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Stiles shifts on the table they\u2019re leaning against, smiles at Derek, and just like that the room fades out, Derek\u2019s having trouble breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, oops,\u201d Allison appears, dangling mistletoe between them, \u201cI slipped,\u201d she says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBabe, no cheating,\u201d Scott calls from where he\u2019s half asleep on Finstock\u2019s shoulder still.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d she huffs, \u201cYou two owe me like fifty bucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to pay up,\u201d Stiles says drily. He stretches, glances back at Derek, \u201cYou\u2019re on call, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek sighs, \u201cCome on, we better catch some shut eye before this lot start singing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCarolling,\u201d Danny points at them both, \u201cTomorrow afternoon, <em>everyone</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Isaac clutches his throat, \u201cI\u2019m an atheist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you pretending to have a bad throat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause last year you made me sing anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to again this year,\u201d Danny gives him a devilish grin, and Isaac bashes his head against the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can, I\u2019m just not going to,\u201d Stiles says breezily, \u201cNobody wants to hear me sing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did a pretty good rendition of <em>Last Christmas</em> the other day in the shower,\u201d Scott pipes up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Stiles groans, face going bright red, \u201cTotally on the list of things I want the whole world to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re down for it, Stilinski,\u201d Danny warns, \u201cDo your rounds early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I have to, Derek has to,\u201d Stiles yells as they head out of the break room, Derek jabs him in the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think your singing\u2019s bad? You don\u2019t want to hear <em>me</em> sing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI listen to you sing all the time,\u201d Stiles rolls his eyes, \u201cYou always forget I\u2019m in the room when you\u2019re doing charts and listening to <em>Queen</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stills in the corridor, mortified. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019cute,\u201d Stiles scratches his nose, \u201cMade me very fond of a few of their songs. Can\u2019t hear <em>Love Of My Life</em> without thinking of you caterwauling it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The elevator opens, and Stiles steps inside, smiles brightly at him. \u201cComing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s feet move automatically, still in horrified silence, and Stiles starts laughing as the doors close.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop worrying, honestly, it\u2019s adorable. I don\u2019t think any less of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think <em>that</em>,\u201d Derek insists, \u201cI just\u2014why didn\u2019t you tell me to shut up, or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s like,\u201d Stiles shrugs, suddenly looks as awkward as Derek, \u201cFeels like somethin\u2019 you\u2019d do at home, or when you\u2019re comfortable. I like that you do that with me, even if you don\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>am</em> comfortable with you,\u201d Derek says incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says softly, stares at the elevator numbers.</p>\n<p>Derek looks at him, drinks in his sharp, beautiful profile, the hands that fix children and <em>Derek</em>, the shoulders that hold up so much without even realizing it, keep them all pieced together, sweeps his gaze down to his ribs where his heart beats, his feet tapping with the restless energy that always makes him seem like <em>more</em>, like a wonderful, smart, kind, sarcastic, exaggerated version of all the things Derek loves. He lets it flood over him, how much he loves Stiles, and how far they\u2019ve come, how much more he wants, how even when Derek\u2019s stupidly oblivious, or rude, even in his worst moments, or his most <em>embarrassing</em>, Stiles has never run from it. He was there, constant, steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He clears his throat as Stiles turns his head to look at him. Derek takes off his glasses, messes with them for a moment before slipping them back on, and swallowing. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles gives him a small smile, the elevator slows.</p>\n<p>Derek scrunches his eyes shut, takes a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>The doors open, and Stiles grabs his hand before Derek can move, holds it so tightly Derek thinks he hears bones crunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love <em>you</em>,\u201d Stiles breathes out, still staring straight ahead, and Derek feels his stomach lurch with <em>joy</em> at the very idea.</p>\n<p>Derek squeezes his hand, the doors close, Stiles turns to look at him again, mouth curled up in a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you <em>a lot</em>, like, since before we were even friends, I think. I wanted to be around you, like, shit I think I probably drove you crazy, but I couldn\u2019t stop. And I never get tired of it; I <em>never</em> get tired of you. I wanna be with you <em>all the time</em>, I look for you in rooms I know you\u2019re not gonna be in just in case, like, shit, Derek, you have no idea\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tugs him into his space with their clasped hands, cups his jaw and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a noise, low in the back of his throat and lets go of Derek\u2019s hand to wrap his arms round Derek\u2019s neck, curls his fingers in his hair. Derek leans into him, their bodies pressed tight together as Stiles parts his lips and Derek licks into his mouth, heat coiling in his abdomen at the way Stiles feels everywhere they\u2019re touching.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already addicted to the way Stiles tastes, seeking it out under the sugary candy cane Stiles must have been sucking on earlier, pushing his tongue against Stiles\u2019 until it\u2019s just <em>Stiles</em>, to where it\u2019s warm, and sweet and exactly what he wants all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles murmurs, pulling away for a second, but letting Derek chase his lips, capturing them again. \u201cMmmf, Derek, <em>god</em>, we should\u2014talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Derek promises, bumping his nose against Stiles\u2019 cheek, breathing him in. He darts out his tongue and then kisses one of the moles on the side of Stiles\u2019 face. It makes Stiles laugh. Derek\u2019s insides burst delightedly at the sound. Stiles falls against the side of the elevator and tugs Derek with him, grinding into him with renewed fervour as they kiss again.</p>\n<p>Derek groans, rubs his cheek against Stiles\u2019, \u201cWe have to get out of the elevator,\u201d he mutters, nipping at Stiles\u2019 jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles\u2019 agreement turns into a moan as Derek slides his hands down his sides and under the stupid, ugly sweater, stroking smooth, hot skin. \u201cShit, your <em>hands</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek splays his hands out against Stiles\u2019 ribs, digs his fingers in and pulls him in to kiss him again. He shoves his thigh between Stiles\u2019 legs, grinds it up and Stiles breaks away, breathing fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, <em>Derek</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWanted you for <em>so</em> long,\u201d Derek murmurs, \u201cI have no idea? <em>You</em> have no idea,\u201d he ducks to kiss Stiles\u2019 neck, sucking a bruise into the pale skin just above his shirt collar, relishing the idea it\u2019ll last, that this is <em>real</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>hate</em> you for not doing anything sooner,\u201d Stiles huffs, fingers pushing up the back of Derek\u2019s shirt and belying his words with how gentle they are, flexing against his skin. \u201cYou should have done something years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t\u2014think you\u2019d want this,\u201d Derek kisses his neck apologetically, rests his forehead against the side of Stiles\u2019 face for a second and they both still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. The whole time,\u201d he tells the top of Derek\u2019s head, his hands drawing slow, lazy circles down his back. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> an idiot,\u201d Derek retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re infuriating,\u201d Stiles sighs, hauling Derek up by his collar and kissing him fiercely.</p>\n<p>The elevator doors open, and they break apart to see Allison and Scott laughing together. They stop smiling when they see Stiles and Derek. Scott\u2019s mouth falls open. They all look at each other in silence. Derek huffs a breath against Stiles\u2019 mouth and feels Stiles\u2019 lips twitch into a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles says after a moment, clearing his throat. \u201cGoing up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys all lose,\u201d Scott yells back towards the break room. \u201cI win! I called it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShush, patients,\u201d Allison elbows him, \u201c<em>Someone</em> ought to be remembering they exist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Derek straightens up, loath to put too much distance between himself and Stiles, and Stiles catches his hand again. It makes him feel stupidly happy. \u201cWe knew where we were the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird on so many levels,\u201d Stiles dismisses, \u201cWe didn\u2019t. Derek was totally gone on my sweet moves. He couldn\u2019t have told you his own name three seconds ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crunches his fingers together.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh ha haaa, uh, I mean,\u201d Stiles winces, \u201cLook, are you guys going up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Scott strolls into the elevator beaming, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go look at the stars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so clich\u00e9,\u201d Stiles groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were making out in an elevator,\u201d Allison points out, \u201cNeither of you can talk, ever again. Even if Scott and I get married in Vegas, or get matching tattoos, or\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cName our children after characters in books?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Allison dimples at him, \u201cPerfect example.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is awful,\u201d Stiles mumbles to Derek as Scott and Allison smile at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking out in an elevator,\u201d Scott and Allison say together.</p>\n<p>The elevator comes to a stop on the third floor, and this time Derek pulls Stiles out, \u201cGood night,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cSorry,\u201d he adds to Allison.</p>\n<p>She laughs, \u201cI\u2019m only surprised it took you two this long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy you breakfast with my winnings,\u201d Scott tells her as the doors start to close.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek sticks his free hand out, stops the doors, \u201cHow did you\u2014what was your?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Scott nods understandingly, \u201cOriginally, I was going to bet a week. Then I figured if Stiles was gonna go for anyone, it\u2019d be someone as awkward and anxious and awesome as he is, but that also pretends not to be. I figured it\u2019d take a while. And, it\u2019s you two, so I had the elevators because,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cI\u2019m also awesome, and I know you two like to bond in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a hospital television show clich\u00e9,\u201d Derek insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott says blithely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Stiles repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott winks as the doors close again, and Stiles turns to glower at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have said it anywhere else? Now everyone\u2019s going to mock the shit out of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek thinks for a moment, grins at Stiles, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 face softens, and he leans into Derek, throws his arms around his waist. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be romantic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019M\u2019not at all, that was just the truth,\u201d Derek argues, his own hands catching Stiles\u2019 hips and squeezing them gently through the fabric of his pants.</p>\n<p>Stiles shivers, \u201cY\u2019are, you\u2019re gonna blow my mind with it, I can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Derek murmurs, pressing his lips to Stiles\u2019 again.</p>\n<p>Someone slams charts down behind them, and they both spin to see a nurse pointing at the sign that says <em>No Visitors After Nine</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d Stiles winces, \u201cNone of our lies make us look very good, do they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek wraps his hand round his, \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he says to the nurse, and drags Stiles towards the on call room.</p>\n<p>\u201cFYI, we\u2019re not having sex in here,\u201d Stiles tells him as they fall against the door, teeth clacking because they\u2019re too busy grinning to kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d Derek arches an eyebrow, \u201cDo you need candles and romantic music?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, ass,\u201d Stiles shoves at his shoulder, \u201cBecause I can\u2019t ride you on one of those stupid, tiny bunk beds.\u201d He palms the front of Derek\u2019s pants, bites his lip, \u201cAnd I really wanna do that. I really, really, really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Derek says hoarsely, catching his hand, but not moving it, \u201cI see your point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, we have a shift. You need to call Mehta, sort out approvals for Visas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really love you,\u201d Derek breathes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says brightly, flexes his fingers against the outline of Derek\u2019s cock, \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew what you were getting into,\u201d Stiles steps around him, tugs off his sweater, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about us not having a really quick, dirty jerk off session, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAppealing,\u201d Derek says drily, but eyes are drawn to Stiles\u2019 chest, the sharp cut of his hips, and the trail of hair into his pants. He really, <em>really</em> wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re hot,\u201d he blurts out before he can stop himself, tugging off his own sweater and hoping it lands in the trash by accident.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles lifts his eyebrows, throws himself on the bed and beckons Derek over, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFiguratively, or literally,\u201d Derek drawls, eyes on Stiles\u2019 stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles grins as Derek climbs on top of him, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it so easy,\u201d Derek hisses as he presses Stiles into the mattress and his dick rubs against Stiles\u2019 through layers of thin fabric.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly for you,\u201d Stiles teases, before his eyes flutter shut as Derek ducks to bite his collarbone. \u201cOh, okay, yeah, totally easy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek feels himself smile, bites his lip as he runs a hand down the centre of Stiles\u2019 chest, slides it to the side and rests it over his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he admits.</p>\n<p>Stiles trails his fingers up Derek\u2019s arms, tugs on his shoulders. When Derek\u2019s at eye level he pulls off his glasses for him, stretches to place them on the cabinet.</p>\n<p>Derek knows his face does something stupidly tender because Stiles\u2019 eyes go liquid, his cheeks flame up and he ducks his head. Derek pushes his chin up, kisses him slow and deep. Stiles sighs into it, before pulling away, grinning wickedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe adoring later,\u201d he says, sucking on Derek\u2019s lower lip and bucks his hips up into Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, boss, bossy,\u201d Derek chides, and Stiles laughs brightly, pinches Derek\u2019s nipple in revenge.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have the desired effect; instead, Derek arches into it, kisses Stiles hard. Stiles shoves at his pants, kicks his own off and there\u2019s a tangle of limbs and clothes before Derek\u2019s on his back, Stiles stretching out, gloriously naked on top of him. Derek\u2019s never been so turned on his life as he is in their dingy on call room, bathed in darkness and the sounds of the street, the hospital around them. It\u2019s sheer ridiculousness.</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d he huffs out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d Stiles agrees, sucking on Derek\u2019s fingers and making him groan at the sensation. He wants to put his hands all over Stiles, discover every curve of his body, learn every way Stiles likes to be touched. Stiles licks Derek\u2019s palm, spits in his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop looking at me like that, that\u2019s for later,\u201d he chides.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry for lookin\u2019 at you,\u201d Derek grouses, pulling a face at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t look at all,\u201d Stiles smirks, slides his hand down and wraps it round their dicks, eyes on where his fingers are curling round Derek\u2019s cock the whole time. Derek can\u2019t help the guttural noise he makes when Stiles starts to jerk them off together.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says loudly, \u201cFuck it all to hell, that\u2019s so fucking hot. You are so fucking\u2014\u201d He dips to kiss Derek again as Derek tries desperately not to come all over Stiles\u2019 hand too soon.</p>\n<p>He pushes his own hand down to curl round Stiles\u2019, tightening the grip and speeding the rhythm up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to come fast, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs hysterically, \u201cThis will not go down as a moment of longevity, trust me,\u201d he gasps as Derek thumbs the head of his dick, smears pre-come around, \u201cIt was never going to be drawn out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProwess is for suckers,\u201d Derek teases, and Stiles starts laughing again, knees Derek in the thigh as his back bows elegantly. Derek slides his other hand down it, grips his ass, slips the tip of a finger lower, and presses in against Stiles\u2019 hole.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles whines, mashing their mouths together, and Derek can\u2019t focus, can only pant against Stiles\u2019 mouth, too much skin, too much heat, so <em>much</em> of Stiles. He can feel the bright, sharp tingle of his orgasm building, twists his wrist frantically, losing all rhythm, desperate to take Stiles with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cLet go, I\u2019m gonna\u2014I\u2019m gonna take care of you, I promise, come for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, god, I\u2019m <em>so</em> done for,\u201d Stiles complains before he cries out, stilling on top of Derek and coming between them. Derek grins, skates his knuckles across the mess and Stiles bats his hand away, takes over with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a loser with your stupid romantic everything, even when I tell you not to be,\u201d he says reproachfully, eyes heavy lidded as he looks at Derek. \u201cYou\u2019re so contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d Derek manages, throat dry, and he tips his head back.</p>\n<p>He feels Stiles lick up the side of his neck, graze his teeth under his ear, \u201cI do,\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>Just like that Derek\u2019s done, his orgasm streaking through him, pleasure exploding across his senses, Stiles\u2019 salty sweat skin on his tongue, his firm, come slick hand on his dick, Stiles surrounding him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say that was a fine first effort,\u201d Stiles announces exhaustedly, propping his chin up on Derek\u2019s chest a few minutes later.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s heart is still beating frantically, and he nods, slides a hand up Stiles\u2019 bare back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really am enjoying all the different ways I make you speechless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flashes a grin, ducks his head to look at him, \u201cI look forward to seeing if it goes both ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shivers charmingly, Derek continues to smile as his eyes drift closed. Stiles really is charming, Derek is so very charmed, so very warm and sated and so very <em>happy</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being very agreeable,\u201d Stiles rubs his nose against Derek\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m gonna use this fact to my advantage, you know,\u201d he adds in a whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no doubt,\u201d Derek says lazily, pushing up to kiss Stiles again, just because he can.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d someone glides a finger down Derek\u2019s nose, rubs their thumb under his eye and Derek drifts into wakefulness, blinks at that someone across the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d Stiles asks innocently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am now.\u201d He rolls into Stiles, lays a palm across his back and pulls him close, \u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d he mumbles, \u201cSleep good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to get up,\u201d Stiles murmurs, curling into Derek regardless, \u201cNight shift\u2019s gonna be banging on the door any minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmf, tell them t\u2019go \u2018way,\u201d Derek yawns, rubs his cheek against the pillow and he hears Stiles chuckle, \u201cWhat?\u201d He leaves his eyes shut, pats Stiles\u2019 skin, \u201cWhat\u2019re you laughin\u2019 at?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a little panda,\u201d Stiles says gleefully. \u201cIf this was anyone else, I\u2019d be filming it for the internet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek frowns, \u201cNo one else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Derek, you know you\u2019re the only one for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Kay, good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, this is what you\u2019re like in the morning before work? Why don\u2019t you bring <em>this</em> Derek to work?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, this Derek\u2019s your Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like all the Dereks,\u201d Stiles says quietly, threading his fingers through Derek\u2019s hair. Derek hides his face in Stiles\u2019 neck, tries to avoid the light filtering through his eyelids and bask in Stiles\u2019 warmth, breathes him in, savours it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Stiles kisses his forehead, then moves away and Derek growls at the cold air as Stiles gets up. \u201cCome on, we got kids to patch up. You remember them? You like them, they like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Derek rolls onto his back, throws one arm over his face, and uses the other to reach blindly for Stiles, finds his hip and pets at it. \u201cTime is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTen after seven,\u201d Stiles starts moving, and when Derek cracks an eye open he sees he\u2019s getting dressed. Stupid clothes, stupid priorities. \u201cDerek\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmf, alright,\u201d Derek sits up, throws the pillow at Stiles\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud bang on the door, and they both jump.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave you guys half an hour extra, for the sake of true love,\u201d Danny groans through the wood, \u201cPlease let me sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek throws on his shirt, wipes his face before padding over to the door, and Danny half falls through it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo thoughtful of you to crack the window,\u201d he mumbles nose diving on the bed opposite.</p>\n<p>Derek looks at the window in surprise, and then at Stiles, who rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of us is smart,\u201d he taps his head, \u201cOne of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m that, too! Lucky you, you got the whole package!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek beams, suddenly, excitedly, and Stiles freezes on the bed, blinks up at him as his face softens.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>did</em> want the whole package,\u201d he says quietly, looking oddly relieved. Derek needs to tell him until he gets it. Derek is so in this. For good.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet <em>out</em>,\u201d Danny yells into the pillow.</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs his shoes, Derek\u2019s hand and pulls the door shut behind them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn a scale of one to everyone, how many people do you think Scott and Allison told last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d Derek grumbles, jogging down the stairs beside Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I was worried that\u2019d be your answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hesitates at the door to the ground level, looks down at their hands, and then at Stiles. \u201cIs that, something that bothers you?\u201d he asks as evenly as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Stiles chews his lip, \u201cI just thought it might bother you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I care what <em>anyone</em> thinks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Stiles flails a little, \u201cThey\u2019re going to make a huge deal out of this, for a long time, we won\u2019t get a moments peace. I think Allison might have a banner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins, \u201cSo, you\u2019ll have something else to hang over your bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2014\u201d Stiles grabs his collar and kisses him, hard and fast, \u201cYou\u2019re a very surprising person, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody ever thought so before,\u201d Derek says dumbly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, nobody knows you like I do, then, which, the no one else thing?\u201d Stiles arches an eyebrow, \u201cGoes both ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says immediately. \u201cWas that the talk we needed to have last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Stiles fusses with his collar, winks at him, \u201cSeems like it was pretty easy, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems like a lot of things are,\u201d Derek ribs, and Stiles jabs at his side, shoving him out onto the ER floor. They stumble across the floor together, and Allison visibly rolls her eyes when she sees them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun at work today, honey,\u201d Stiles says sweetly, tightening Derek\u2019s tie in the break room for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d Stiles tries, pressing his chest against Derek\u2019s, \u201cPaging <em>Doctor</em> Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say there\u2019s a medical emergency in your pants, or anything along those lines, we\u2019re never having sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMusic to my ears,\u201d Isaac grumbles as he staggers into the room, throwing his scarf and hat on the couch before collapsing on top of them, \u201cGo away, I have ten minutes before I have to fill in like fifty reports for why our rig got so fucked this year. I need a power nap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d Stiles sits on his legs, pats his head, \u201cYou want me to being you some coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a donut? With sprinkles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd sing you a lullaby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off me, Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles cackles, leaping off Isaac and at Derek, instead, \u201cYou go on up, I\u2019ma go get cranky caffeine and sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a saint,\u201d Derek remarks wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wanders up to the second floor, half reading charts and half eating a Twinkie he stole from Stiles\u2019 locker. He pauses inside his office door, and there\u2019s a banner over the desk saying \u2018<strong>Congratulations, <strike>It\u2019s A Boy!</strike> On The Sex.</strong>\u2019</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only just managed to get it down and shove it in a drawer when Erica comes in.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019up, boss, you\u2019re late for rounds, and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because you decided to get ahead on your spring cleaning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh ha,\u201d Derek kicks the drawer shut, \u201cI\u2019m on my way. Tell me about Clara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPatient presented with dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are her stats like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Erica hands him the chart, \u201cCould be worse\u2014what\u2019s that on your\u2014is that a hickey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek slaps a hand over his neck, feels his face flush up, \u201cNo, it\u2019s, uh, I fell,\u201d he clears his throat, harrumphs a little, \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for\u00a0 you to comment on my appearance,\u201d he manages finally.</p>\n<p>Erica kinks an eyebrow, \u201cIf Dr Stilinski shows up with hickeys, you have to buy me lunch, <em>and</em> sit with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy on <em>earth</em> would I do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause, you were late to rounds and I didn\u2019t tell on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one to tell,\u201d he huffs. \u201cI\u2019m the boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could tell Finstock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t care, <em>at all</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning folks,\u201d Stiles says brightly from behind them and Erica crows when her eyes zero in on the much more obvious array of hickeys round Stiles\u2019 collar at around the same time Derek does.</p>\n<p>He feels something <em>good</em> lurch in his chest, and tries to tamp down on it. He should not be feeling anything but professional in the work place.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a <em>lying liar</em> who screwed around in the work place last night.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s maybe going to hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see we\u2019re going to have an awkward moment,\u201d Stiles looks down at the chart in front of him determinedly, \u201cSo, we\u2019re going to call them allergies and move on, okay?\u201d He heads into the ward without looking at anyone, and Derek can see his ears are pink.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s okay with going to hell if he gets to admire Stiles\u2019 ears for the next forty years first.</p>\n<p>Boyd hands Erica twenty bucks as he follows Stiles, and Erica stashes it in her pocket looking smug. \u201cTold you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRookie mistake,\u201d Boyd shakes his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways bet on the gruff ones having weaknesses for the cute ones,\u201d Erica sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you get <em>any</em> work done?\u201d Derek asks flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an IQ of a hundred and thirty three,\u201d Erica beams at him, \u201cI get bored.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that,\u201d he puts all of his charts in her arms, \u201cYou run rounds today; show me what you can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek heads for the first bed, \u201cHi Clara, I\u2019m Dr Hale, this is Dr Reyes,\u201d Derek smiles widely at Erica, \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a little chat about you with me here, if that\u2019s alright? Would you like to join in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clara eyes them for a moment, and Erica winks at her, hands her a lollipop. \u201cOkay,\u201d Clara decides.</p>\n<p>Derek suspects Erica\u2019s already been making friends with Clara, patients never warm to <em>him</em> that quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready for lunch?\u201d Stiles appears at the office door a few hours later, and Derek looks up, can\u2019t help but smile at him. \u201cOh, or,\u201d Stiles slips inside, shuts the door, \u201cWe could totally\u2026\u201d He wiggles his eyebrows at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek gets up, loosening his tie and pushes into Stiles\u2019 space, kissing him soundly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he says after a moment, and Stiles\u2019 face falls, \u201cI uh, have to have lunch with Erica?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>already</em> bored of me?\u201d Stiles pretends to pout, and Derek rolls his eyes, kisses him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe can sit with us, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019ll convince Boyd to sit with us, too!\u201d Stiles\u2019 eyes light up, \u201cWe can finally bond like you two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t bonded,\u201d Derek arches an eyebrow, \u201cThe only thing we have in common is that we both have a weakness for tall, lithe doctors with nice hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d Stiles grins, pulling Derek close with his tie, \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think Boyd has a crush on <em>you</em>. Which, is actually a good thing because I would <em>not</em> beat him in a dual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, holds onto Stiles\u2019 hand all the way down to the cafeteria. Scott waves them over, and Derek nudges his chin against Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou go on, I\u2019m gonna find Reyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee if you can sweet talk Boyd into coming, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I be jealous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles says brightly, \u201cFreaking <em>pined</em> over you for four years, but now I\u2019ve got you I think I\u2019m gonna trade you in for a younger, even more stoic model.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPined?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh, wrote your name and mine in the margins of all my notes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat seems rather unprofessional.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it drives Finstock crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d Derek chides fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing\u2019s changed at all,\u201d Lydia sighs contentedly, resting her chin on her hands to beam up at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles flops down in his seat, \u201cNo comments until I\u2019ve at least had something to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek strides across the cafeteria to where Erica\u2019s hovering.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d she says when Derek gets close, \u201cYou\u2019re sitting with Dr Martin, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Derek promises, \u201cYou and she have a lot in common.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Erica gushes out a breath, shoulders dropping, \u201cTwo compliments in as many days, oh my god, you\u2019re warming up to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, directs her to the line-up, \u201cIf you want to get on her good side, get the yule log and tell her you can only manage half.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Boyd?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica jerks her head to a table in the corner where Boyd\u2019s pouring over notes, a half-eaten sandwich forgotten in his hand. Derek heads over, stops in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Boyd doesn\u2019t look up, \u201cI have notes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek whips them out of his hand, and Boyd looks up, outraged, \u201cTrust me, if I\u2019m asking you to sit with us, it\u2019s a sign. You should eat lunch with your people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Across the room, Allison flicks a strawberry at Scott and he leaps up to catch it in his mouth, Stiles cheers, Boyd pulls a face.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Those</em> are my people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want them to be, and you really don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d Derek waves a hand around the empty table, \u201cAlone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd nods slowly, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 people are tough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but, they\u2019re worth it,\u201d Derek spins away, \u201cCome on, before I change my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet it was Dr Stilinski\u2019s idea anyway,\u201d Boyd huffs, jogging to catch up with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe always has the best ones,\u201d Derek says with a hint of pride in his voice, and Boyd makes a retching sound.</p>\n<p>Derek pays for his and Erica\u2019s lunch, directs the interns over to the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone, Erica and Boyd, Boyd and Erica, everyone, be nice,\u201d he adds in a steely tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo ironic coming from you,\u201d Erica mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove her,\u201d Lydia declares, sliding her chair along to make room for Erica.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you would,\u201d Allison leans forward, \u201cSo, when do you fly out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChristmas Eve\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Boyd,\u201d Scott carols Boyd into sitting down beside him, \u201cScott\u2014you\u2019re my best friends intern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a <em>lot</em> about you,\u201d Boyd nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Scott\u2019s eyes shine excitedly, and he leans over to hook an arm round Stiles. Stiles squawks in surprise, mid conversation with Isaac and pats his friend\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd grins ruefully, digs into his sandwich. Derek sits down opposite Stiles and steals an apple slice off his tray when he\u2019s not looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cChocolate milk?\u201d Scott asks, leaning back into Boyd\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Danny appears at their table, \u201cIt\u2019s like Santa sent me a Christmas miracle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lowers his apple piece, feels Stiles kicking his feet under the table and traps them with his own. \u201cDanny\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all invited to come carolling, and by invited I mean required, and by required I mean on pain of Lydia destroying you if you say no to me,\u201d he beams widely at them all. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t sing,\u201d Boyd says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, you can stand in the back and hum, we always needs more hummers.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence for a moment, and then Isaac sighs, pained, \u201cFine,\u201d he scrapes his chair back, \u201cBut, only because it\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, you don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Danny reminds him, \u201cThis has been discussed, up,\u201d he claps Stiles on the shoulder, \u201cEveryone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison dusts her hands off, whips a Santa hat out from where it\u2019s been sitting on her knees and handing one to Scott. \u201cAnyone else need one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I got these,\u201d Stiles digs around in his satchel, pulls out reindeer ears. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he winks at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he says drily, \u201cYou got me some, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about you,\u201d Stiles teases, and Derek feels the corners of his mouth turn up, even as Stiles is leaning across the table and putting reindeer ears on his head. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Christmas spirit!\u201d</p>\n<p>They clatter up from the table as a group, head for the elevators as Danny hands out sheet music, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t know it, make <em>some</em> noise and it\u2019ll do just nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac makes a braying noise like a donkey, and Danny trips him casually, \u201cNothing like that, Lahey, or I\u2019ll surgically remove your hand in your sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>god</em>, so I feel so at home,\u201d Erica murmurs, and Boyd chuckles.</p>\n<p>The elevator opens, and Jackson Whittemore looks up over his glasses, a smirk forming. \u201cWell, well\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac grabs his tie, pulls him out of the elevator, and ushers everyone else inside, \u201cOnly I\u2019m allowed to ruin the spirit of Christmas,\u201d he snaps over Derek\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Jackson opens and closes his mouth a few times before the doors shut in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing you in a whole new light,\u201d Lydia says breathily. Isaac grins at her brightly, lifts his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Scott sighs, \u201cWhy is it always in the elevators?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHospital clich\u00e9 rule number one,\u201d Boyd shrugs, \u201c\u2019S\u2019why I use the stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI use the stairs for the cardio,\u201d Erica says simply.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wise woman,\u201d Boyd nods, and Erica elbows him in the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look really cute,\u201d Stiles whispers audibly to Derek, \u201cJust so you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>The entire elevator awws and spins to <em>stare</em> at Derek. Derek steps on Stiles\u2019 toes.</p>\n<p>Halfway round the Cardio ward, Finstock joins them. It is a thing of beauty. Derek\u2019s spent the last half an hour being <em>deafened</em> by Stiles and Scott\u2019s enthusiastic repertoire of Jingle Bells, Jingle Bell Rock and various other carols, decimated by their incorrect lyrics, but the patients have looked at them with happy, bright eyes, and Danny\u2019s handing out candy to anyone who can have it, dimpling away. They\u2019re a gruesome bunch of singers, but they mean well, the spirit of Christmas and all that crap. Derek\u2019s probably feeling lenient about it all because Stiles keeps groping his ass when no one\u2019s looking, and grinning at Derek mischievously. Having their own secrets, being conspiratorial with him, it\u2019s always been something Derek\u2019s relished. It feels even bigger, even better now he knows he can follow Stiles when Stiles dances away from him, laughing manically, can crowd him up against stray walls and kiss him.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep it off the floor,\u201d Finstock yells from their right, \u201cWe\u2019ve got dozens of offices, in fact, don\u2019t you two have a home you can do this in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDanny made us stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he did, this is Christmas,\u201d Finstock says incredulously, \u201cChristmas is a time for being merry, and bringing joy, and sticking with your damn family\u2014go catch them up, and I want to hear both of you singing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe may not be my favorite anymore,\u201d Stiles mutters into Derek\u2019s neck as Finstock strides off up the corridor after everyone else.</p>\n<p>Derek grins, nuzzles unapologetically against his cheek, \u201cHe has a point, we do have apartments\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Stiles pulls back and arches an eyebrow, \u201cAnd, what would we do there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d Derek rubs his hands up and down Stiles\u2019 arms, shrugs, \u201cGet take out? Watch a couple of games?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake Christmas cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBake \u2018em <em>all</em> day, till they\u2019re all hot and delicious and ready to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWay to euphemism.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, I try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d Danny leans around the corner, \u201cDerek! We\u2019re not finished!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither were we,\u201d Stiles sing songs back, and Danny scrunches up his nose in distaste.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a <em>hospital</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Stiles wrinkles his nose back, Derek finds it adorable.</p>\n<p>Stiles slides his hand down to find Derek\u2019s, laces their fingers together, \u201cHey, do you wanna stay over?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow, Christmas Eve, you know, Isaac is, and Allison\u2026 You could\u2026 stay, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek widens his eyes in mock concern, \u201cBut, where would I sleep if Isaac\u2019s got the couch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, the floor,\u201d Stiles jibes, dragging him up the corridor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Derek mumbles into his ear as they join the rest of the group, \u201cIf that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shudder, presses back against him and Derek\u2019s eyes flutter shut for a second, \u201cThink you can wait whole two days till Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe worth it,\u201d he says finally. Stiles winds Derek\u2019s hands round his waist, slips them under his sweater and Derek rests them on his hips, has no idea what he\u2019s supposed to be singing. He garbles out something as Stiles drags his fingers up and down Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Stiles presents Derek with something as he\u2019s packing up for the night, vaguely thankful he doesn\u2019t have a pet or a plant seeing as he\u2019s not been back to his apartment in weeks. They\u2019re going to Stiles\u2019 for a crash sleep session before Christmas Eve madness. No ER is ever safe from the <em>joy</em> of Christmas.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d He picks his glasses up, peers at the paper Stiles is wafting in front of him, and feels his stomach jump at the form he\u2019s looking down at. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, all clean,\u201d Stiles wiggles his eyebrows, \u201cDid ya know if you get tested down at the clinic on fourth, your sister finds out and comes and threatens you in the waiting room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014yes,\u201d Derek says faintly, \u201cI went yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, clambers into Derek\u2019s lap in a chair that\u2019s really not meant to fit two, \u201cGreat minds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMine aren\u2019t back, but,\u201d Derek swallows, looks at the ceiling, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been with anyone. Before you, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to see if Cora would yell at me, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be yelling at you,\u201d Derek huffs, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault I was an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no she wasn\u2019t yelling about that,\u201d Stiles grins lazily, runs his thumbs along Derek\u2019s jaw and kisses him soundly, drops kisses down his chin and at the hinge of his jaw. \u201cShe was mad I let you brood for so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Derek frowns, trying not to tip his head back in a silent request for Stiles to keep kissing his neck. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be abusing her power there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, and his breath is hot and ticklish against Derek\u2019s skin, making him squirm, grip Stiles\u2019 hips tight. \u201cI can\u2019t believe of the three of you, you\u2019re the only one that isn\u2019t frightening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora is not as scary as she thinks she is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, okay. But, Laura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about my sisters when you\u2019re grinding down in my lap, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhh, <em>feisty</em>, is someone in need of a nap?\u201d Derek glares at him, and Stiles beams back blithely. \u201cYou\u2019re cute. Come on,\u201d he clambers out of Derek\u2019s lap, \u201cWalk me home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winds his scarf around his neck, sets Stiles\u2019 hat straight when they get to the doors of the ER.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles scrunches his nose at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>so</em> your Christmas card for next year,\u201d Danny says sailing past. \u201cDon\u2019t die in the blizzard; I wanna be free of this place as soon as you\u2019re back tomorrow. My mom\u2019s making dinner and her potatoes,\u201d his eyes go dreamy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s are better, bet you ten bucks,\u201d Stiles says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more bets,\u201d Derek huffs, grabbing Stiles\u2019 gloved hand and yanking him out into the snow, Stiles\u2019 laughter swirling round with the snowflakes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Considering Derek\u2019s group of friends were extremely enthusiastic about celebrating the holidays, they don\u2019t actually get up to do so until noon. They had a late night in the ER, and everyone\u2019s sleeping off the effects as Derek stirs his coffee, looks out of the living room window, and up at the hospital in the distance. He\u2019ll probably call in to check on his patients in an hour or so, just in case. He\u2019s okay with giving himself breathing room, trying to put some space between himself and his job, making room for Stiles, for this, but, he needs to keep his finger on things. He knows Stiles will call, too, so, he\u2019s not too bothered about appearing obsessed. It eases some almost unrealized fear in Derek\u2019s chest, to know Stiles has the same approach to working as him. That he understands Derek\u2019s commitment to his job, his patients, but that he\u2019s more than willing to drag Derek away, and keep him away, now he knows where Derek\u2019s cracks are.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s appreciative, is all. No need to get sentimental. He sips his coffee, and Isaac rolls over on the sofa, snuffles in his sleep.</p>\n<p>Derek considers finding a marker pen and drawing holly on his face.</p>\n<p>Better not, he decides, padding back through to Stiles\u2019 bedroom.</p>\n<p>Stiles is awake, propped up in bed with a red ribbon on top of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck it out, I\u2019m your present.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, clambers up on the bed and hands Stiles his coffee as he kisses him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Stiles pulls the bow off, sticks it in Derek\u2019s hair. \u201cI thought I\u2019d help you with the unwrapping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine that will be a thing that happens more years than not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd on your birthdays,\u201d Stiles says seriously. \u201cSometimes you take so long I just wanna,\u201d he makes a throttling motion with his hands, \u201cRip it all off for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could do that now,\u201d Derek tugs at the faded hospital tee Stiles is wearing, \u201cOnly don\u2019t rip this, I like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S\u2019yours,\u201d Stiles says against his mouth, lowering himself onto the pillows and pulling Derek with him. \u201cYou left it here once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep it, I like it on you,\u201d Derek murmurs, kissing Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he tugs at the loose collar, pushes it down further for more access to skin.</p>\n<p>Stiles sucks in a breath, presses his fingers into Derek\u2019s back, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got a Cristina Aguilera cd somewhere, you want me to dig it out, set the mood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins, pushes Stiles\u2019 shirt up and mouths at his chest, \u201cThink we\u2019ll live without it.\u201d He scrapes his teeth against Stiles\u2019 nipple and Stiles jerks his knees up, cages Derek between his legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, okay, joke time is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen is it ever over with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can guarantee at some point there will be laughter in the bedroom, probably at my expense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pauses from where he\u2019s been sucking a mark just beneath Stiles\u2019 left pectoral, \u201cI\u2019d never laugh <em>at</em> you,\u201d he says softly, kissing the skin stretched over his ribs, feels his heart beating against his mouth. It\u2019s the most intimate moment he\u2019s ever shared with someone in bed. Trust in it he still feels like he hasn\u2019t earned. Quiet, half-dressed and sleepy, Stiles\u2019 skin warm to the touch and his fingers gentling through Derek\u2019s hair. Derek looks up at him, smiles faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says simply. \u201cI\u2019ll probably laugh <em>with</em> you a lot. Not here, though,\u201d he slides his hands up Stiles\u2019 sides, down again, stroking his hips, left hand skating over the curve of his ass.</p>\n<p>Stiles groans, \u201cYou\u2019re such a <em>jerk</em>, I don\u2019t know what to <em>do</em> when you say shit like that, or <em>look</em> at me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBask in it?\u201d Derek suggests. Stiles lets his legs fall open, and Derek trails his hand delicately over Stiles\u2019 inner thigh, runs his thumb along the join of his knee before curling his hand around it and pushing himself up to catch Stiles\u2019 mouth in a kiss, fitting neatly between Stiles\u2019 legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Stiles tugs at his shoulders, spreads his hands wide against Derek\u2019s back and pulls up his t-shirt with them. \u201cOff,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cTake it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sits up in his lap, tosses his shirt away. Stiles follows him, cradles Derek\u2019s face in his hands as they kiss. He pushes until Derek\u2019s the one on his back, stretched out across the bed, with Stiles\u2019 weight on top of him, covering him. Stiles rolls his hips, slow and deliberate and Derek arches into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d he breathes out, hooks his thumbs in Stiles\u2019 boxers, and pulls back to look at Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, \u201cYeah, do you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says immediately, \u201cAnything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know I wasn\u2019t gonna ask if you wanted to go get ice cream or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs, slips his hand into the heat of Stiles\u2019 boxers, curls his fingers round Stiles\u2019 cock, hard and wet at the tip. \u201cYou don\u2019t really seem in the mood for ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSubtlety\u2019s never been my strong point,\u201d Stiles gasps, bucking into Derek\u2019s hand. \u201cHow do you want this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want everything,\u201d Derek croaks out, riveted by the flush spreading across Stiles\u2019 chest, the way he\u2019s biting his bottom lip, red and inviting. He leans up and catches it between his teeth, kisses Stiles until he\u2019s breathless with it, still working his hand round Stiles\u2019 dick.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have the flexibility,\u201d Stiles frowns, \u201c<em>Everything?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs, \u201cMaybe not all at once. You mentioned something the other night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah? That stick with you, huh?\u201d Stiles catches his wrist, rolls away from him and shirking his boxers as he does. Derek swallows his tongue as he takes in the long lines of his back, spackles of moles and freckles everywhere and further down to his ass as Stiles wiggles around on his knees. Derek doesn\u2019t know where to <em>start</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta get\u2014\u201d Stiles yanks open a drawer, rummages around and Derek gets rid of his own pyjama pants\u2014Stiles\u2019 again, slightly too long\u2014 they made him feel stupidly warm when he put them on the night before as they\u2019d stumbled towards the bed in tandem.</p>\n<p>Stiles whips round, and claps a hand to his chest, \u201cJesus, you gotta warn me before you get all\u2014 all <em>naked</em> and lie across my bed like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll page you next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, the fun we could have with those,\u201d Stiles grins, crawls back over Derek and sits on his lap. \u201cYeah, this is\u2014\u201d he rocks down and Derek feels his dick jump, fitting snugly up against Stiles\u2019 ass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>trouble</em> we\u2019d obviously end up in,\u201d he argues in a strangled voice as Stiles coats his fingers in lube.</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm, half the fun,\u201d Stiles presses a finger to his entrance, and Derek watches, entranced. \u201c\u2019S\u2019been a while, so, this is gonna be slow,\u201d Stiles pants, \u201cYou should\u2014help me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says stupidly, oblivious to anything else in the world but where Stiles\u2019 finger is disappearing into himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Derek</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d Derek grabs the lube, slicks up his own fingers and winds his arms round Stiles\u2019 back, twists them so that Stiles is underneath him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d he groans as he presses one of his fingers carefully in next to Stiles\u2019. He teases against the rim before pushing in, shallow thrusts that get deeper into all enveloping heat, and he kisses Stiles, hard and open mouthed. Drags his cheek along Stiles\u2019 and the rasp is loud in the room, filled only with their breathing, the sound of skin against skin.</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls his hand away completely, lets Derek take over. He rakes his nails down Derek\u2019s back, draws his legs up higher.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels ok, feels <em>good</em>,\u201d Stiles murmurs, \u201cYou can do two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Derek works two fingers in, stretching them apart, slow and deliberate.</p>\n<p>Stiles bites at his shoulder. \u201cFuck,\u201d he exhales sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou feel,\u201d Derek can\u2019t explain it, doesn\u2019t have the words, has never had the words to describe what Stiles does to him, how he feels about him, instead he kisses him, pours everything he has into it.</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles against his mouth, runs a finger round the edge of Derek\u2019s lips, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes a soft, needy noise as Derek slides in a third finger, brushes against his prostate. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019M\u2019not gonna,\u201d Derek promises, curling his fingers and Stiles arcs off the bed. \u201cYou look incredible,\u201d he says unthinkingly.</p>\n<p>Stiles flushes, slaps his shoulder, \u201cShut up, fuck, you should really\u2014god, <em>there</em>\u2014fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek pulls his fingers out, and Stiles whines, pushes at Derek\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Derek finds himself on his back, Stiles sinking down on top of him, hands spread on Derek\u2019s chest, mouth open and eyes dazed. He holds himself still, desperate not to push up into the heat, the delicious way Stiles feels all around him. He runs his own hand up Stiles\u2019 side, tightens the other round his hip as he gives an experimental thrust.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles drops his head back, \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks like Derek\u2019s favorite kind of dream, except, this is <em>real</em>. When he sits up to mouth at Stiles\u2019 clavicle he can taste Stiles\u2019 sweat, kiss the hollow of his throat, when he pushes his hips up, Stiles moans and it vibrates against Derek\u2019s chest. He can feel it. Their mouths meeting, Stiles\u2019 fingers gripping his hair, his thighs straining as he holds himself up over Derek, crashing back down and making Derek see stars.</p>\n<p>Derek holds his hands under Stiles\u2019 ass, sets up a slow, rolling rhythm as Stiles pushes down to meet his thrusts. He circles his hips, and grins viciously when Derek lets out a noise of surprise, clutches him tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek grunts, barely able to keep focus. \u201c<em>Stiles</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smirks, leans down to kiss him and it changes the angle, makes Derek\u2019s eyes flutter shut.</p>\n<p>He gets a hand round Stiles\u2019 cock, jerks him off in time with his thrusts and Stiles keens. Mumbles his name into his mouth, random praise, losing all rhythm as he pushes back on Derek\u2019s dick and then into his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna come,\u201d he gasps. \u201cGod, can you\u2014 <em>harder</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, plants his feet on the bed and drives up into Stiles relentlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, god, Derek, <em>Derek</em>, god, <em>fuck</em>,\u201d Stiles bites down on Derek\u2019s bottom lip, drops his head onto his shoulder as he comes, coating Derek\u2019s stomach with come. \u201c<em>God</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek soothes a hand across his back as he comes down, and Stiles mouths wetly at his neck, \u201cYou close?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says in a strained voice.</p>\n<p>Stiles wiggles on top of him, \u201cCome <em>on</em> then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek groans, flips them and drops onto his elbows, kissing Stiles hard as he shoves into him with no finesse. It only takes a handful of thrusts, Stiles digging his heels into Derek\u2019s ass, clutching at him, muttering about how good Derek feels, how beautiful he looks, and Derek\u2019s coming inside him with a frayed shout.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Stiles pets a hand through Derek\u2019s hair, squirms underneath him, \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much compatible everywhere, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs breathlessly, presses a kiss to his shoulder as he pulls out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmf,\u201d Stiles rolls into him, ducks his head under Derek\u2019s chin, \u201cShower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, in a\u2014min\u2014\u201d Derek swallows, pats his thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep on me, Hale.\u201d Stiles nips at his neck, holds his teeth against the skin and Derek tries not to shudder. He shuffles down the bed, runs a clumsy hand across Stiles\u2019 face, and Stiles hums into it, \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Derek grins back. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Stiles curls closer, \u201c\u2019S\u2019a good start to Christmas I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe celebrated with a bang.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek covers his face laughing.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When they emerge from the bedroom, Allison, Scott and Isaac are in the living room, curled up watching Die Hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d Allison asks brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> did,\u201d Isaac drawls, \u201cAnd then was rudely awoken this morning by Stiles praying. Loudly. Repeatedly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very devout,\u201d Stiles sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, to Derek\u2019s dick apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Scott scrunches up his nose at Isaac, waves his spoon at his bowl, \u201cI\u2019m eating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone noon,\u201d Derek points out, \u201cYou were all asleep an hour ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even <em>try</em> to keep quiet,\u201d Scott turns to glare at him, \u201cI <em>had</em> to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuy some earmuffs,\u201d Stiles says loftily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho wants presents?\u201d Allison interrupts, elbowing Derek gently as she passes over towards Stiles and Scott\u2019s tiny Christmas tree. At the top of the tree is a star with a picture of Finstock\u2019s very angry face stuck to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe!\u201d Scott\u2019s eyes light up and he grabs Stiles\u2019 arm, pulls him onto the couch, \u201cSeriously, bro, we\u2019re all\u2026 happy for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for me too,\u201d Stiles beams at him, \u201cAnd for Derek. Derek are you happy for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery,\u201d Derek says drily, sitting at their feet and accepting a present from Allison. Stiles wraps his ankles round Derek\u2019s waist, catches a present Allison tosses to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSweet, thanks, socks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom Lydia, so, doubtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles unwraps a very expensive looking, sky blue silk tie, and quirks an eyebrow at Derek, \u201cYou think it\u2019s got some decent durability?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smirks, unwrapping a similar tie in a darker, richer blue.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow cute,\u201d Isaac mocks.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the hell up and open your own presents,\u201d Stiles whips the tie at him. \u201cEven though you shouldn\u2019t need any, seeing as you don\u2019t <em>believe</em> in this holiday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe in the spirit of giving,\u201d Isaac retorts, waving his own present for Stiles above Stiles\u2019 head.</p>\n<p>\u201cDouche,\u201d Stiles snatches it out of the air, \u201cThanks, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose <em>are</em> socks,\u201d Isaac says, and Stiles crows when he sees they have a dinosaur pattern on.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kids\u2019ll love these.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you often stick your feet in our patient\u2019s faces?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scrunches his nose at Derek as Allison unwraps a bright pink watch from Danny and immediately puts it on.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, unwrap this next,\u201d Scott says nervously, handing Allison a thin package.</p>\n<p>Allison takes it, frowning a little at Scott\u2019s face, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, just\u2014\u201d Scott flaps his hands. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles squeezes Derek\u2019s shoulder, and Derek feels suddenly nervous for Scott, too. Even though he has no idea what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott,\u201d Allison breathes out, looking through the half opened wrapping paper. \u201cThis is a picture of that house on the corner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott bites his lip, nods, \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, I put down a deposit. You\u2019ve always said you liked it, and I figured, we could go look round. It went up for sale in October. It\u2019s not ours, or anything yet, I can\u2019t afford the mortgage by myself,\u201d he smiles widely, \u201cBut, if you\u2019re interested\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison flies out the armchair and kisses Scott passionately.</p>\n<p>Stiles squeezes Derek\u2019s shoulder so hard he suspects he might get a bruise.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles leans against the kitchen counter as Derek pulls out plates for their belated Christmas lunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never opened your Christmas present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek picks his bag up off the floor, hands Stiles a package, \u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles rips the paper off, laughs when he sees <em>Derek Hale thinks I\u2019m splendid</em> in a needlepoint sign, framed. \u201cThanks,\u201d he tugs at Derek\u2019s vest, kisses him. \u201cYou plan that one in advance, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was a joke at the time, I know you told me not to get it. But,\u201d Derek rubs the back of his neck, \u201c\u2019S\u2019pretty spot on, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, \u201cWell, you should open mine. It was more last minute, but I think it might uh, show how much I reciprocate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls the small package towards him, arches an eyebrow at the way Stiles is twisting his hands nervously. \u201cYou wanna do the honors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt any other time,\u201d Stiles gives a hysterical laugh, \u201cBut, this one\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek tears the paper, frowns at the little brown box. When he pulls off the lid he sucks in a breath, blinks down at a key in a familiar shape. \u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so you can come home any time you want? Even if I\u2019m not here? Or, with me and you can let us both in\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to move in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s fast, <em>super</em>-fast, but I figured Scott won\u2019t be moving out for a couple of months, he and Allison will have a lot to sort first. And, we can keep on being like we are\u2014but, you\u2019ll still have this. Even if it doesn\u2019t work, I just never want you to feel like you can\u2019t be here, that you won\u2019t have me. This,\u201d he adds quickly, waving his hands around.</p>\n<p>Derek sets the key on the countertop, considers it for a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He twists and presses Stiles up against the counter, kissing him firmly. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep the key?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the metaphor, and your terrible sweaters and everything else. <em>You</em>.\u201d Derek kisses him again, feels his heart swell in his chest as Stiles slides his hands up his back, smiles at him like Derek\u2019s just given him the whole world.</p>\n<p>Stiles frees a hand to push Derek\u2019s glasses up his nose, \u201cYou wanna call in, check on things?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lifts Stiles up onto the counter, his fingers catching on the key and making him smile wider. He steps between Stiles\u2019 legs and Stiles hums, winds his arms round Derek's neck and kisses his cheek. Derek turns and finds his mouth, murmurs against his lips, \u201cWe can leave it, just for a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
