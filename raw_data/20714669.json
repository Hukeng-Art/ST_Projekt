  "text": "<p>When Hizashi\u00a0wanders into the teacher\u2019s lounge that morning, Shouta locks eyes with him and there\u2019s no point in even <em> pretending </em>he isn\u2019t crying.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d left the house at different times--Shouta usually can\u2019t sleep through the night and so a few days a week he patrols before school starts, while\u00a0Hizashi\u00a0does his radio show before school and patrols before that (Shouta still has no idea if Hizashi sleeps, several years into their marriage). Their morning routine together often begins when they meet at the school, and that\u2019s not usually a problem.</p>\n<p>Except today, apparently. Because, again, Shouta is crying<em> . </em>Shouta hasn\u2019t cried in public since their wedding (well, since about fifteen minutes after their reception was over, when he\u2019d started getting emotional because the wine finally caught up with him). So, logically, Shouta understands why\u00a0Hizashi takes one look at him and bolts across the lounge to sweep Shouta into a hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t make it any easier for Shouta to get a grip on himself, that\u2019s for sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0Hizashi\u00a0asks, when he\u2019s successfully gotten a hold on Shouta and he\u2019s made sure that Shouta isn\u2019t injured somewhere. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta pulls back to glower at him, and wipes his eyes with the back of his sleeve. The other teachers, largely gathered around the coffee table, keep shooting them awkward glances. Shouta wonders how long they\u2019d been trying to get up the nerve to ask what was going on. If All Might had been on time for once, maybe the situation would be different, but nobody else is really on Shoulder-to-Cry-On status with Aizawa.</p>\n<p>Not that Shouta would allow All Might to touch him when he was upset (or ever). He\u2019s so grateful that All Might is allergic to being a responsible employee.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, he\u2019s getting distracted from the real issue at hand--which is that\u00a0Hizashi is going into full hero mode and Shouta needs to divert that as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em> nothing </em> ,\u201d Shouta says, frustrated. He gestures to the coffee machine, which is sort of smoking. \u201cI just tried to make some damn coffee and it <em> broke. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Hizashi looks so <em> concerned </em> . He lifts a hand to wipe tears off of Shouta\u2019s cheeks, and examines his face closely for any signs of something <em> else </em>going on.</p>\n<p>Shouta scrubs at his face again, because the tears are threatening to make a resurgence. \u201c<em> Ugh. </em> I got hit with a quirk this morning because I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going. My eyes were really bad today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi\u00a0says, sympathetic, and Shouta knows he\u2019s thinking of the eye drops that he\u2019d seen on the counter at home, forgotten. \u201cDo you need--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I have some in my office. Plus, you know.\u201d Shouta gestures slowly to his face, which is still blotchy. \u201cGot it covered. It\u2019s the quirk that\u2019s making me like...this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, the quirk is making you...cry?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta scowls, embarrassed at even having to explain himself. \u201cIt appears to be making me cry whenever I feel an emotion that, perhaps, a very emotional person would cry at.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re hydrated,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says. There\u2019s a complicated look on his face that only Shouta can decipher--and he realizes it\u2019s because Hizashi is shifting from being <em> real </em> concerned towards being <em> mock </em>concerned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a joke to you?\u201d Shouta asks, but he\u2019s borderline-smiling, which is <em> much </em>better than the desolate feeling he\u2019d had right before\u00a0Hizashi had come in. He looks back at the broken coffee maker, and the smile is gone. \u201cI can\u2019t teach a class like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout coffee?\u201d Hizashi teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit, then.\u201d\u00a0Hizashi pats Shouta\u2019s arm, consolatory. \u201cIt\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. You know, some people cry <em> every day </em>. Maybe it\u2019s just catching up to you, and it isn\u2019t a quirk at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta rolls his eyes magnificently, almost a full-body movement. \u201cI specifically recall a man swearing at me for making him drop his groceries, and activating his quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you just spend too much time around that kid Midoriya,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says, ignoring his husband\u2019s words, and brushes his hand over Shouta\u2019s cheek. Across the room, Nemuri snorts, and Shouta shoots her a betrayed look. \u201cIt\u2019s really sweet that you\u2019ve bonded so closely with your classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta puts a palm over\u00a0Hizashi's face and pushes him away, gently, but still hard enough for\u00a0Hizashi to know that Shouta doesn\u2019t enjoy being bullied this early in the morning. He\u2019s now been reminded that there\u2019s a ninety-percent chance of him crying in front of class 3-A, which is the nightmare scenario. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping on the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0Hizashi glances at the clock, and so does Shouta, and to both their dismay, there are only a few minutes before they need to head to their respective classrooms. \u201cLet me walk you to class, alright?\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says. \u201cI missed you this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d Shouta says. His eyes fill with tears again as he speaks, just because his husband makes him feel loved just by looking at him. \u201cDammit<em> . </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to be a laughingstock. Admitting that he got hit by a quirk, not on patrol, but because he was too irresponsible to grab his eye drops on the way out the door, would be humiliating.</p>\n<p>Shouta zips the zipper of his sleeping bag so that only his forehead is showing, and he lies very still at the front of the class as he hears the children slowly congregate at their desks. He needs to steel himself, because one worrying comment or flinch or downcast look from these damn kids is going to make him bawl again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta may not <em> seem </em>like it,\u00a0 but he knows himself. And he knows that this quirk is going to do more damage to his reputation than the time he\u2019d accidentally worn one of his husband\u2019s sweaters to school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(It had been the only thing in the drawer on laundry day, and he\u2019d grabbed it without thinking, not even noticing the bright yellow lettering that said TURN UP with a little cartoon of\u00a0Hizashi in his Present Mic getup underneath. Shouta always gets dressed in the dark at three in the morning, so it\u2019s hardly his fault.\u00a0Hizashi still won\u2019t let him forget it.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Hitoshi says as he comes in, and nudges the sleeping bag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Shouta says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHizashi said you had a good patrol last night,\u201d Hitoshi says, a lilt of teasing in his voice.</p>\n<p>Shouta doesn\u2019t unzip the sleeping bag, but he says, \u201cGood to know that my beautiful family is constructed on a foundation of schadenfreude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that word means,\u201d Hitoshi tells him, and then proceeds to contradict himself with an overly earnest, \u201cbut good luck in school today. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta says, in a suspiciously thick voice, \u201cGet into your seat before the bell rings,\u201d and Hitoshi <em> laughs </em> at him.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, the aforementioned bell rings. Shouta clears his throat and says, muffled into the layers of fabric, \u201cFree study period, for your upcoming exams. Keep it to a dull roar. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alright, so maybe he\u2019s feeling a little bit like a coward today. It\u2019s better to let the students have some relaxing time now, because the next few weeks are going to be hell for them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a short nap. The students are more than happy without lecture and they don\u2019t bother him further. Shouta has no idea what time it is when someone pokes his sleeping bag, but he sticks his face out and blinks irritably at who turns out to be Yaoyorozu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, sensei,\u201d she says. She coughs into the crook of her elbow, a rough scraping noise that says she has the cold that\u2019s sweeping through the school right now. \u201cI\u2019m finished with my homework. Can I go get coffee? I\u2019ll bring you some.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta blinks at her again, bleary-eyed, and weighs the pros and cons. Yaoyorozu isn\u2019t someone who often gets recognized on the street for being a UA student, and she\u2019s probably just going to the small cafe in the cafeteria anyway. The only issue would be if another teacher saw her walking around, so he reluctantly gets out of the sleeping bag to find her a hall pass. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone I\u2019m allowing this. I don\u2019t pick favorites.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, sensei,\u201d Yaoyorozu says seriously, and trails closely behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may take your girlfriend with you, but I\u2019m trusting you to be responsible. Be back before class is over. I take my coffee with no sugar.\u201d Shouta goes to zip the sleeping bag back up, but he\u2019s stopped by Yaoyorozu saying, \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>She glances over her shoulder to the side of the classroom nearest the door, and Shouta follows her gaze to Uraraka.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the students have moved out of their normal seats, clumping up in groups to work or chat quietly. But Uraraka\u2019s still in her regular seat, hunched over a notebook, staring through it with a grimace on her face like something\u2019s hurting her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCould I take Uraraka too?\u201d Yaoyorozu asks. \u201cShe...I don\u2019t think she\u2019s eaten yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta has been aware for several months that Uraraka Ochaco\u2019s family has issues with allowing for a robust food budget for their daughter sometimes. Still, today is <em> today </em>, and the image of Uraraka valiantly trying to scrape through her English homework despite the fact that nausea is clearly distracting her hits Shouta differently.</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa?\u201d Yaoyorozu asks, sharp with concern.</p>\n<p>Shouta is crying. He calmly gives the hall pass at Yaoyorozu, along with the change in his pocket to pay for his coffee, and says, \u201cGo before I change my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you...\u201d She\u2019s staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sugar,\u201d he says firmly, despite the fact that tears are streaming down his face faster and faster. \u201cGet Uraraka some breakfast, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need--?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta isn\u2019t sure what else he needs to say for Yaoyorozu to get her to forget this, but he finally decides on, \u201cThis isn\u2019t real. I got hit with a quirk at work last night that\u2019s making me do this at inopportune times. I suggest you don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowns, but she turns and goes back to her desk to grab her wallet, and then she goes and collects Jirou and the two of them coax Uraraka out of her seat. Shouta doesn\u2019t pick favorites, but Yaoyorozu is definitely high on the list.</p>\n<p>Shouta makes a break for his sleeping bag, as casually as possible, but before he can disappear inside, he hears someone ask, \u201cIs Aizawa <em> okay </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d someone else says. When Shouta turns to fix a glare on them, he finds that it\u2019s Kirishima and Kaminari who have blown his cover.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their comments have silenced the class, and now everyone is staring at Shouta. Even Todoroki, who usually takes all of homeroom to wake up fully and had previously been half-asleep against Midoriya\u2019s shoulder, is watching him warily. All of these kids look so <em> worried </em>about him, as if something is actually wrong. The anxious look on Sero\u2019s face alone makes Shouta shudder with an involuntary sob.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hitoshi, in the back next to Todoroki, is the only one who looks vaguely amused. He has his phone out, probably to send a video to\u00a0Hizashi, but with one look from Shouta, Hitoshi sets the phone back on his desk, sulking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d Shouta says to the class, trying to sound as flat as possible. \u201cPlease go back to studying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d Asui says into the heavy quiet.</p>\n<p>His students all care so much. It\u2019s what guilts Shouta into explaining himself, shattering his meticulous image forever. \u201cI mean it when I say it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve been hit by an unfortunate quirk and it\u2019s going to take a couple days to wear off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a weird quirk.\u201d Midoriya perks up, no longer looking like All Might\u2019s been hit by a car right in front of him. \u201cAre you just crying continuously, or is it triggered by something? It would be really powerful to force someone to cry for a long time, because that could dehydrate you eventually, so I assume it\u2019s on-and-off, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta refuses to wipe the tears off of his face. Maybe if he ignores them altogether, everyone else will too. This particular bout of tears is slowing down anyway, now that he isn\u2019t faced with sixteen distraught toddlers. \u201cIt\u2019s on-and-off. It\u2019s triggered anytime I feel <em> anything, </em>from what I can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>This gets them chattering amongst themselves, finally lessening the attention on him, so he can clean himself up a little bit. Shouta should have expected this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(He sets a mental timer to see how long it\u2019ll take them to weaponize this knowledge against him.)</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it used defensively?\u201d Midoriya presses for more information, leaning forward on his desk, kneeling on the seat of his chair. \u201cHow did it work in combat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Telling part of the truth earlier had been the most rational course of action, but it\u2019s out of the question to reveal <em> anything </em> about the fact that a sleep-deprived, anxious Shouta had forgotten his eye drops at home and had crashed into some poor middle-aged asshole who had been carrying his bags of groceries home at seven in the morning. (Maybe it was that asshole\u2019s own fault for getting up that early to go <em> grocery shopping </em>.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Shouta says noncommittally. He tries very hard not to be endeared when he sees that Midoriya is already scribbling something in one of his notebooks about the incident. \u201cCould you perhaps be looking for a way to weaponize your own crying?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> As if Midoriya doesn\u2019t weaponize his crying enough. </em> All Might would level a whole block of buildings if Midoriya got sniffly enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShitty Deku just wants to study that stupid quirk so he can find a way to stop crying at everything,\u201d Bakugou contributes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya flushes red, but bites back with, \u201cMaybe <em> you </em>should learn more about it so you can feel something for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you,\u201d Bakugou threatens, but strangely, neither his nor Midoriya\u2019s hackles are raised. It almost seems like they\u2019re friends, these days. Shouta\u2019s eyes prickle, and <em> thankfully </em>, he\u2019s given a distraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good point,\u201d Todoroki says, in an uncharacteristically loud tone for homeroom. \u201cHave we considered the possibility that it\u2019s Midoriya\u2019s fault that Aizawa is like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sounds like a conspiracy theory,\u201d Iida says, torn between interested and exasperated.</p>\n<p>Hitoshi, with the evil smirk of someone who\u2019s been texting\u00a0Hizashi for the last fifteen minutes, says, \u201cNo, he has a point. Midoriya cries like, every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not!\u201d Midoriya says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s crying right now,\u201d Ashido accuses, pointing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> not </em>,\u201d Midoriya protests, tearful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima says, \u201cWho cares if he is! It\u2019s super manly to express your emotions instead of bottling them up. Midoriya cares about his friends, and it\u2019s really cool that he shows that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido mimes throwing up the whole time Kirishima\u2019s giving his impassioned speech. Kirishima elbows her once he notices.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting off-topic, kero,\u201d Asui says, and nods back to Todoroki. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki pushes his bangs out of his face with his free hand, and sits up straighter as his bullshit theory starts gaining traction in his head. \u201cI\u2019m <em> saying </em>, maybe it\u2019s because Midoriya makes everyone around him more empathetic. By osmosis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s gay,\u201d Bakugou says. \u201cAre you fucking gay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Shouta says sternly, on reflex, because despite the fact that everyone is well aware of Bakugou and Kirishima\u2019s intricate and confusing slow-burn courtship rituals, Bakugou\u2019s harsh tone makes Midoriya tense up and duck his head. It appears there\u2019s still unresolved issues, there.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugou snarls, gesturing to Todoroki, who is actively holding hands with Midoriya. \u201cHe\u2019s literally being gay right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt takes one to know one, bitch,\u201d Ashido says to Bakugou over the sound of everyone\u2019s snickering. Midoriya kind of relaxes, much preferring the trend of his classmates bullying Bakugou instead of vice versa, and Kaminari puts a protective arm around Midoriya to further pull him back into the present.</p>\n<p>Strike that; Shouta\u2019s on the verge as Midoriya beams at his friends again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Considering the fact that it took all of them about a day in the dorms to start using the fire alarm system for evil (Kirishima to this day vehemently denies that it was him who set a stack of homework on fire so that the fire alarms would go off and interrupt Aoyama\u2019s forty-five minute shower/concert), it takes longer than Shouta had expected for his students to get into the phase of using the quirk against him. If he\u2019d wanted to avoid it completely, Shouta <em> should </em>have confiscated Hitoshi's entire phone. His mental timer runs out as Hitoshi clears his throat and diverts the conversation and says with his most cherubic face, \u201cAizawa, could I say something on behalf of the class? We really love having you as a teacher. Thank you for keeping us safe and for teaching us so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta\u2019s going to ground this kid. His vision gets blurry. \u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d he says with no inflection whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Oh </em>,\u201d Ashido coos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is going to be a very long class period.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yaoyorozu shows up fifteen minutes later with two drinks in her hands, a more-vibrant-looking Uraraka, and Jirou holding a box of tissues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaminari whines, \u201cNo fair why did <em> they </em>get to go get food?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta accepts the coffee and the tissues, coolly ignoring the smug look that Jirou is giving him. Yaoyorozu had clearly explained the situation to her companions, because Uraraka doesn\u2019t spiral to the same level of worry as the others when she first sees the tears steadily streaking down Shouta\u2019s face. (These current tears are courtesy of a card that the class had just made five minutes before, most of the students\u2019 signatures gathered around a sketch of Shouta with hearts around it. It\u2019s absolutely hideous, and the sobs that it had resulted in were...not something that Shouta ever wanted anyone to see.)</p>\n<p>Uraraka\u2019s face has some color back in it, and she laughs like she\u2019s feeling much better. She says, \u201cIt must feel good to cry. Please don\u2019t be embarrassed, sensei! We cry all the time in this class!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, it\u2019s not just Midoriya,\u201d Jirou agrees.</p>\n<p>Midoriya nods his head, not rising to the bait or even looking up from another piece of shitty art that he\u2019s making for Shouta.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, even All Might cried a couple days ago!\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cBecause he\u2019s <em> manly </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he cried because he\u2019s Midoriya\u2019s secret <em> dad </em>,\u201d Todoroki contradicts, because apparently the only thing that can get him awake before ten in the morning is getting on a conspiracy theory kick and drinking half of Yaoyorozu\u2019s coffee. The image comes, unbidden, of Todoroki at the beginning of first year, detached and glassy-eyed and angry and withdrawn--and it\u2019s such a cognitive dissonance from how energetic Todoroki is right now, cuddled amongst his classmates, that Shouta has to wipe his face with the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p>Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have let Yaoyorozu go for coffee. It makes Shouta worried about these kids in final examination season, when all of them are going to be subsisting fully on caffeine and they\u2019re <em> all </em>going to be like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki says, adamant, \u201cThink about it for a second. All the teachers who love Midoriya suddenly getting all teary-eyed? Makes you think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hitoshi examines his nails, feigning detachment. \u201cI agree. Aizawa <em> does </em>seem to be acting more parental lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent point,\u201d Ashido says. Her face is serious; it\u2019s difficult to tell whether or not she understands the irony of this at all. \u201cHe\u2019s almost soft.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy any of you,\u201d Shouta says, which is difficult to get out because his voice is so rough by now. His sinuses are stuffy. He feels like his head is going to explode.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re your favorite class! Present Mic told us,\u201d Hitoshi gloats.</p>\n<p>Shouta is <em>going to ground him</em>. And then he\u2019s going to figure out the equivalent of <em>grounding </em>for his husband. And then he\u2019s going to figure out a way to get back at his family without punishing them for caring about him in their own awful way.</p>\n<p>\u201cPresent Mic says a <em> lot </em>of things, and it goes to show you that you should question even those you look up to,\u201d Shouta says evenly, and then throws another diversion at the students. \u201cFor example, he also believes that the last All Might movie was good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari says, \u201cWait, but it wasn\u2019t <em> bad </em>! It just got picked up by a different studio!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Jirou says, and puts her face in her hands as Midoriya, seemingly activated like a sleeper agent by some specific trigger words, launches into a thorough, courtroom-ready argument tearing down <em> All Might: Ascendance. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he\u2019d been thinking ahead at <em> all </em>, he would have made this into some sort of learning experience for his students. Instead, he\u2019s sitting on the table at the front of the classroom, alternating between scolding his students when they get too rowdy and dissolving into tears at random intervals.</p>\n<p>He glances at the clock. Shouta\u2019s been wading through the shards of his dignity for an hour now, and his feet are getting cut up. He feels fine dismissing the class a few minutes early, and he points to the door and speaks up so he can be heard over the fourteen animated conversations that are taking place. \u201cGet out of my class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFeel better, sensei!\u201d Ashido says as she bolts from the classroom with Kirishima in tow, not faltering at all when Shouta glares at her.</p>\n<p>He gets quite a few reassuring words and smiles from his students as they file out, and Shouta accepts Midoriya\u2019s drawing and a brief sneaky hug from Hitoshi, and then he\u2019s <em> finally </em>alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sits on his sleeping bag and puts his head on his knees and takes some calming breaths. This quirk wouldn\u2019t be so hard for Shouta if the kids weren\u2019t so damn <em> young </em>. They\u2019re so young, and they have so little time before Shouta can\u2019t protect them anymore.</p>\n<p>The drawing that Midoriya had given to him is splattered with tears, and he sighs and slips it into his pocket before it can get destroyed further. It\u2019s going on the fridge, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be happy about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta, somehow, lives through his next two classes. His other classes don\u2019t usually drain the life out of him in the same way that 3-A does (because his other classes don\u2019t find it enjoyable to give Shouta heart palpitations), and he chalks up his croaky voice and puffy eyes to the cold that everyone else has so that they\u2019ll give him a wide berth. Before he knows it, it\u2019s lunchtime and he can finally go slam two bottles of water and take a real nap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta can admit that it\u2019s his fault that he runs straight into All Might. He\u2019s distracted, and he\u2019s not following <em> any </em> of the advice that he gives to his students vis a vis vigilance, and he slams into all fifteen square feet of the former number one pro hero as he rounds a corner. Shouta bounces off, and hits the ground, and the shock makes him <em> cry </em>.</p>\n<p>This is the worst day of his life.</p>\n<p>All Might is freaked out, to say the least. He hurriedly pulls Shouta back to his feet, and his enormous hands hover around the vicinity of his shoulders, all the while saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eraserhead! I should have watched where I was going, I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. Are you alright? You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re feeling well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta swipes at tears that are pooling in his eyes, frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m <em> fine. </em>It was my fault, you don\u2019t need to take the blame for it. Forget about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It appears that that isn\u2019t going to reassure All Might, professional busybody. Shouta sighs. \u201cThey aren\u2019t--real tears. It\u2019s a quirk from a patrol accident.\u201d Shouta isn\u2019t going to get into the semantics of whether or not he\u2019s lying when he says they aren\u2019t real tears. That\u2019s not a discussion for now. \u201cI just need to get some water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that the truth?\u201d All Might asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no reason to lie about this,\u201d Shouta snaps. The effect is lessened because Shouta has begun hiccuping through his words, like he\u2019s an infant calming down from a tantrum.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou lie to your students sometimes, in order to achieve a favorable outcome.\u201d All Might is still waving his arms around like a moron, trying to figure out how to comfort Shouta. \u201cSo you might think it\u2019s a good lie to tell, because I would be inclined to believe it was a patrol accident.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta narrows his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d he insists, and his voice cracks like he\u2019s in high school again.</p>\n<p>All Might, hesitant, says, \u201cAlright.\u201d He pats Shouta on the head, like Shouta is <em> Midoriya, </em>and Shouta wants to die. All Might\u2019s hand could crush his head in its grip, but All Might doesn\u2019t put Shouta out of his misery. He just rests his hand on top of Shouta\u2019s hair like he could seep out everything wrong with Shouta with just that touch.</p>\n<p>The most annoying part is that All Might had passed good judgement; the pat on the head feels really good. That\u2019s what makes Shouta glare even darker as he ducks out of All Might\u2019s hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cPresent Mic is in your office,\u201d All Might says, not looking offended at all. Bastard. \u201cI passed him on my way here. He said he wanted to speak with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Shouta says, and sniffles. He still can\u2019t tell if All Might is just oblivious about the fact that he and\u00a0Hizashi are married, or if All Might missed the politeness window to ask if they were actually together and now he\u2019s going to be awkward about it for the rest of time. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He dodges around All Might and hurries down the hall towards his office. All Might watches him go, in a weirdly concerned way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hizashi greets him with a tight, reassuring hug, and Shouta fully sinks into it, kicking the office door shut behind him so\u00a0Hizashi is the only one who sees that this simple action makes him tear up again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0Hizashi asks when he hears Shouta\u2019s breath hitch, with his sweet half-smile in his voice, giving him plausible deniability as to whether or not he\u2019s being a rude bastard right now. Shouta is the only person in the world who can say for sure that\u00a0Hizashi is, in fact, being a rude bastard right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick your ass,\u201d Shouta chokes out, but he\u2019s feeling too comforted by the hug right now to actually move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hizashi laughs, and slowly smooths down Shouta\u2019s hair in a repetitive motion. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta draws back and sniffles again. His head feels like it\u2019s stuffed full of cotton balls. This is why he doesn\u2019t ever fucking <em> cry </em>. \u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already made some,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says brightly, and points to Shouta\u2019s desk, which has two packed lunches on it along with Shouta\u2019s electric kettle, and Shouta\u2019s face crumples again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re--I love you <em> so much </em>,\u201d Shouta sobs, and\u00a0Hizashi laughs softly and pulls him into another embrace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta\u2019s hoping for a downhill coast for his last few classes of the day. Ideally, he could just do some lecturing, and then bolt off campus to deal with his situation by himself without any of his students getting the satisfaction of seeing him like this again.</p>\n<p>All Might, as he is wont to do, ruins Shouta\u2019s hopes and dreams. He corners Shouta as Shouta is trying to coax himself out of his office, and asks Shouta to help facilitate hero training for 3-A.</p>\n<p>Shouta squares up to All Might, demanding to know whether All Might <em> actually </em>needs help it or if class 3-A just has All Might wrapped around their pinky fingers, but All Might gets an uncomfortably earnest look on his face and says something about inviting a lot of the other teachers and then he says some bullshit about how he\u2019s always trusted Shouta as a good teacher. Shouta flees the confrontation before All Might can see more traitorous tears falling down his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wonders, as he slurps another full bottle of water, how long this stupid quirk is going to last. By the end of lunch, he\u2019d already been feeling a little more stable, and\u00a0Hizashi had failed to get Shouta to cry with a mere compliment as they parted, so that must be progress--but he still feels like he\u2019s cried so much that he could be hung up to dry like beef jerky. He certainly doesn\u2019t want to be fighting his students right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he can find a pro hero with a duplication quirk to create a clone of Shouta to do the fighting for him. Maybe if Shouta gave one of Ectoplasm\u2019s clones some of his clothes, everyone could just pretend like it was him.</p>\n<p>He seriously considers this as he watches the students stream out of the cafeteria. It would traumatize the kids if they punched \u201cShouta\u201d and he was dispelled into ectoplasm. On the other hand, a clone wouldn\u2019t blubber its way through hand-to-hand combat with a teenager, which is sounding attractive to his shattered pride right now. It\u2019s a dilemma.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, class 3-A arrives perfectly on time, hell-bent on milking this situation for all it\u2019s worth--and his time to figure out a solution has elapsed before he can do anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(They present him with another hand-drawn card, and Shouta thanks them quietly and then does <em> not </em>run ((he speed-walks)) away from his class to go find where the teachers are congregating--more specifically, where his husband is.)</p>\n<p>\u201cRough day?\u201d Nemuri asks, amused. It hasn\u2019t escaped her attention that Shouta is leaning so far into\u00a0Hizashi's side that\u00a0Hizashi has had to take a very wide, firm stance with his feet to keep his balance.</p>\n<p>Shouta knows that his eyes are swollen, his face is splotchy, and his voice is hoarse enough that he might as well be speaking through crumpled balls of aluminum foil. He doesn\u2019t answer Nemuri\u2019s question. Instead, as he puts on his goggles, he asks Ectoplasm, \u201cWill teachers be fighting students, or teaming up with them and fighting other teachers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just obstacles,\u201d Ectoplasm says, clearly disappointed. \u201cAs in, we\u2019re not even really fighting them, we\u2019re just trying to slow them down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta turns his head back to Nemuri, silently saying, <em> you\u2019re safe for now </em>, and she shakes her head at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to feel things, Eraser,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when that happens,\u201d he says, and rebuffs all further attempts at conversation.</p>\n<p>The training situation for today is a maze. Cementoss had the time of his life setting it up, and the support class has contributed quite a few booby traps and other obstacles. The corridors have a low ceiling, keeping students like Uraraka from simply floating over all the walls to find the goal, and Shouta is given directions towards a section by the east entrance, between a gauntlet of lasers and a tightrope suspended over a deep pit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck, honey!\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says, patting him on the back rapidly.</p>\n<p>Shouta, with impressively dry eyes, says, \u201cYou too.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are five entrances into the maze, so there will be five students racing each other in each round. That means, hopefully, that Shouta will only have to encounter four of his students, unless someone gets hopelessly lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first is Iida. He\u2019s been very professional about the whole situation, and he\u2019s one of the few students who has avoided provoking Shouta\u2019s tears on purpose, so Shouta\u2019s feeling prepared for a normal fight when he sees that Iida\u2019s cleared the laser field and is rocketing towards Shouta\u2019s shadowed hiding spot.</p>\n<p>Shouta throws out his capture tape, aiming to ensnare Iida, but Iida sees him at the last minute and rockets out of the way, towards the ceiling.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a small space, but Iida moves quickly to evade capture, putting his recent internship work to good use. He twists over Shouta\u2019s head, and bolts towards the corridor stretching away from them, towards the tightrope, but Shouta uses his tape to snatch Iida out of the air and throw him back towards the lasers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iida activates his engines again, and propels himself back down to the ground, where he lands in a crouch and rolls out of the way of Shouta\u2019s tape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be half the person I am today without you!\u201d Iida shouts. He\u2019s earnest, even though the words are precise and chosen specifically to affect Shouta. \u201cI look up to you as both a teacher, and as a hero!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Shouta snaps, but the damage is done. His vision blurs, and his control over the tape loosens for a split-second in his annoyance, and Iida activates his boost and disappears down the corridor before Shouta can recover.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Shouta says, just to himself. Even without the quirk\u2019s effects, he\u2019s getting soft.</p>\n<p>The next student to appear is Jirou. She leads off with a huge blast, but Shouta cuts it off halfway through, leading her to search for other options.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiriou shouts, as she charges, \u201cMy band is having a concert on Saturday. Would you come?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta braces for impact and sends his tape out to try and ensnare her, but she spins out of the way of the tape and plants her feet and sends out another sonic attack. He erases it, and she says, \u201cMy parents don\u2019t talk to me and you\u2019re the only adult who supports my music!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t do concerts.\u201d Shouta wipes tears out his eyes, unblinking. \u201cPresent Mic would love your music; ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s at eight on Saturday and I want YOU to come!\u201d Jirou says. She unplugs her earphone jacks and lunges straight at him, ramming him in the sternum with her shoulder and in the chin with her fist, but he uses his tape to shove her back. As she\u2019s tumbling through the air, she flails around for a safe landing position, and she says, \u201cIt would really mean a lot--<em> OW, GOD </em>--if you would come, because no adult has ever gave a shit about me like you do--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Shut up </em>,\u201d Shouta hisses, because the tears streaming down his face force him to blink, and he hears Jirou scramble to her feet and sprint past him, tossing him back with an enormous sonic pulse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, sensei!\u201d she shouts as soon as she\u2019s out of combat range.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he calls from his heap on the ground, begrudging, and Jirou\u2019s laugh echoes through the hallway back to him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s ten minutes before the next student appears. Shouta hears the hum of the lasers, and the distant yelling of other fights happening. There\u2019s a rumble of concrete, somewhere, and a muffled version of\u00a0Hizashi's overwhelming sonic attacks. It\u2019s enough time to get a hold of his emotions again, and he\u2019s glad for the prep time when Uraraka appears at the end of the hallway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka clears the lasers, and charges down a side corridor, and then presumably hits a dead end and pops back into sight, annoyed at the delay.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t attack until she\u2019s very close, at which point she attempts to levitate herself to vault over Shouta\u2019s head. Shouta erases her quirk at the exact moment she tries to get momentum, and then sweeps out with his leg to knock Uraraka off balance.</p>\n<p>Uraraka opts for jumping over the leg and then kicks Shouta in the chest, effectively startling Shouta into blinking, and then she makes a break for it while he\u2019s distracted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta hits the wall hard. He recovers fast enough to catch her with capture tape, and slings her back towards the lasers. He knows that the longer he delays Uraraka\u2019s journey through the maze, the more frantic she\u2019ll get, so he needs to toe a fine line between actually starting a fight and just bothering her a little bit.</p>\n<p>Uraraka hits the ground and rolls a few meters. She doesn\u2019t get up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta says, cautious, \u201cUraraka?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has the distinct impression that she\u2019s playing dead. However, it\u2019s Shouta\u2019s job to make sure that his students don\u2019t die for <em>real</em>, so he inches forward, capture tape at the ready.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka doesn\u2019t move. The closer Shouta gets, the more he can see that Uraraka appears to be <em> shaking </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shouta asks, dropping to a crouch near Uraraka.</p>\n<p>She weakly moves an arm to wrap around her stomach. \u201cI--overdid it,\u201d she gets out. \u201cIt\u2019s been...a rough week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you get up?\u201d Shouta asks her, because it\u2019s strange for her threshold to be so low and he needs to assess the seriousness of the issue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Uraraka blinks tears out of her eyes, which in turn makes <em> Shouta </em>tear up, because the universe despises him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka turns her head sharply at the sound of Shouta\u2019s sniff, and behind her superficial expression of pain, Shouta realizes too late that his previous hunch had been correct--Uraraka is just acting.</p>\n<p>\u201cGottem,\u201d Uraraka says brightly, and smacks Shouta\u2019s arm to levitate him, kicks him back with both feet before leaping back up and bolting down the hallway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a bad strategy, Shouta admits reluctantly as he watches her vault over the tightrope area while he helplessly pinwheels through the air. It wouldn\u2019t work in real combat, and she\u2019d lost a fair chunk of time to make her acting more believable, but her crocodile tears might have practical applications in hero work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tumbles to the ground as soon as she\u2019s out of sight, and he stays there to get his energy back before the next student appears. He reaches for his water bottle and scowls at the ceiling and hopes-prays that the next student that shows up isn\u2019t a student that will play on his emotions to win.</p>\n<p>The students must be able to see the inside of the maze through cameras or something, because otherwise the probability of Hitoshi showing up as the fourth student is pushing even Shouta\u2019s bad luck to a new level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Hitoshi asks, out of breath from dodging through the laser field.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta doesn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cJirou said you cried because she invited you to her show,\u201d Hitoshi says. He isn\u2019t moving forward, he\u2019s still hesitant to leap straight into hand-to-hand altercations. \u201cMidoriya wants me to tell you that that was, quote, \u2018tender.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta opens his mouth, then closes it again. He whips the capture tape out to grab at Hitoshi, but Hitoshi leaps out of the way and focuses on evasion for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, the class says you\u2019ve replaced All Might as \u2018Most Likely To Cry at Graduation,\u201d Hitoshi says, feinting one way and then scooting along the wall in the opposite direction. \u201cThis quirk has really outed you as someone who cares about us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s slander,\u201d Shouta snaps tearfully as he lunges to stop Hitoshi. His mind goes black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up when Hitoshi comes back and pats him on the shoulder, smiling sheepishly. \u201cI lied about the class vote thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe betrayal,\u201d Shouta mumbles, kind of woozy from the brainwashing, and his son helps him back up to his feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The exercise must be over, because the ceiling and walls are sinking back into the floor around them, slowly exposing the various traps and gadgets and teachers scattered throughout the training arena.\u00a0Hizashi beams and throws up a peace sign in greeting when he spots Shouta, one of the lenses of his sunglasses shattered and blood seeping out a cut below his eye.</p>\n<p>Iida, Ashido, and Bakugou were the three fastest--Uraraka in a close fourth place, but, again, her theatrics had cost her a win--and Recovery Girl starts making her rounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hizashi bounces over, refraining from full PDA in front of the students but still giving Shouta a radiant smile and Hitoshi a hair-ruffle. \u201cHow\u2019s our crybaby doing?\u201d he asks Hitoshi.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamp as ever,\u201d Hitoshi says, sighing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouta frowns at both of them. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. It\u2019s wearing off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d\u00a0Hizashi asks. \u201cThen if you don\u2019t mind me saying it, you are the literal light of my life and every day I spend married to you is a joy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could say the same,\u201d Shouta chokes out, frantically wiping his face with his sleeve, and turns away to go find Recovery Girl to fix the cut on\u00a0Hizashi's face while Hitoshi and\u00a0Hizashi cackle at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bright side of all this, Shouta thinks, is that he might sleep through the night for once. He hears the click of\u00a0Hizashi turning the lamp off, and then soft footsteps and then the creak and shift of the bed as\u00a0Hizashi climbs in on the other side. He\u2019s trying to be so quiet, and Shouta figures he thinks Shouta is asleep already.</p>\n<p>He rolls over and slings an arm over\u00a0Hizashi's waist, latching on as securely as he can without suffocating him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says, pleasantly surprised. He moves, like he\u2019s going to do something stupid like get up. \u201cI made you some tea, it\u2019s out in the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta tightens his grip. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help you stop being so stuffy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta breathes through his mouth, and presses his forehead into\u00a0Hizashi's chest. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, you must be feeling so yucky after today.\u201d\u00a0Hizashi combs fingers through Shouta\u2019s hair. \u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta\u2019s eyes get watery, but he doesn\u2019t outright burst into tears, so that\u2019s progress. \u201cYou take care of me just fine. You put up with a hell of a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018putting up\u2019 with anything,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says. \u201c<em> I </em>was the one who had the guts to propose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Shouta says. The shirt that he\u2019s pushed his face into is getting suspiciously damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you <em> too </em>,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi hums, delighted. There\u2019s a smile in his voice as he says, \u201cIf this quirk isn\u2019t fixed by tomorrow I\u2019m fixing you up with an IV drip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you take me near a hospital for this I\u2019ll call my lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta feels, rather than hears, his husband\u2019s scoff. \u201cNot if I call her first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lawyer-poached?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d\u00a0Hizashi kisses the top of Shouta\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Both of them let the conversation end after that.\u00a0Hizashi plays with Shouta\u2019s hair for a while, braiding it together and then untangling it and starting over a few times. Shouta\u2019s almost asleep when he remembers something and mumbles, \u201cRemind me to talk to you later about turning our son against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never do such a thing,\u201d\u00a0Hizashi says, equally sleepy, and that\u2019s that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
