  "text": "<p>Peter Parker has unintentionally saved Tony Stark several times, but every once in awhile, it\u2019s entirely on purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<b>I.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tony really wants a drink. He\u2019s ready to upend every last bottle in his liquor cabinet, and he has a <em> lot </em>of liquor.</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t. He knows he shouldn\u2019t, because it could end very badly when he\u2019s in this state, but to be fair, that\u2019s never exactly stopped him before.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very, very tempting, but he\u2019s trying to be sober. He\u2019s trying very, very hard, but the nightmares aren\u2019t going away, and he just wants to sleep, just a few hours without falling or being attacked by Captain America or being waterboarded or seeing his parents die. He wants to be left the fuck alone by his subconscious so he can just get some goddamn rest.</p>\n<p>He could drink, but when he\u2019s thinking about all these things, he knows it\u2019s a bad idea.</p>\n<p>But he could forget for a while.</p>\n<p>Ugh, but last time, he got dangerously close to using that damn burner phone. He should just get rid of that thing.</p>\n<p>Well, no, he shouldn\u2019t. He can\u2019t. It\u2019s the only sign he has that he didn\u2019t <em> entirely </em> fuck up, even if he certainly fucked up a hell of a lot.</p>\n<p>He will never call. Never. He\u2019s told himself repeatedly that he will never call. He might be lying to himself, but that\u2019s not really new.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, looking longingly at the alcohol. He wants sleep. He just wants to fucking sleep. He doesn\u2019t want anything else, just a fucking break. He hadn\u2019t slept for more than a couple hours at a time in a week.</p>\n<p>Sighing, he reaches for an old bottle of scotch.</p>\n<p>He jumps as a phone begins to ring. Not <em> the </em>phone, but his own. He glances up and FRIDAY says, \u201cIt\u2019s Peter Parker, boss.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cUh, right.\u201d He looks towards his phone stiffly, before awkwardly climbing to his feet. He stumbles towards the phone and answers it, switching it to speaker before falling into a seat tiredly. \u201cHey, kiddo,\u201d he says sluggishly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stark! I was wondering if you could maybe help me with my homework? I\u2019m working on calculus, and I\u2019m not sure what to do, and Aunt May can\u2019t remember anything past geometry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stares at the phone for a second. \u201cUh. Yeah, sure, \u2018course. What\u2019re you workin\u2019 on?\u201d he asks, vaguely aware that his words are sort of slurring together, despite the fact he hasn\u2019t had a drink yet. He sets down the scotch, pushing it aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cL\u2019Hopital\u2019s rule. I, like, I sorta get it, and I\u2019ve got my notes, but I kinda zoned out for a minute, and I don\u2019t know how she did a part. Here, I\u2019ll send you a picture of the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Almost immediately, a picture comes in, and Peter continues talking: \u201cAnd so she said that this would be one to the power of infinity, but how would it be infinity? Wouldn\u2019t it be zero considering\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The teenager trails off. Tony squints at the hologram in front of him, then at the phone. He opens his mouth to ask Peter if he\u2019s plugged in the wrong limit, but then Peter groans. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m a dumbass. Never mind.\u201d He continues to grumble, and Tony can picture the teenager angrily scrubbing away his previous attempts.</p>\n<p>Tony chuckles. \u201cGlad I could help,\u201d he says, and Peter\u2019s muttering just increases in its vulgarity.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Peter mumbles. \u201cThanks,\u201d he adds, despite the fact Tony had literally done nothing.</p>\n<p>Tony rolls his eyes. \u201cSee ya, kid,\u201d he says, smirking just a little as he swipes away the call.</p>\n<p>Tony looks up from his phone and to his surrounding workspace. He breathes out with a loud puff, before standing up. \u201cAlright, FRI, gimme something to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>II.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Trudging to his bed, Tony tries to shut out all thoughts about his day. He\u2019d spent every fucking hour working through each line of the Accords, trying to assemble <em> something </em> that Rogers would at least spare a glance to.</p>\n<p>It was fucking difficult, and it was exhausting. Arguing with council members over where to put a damn comma was incredibly draining, and the genius is welcoming any sleep he can get.</p>\n<p>He falls asleep as soon as his overworked head hits his pillow.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly overjoyed to see Howard Stark standing in front of him. The man fixes him with a glare. \u201cAnthony,\u201d he says, a reprimand already on his tongue.</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, flicking his eyes towards the ceiling. He\u2019s in the workshop back in the old family mansion, somewhere he\u2019d only seen in photographs and dreams for years. Everything is just how he remembers it. Old, useless blueprints litter the room, and tools lie across the floor where he\u2019d last thrown them. He hasn\u2019t been here since he was twenty-one.</p>\n<p>\u201cDad,\u201d he says flatly, letting himself drop on one of the abandoned seats in the workshop.</p>\n<p>Howard steps forward, but instead of criticizing Tony like usual, his face begins morphing. After a few seconds, it\u2019s Obadiah standing in front of Tony, and Tony can\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>His heartbeat picks up and he has to watch as, over and over and over again, Obadiah reaches out and extracts the reactor from his chest. He watches himself be murdered again and again, until it\u2019s <em> not </em>Obadiah, but it\u2019s Steve.</p>\n<p>The shield is held high above him, before coming down and it doesn\u2019t hit his armored chest, it hits his unguarded face, crushing every bone, every vessel--</p>\n<p>He shoots up as he hears Black Sabbath start blaring beside him. \u201cWha-?\u201d he starts, his chest heaving, before he realizes it\u2019s his phone. He fumbles for it, before answering the call and holding it to his ear.</p>\n<p>He barely lets out a strangled, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Mr. Stark, I- uh, I have a little bit of an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s shaken mind clears a little as he recognizes the guilty tone in Peter\u2019s voice he\u2019s heard one too many times. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do, Parker?\u201d he asks, waving his hand so FRIDAY turns up the lights.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh, I was doing my thing, y\u2019know, uh, fighting crime, and--\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony raises an eyebrow. \u201cPeter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found a cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stares blankly at the phone before sighing. Very loudly. \u201cA cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony rubs the lines on his forehead that have just kept getting worse over the years. \u201cExplain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d just stopped this guy from mugging another guy, and I just heard these really sad and pathetic meows coming from the alley, so I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me you seriously just saved a stray cat from an alley?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Tony says, staring at his bedroom wall incredulously. How has this become his life?</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Mr. Stark, Aunt May isn\u2019t gonna take in a cat! She\u2019s allergic!\u201d Peter pleads, and Tony sighs, finally getting out of his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do?\u201d Tony asks, walking over to his closet to pull on a shirt. \u201cCan\u2019t you just take it to a shelter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, first, he\u2019s a <em> he. </em> Not an <em> it. </em>\u201d Tony\u2019s feet freeze in their tracks, and he gets the feeling he knows where this is going. Rhodey did this exact same thing in their third year of MIT. \u201cAnd\u2026 I kinda like the little guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, listen, hear me out! You get an adorable cat--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--I get to visit him whenever I want--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--You\u2019ll always have someone to spend time with if Rhodey and Vision are out, <em> and </em>he\u2019s not a dog, so you don\u2019t even need to take him out for walks or anything! C\u2019mon, Mr. Stark! Please!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony groaned, rubbing his hand across his face. \u201cI--\u201d He was interrupted by the <em> smallest </em> little <em> mew </em> he\u2019d ever heard. He paused, his mouth dropping open. That just isn\u2019t fair. He shakes his head. <em> No. </em> \u201cPeter, I don\u2019t have ti--\u201d</p>\n<p>The stupid cat meowed again, but this time\u2026</p>\n<p>Tony narrowed his eyes, walking towards his bedroom door where he\u2019d heard the sound. He threw it open, revealing a disheveled Peter Parker, holding a ball of black fur.</p>\n<p>Tony stared at the cat, before slowly bringing up his gaze to look at Peter, who at least has the decency to look guilty. \u201cPeter,\u201d he says, a hint of a warning in his voice.</p>\n<p>Peter ignores it. \u201cPlease, Tony! Please! I named him T\u2019Challa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em> kidding--\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBut come on, he looks just like him!\u201d Peter lifts up the kitten excitedly, and the damn thing does its stupid, adorable <em> mew </em>again.</p>\n<p>Tony crosses his arms, but his eyes don\u2019t leave the cat. \u201cThis is a very bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! You hear that, T\u2019Challa? You\u2019ve got a new home!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not calling him T\u2019Challa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>III.</b>\n</p>\n<p>The phone is taunting him. That stupid vision Wanda had put in his head before Ultron was cycling through his head on repeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve saved us.\u201d</p>\n<p>He <em> tried. </em></p>\n<p>Some nights, he hears <em> Rhodey </em>saying those words, and then he can\u2019t sleep for days.</p>\n<p>This is one of those times.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to call Steve. Not really. But sometimes he feels like he just needs to scream at Steve. Scream because Rhodey got hurt, because Steve didn\u2019t tell him, because Steve didn\u2019t listen, because he\u2019s <em> sorry </em> . He knows that he doesn\u2019t really have a reason to be sorry, but sometimes-- sometimes, when he\u2019s sitting in the common room while Rhodey\u2019s in therapy and Vision is moping somewhere, when he\u2019s sitting there <em> alone\u2026 </em>He misses them.</p>\n<p>He misses his prank buddy. He misses his science bro. He misses his freaky assassin friend. He misses the only person whose personality was as loud as his own. He misses his childhood-hero-turned-friend.</p>\n<p>His hand reaches towards the phone, picks it up, and he stares at it.</p>\n<p>\n<em> They don\u2019t want you. They chose what they wanted. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony swallows past the lump in his throat. He looks at the phone in his shaking hand. He wills it to still. Sighing, he rubs his other hand across his face, then his temples.</p>\n<p>God, he just wants them back.</p>\n<p>His hands hover over the buttons of the phone, but before he can do something he\u2019d probably regret, he hears the elevator doors open behind him.</p>\n<p>He twists in his seat to see Peter walk in with a crumpled suit in his hands.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes widen and his hands fumble with the phone before he shoves it in one of the drawers of the workstation. He turns around again, trying not to look guilty. \u201cHey, kid, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter eyes him suspiciously before shrugging. \u201cUh, do you think you could make my suit, uh- not flammable?\u201d he asks, and Tony can now see the scorch marks littering the suit.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you enter flaming buildings, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was getting people out of there!\u201d Peter said indignantly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re one to talk, Mr. I-flew-a-nuke-into-space!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was years ago, and it was different!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter simply quirked an eyebrow. \u201cYeah, okay, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>IV.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tony hasn\u2019t left his workshop in over a week. He\u2019s slept for about six hours, scattered evenly across those eight days, and he\u2019s consumed nothing but coffee and granola bars.</p>\n<p>He would leave the shop-- he isn\u2019t even working on super important things anyway-- but he\u2019s the only one in the tower so there\u2019s no point. Rhodey\u2019s visiting Mama Rhodes, Vision\u2019s visiting Wakanda to discuss the Accords, and- well, that\u2019s it, really. There used to be seven other people living here, eight if you include Pepper, and now there\u2019s two.</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, spinning a washer on the desk in front of him. He sets his chin on the desktop, before tilting his head so his cheek is flattened by the metal surface. He picks the washer up once it falls and sets it off again, his eyes staring blankly at the spinning motion.</p>\n<p>He feels sort of numb, a feeling that isn\u2019t exactly rare to him at this point, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it always makes his body feel cold.</p>\n<p>Sitting up, he listens to the washer rattle to a stop, and he lifted his gaze to stare at the wall blankly. Being alone is not a good idea for Tony, especially when he\u2019s in this sort of mood. Before, there was almost always someone around. He could usually find Clint at the archery range, or find Steve or Natasha on the common floor or in the gym, or he could find Bruce in his lab, or Thor in the kitchen if he was around-- he could usually find someone.</p>\n<p>Tony will always be incredibly grateful for Rhodey and Vision, but they have their own lives and they can\u2019t be at the tower all the time. Vision spends a lot of the time working on the Accords or at the compound or even occasionally helping with SI, and thanks to Tony, Rhodey has to deal with physical therapy for a large chunk of his time, and not to mention, he\u2019s still working with the U.S. military in the ways he can. Tony can\u2019t blame them for that, and he never will, but he just doesn\u2019t want to be alone anymore.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMeow.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony moves his head and he registers the small fur ball that was Tich (a solution to the confusion between the kitten and the king), sitting on the sofa in the corner of the workshop. Tony blinks rapidly, trying to snap himself out of his daze. When he focuses on the cat again, Tich is giving a small yawn, stretching out his tiny little limbs.</p>\n<p>Tony watches as the cat curls in a ball before giving him a look. It isn\u2019t <em> necessarily </em>a glare, but it\u2019s pretty damn close.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Tony asks, raising his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>The kitten has grown a considerable amount in the past three weeks, definitely has more meat on his bones, but he\u2019s still a considerably small cat. He looks even smaller curled up, and he emits another small sound.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou know that\u2019s unfair,\u201d Tony says, crossing his arms. Tich doesn\u2019t break eye contact, but instead stretches and gives a small yawn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tony feels a warmth in his chest, and it helps to dampen the cold feeling everywhere else. He sighs, watching the cat for a moment. Finally, he rolls his eyes. \u201cFine. But you\u2019re very whiny,\u201d he says, getting up from his seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tich preens as Tony sits down next to him and scratches behind his ears. The kitten stretches his back, and Tony scritches across the soft fur.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tich cranes his neck up to look at Tony and meows, before darting onto Tony\u2019s lap. Tony stills as the kitten crawls across his thighs before settling between them with a yawn. Tony slowly relaxes, allowing a smile. He carefully leans back and rests his hand on Tich\u2019s head, feeling stupidly warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He supposes he should thank Parker for finding the little guy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! They can stay at the compound, I don\u2019t fucking care, but I\u2019m going to stay away from them, and they are going to stay away from me. That was the deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The king on the other end of the line is silent for a moment. Then, \u201cVery well. I will make it clear to them that they are to stay away from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a relieved sigh, swallowing thickly and nodding. \u201cOkay. Thank you, your highness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d T\u2019Challa says, and the call ends.</p>\n<p>Tony exhales slowly, trying to gather himself as he rests his hands on the edge of the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks up to see Peter walking in, Rhodey next to him. Rhodey leans against the wall for support, looking at Tony with concern. Peter mirrors the expression, frowning with his eyebrows furrowed.</p>\n<p>Tony shuts his eyes, rubbing a hand across his face. After steadying his breathing, he drops his hand and looks at Peter and Rhodey, who are still watching him carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming. Pardoned. They\u2019re going to stay at the compound.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201c </em> What? <em> \u201d </em> The question is asked by both of them, and Tony sighs, dropping into a chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all done. They\u2019re finally pardoned. Which. Great. The world needs the Avengers, whatever, I just--\u201d His breath catches, and he lets it out in a shudder. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to see them. I don\u2019t-- Not-- and especially--\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the sound of Rhodey approaching, and he makes a mental note to make the braces quieter. A familiar hand settles on his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Tones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll punch Rogers in the face if he tries anything,\u201d Peter offers, and Tony lets out a startled laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Pete, but I don\u2019t think we need any more conflict,\u201d he says, though he appreciates it greatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t ask for permission,\u201d Peter says. \u201cPlus, Rhodey probably wants to do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey hums his verification, and Tony lets out another chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence on him,\u201d Tony says, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>Rhodey shrugs, sitting next to Tony. \u201cI think I can live with that if I get to punch Rogers in the face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey,\u201d Tony whines, but Rhodey talks over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, if I could just give that dick a black eye, I would be the happiest man alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh-uh,\u201d Peter says, sticking his tongue out in true teenage fashion.</p>\n<p>Tony rolls his eyes as Rhodey settles his arm around his shoulders, letting himself relax. He has these people, he\u2019ll be okay.</p>\n<p>Nope, nope, not okay, he\u2019s not okay at <em> all. </em></p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa may have promised to keep the Others away, but he isn\u2019t exactly able to keep that promise when he\u2019s busy ruling another country.</p>\n<p>The Others stay away the first couple weeks, but one day, Tony\u2019s sitting in the commons of the tower, sipping at a mug of coffee, when FRIDAY says in an alarmed voice, \u201cBoss, the Avengers-- the <em> captain\u2019s </em>Avengers- have entered the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony demands, shooting to his feet. \u201cWhy\u2019d you let them in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe security cameras in the front are still broken from this morning\u2019s attempted kidnapping,\u201d FRIDAY says, and Tony winces. He put off the camera repairs because he had to first take care of a malfunction in Rhodey\u2019s braces. \u201cI\u2019ve refused access to the elevators, but that\u2019s not stopping them from using the stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a sharp breath, trying to stop a verging panic attack. \u201cO-okay, FRI, don\u2019t- don\u2019t let them- don\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, Hawkeye has his explosive arrows to get through any obstacles in their path. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t-- Boss!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony slips to the floor, his hands reaching for his chest. \u201cNo, no, they can\u2019t- I can\u2019t see them. I can\u2019t, FRIDAY, I can\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Meow. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a quiet gasp as the kitten makes his way towards him, looking at him with concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cT- Tich,\u201d Tony says, reaching, and the cat hurries its pace and bounds across the floor until he reaches Tony. He sets his paws on Tony\u2019s knee, tilting his head curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them here,\u201d Tony says, his voice choking off. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispers, and Tich\u2019s ears twitch. The kitten quickly leaps into Tony\u2019s lap, gently nuzzling his stomach.</p>\n<p>Tony winces as he hears a faint explosion. \u201cFRIDAY, tell the staff to go home. Structural integrity will be fine, but I don\u2019t want anyone to panic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, you\u2019re panicking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> aware, </em> FRIDAY,\u201d he snaps, then winces. Tich looks up at him, his tail twitching. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cCompletely reasonable, boss,\u201d Friday says, her tone reassuring.</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a shuddering sigh and gently cups the back of Tich\u2019s head. The kitten nuzzles his stomach again, purring softly.</p>\n<p>He flinches as another explosion is heard.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, I\u2019m trying--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, his eyes shut and his voice tight. FRIDAY\u2019s probably locking down everything she can, but Tony designed those arrows. They\u2019re strong enough to get through anything FRIDAY puts up.</p>\n<p>Tich meows, and it\u2019s a distressed little sound, and the genius feels a pang of guilt. It\u2019s <em> his </em> fault this is all happening. It\u2019s <em> his </em> arrows, it\u2019s <em> his </em> fault they\u2019re breaking in, it\u2019s <em> his </em>fault that the security isn\u2019t strong enough.</p>\n<p>Another explosion, and Tony can start to hear the faint sound of hurried footsteps, slowly growing louder. He curls in on himself and Tich, who purrs soothingly. He buries his fingertips in the kitten\u2019s fur, trying to calm himself down, if not for his sake than for Tich\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cStaff has left the building, boss,\u201d FRIDAY says, and Tony takes some comfort in that information.</p>\n<p>He tries to steady his breathing, but it grows more and more rugged as he hears Rogers and his team approaching. <em> Stay away, stay away, stay away-- </em></p>\n<p>\u201cTony? FRIDAY, where\u2019s Tony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no business seeing him, Rogers,\u201d FRIDAY replies, and Tony notes the deliberate absence of Steve\u2019s formal title.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY,\u201d Steve says, sounding exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cRogers,\u201d FRIDAY says, sounding cold.</p>\n<p>Steve obviously gives up, as he just continues to shout for the shaken engineer.</p>\n<p>He hears another blast, and it\u2019s so close he knows it\u2019s the last one they need. He\u2019s shaking, and he really doesn\u2019t want them to see him like this, but he can\u2019t-- he can\u2019t--</p>\n<p>He screws his eyes shut as he hears Rogers\u2019s team burst into the room, but he quickly wrenches them open when he feels Tich leap from his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait--!\u201d He reaches his hands out, but Tich has already bounded up to stand in front of\u2026</p>\n<p>Tony looks up to see Steve, Clint, Scott, Sam, and Wanda. (He doesn\u2019t know where Bucky is, but hopefully away from conflict. He has a feeling that Bucky probably needs to have some peace for once.) They\u2019re all staring at Tich, looking baffled.</p>\n<p>Tich glares at the intruders and attempts a menacing growl, but seeing as Tich is an adorable kitten, it comes out more like a soft grumble. Still, Tony\u2019s heart tumbles and he whispers, \u201cC\u2019mon, Tich.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cat glances at him before glaring at Steve\u2019s team for a moment more, but then he turns around and joins Tony again, nuzzling his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cat,\u201d Clint says, and if Tony was in a better mental state, he\u2019d make a comment about his astounding observation skills.</p>\n<p>Steve blinks slowly for a minute, before seemingly remembering why they\u2019ve broken in. \u201cTony, you can\u2019t keep avoiding--\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud fumbling in the next room, and Tony immediately knows who it is. He\u2019d installed a sliding window that FRIDAY could automatically opened if a certain teenager came swinging.</p>\n<p>The intruders look startled and spin towards the door, only to be met with the door slamming open.</p>\n<p>Peter storms into the room, his mask pushed down to show his fury, and Steve opens his mouth to say <em> something, </em>but he never gets to, because he is quickly met with a right hook to the jaw.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s jaw drops just as Steve clutches his own and the others burst into outcry.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns to him, his eyebrows raised, looking entirely unimpressed as he shrugs. \u201cI told you I would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it!\u201d Tony says, trying not to pay attention to the outraged looks standing behind Rogers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I promised Rhodey! Also, when he gets back, I\u2019m totally telling him I beat him to it.\u201d Peter turns to Cap and points at him. \u201cFuck you, by the way,\u201d he says, before turning to Tich and crouching. \u201cHey, Tich! How are you? You\u2019re getting tubby, has Mr. Stark been spoiling you?\u201d he asks, scratching behind the cat\u2019s ears, causing a happy purr.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, you can\u2019t just--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Peter interrupts, glancing up at him only to return his attention to Tich. \u201cRhodey <em> and </em>Pepper gave me permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo offense, Mr. Stark, but you probably wouldn\u2019t let me punch whoever kills you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, why am I being killed? Why can\u2019t I die peacefully?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a billionaire and you don\u2019t protect yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a flying suit of armor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich you fly into danger at every opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks up to see Clint glaring at them, along with everyone else. That is, besides Steve, who\u2019s busy clutching his bleeding nose, and Sam, who\u2019s making sure he\u2019s okay. Peter looks at the archer, unfazed.</p>\n<p>Clint waves his arms for a moment, then just says, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glares at him. \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to be retired anyway? What happened to spending time with your family?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Accords weren\u2019t right!\u201d Clint says, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne, they wouldn\u2019t have affected you if you didn\u2019t come out of retirement every five minutes, and two, how the hell is accountability not right? Did you even <em> read </em>the Accords? Why did you get into this mess in the first place? You had a family to take care of!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame for you,\u201d Peter says, turning to Scott. \u201cYou also had a family that you just dropped! Did <em> you </em>read the Accords?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I </em> did!\u201d Peter says, glaring at them. \u201cYes, they weren\u2019t perfect, but they were amendable, not that any of you bothered to even <em> try </em> to listen when people pointed that out to you <em> . </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, listen--\u201d Sam starts, but cuts himself off when Peter glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you just follow him like a blind puppy! Did it not occur to you that just maybe accountability is important? That maybe the people of the world deserve to be safe? Or did you just hear Rogers say no and immediately follow him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam says nothing, just flounders for a moment, and that\u2019s enough of an answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of you thought about your actions. You would all blindly follow Captain America into the jaws of death just because he\u2019s Captain America.\u201d He looks at the captain. \u201cSo many of us looked up to you, and you deserve <em> none of it.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Steve sighs, wiping his face. His voice comes out nasally. \u201cLook, I\u2019m--\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stands up, his jaw stiff and eyes narrowed. \u201cNot sorry. Fuck you, Steve Rogers. Fuck your stupid phone. Fuck your letter. Fuck your apology. Fuck your hypocrisy. Fuck <em> you. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, standing up, lifting up Tich when he cries in protest. \u201cPeter--\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter spins on him, jabbing a finger in his direction. \u201cTony. Shut up.\u201d Tony falls silent, and Peter looks back at Steve and his team. \u201cHow <em> dare </em> you believe that you had the right to keep the truth from him? You act like you\u2019re on this moral high horse all the time, but you\u2019re a regular person who fucks up and you need to know that. You claim to protect the little people, but you ignore <em> one hundred and seventeen </em> countries full of those little people, because you think you know better than them? Not to mention, you mistreated a man who did nothing but give and give to you for <em> years! </em>You blame him for Ultron, while you happily bring in the girl who supported Ultron and was the one who planted the idea in Tony\u2019s head in the first place, and--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was under HYDRA\u2019s influence!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich she volunteered for!\u201d Peter shouts, looking ready to punch Steve again. He spins on Wanda, who\u2019s quick to flick out her magic. \u201cYou volunteered for a <em> known Nazi organization! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was young, and HYDRA promised that I could get revenge on Stark for killing my parents,\u201d she defends, as if that\u2019s helping her case in the slightest, but her magic flickers away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean his <em> weapons </em> that killed your parents? His weapons that have been repeatedly verified that he had no control over? He wasn\u2019t firing the missiles, he was making them, and it was Obadiah Stane who was dealing them in the first place! And guess what?\u201d Peter says, glaring at her. \u201cYou may have been young, but don\u2019t act like that excuses your actions. My uncle Ben died when I was young, and yeah, I wanted revenge, but I didn\u2019t jump up to join a Nazi-terrorist organization. I didn\u2019t fuck with a man who was already struggling with PTSD. I didn\u2019t try to raise an AI that would kill humanity!\u201d He turns to Steve again. \u201cYou blamed him for Ultron when he was just trying to make the world a safer place! Did any of you ever bother to ask <em> why </em>he built Ultron, instead of just fighting and yelling at him?\u201d He points at Wanda. \u201cMaximoff planted the image of you guys dying and blaming him for it in his head. He saw all of you dead, and he wanted to stop that from happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd of course,\u201d he adds, turning to the captain once more. \u201cYou berated him for hiding things, while <em> you </em>refused to tell him the truth about his parents! You knew that his parents were killed by the Winter Soldier, and you thought you could keep that information to yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have the right to decide, Rogers! That was <em> Tony\u2019s </em>right! It was never yours, but again, because you thought you could do no wrong--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to get hurt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how the hell did that turn out?\u201d Peter snaps. \u201cYou left him in a dead suit in Siberia,\u201d he says coldly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was going to kill Bucky!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t!\u201d Peter shouts. \u201cYou and I both know that Tony could have killed Barnes in one fucking shot, but he didn\u2019t! He held back, because he wasn\u2019t going to kill Barnes. You, however, you never hesitated! \u00a0I saw the footage from the HYDRA base. You slammed your stupid shield into his <em> head! </em>Do you even know how much brain damage that could have caused?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you crushed the reactor! Tell me, <em> Captain, </em>why do you think Tony blew off Barnes\u2019s arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Barnes touched the reactor. He tried to <em> tear </em> the reactor from the suit, and you fucking let him, and you <em> knew </em> that was a trigger for Tony! You knew about Afghanistan, about Obadiah, you fucking knew, and you just--\u201d Peter\u2019s words choke off, and Tony watches in horror as tears form. The teenager wrenches his eyes shut for a moment, hot tears escaping. After a moment, he looks up, revealing angry, bloodshot eyes. \u201c <em> Fuck you, Rogers. Fuck you. </em> Now, get the <em> hell </em>out of this building, because I already called the cops, and they\u2019re gathering around this tower as we speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve and his stupid team look at each other with alarm, before Steve finally gives a stiff nod. They all rush for the exit, and FRIDAY gives them a quick, \u201cLet the door hit you on the way out.\u201d</p>\n<p>As soon as they\u2019re gone, Peter slowly turns to Tony, who quickly realizes that <em> he\u2019s </em>crying as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-- I came as quickly as I could. FRIDAY told me that they were breaking in, and I was nearby so I called the police and I tried to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, thank you,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a small smile, quickly stumbling across the floor to wrap the genius in a hug. Tony lets out a sigh and relaxes into the familiar warmth. (It\u2019s funny. He never really considered himself much of a hugger until Peter came around.)</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony pulls away enough to look Peter in the eye. \u201cSorry for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve had to deal with them for so long. You\u2019re the greatest person I know, and they-- they treat you like a doormat, like they can just walk all over you and you\u2019ll still be there when they get back, and they just-- you deserve so much better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony lets out a watery chuckle, but Peter just frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gulps, and he nods stiffly. \u201cI know. Just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Peter says, smiling slyly. \u201cOne day, you\u2019ll get used to people loving and caring about you. For now, I\u2019ll just keep hugging you until it\u2019s drilled into your brain.\u201d With that, he throws himself back onto Tony, and Tony lets out a startled <em> oof </em>before returning the embrace. Tich, feeling left out, quickly joins them by stepping on their feet.</p>\n<p>Then, after a minute: \u201cDid you really have to punch him in the face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, after FRIDAY shows him the footage of the encounter, Colonel Rhodes runs as fast as his braces will carry him to the living room where Tony\u2019s helping Peter with his homework, gives Peter a high-five, hugs Tony, and curses the existence of Steve Rogers. Also: \u201cCan\u2019t believe you beat me to it, kid. Next time, <em> I\u2019m </em>breaking his nose.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
