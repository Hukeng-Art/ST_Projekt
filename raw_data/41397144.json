  "text": "<p>Eddie Munson has never been picky about his roommates.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t afford to. Not in New York City, where the cost of rent is too high to get choosy about who you live with. Eddie prides himself on his ability to get along with just about everyone, and his past record of roommates proves it.</p>\n<p>There was Gareth, an aspiring drummer who practiced day in and day out, despite Eddie\u2019s insistence that he hold off during the night. Then Fred, the former class president who woke up at the crack of dawn to make breakfast and head out to his corporate job. There was Jason, an asshole of a guy, who barely even spoke to Eddie unless he had to.</p>\n<p>Sure, they\u2019ve not been the best of friends, but they were pretty upfront with who they were. Eddie knew everything about them that he needed to know. He never came home surprised.</p>\n<p>With Steve Harrington, his new roommate as of last spring, he has no idea what to expect.</p>\n<p>The man is a mystery. He has two jobs. One as an amateur photographer at the Daily Bugle, and one that Eddie doesn\u2019t know, one he disappears at odd times of the day to work at. Eddie has ideas, sure, but none of them involve legal activities, so he\u2019s never been eager to ask.</p>\n<p>Apart from his mysterious job, he has a mysterious home life. He never lets Eddie in his room, going as far to buy a lock and hide the key. Which is a little offensive, because even Jason didn\u2019t do that, but as said before, Eddie gets along with everyone. So he doesn\u2019t bring up the fact that his landlord is going to give him hell for the lock. He just grins and bears it.</p>\n<p>He gets along with Steve, he really does. On the off chance he\u2019s home, Steve will let Eddie pick a movie, and they'll eat takeout until they can\u2019t breathe, arguing over the characters, or the plot, or the fucking cinematography. </p>\n<p>Steve hates the news. He turns it off any time it\u2019s on, even if Eddie is very obviously watching it. At first, Eddie thought maybe it had something to do with politics, but he\u2019s pretty sure Steve hates local news too. Also podcasts. So Eddie buys earphones and doesn\u2019t think much more about it.</p>\n<p>Steve is fucking strong. Eddie actually doesn\u2019t know what to do with this information, other than to tuck it in the furthest parts of his brain, underneath the neon arrow blinking the word <i>Gay Gay Gay </i>over and over. Steve doesn\u2019t even look strong. He\u2019s lean and limber, and he looks like he would do yoga, or something like running. But Eddie never expected him to have actual working muscles under his dorky grandpa sweaters.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think he would\u2019ve known, except for the fact that their neighbor\u2019s \u2014 Mrs. Byers \u2014 bookcase fell down, not properly anchored to the wall. She had asked the two men over to help her son lift it, the vintage furniture made of solid oak. To Eddie \u2014 and the Byers\u2019 \u2014 surprise, Steve waltzed right in and lifted the bookcase by himself. And then he anchored the damn thing to the wall.</p>\n<p>Eddie has never had to hide a boner so fast.</p>\n<p>And so yeah, his roommate is mysterious and strong and probably works for the mafia or something, but he\u2019s pretty cool otherwise. Maybe the best roommate Eddie has had so far. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve hates living with people.</p>\n<p>One would think he might enjoy it, having spent his entire life living alone with no one but his parents, who never stayed home for longer than a weekend. He used to be excited about the prospect of moving in with someone, of sharing takeout menus and a mailbox. </p>\n<p>This, of course, was before he got bitten by a radioactive spider, forcing him to lead a double life.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t afford to live alone, but by God does he want to, because living with a roommate runs the risk of them finding out Steve\u2019s biggest secret. New York\u2019s biggest secret, if he\u2019s being honest. And Steve has been doing this since his junior year of high school. He\u2019s good at it.</p>\n<p>Eddie Munson makes it extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>Steve has never met anyone so friendly, so insistent on getting to know him. It was almost annoying at first; Eddie always asking him to watch a movie or play a video game together. Steve had wanted to lock himself in his room with all of his computers and gadgets, wanted to yell <i>leave me alone</i> and never look at the guy again.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Eddie wormed his way into Steve\u2019s heart. Just through sheer willpower alone, which isn\u2019t easy.</p>\n<p>Steve has been on this train for awhile now. He has no idea when the Spidey gig ends, but until it does, he has to be careful with who he lets into his life. How he lets them in.</p>\n<p>He keeps Eddie at arm\u2019s length. Gives him the movie nights and the takeout and keeps the web shooters and the hostage takeovers. Gives him the grocery runs and keeps the police scanner buried underneath his bed in a box.</p>\n<p>Give and take. That\u2019s all it is.</p>\n<p>Steve might have this roommate thing down pat.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>A loud crash wakes Eddie up. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit. Fuck. Shit,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice pierces the silent room.</p>\n<p>Eddie leans up on his elbows. Squints into the dark room. \u201cSteve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Steve bumps into something. \u201cSorry, Eddie. I thought I came into my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie blinks. His head is still heavy with sleep. \u201cDid you come in through the window or is this just a really weird dream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream,\u201d Steve says quickly. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hallway light leaks into Eddie\u2019s room, and he can just barely make out Steve\u2019s form, slipping out of his room.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a dream.</p>\n<p>In the morning, Eddie shuffles out of his room in nothing but his sweatpants, ready for his weekend to start with a bagel. Steve is already at the counter, sprinkling everything bagel seasoning onto his avocado toast. He looks as normal as he does every morning, his brown hair awry, his gold-rimmed glasses slipping down his nose and\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<i>Wait. Is that a bruise?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Eddie gasps before he can stop himself. \u201cYou have a black eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve looks up. He also has a split lip. Eddie can see now, a small cut split open and scabbed over, slicing down his lower lip and chin. \u201cOh, this?\u201d He gestures to his face way too casually for Eddie\u2019s liking. \u201cI ran into a pole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you didn\u2019t,\u201d Eddie narrows his eyes. \u201cI know what it looks like to lose a fight, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lose,\u201d Steve says, and then he freezes, having caught himself.</p>\n<p>Eddie snaps his fingers and jabs his pointer between Steve\u2019s eyes. \u201cAha! You <i>were</i> in a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve blinks. It looks painful to do so, but he doesn\u2019t wince. He only shrugs. \u201cOkay. So I got into a fight. Does it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a valid question. Especially when it comes to casual roommates. Eddie has no business sticking his nose where it doesn\u2019t belong. And yet, he wants to know what happened. He wants to know if Steve is okay. </p>\n<p>But they\u2019re only roommates. \u201cI guess not,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>Steve smiles. This time he does wince. \u201cI took the liberty of putting your bagel in the toaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>And they\u2019re back to normal. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Steve hates the comedown.</p>\n<p>After the fight, after the adrenaline kick, after the perps have been webbed up for incoming police \u2014 Steve has been doing their job for a while now, let\u2019s face it \u2014 after the excitement and the sarcastic quips and the racing of his heart\u2026</p>\n<p>Once it\u2019s all over, Steve is left drained of energy. Left to swing home and use the bodega first aid kit he bought a while back to keep his wounds at bay until his skin regenerates. Thank God for that, because he can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d do if his skin healed at the normal rate. Probably die. </p>\n<p>Yeah, definitely die.</p>\n<p>He stumbles out of Eddie\u2019s room, feeling incredibly vulnerable, because he\u2019s only wearing his sweats over his suit, having decided to bundle up extra for tonight\u2019s patrol.</p>\n<p>It would\u2019ve been nice to savor the sight of a sleepy Eddie, but Steve had been too preoccupied with making sure Eddie couldn\u2019t see<i> him</i> to really stop and get a good look.</p>\n<p>Whatever. He\u2019ll be bisexual later. </p>\n<p>He rubs at his face with alcohol wipes, ignoring the sharp sting. He\u2019s not good at this part. The healing. The taking care of himself.</p>\n<p>Maybe it stems from the fact that he got his powers as a teenage boy and never actually had time to stop and learn how to take care of himself. Maybe it stems from the fact that his parents were never around to teach him. Maybe it stems from the fact that Steve has been known to be pretty hard on himself, and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s good at this \u2014 at the gentle humanity of it all.</p>\n<p>He shuts off the bathroom light.</p>\n<p>In the morning, he pretends he doesn\u2019t see Eddie\u2019s frown as he studies the wounds across his face. He\u2019s good at that \u2014 at the pretending.)</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing: sometimes, Eddie feels like he\u2019s being watched.</p>\n<p>It started a few weeks ago; this prickly feeling along the back of his neck, like someone has just brushed their fingers along his spine. It\u2019s eerie, and it happens during the night, usually when he\u2019s walking home from his late shift at the bar.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s happening right now. Eddie takes his earphones out of his ears just to be aware of his surroundings. The streets of Brooklyn aren\u2019t exactly safe, but he\u2019s usually not this on edge. </p>\n<p>His shift had been shit. He accidentally broke a bottle of expensive ass tequila, and his boss made sure to let him know it would be coming out of his paycheck.</p>\n<p>So, when a man rounds the corner of the alley, drawing a knife on Eddie and demanding he hand over his wallet, Eddie finds himself thinking <i>yeah, this might as well happen.</i></p>\n<p>He pulls his wallet out of his pocket and is just about to hand it over, ID and everything, because he\u2019s not gonna fight, when something swings down from the roof, kicking the mugger directly in the jaw.</p>\n<p>Critical hit, Eddie thinks to himself, unhelpfully. He stands there and watches New York\u2019s resident hero lecture the dude on the ethics of mugging.</p>\n<p>Of course Eddie knows who Spider-Man is. Except in his mind, he\u2019s always thought of the hero as someone like Banksy. Someone who is untouchable, a bit of a mystery to the entire city, yet still just some random dude. He can\u2019t say he ever thought he\u2019d be this close to the guy. Or maybe girl? He\u2019s not sure and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter, because whoever they are, they\u2019re walking up to Eddie. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s deepening his voice on purpose. Eddie can tell. It\u2019s probably part of the whole secret identity thing. Eddie doesn\u2019t really care. He\u2019s pretty sure he sees a different masked stranger every day on the subway alone, so forgive him if he\u2019s not incredibly wowed by this guy\u2019s presence just because he is a bit campy with the way he goes about it. \u201cYeah,\u201d he answers. \u201cThanks for, uh, saving my wallet.\u201d</p>\n<p>The spandex is tight. Eddie can see the hero\u2019s body very clearly. His tapered waist and strong thighs. The suit is doing wonders for him, and Eddie momentarily weighs the option of asking Spider-Man if he\u2019s gay. Then, he mentally chides himself for thinking he has a chance with Spider-Man. </p>\n<p>This night is really not going the way Eddie expected it to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t walk home alone,\u201d Spider-Man says. The eye lenses on his suit narrow, like he\u2019s actually upset with Eddie. \u201cDo you have a friend who could pick you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie has like, two friends in the entire city. Chrissy, who works across town in the mayor\u2019s office, of all places. She and Eddie don\u2019t even cross paths unless they purposefully make plans to. So she\u2019s out of the picture. The only other person he can think of is Steve, and that\u2019s a hard no. For all Eddie knows, Steve could be the one out here mugging. \u201cNo,\u201d he answers. \u201cI\u2019m okay, though. I\u2019m a big boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cSomeone might worry about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie raises his brows. \u201cNo one worries about me. I take this route all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake this,\u201d Spider-Man holds out what looks like a little earpiece.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA doohickey,\u201d he says, like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cYou stick it in your ear and press a button, and it\u2019ll call me. If something like this happens again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie stares at the small, hand painted spider design on the earpiece. It\u2019s a bit elaborate for the whole performative vigilante thing this guy has going on, but he appreciates the consistency in theme. \u201cUm. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Spider-Man breathes out a sigh, like he is actually concerned about Eddie\u2019s wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Maybe he is. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Spider-Man straightens up. Eddie hears a glimpse of his real voice for a moment, and it\u2019s almost familiar, but then it\u2019s back to that phony deep voice again. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d and his eye lenses are thinning like he\u2019s angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie raises his hands in surrender. \u201cJust asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man stares at Eddie.</p>\n<p>Eddie stares at Spider-Man. \u201cSo\u2026 Can I go home now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Spider-Man clears his throat, \u201cOf course!\u201d He steps out of Eddie\u2019s way and lifts his hand in a wave \u201cHave a nice night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Spidey,\u201d Eddie mumbles. He passes the hero, giving him one last scrutinizing look for good measure.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t know when following Eddie home from his late shifts at the bar became an integral part of his night patrol, but here he fucking is, standing in an alleyway, waiting for the cops to come take away the guy he probably could\u2019ve gone a little bit easier on, if he\u2019s being honest with himself.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s Eddie. <i>Was</i> Eddie. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s roommate is probably home by now, getting ready for bed. Taking a shower, running his fingers through those shaggy curls, getting out the kinks and the tangles of the day.</p>\n<p>Steve huffs. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure when his acquaintanceship with Eddie became something closer to a <i>crush</i>, but here he is, following the man home like he can\u2019t take care of himself. Sharing actual Spidey equipment with him like he\u2019s in on the secret. </p>\n<p>Steve swings away to finish his night patrol, lets the autumn wind soothe the burning heat in his face. </p>\n<p>More secrets to keep. Alter-ego, bisexuality, crush on roommate \u2014 the list is stupid and long. Steve has always been a bit of a disaster. He can never tackle one thing at a time. He\u2019s gotta be an overachiever, gotta have multiple issues to deal with at once.</p>\n<p>He fights a few more perps, helps someone get home after their car stalls, and gets home with only a few easy-to-hide scrapes.</p>\n<p>He cleans them up in the darkness of his room. Alone with his thoughts.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve takes baths often.</p>\n<p>This can be annoying because they share a bathroom, their small apartment only having room for one. So, if Eddie needs to use the restroom, he has to wait for Steve to finish up his bath. Which, if he\u2019s completely honest, never takes more than thirty minutes, tops. But after a thirty-two ounce coke from the bodega down the street, it feels like hours.</p>\n<p>Another thing that\u2019s a result of Steve\u2019s baths: the bathroom is always stocked full of good-smelling salts and scrubs. He\u2019s actually pretty sure he\u2019s going to buy Steve a Lush gift card for Christmas this year, considering the amount of little bath bombs he hoards beneath the sink.</p>\n<p>Eddie is turning a spider shaped one around in his hand, reminiscing his weird ass night last night, when Steve passes by the doorway. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a special Blueberry scent for Halloween,\u201d he says, unprompted. \u201c<i>Boo-berry</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie looks up. Steve is leaning on the door jam, arms crossed casually. He\u2019s wearing a brown Sherpa jacket over his usual cuffed jeans. The sleeves are so long they reach past his knuckles, making him look soft and cozy as he explains Lush bath bombs to Eddie like they\u2019re a foreign concept. \u201cYou\u2019ve had this thing since last Halloween?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looks sheepish. A pretty shade of pink blooms across his neck. \u201cI like putting them in my drawers to make everything smell good,\u201d he says, as if that explains everything. \u201cI probably have too many. You can totally use a few up if you want to. I should\u2019ve told you that before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie glances back at the spider. He wonders if it turns the bath water black. If that\u2019s appealing to customers like Steve. He puts it back in its place. \u201cI\u2019m not a bath guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have shower fizzers, too,\u201d Steve says.</p>\n<p>The words come out before Eddie can think to stop them: \u201cYou\u2019re fucking adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somehow, the red in Steve\u2019s neck creeps all the way up to his cheeks. \u201cThanks,\u201d he squeaks. He pushes himself off the wall and escapes, leaving Eddie with his thoughts and about thirty bath bombs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gay, is the thing,\u201d Eddie is saying as he wipes down the bar. Some asshole spilt his beer earlier and never cleaned it up, leaving a sticky residue that is now Eddie\u2019s job to fix. His manager still hasn\u2019t forgiven him for the tequila incident a few weeks ago, so Eddie\u2019s not eager to make a mistake again, if he can help it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just ask?\u201d Chrissy uses a cherry stem to poke at the floating ice cubes in her Shirley Temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make him uncomfortable,\u201d Eddie says while he pours some Guinness for a girl in a Dodgers cap. \u201cWhat if he thinks I\u2019m coming on to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Chrissy asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my roommate,\u201d Eddie gives her a flat look. He rings up someone\u2019s tab. Gives them a polite smile so they know he\u2019s not ignoring them. \u201cThat\u2019s like, rule number one of roommate etiquette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chrissy hums. \u201cI fucked Heather back when we were roommates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, well, I\u2019m not sure I have your luck when it comes to partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chrissy sips her drink through a pink straw. \u201cYou do have luck when it comes to masked heroes, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering how long it would take you to bring that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Spider-Man gave you one of his little spy gadgets,\u201d Chrissy says, eyes wide. \u201cThat\u2019s like, second base I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t know what second base is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Chrissy waves his worries away. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna call him, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie glances down the length of the bar to make sure no one needs him. \u201cPretty sure it\u2019s for emergencies only.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should just call him once,\u201d Chrissy prompts. \u201cJust to see what he does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It does happen, three days later, when Eddie is so high he can\u2019t actually think straight. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on the fire escape in a folding chair, one of the spare quilts he keeps in the linen closet draped over his lap to keep the autumn chill at a minimum. He\u2019s on his second joint, having built a pretty decent tolerance during his time here. It helps that he has an actual job now and can afford the good stuff.</p>\n<p>He blows smoke rings into the polluted sky, smiling lazily as they dissipate.</p>\n<p>He reaches in his pocket for his zippo, wanting something to fidget with, but his fingers catch on the <i>doohickey</i> instead. It\u2019s just an earpiece. He\u2019s not sure why Spider-Man calls it something different. Before he can talk himself out of it, he\u2019s clicking the button and sticking the little device in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey Speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the guy you saved from that mugging a few weeks ago..?\u201d Eddie starts. Now that he\u2019s hearing the man\u2019s voice on the other end, he feels a little stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay? Do you need help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I need help,\u201d Eddie lies. He\u2019s not sure why he lies, but he likes the idea of seeing the masked hero again. Even if he comes to take Eddie\u2019s doohickey privileges away. </p>\n<p>In reality, this guy is definitely just some rando who gets a power trip out of anonymity. Probably. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tracking you,\u201d Spider-Man says. All business. \u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay. Spider-Man is coming to his house. Eddie waits. He pulls out his zippo and flips it open, then shut, then open, then shut. Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said you needed help.\u201d Spider-Man perches on the rusty railing, resembling a red and blue gargoyle. He cocks his masked head to the side. \u201cYou interrupted my night patrol, man,\u201d there\u2019s a mechanism to his voice now. Something deep and warped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to see if it worked,\u201d Eddie says. He\u2019s starting to feel a little giggly. He\u2019s way too high. Sober Eddie would never take a risk like this. \u201cIf you\u2019d come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I would,\u201d Spider-Man says. Like he\u2019s confused as to why Eddie wouldn\u2019t trust him. Which is silly, because Eddie doesn\u2019t know him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d Eddie says. He takes one last hit before snubbing out what\u2019s left of the joint in Steve's makeshift ashtray, figuring he\u2019ll collect the roach later. Both of their bedrooms lead out to the same fire escape, except Steve actually opposes littering, and uses a sawed off McDonald\u2019s cup as a place to store old cigarettes and joints. \u201cI\u2019m not going to trust you just because you\u2019re a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m your\u2013\u201d Spider-Man cuts himself off and stands upright without the use of his arms. Just shoots right up, completely balanced. The action makes Eddie a bit dizzy. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019re you doing on this fine September night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJus\u2019 smoking,\u201d Eddie shrugs. \u201cIf my roommate was here, we\u2019d be watching some trash tv. Real Housewives or some shit. But he\u2019s off doing God-knows-what with God-knows-who.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man snorts. \u201cAre you pouting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a water sign!\u201d Eddie says defensively. \u201cI like quality time with my friends!\u201d And he likes Steve more than all his other friends, even if he\u2019s not ready to admit it. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your friend?\u201d Spider-Man sounds\u2026 surprised? Touched?</p>\n<p>Eddie is confused. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he be? Are you not friends with your roommates? I mean, assuming you have roommates?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a young adult in New York, of course I have a roommate,\u201d Spidey drawls. He walks the railing like a tightrope. Back and forth and back and forth. Arms stretched out, even though Eddie is pretty sure he doesn\u2019t need the extra balance. \u201cJust\u2026 I dunno\u2026 you can\u2019t always trust roommates, can you? You don\u2019t exactly know them from Adam.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep,\u201d Eddie says. He flips his zippo. \u201cThen again, I suppose you have to watch everyone you\u2019re around, if you\u2019re planning on keeping this whole anonymous hero thing going.\u201d</p>\n<p>The band around Spider-Man\u2019s wrist suddenly beeps, flashing a bright red blinking light. Spidey hits it, and a voice comes through, lispy and high, \u201cWe got a cartel shootout two blocks away. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re at your\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man slaps the band again, and the voice cuts out. \u201cWell,\u201d he chuckles. It sounds fake. \u201cDuty calls!\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives Eddie what looks like the rocker symbol, and then a web is shooting out of his wrist, landing on the roof of their building. Spider-Man wraps his hand around the string and uses the tension to propel himself upwards.</p>\n<p>Eddie waits ten minutes, just in case he decides to come back, and then goes inside.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Chrissy comes over one Friday with a box of pizza and a Pitch Perfect DVD. Which can only mean one thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Heather are on another break,\u201d Eddie deadpans. He pulls the door open wider, so Chrissy can come in. \u201cSteve is here,\u201d he tells her as she passes. There\u2019s some unspoken warning in the words, like <i>please don\u2019t say anything embarrassing about me.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Steve!\u201d Chrissy says, donning her sweetest voice. \u201cI hope you like meat lovers and Rebel Wilson!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve peaks over the top of his laptop. He\u2019s been editing pictures for the last hour. Eddie\u2019s pretty sure he has a deadline to meet, so he\u2019s been trying to stay out of his way. \u201cOh, thanks, Chrissy. Meat lovers is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Chrissy leaves the pizza box on the counter and peers over Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOoh\u2026 are these your pictures for The Bugle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie wonders how Chrissy does it; just jumps into a conversation like Steve isn\u2019t the cutest man alive. He supposes it\u2019s the whole lesbian thing, but still, aestheticism and all that. He opens the box and takes out a slice of pizza.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve answers. His neck is that pretty shade of pink again, almost matching the neon shade of his argyle sweater vest. He shoves his glasses further up his nose, and Eddie focuses on his copper eyes as they scan across his laptop screen. \u201cI\u2019m still editing\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey look great,\u201d Chrissy says. She smirks, glancing at Eddie. \u201cDoes Eddie know you take pictures of Spider-Man for a living?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie asks, his mouth full. He drops his pizza back into the box and rounds the counter, practically pressing into Steve as he peers over his shoulder and squints at the screen.</p>\n<p>The pictures are amazing. Eddie doesn\u2019t know much about photography, but he can tell Steve is fucking good at it. Every picture of Spider-Man looks like something out of a movie, all the right angles and perfect lighting. One hardly notices the alley of overflowing dumpsters in the background, or the gray smoke lingering behind the hero. \u201cThese are fucking metal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cT-Thanks,\u201d Steve mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie loves Spider-Man,\u201d Chrissy says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Steve tenses. Eddie can feel it in the shoulder that\u2019s touching his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. He\u2019s cool. Spider-Man, not Eddie. I mean, Eddie, you\u2019re cool\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wear yourself out, man.\u201d Eddie claps Steve on the shoulder. He feels weird suddenly, like maybe he should tell Steve that he is sort-of friends with the vigilante. Like maybe he needs to prove himself. \u201cAnyways\u2026 How do you take so many good pictures? You must know him or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Steve says. \u201cHe just\u2026 poses if I ask him to. I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie can sense the discomfort in Steve\u2019s voice. He wonders if he and Chrissy are being too nosey. \u201cWell, me and Chris are going to watch Pitch Perfect in the living room if you wanna join us.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does join them, around the halfway point of the movie, warm arm pressed cozily against Eddie\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Eddie stares down at Steve\u2019s freckled wrist lying between them. There\u2019s a devil on his shoulder telling him to reach forward and grab Steve\u2019s hand. He resists the urge. Leans down instead to whisper to Steve, \u201cSorry I never asked about your job before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve drags his eyes away from the riff-off going down on the television. \u201cDude, it\u2019s okay. I can be kind of private anyways, so it\u2019s more my fault than yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie struggles with a reply, because truthfully, Steve <i>is</i> private. He\u2019s always folding his laptop when Eddie gets too close; always locking his door with a telltale click. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. You know, photographing Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smiles. Lifts his eyebrows in a teasing manner and matches Eddie\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not getting you an autograph.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Eddie barks a laugh, startling both Chrissy and Steve, because dammit, Steve doesn\u2019t joke around with him all that often, but it feels good when he does. It feels right. Natural. \u201cYou got me,\u201d he replies, and Steve\u2019s short chuckle feels like a reward.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, is it always high stakes crime, or do you also rescue cats from trees and shit?\u201d Eddie flicks some ash off of his cigarette and watches it float all the way down to the wet pavement beneath them. The rain has just let up, and Eddie breathes in the fog with the smoke; enjoys the temporary freshness in the air as the city resets itself.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man is sitting on the railing, facing out, swinging his legs back and forth. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a lot more cats in trees than high stakes crime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich do you prefer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Spider-Man huffs. It\u2019s muffled. \u201cKinda weird to compare, I guess.\u201d He spreads his legs a bit, just to get more comfortable.</p>\n<p>His spandex-clad thigh bumps into Eddie\u2019s arm, and the weight is faint, but good. Eddie leans into it. He likes the warmth in contrast to the misty night. \u201cWanna know somethin\u2019 funny?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Spider-Man takes the bait.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know my roommate. Steve.\u201d Eddie says.</p>\n<p>He feels the muscles in Spider-Man\u2019s leg tense up. \u201cSteve\u2026 um\u2026 the photographer? He\u2019s your roommate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Eddie nods happily. He takes another drag. The smoke warms his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve been roommates for a while now. Best roomie I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eddie mumbles. \u201cHe\u2019s really secretive though. I don\u2019t think he trusts me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man retracts his leg. Eddie wonders if he said something wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just shy,\u201d Spidey says. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie hums in halfhearted agreement. \u201cThanks, Spider-Man. Don\u2019t think I could put that on my dating profile, could I? <i>Was called cool by Spider-Man</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChicks would dig it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really looking for chicks,\u201d Eddie snorts. He drops his chin to his chest, \u201cMan, that\u2019s embarrassing. Do I look straight to you? I can\u2019t believe I look straight to<i> The</i> Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Spider-Man says. Then there\u2019s a whirring sound as his eye lenses widen. \u201cI mean, not that I\u2019ve thought about it. Just, it\u2019s not my place to assume anything, and I don\u2019t want to get beat up for calling someone gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I beat you up for calling me straight?\u201d Eddie asks, tipping his head and peering up at the masked face. \u201cTell me, Spidey, how would you navigate that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Those lenses blink. Eddie wonders when Spider-Man decided he needed facial expressions to fight crime. He wonders just how smart this dude actually is, because he\u2019s taken robotics, and it\u2019s not easy. He wonders if Spider-Man is an independent act like he says or if he\u2019s actually some weird experiment run by the government. He hears that happens sometimes. Course, he\u2019s not sure how helpful his sexuality would be to Mayor Osborn, so he\u2019s probably safe in assuming this guy works alone.</p>\n<p>Eddie tosses the butt of his cigarette into the styrofoam cup behind him. He hopes he sounds nonchalant when he asks his question. \u201cWhat about you, Spidey? Dudes or chicks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence settles over the evening. Eddie should go get ready for his shift at the bar, but he\u2019s all too content to be out here with his new friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Spider-Man whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie replies. \u201cWhy are we whispering?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never told anyone before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie rubs his palms together to retain some warmth. He\u2019ll have to bring a jacket out tonight. In the back of his mind, he thinks about Steve, off wherever he is, and hopes that he\u2019s wearing a jacket. Or at least that he\u2019s somewhere warm, and not outside braving a New York autumn in nothing but a t-shirt. \u201cSounds like you trust me with your deepest, darkest secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man laughs, throws his head back sweetly. \u201cI think my deepest, darkest secret is actually my civilian identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh.\u201d Eddie waves his hand away. \u201c<i>What Does Spidey Look Like Under The Mask?</i> Boring headline, superficial. But <i>Who Does Spidey Fuck?</i> New, exciting, shocking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry and sell that to Jameson,\u201d Spider-Man snorts. \u201cJust another reason for him to hate me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why does he go so hard on his radio show?\u201d Eddie leans his chin on his palm. His watch beeps: five minutes before he needs to leave for work. \u201cYou piss him off or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. I think he just likes to complain and I\u2019m the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to goofing up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d Eddie\u2019s watch beeps again. Four minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve burned down a building or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve actually burned down a building?\u201d Eddie laughs. He\u2019s pretty sure someone\u2019s nonna is going to step outside and cuss them out anytime now for their loud laughter. \u201cLike\u2026 an evil overlord\u2019s headquarters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be a cooler story,\u201d Spider-Man swings his legs back and forth childishly. It\u2019s more endearing than it probably should be, but Eddie has a weakness for endearing, so it works. \u201cBut no, it was that old bodega two streets down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Eddie holds his hand up. \u201c<i>You\u2019re</i> the reason my trip to buy cigarettes is now a ten minute walk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d Spider-Man sounds embarrassed. He giggles, the sound warped through his voice mechanism. \u201cMaybe it'll make you kick the habit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFat chance.\u201d Eddie\u2019s watch beeps again. \u201cShit. I really gotta start walking to work, or else I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d Spider-Man jumps and turns, so that he\u2019s facing Eddie on the other side of the railing, hands caging Eddie in. \u201cHave fun at work, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie swings his leg through his window, back into his room. \u201cI\u2019ll think of you the entire time!\u201d He yells over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>The laughter he receives in return is worth the earful he gets from his manager for arriving late to his shift.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve is friends with a highschooler named Dustin Henderson.</p>\n<p>The two of them are joined at the hip in a brotherly way, with Dustin dropping in after long days at school, pestering Steve until he makes him dinner or agrees to play a video game with him. He sleeps over sometimes, if he stays out too late to take the subway home.</p>\n<p>Dustin always looks at Eddie apprehensively. He\u2019s doing it right now, after barging in the front door with the key Steve gave him and finding that Steve is, in fact, still out doing whatever it is he does at odd hours of the day.</p>\n<p>Seasonal depression has been kicking Eddie\u2019s ass, leaving him to lay on the living room couch whenever he has time off. He\u2019s wrapped in an old quilt that smells like the laundry detergent Steve has been buying lately. This means the blanket smells like <i>Steve</i>.</p>\n<p>Eddie thinks he should stop thinking about Steve, but it\u2019s hard when he lives with the guy. </p>\n<p>Dustin also doesn\u2019t let him forget it. \u201cWhere the fuck is Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Eddie shrugs. He flips through channels miserably, not sure what he\u2019s looking for. Not sure what would make him feel better. He wishes Steve were here, and they could watch something abhorrent, like cgi shark movies or Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he told me I could take a nap in his room before my shift at the lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou work now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m eighteen,\u201d Dustin says. \u201cI graduate in spring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Eddie thought Dustin was like, twelve. Maybe he\u2019s just getting older. Twenty-five years old and all these teens start looking like babies to him. \u201cWell, Steve\u2019s room is always locked, so I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to take a nap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a key,\u201d Dustin says casually, already headed for the hallway. \u201cSee you in two hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie sits up, watches him trail down the hallway like he owns the place. He furrows his brows. Wonders how long it took Steve to trust Dustin. Wonders how long it will take Steve to trust him.</p>\n<p>With nothing good on the television, he decides to follow Dustin\u2019s lead, and take a nap.</p>\n<p>It sure beats staying up and waiting for Steve.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The door slams shut, waking Eddie with a jolt. \u201cWhat the f\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!\u201d It\u2019s Steve, back at \u2014 Eddie checks his watch \u2014 eleven o\u2019clock. He came in through the front door this time. Maybe he thinks it\u2019s not that late. Eddie supposes it isn\u2019t, but with his night shift this is like interrupting his REM cycle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eddie. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice sounds strained, hurt, and that\u2019s the only reason Eddie doesn\u2019t go back to sleep. He sits up. \u201cTurn the light on, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so difficult,\u201d Eddie groans, still half-asleep and unable to filter his thoughts. He pushes himself off of the sofa and stumbles over to the lightswitch. Flips it on. \u201c<i>Holy shit</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Steve mumbles.</p>\n<p>Except it is that bad, because Steve has got another split lip, and there\u2019s blood seeping through his white t-shirt. He\u2019s clutching his ribs, back against the closed door.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d Eddie wraps his arm underneath Steve\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat the fuck do you keep getting yourself into?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018T\u2019s nothing,\u201d Steve mumbles, but he\u2019s leaning nearly his entire body weight onto Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Eddie says, suddenly frustrated. He thinks of the busted lip a month or two back. \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie helps Steve into the bathroom and sits him on the toilet. He squats in front of the sink cabinet and extracts the bigass first aid kit that Steve shoved in there. Eddie always thought it was a bit excessive, but he can see the appeal now as he sets the kit on the sink and takes out an alcohol wipe packet. He tears it open with his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, I can clean myself up\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie glares at his roommate, effectively shutting him up.</p>\n<p>Steve closes his mouth and decides to give up. He watches Eddie, eyelids heavy, face black and blue. His hands are clasped in his lap, fingers twitching like he can\u2019t stand the thought of being still.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is gonna hurt, kay?\u201d Eddie mumbles. He holds Steve\u2019s chin and tilts his head up, so that his face can be seen in the light. Steve doesn't flinch once, and the idea that he might be way more used to this than Eddie first assumed runs like bile up his throat. He swallows before he speaks. \u201cShould we tell the cops?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve, punch-drunk to hell, smiles lazily, \u201cNah, they already know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s grip on Steve\u2019s chin tightens, and he's not proud of it, but he snaps, \u201cThey know and they don\u2019t help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs and hangs his head like he's the one being scolded.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Eddie steps away, hoping to clear his head. Steve smells like blood and floral cologne, and it dogs Eddie\u2019s mind. He pinches the bridge of his nose and takes a deep breath. \u201cI just- I want you to be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve meets his eyes. Somehow, the bruises seem to already be healing. Fading. Eddie thinks maybe it's the bathroom lighting. That little split in his lip is still broken though. Steve\u2019s tongue darts out to soothe it. \u201cYou don't need to worry about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m gonna worry about you.\u201d Eddie wants to shake Steve, wants to scream into his face <i>Hey idiot, I\u2019m fucking in love with you and I hate seeing you hurt!</i> but he doesn\u2019t. He just continues to wipe at Steve\u2019s wounds. \u201cJust\u2026 Just promise me you'll come for help if you need it. I don't like the thought of you going through this \u2013 whatever this is \u2013 alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Steve,\u201d Eddie is still looking at him. He reaches out, rakes his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair, pushes back the locks that threaten to fall in his eyes. \u201cHey, where are your glasses?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve averts his eyes. \u201cI don't need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You just wear fake glasses every day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve shrugs. \u201cI like them. They hide my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie hums. \u201cNot good enough. I can still tell you\u2019re handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEw,\u201d Steve finally laughs, a sound Eddie has been desperate to hear. \u201cGo away. I need to shower and clean my ribs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need help?\u201d Eddie stands. Catches his reflection in the sink mirror and sees that he\u2019s fucking beaming. One laugh from Steve and he's got the sun shining out of his ass. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d Steve says, voice soft and sure, like he\u2019s already made up his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Eddie amends, pushing away the voice in his head telling him to pry. \u201cGoodnight, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Steve stands. Punches Eddie\u2019s arm awkwardly, \u201cThanks for being a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes sparkle. He turns away from Eddie to grab his favorite towel from the cabinet above the toilet. \u201cWe\u2019re roommates, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>It's so similar to what he told Spidey, that Eddie is immediately drawn back to the balcony. He wonders if the superhero came to visit him tonight. Wonders if he ever gets hurt as bad as Steve. Wonders if he should be more disappointed that he's in here with Steve instead of out there with a superhero. </p>\n<p>Eddie leaves the bathroom, stumbles to his bedroom in the dark, feeling a little punchdrunk himself. <i>Steve-drunk</i>, he thinks unhelpfully.</p>\n<p>It's his last thought before he goes back to sleep.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve is screwed.</p>\n<p>This would be a lot easier if Eddie was an asshole. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s the first roommate Steve has had that actually makes an effort to be his friend, and shit, he\u2019s really fucking cute.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s cute, and he\u2019s gay, and he talks to Spider-Man like he\u2019s not an enemy of the state but a childhood friend, and\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gave him your goober?\u201d Robin is sitting cross-legged on top of her counter, facing a sink full of bleach and dish soap as she tries to get a blood stain out of her white hood. (Steve warned her to pick a darker color for her suit, he really did. \u201cWell then the name Ghost-Spider wouldn't make sense, dingus,\u201d she consistently reminded him.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve shrugs. He\u2019s on the other side of Robin\u2019s bigass kitchen sink, scrubbing at his own sullied suit. \u201cI dunno, he works such late shifts, and I already had to save him once, so forgive a guy if he wants to prevent that from happening in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin glares at Steve. Their twin cop radios buzz with idle chatter from their perch on the windowsill above the sink. If Steve looks away, towards the outside, he\u2019ll see a lovely park where people walk their dogs and take morning strolls. \u201cHow did you afford this place, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI literally just work a better paying job,\u201d Robin says. \u201cMaybe you should try it, you know? Instead of slinging over photoshop just to get a commission from Jameson every week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve likes working for Jameson because it leaves him free to do his spider work. But he knows it\u2019s time to start looking. If just so he doesn\u2019t have to keep writing up IOU\u2019s to everyone he knows. \u201cThe lab Dustin interns for is asking for biotech engineers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you mean what you actually went to school for?\u201d Robin taunts, not unkindly. She just worries about him. He shouldn\u2019t have to be living paycheck to paycheck while also saving the entire world every other weekend.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Steve waves her snark away. Some soapy water drips off of the sponge he\u2019s holding, down his arms, till it curves around his elbows and drips onto his jean-clad thigh. \u201cI\u2019ll send my resume in soon. Maybe I\u2019ll make enough money to come live with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where does that leave your boyfriend?\u201d Robin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend,\u201d Steve retorts. It feels juvenile just being in this argument. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. Told me he gets a new roommate like every year. I need to get away from him anyway. He\u2019s too nosey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be nosey too if the dude who pays half my rent kept showing up half-dead. I mean, did you even think of the poor man\u2019s security deposit, Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve has two texts waiting for him as he swings out of Robin\u2019s window. He really shouldn\u2019t text and swing, but there\u2019s no one to stop him, so he uses muscle memory and spidey sense to get him back to his home.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Messages (2)</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Eddie: bringing home takeout. don\u2019t worry about dinner</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Mom: Call me.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Steve sighs. He clicks his mom\u2019s contact and connects his Bluetooth to his suit. It\u2019s an upgrade he did for fun, but it comes in handy more often than not. Especially when he\u2019s too busy taking down local crime to answer his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteven.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d Here's the thing: Steve loves his parents. He\u2019d die for them, he thinks. Over and over again. They\u2019ve been his lifeline since he was young, back when they lived in that old house in Harlem. Working overtime so he could go to all his science camps; so he could<i> eat\u2026</i> Steve knows he owes them everything. </p>\n<p>But working \u2018round the clock meant leaving their son to fend for himself. To come home to a house, empty and cold (they could never afford heating.) And when they <i>were</i> home, they were stressed to hell, often fighting and arguing in the kitchen while Steve tried to finish his homework.</p>\n<p>He owes them because they kept him alive. Because they sacrificed so much to give him a good education. But there\u2019s a lot of hurt there: a heavy ache that shifts in his chest when he hears his mother\u2019s voice. Like he half-expects her to guilt him into coming home. Or to tell him that the money he wires them from his already-thin paycheck isn\u2019t enough. </p>\n<p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d He\u2019s good at controlling his breathing when he talks through the comm. The amount of people he\u2019s had a casual phone conversation with while pummeling bad guys is actually laughable. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour father got laid off,\u201d She says with a tired sigh. \u201cDo you think you could wire us some money? They\u2019re gonna shut our water off, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve drops onto his fire escape. He\u2019s glad Eddie isn\u2019t out here, because he needs to be alone for this conversation. \u201cUm. Yeah, I can get it to you tomorrow. But Mom, I\u2019m not making that much in the first place. I can\u2019t keep sending you guys\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just this once,\u201d she insists, as she always does. \u201cSteve, we\u2019re your <i>parents</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve sighs. That guilt is back. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll send the money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d his mom\u2019s voice sounds relieved. Steve wishes he could share the sentiment. \u201cI love you, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie is getting too used to sharing his fire escape with Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>This thought occurs to him as he folds one of Steve\u2019s many throw blankets in the seat of a second camping chair he brought out just for Spidey. He wants the dude to feel welcomed, wants him to stay as long as he wants, wants him to lose track of time.</p>\n<p>Secretly, Eddie wants to smoke with him. Wants to catch that mask rolled halfway up, get a peak of the mouth that always has a quip at the ready. Wants to see if he has stubble or scars or acne or something he can commit to his memory, because the dude is a fucking enigma, and everyone in New York is, but at least Eddie can put a face to all of <i>their</i> confusing behaviors. </p>\n<p>Spider-Man is a complete mystery.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you were some old pervert who uses his powers to go looking in people\u2019s windows, right?\u201d Eddie only asks because he\u2019s high. He\u2019s high and he\u2019s got Spider-Man sitting in his camping chair, facing him. </p>\n<p>Spidey\u2019s legs are stretched out in front of him, heels catching on the railing. Thigh muscles taut, visible underneath the spandex. </p>\n<p>Eddie takes a shaky breath. Looks away just as Spider-Man\u2019s eye lenses do that weird squinty thing they do when he\u2019s trying to emote something to Eddie. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have never even thought of that,\u201d he says, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re the perv, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckles around his joint. Doesn\u2019t say much else. His memory lapses into a few different Instagram reels he had seen that morning. \u201cSo those other spider people? Are you guys related? Or like, coworkers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey snorts. \u201cWe all have similar powers, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you all know each other? Like, underneath the masks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man hums. Tilts his masked head back like he\u2019s thinking. \u201cI know Ghosty. Dunno the little guy though. I mean, I\u2019ve worked with him, but I don\u2019t know who he is. He doesn\u2019t know who I am either, so it\u2019s fair game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he your protege? Because he calls himself Spider-Man, too. Except his suit is a lot cooler. All black and shit. I bet he scares more perps than you with your primary colors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only fabric I could find at short notice,\u201d the hero gripes, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to become famous, or I would\u2019ve picked a cooler color pallet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe gray,\u201d Eddie murmurs. \u201cBlack and red is already taken by the little dude. Spider-boy or whatever. Ghost-Spider has got the silver and the white and the purple, which is dope in its own snow princess sort of way. You look like a dork compared to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Spidey laughs. It\u2019s one of those laughs where his real voice seeps through, breaking past whatever technology alters it so nosey people like Eddie can\u2019t figure out his identity. As soon as the hero notices, he cuts his laugh short and looks away, like he\u2019s trying to hide himself. Which is dumb, because he\u2019s already covered head to toe.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 did the muscles come overnight or did you have to work for them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to be asking me questions all night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you answer them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got them overnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking sick, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve drops a tangerine shaped bath bomb on the floor of the bathroom, and everything goes to shit.</p>\n<p>Everything actually goes to shit when Steve gets accepted as a biotech engineer at Octavius Labs. While exciting \u2014 he gets access to tons of new tech, and is allowed to work in the lab after work hours, if he wants \u2014 it\u2019s part time, and he struggles with the whole spidey-gig on a schedule thing. </p>\n<p>Suddenly, the police department is pissed at him because he\u2019s passing more crimes to them (their job, but he digresses.) Suddenly, Jameson is accepting applications from student photographers who are just desperate enough to answer his every beck and call (something Steve can\u2019t do now that he keeps his phone off in the lab.) Suddenly, Steve is staying out later just to keep up his patrol hours. Suddenly, his parents are asking for more money, so he\u2019s not even getting the satisfaction of a paycheck before it\u2019s ripped away from him. Suddenly, he\u2019s sleeping even less than before, and all he wants right now is to take <i>one fucking bath</i> but he can\u2019t even do that right because\u2013</p>\n<p>The bath bomb crumbles as it hits the bathroom floor. Orange powder and green glitter hit his bare feet, and Steve is letting out a frustrated whimper before he can stop himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve?\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice comes from the living room.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018M fine!\u201d Steve yells. He winces at the shake in his voice. Sniffs. \u201cJus\u2013 Just dropped something.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door bumps Steve\u2019s back when it opens. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Eddie mumbles. \u201cSorry. You sounded like you were crying and I was scared you got hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve snorts. His voice is still watery but Eddie doesn\u2019t mention it again. \u201c\u2018Dropped my bath bomb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Eddie says. His hand curls around Steve\u2019s forearm. He tugs gently, just to get Steve\u2019s attention. \u201cWas it a special one?\u201d And fuck, his voice is soft and nonjudgmental, like it\u2019s normal for a man to cry over a bath bomb. Like Steve isn\u2019t losing his mind right in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d Steve\u2019s lip wobbles. \u201cI just wanted to take a bath, and now I have to clean this all up, and I don\u2019t have any other citrus scents, and I love the citrus scents, and I\u2019m so tired\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, c\u2019mon, Steve.\u201d Eddie hooks his chin over Steve\u2019s shoulder. Steve can see in the mirror that Eddie has his hands tucked behind his back, politely out of the way.</p>\n<p>The action is weighted, and he smells like pine \u2014 like Christmas, even though the holiday is months away. Steve thinks maybe Eddie can feel the way his bones shake. The way he flinches every time he breathes because his ribs are still sore from a bank robbery he stopped two nights ago. That guy had a mean kick.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll sweep it up,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a shower? You\u2019ve got some citrus scented shower fizzers, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve finds himself nodding. He wants to take a bath because he wants to lay down; feel warm. But a shower will be fine, too. Maybe he\u2019ll just sit down on the cold tile and turn the heat up to its max setting.</p>\n<p>He can feel Eddie watching him from his perch on his shoulders. Can feel his hot breath against his cheek. He\u2019s not sure Eddie\u2019s ever been this close to him before. There\u2019s something about the soothing lift of his chest as he leans against Steve. The way he can synchronize his breathing to Eddie\u2019s, and it actually calms him down a little bit. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll just take a quick shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake as long as you want,\u201d Eddie mumbles. He pulls back, rests his large palms on Steve\u2019s shoulders and squeezes. \u201cI\u2019ll sweep this up while you\u2019re in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve blanks. \u201cUm. While I\u2019m taking a shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Eddie raises his brows in that coy way of his, grinning. \u201cUnless you need to be <i>absolutely alone</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve coughs into his fist. Truthfully, feigning the need to masturbate might actually be less embarrassing than admitting he\u2019s prone to wearing spandex suits and getting beat up constantly. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve ducks behind the curtain and doesn\u2019t take off his clothes until he\u2019s sure Eddie has gone to get a broom. </p>\n<p>He looks down at his body beneath the spray of the water. These new bruises on his ribs are taking a little longer to heal than his wounds normally do, and he knows it\u2019s because of how stressed he is. Something about the spider venom and regulated cortisol levels and other shit Steve has barely even begun to figure out about himself. God knows there\u2019s only so many times he can sneak into a medical lab before his luck runs out. Maybe his new status at Octavius will grant him access to more testing equipment. He\u2019s still too new to ask for any favors.</p>\n<p>If the police force could just get their act together, he won\u2019t have to keep cleaning up their messes, and it might be easier to get some sleep in this godforsaken city.</p>\n<p>He washes himself and rinses quickly, suddenly excited with the idea of dragging his space heater as close to his bed as it can get before it becomes a fire hazard. He can\u2019t hear Eddie\u2019s humming anymore, so he grabs the towel he had previously slung over the rung and wraps it around his waist before stepping into the steamy \u2014 and now clean \u2014 bathroom.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just fitting his key in his bedroom lock when Eddie appears, as he always seems to when Steve wants to be alone, and his eyes zero in on the bruises splattered across Steve\u2019s otherwise pale skin. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d he looks up at Steve, eyes inquisitive, sharp. Almost like he\u2019s daring Steve to tell him the truth. \u201cI should see the other guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Guys</i>,\u201d Steve corrects with a dry laugh. He avoids Eddie\u2019s eyes, knowing he promised he\u2019d tell him next time something like this happened. But, honestly, this happens so often, he thinks it\u2019d be easier to just keep Eddie in the dark. \u201cUh, anyway, thanks for cleaning\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should sleep with me,\u201d Eddie interrupts. </p>\n<p>Steve crosses his arms over his chest, on the defense. He\u2019s always on the defense. \u201cUh, what?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot like sex.\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes drift across Steve\u2019s bare torso, and he blushes. \u201cI'm just\u2026 <i>God</i>, I worry about you, Steve. Are you sure no one is going to break in and try to hurt you? Like, are you safe to sleep alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Steve\u2019s shoulders sag. He wonders briefly how he would react if he were in Eddie\u2019s situation, rooming with someone who is quite possibly the dodgiest person he\u2019s ever met. Would he be this kind? </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tender, compassionate sort of gleam in Eddie\u2019s eyes that makes Steve feel naked somehow. Like Eddie can see past his skin and his ribcage, all the way to his heart, beating and bleeding from a wound that, as long as this city never sleeps, will never heal. </p>\n<p>\u201cWould it..?\u201d He sighs; looks away. He\u2019s not actually sure how to open himself up like this. He can\u2019t remember the last time he ever let himself be comforted, and the concept feels foreign in his mind \u2014 made for someone else but not for him. Never for him. Still, he pushes out the words, \u201cWould it make you feel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eddie breathes, and he\u2019s the complete opposite of Steve. He\u2019s open and honest, and he\u2019s smiling now, relieved for Steve\u2019s sake, of all things. There\u2019s a distinct ache in the back of Steve\u2019s mind as Eddie tells him to get dressed. To grab his blankets and meet him in his room. Eddie\u2019s room, because it\u2019s never been locked away from Steve\u2019s curious gaze. Eddie has never avoided questions or hesitated when it came to being a friend. </p>\n<p>It makes Steve feel like shit as he shuffles into his old flannel pants and a sweatshirt from Midtown High. He glances around his room and he wishes he could bring Eddie in here. Of course he does. If Eddie could see all of his monitors, all his experiments and his work desk\u2026 well, he\u2019d geek out in that way he does. All happy hands waving about, shuffling steps and quick breaths in between sentences so he doesn\u2019t miss his train (<i>trains</i>) of thought.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Steve wishes he could share this with Eddie.</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s room is just as chaotic as he is. Band posters taped over movie posters taped over removable wallpaper because Eddie is strict about that security deposit. Mesh black curtains over a small window seat. A bookshelf stuffed with so many books, Steve is sure Eddie couldn\u2019t physically get one out without toppling the entire foundation. His bed is a full-size mattress shoved into the corner on a box spring. About three different quilts layer the sheets, topped with one of those heavy, soft wolf-printed blankets they hang from the ceiling at pawn shops. </p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t know people actually bought them. </p>\n<p>He steps in, feels the shag carpet under his sock-clad feet. Their apartment doesn\u2019t really have much insulation, and as winter approaches, the two boys only add on to their layers in a desperate attempt to not wake up shivering in the middle of the night. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be at the lab by seven. Can I set my alarm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure can, sweetheart.\u201d Eddie isn\u2019t even looking at Steve. He\u2019s puttering around his room, folding back his blankets and clearing off his nightstand as best as he can. He doesn\u2019t even notice that his choice of nickname makes Steve shiver more than the cool breeze outside.</p>\n<p>Steve takes note of a novel overflowing with annotating tabs. He would bet anything that the book itself is full of Eddie\u2019s handwriting; of his little notes and quips that the story must\u2019ve provoked. He wants to steal it. Wants to study the pages and make his own notes and ask Eddie if they sound good. If Eddie thinks his opinions are worth reading.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can have the side furthest from the wall,\u201d Eddie says thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, so you don\u2019t have to climb over me when you have to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Steve climbs in gingerly, favoring his ribs, even though he knows they\u2019ll be good as new soon. Maybe even by tomorrow morning, if he can get good enough sleep.</p>\n<p>The room smells faintly of weed, even though Steve knows Eddie does the majority of his smoking outside. It doesn\u2019t stop the scent from lingering on Eddie\u2019s jackets \u2014 on the throw blankets he is always lugging outside.</p>\n<p>Steve briefly thinks about all of Eddie\u2019s talks with him as Spider-Man, and he wonders how Eddie hasn\u2019t put everything together yet. Wonders if Eddie would be angry if he found out. Or would he be disappointed? That it\u2019s just Steve, and not the handsome dreamboat every gossip column expects to be under the mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can practically hear your thoughts,\u201d Eddie whispers as he yanks his lamp chain. The room is enveloped in darkness, and Steve can hear every small movement Eddie makes as he climbs into the space beside Steve. He can hear every fiber of the blankets as they wrinkle and every dust particle in the air as they shift with the movement.</p>\n<p>Steve wishes he could turn it all off. \u201cSorry,\u201d he croaks. There\u2019s a sting in his chest. At the thought and the idea of Eddie finding out, of Eddie leaving, of Eddie hating him. It feels almost overwhelming; and it shouldn\u2019t. Eddie\u2019s presence shouldn\u2019t be so apparent to Steve \u2014 Steve shouldn\u2019t have gotten so attached so quickly. And yet here he is, in bed with the man, wondering if the world is ending or if it\u2019s just his own heart on the verge of breaking.</p>\n<p>Steve thinks he might be a little in love with Eddie Munson.</p>\n<p>He feels selfish for thinking it. As if he could ever be in a relationship. As if his own nemeses aren\u2019t chomping at the bit to find something \u2014 anything \u2014 that might be considered Spider-Man\u2019s weakness. There\u2019s no way Steve could ever act on his feelings. Not if he wants to keep Eddie safe. </p>\n<p>So he shoves that feeling into the back of his mind until he can hardly feel it anymore. Back to the place he puts all of the more painful thoughts \u2014 the faraway ideas of a normal life.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't have to be sorry,\u201d Eddie mumbles. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s spidey-sense gives him a slight advantage in the dark. It\u2019s not exactly bright, but he can still see almost everything as clear as he can in the day. Almost like he\u2019s just wearing sunglasses. Because of this, when he turns on his side, facing Eddie, he can see the man\u2019s face half buried in his own pillow. His brown curls curtaining those gaunt cheeks and briefly, just briefly, Steve thinks about making sure Eddie eats more. Wants to ask if he\u2019s getting enough nutrients. Eating all his vitamins and whatnot. The venom in his own veins allows him to get away with a lot of shit, including skipping meals when life is too stressful. He doesn\u2019t want any of his loved ones in the same habit. \u201cYou don\u2019t work tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie shakes his head, still pressed against the pillow. It\u2019s endearing, in the way a puppy wiping his face against a couch cushion might be endearing. \u201cI probably won\u2019t fall asleep for long. My schedule is sort of fucked. But I\u2019m gonna stay here while you sleep.\u201d He says it with confidence, like there\u2019s not even an option for Steve to argue.</p>\n<p>So he doesn\u2019t. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says around a breath he can't seem to swallow. It feels like there\u2019s a rock in his throat. A rock tied to his feet, his hands, weighing him down, down, down. Too heavy and weighted to lift a hand and touch Eddie\u2019s tangled curls. Too heavy to touch his lips that look inviting and soft against his green cotton pillowcase. \u201cFor worrying about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course, Stevie,\u201d Eddie slurs. Even though he said he would be staying up, he seems more tired than Steve. If that\u2019s even possible. He reaches out in the dark, and Steve braces himself for the contact, for the tattooed hand hovering in front of his arm to complete its journey. Only it doesn\u2019t. Eddie\u2019s face twists with something like anxious hesitation, and he pulls back.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s reflexes kick in before he can stop himself. Before he can rationalize that there\u2019s no way a normal human would notice what just happened. But it\u2019s too late, and Steve is grabbing Eddie\u2019s wrist, pulling it against his chest as if it\u2019s an anchor, or maybe, though juvenile, a toy bear to hold. \u201cI mean it. Sometimes I- I forget how to be a friend. How to have a friend. I\u2019m sorry for worrying you. I\u2019ll try to be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s eyes are black holes in the supernova of his room. Sucking Steve in, destroying everything else in their path. Nothing between them but cotton sheets and one huge secret that could detonate this entire thing (whatever it is) that\u2019s going on between them. He\u2019s got this lazy smile on his lips that makes Steve think maybe this is the safest place in the entire world. That no one could reach them here. \u201cGo to sleep, Stevie. Stop thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d <i>I can\u2019t,</i> Steve wants to say. He\u2019s in bed beside a beautiful boy and he can\u2019t stop thinking about all the hard edges of the world. The skyscrapers and the sidewalks and the taxi drivers and the smog. How Eddie bleeds New York City but remains softened, his throw blankets on the fire escape, his curly handwriting in books. How Steve might be anything but soft, all bruises and blood and broken bones. </p>\n<p>How the two of them don\u2019t really fit together at all. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s parents never visit unless Steve agrees to pay for gas and dinner. He does so because he misses them, and he wants to be around them. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like spider powers give one the ability to stand up to their parents. Even if Steve really wishes it did.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents are coming over,\u201d he tells Eddie, who was supposed to have a shift at the bar, but traded last minute with one of his coworkers, meaning he\u2019ll be here when the Harringtons arrive. \u201cYou can come eat dinner with us if you\u2019d like. The bill\u2019s on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even if it turns out to be a mess, Steve is secretly hoping Eddie agrees to come. If Eddie comes, his parents are less likely to bring up money. Steve desperately wants to stop talking about money.</p>\n<p>Eddie is shuffling around their small kitchen. He\u2019s been tinkering with things all day. Checking the faucets and the pipes and whatnot. From what Steve has gathered, Eddie\u2019s uncle is a bit of a handyman, so Eddie has what feels like a vast knowledge for fixing things. He does this every month; checks on things and calls the landlord immediately if there\u2019s something he can\u2019t fix.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s never been anything Eddie couldn\u2019t fix on his own.</p>\n<p>Eddie also likes greasing the cabinet and door hinges every so often. Steve is pretty sure this is just something Eddie does for fun, so he\u2019s never questioned it. Eddie uses an old washcloth to wipe the brown oil off of his hands. There\u2019s still some dark stain that remains. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all have dinner here? I can make a mean stir fry if you give me an hour or two to get everything from the market.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve hopes his relief isn\u2019t obvious. The last thing he wants is for Eddie to think Steve is needy. But Eddie cooking dinner will save him a good hundred or so dollars, and that alone feels like a ten pound weight has just been lifted off of his shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll get here around seven. Will that be enough time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie tips his head and gives Steve a crooked grin. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate my time management skills, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve wishes he weren\u2019t so pale, because he\u2019s pretty sure the heat flooding his ears is the warning that he\u2019s about to turn as pink as bubblegum, and he really doesn\u2019t want to blush just because of a nickname. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, then,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The giddiness of Halloween approaching overshadows the seasonal depression that\u2019s been pestering Eddie ever since the summer ended. He picks up a box of those Pillsbury cookies; the ones with the pumpkin designs. He\u2019s fully planning on never cooking them, and instead stuffing himself with dough as he watches horror movies into the late night.</p>\n<p>He sticks the box in the fridge, behind a six pack of beer, and plays his Halloween playlist on top volume while he prepares the stir fry for Steve and his parents.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the obvious \u2014 that this feels exactly like a date \u2014 Eddie has noticed an increase in pressure on Steve. His roommate is always a little high strung, a little stressed, but ever since his new job, the stress has seemed to increase. So if this is something Eddie can do for Steve, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019ll make the best damn meal these people have ever seen.</p>\n<p>Steve is stress-cleaning. This means he\u2019s getting out the fabric softener spray, the multi-surface cleaners, the toilet brush \u2014 the works. They both keep a pretty clean apartment, and Eddie is confident that Steve\u2019s parents would find their home cozy and clean if they ever paid a surprise visit, but he figures maybe Steve just needs something to do with his hands, so he leaves him to it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s flipping the stir fry in his wok. He knew this big-ass pan would come in handy one day, even if it does take up way too much cabinet space. Steve is behind him, setting the table as best as he can. He\u2019s holding two bottles of wine, seemingly trying to figure out which one to keep out.</p>\n<p>Eddie turns his playlist from his Halloween music to a playlist of classical piano. \u201cPick the Riesling.\u201d</p>\n<p>The doorbell rings. Steve jumps so suddenly he nearly drops the wine. \u201cShowtime,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Eddie hopes Steve\u2019s parents don\u2019t mind that he\u2019s not wearing anything special. Just a nice pair of jeans and a striped sweater to keep the chill off. Steve recently moved the space heater into the living room, but its warmth doesn\u2019t quite reach the kitchen. Eddie is already craving the time after dinner when they can sit on the couches and cozy up. </p>\n<p>Eddie plates the dinner, just because he needs something to do while Steve helps his parents take off their coats.</p>\n<p>They look like a sweet couple. A balding man with crooked glasses, and a woman with chocolate brown bangs. </p>\n<p>Steve slowly brings them into the kitchen, \u201cMom, Dad, this is Eddie, my roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie wipes his hands on a dish towel and before reaching out for a handshake. \u201cHi. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They make introductions. Steve\u2019s dad is sort of quiet, but his mom pulls Eddie in for a hug and even compliments his hair, so that\u2019s nice.</p>\n<p>Everything is nice, in fact, sitting at their little table with Steve and Eddie on one side and Steve\u2019s parents on the other. Steve\u2019s shoulders seem loose as he laughs at something his dad is saying. Steve\u2019s mom is pulling Eddie into the conversation at every opportunity, asking questions about his life and complimenting his ideas. It feels so much like a date that Eddie briefly lets himself imagine it. That this is Steve bringing him to meet the parents. That if this were an alternate universe, he might be able to reach over the table and hold Steve\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until the dinner is done, and Eddie is doing the dishes, that things seem to take a turn.</p>\n<p>Steve and his parents don\u2019t move to the living room. They stay in the kitchen, sipping wine and talking loud enough that Eddie can hear them over the sound of him stacking clean dishes. He\u2019s not eavesdropping, he\u2019s not. He can\u2019t be, because the three of them know he can hear them. They know that he\u2019s due to return to the table any minute, as soon as he can get this sticky sauce off of his wok. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour father got a new job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, really?\u201d Steve sounds elated in a way Eddie hasn\u2019t really heard before. He wonders how long Steve has been waiting for this news. He\u2019s reminded all too well that Steve keeps a lot of things from him. He hides the majority of his life \u2014 and his problems \u2014 in some well-secured box. And every time Eddie thinks he might be close enough to cracking that safe, to figuring out the combination, Steve switches up on him again. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now we can put his paychecks in a retirement fund, and use the money you\u2019re lending us for the bills. How wonderful is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie drops a fork in the sink. It clatters loudly. The conversation around the table doesn\u2019t stop, but Eddie struggles to keep scrubbing the dishes; struggles to stay out of this one.</p>\n<p>Is this why Steve has been so stressed lately? On top of his new job, and whatever mafia shit he gets up to, he\u2019s also been lending his parents what sounds like a significant portion of his paychecks, if they\u2019re using the money to pay their <i>bills</i>. And why are they acting like Steve is going to keep paying them after his father got a job? </p>\n<p>He\u2019s waiting for Steve to stick up for himself, but that moment never comes. Instead, Steve steers the conversation away, towards something softer like how they\u2019ll be spending Christmas this year. </p>\n<p>In less than ten minutes, Steve shows them out with practiced grace. He helps his mom into her coat and stands in the cold entryway of the apartment, waving them goodbye as they climb into their little Beemer.</p>\n<p>Eddie places the last of the dry dishes away and stands in the toasty living room, unsure how to breach the subject. Unsure if Steve even wants him to breach the subject. </p>\n<p>Turns out, it doesn\u2019t matter, because before Eddie can open his mouth, Steve is tugging on his shoes. \u201cI\u2019m going out. Don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Eddie reaches for Steve\u2019s arm, clasps his fingers around Steve\u2019s wrist before he can get away. \u201cWait, talk to me, Steve. I can help you. I don\u2019t want you going out so late. You might get hurt again and\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Steve says, eyes flashing. He looks almost scary like this, all terse and glaring, like fire personified, like a pot of boiling water ready to bubble over. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slams the door. Someone from the apartment above them stomps a few times in a warning. Eddie is frustrated, so he grabs their broom and taps the ceiling. The nonverbal argument goes on for a little while longer until Eddie decides he\u2019s had enough.</p>\n<p>He goes into his room and fishes the earpiece from his nightstand drawer. <i>The doohickey</i>. He shoves it in his ear and presses the button.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s Eddie,\u201d he rushes out, pushing open his window and climbing out onto the fire escape. \u201cMy roommate- Steve- I need you to track him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Spider-Man\u2019s voice sounds taut too. Eddie wonders if the entire world is mad at him today. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re friends?\u201d Eddie ventures. \u201cLook, he just left the apartment about ten minutes ago. I need you to follow him and make sure he doesn\u2019t get hurt. He\u2019s been getting into fights or something lately and I\u2019m scared he went out looking for one tonight, and I just need you to do this one thing for me and I promise I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence on the other end, save the soft breath of the superhero and the drift of air that makes Eddie think he\u2019s swinging. Maybe he\u2019s already on his way to finding Steve. \u201cI\u2019m coming over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, I don\u2019t need you to come over. I need you to check on Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about Steve,\u201d Spider-Man says through the comm, and it bites Eddie with a venom. The next words soothe the wound, \u201cI care about you. I\u2019m coming to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Eddie rips the earpiece out and throws it off of the fire escape, waiting for the satisfying crack of it hitting the pavement below. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe he thought this night would go well. That he might actually be getting somewhere with Steve. And he can\u2019t believe that Spider-Man won\u2019t just listen to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude! That goober was not cheap!\u201d Spider-Man drops onto the fire escape. He seems to recognize that Eddie does not want him there, because he keeps his distance, choosing to sit on the stairwell instead of his usual seat. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was called a doohickey,\u201d Eddie grumbles. He wishes he had a cigarette, if just to keep his hands busy.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoober, doohickey, thingamabob, do-dad,\u201d Spidey shrugs. \u201cWhatever feels right at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie nods. Doesn\u2019t want to give Spidey the satisfaction of laughing at a joke right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s at a bar down the road,\u201d Spidey says quietly. \u201cI saw him going in as I was swinging over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie breathes a sigh of relief. He hates the idea of Steve going to drink by himself, but it beats fighting someone in an alley somewhere, or whatever it is he gets up to. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s all I wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you..?\u201d Spidey clears his throat. \u201cI mean, you seem to like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Eddie <i>really</i> wishes he had a cigarette. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey is silent, and then, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend. Good friends don\u2019t scare their friends the way he scared you. Eddie, your voice on the comm, it\u2013 <i>Fuck, </i>I hate the way he makes you feel, if that\u2019s how you react. I don\u2019t want to ever hear your voice in that much pain again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Part of Eddie wants to defend Steve with every fiber of his being, but another part of him wants to drown in Spider-Man\u2019s words. But Spider-Man doesn\u2019t know Eddie, and Eddie doesn\u2019t know Steve, and life is really hard to navigate when people lock themselves behind closed doors. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be fine,\u201d he settles on. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d Spidey interrupts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey clasps his hands over his heart and drones, \u201cWow. You sure know how to flatter a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie shrugs. He\u2019s not up for joking today. </p>\n<p>Spider-Man stands up. He is just as tall as Eddie, and when he leans in, his eye lenses whirring, Eddie feels overwhelmed by the way he smells of nylon and smoke, like he\u2019s just swung through a haze of pollution.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get a little crinkle between your eyebrows when you\u2019re upset,\u201d he says, voice still warped by that god awful mechanism. He reaches up, touches one gloved thumb to Eddie\u2019s forehead, smoothes out the wrinkle. \u201cThere,\u201d and if Eddie closes his eyes, he can pretend that the voice is Steve\u2019s. That Steve could ever care enough about him to notice something as trivial as a furrowed brow, \u201cHandsome again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie feels a little dazed. Like his body is running a few minutes ahead and his mind can\u2019t keep up. Suddenly, he\u2019s watching his hands move up on their own accord. He\u2019s watching his fingers grasp the seam of the mask at the base of Spider-Man\u2019s neck. He\u2019s watching himself pull Spider-Man\u2019s mask up, until he\u2019s seeing his Adam\u2019s apple, his chin, his lips, his Cupid\u2019s bow, his\u2013</p>\n<p>Spider-Man grabs his wrist, shakes his head, and Eddie knows this is all he\u2019s allowed to see.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s enough. Because suddenly he\u2019s finding answers to all the buzzing questions in his head. Like, Spider-Man has a square jaw, and Spider-Man has scattered freckles and acne scars and chapped lips like he\u2019s been biting them under his mask, and Eddie is thinking he wants to kiss him, so he does.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man tastes faintly of white wine, and Eddie imagines his own mouth must taste the same way. He\u2019s got his hands on Spidey\u2019s neck, tugging him close, breathing him in, short puffs of air escaping their lips whenever he moves his head.</p>\n<p>Big, warm hands settle on Eddie\u2019s waist. Pull him up against his body, so that Eddie can feel everything that thin suit fails to hide. His heart is beating in his ears and he\u2019s kissing Spidey like this might be his only chance to \u2014 like he needs to make this one count.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man moans, and Eddie, in shock, steps back. Because the voice mechanism is gone, and Spider-Man sounds really fucking pretty. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers, voice raspy and low. It sounds familiar, but Eddie is a little wine-drunk, and he doesn\u2019t feel like doing detective work right now. He just feels like kissing Spider-Man again.</p>\n<p>So he does. Over and over and over, until the ache in his chest feels more like hope.</p>\n<p>Steve is playing with fire.</p>\n<p>He knew it from the moment he let Eddie lift his mask. Even just a little bit. Then he went and let Eddie kiss him \u2014 went and kissed Eddie back.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the most selfish thing he\u2019s ever done, and the worst part is, he\u2019d do it in a heartbeat if he ever got the chance again. He feels gross for thinking so \u2014 for knowing that the only way he\u2019d ever get Eddie to kiss him is if Eddie doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s him.</p>\n<p>He hates himself for it, the same way he hates himself for worrying Eddie so much the previous night. He meant every venomous word he said to Eddie, that he thinks he\u2019s a terrible friend, and that Eddie deserves better, and that he never should\u2019ve scared Eddie like that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all too confusing \u2014 where Steve ends and Spider-Man begins. </p>\n<p>He supposes the only common ground between the two is Eddie, and if he doesn't fix it, that will be ruined too.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let his relationship with Eddie \u2014 however frail it may be \u2014 be ruined.</p>\n<p>So he gets Eddie\u2019s favorite pastry from this Italian bakery a few blocks over and then writes a note in his horrible blocky handwriting.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Eddie,</i><br>\n<i>I\u2019m really sorry for how things went down yesterday. I know you were only trying to help. I have to go to work, but meet me at this address @ 7. There\u2019s something really beautiful I want to show you.</i><br>\n<i>Love,</i><br>\n<i>Steve.</i>\n</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s off to work, except it\u2019s not work at Oscorp. He\u2019s actually got a day off from the lab this week. This type of work happens at an abandoned warehouse in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, where he and Robin often practice their fighting. </p>\n<p>Robin is waiting for him, alongside a tall boy who introduces himself as Lucas. Lucas Sinclair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d Steve cocks his head to the side. \u201cThe second one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucas has the audacity to look bashful. He scratches the back of his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what name to use. And the real Spidey is hardly ever around Queens, so I thought it\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can brainstorm new names for you,\u201d Steve decides, because he really doesn\u2019t like sharing his name with someone else. Identity theft is not a joke. </p>\n<p>Lucas looks delighted at the idea. \u201cSo you know him? The real Spidey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin snorts, indignant. \u201cYou weren\u2019t this excited when you found out about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Lucas is muttering. He scratches at the inside of his wrist, and Steve can see \u2014 using spidey sense \u2014 a raised mark, like a scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucas lifts his hand with a confused sort of look on his face, like Steve should know. \u201cMy web shooter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>embedded</i> in your skin?\u201d Steve feels a little nauseous, and then the feeling passes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sticky, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can stick to things,\u201d Lucas supplies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely can\u2019t do that!\u201d Robin jumps up, claps her hands together. \u201cLucas, you\u2019re like the new and improved Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on now\u2013\u201d Steve is starting, just as Lucas interrupts with: \u201c<i>Steve is Spider-Man?!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Robin orders Chinese takeout (it\u2019s the only place nearby that will deliver to an abandoned warehouse, they\u2019ve come to find out) and the three of them sit on the gym mats Steve stole from his high school years back, talking and learning and questioning things about each other.</p>\n<p>The timeline is rough, but from what Steve can gather, he is the first known spider-person. He's had his powers ever since that field trip to Mayor Osborn\u2019s all too exclusive lab, where one rogue, hybrid spider bit the back of Steve\u2019s neck and then promptly died.</p>\n<p>Robin didn\u2019t get bit so much as injected, four years after Steve, having been kidnapped by a scientist, Curtis Connors, who had been doing experiments on people. She had been injected in the muscle of her thigh, about an hour earlier than Steve\u2019s rescue mission, and the two of them have been figuring it out together ever since.</p>\n<p>Lucas, having just recently gotten bit, has the most chaotic story. Nothing but a hybrid spider and him meeting up at the wrong place (the subway tunnels Lucas apparently graffities in his spare time), wrong time (the exact night another ill-intentioned scientist had decided to let a batch of his own hybrid insects loose in the New York sewer.) Steve actually remembers that night, because cleanup was a bitch, and he\u2019s never worked with so many grumpy sanitation managers, who, on top of swimming in literal shit, had to shift through and extract the missing insects. They did, in the end. Lucas is the only (known) collateral damage from that night.</p>\n<p>Eventually, once all the chow mein is gone and they\u2019ve compared their individual powers, they realize the placement of the bite has a lot to do with which abilities are more prominent. </p>\n<p>Steve, bitten close to his cerebellum, has spidey sense up the wazoo. He can see in the dark, sense the movement of dust or static in the air, and his reflexes are everything to brag about. </p>\n<p>Robin, injected in the leg, can carry ten tons, no contest. She\u2019s actually lifted a semi truck off of a bridge before. It\u2019s all in the muscle, in the dexterity and the way she moves. Which is alarming, because she\u2019s all knobby-knees and awkward bumbling outside of the suit.</p>\n<p>Lucas\u2019 natural web shooters and setules make a lot more sense once they figure out he was bitten on the hand. He shares unfortunate anecdotes from when he had just gotten his powers, and how he stuck to his locker at school, and how his basketball felt literally glued to his hand during practice.</p>\n<p>Their similarities and differences settle over Steve in a way that\u2019s unfamiliar, yet welcome. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice to know that other people understand. </p>\n<p>They go over their suits, and their tech (while all of them can sew decently, Steve is the only one who knows how to hook up all the mechanisms. Lucas promises he'll join robotics and pay extra attention in chemistry.) Steve has them each make a list of things they need in their arsenal, and they even make a patrol schedule, one that takes a lot of the pressure off of Steve and delegates it to his two friends \u2014 partners, more like.</p>\n<p>It turns out, people are willing to help if he just has the courage to reach out and ask for it.</p>\n<p>They practice fighting, brawling, how to get out of handcuffs, web attacks, and all sorts of things Steve once taught Robin. Now they teach Lucas, together. And when Lucas lands a kick against Steve\u2019s shoulder, where he knows it\u2019s gonna hurt in the morning, he\u2019s more excited that Lucas got the move down. He wraps him in a hug, tells him he\u2019s proud, and pretends he can\u2019t feel how hard the little guy is squeezing him back.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>As he does every time he has a gay crisis, Eddie calls Chrissy.</p>\n<p>He waits until six o\u2019clock to call her. Sure that she\u2019s the only person who can keep him from chickening out of this <i>date</i> or whatever-the-fuck Steve has planned for them. He\u2019s half-convinced Steve might finally introduce him to his mafia buddies, but Chrissy reminds him that they didn\u2019t even fight, really, Steve just left when Eddie wanted him to stay.</p>\n<p>Eddie sighs. He\u2019s smoking on his fire escape again, holding his phone to his face. \u201cYou\u2019re always the voice of reason, Chris.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Chrissy says. \u201cNow, what happened last night? After Steve left? Did he ever come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Eddie rubs the space between his brows. \u201cOnce Spidey came over, I was a little focused on kissing him and\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, rewind!\u201d Chrissy practically shrieks through the phone. \u201cYou kissed Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie can still feel the man\u2019s jaw in the palm of his hands, pliant and sweet and nothing like the smart aleck that often greets Eddie on his fire escape. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he groans. \u201cI was sad, and he came to check on me, and it just kind of happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fucking water signs are useless,\u201d Chrissy gripes. \u201cJust so you know, this would <i>never</i> happen to a virgo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m deleting Co-Star next time I get your phone,\u201d Eddie says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just redownload it,\u201d Chrissy retorts. \u201cAnyways, you kissed New York\u2019s most eligible superhero after an anticlimactic fight with the man you\u2019re helplessly in love with \u2014 how is this not a water sign problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a scorpio,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cIsn\u2019t this more of a pisces predicament?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an Eddie predicament,\u201d Chrissy decides after a break of silence. Eddie hears the faint hiss of her sucking on her vape. She never refills it when it\u2019s out, she just waits a few weeks and pretends there\u2019s still enough juice in there to fulfill her addiction. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t blame all the water signs for your unfortunate life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d Chrissy chirps. \u201cNow, you should get going. Don\u2019t want to keep your Prince Charming waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie sighs. \u201cYeah. Guess I can\u2019t avoid it any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck. Let me know how it goes as soon as you get back. Unless he actually <i>is</i> part of the Italian mafia and is bringing you in to trade for hard drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey trade <i>people</i> for that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor cocaine? Probably not. Ketamine? You might be in trouble, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie hangs up on her. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eight years of lying, and it never gets any easier. </p>\n<p>Steve is standing on the sidewalk, having bummed a cigarette from a girl wearing a beret \u2014 an actual fucking beret. She disappears around the bend before he can light it, and after his first puff, he realizes she gave him a cherry-flavored cigarette. Where she got them, Steve has no idea. </p>\n<p>When Eddie arrives, he looks soft. There\u2019s no better word for it \u2014 for the faded band t-shirt paired under a denim jacket, the black jeans a little looser than his usual pair, and worn gray sneakers, scuffed from rainy quad days and stained from whatever parties Eddie used to go to in his youth. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s spidey sense gives him the ability to see every conditioned curl on Eddie\u2019s head, every sunspot on his nose, every shadow of stubble on his jaw. Stubble that scratched him less than twenty-four hours ago. The thought makes Steve feel flushed, unable to look Eddie in the eye, even though it was him who invited him here. It\u2019s Steve who is supposed to be apologizing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you taking me, Stevie?\u201d Eddie has an easygoing grin, as crooked and boyish as a nursery rhyme. Steve could read him over and over and over and he\u2019d probably never get bored.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe roof,\u201d he replies, as soon as his brain catches up to him. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leads Eddie \u2014 who is more silent than usual \u2014 past heavy double doors that should be locked at this time of night, except Steve snuck in here earlier as Spidey and worked all the locks open. He also deactivated all nearby security cameras. Not because he thinks anything is going to happen, but because he needs to stay vigilant, needs to cover his bases if he wants to protect Eddie and himself. If they find out his secret identity, everything<i> will </i>go to shit.</p>\n<p>They climb up concrete stairs, their steps echoing and echoing, a not-so-silent reminder that the last time they spoke was terse and strained.</p>\n<p>Steve stops at the top floor, pushes open the door, and presents the rooftop to Eddie with a flourish of his arm. \u201cTa-da!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie shuffles past him, squinting at the dim sunlight. He smells like cinnamon. Like one of those little brooms people hang on their doorknobs. \u201cA roof?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve lets the door close behind them with a soft <i>click</i>. He reaches out, grabs the rough denim of Eddie\u2019s elbow, and pulls him in the other direction, where he previously laid a tablecloth out on the cold roof. He hasn\u2019t been sure what food would make this less awkward, considering that it very much resembles a date, so he settled on one of those premade fruit platters from the grocery store, and a bottle of sparkling cider, because he doesn\u2019t think either of them make very good decisions when drunk. \u201cThis is one of my favorite spots,\u201d he explains as Eddie sits, eyes immediately drawn to the purple grapes. \u201cI thought you should see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie pops a grape in his mouth just as Steve sits. His wolfish eyes watch Steve with measured hesitance, blinking slowly. \u201cYou wanted to show me the rooftop of an insurance office?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sunset,\u201d Steve supplies. He\u2019s starting to feel like maybe this <i>is </i>a date. A middle school date, far too awkward for two men who have known each other for nearly two years now. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice view from up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie smiles, his sharp grin on full display. Steve wishes he were Spider-Man right now, if just so he could lean over and kiss him. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he reaches for the bottle of cider, opens the cork and sets to pouring two cups to keep himself busy, \u201cI thought I should apologize for the way I left everything last night. You were just trying to be a good friend, and I was rude when I shouldn\u2019t have been. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie is silent for a moment. He grabs another grape and rolls it between his fingers. \u201cI get it, man. Parents are tough. Money is tough. Both? I\u2019m not surprised you ran out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s so forgiving it makes Steve want to scream. He wishes he could explain to Eddie just how bad of a friend he is. How he\u2019s awful and secretive and his very existence threatens them both. How Eddie deserves someone who can kiss him freely, not behind a mask. </p>\n<p>He decides to shift the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m visiting my parents tomorrow. Gonna tell them I can\u2019t pay them anymore. Gotta cut them off. At least back to what I was paying them before my dad lost his job. They probably won\u2019t get too mad at me, but I might actually die from the proximity of all that financial stress under one roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Eddie mumbles. \u201cLet me know if you want me to come with, \u2018kay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolls his eyes to quench the distant need to swoon. \u201cYour second time tagging along with your roommate and his parents in one week?\u201d He teases, \u201cI think you need to get laid, Eddie Munson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something flashes in Eddie\u2019s eyes briefly. Hurt, maybe, although that doesn\u2019t make any sense, because Steve is just teasing him. And then, his face morphs into a smile, a little too wide and a little too long. \u201cI fear I am not the fuck \u2018em and leave \u2018em type, Steve Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Steve swallows around nothing. There\u2019s an earnest look in Eddie\u2019s eyes, begging him to understand something. But spidey sense doesn\u2019t read minds, and Steve is hardly an empath, so he just sits there, staring at Eddie for what is probably way too long.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eddie takes a nervous sip of his cider and squints at the horizon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take me for the commitment type?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is silent long enough for Eddie to turn his head, patiently awaiting his answer. But Steve is struggling to find the words, because he\u2019s thinking about Eddie cleaning his bathroom so Steve wouldn't have a meltdown and Eddie folding his sheets back for Steve to crawl into and Eddie cooking dinner for Steve\u2019s parents without complaint. And suddenly nothing but commitment fits the guy, and Steve is struggling to convey the way that makes him feel. How it hurts a little more than picturing Eddie with one night stands. How he thinks if he has to see Eddie with a long term partner one day, he might actually die. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t,\u201d he finally pushes out.</p>\n<p>The sunset doesn\u2019t disappoint, it\u2019s orange hues casting a glow over Eddie\u2019s pale skin. Once the fruit is long gone, and the cider has all been drunk, Steve is thinking about packing everything up when Eddie suddenly speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how <i>did</i> you find this place? Spidey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve whips his head so fast he nearly loses his balance, despite the fact that he\u2019s sitting. He tries to school his expression, but it\u2019s hard, because he\u2019s so used to having a fucking mask to do that for him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie looks unperturbed. \u201cYour photos of Spidey? Is this one of the spots you take them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve laughs, soft and relieved. \u201cOh, yeah. He uh\u2013 likes heights.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie snorts. The wind blows.</p>\n<p>Everything is okay again.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Halloween comes, and it\u2019s the first holiday where all of Eddie\u2019s friends and all of Steve\u2019s friends are gathered under the same roof. All wearing their costumes, they squish themselves into Steve and Eddie\u2019s two-bedroom, drinking themselves silly while some horror movie plays on their small television.</p>\n<p>Steve baked Eddie\u2019s cookie dough the other day \u2014 damn him \u2014 and everyone is sharing spiked cider and hot chocolate while they wait for Robin and Steve to bring home the pizza. Jonathan, Steve\u2019s old coworker from The Bugle, brings enough weed brownies to green everyone out, so Eddie stuffs half of them in a ziploc bag and hides them from the guests before he has to entertain about a dozen different midlife crises in his own home.</p>\n<p>Jonathan brings Nancy Wheeler, and she and Eddie get to talking about what life is like in The Big Apple. Apparently, Nancy is a journalist for The Bugle, but she\u2019s hoping to move over to New York Times, or become a traveling journalist so she can write about events happening all over the world. Tabloids are just a stepping stone, she\u2019s telling him, and there\u2019s black glitter around her eyes, and little pointed ears on her head. </p>\n<p>She\u2019s so small she fits on one cushion of Eddie and Steve\u2019s couch, and Eddie realizes that she folds into herself the same way Chrissy does. <i>Did</i>, before she moved out of her parent\u2019s house and started making her own decisions. He wonders what plagues Nancy, or if he\u2019s had too many brownies already and is reading into everything.</p>\n<p>Chrissy is sitting on their counter, he can see her from the couch, wearing a glittery blue mini dress, white go-go boots, and fairy wings. Her strawberry blond curls are left down, loose over her shoulders, and she\u2019s talking to Dustin as she stirs the crockpot full of cider she brought. </p>\n<p>Dustin is in a Han Solo costume, drinking a can of beer with a proud smile on his face, like he knows he\u2019s underage but is cheeked he got away with drinking in a supervised setting anyway. It\u2019s endearing, and the innocence of it reminds Eddie of Steve, who often has the face of someone who got caught with his hand in a cookie jar. Who often looks abnormally proud when he manages to come up a good excuse \u2014 when Eddie decides to accept it as truth. </p>\n<p>Steve invited another friend, a freshman from Empire State University named Lucas. He brought his friend, Max. They\u2019re wearing couple costumes \u2014 Noah and Allie from The Notebook \u2014 but their body language says they\u2019re definitely not a couple yet. Eddie wonders how two people can be so oblivious to each other that they wear literal couples costumes and still aren\u2019t together. </p>\n<p>Heather hasn\u2019t shown. Eddie thinks sometime during the night when they\u2019re both a little too drunk and tired, he\u2019ll ask Chrissy about it, but for now he\u2019s content to stay seated, breathing in the faint scent of apple cider and booze.</p>\n<p>Robin finally arrives, and she\u2019s wearing a yellow plaid outfit reminiscent of Clueless\u2019 Cher. She's lugging five boxes of pizza, kicking open the half-ajar door with combat boots and yelling out an exasperated <i>\u201cHelp, please!\u201d</i> before Eddie rushes over and releases her of her duties. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Steve?\u201d Eddie barely sets the boxes down on the counter before all of the guests are reaching for a slice. </p>\n<p>Robin rolls her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s sneaking in through the fire escape. The Dingus forgot a costume and now has to scrounge for something or, as he said, Dustin will never forgive him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie makes sure there are enough paper plates for everyone before he disappears down the hall, into his room. As Robin said, Steve\u2019s on the fire escape, headed for his own bedroom window.</p>\n<p>Eddie lifts his window and peaks out. \u201cHey! I have some extra costumes if you need one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d Steve exclaims, his shoulders dropping in relief. He\u2019s wearing scrubs, which is funny, because he\u2019s not a doctor, but Eddie figures the <i>bio</i> in <i>bio</i>tech engineer explains the garb. Why Steve couldn't just go as a doctor is beyond him, but Eddie can appreciate the need for a costume that isn't just a work uniform. </p>\n<p>Steve climbs into Eddie\u2019s room. He smells like bleach and rubbing alcohol. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to get one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c'Work been crazy?\u201d Eddie asks casually, straying away from the question he really wants to ask, which is <i>Why do you keep sneaking out at night when you think I\u2019m asleep? Your window is right beside mine, do you think I can\u2019t hear you? It can't be for the lab. The lab isn't open at night.</i></p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s been extra secretive lately. Paranoid, almost, and jumpy too. Eddie doesn\u2019t want to think he\u2019s losing progress with Steve, but it sure feels like it when Steve takes more hours at the lab or avoids Eddie\u2019s gaze when he comes home with injuries he can\u2019t explain away.</p>\n<p>Something else just as frustrating is that Spider-Man hasn\u2019t returned to the fire escape since their kiss. Eddie has half a mind to believe that he\u2019s successfully scared the superhero away, which is just great. And he stupidly threw the doohickey off of the escape, so he can\u2019t even call Spider-Man and ask if they can forget it all happened and just go back to being friends.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Eddie manages to fuck everything up without even trying. Just one of his many talents. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have a lot of stuff from my old renn faire days,\u201d he says, opening his small closet. He pulls a storage container from the top and sets it on his bed. \u201cThey should fit you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smiles, something so soft Eddie probably shouldn\u2019t have noticed it, but it\u2019s Steve, so of course he does. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Jus\u2019 funny to think about younger Eddie at a renn faire,\u201d Steve sifts through the folded clothes, pulling out a black puffy shirt Eddie\u2019s pretty sure he used for Zorro costume in high school one year. \u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZorro?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I thought it was Wesley from The Princess Bride.\u201d Steve frowns at the shirt. He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell everyone I\u2019m Wesley. Got any black bandanas?\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Steve is going as Eddie\u2019s gay awakening. Fuck him. </p>\n<p>Eddie gets him a bandana anyways, lets Steve cut two holes in it to make the mask. He folds his fake glasses and sets them on Eddie\u2019s nightstand, like maybe they belong there. He digs through Eddie drawers until he finds black pants, and he doesn\u2019t even ask Eddie if he can wear them, he just does.</p>\n<p>Steve Harrington may very well be Eddie\u2019s worst enemy. Because now, all dressed up, he\u2019s smirking at Eddie, floppy brown hair falling over his eyes. Throwing his arms out and cocking his head to the side, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie feels his heart race. <i>Ravishing</i>, he wants to say. He clears his throat. \u201cLike we\u2019re going to miss out on pizza if we stay in here any longer. Let's go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Steve cheeks.</p>\n<p>Eddie sighs. It\u2019s gonna be a long night.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve is slumped against the sofa, against Robin\u2019s knobby knees, nursing a cup of cider. He\u2019s two brownies in, and the room feels a little warm, a little soft, a little loved.</p>\n<p>Eddie is on the loveseat diagonal to him, holding a sleepy Chrissy in his lap. Everyone is more or less squished together, ignoring the television (playing old Goosebumps reruns now) in favor of discussing their costumes. Steve is trying to focus on the show, but he can\u2019t. </p>\n<p>Eddie is wearing a white dress shirt and a grey and black striped tie. At least three different times, he\u2019s been asked which Hogwarts house he\u2019s representing, and he\u2019s replied to each question with growing vigor, that he's <i> actually the only male student of Cackles Academy, which came before Hogwarts thank you very much</i>. And somehow Steve knows exactly what Eddie is talking about; all of their drunken nights watching Netflix shows, and Eddie has fixated on the one about british witches. He\u2019s explaining to Robin how it passes the Bechdel test with flying colors, and Steve is watching him. </p>\n<p>Eddie, with his curly hair pulled back into Dutch braids, his wild and manic eyes red rimmed from the weed. His neck is flushed, a pretty pink across his pale skin that only grows as he continues to explain his favorite show, easily forgetting to breathe in that way he does when he\u2019s excited. It\u2019s addicting: Eddie\u2019s happiness. Steve is lost in the image. </p>\n<p>Briefly, he registers someone asking him a question, and he feels like he\u2019s swimming in jello, or heavy goop, because it takes him way too long to turn his head and understand that Jonathan is talking to him. \u201cSorry. What?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jonathan chuckles, \u201cI said, Jameson misses you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Steve actually laughs at this, because he knows Jameson couldn\u2019t wait for him to quit.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious,\u201d Jonathan looks at Nancy for support, and she nods. \u201cNone of the new photographers are getting good pictures of Spider-Man. We\u2019ve watched him use your old spreads as examples during three different firings. So\u2026 you know\u2026 you could always send the pics by email and make extra money, since it was a commission job anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Steve is actually pondering it. He never pays attention to The Daily Bugle and what they write about him, he\u2019s always just collected his check and went on his way. \u201cI dunno. I\u2019m so busy nowadays.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chatter of the room has sort of faded now, and everyone is idly listening to Steve and Jonathan chat about Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>Chrissy, eyes closed, stays curled up in Eddie\u2019s lap like a big cat. His grand gestures and loud explanations hardly moved her at all. \u201cHis pictures of Spidey are godlike.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jonathan looks back at Steve, like Chrissy\u2019s approval is all he needs to get back on the team. \u201cHow did you even manage to make the deal with Spidey? Like, how come he trusts you well enough to pose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve feels hot under the collar. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just met him and asked. I don\u2019t bother him and he doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably has a crush on you,\u201d Nancy says, pondering.</p>\n<p>Dustin snorts into his cup, spilling hot chocolate on his stark white shirt. \u201cSorry!\u201d He squeaks when everyone looks at him. \u201cJust\u2026 Why would Spider-Man have a crush on <i>Steve</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is well aware that three other people in this room know that Spider-Man and Steve are the same person. Still, the question is funny enough for those out of the know, who start to speculate Spider-Man\u2019s love life.</p>\n<p>Without meaning to, Steve glances at Eddie. </p>\n<p>He knows he needs to stop being a wimp and just suit up, man up, and meet Eddie on the fire escape. Make sure Eddie knows he didn\u2019t do anything wrong \u2014 that Spider-Man likes him very much and definitely doesn\u2019t have a crush on that weird Bugle photographer.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s scared. Scared of falling deeper than he already has. Eddie is addictive, and Steve doesn\u2019t know if he should run far away or embrace these feelings taking over. He doesn\u2019t want Eddie to get hurt for being connected to Spider-Man. He also isn\u2019t confident Eddie will keep his feelings once Steve reveals himself.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s brave enough to find out.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the fifth of November when Steve finally meets Eddie on the fire escape. </p>\n<p>Just Steve, not Spider-Man. He climbs through his window, shivers at the change in the air. It\u2019ll start snowing any day now, and he hopes Eddie\u2019s little habit of staying out here for hours will fade.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s looking soft again, and Steve is beginning to think this is just the way Eddie looks now. Bundled and cozy, huggable, the type of soft that makes him want to bury his face in Eddie\u2019s cotton-covered chest. He can\u2019t. He knows this. But he wants to. </p>\n<p>Eddie in his pajamas, Eddie on his camping chair, Eddie with his hood pulled over his head because it\u2019s way too cold to leave his ears open to the elements. He\u2019s nursing a cigarette, and to Steve, the orange glow of the cherry looks a little bit like gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I sit with you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie startles, like he really hadn\u2019t noticed Steve, and then nods without turning his head. \u201cAll yours,\u201d he gestured to the empty chair beside him. The one Steve usually occupies when he\u2019s covered in spandex. </p>\n<p>He grabs the fluffy blanket Eddie has folded on the seat of the chair and wraps it around his shoulders before he sits. \u201cYou gotta stop coming out here, man. You\u2019re gonna catch a cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie says softly. \u201cI\u2019m just being stubborn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather be stubborn in the heat of our apartment?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean the heat of our space heater that only reaches about ten feet before you\u2019re plunged into the cold again?\u201d Eddie smiles, grim. \u201cI\u2019m good out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get a second one,\u201d Steve presses. He\u2019s desperate for conversation. For proof that Eddie would entertain him, <i>Steve</i>, on this rooftop in the same effortless way he entertains Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>But right now, Eddie just seems forlorn. Steve is afraid the only way he\u2019ll cheer up is if Steve puts on the mask, if he confirms the very truth he\u2019s so scared of. Which he can\u2019t do right now. He won\u2019t. He\u2019s going to selfishly keep this friendship, this whatever-it-is, as long as he can. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s eyes are unfocused. He\u2019s high, but Steve can\u2019t really gauge how much. He wonders if Eddie got into the brownies he kept from the party a week ago. If he got high for fun, or to get away from something.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eddie sighs. His breath is a warm, white cloud contrasting the backdrop of the city, wet and cold. \u201cNo,\u201d and his lip wobbles. He quickly twists away from Steve, drops his stick into the ashtray. When he turns back, bold enough to face Steve straight on, his eyes are watery. \u201cI\u2019m ruining everything, Steve. <i>Everything.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Steve murmurs. He wants desperately for Eddie to believe him, to be reassured by two simple words, but Eddie only shuts his eyes tight, like he can\u2019t even bear to look at Steve, let alone listen to him. \u201cYou could never ruin anything, Eddie. You couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie shakily exhales. Opens his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie stands up. \u201cI need to be at the bar in an hour. Need to get ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s gone, like he was never there, leaving Steve to ponder the unfortunate web he\u2019s weaved, no pun intended. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s least favorite nemesis is Fisk. Probably. Well, maybe Rhino, because that guy is scary, but Fisk is just as big, and he\u2019s got a lot of money, which means a lot of power. And Steve keeps putting him in jail but the son of a bitch keeps bailing himself out, and it\u2019s a tiring game of cat and mouse. Well, man and spider. Whatever.</p>\n<p>Lucas is helping him this time, and Steve never realized how old he\u2019s gotten, because Lucas\u2019 recovery speed is practically nonexistent, and his wit is even better. He\u2019s tossing quips at Fisk that go right over Steve\u2019s head, and he couldn\u2019t be prouder.</p>\n<p>They fight against Fisk and his employees who seem to have gotten speciality training on the side, because no run of the mill accountant should have such a mean right hook. Steve wonders how the interviewing process goes.<i> Oh, you can count money? Good. Say, have you ever taken mixed martial arts?</i></p>\n<p>When it\u2019s all said and done, and Fisk is sitting in the back of a police car to await a trial he\u2019ll most definitely pay his way out of, Steve and Lucas stop by a pretzel stand and then perch themselves atop the green roof of Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNever knew he was that ugly up close,\u201d Lucas huffs around a cinnamon sugar pretzel, which isn\u2019t what Steve would\u2019ve chosen for the kid, but he\u2019s not his mother, so. </p>\n<p>Steve laughs. Takes a sip of his lemonade. It\u2019s more sweet than it is sour, just the way Steve likes it. \u201cI think all the Botox in his face is making him indestructible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Lucas snorts, shaking his head. Their masks are off as they watch the city slow down for the night. Never stop, just slow down. \u201cHe\u2019s got Botox armor, Steve. We\u2019ll never defeat him.\u201d</p>\n<p>They giggle in their post-fight delirium. As the adrenaline wears off and the sun begins to set, Lucas clears his throat. Wrings his fingers together. \u201cSo\u2026 I told Max.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe girl you brought to the party?\u201d Steve asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Lucas explains. \u201cI usually tell her everything, but when I got my powers, our relationship was strained. I was too secretive and she thought I didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore and it all just\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 came to a head the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve chews on his straw. He wonders how this eighteen-year-old is so casual about this. \u201cAren\u2019t you scared she\u2019ll get hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven't most of our enemies figured out our identities anyways?\u201d Lucas shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d rather she know what she\u2019s up against and make the decision for herself than think I don\u2019t like her anymore, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if she took it wrong?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cWhat if telling her ruined the entire relationship? What if she never spoke to you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucas gives him a weird look. \u201cI have more faith in Max than that, man. She\u2019s too good for me. Took it like a champ, and now our relationship is stronger than ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucas nudges Spider-Man\u2019s foot with his own. (He does this thing where he wears clothes over his suit sometimes. Air Jordans, basketball shorts, and a green bomber. It\u2019s cute. It\u2019s youthful. Steve thinks he should bring out a jacket one of these days. Swinging around can get pretty chilly, and he's never quite perfected the built-in suit heater he's always dreamed of.) \u201cYou haven\u2019t told Eddie, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas never going to,\u201d Steve starts, \u201cHe was always just my roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then he wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how it happened. I\u2019m so good at guarding myself \u2014 keeping this from happening. I\u2019ve never met someone who I actually wanted to tell, you know? Dustin found out on his own. Robin and you knew me as Spider-Man before you knew me as Steve. With Eddie, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s <i>scary</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna tell you what to do,\u201d Lucas says, \u201cEvery situation is different. But maybe you could start opening up to him in other ways? You could build up to the Spidey secret.\u201d</p>\n<p> Steve ponders the thought. \"Why are you so smart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my youth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve decides to follow Lucas\u2019 advice a week later, when he and Eddie are rotting away on their sofa, watching Youtube videos of suburban mothers shopping at places like HomeGoods and Target. Eddie used to make fun of Steve for watching this kind of shit, but now he actually seems to enjoy the content, commenting on his own opinions of the decor from time to time. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s complaining about how tacky Rae Dunn mugs are when Steve decides he can\u2019t hold it in any longer and interrupts him, \u201cCan I sleep with you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie pauses the television. He turns toward Steve, lifting a leg onto the couch. He\u2019s so attentive it hurts; makes Steve want to reach out and hold Eddie\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cOf course you can. Is everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s scanning Steve now, searching for a visible injury or any sign of pain.</p>\n<p>Steve can only shrug. Be honest, he tells himself. Open up to him. \u201cIt gets really cold at night, and I have trouble sleeping sometimes, so I was hoping you\u2019d let me crash with you. Just for tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie beams, and he's all sugarplums and salted caramel and windchimes as doorbells. Wild eyes, soft when they look at Steve. \u201cI\u2019m ready when you are, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Steve knows he asked for it, but now he\u2019s nervous. His flight response is kicking in, a melody of <i>get the fuck out while you can</i> bouncing around the sides of his brain like a DVD loading screen. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get the heater.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s room looks the same as it did before. Steve crawls under the covers, inhales the cinnamon smoke smell of Eddie; leaves Eddie to set up the heater.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Sleepy Stevie</i>,\u201d Eddie sing-songs while he fidgets with the space heater. It starts up with a low hum, and Steve is hit with a blast of hot air. \u201cCan you sit up for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>The gentle voice he\u2019s using makes Steve warm in places the heater doesn\u2019t quite reach. Caring. Sweet. Attentive. Steve sits up without a complaint, even though his bones ache and he\u2019s so tired. Too tired to really think at this moment, so he just lets himself feel. </p>\n<p>Eddie opens his nightstand drawer and pulls out a tube of ointment. \u201cBet you thought I wouldn\u2019t notice the shiner on your jaw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure the term 'shiner' is for eyes only,\u201d Steve mumbles. He\u2019s eyeing the tube. \u201cWhat is that, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArnica ointment,\u201d Eddie answers. He sits by Steve, cinnamon and laundry detergent. \u201cTilt your chin up for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The <i>for me</i> part of all of this is what makes Steve feel like he\u2019s being swallowed whole. That, and the soft touch of Eddie\u2019s calloused fingers placing cold ointment on his jaw, back and forth, like a caress. </p>\n<p>Steve makes the mistake of looking into Eddie\u2019s eyes. Those still-black holes that haunt him. \u201cAren't you gonna ask me what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie retracts his hand, wipes the remainder of the ointment on his pants. \u201cI need to stop prying,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Steve wonders what Eddie would say if he told him he likes when he pries. When he worries. When he huffs and puffs and talks shit about the cops and looks at Steve with those inky, concerned eyes\u2026 When he shows that he cares.</p>\n<p>Steve likes being cared for. <i> Be honest</i>. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d He shuffles back under the covers. Lays on the side of his face that isn\u2019t bruised. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I have someone looking out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie follows his lead, and they lay facing each other under a mountain of blankets that still struggle to keep the cold out. Eddie\u2019s eyes flutter shut the moment his head hits the pillow, but he\u2019s smiling. Voice groggy, happy, lazy: \u201cGood, because I like looking out for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They fall asleep together with the lamp light still on.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Spider-Man returns to Eddie a few days before Thanksgiving. </p>\n<p>Eddie knows it\u2019s a few days away only because he\u2019s going to see Wayne in Brooklyn, where they will complete their tradition of stuffing themselves with garlic knots at this little Italian restaurant a few blocks from Wayne\u2019s place. It's owned by the loudest couple Eddie has ever met, and they only have two tables, despite the often long line of people waiting to be served. Eddie thinks he'll take Steve there one day.</p>\n<p>Born and bred in NYC, Wayne is the only reason Eddie stays in this place. The only reason he loves this city is because Wayne taught him to when he was young, took him out into the fray and let him experience the chaos for himself. The good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s excited to see his uncle again. If just to get away from Steve, who has been opening up to Eddie a lot within the last few weeks. Something must\u2019ve shifted in their relationship, and Eddie can\u2019t pinpoint it, but he\u2019s thankful nonetheless. </p>\n<p>Steve reveals things about himself with a hesitant glimmer in his copper brown eyes. Always on edge, always ready to run. Eddie thinks he wasn\u2019t lying when he told him he doesn\u2019t know how to be a friend, because he opens up to Eddie in a clumsy, pure-hearted way. Like a child in a playground who's never been around other kids. Skinned knees and red cheeks and<i> fuck</i> if it doesn\u2019t make Eddie fall more in love.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s already gone home for the holiday. He\u2019s got a big family, and they all meet up at their matriarch's place in Boston for the week of Thanksgiving. One week of hell, Steve had told him while they folded clothes together one evening. Because yeah, they do chores together now. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s thinking about what time he\u2019ll leave tomorrow; if he should sleep in late or wake up early to pick up those blueberry scones Wayne likes but never buys.</p>\n<p>There are Christmas lights glistening in his periphrastic, fire escapes decorated as soon as Halloween faded into the night. Eddie and Steve have agreed to wait until they both return from their respective Thanksgiving feasts. It\u2019ll give them something to talk about as they untangle lights and drink eggnog. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s trying to remember if Steve likes Christmas music or not when Spiderman drops \u2014 literally \u2014 onto the fire escape.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d he moans, lying on his back. \u201cThat was <i>not</i> supposed to happen.\u201d He\u2019s wearing a blue windbreaker over his suit. Which would be comical, if he weren\u2019t already so cute.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s been over a month, but it feels like it\u2019s only been a day. Eddie finds that he isn\u2019t worried about what Spidey is thinking at all. He\u2019s not even worried about the kiss, or boundaries, or the fact that he ruined everything. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s just thinking about how much he missed him.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man stands, says something like <i>\"Nice of my to drop by, huh?\"</i> and Eddie is jumping into his arms, pushing him back against the railing, warm body against warm body. </p>\n<p>\u201cOof!\u201d Spidey huffs out a laugh, and then groans, \u201cWatch my back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eddie says, face buried in the pale blue nylon. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just\u2013 I missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spidey tenses, and then wraps his arms around Eddie\u2019s waist. He squeezes and lifts like Eddie weighs nothing. \u201cI missed you too. Sorry about the distance. I got scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018T\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it. I just want you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man smells like sweat and floral cologne. His voice mechanism sounds just as stupid as it always has. Everything about the moment is familiar, a puzzle piece forgotten under a table, finally found. That moment when it slots into place. The softness of a Thomas Kinkade painting, a lighthouse guiding a ship. The memory of coming home in the middle of the night, the hallway light left on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad to hear that,\u201d Spidey pulls back. His eye lenses squint, and somehow Eddie\u2019s has gotten good enough at reading them to know that it\u2019s a happy squint. \u201cLike, really glad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow,\u201d Eddie says. He tucks a curl behind his ear. The wind is picking up as the night grows darker. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be back on the first. We should catch up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first,\u201d Spidey repeats back to himself. \u201cOkay. Have a joint ready for me. And here, before I forget\u2013\u201d He pulls something out of his jacket pocket and places it in Eddie\u2019s hand. \u201cSo you can call me again. Anytime you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk about the kiss. They don\u2019t talk about Steve. They just wish each other well and Spider-Man swings away, a phantom of Eddie\u2019s wildest dreams. </p>\n<p>The only evidence he was there at all is the shiny new earpiece \u2014 <i>doohickey</i> \u2014 in Eddie\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>Thanksgiving with the Harringtons always lasts a little too long. They begin just shy of exciting, now that the majority of the cousins are adults with partners or babies of their own. Steve is pretty sure he\u2019s never held this many babies in his life, and it only increases his distant dream of having a family of his own.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not due back home until the third of December. Eight days with his family in his grandmother\u2019s house \u2014 however big it may be \u2014 feels like a millennium, especially when half of his relatives are asking him when he\u2019s going to get a girlfriend, and the other half are too drunk to filter themselves, disturbing him when he tries to sneak away for a nap.</p>\n<p>He takes an early bus on the first, citing business in the city to his family and promising he\u2019ll be back the next day even if he doesn\u2019t really want to. He kind of wants to go home and stay home.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to pay the fare and sit in the same place for five hours when he knows Eddie will be back at the apartment, happy to see him.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Well, happy to see Spider-Man.</i>\n</p>\n<p>The latter fact dims his mood only slightly. Steve is partially certain he\u2019d glue the vizard to his face if it meant receiving Eddie\u2019s affection in return. Which, thinking it over, is probably not a healthy thought to have, but Steve isn\u2019t exactly the poster child for self esteem, so\u2026</p>\n<p>He sleeps three out of the five hours, and spends the rest of the time listening to podcasts through his earphones. He also texts both Robin and Lucas to see how their Thanksgivings went. </p>\n<p>Lucas stays in the city because he lives in the city, along with his family. He had told Steve enthusiastically that Thanksgiving is one of the only holidays he gets to see his favorite uncle. </p>\n<p>Robin, since turning eighteen, has vehemently avoided visiting her family, so she stays in the city as well. She usually invites Steve over in the beginning of December for a weekend of drinking and stalking old classmates on Facebook. All the best drama happens around the holidays, and Robin\u2019s friend list is perfectly curated to showcase the most dramatic posts first. It\u2019s something Steve always looks forward to.</p>\n<p>He knows he\u2019ll have to take up Christmas patrol to make up for his long holiday. It\u2019s always like this when the holidays pile up: he and Robin trading off the city like they share custody. Now Lucas gets to join in on the fun. Maybe Steve could convince them to do some spidey-caroling. He did that one year, and there\u2019s nothing funnier than singing to a bunch of perplexed New Yorkers on Christmas Eve.</p>\n<p>He uses the bus station bathroom to change into his suit, stuffs his civilian clothes in a bush outside of the station, and crawls out of a hallway window. The quick swing back home is enough to make Steve excited. He never has someone to come home to. Now he does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not quite in the way he would like, but he cherishes it nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s curtains are drawn, his window closed. For a moment, Steve wonders if Eddie has gone out, or if he\u2019s sleeping. Maybe he doesn\u2019t actually want to see Spider-Man. Maybe Steve is thinking too much into this\u2013</p>\n<p>He knocks on the window.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just after noon. The sun is high in the sky but the entire city wears a chill that wasn\u2019t there a week ago. It\u2019s decorated as usual, seemingly overnight, wreathes on streetlights and those bigass ornaments stacked across from Radio City Music Hall. The tree lighting won\u2019t happen until tomorrow, which is a bummer, because Steve would like to see it. But he saw the unlit tree briefly as he zipped by, which satisfies him enough.</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s window is pushed open. Eddie, in all his sweetness, is there, wearing a Christmas sweater over a pair of plaid pants. \u201cMerry Christmas, Spidey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve groans. He forgot that Eddie is the type to start decorating as soon as the calendar page turns. \u201cMy turkey hasn\u2019t even digested yet,\u201d he tells Eddie. \u201cGive it a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Eddie grabs something from his room and then climbs out onto the escape. The thing he grabbed is a mug of hot chocolate, topped with marshmallows and a candy cane for stirring. \u201cThis is the best time of the year!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a walking commercial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Eddie giggles, his cheeks flushed, and Steve wonders if he\u2019s just a little bit day-drunk. \u201cHey, Spidey, you should change your suit colors to red and green. Just for the month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not be doing that,\u201d Steve deadpans. His voice sounds so weird through the mechanism. He barely ever activates it, since hardly anyone in New York knows Steve Harrington enough to recognize his voice, but with Eddie he needs the extra layer of protection. </p>\n<p>Eddie slumps into his chair the way he always does, pulls a lighter out of his pocket and a joint from behind his ear. \u201cDidn\u2019t know Spidey was such a Scrooge,\u201d he mumbles around the stick.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Steve argues helplessly. He reaches out and takes the stick from Eddie\u2019s lips. From his perch on the railing, he has the perfect view of Eddie\u2019s doe eyes, brown and sparkly in the glow of the fairy lights hanging from the apartment above them. \u201cI like the holidays. Less crime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie hums. \u201cGuess that makes sense. Why do the holidays make people happier?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSubliminal messaging?\u201d Steve guesses with a shrug. He lifts his mask and takes a puff, but instead of turning to shield himself, he leaves the mask rolled up just at the bridge of his nose. The air is cooler outside of the mask, not as moist from his breath. His incessant need to chatter with his enemies can really fog up the lenses. Maybe that will be his next project: better mask ventilation. \u201cAll those songs about the best time of the year\u2026 plus Christmas bonuses\u2026 and I guess visiting family, if you like your family\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like your family?\u201d Eddie\u2019s already high. Maybe he finished off a joint inside, which is something he does when Steve\u2019s not home, as if the smell of weed doesn\u2019t seep into every fabric in the entire place, immediately outing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <i>not</i> like them,\u201d Steve shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s just complicated, I guess. I\u2019m okay to see them on the holidays, but that\u2019s pretty much it. They\u2019re not really interested in anyone who isn\u2019t paired up or having kids, so I\u2019m all but chopped liver.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kids, Spidey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Steve says before he can help himself, and the admission shocks Eddie, who blinks owlishly at him. \u201cI mean, wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have a bunch of spiderlings running around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m imagining a baby crawling up a wall,\u201d Eddie says, giggling. \u201cWhich sounds like parenting hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen anyway,\u201d Steve takes one last pull and then hands the joint back to Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it would be safe to go off and have a family. Knowing what they might go through if any of my enemies found out about them\u2026 And I wouldn\u2019t want to keep it a secret either but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s too complicated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s cheeks hollow when he sucks in. But they're fuller tonight, like he ate well this past weekend, which comforts Steve in the pit of his chest. He wants to kiss Eddie suddenly, press against him until he can feel his teeth through his skin. Feel his cozy-warm stomach beneath his sweater.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get not wanting kids,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cMaybe wait until after you retire and can get one of those witness protection houses or something. But what would be wrong with a partner? I mean, an adult would know what they\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey really wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Steve says. He\u2019s thinking of nights bound and gagged, starved and dehydrated, forced to sit and pray he\u2019d figure a way out of whatever mess he got himself into \u2014 that they wouldn\u2019t find his parents or his friends, and the thought, the fear, of putting Eddie in that kind of situation, some scary, fucked up situation that could be prevented, makes Steve\u2019s chest twinge in pain. He feels dizzy all at once. \u201cAnyone I love is safer not knowing.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Dear God</i> it\u2019s true even though he wishes it weren\u2019t. He wishes he were more powerful. That he was all-knowing. That he could prevent danger and confess to Eddie, but he\u2019s just not sure that\u2019s the case. Or that that will ever be the case.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gotta know that if someone loves you, they\u2019d be willing to go through all the spidey shit, too,\u201d Eddie says. He waves his joint around as if to make a point, \u201cAnd you gotta know that you\u2019re worth all the spidey shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve blinks at him. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2013 It\u2019s really dangerous, Eddie\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of us like danger,\u201d Eddie drawls, a lazy smile on his face as he lulls his head to the side and peers up at Steve. There\u2019s something in his eyes, like hope, or the promise of hope. \u201cJust so you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie spends the two days before Steve gets home fixing up the house and getting it ready for decorating. He vacuums the rugs, the drapes, and the couches. He wipes down the walls and the counter and splurges on some new air fresheners that smell like citrus and spruce. He gets their decorations out of storage and sets the boxes in the hallway, out of the way until he and Steve can get to them.</p>\n<p>Their shared space feels empty without Steve. That much is certain.</p>\n<p>Somehow, it\u2019s easier to ignore Steve when he\u2019s just a room away. Maybe it\u2019s the knowledge that he\u2019s <i>there</i> if Eddie needs him that relaxes his mind. But when he\u2019s in Boston, reading Eddie\u2019s texts but not answering them, posting pictures on his private Instagram of him holding his baby nieces and nephews, Eddie thinks he may be losing his mind.</p>\n<p>Turns out absence doesn\u2019t just make the heart grow fonder, it also drives one crazy.</p>\n<p>He tries to call Spider-Man, but the hero doesn\u2019t answer. So Eddie checks social media to see what he\u2019s been up to, and it turns out Spider-Man hasn\u2019t been seen in the city for awhile, except for the day he came to see Eddie.</p>\n<p>Which is weird. That knowledge tickles some part of Eddie\u2019s brain, and it feels a bit like there\u2019s a word at the tip of his tongue but he can\u2019t quite figure it out.</p>\n<p>It becomes paranoia as the day fades. Eddie flips through the channels until he finds something he can focus on, but nothing is sticking. He starts scrolling through his phone and ends up on Steve\u2019s cousin\u2019s Instagram story, watching their day play out and hoping Steve will show up in the background.</p>\n<p>The word <i>pathetic</i> crosses his mind a few times.</p>\n<p>He downloads tinder, deletes it, downloads it again, but then he sees a profile of some guy taking a selfie with Spider-Man, so he deletes it for good and stuffs his phone down between the couch cushions in the hopes of tricking his brain into doing something else. Out of sight, out of mind. </p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t know where he stands with Spider-Man. He watches the ceiling fan spin and tries to sort facts from feelings the way his childhood therapist taught him to.</p>\n<p>He kissed Spider-Man. <i>Fact.</i></p>\n<p>Spider-Man kissed him back. <i>Fact.</i></p>\n<p>Eddie likes Spider-Man. <i>Fact, but also feeling. </i></p>\n<p>Spider-Man seems to like Eddie back. <i>Fact.</i></p>\n<p>Eddie likes Steve. <i>Fact that will never leave his head. Feeling that will never leave his heart.</i></p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t like Eddie back. <i>Feeling.</i></p>\n<p>Steve will never like Eddie back.<i> The worst feeling in the entire world.</i></p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie works a double the morning Steve gets back in from Boston. Taking more shifts is good for him, he thinks. It forces him to think about something that isn\u2019t Steve. Or Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>He gets into his busywork. Mixing drinks and ignoring drunken small talk because he doesn\u2019t get paid to talk to people, thank God. He does listen to the bar gossip, though, and when a large group of sorority girls file in, he nearly sighs in relief, because they always have the best stories.</p>\n<p>With their company, the shift passes quickly, and Eddie is in good spirits on his walk home.</p>\n<p>Miraculously, he forgets that Steve is due home this morning. He\u2019s tired on his feet, ready to crawl under his covers and sleep the entire day away, but when he opens the door, Steve is in the kitchen, mixing something in a bowl.</p>\n<p>The entire apartment smells like chocolate.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Eddie leans against the counter and closes his eyes. Inhales. \u201cSmells like heaven in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, Steve is staring at him, cheeks pink. \u201cUm.\u201d He blinks, eyes tracing over Eddie\u2019s face for so long that Eddie reaches up, wipes at his mouth in case there\u2019s any food left from the snack break he took three hours ago. \u201cBrownies.\u201d He holds up the bowl.</p>\n<p>Eddie rests his chin on his palm, watches Steve putter around. He feels warm all over, because Steve is in comfy clothes \u2014 sweatpants and a hoodie. His glasses make him look adorable, and his hair must\u2019ve been recently washed, because his waves are curled more than usual. And, now that he can identify the brownie smell, Eddie can also smell the foggy scent of Steve\u2019s shampoo, and maybe a bath bomb or two. \u201cDid you take a bath?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve mumbles. \u201cUsed a peppermint vanilla bath bomb. It was shaped like a candy cane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery festive,\u201d Eddie comments. He bites down any other quip he wants to say, like <i>you\u2019re so cute</i>, <i>please tell me more about your goofy bath bombs</i>, and <i>I love you</i>. </p>\n<p>\n<i>I love you so much and I want this forever. You in the kitchen with your fake glasses and your overpriced soaps and your store-bought brownie mix.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d Steve pours the batter into a greased pan and shoves it in the preheated oven.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Eddie yawns, realizes he won\u2019t be awake for much longer. He probably won\u2019t even be able to wait until the brownies are done. </p>\n<p>\u201cLike you\u2019re\u2013\u201d Steve bites his lip and looks away. He walks over to the fridge, opens the door, pulls out a bottle of beer. He shakes his head. \u201cNevermind. \u2018s Stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing you say is stupid,\u201d Eddie mumbles, his eyes closing. God, he\u2019s so tired. And he smells boozy. He should shower but he doesn\u2019t think he can stay awake long enough to.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long was your shift?\u201d Steve\u2019s voice is kind. Eddie doesn\u2019t have to open his eyes to know that Steve is probably looking at him with big, worried eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI worked a double. Been there since ten last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna,\u201d Eddie says, even though he\u2019s halfway into dreamland already. \u201cWanna stay up and talk to you. And we\u2019re supposed to decorate now that you\u2019re back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve hums. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up. We can do it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise,\u201d and Steve\u2019s voice sounds closer. \u201cNeed me to carry you to bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>He\u2019s teasing, but the question leaves a flutter of butterflies to battle behind Eddie\u2019s ribcage. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, pouting and playing along. \u201cMy bones are like mush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on, \u2018kay?\u201d Steve mumbles into Eddie\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? What are you\u2013 <i>Steve!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve scoops Eddie up like he weighs nothing, one arm under his back and one beneath the bend of his knees. <i>He isn\u2019t even breathing differently,</i> Eddie thinks. He buries his face in Steve\u2019s neck to keep the man from seeing just how much his strength affects Eddie. <i>Honestly, where does he get the strength from?</i></p>\n<p>Steve drops Eddie onto his bed with measured ease. <i>His core strength must be insane</i>. He pulls the blankets up over Eddie\u2019s body and tucks him in. \u201cHere. Get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in my work clothes,\u201d Eddie bemoans.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo take them off,\u201d Steve says casually like Eddie stripping down to his underwear in front of him wouldn't send him into an immediate spiral.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he says weakly. \u201cGo bake your stupid brownies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve snorts. Eddie feels Steve\u2019s fingernails scratch at his head. <i>I love you, </i>he\u2019s thinking again.<i> I\u2019ll never love anyone more.</i></p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s knuckles brush over Eddie\u2019s cheek, feather-light. It\u2019s the last thing Eddie feels before he gives himself away to sleep.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Mid-December finds the Munson-Harrington apartment in soft spirits.</p>\n<p>Steve takes less hours at the lab and sends more shots of Spider-Man to Jameson \u2014 through email this time, so he doesn\u2019t have to step foot in that godawful building again. Time is getting easier to manage. He speaks to his boss about more flexible hours, and they work out something that makes everything feel a bit easier.</p>\n<p>He spends his spare time in his room, working on a new suit design; this one has heated pads in the hands, feet, and torso that can be activated through the control panel on his wrist. It also has better ventilation in the suit, and it will have Bluetooth built into the mask, so that Steve can activate it through voice.</p>\n<p>His new boss, Otto Octavius, seems to like him. He gives him access to one of the private labs, and Steve has enough space to prototype his suits and web shooters. He\u2019s been working on an electric web prototype after his run in with Electro two years ago. He\u2019s never quite perfected it, though, and there\u2019s a lot of things that could go wrong if he doesn\u2019t get the mechanics down.</p>\n<p>He sneaks Lucas, Dustin, and Robin in and out of the lab when he can. They work in tandem; Max visits every now and again with takeout. One conversation with her, and Steve can see why Lucas likes her so much. He wonders how the others would react to Eddie if he ever gets the strength to tell him. Would they welcome him as easily as they\u2019ve welcomed Max?</p>\n<p>His new suit is completed by mid-December. The white spider motif matches the snow that falls steadily outside, and Steve can\u2019t resist taking a few well-timed pictures for Jameson. He\u2019ll probably get top spot for the Christmas morning spread. He probably won\u2019t get paid any extra for it.</p>\n<p>Whatever. That\u2019s why he has an actual job now.</p>\n<p>December nights are spent at home, watching reruns of Christmas specials while Eddie stumbles around, getting ready for work. He\u2019s taken on extra shifts, apparently staff morale is lower around the holidays, and, as he told Steve, Eddie has no reason <i>not</i> to go to work.</p>\n<p>Steve wonders what he would have to do to be the reason Eddie stayed home a night or two. If Eddie would ever just say <i>fuck it</i> and sit beside him, sharing the warmth of Steve\u2019s blanket while they watch what feels like Friends\u2019 twentieth Christmas-centered episode. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as Steve verbalizing his wants; asking for Eddie to stay with him.</p>\n<p>But work is work, and Steve doesn\u2019t want to get in the way of that, so he watches numbly while Eddie slips out into the cold, bundled up from head to toe.</p>\n<p>He tries to focus on the television but the images bleed into each other. Steve finds himself pacing the hallway, ultimately sneaking into Eddie\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just going to be a quick nap, he thinks. A quick nap, and then he\u2019ll move back into his cold, industrial room, and Eddie will never know that Steve craves the ghost of him that lingers on his sheets.</p>\n<p>He falls asleep right away, and stays asleep through the night.</p>\n<p>(When Eddie comes home from his five-hour shift, he\u2019s ready to climb into bed and snooze the rest of the night away. </p>\n<p>He shuffles around the apartment quietly, sure Steve is fast asleep in his own room. He takes a shower as quickly as he can, pulling on a pair of boxers he left folded on the sink for this precise moment \u2014 <i>thank you, past Eddie</i>.</p>\n<p>The last thing he expects to see when he enters his room is Steve, curled into his sheets, hugging his pillow to his chest. Eddie\u2019s heart melts at the sight, and he does his best to climb into bed beside Steve without waking him. </p>\n<p>He sleeps without a pillow. It\u2019s an easy sacrifice to make.)</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Sometimes Steve forgets Eddie doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s bisexual.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an easy thing to keep from people \u2014 Steve has always been too busy to pursue <i>anyone</i>, so people hardly ever question his relationship status. It might be weird for a guy who doesn\u2019t date to come out as bisexual; it might be anticlimactic. Steve might tell everyone and they might laugh at him, or tell them they knew already, or worse yet, tell him it doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019ll never get anyone anyways.</p>\n<p>The last one is a bit hyperbolic, but Steve has radioactive spider powers, so forgive him if his mind jumps to the worst case scenario first.</p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t mention Steve\u2019s love life, or lack thereof, often, or even at all. But he is hesitant at times to touch Steve.</p>\n<p>Steve wouldn\u2019t notice it if Eddie was just a normal roommate. But Eddie is, unfortunately, the most endearing person Steve has ever met, and he\u2019s wormed his way into Steve\u2019s heart with little to no warning. Which means Steve just has to stand here and take it \u2014 a heart full of Eddie \u2014 and act like it\u2019s not the only thing he thinks about nowadays.</p>\n<p>He knows Eddie is gay. It\u2019s not exactly something the man keeps hidden from everyone. Sometimes, he\u2019ll make little quips about Steve\u2019s \u201cstraightness\u201d. Normal jokes recycled from Twitter, and they would be funny if Steve <i>were</i> straight. Sometimes, Eddie will reach out for affection, and he\u2019ll draw back just as quickly, as if he\u2019s not sure what\u2019s crossing the line for a \u201cstraight guy\u201d like Steve.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not straight. He wants to tell Eddie as much, nearly every day now, because it feels like something Eddie should know. It feels like maybe, just maybe, Steve would have a chance with Eddie if Eddie knew.</p>\n<p>Like maybe Steve\u2019s availability might put him on Eddie\u2019s radar, <i>at the least.</i></p>\n<p>They\u2019re eating pizza on Eddie\u2019s bed, too cold to leave the only room with a proper heater. And sure, they could bring the space heater into the living room or kitchen, but Steve doubts it would be as cozy as it is in here, where the room smells like Eddie; pine and cinnamon and a little bit of smoke.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re eating on top of the covers, classic rock covers of Christmas songs crooning between them from Eddie\u2019s phone speaker. </p>\n<p>Eddie is telling Steve about the awful holiday drinks he has to mix this month. Steve is thinking about how much he wants to kiss him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a lot: the want to kiss a friend. Someone so close but so far away. Because Eddie and Spider-Man <i>have</i> kissed. This leads Steve to think Eddie must like Spider-Man: must have some sort of romantic feelings for him. But would those feelings transfer if Eddie knew who Spider-Man was? Or would Eddie feel betrayed? Would he kick Steve out and never speak to him again?</p>\n<p>\u201cStevie? Did I lose you?\u201d Eddie waves his pizza crust in front of Steve\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d Steve says. Fuck it, he\u2019ll just get it out there. His second scariest secret to tell, and he\u2019s already said it to Eddie once, behind a mask, so it\u2019s not like this would be any different, right? </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s brows furrow. \u201cOkay. What is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve watches Eddie place the crust in the pizza box. He watches him close the box and set it on the floor. He watches him grab a few napkins and wipe his hands of any sauce that might reside. He passes a clean napkin to Steve, and Steve wrings it in between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m bisexual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie blinks. \u201cOh.\u201d He blinks again, looks away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting\u2013 Wait, what? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d Steve says, rolling his shoulders back. Loosening the tension. \u201cI just thought you should know, you know. Don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable since I\u2019ve been sleeping in your bed and stuff. Not that I\u2019m\u2013 like\u2013 planning on doing anything other than sleeping but\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Eddie rests his palm on Steve\u2019s leg. \u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable. I\u2019m really glad you told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve feels a bit hot, a separate sort of hot from the heat of the room. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Eddie leans in, winks in that playful way of his, the warm way that makes Steve feel like he could tell Eddie anything, \u201cI\u2019m really proud of you, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gulps. \u201cYeah. Okay. Thanks, Eddie. That, uh, that means a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie is looking at him with the warmest smile Steve has ever seen. His insides feel ooey and gooey in the best way, like soft marshmallow fluff or a fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolate chip cookie.</p>\n<p>One secret down. One to go.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>For the first time in his life, Steve seeks someone out after he gets injured.</p>\n<p>He comes home with a cut across his arm, after one of the most embarrassing accidents he\u2019s ever had in his career as Spider-Man. </p>\n<p>Usually when he gets hit by a car, it\u2019s moving. And he\u2019s usually doing something really cool like swinging across the engine pipe and shooting his web through the open window at whatever perps he\u2019s currently chasing.</p>\n<p>Today, he is swinging across New York City, scoping it out. Sometimes, his webs don\u2019t stick properly. Usually this happens in winter, when his artificial web formula doesn\u2019t stick to ice very well. (Steve finds out later that Lucas\u2019 natural webbing sticks to ice just fine, furthering his jealousy for the spiderling.) </p>\n<p>He\u2019s swinging over a garbage truck when his web doesn\u2019t catch, and he falls sideways, cutting his arm on the side of the lifting mechanism. He falls onto the icy road, on top of his injured arm, because that\u2019s just his spidey-luck at work. Luckily, it\u2019s a truck parked outside in the middle of the night, so no one seems to see his mistake.</p>\n<p>His arm is throbbing by the time he slips through his bedroom window. He peels off his torn suit (his new white spider suit, too, damn it) and replaces it with a white tank and black sweatpants. He walks into the bathroom and grabs his first aid kit, and he\u2019s hit with a feeling he\u2019s never really felt before.</p>\n<p>He wants to wake up Eddie. He wants to go get him and ask for comfort. He wants Eddie to tell him to be more careful, and he wants Eddie\u2019s hands on him. His tender, rough hands.</p>\n<p>Eddie answers his door with a sleepy frown on his face. \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve turns to his side wordlessly, showcasing his partially-bruised, partially-bleeding bicep. \u201cCan you help me disinfect this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s eyes widen a fraction of a second before he nods. \u201cOkay, go sit in the bathroom. I\u2019m gonna go get a washcloth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sitting on the edge of the bathtub, Steve inhales the lingering smell of lavender. When Eddie comes in, he carries with him the same smell. \u201cDid you use my <i>French Kiss</i> bubble bar? Wait\u2026 Eddie Munson, did you take a <i>bath</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s eyes flit across Steve\u2019s face, probably hoping he won\u2019t yell at him for using his \u2014 granted, limited edition \u2014 bath bomb. \u201cFrench kiss?\u201d He asks, voice low. </p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s trying not to break the silence of the night. Maybe the word kiss has him looking at Steve\u2019s lips, which in return has Steve biting at the skin, his brain screaming at Eddie to fucking <i>do</i> something. \u201cThe one shaped like a mountain,\u201d Steve squeaks, partly distracted by the way Eddie\u2019s eyes seem to darken.</p>\n<p>Eddie looks up. Blinks. Clears his throat. \u201cSorry,\u201d he laughs nervously. \u201cIt just smelled really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to start getting two of each when I go,\u201d Steve says when Eddie turns to grab the rubbing alcohol. He hisses when the liquid touches the scrape on his arm. He\u2019s been running on shock this entire night, and the first zap of pain washes over the throbbing feeling. The result is a pained whimper, as Eddie lightly presses against his tender bruises. \u201cI \u2013 <i>Shit, that smarts</i> \u2013 ran into a garbage truck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck did you manage that, sweetheart?\u201d Eddie questions to distract him, and Steve knows it\u2019s because Eddie is getting peroxide out (Steve is starting to think Eddie doesn\u2019t know much about first aid) but it\u2019s working.</p>\n<p>The nickname stuns him into silence, even though Eddie has been using it both frequently and sweetly. Steve likes it. Too much, probably, and he\u2019s so busy thinking about how not to seem like he likes it, that he misses Eddie wrapping some gauze and a bandage around his arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow you need painkillers and some rest,\u201d Eddie mutters under his breath while he packs up the first aid kit, like he\u2019s talking to himself. When the kit is tucked away, Eddie turns back to Steve and gives him the sweetest smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve follows Eddie to his room, swallows the painkillers dry, and snuggles deep beneath Eddie\u2019s blankets, favoring his injured side. \u201cDo you work tonight?\u201d </p>\n<p>The mumble reaches Eddie as he is quite literally crawling over Steve to get back into bed. \u201cNope. I\u2019ll probably be up in a few hours anyways, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Eddie faces Steve and gives him a teasing look, \u201cYou want me gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Steve is quick to react, reaching out for Eddie\u2019s sweater in an effort to placate him. His fingers curl into the cable knit. \u201cI meant, oh, like, I don\u2019t want you to get up in a few hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie stares at him, perplexed. His eyes have that same look he gave Steve back when he came home to him baking brownies. It looks like admiration, but it\u2019s something else. Steve can see Eddie\u2019s eyes twinkle even in the dark room. He hates spidey sense sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think the painkillers are kicking in,\u201d Eddie says, like he handed Steve something stronger than two Tylenol pills. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just like waking up with you,\u201d Steve continues\u2026 and yeah, maybe the painkillers <i>are</i> kicking in. That, or Eddie makes Steve comfortable enough to admit to, frankly, embarrassing thoughts. So Steve does what any adult man would do in his situation, and he pretends to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>He can feel Eddie\u2019s eyes on him. And then, ever so soundly, he\u2019s shuffling under the covers, pressing his lips to Steve\u2019s forehead. </p>\n<p>Steve <i>really</i> hates his spidey sense.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>No one is quite as eclectic as Chrissy is when it comes to gift wrapping.</p>\n<p>Two weeks until Christmas, and Chrissy throws her annual Eddie-and-Chrissy Wrapping Party, where they pile all of their gifts in the living room, get drunk on eggnog martinis, and watch the shittiest Hallmark movies they can find. The table is covered in wrapping paper, tulle, glitter, tape, scissors, ribbons, and other craft supplies Eddie can\u2019t name. Each present Chrissy makes looks like it came out of a catalog.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so ugly!\u201d Chrissy throws a candy cane at her television. \u201cAnd he\u2019s rude to the wait staff!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s gonna dump him for the single dad,\u201d Eddie says, not as bothered by the movie as Chrissy is. Truthfully, he sort of likes the predictable cheesiness of it all. Is it incredibly lame? Yes. Does he care? Not really. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we please put on a gay movie next?\u201d She whines like she isn\u2019t the one with the remote. \u201cIf I have to watch more straight people fall in love\u2026 I\u2019ll just <i>die</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of straight people\u2026\u201d Eddie applies tape to the corner of his gift for his uncle. \u201cSteve is not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chrissy looks ten times more thrilled than Eddie, which is weird, because Eddie is the one with the crush. She slaps her hands on the table and leans over, her jingle bell headband ringing obnoxiously. \u201cGay Steve is real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBi Steve is real, yeah.\u201d Eddie goes through the whole conversation he had with Seve just a week ago. \u201cHe said I could tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Chrissy taps the remote to her chin. \u201cSo you\u2019re gay, and Steve is bi, and he\u2019s friends with that really hot lesbian who came to your Halloween party\u2026 and <i>I\u2019m</i> a single lesbian\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you seriously using this new information to try and get yourself a new girlfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, like you\u2019re gonna use it to get a boyfriend,\u201d Chrissy rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might!\u201d Eddie retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen do it!\u201d Chrissy points to his phone, lying abandoned on her couch cushions. \u201cCall Steve right now and ask him on a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie sputters. God, he hates when she\u2019s right. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie,\u201d she bemoans, wiping a hand down her face. \u201cYour chances of him saying yes just went from zero to like, sixty percent! There is literally no better time to ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the holidays,\u201d Eddie bargains. \u201cI\u2019ll ask him out then.\u201d</p>\n<p>The onscreen protagonist kisses her ugly date, and Chrissy turns off the television. \u201cEnough of that. I\u2019m turning on Carol.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Although there are less crimes around the holidays, it can be said that the crimes that <i>are</i> committed are often worse in morality and also, unfortunately, fatalities.</p>\n<p>Steve has seen a lot of death in his career as Spider-Man. Not at his own hands \u2014 he\u2019s made a commitment long ago to keep even his enemies alive; to never kill. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s fighting Rhino only one week before Christmas. </p>\n<p>Rhino, a man standing at eight feet, wide and sturdy and strong, acts as a sort of battering ram wherever he goes. The rumor is that he got involved with the Russian mafia, and they injected him with experimental drugs that ultimately gave him super strength and violent tendencies.</p>\n<p>And although Steve has good agility, Rhino is huge. Bigger than Fisk, and less calculated, so that his movements are clumsy and often more dangerous. </p>\n<p>He chases Steve into a back alley. There\u2019s a man Steve hadn\u2019t seen before, hunched beside a dumpster, shivering from the cold. If Steve <i>had</i> seen him, he never would\u2019ve gone into the alley. He never would\u2019ve put a civilian in danger. </p>\n<p>He tries to warn the man, tries to grab him, swing him to safety, but Rhino tramples them before Steve can get them safely out of the way. </p>\n<p>The man dies in the hospital after a few hours of unsuccessful surgery.</p>\n<p>Steve is in his suit, waiting around the hospital with cops and first responders, refusing any medical help and waiting for the news. His ribs feel like they\u2019re rattling in his chest, and he can feel a migraine forming. The inside of his mask is wet from shocked tears.</p>\n<p>When they get the news, he starts shaking \u2014 violently. He\u2019s staring at the hospital floor through his cracked lens, but he can\u2019t make out the color of the tile.</p>\n<p>A first responder drops an electric blanket over Steve\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI need to check your injuries, Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI can't take my mask off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need medical attention,\u201d the man responds. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI heal quickly. I\u2019m fine. Does\u2014 Does his family know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of contacting loved ones. He was homeless, so it\u2019s going to take a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Steve buries his face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2013 I didn\u2019t see him in the alley. I swear, I didn\u2019t see him. I tried to help\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d It\u2019s a cop interrupting this time. Steve thinks he knows the lady\u2019s name, but he can\u2019t place it. \u201cSir, can I drive you somewhere? Do you have somewhere you can go?\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie gets the call during his late night shift. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit of a blur, the desperate pleading with his boss to let him go, the taxi drive to the hospital, the sight of Spider-Man amongst civilians, shaking beneath a foil blanket.</p>\n<p>Eddie gets him into a taxi, pays the driver extra to not talk to either of them, even though he can tell the man has questions. He gets him to drop them off a few streets away. Just so no one knows where Eddie lives, where Spider-Man might have a connection.</p>\n<p>They stumble home, Spider-Man unsettlingly quiet aside from sparse sniffles. Eddie keeps his arm around the man, trying not to show how scared he is. </p>\n<p>He drops Spider-Man on his couch as softly as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll go get the first aid kit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d the hero says. He curls up on the couch, his suit dirty and torn. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone before you wake up. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey, someone died tonight, I think I need to take care of you\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Spider-Man says, voice warbly, like the voice mechanism got broken. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2013 It\u2019s not fair, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie mumbles, and his heart breaks. He kneels down beside the couch and places his palm over Spider-Man\u2019s chest, where his heart is beating wildly, despite his sluggish movements. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can't find his family,\u201d Spider-Man shakes with a sob. \u201cEddie, I killed a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Eddie presses down on Spider-Man\u2019s chest, hoping the pressure might ease the shock. He has no idea what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s just thinking of all the ways he grounds himself, with weighted blankets and soft textures. \u201cYou didn\u2019t, sweetheart. I promise, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man shifts on the couch. Curls into himself. \u201cDon\u2019t take off my mask,\u201d he says, and it breaks Eddie\u2019s heart that Spider-Man thinks the thought would cross his mind. \u201cBut could you stay? Just in the room with me? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I can,\u201d Eddie whispers. He sits against the couch for hours as Spider-Man falls into a fitful sleep. He wonders what he\u2019s going to say to Steve when he wakes up and finds Spider-Man on his couch.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The Rhino attack is all over the news.</p>\n<p>Eddie eats a bowl of cereal and watches the reports all morning, having no idea what the details of the attack were. Though nearly every news outlet \u2014 sans Jameson \u2014 is sure Spider-Man did his best, there\u2019s still an outcry of hate online, with rumors about Spider-Man\u2019s true identity being brought into question.</p>\n<p>Eddie exits out of all social media and texts Steve. He hasn\u2019t come out of his room yet, and Eddie doesn\u2019t want to pry, but the attack last night has kind of shaken him up, so he sends a quick <i>good morning</i> text like it\u2019s something he does every day. He turns off the news, and he waits.</p>\n<p>Steve comes out of his room around noontime, garbed in sweatpants and a hoodie, hood up. </p>\n<p>Before Eddie can say anything, Steve climbs onto the couch beside him and curls up, legs over Eddie\u2019s lap and cheek on Eddie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d he croaks, and he sounds sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie wraps an arm around the small of Steve\u2019s back and pulls him in, relishing in the warmth of their bodies touching. \u201cI was worried about you. Did you stay inside last night? You weren\u2019t near the attack, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve tenses in Eddie\u2019s grip, then relaxes. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, though it doesn\u2019t answer Eddie\u2019s question. \u201cI just want to stay with you today. Can we do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie wonders if this is how Spider-Man feels when he saves people. This pride, blossoming in his chest at the idea of Steve wanting to spend the day with him. Like maybe Eddie is a safe space for him. </p>\n<p>(Eddie <i>is</i> a safe space for Steve. He\u2019s the only person Steve feels like he can be around right now without falling apart.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s had to do this before \u2014 endure survivor\u2019s guilt, get accused of murder, closet his suit and lay low for a few weeks while the mobs die down \u2014 but he\u2019s never done it <i>with</i> anyone.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man has. Spider-Man has Robin and Lucas to take up patrol and emergencies while he lays low. Spider-Man has random strangers reaching out online and nice first responders giving him blankets.</p>\n<p>Steve has never had anyone. Not like this. He can feel Eddie\u2019s heartbeat next to his own. He wonders how Eddie knew exactly how to take care of him last night. If it was his actions that helped Steve fall asleep or if it was just his presence. </p>\n<p>Steve is starting to wonder how he\u2019s gotten through anything in the past without Eddie.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, he\u2019ll look up the number of a grief counselor, make up some story and get help for the trauma part of it, the way he always does when something like this happens. And then he\u2019ll compartmentalism and keep going, because someone has to protect the city, and Steve has the power, so he has the responsibility.</p>\n<p>But today, he\u2019s going to stay in Eddie\u2019s arms for as long as he can.)</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Wayne comes over Christmas Day for a dinner of waffles, eggs, and bacon. Turkey bacon this year, because Wayne has been told to watch his cholesterol. He eats it grumpily at the table while Eddie works the waffle iron. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s so focused on his task that he doesn\u2019t hear the door open, or Steve walk into the kitchen. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie whips around to see Wayne standing, shaking Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cEddie told me all about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood things, I hope,\u201d Steve says nervously, eyes darting from Wayne to Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat things,\u201d Wayne says, and Steve just beams. Sweet and saccharine.</p>\n<p>Eddie has to turn back to the waffle iron to keep himself from doing something stupid, like confessing his love for Steve in the middle of their kitchen, in front of his uncle of all people.</p>\n<p>\u201cEat with us,\u201d Wayne coaxes. \u201cUnless you have plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Wayne is too perceptive when it comes to Eddie. It\u2019s not as if Eddie goes waxing poetic about his roommate to the man who raised him, but he supposes one can\u2019t really hide the look of admiration he most likely gets when he\u2019s talking about Steve.</p>\n<p>Steve sheds his coat. \u201cNo plans,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cI\u2019m all yours,\u201d he says to Wayne, but he\u2019s looking at Eddie, eyebrows raised, lips quirked.</p>\n<p>\n<i>God, Eddie could eat him alive.</i>\n</p>\n<p>He makes three waffles. One with chocolate chips, because he knows Steve hates plain waffles. </p>\n<p>When they sit, Eddie lets Steve and Wayne lead the conversation. He\u2019s too busy watching snowflakes melt into Steve\u2019s hair to put any effort into his answers. But he listens. </p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s Christmas Day schedule has been jam-packed. He visited his parents, then took a subway to Robin\u2019s, where they spent the majority of the day together. He had invited Eddie to join him, but Wayne was coming over, and Eddie thinks being Steve\u2019s plus-one for holiday festivities might not help his crush. So, he had declined. Steve took the rejection with a graceful shrug, promised he\u2019d bring home some of his mom\u2019s cookies for Eddie, and left bundled in a blue windbreaker and a red scarf.</p>\n<p>The colors flashed in Eddie\u2019s mind like police lights; <i>notice me</i> colors. But then Wayne had come to the door, and Eddie didn\u2019t have time to think anymore about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin always gets me underwear and socks,\u201d Steve is telling Wayne when Eddie tunes back in, \u201cWhich seems lame, but it\u2019s like, my favorite gift every year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie got me socks this year!\u201d Wayne says, his voice gravelly from years of smoking. </p>\n<p>\u201cI got you more than just socks!\u201d Eddie finally jumps in. He feels someone\u2019s foot knock against his under the table. Then, two ankles hook around one of his. He cuts his gaze to Steve, who is contently sipping his spiked hot chocolate. His lips are turned up like a kitten\u2019s mouth. <i>Fuck</i>. Eddie turns away, tries to get back to what he had been saying before. \u201cI got him tickets to a Yankees game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love baseball,\u201d Steve says, eyebrows raising. \u201cSox fan, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wayne growls goodnaturedly at Steve\u2019s choice of team. \u201cWe should go together. Eddie is the lousiest company at a game.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true. Eddie gets bored incredibly quickly and starts fidgeting. Usually, he gets up and starts exploring the arena. Or the gift shop. Or he gets lost looking for the restrooms. It\u2019s something Wayne loves, though, so he tries to go with him when he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve\u2019s ankles squeeze Eddie\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d be doing us both a favor,\u201d Wayne says, sending a playful wink to Eddie. \u201cEddie doesn\u2019t have to pretend he cares about sports, and I get to argue with someone in the stands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve snorts. The coldness of his jeans seeps through Eddie\u2019s thin pajama pants. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go with you. Thanks,\u201d he adds in a softer voice, face suddenly warm with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the idea of Steve hanging out with his family, <i>without him</i>, like maybe Steve is a part of his family, makes Eddie\u2019s blood rush through his veins. Up and down and out, resulting in jitters. He taps his fingertips on the tabletop. </p>\n<p>Wayne leaves after an hour of sobering up in front of the television, and Eddie waits until he gets the call that his uncle is home safe and sound before he grabs the present he has been hiding in his closet the majority of this month.</p>\n<p>Steve has showered. He\u2019s in candy cane striped boxers and the ugliest sweater Eddie has ever seen, wiping down the counters and humming along to the radio. \u201cCan we get drunk tonight, Eds?\u201d He asks, not looking up.</p>\n<p>Eddie wonders how Steve knew he was in the room. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever been around a drunk Steve. Tipsy, sure. High as hell, definitely. But being drunk is something Steve adamantly avoids, for whatever reason. So Eddie jumps at the idea. He gets cozy on the couch, his t-shirt and boxers way too summer-y of an outfit for the chill of the apartment. He grabs the fluffy blanket Steve usually wraps around himself in the evening. It smells like the floral lotion he always applies before bed. He wraps himself in the feeling of Steve, leaving the present on the coffee table in favor of the remote. \u201cCan we watch videos of those rich British kids who get like a million gifts for Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d Steve brings over their mugs, now refilled with hot chocolate and topped with fluffy whipped cream. \u201cI put Bailey\u2019s in it,\u201d he says. \u201cLike <i>a lot</i> of Bailey\u2019s\u2013 What\u2019s that? Did Wayne forget a gift?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s for you,\u201d Eddie says. He hugs his mug close to his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe did presents this morning,\u201d Steve says, brows furrowed. And it\u2019s true, they agreed to do small presents, and Eddie made Steve a little stocking full of random shit he\u2019d picked up throughout the year. Steve had given Eddie three different vintage t-shirts, one of which Eddie is wearing right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but I was nervous about this one,\u201d Eddie chuckles. He places his mug on the table and gestures for Steve to open it.</p>\n<p>Steve gives him a strange look and grabs the wrapped package. He tears the paper slowly, unaware that the anticipation is killing Eddie. He opens the box, \u201cOh, Eddie\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re citrus,\u201d Eddie is quick to explain the gift, unsure whether or not Steve\u2019s expression is a good one. \u201cI made them myself because I wanted to make ones that would help soothe your muscles but they all spelled like shit so I got some citrus oils and\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve falls on top of him in a clumsy sort of hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is so thoughtful, Eddie.\u201d </p>\n<p>Once Steve climbs on top of Eddie, he stays there, curled under his arm. They get drunk and watch videos of families opening presents, commenting randomly on which presents they would\u2019ve enjoyed as a kid.</p>\n<p>Steve gets up to refill his mug. He comes back from the kitchen, cheeks red, and says, \u201cI just had two shots of vodka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Without me?\u201d Eddie doesn't have time to get up and try to stay level with Steve, because Steve tucks himself back into Eddie\u2019s side and unpauses the television. </p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s better this way. Maybe Eddie should stay partially sober, if just to take care of Steve. </p>\n<p>While Steve drinks his cocoa and giggles at the television, Eddie ponders how far they\u2019ve come. How much Steve seems to trust him. It simmers inside of him, warm and gooey, and Eddie lets the feeling rest there, right next to Steve\u2019s elbow in his side. He can\u2019t be bothered to ask him to move. Somehow the discomfort feels grounding, feels like the constant reminder that Steve chose to sit next to him. </p>\n<p>They fall asleep, drunk and giggly, the blue reflection of the television falling over them like moonlight.</p>\n<p>Steve holds himself in his sleep.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s something Eddie has noticed, after nights of falling asleep beside the man. Maybe it\u2019s one of Steve\u2019s boundaries, to keep his hands to himself. Maybe it\u2019s his way of avoiding any awkward touching during the night.</p>\n<p>Eddie wouldn\u2019t mind awkward touching, he decides. He likes any brief contact with Steve; even if it only takes place in drunken cuddles on the couch. Eddie tries to convince himself that he doesn\u2019t want something more purposeful, more intentional. That he doesn\u2019t wish Steve would fall asleep tucked up into his chest, instead of curled away from him.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the back of his mind, Eddie knows that Steve doesn\u2019t get the affection he needs. He\u2019s overworked, he\u2019s constantly tired, <i>constantly hurt</i>, and Eddie actually has no idea if Steve has even been held in his sleep or otherwise, apart from the aforementioned drunkenness. </p>\n<p>If he has to get drunk to initiate affection, Eddie wonders why. Why does Steve lock himself in this invisible barrier, warding loved ones away? Eddie wracks his mind for a memory of Steve hugging someone. Anyone. His mom, Robin, Dustin\u2026 but he comes up empty.</p>\n<p>And so the realization that Steve falls asleep with one arm wrapped around himself, hand squished between his body and the mattress, leaves Eddie with want.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always <i>want</i> with Steve. There\u2019s never a <i>get</i>.</p>\n<p>Which is fine! It\u2019s always fine! Except Eddie feels somewhat protective over Steve, his feelings for the man morphing into a vigilance, where he hovers a bit too long, stares a bit too hard, and tries to figure out what Steve needs from him. What Steve isn\u2019t asking for.</p>\n<p>He should just mind his own business, but it\u2019s hard, because Steve also frowns in his sleep. Huffs through his nose and makes frightened noises, still and calm but tense and wound up, like all the tension in his body has decided it\u2019s ready to snap. The anticipation builds and builds until Steve wakes with a shout, often escaping to his own room to complete the night before Eddie can ask any embarrassing questions.</p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t need to ask questions because overthinking answers the majority of them anyway. He knows Steve must have nightmares about whatever secrets he hides, about whoever hurts him so often, about the blood and the bruises and the scars. </p>\n<p>All the things he never tells Eddie about.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve gets New Year\u2019s Eve patrol. Mostly because he\u2019s a seasoned veteran with big crowds \u2014 Robin and Lucas still get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of people in New York. Also this year, Robin actually has a party to go to, and she\u2019s excited about it, so Steve had refused to let her abandon her plans in order to keep him company.</p>\n<p>Lucas had confessed with an embarrassed smile that he\u2019s going to ring in the new year with Max \u2014 maybe try to kiss her as the ball drops.</p>\n<p>And, well, Steve had forgotten about the whole New Year\u2019s Eve kiss tradition \u2014 that if you kiss someone at midnight, they\u2019ll be yours forever. It\u2019s a total superstition, a giant slap in science\u2019s face, but stranger things have happened (ahem\u2026 spider powers, anyone?) so Steve lets himself think about it. About kissing someone at midnight.</p>\n<p>Icy rain pelts the city. Despite the horrific weather, the celebrations don\u2019t die down, and Steve perches in his gargoyle way atop buildings and street lamps, hovering over drunken college students like a guardian angel. He\u2019s glad he chose today to test his nearly-perfected suit heaters, because the icy sheets would chill him to the bone otherwise. It\u2019s the kind of cold that lingers, leaves goosebumps and red noses behind. White frost out of people\u2019s mouths like engine exhaust, hot and cold meeting once again, painting the city a foggy, dreary gray.</p>\n<p>Steve spends the majority of his patrol walking people home and swinging over the giant crowd that have gathered for the festivities. He waves at a few broadcasting cameras, stops to catch his breath (read: watch Lewis Capaldi sing his heart out beneath the giant ball), and stops to talk to a few kids. He even stops to do an interview, using his voice mechanism for someone other than Eddie, and answers weird questions about Spidey\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolutions. </p>\n<p>And because he passed an irish pub a few minutes ago, where they handed him a class of Guinness, and another, and another, while he took shelter during a particularly painful downpour, he\u2019s just a tinsy bit drunk. Something Steve has realized, is that when he\u2019s drunk, all he wants to do is see Eddie.</p>\n<p>So he swings clumsily towards the fire escape, where he knows Eddie will be stubbornly bundled up beneath his makeshift awning (a large umbrella jammed into the staircase rungs above him) shivering as he struggles to light a joint.</p>\n<p>Steve swears half the man\u2019s paychecks go to drugs. </p>\n<p>He does a weak tumble onto the fire escape, his drunken mind daring him to <i>impress Eddie</i>. Which doesn\u2019t work, thanks, because a drunken tumble looks like a sober somersault, childish and silly. </p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s laugh pierces the air. Steve is sure he would hear it even if he didn\u2019t have any spidey sense \u2014 that behind the white noise of the rain, the loud jeers and cheers of the crowd, Steve would find Eddie\u2019s laugh with little difficulty. Just because he likes it that much. <i>Yes, that\u2019s scientifically sound.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say you\u2019re falling for me, Spidey,\u201d Eddie says, shouting to be heard over the rain.</p>\n<p>The heaters are miracle workers, because Steve can feel his hands, which is all he needs to push himself onto his feet. \u201cHardy har.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo minutes till midnight,\u201d Eddie says, voice quieting as the rain slows. \u201cGot any resolutions?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is drunk. A little loopy, a little in love. Sober Steve knows he shouldn\u2019t flirt with Eddie while he\u2019s wearing the suit \u2014 it only complicates things for the two of them. But Sober Steve can\u2019t come to the phone right now, so, \u201cI need to kiss someone at midnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie\u2019s skin glows orange from the street lamps, but Steve still catches a telltale pink. <i>Just for him.</i> \u201cGot anyone in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve hears the city roar with the minute countdown, a cacophony of jeers, like cicadas in their trees. Just to fuck with Eddie, he shoots his web at the railing above. \u201cAnd I need to go see them before I miss the countdown.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s shitty, the satisfaction he gets from Eddie\u2019s confused face. Steve waits until the city gets to <i>ten, nine, eight</i>, and he\u2019s dropping down slowly, upside down on his taut web, reappearing in front of Eddie. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie laughs. The city roars. Rain pelts at them from all sides. Steve feels his mask roll up \u2014 or rather, down \u2014 Eddie\u2019s numb fingers, icy shards against his now-bare chin. <i>Three, two, one</i>, and Eddie is kissing him. </p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t shaved in days. Steve knows because he gets distracted often by the dark shadow appearing along Eddie\u2019s jaw. It feels good now. Like the soft side of Velcro. Eddie\u2019s big hands \u2014 his pretty hands \u2014 hold Steve\u2019s face, leaving Steve to hang there completely frozen, completely enamored, and Eddie kisses like he\u2019s trying to memorize the taste of the moment. His warm tongue runs along the seam of Steve\u2019s closed lips, and Steve gasps, exhales one hot breath in exchange for Eddie\u2019s. It\u2019s a give and take in the best way. Rain falls between their mouths. It\u2019s wet, and cold, and Steve thinks he\u2019s going to drown if he doesn\u2019t right himself soon.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s addicting, the warmth of Eddie\u2019s mouth as it molds against Steve\u2019s. Eddie makes Steve shiver more than the winter ever could. The city celebrates the beginning of a new year, glitter and streamers and kisses and alcohol\u2026</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Steve feels the love of the city in his bones. These are his people. These are the people he would die to protect, and he knows they have his back in a way no one else does. </p>\n<p>He thinks of civilians defending his honor in the streets, helping him when he struggles\u2026 he thinks of the time his mask got ripped off his face and the entire group of people who saw his face vowed to keep it a secret. He thinks of the solidarity \u2014 of the way he is always called before the cops are. Because the people trust him. They love him.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when the entire city comes together like this, Steve feels in his heart that he is content. He knows who he\u2019s fighting for. He knows his city, he loves his city.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s kissing a beautiful boy on his fire escape, and the city is cheering.</p>\n<p>It feels like they\u2019re cheering for him.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Lucas finds a cat on one of his patrols. He brings it to their training warehouse, spends the entire time crafting a little mask for it, and creatively dubs the creature Spider-Cat. </p>\n<p>This is relevant, because, well, Steve might be allergic to cats. He never knew this, being someone who grew up without cats, but now as he steps into his apartment, he finds that his skin is still itchy even after the walk home, and his sinuses feel like they\u2019ve been stuffed with cotton.</p>\n<p>He digs through the medicine cabinet and eventually finds some allergy meds. He texts Lucas a picture of his watery eyes, accuses him of attempted spideycide, and then downs the medicine with a glass of water. </p>\n<p>Steve has been going through life with absolutely no health insurance, and he\u2019s not about to start now, so he really hopes this is the kind of allergy that dies down on its own.</p>\n<p>He must look pitiful, because Eddie takes one look at him and orders miso soup from Steve\u2019s favorite takeout place. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Steve says, but his nose is stuffed, so he doesn\u2019t sound convincing at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever seen you sick,\u201d Eddie says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sick,\u201d Steve pouts. \u201cToday I found out I am allergic to cats.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie suddenly looks forlorn. \u201cThat sucks, man. Cats are like, the cuddliest little guys in the entire world. And when they purr\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot helping,\u201d Steve says, passing a glare to Eddie because fuck, he usually doesn\u2019t think about it, but now that he knows he can\u2019t have a cat, it\u2019s all he wants. Now he\u2019ll never know what it feels like to have a cat fall asleep in his lap, the way they do in cartoons and children\u2019s books.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, are you crying?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve mumbles. He blinks, and a tear runs down his cheek. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, sweetheart,\u201d Eddie cooes at him like he\u2019s a child, and it\u2019s embarrassing how much Steve likes the attention. Eddie soothes his palms over Steve\u2019s cheeks, and Steve wants to kiss him but he can\u2019t, because he\u2019s snot-nosed over this new no-cat revelation, and Eddie kisses Spider-Man, not Steve. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddie is taking this way too seriously, which makes Steve fall for him even more if that\u2019s possible. Damn him. \u201cWe can get one of those hairless cats. You know, the ones that look like Smeagol?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve laughs. He paws at his eyes in a childish attempt to salvage his dignity. \u201cHairless cats scare me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Eddie whispers with a dramatic sigh of relief. His eyes are wide and wolfish, dark and clear. \u201cOh, thank God. I <i>really</i> don\u2019t want to live with Smeagol.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie is taking a tolerance break. It\u2019s less of a resolution and more of a money-needs-to-go-to-other-things decision. Wayne\u2019s car breaks down and Eddie sends him some money to fix it. He puts a little extra in savings, because he can, and decides to spoil himself by buying more of his shampoo so he doesn\u2019t have to bang the bottle against the wall every night just to get a decent conditioning.</p>\n<p>His hands shake \u2014 just a little. He thinks maybe he\u2019s too dependent sometimes, on the weed and the nicotine and all the other shit he sticks in his body without a care. It gets worse around winter, but only because Eddie gets this seasonal depression that lays over his shoulders like a heavy coat.</p>\n<p>He has never been able to shake it. Even when he celebrates Halloween. Even when he floods his brain with happy Christmas songs. Even when he gets a warm drink and snuggles into the couch. It\u2019s still there, lingering like a shadow in the corner of the room. Until tasks seem impossible, and his feet feel like weights, stuck to the floor. </p>\n<p>Steve works longer hours than Eddie does. He stays out longer. These days, he seems to have a permanent blush on his cheeks, face raw from both the constant bite of the cold and his lack of a proper skincare regime. But it all seems so normal to him. Like, yeah, he complains to Eddie about the lab, and Dustin, and Jameson\u2019s weird emails, but he doesn\u2019t seem to struggle the way Eddie does.</p>\n<p>Sometimes just wearing his nametag makes Eddie\u2019s heart race. It\u2019s so neurotic he sometimes thinks of calling his doctor, of asking for some kind of medication \u2014 something that will wash these strange moods away. Because he\u2019s got a good job, and good friends, and a good home, and he shouldn\u2019t be sad. But he is.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <i>so fucking</i> sad, and the only thing that numbs it seem to be things that are bad for him. As good as a tolerance break probably is for his body, it\u2019s eating at his mind, shame for having the addiction mixing with the aforementioned melancholy, producing a cocktail of guilt. </p>\n<p>He feels stupid, clicking the button on the doohickey. For reaching out in the darkness for some masked man who won\u2019t reveal himself to Eddie, despite their budding <i>whatever it is</i> that leaves Eddie feeling somewhat whole, like maybe he can crawl out of this funk, eventually. </p>\n<p>It's different \u2014 liking Spider-Man. As in, it\u2019s not the way he feels about Steve. It\u2019s not that deep in-his-veins love that makes him want to be around Steve forever. But it could become that, maybe, one day. Eddie imagines he\u2019ll have to get over Steve eventually, he\u2019ll have to accept his loss and move on. Who better to move on with than Spider-Man?</p>\n<p>He sighs. White breath fading into the blue winter night. Who is he kidding? <i>No one will ever compare to Steve. No one even comes close.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Eddie. You okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie glances at the superhero, falling into the seat beside him like he belongs there. He wonders where he lives; if Spidey has someone to go home to. If he has a place he can go for safety. If he\u2019s okay \u2014 the civilian behind the mask. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says after a breath. Spider-Man\u2019s shoulder is warm, so he presses into it \u2014 leeches off the heat. \u201cJust wanted company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Spider-Man shakes his head, gestures vaguely to his nose, his eye lenses narrowing. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just allergies.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Steve has allergies,</i> Eddie thinks to himself unhelpfully. He huffs. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get Steve out of his head, let alone his fucking heart. </p>\n<p>Wait. <i>Steve has allergies</i></p>\n<p>This used to happen in school. Eddie would be given the problem, and the answer would be right there\u2026 at the tip of his tongue\u2026 but he could never quite write it down. As if some part of him is really smart, really intuitive, but the rest of him refuses to cooperate. It\u2019s the reason he had to repeat senior year. It\u2019s the reason he sucks at communicating. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s all he can think about right now, as Spider-Man chatters needlessly about some cat he saved from a tree. He\u2019s sniffling as he says it. That nettling feeling is back, clawing up his temples, alarm bells in his head, like <i>just think, Eddie. Just fucking think</i>.</p>\n<p>God, he needs weed. He can think better when he\u2019s high. Because right now, his mind is trying to tell him something, and it feels like his thoughts are in another language entirely. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Spider-Man stops his recap of the day. \u201cYou\u2019re abnormally quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThinkin\u2019,\u201d Eddie mumbles. His toes are numb. His fingers are numb. He wants to talk, but he can\u2019t find the words. Like he\u2019s caged in. Like if he speaks, it will come out as gibberish. </p>\n<p>Spider-Man has got a red scarf wrapped around his neck. A matching hat over his mask. It\u2019s comedically adorable, but the color bleeds into Eddie\u2019s head. A sense of deja vu. He\u2019s been here before. In another time, with someone else, he just can\u2019t pick the memory out. It\u2019s drowning in all of the other ones, falling falling falling, and Eddie\u2019s arms aren\u2019t long enough to reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk,\u201d Spider-Man says, gentleness noticeable even with the voice mechanism. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to overwhelm you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie nods. He wants to thank him, but he can\u2019t form the words. </p>\n<p>He drops his head onto Spider-Man\u2019s shoulder; hopes the sentiment translates.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel underdressed,\u201d Eddie whispers to Steve. He went directly to the lab after work (a <i>very</i> early morning shift) which leaves him in blue jeans and a black button up. It could be worse, but when Eddie sees all the men in suits surrounding him, he finds himself shrinking just a little.</p>\n<p>Steve places his hand on Eddie\u2019s shoulder; a grounding weight. \u201cThose are investors,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou\u2019re my guest, so you can wear whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a presentation hosted by Steve\u2019s boss, Dr. Otto Octavius. Steve explained the process days ago, when he first invited Eddie. How the scientists will show their prototypes to investors in the hopes that someone will fund their project. </p>\n<p>(\u201cOh, like Shark Tank?\u201d Eddie had asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly like Shark Tank,\u201d Steve had laughed, eyes like heavy caramel.)</p>\n<p>Steve has a prototype to show, too, but he\u2019s the last on the list, being the newest hire. And Eddie doesn\u2019t mind walking through the lab with a bunch of smelly businessmen (smelly in the moral sense, as their colognes are rather pleasant.) He can\u2019t say he\u2019s paying much attention, though, because he\u2019s too busy focusing on Steve\u2019s touch; on the way Steve leans in when he wants to say something. How Steve laughs at nerdy jokes his peers make and how he explains the punchline to Eddie immediately after.</p>\n<p>The lab smells off putting; the way a kitchen smells when foil is accidentally placed in the microwave. It makes Eddie wrinkle his nose more than once. He wonders why they don\u2019t have more open windows in this place. Maybe they don\u2019t notice, as they\u2019re all constantly surrounded by weird machinery.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s Dr. Octavius\u2019!\u201d Steve whispers to him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be so impressed, Eds.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Eds.</i> Eddie nearly misses the entire introduction because of that nickname alone. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026The idea\u2026\u201d Dr. Octavius is saying, \u201c\u2026is that this could be used by those suffering from paralysis. Obviously, we could have the limbs modified to look more aesthetically pleasing, but that is the type of thing I would change with funding.\u201d</p>\n<p>The businessmen around them are asking questions about the large mechanical limbs that hook up to a device one can have implanted along their spinal cord all the way up to their cerebellum. It\u2019s a bit surreal, to see how technology and biology blend together. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs you can see\u2013\u201d Dr. Octavius turns around, and gestures to the green patch on his neck, hooked with wires that lead to the arms, limp in their restraints behind him. \u201c\u2013this is only a temporary connector. A surgical procedure would be recommended for a long-term prosthetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of science-y talk. Eddie was never really good at school, even when he knew what they were talking about. So he\u2019s a bit lost here, but he gathers as much as he can, reads the context clues and realizes that the men are asking for a demonstration.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t tested\u2013\u201d Dr. Octavius is saying, but he\u2019s rudely interrupted by one of the businessmen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we invest in something if we can\u2019t see how it works?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Octavius\u2019 face flushes. \u201cO-Okay. Give me a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve tenses beside Eddie, leans in, chest to shoulder, says, \u201cLast time we tested it, it malfunctioned. We can\u2019t test it today.\u201d He breaks away from the crowd and Eddie watches him whisper something to Dr. Octavius. It\u2019s clear that Steve is hesitant about the project, while Dr. Octavius doesn\u2019t want to let the investors down. </p>\n<p>Dr. Octavius laughs, loud and forced, and wraps his arm around Steve\u2019s shoulders. \u201cNew hire,\u201d he says to the crowd, gesturing to Steve, \u201cThey\u2019re always so worried about everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd laughs. Steve recoils. His face flashes, something tense and leveled. Like he\u2019s holding back. Like he wants to run.</p>\n<p>Eddie wants to run too. Wants to shout <i>he\u2019s trying to help out, fuck you!</i> but something tells him Steve wouldn\u2019t appreciate that. So he just watches it play out.</p>\n<p>Dr. Octavius connects the wires on the patch to the mainframe strapped onto his back. Something sizzles almost immediately, and Eddie can now identify that aforementioned microwave scent. </p>\n<p>The arms, long metal protrusions reminiscent of vacuum hoses ending in three-pronged claws, lift off of their base. Two plant themselves into the floor of the lab. The linoleum cracks. Dr. Octavius lifts a few inches off of the floor, supported by the two bottom limbs, while the two on top whir and spin, snapping their claws at the investors. \u201cHow\u2019s this for a demonstration?\u201d The scientist all but cackles. </p>\n<p>Steve steps down and away. He stands by Eddie\u2019s side, his body even more tense. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like he knows. Steve has always had super fast reflexes, but the foresight must be new, because Steve grabs Eddie\u2019s hand and yanks him behind him, just in time for one of the arms to start sparking. </p>\n<p>Dr. Octavius ignores this, and continues to use the limbs to carry him closer towards the investors. </p>\n<p>Steve pushes Eddie back. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why\u2013\u201d The mechanism explodes, more or less. Two of the arms snap off of the base, and yet still move, whipping against the walls of the lab before they finally crash to the ground, two limp and twitching hunks of metal. </p>\n<p>Dr. Octavius shouts in pain. Electrical burns are visible now on his shoulders, his clothes having ripped somewhat significantly. \u201cTurn it off!\u201d He yells. \u201cTurn it off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home!\u201d Steve says to Eddie, eyes so serious that Eddie doesn\u2019t even think to argue with him. He doesn\u2019t ask why Steve won\u2019t run out with him. He just follows the frightened investors and the other lab employees as the race for safety. </p>\n<p>Eddie catches the brief sight of Steve running to his boss just before he\u2019s pulled out of the building.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The lab fire garners some media attention.</p>\n<p>Though Steve successfully triggered the failsafe and got both him and Dr. Octavius safely out of the lab, the arms continued to spark, and soon a burst of flames took on the building. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Fuck. A lot of his suit blueprints are in there.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Steve leaves as soon as the newscasters arrive. He\u2019s got enough shit to deal with now \u2014 the last thing he needs is to be linked to these fires. He figures Dr. Octavius got himself into this mess, anyway, so he can get himself out.</p>\n<p>He arrives home to find Eddie pacing back and forth in their living room, biting at his nails. He\u2019s so busy muttering to himself, he doesn\u2019t hear the door open.</p>\n<p>Steve closes the door behind him. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie tackles him, essentially. Wraps his lean arms around Steve\u2019s neck and squeezes. \u201cI was so fucking scared. I tried to stay but once the firefighters got there they made me come home. I tried to call Spider-Man, but he didn\u2019t fucking answer\u2013\u201d His breath is shaky; Steve can feel the shudder in Eddie\u2019s chest. The cold sweat on his temples. The practically pungent fear that smothers the apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou called Spider-Man for me?\u201d Steve reminds himself briefly that Eddie has never even mentioned his relationship to Spider-Man with Steve. Maybe out of respect for his secret identity, or maybe because he and Steve aren\u2019t close in that way\u2026 Steve doesn\u2019t know, but the idea of Eddie releasing the information now, in a rushed confession, makes his stomach furl and unfurl. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t answer,\u201d Eddie says again, angrily. \u201cGod, Steve, if anything had happened to you\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013it wouldn\u2019t have been Spider-Man\u2019s fault,\u201d Steve says, suddenly feeling the need to defend himself. He places his palms flat on Eddie\u2019s chest and pushes him away. \u201cHe can\u2019t be everywhere at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie retorts, petulant. He toes the frayed carpet, eyes downcast. \u201cFuck. I wish I was Spider-Man. I would\u2019ve rescued you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would\u2019ve rescued you,\u201d Eddie repeats, and there\u2019s a glimmer in his eyes that leaves no room for argument.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Steve wants to place his determination in a ring with Eddie\u2019s; wants to make them fight to the death \u2014 see if Eddie could hold his own against Steve\u2019s fierce protection for him. Protection he couldn\u2019t even fathom. Because Spider-Man did save Steve. Because he is Steve. And Eddie has no fucking idea. He laughs, suddenly thrilled that Eddie is mad at Spider-Man. In Steve\u2019s own defense, no less. </p>\n<p>Eddie seems surprised that Steve isn\u2019t fighting back. He raises his eyebrows, opens his mouth, closes it, looks away. And then, \u201cOh. Okay. Good. I\u2019m glad that you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cGood.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\u201cGood.\u201d</i>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Lucas comes over to the apartment with his now-girlfriend, Max.</p>\n<p>They bring enough takeout sushi to feed an army, which Eddie finds funny, since it\u2019s just the three of them in the living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want some, man?\u201d Steve asks, holding up a tempura roll. </p>\n<p>The three of them have committed to watching a season of Below Deck, which is a show about yachting, Eddie has come to figure out. He\u2019s pretty sure Chrissy has talked about it before.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s supposed to be decluttering the kitchen \u2014 something he tries to get done every January. New start and all that. His mixing tools are everywhere, ready to be scrubbed clean and dried before they inevitably get forgotten until Eddie decides he wants to impress someone with his mediocre skills.</p>\n<p>The only person he wants to impress is Steve, who hardly drinks. So into the drawer they go.</p>\n<p>He forgot to answer Steve on account of being too busy thinking about Steve, so he\u2019s startled when the man taps him on the shoulder and offers him a plate of assorted sushi. \u201cHey, take a break. You\u2019ve been organizing all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThree. Did you have lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie scrunches his nose. The last thing he had was a bowl of cereal for breakfast. \u201cMust\u2019ve skipped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEat with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make room for you,\u201d Steve says, nudging him with the plate again. \u201cGo sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie curls up on the couch, munches on sashimi while Lucas and Max give him a rundown of the show and all the drama that has happened so far. </p>\n<p>When Steve returns, he places a glass of water on the coffee table in front of Eddie, \u201cHere, Eds.\u201d He sits beside him on the loveseat, their thighs touching. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Max pauses the television and faces them suddenly, her brows furrowed, her eyes narrowed. </p>\n<p>(Eddie gets the faint idea he\u2019s about to be read from the inside out.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you two been together?\u201d</p>\n<p>(He\u2019s right.)</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Steve\u2019s eyes are wide, almost comically so. \u201cUh\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMax!\u201d Lucas looks embarrassed. \u201cI told you they\u2019re not together!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie takes a nervous sip of water. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d Steve is bright red. He\u2019s avoiding Eddie\u2019s gaze, though Eddie doesn\u2019t know why, because he\u2019s the one with the unfortunate crush: he\u2019s the one who should be embarrassed by this conversation. \u201cFriends.\u201d Steve clears his throat. He moves away suddenly, so that his leg is no longer touching Eddie\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Okay. That hurts. Eddie thought they were fine with physical touch. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s just a question. It doesn\u2019t bother Eddie, so it shouldn\u2019t bother Steve, right? </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry\u2026\u201d Max says, but she doesn\u2019t look sorry at all. She looks like the cat who got the cream. There\u2019s a slow smile growing on her face. \u201cSo\u2026 Why aren\u2019t you two together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie blinks at her. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends..?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is tense beside him. Eddie doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just a question, right? Maybe a teasing jab at their singleness, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. </p>\n<p>\n<i>Right?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Lucas clears his throat, breaking the tension in the room. \u201cAnyway, Spider-Cat is settling in nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Max groans, throwing her head back in annoyance. \u201cThere\u2019s cat fur everywhere!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Spider-Cat?\u201d Eddie asks. He takes another bite of sushi. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018S a Cat I found,\u201d Lucas mumbles around his own roll. \u201cHe\u2019s super sweet. And don\u2019t listen to Max. She loves him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t allergic,\u201d Steve mumbles, forlorn. \u201cI want a cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie pats him on the knee, supportive. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a turtle or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Turtle,\u201d Max snorts.</p>\n<p>Steve laughs, shaking his head. \u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie listens to them jest, using a joke that is supposed to go completely over his head. Only it doesn\u2019t, because Eddie has been thinking about things for awhile now, ever since Steve and Spider-Man both came to him with the same allergies. </p>\n<p>It sounds crazy, even in his head, so he doesn\u2019t dare say anything aloud. </p>\n<p>Because maybe it\u2019s just delusional thinking. Maybe it\u2019s just want. Maybe it would just be easier if his theory were true: he wouldn\u2019t have to choose.</p>\n<p>Eddie eventually gets back to organizing the kitchen. He wishes he could organize his thoughts as well.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever fucked up this badly in his life.</p>\n<p>He had assumed the entire lab had been burned to the ground, based on the damage report spread across the news. He should\u2019ve checked for himself; he <i>always</i> checks for himself.</p>\n<p>His locked lab room had a lot of Spidey stuff in it. Way too much for Steve to just leave without checking. </p>\n<p>And now Dr. Octavius is handing him a box filled with salvaged Spider-things, and Steve can\u2019t hide. There\u2019s no way to explain his way out of this one, and it\u2019s nothing but fear washing over him as Otto opens his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour secret is safe with me,\u201d is all the scientist says. The skin of his neck and cheeks are splattered with scars from the electrical burn. \u201cI have to say,\u201d he grins, not even persuaded, \u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of fantasies when it comes to Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve can\u2019t help his startled face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does it all work?\u201d Dr. Octavius has an excited gleam in his eyes, and Steve isn\u2019t sure what to do. \u201cI assume you\u2019re Spider-Man\u2019s employee, right? You design the suits and stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. <i>Oh.</i> \u201cYes!\u201d Steve says, and it\u2019s so much easier to lie. To keep the truth far away. To make Spider-Man an unknown entity instead of the new hire that is Steve Harrington. \u201cYeah, well, I photograph him too. Spidey and I go <i>way</i> back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFascinating!\u201d Dr. Octavius peers into the box that Steve is now holding. \u201cI would love to work with him. I often think my arm design would help him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen he\u2019d actually have eight limbs,\u201d Steve jokes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Dr. Octavius says. He seems to think Steve <i>isn\u2019t</i> joking, though, which might become a problem.</p>\n<p>Steve hopes it won\u2019t become a problem.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie is one of those people who celebrate Groundhog Day. Which is incredibly endearing to Steve, even if it means he has to get up on his day off to watch the morning news.</p>\n<p>He hates the news \u2014 he gets enough from the police scanner that consistently chatters in his room, or the alerts he gets sent from Dustin, who filters through crime reports to see which ones Steve should get to first. Any other day he would turn it off, but Eddie is on speaker phone with Wayne, because apparently it\u2019s a tradition to watch the groundhog special. So, Steve wraps himself in a blanket, munches on Cheerios, and listens to Eddie and his uncle argue on what will happen.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s nice to listen to them. To feel like a part of something so casual, so warm.</p>\n<p>Times like these, he really loves being Steve. One half of Steve and Eddie. </p>\n<p>When he\u2019s Spider-Man, he\u2019s fractured. He\u2019s one millionth part of a whole city. The job he does isn\u2019t just for him: it\u2019s for thousands of other lives who depend on him. He\u2019s got to think about them.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s Steve, he doesn\u2019t have to think about anything. Nothing but him and Eddie; and nowadays, Eddie is as much of Steve as he is of himself. Making space for Eddie is as easy as breathing. As effortless, too. </p>\n<p>He knows Eddie likes Spider-Man. Maybe more than Steve. Definitely more than Steve, if the kisses and the <i>we\u2019re just friends</i> mean anything. Eddie has kept a distance with Steve that he doesn\u2019t keep with Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>So\u2026 Steve knows where he stands. </p>\n<p>He thinks he\u2019ll take Eddie however he can have him: friend or lover. Both is good, but both won\u2019t last. Eventually, karma is going to tackle Steve to the ground \u2014 Eddie\u2019s gonna find out. And depending on how it goes down, Steve may lose Eddie for good: his trust, his friendship, everything. </p>\n<p>He leaves the empty cereal bowl on the coffee table, lays back and curls into Eddie\u2019s shoulder. Maybe he can get some shuteye during this whole groundhog thing. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe interrupt this morning broadcast to bring you live footage from midtown, where it appears a man with large robotic limbs is throwing cars at civilians\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve bolts up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your boss?\u201d Eddie says. \u201cThe one who burned the lab down?.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d Steve watches the footage in a near-trance. Dr. Octavius has arms that are somehow bigger; longer; more dexterous. The bottom two are walking him through the streets, while the top two twist and snap at any passersby. He\u2019s saying something, but there isn\u2019t a mic to pick it up. \u201cWhat the fuck is he doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHas he gone crazy?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve stands up. \u201cI need to go. I need to go check on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you going to talk to him?\u201d Eddie asks, incredulous. \u201cHe\u2019s lurking around the city like a fucking octopus, Steve!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know!\u201d Steve hisses. \u201cI know, I just\u2013 Look, I\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>He locks the bedroom door behind him. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s in his suit and out on the street in minutes, his earpiece ringing with alerts and police chatter and a beeping that\u2019s definitely Eddie, but Steve doesn\u2019t have time to turn his earpiece off, let alone answer anyone. </p>\n<p>Adrenaline has been Steve\u2019s best friend for a while now. The rush, the thrill\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have time to be anxious about anything, because the short burst of energy he gets overrides it all. </p>\n<p>Which is why he doesn\u2019t have time to wonder why Dr. Octavius has a second set of robotic limbs, or why he\u2019s terrorizing midtown, or why he begins to cackle happily when he sees Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man! I knew you would come!\u201d One claw crushes into the sidewalk, uprooting cement. There\u2019s a helicopter somewhere overhead. </p>\n<p>Steve perches on a street lamp in an effort to get eye-level with his boss, who doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s Steve\u2019s boss. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining the city!\u201d </p>\n<p>Because this is Dr. Octavius. This is the scientist who spends his work days rambling about the state of New York, about the environment, about things Mayor Osborn could do better and yet\u2013 </p>\n<p>Yet here he is, turning the roads to crumble. And Steve doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to get your attention!\u201d Dr. Octavius is shouting to be heard over all the noise of the choppers and the news stations and the cops that are pointing their guns at both of them now and <i>oh shit</i>, Steve\u2019s boss is about to die if he doesn\u2019t stand down immediately. \u201cI need to talk to you, Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Steve hisses. \u201cOkay. We can talk! We can talk! But you\u2019ve gotta stand down.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s another fucking chase. For some reason, people love chasing Spider-Man. Otto grabs him with his claws and carries him to a rooftop, squeezing all too tight to <i>not</i> leave a mark.</p>\n<p>Steve wishes they could just walk together, because he\u2019s pretty sure Dr. Octavius isn\u2019t an enemy, but he <i>is</i> an extremist. Most mad scientists are, hence the \u201cmad\u201d part, but their obsessions usually lie in good things, things that make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>The means of getting there\u2013 not so much.</p>\n<p>So here they stand, atop a flat apartment roof. Dr. Octavius releases Steve and stands on his own two feet, but the limbs stay alive, whirring at Steve in an almost threatening manner, snapping and hissing. There\u2019s still a helicopter, watching his every move.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need your help, Spider-Man.\u201d And Steve can see it now that he\u2019s up close: the thin sheen of sweat covering Dr. Octavius\u2019 face. The dark circles under his eyes. His swollen, burned face. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can help me. I had to make a scene\u2026 you see\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how else to contact you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Steve eyes the limbs warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried to fix my experiment\u2013 My limbs\u2013 at home. But the device is stuck. I can't get the patch off\u2013 I\u2019ve tried drowning it and burning it but nothing works. And now I can hear this\u2013 this voice in my head\u2013 It tells me I can do so much with these limbs, Spider-Man. I can <i>help</i> people.\u201d</p>\n<p>And there it is. Hubris always seems to get to these people before Steve can. Where hubris lingers, an ego death follows close behind, always nipping at the heels.</p>\n<p>Steve has to end this before it turns into something terrible.</p>\n<p>There have been times before when the inkling of a villain has appeared on Steve\u2019s radar. A man with too much power, the hopeful beginning of a tragic end. </p>\n<p>Curtis Connors comes to mind. He had come to Spider-Man too, in the beginning. Steve hadn\u2019t known then what he knows now. He hadn\u2019t heeded the warning; too excited for such a renowned professor to talk to him. Because Connors had been interested in lizard DNA, which of course is nothing close to spider DNA, but it was <i>something</i>.</p>\n<p>But Steve isn\u2019t immune to hubris either, so he had given too much information. He had helped Connors \u2014 though unknowingly \u2014 create that fucking serum. All kinds: lizards, wasps, ants\u2026 the spider one that Robin got injected with.</p>\n<p>So yeah, Steve feels a whole lot of responsibility when it comes to preventing these things.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got to be proactive, not just reactive. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s got to make sure no one gets hurt.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never got to show your prototype,\u201d Eddie says one day when the two of them are walking down the street. He\u2019s got a cup of pistachio gelato, topped with candied fruits and strawberry wafers. It would be picturesque, if either of them were the types to take pictures of their food. It makes Steve\u2019s own lemon gelato \u2014 no toppings \u2014 look lame in comparison. \u201cI was really looking forward to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And\u2026 oh, that\u2019s not what Steve expected him to say. He can barely remember his long-forgotten project, scorched by the electric fire. Some sort of failsafe for mechanical rides like trolleys and subways. Just a report; statistics and mathematics and a lot of other shit to dumb down for the men who would consider funding it. </p>\n<p>It hardly matters now; Steve\u2019s been far too busy with Dr. Octavius \u2014 \u201cOtto, call me Otto,\u201d he\u2019s been saying \u2014 to really focus on anything else.</p>\n<p>As far as they\u2019ve figured out, there\u2019s no way to disconnect the arms from Otto\u2019s cerebellum. The main tissues fused during the fire, and so Otto is stuck with four extra limbs, which could be considered a decent thing, if it weren\u2019t for the voices in Otto\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always fucking voices. Steve is pretty sure it\u2019s an excuse a majority of the time; that his enemies often say \u201cvoices\u201d when they just mean \u201cthoughts\u201d. </p>\n<p>So, he\u2019s been trying to help Otto. He\u2019s been wearing his suit to the new makeshift lab that\u2019s been set up in the basement of Otto\u2019s building. As long as Otto feels like he\u2019s helping Spider-Man, he fights against the arms and their robotic vendetta against the city.</p>\n<p>Steve wishes he got paid for all of this. It feels a lot like babysitting sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d he says. \u201cJust some plans for a failsafe device that would stop vehicles from crashing. Other versions have been made before. It\u2019s not like it was original or anything- I was just putting my own spin on it-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like when you do that,\u201d Eddie picks out a candied grape and hands it to Steve. He sucks on the pad of his thumb, lapping at the caramelized sugar that remains. Steve gets so distracted by watching him that he nearly misses what Eddie is saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like when you put your achievement down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve feels his ears go hot. \u201cIt\u2019s not an achievement, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in him really struggles to accept compliments. Or anything positive about himself. Maybe it\u2019s the superhero identity, but he doesn\u2019t allow himself room for mistakes. And it\u2019s not like he has the privilege to be proud of his accomplishments. He can\u2019t, because all it takes is one prideful moment, and someone will get hurt. He\u2019ll get careless. </p>\n<p>He supposes that ideology bleeds into his personal life. His personal accomplishments. But he doesn\u2019t know how to fix it. Doesn\u2019t know how to separate one part of himself from the other.</p>\n<p>Eddie shoves his shoulder against Steve\u2019s as they walk. His voice takes on a dramatic lilt, and he clutches Steve\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me here, Sweetheart.\u201d His breath, sweet and sugary, puffs against Steve\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re crazy for eating a frozen dessert in the middle of February. Steve is crazy for falling in love with his best friend. \u201cSorry,\u201d he breathes out. His teeth chatter. He drops his empty cup in a trashcan as they pass. \u201cForce of habit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can fix that,\u201d Eddie drops his own cup, though not empty, into the trash can. His cold palm cups the back of Steve\u2019s neck, pushing underneath his red scarf, sending a chill down his back that makes him jump away with a yelp.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Steve shoves him away.</p>\n<p>Eddie throws his head back. His laughter becomes a white mist in the winter air. He\u2019s so beautiful, feathery hair half-hidden beneath his beanie. The tip of his nose is red, his lips are chapped. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s perfect.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cBeginning to think you only visit me for the free weed,\u201d Eddie finds himself grumbling. And, okay, he\u2019s a little upset, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, and Eddie is one of those unfortunate people who actually like the holiday. He has this embarrassing fantasy of being wooed by someone, of being given a card and some flowers and some really shitty chocolates.</p>\n<p>He certainly doesn\u2019t expect anything this year. It\u2019s not like Steve knows about Eddie\u2019s feelings, and even if he did, the odds of returning them are slim to none. And he would consider Spider-Man, but he\u2019s only kissed the guy twice, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s something they talk about. It\u2019s just something they <i>do</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Spidey says. He sits beside Eddie as they pass a joint back and forth. \u201cI come for the company.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not much of a confession, but it gives Eddie butterflies nonetheless. He huffs. Doesn\u2019t want to give Spider-Man the recognition of knowing how affection-starved Eddie is sometimes.</p>\n<p>Especially on a day like today.</p>\n<p>Spidey has his mask rolled up. Two moles lay on his jaw, strikingly similar to the moles on Steve\u2019s own neck: the ones Eddie thinks of kissing more than is probably acceptable. He thinks briefly of all the freckles that litter Steve\u2019s skin, the constellations he\u2019s memorized during his brief bouts of getting to see his roommate shirtless. He\u2019s ninety percent sure if he peeled the suit off of Spider-Man, he\u2019d find those same constellations. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how to ask. Mostly because if he\u2019s wrong, he\u2019s going to look stupid. He\u2019s going to look like this entire time, he\u2019s been hoping that the man he\u2019s been kissing is Steve. Which is not true: he kissed Spider-Man way before he had any idea who might be under the mask.</p>\n<p>But it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? That secretive Steve, with his locked room and his knack for injuries and his odd disappearances that somehow always line up with Spidey appearances. The allergies. The blue jacket. The red scarf. The kiss that had tasted like white wine just minutes after Steve had finished a glass.</p>\n<p>Eddie thinks he knows now what he wanted to say on the balcony before, when his vocal chords failed him. He thinks he knew it then. He just hadn\u2019t been ready to believe it. </p>\n<p>Whereas now, if asked, Eddie would say it one hundred percent.</p>\n<p>He thinks Spider-Man might be Steve.</p>\n<p>He just has no idea how to tell him.</p>\n<p>(Eddie loses himself in his thoughts again. He does this a lot, when he\u2019s had too much to smoke. When he hasn\u2019t had enough to eat during the day. Usually Steve lets him sit, lets him process the day he\u2019s had. </p>\n<p>Steve is content to sit in the haze on most days. But today is a holiday, and Eddie, for some godforsaken reason, loves holidays. \u201cI got you something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie blinks at him. His lips curl into a shy grin, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing,\u201d Steve pulls the card out of his jacket pocket, passes it to Eddie. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the worst card he could find; one with his own superhero countenance on it. The basic font says <i>Stuck on You, Valentine!</i></p>\n<p>Eddie laughs, surprised. He wipes a hand down his face, exasperated, fond. If Steve pays enough attention, he can hear the way his breath catches when he looks at him. \u201cYou got me a Valentine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve wants to take off his mask. Wants to know if Eddie would smile at him the way he smiles at Spider-Man. If he would still let him kiss him. If it\u2019s selfish to think so. \u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie beams. He folds the Valentine and shoves it into his own pocket. \u201cHope you know I\u2019m keeping this forever.\u201d)</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>March brings bitter wind and a lot of pollen, but Spider-Man doesn\u2019t sniffle at all, the way he would if his allergies were seasonal. It\u2019s another clue Eddie keeps in his head, filed under <i>Steve-slash-Spidey Evidence.</i></p>\n<p>They put away the space heater and leave their windows open longer. Steve starts bringing home fruit from the farmer\u2019s market. He\u2019s also applying for different labs since his last one burned to the ground. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s complaining to Eddie about it now, his bright pink toothbrush sticking out of his mouth because he can\u2019t just rinse and then speak. He\u2019s got to talk right this instant, pacing Eddie\u2019s bedroom floor in nothing but his sweatpants, looking way too attractive than he should for someone who isn\u2019t even trying.</p>\n<p>Eddie gets a bit lost, mapping out the smooth planes of Steve\u2019s torso. The faint bruises and scars, chest hair that looks soft to the touch, his soft stomach that Eddie wants to reach out and touch, but he can\u2019t, so he just sits on his hands and tries to tune back into the conversation at hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno what\u2019s gonna happen with Otto,\u201d Steve mumbles about his toothbrush. He disappears into the bathroom and comes back, mouth now clean. \u201cI mean, getting Spider-Man involved? Are you kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie is staring at the dark bruises across Steve\u2019s back when he turns around. The way the shape is claw-like \u2014 a giant hand ripping him out of the sky. Does he even know he has it? Out of all of his bruises, how many does Steve just forget about? When does the pain become so normalized, he forgets to bandage himself? Take care of himself?</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you sit down?\u201d Eddie takes the cream out of his nightstand before Steve can ask. He applies it over the bruise as gently as he can, apologizing every time Steve shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d Steve asks, muscles tense. He glances over his shoulder. Eddie can see those two moles, like vampire bites, at the junction of his neck and his jaw. <i>Can you tell?</i> Eddie thinks Steve might be asking. <i>Have you figured it out yet?</i></p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to be safe,\u201d Eddie says. It\u2019s all he can say unless he feels like bringing up the elephant \u2014 ahem, spider \u2014 in the room. So he lends Steve a line, something neutral enough to mean anything. And maybe Steve knows that Eddie is figuring it out, and maybe he doesn\u2019t. All that matters is that he knows Eddie wants him safe. </p>\n<p>Eddie gets into bed before Steve.</p>\n<p>Steve checks the locks on all the windows and doors, before returning to Eddie\u2019s room and shutting off the light. \u201cYour room feels like home,\u201d he says it like it\u2019s a passing thought; something unimportant.</p>\n<p>Eddie is lying on his back, eyes on the ceiling he can\u2019t even see now that his light has been turned off. His window is the only one they leave open at night, a soft breeze rustles the curtains. Eddie is familiar with this routine: with Steve crawling underneath the covers and falling asleep beside him. </p>\n<p>What he isn\u2019t familiar with \u2014 what's never happened before \u2014 is the way Steve moves into Eddie\u2019s space. He\u2019s clumsy, knee pressing into Eddie\u2019s thigh. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers, \u201cThis okay?\u201d But as he asks, he plops onto Eddie\u2019s chest and wraps his arm around Eddie\u2019s stomach the way he usually holds himself. </p>\n<p>Eddie struggles to answer. Steve\u2019s hand is slipping underneath his t-shirt, clammy hand on soft skin. Maybe Steve is drunk? Because right now he\u2019s scratching at the band of Eddie\u2019s underwear. Does Sober Steve do that?</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie?\u201d His breath feels hot. Eddie thinks he might wake up with a boner tomorrow, and usually that isn\u2019t an issue, because <i>Steve doesn\u2019t do this.</i> He\u2019s never close enough to <i>know</i>. Sure, he\u2019s affectionate, but they\u2019re usually on the couch, not laying down, and they usually have some sort of barrier, like clothes, but right now Steve is pushing Eddie\u2019s shirt up, he\u2019s rubbing circles with the tough pad of his thumb. It\u2019s equal parts addicting and terrifying. If they wake up like this tomorrow, Eddie might combust. </p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yeah?\u201d Eddie swallows around nothing; finding his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Steve asks again. </p>\n<p>Eddie is thankful it\u2019s dark, because he\u2019s sure if the lights were on, Steve would be able to see Eddie\u2019s pinched face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he sighs, \u201cYou just never, um, you know, cuddle me..?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Somehow, Steve sounds nervous. He\u2019s still scratching Eddie\u2019s hip. It\u2019s not thrilling anymore\u2026 just soothing. \u201cI just need it tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Eddie says awkwardly. \u201cSorry if I\u2019m making it weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust relax.\u201d Steve chuckles. He squeezes Eddie\u2019s hip. \u201cYou\u2019re really tense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Eddie says again.</p>\n<p>Steve shuffles closer, if that\u2019s possible. He sticks his cold nose against Eddie\u2019s neck. As Eddie squirms away at the change in temperature, something warm follows, and it takes only a moment for Eddie to realize Steve just kissed him. Just a cheeky, apology kiss for his freezing nose, but it\u2019s enough for the tension in Eddie\u2019s body to release. </p>\n<p>Somehow, sleep finds them both quickly after that. It\u2019s the best sleep Eddie\u2019s had in ages.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of benefits to being Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>At first, Steve had only cared about the physical, as any teenage boy does. After the bite, everything somehow became bigger. Muscles Steve didn\u2019t even know existed in the body suddenly grew. Chest hair, arm hair, facial hair, not too much but enough to be noticed by those at school who would otherwise turn away. And his eyesight had suddenly been fixed, maybe even improved, given that Steve could see things crystal clear in a way he never had before, even <i>with</i> the glasses. </p>\n<p>The older he gets, the more he relies on the mental improvements given to him. The fast reflexes, the quick thinking, the way he often figures out a problem before it\u2019s even been presented to him\u2026 it all helps as he gets older. Even when the bruises take a little longer to fade and his back aches from time to time.</p>\n<p>The one thing that has always stayed is the spidey sense. When he hadn\u2019t had a name for it, he\u2019d call it an itch, something like goosebumps on the back of his neck, down his arms. Heightening <i>everything</i>, all of his senses categorizing the scene surrounding him. It\u2019s gotten him out of more situations than one, acting quite literally as a sixth sense, or rather, an omni-sense, like all five of them combined into this hybrid force that Steve attributes most of his victories to.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his spidey sense that wakes him up.</p>\n<p>Usually, Steve can turn it off. Sort of. Turn it down, at least, as if he has some sort of internal volume control, that way he doesn\u2019t have to hear the heartbeats of every person in the room, every spoken whisper, every fiber in his shirt. </p>\n<p>He knows a guy in Hell\u2019s Kitchen who has a similar sense, except he <i>can\u2019t</i> turn it down. Steve is thankful that\u2019s not him.</p>\n<p>He probably, stupidly, accidentally-on-purpose heightened his sense while falling asleep with Eddie last night. Who can blame him, honestly? </p>\n<p>He likes the telltale pitter-patter of Eddie\u2019s heart; how it skips a beat when Steve touches him. And maybe he went too far last night, blurring the line they never cross when sleeping in the same bed, but dammit, there\u2019s something so lovely about Eddie. So welcoming. Steve thinks that if this all ends \u2014 whatever this is \u2014 he wants to look back with zero regrets. Which means cuddling up to Eddie and maybe kissing him. Oops. </p>\n<p>He barely remembers falling asleep; how it all happened. He just remembers the catch in Eddie\u2019s breath, the release of all his muscles, the sharpness of his hipbone under Steve\u2019s palm. Feeling, feeling, feeling. Heightening his spidey sense to feel more than humanly possible, because Eddie makes him greedy. Selfish. Makes him want for things he shouldn\u2019t want for.</p>\n<p>He wakes up to that same thump thump thump of Eddie\u2019s heart. Only it\u2019s slower now. They haven\u2019t moved a single inch during the night, and Steve wonders what he would have to do to sleep like this every night \u2014 to be still and rest in the arms of the boy he loves.</p>\n<p>Eddie is really pretty. It\u2019s something Steve knows, but the fact sometimes hits him out of nowhere, blindsides him, and sends him reeling, struggling to catch his breath. Like a child who\u2019s lost his balloon in the grocery store parking lot \u2014 the inevitable shock, the acceptance, the scrambling for the string before it\u2019s lost forever, the scrambling of a memory, of the way Eddie looks when at complete peace.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lying on his back, wearing his threadbare Black Sabbath t-shirt that has seen the inside of a washing machine one too many times. There\u2019s still a patch of skin Steve can feel beneath his palm, chilly compared to the warm hem of his cotton pants.</p>\n<p>Steve wants to kiss him awake. Wants to sneak into the kitchen and make french toast or something; surprise Eddie in bed. And then kiss him again, all syrupy sweet, until his phone buzzes and he has to go save the day. Once again.</p>\n<p>But Eddie doesn\u2019t want Steve. Eddie wants Spider-Man. Spider-Man is Steve, but Eddie doesn\u2019t know that, which means Eddie doesn\u2019t want Steve. Not really.</p>\n<p>When did wanting something so simple become so complicated?</p>\n<p>Steve rolls off of Eddie, pulls the quilts up beneath his chin so he won\u2019t wake, and slips out of the door, back into the safety his own room.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Otto Octavius is really good at what he does.</p>\n<p>Science and technology, the pairing of the two, the pairing of the two with biology, to further medicine and healthcare and all it stands for\u2026</p>\n<p>He reveals <i>why</i> there are fucking voices in his head to Spider-Man two weeks into working with him, because, well, he\u2019s embrassed that his own invention has ruined him this much. He\u2019s embarrassed by how much freedom he\u2019s given to it.</p>\n<p>The patch that connects to his cerebellum not only connects but takes\u2026 takes a piece of his consciousness. Takes a little bit from the left brain and a little less from the right. The idea, of course, is that the limbs would move with a single thought. To merely think of lifting one\u2019s arm lifts their arm. The way prosthetics should be. The way Otto has been trying to perfect for years now.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no real stopping point. Somehow, the arms, take and take and take, until Otto\u2019s consciousness somehow becomes four more consciousnesses, and they\u2019re all whispering in his ear to <i>fight</i> and <i>seize</i> and <i>kill</i>.</p>\n<p>And, well, Otto doesn\u2019t want to kill anybody.</p>\n<p>Which is why he\u2019s asked for Spider-Man\u2019s help. Why he\u2019s asked to be placed in front of the one good person in this damned city (call him a pessimist, whatever) hoping that the young man will inspire him to keep ignoring the thoughts that are getting louder and louder as the days pass.</p>\n<p>They feel like serpents: the arms. Like beasts he can\u2019t control. Like the devil on his shoulder. Today they want him to fight Spider-Man. He pushes the thought back, chastises himself.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing: he\u2019s pretty sure he knows who Spider-Man is. After finding the suits and gear in Steve\u2019s lab, with Steve confirming how close he is to the superhero, Otto thinks it\u2019s probably the young man he brought to his demonstrations. Eddie.</p>\n<p>His first thought, of course, had been that <i>Steve</i> is Spider-Man but\u2026 well, Steve just doesn\u2019t seem like the type. Doesn\u2019t seem like he could put up a fight at all, let alone one against the foes Spider-Man has bested. No, Eddie seemed tougher \u2014 somehow. Like he could get aggressive, if need be.</p>\n<p>And there is, of course, the insecurity in the back of Otto\u2019s head \u2014 the one that solidifies the theory for him. He hopes, with all the days he and Steve have spent together in the lab, that Steve wouldn\u2019t lie to him. He hopes that the boy likes him enough to tell the truth. </p>\n<p>He watches Spider-Man tinker with a web shooter. One that will shock enemies, he had said. His voice sounds garbled and strange; like it\u2019s being passed through a bullhorn, and then maybe some voice modifying equipment. It\u2019s too staticy and deep.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old were you when you got the powers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 let\u2019s see,\u201d Spidey begins to count on his gloved fingers, \u201cJunior year, so sixteen? Seventeen? The years kind of blend together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve fought crime the entire time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no\u2026\u201d The superhero admits. \u201cI was a bit arrogant when I first got them. Did a lot of stupid things, hurt a lot of people. It took a fall from grace to realize that I\u2019ve been given this opportunity, this responsibility, to help people. So I\u2019ve been trying to make up for the asshole I used to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d Spidey laughs, strained.</p>\n<p>Otto feels a pang in his heart for the kid. He can\u2019t be older than twenty-five or so, and he seems to carry a lot of guilt, a lot of shame. Otto can remember himself at that age, full of life and ready to take on the world. The man in front of him just seems tired. Worn down. Distantly, the arms are telling him now is the perfect time to strike. Otto shuts the thoughts down. \u201cI can help you, you know. With the web shooter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cThat would actually be a huge help. Thanks, Otto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s parents always manage to know when he\u2019s having a hard time. Because that\u2019s when they need his support (read: money) the most. </p>\n<p>The older he gets, the more Steve realizes that they don\u2019t contact him hardly at all unless they need something from him. Holidays and birthdays, sure, he\u2019ll get a nice message, but anything else? Steve has a phone full of unanswered texts to prove that he seems to slip their minds most of the time.</p>\n<p>And he wants to blame their jobs, their duties, things they would have to tear themselves away from to speak to him, but the truth is, they just don\u2019t make the effort.</p>\n<p>Hell, Steve is Spider-Man, and he still finds time to text them every week or so. </p>\n<p>Whatever. It doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just that Steve\u2019s place of work burned down nearly a month ago, and they still haven\u2019t so much as tossed him a line to see if he\u2019s still alive. Some days he finds himself thinking pretty dark thoughts \u2014 like, would they even come to his funeral if he did die? And if they did, would it just be to collect the will?</p>\n<p>Steve has one of those. Being Spider-Man and everything. He\u2019s not stupid enough to think he\u2019ll avoid death forever, and he\u2019s certainly not stupid enough to leave his assets to the state. He thinks his parents might raise him from the dead just to kill him again one they find out that his only beneficiaries right now are Robin and Lucas, because those are the only two people Steve trusts to carry his secret with them.</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019ll add Eddie. One day, if he ever gets the courage to confess.</p>\n<p>His mom calls him in the afternoon, reaching out for another loan, and Steve just gives up.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what all he said, but there was a lot of arguing back and forth, a lot of guilt tripping he called out, and a lot of tears from his end only, because dammit if he just wants his mom to call him <i>for him</i> one of these days. And she swears she does, swears the money is an afterthought, but they both know it\u2019s a lie.</p>\n<p>Steve cuts them off. For good this time.</p>\n<p>The pain bubbles in his chest. At the base of his neck, like bile waiting to come up. Only it sits there, festering like a wound.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s not sure when he\u2019ll be okay again.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s Irish, but he knows Uncle Wayne likes to say he is. Likes to use Saint Patrick\u2019s Day as an Official Munson Holiday, which is just an excuse to drink themselves to death without any guilt.</p>\n<p>Wayne invites himself over this time, trudging cans of Guinness along with him, and he plops himself onto Eddie and Steve\u2019s couch, channel surfs until he finds a NASCAR race, and pops the tab on one of the cans.</p>\n<p>Steve has been down in the dumps lately. And Eddie knows why \u2014 they had discussed Steve\u2019s parents in great length a few nights ago, sitting on opposite ends of the couch with their legs intertwined. Steve had gotten drunk and Eddie had let him say whatever he wanted about his parents. Had let Steve cry about the fact that he felt he had been too mean.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s okay now. Better, at least. But Eddie knows how it feels to be cast off, to be left floating in a vast ocean of life, of fucking adulthood, with no one to find shelter in when everything gets too much. Because that\u2019s what parents are supposed to do.</p>\n<p>Eddie spent two years in foster care before social services found Wayne. Those years were hard to forget, days and weeks of being tossed around and traded like an object. Like an unwanted object, at that.</p>\n<p>Sure, maybe it\u2019s different when you\u2019re a kid versus when you\u2019re an adult, but you never really stop being a kid, do you? That eleven year old in foster care is still inside of Eddie. He still knocks on his heart once in a while, still begs to be loved. Eddie can\u2019t imagine Steve is any different.</p>\n<p>So he drags Steve onto the couch with him and his probably-not-Irish uncle. </p>\n<p>And they drink and drink and drink.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this,\u201d Spidey drops onto the camping chat with a dramatic flourish. There\u2019s a wind passing through the city that only March can bring, and it seems to ache the superhero\u2019s joints, if the extra moaning and groaning is anything for Eddie to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you, forty?\u201d Eddie exhales a laugh. Pungent smoke pours out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-five,\u201d Spidey says.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a house party across the street. Loud EDM music echoes from the apartment window directly across from theirs. Eddie has been awkwardly avoiding the strange looks given through the window every time a confused and drunk college kid passes by the window. </p>\n<p><i>Steve is twenty-five</i>, he thinks unhelpfully.</p>\n<p>Eddie hasn\u2019t stopped thinking about his theory \u2014 that Steve might very well be the man sitting beside him right now. There are just a lot of coincidences, some he can explain away (like the allergies) and some he can\u2019t (like the moles, and the bruises.)</p>\n<p>But if it is Steve, then he is determined to keep it a secret from Eddie. With all the progress Eddie has made in their friendship, he doesn\u2019t want to ruin it all by asking a stupid question.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Hey Steve, are you actually Spider-Man?</i>\n</p>\n<p>It sounds stupid even in his head. Eddie scoffs, takes another pull from his cigarette.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose really are bad for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie says with a roll of his eyes. \u201cSteve tells me all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>There. He said his name. Eddie glances briefly over at the superhero, hoping to see some kind of reaction. Tense shoulders, the whir of his eye lenses\u2026 anything, but the man just sits there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. Eddie supposed he has to be good at playing cool, if he\u2019s been in this game nearly eight years. He\u2019s got to be good at keeping secrets. </p>\n<p>Maybe he should try another way to get the hero to break a sweat. Say something that would have Steve stutter, not Spider-Man. \u201cSteve\u2019s always right,\u201d Eddie says, waving his stick around casually. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys, you know? He\u2019s just good at everything, and he\u2019s always right, and he\u2019s so fucking smart, like, you should hear this dude\u2019s ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>A twitch of Spider-Man\u2019s fingers. Just a short drum against his thigh. \u201cOh. Um. Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Eddie were less sober he could probably imagine Steve asking. Those big brown eyes that are always so unsure. \u201cReally!\u201d He says, fully turning to face Spider-Man. Leaning in so close the masked man has to press a finger to the center of his chest and move him back. Eddie flops back into his chair, laughs, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know, <i>Spidey</i>. And he has this work ethic, you know? Never seen someone work so hard. He\u2019s so good,\u201d Eddie stubs out his cigarette butt on the arm of his camp chair; leaves a black hole behind. \u201c<i>So fucking good</i>. I don\u2019t think he knows how good he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man is silent. He reaches up to his head, rubs his palm across his mask, like he\u2019s raking his fingers through whatever hair is hidden under there. There\u2019s a chestnut curl peeking out from the nape of the mask. </p>\n<p>Eddie wants to reach out and touch, wants to reach out and pull the mask up. But he\u2019s afraid of what he might see \u2014 rather, who he might see.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be that great,\u201d Spider-Man says with a weak laugh. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best person I know,\u201d Eddie can say it honestly. Doesn\u2019t really have to think about it. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie cranes his neck, faces the sky. He shrugs. If it\u2019s not Steve under the mask, his next words are gonna sting. But if it is, then he needs to say it all the more: \u201cYou\u2019re good. But Steve is Steve. There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d He rolls his head to the side, grins, <i>practically croons</i>, \u201cSorry, Spidey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man\u2019s head is ducked. Eddie thinks if he took his mask off right now, he might be blushing the prettiest shade of pink. \u201c\u2018S okay,\u201d he says. The voice modifier sounds too mechanical for his hunched posture. \u201cYou know, Eddie, I think maybe I should tell y\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHoly shit! Spider-Man! Is that you?\u201d</i> Someone screams from the fire escape. The girl holds up a bottle of vodka in one hand, a phone in the other, <i>\u201cCan I take a selfie with you?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Eddie sighs. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man stands. Stretches. \u201cSee you, Eddie,\u201d and he swings across the alley, lands on the opposite escape. </p>\n<p>Eddie watches him disappear into the crowd; wonders idly if Spider-Man was about to come clean.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Steve starts talking as soon as Robin opens her door. \u201cI almost told Eddie,\u201d he drops the bag of takeout he brought on her counter; starts rifling through her silverware drawer just to have something to do with his hands, \u201cI almost told Eddie, Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d Robin murmurs. She approaches him, tugging on his shirt until he follows her to the couch. \u201cTake a deep breath, please. Start from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Robin is his best friend. In some twisted way, he\u2019s thankful she was the one who got injected with spider venom that night. He can\u2019t imagine mentoring anyone else; loving anyone more. Not in the way the two spiderlings love each other. She\u2019s always there for him, even when his problems seem stupid, lame, unimportant. She listens anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie was telling me \u2014 as Spider-Man \u2014 how much he liked me \u2014 as Steve \u2014 and I felt so\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I just thought that would be the time to tell him. But I got interrupted, so I just left, and now I don\u2019t know how to face Eddie as Spider-Man <i>or</i> Steve because I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to be so upset when he finds out I lied to him. Like I tricked him into liking me. God, Rob, I feel like a creep. I never should\u2019ve let him kiss me. I never should\u2019ve kissed him back. He\u2019s going to be so upset when he finds out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin hums to let him know she\u2019s listening. She leans in close so that their arms are touching. \u201cDo you remember my best friend from high school that I told you about? Vickie?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve thinks of their late night post-Thanksgiving Facebook stalking. The redhead with a pixie cut, a husband, and two kids\u2013 \u201cYeah. I remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we were really close, and in junior year, I developed a crush on her. It felt wrong. It felt so wrong to like her, you know? She trusted me to be her friend, and here I was, feeling like a perv for changing in the same room as her, or going to her house for a sleepover. And it wasn\u2019t\u2013 I mean, I was just a kid in love, you know? I wasn\u2019t <i>leering</i> at her or anything. I just had a crush. But it felt pretty wicked at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Steve leans over, props his chin in his hand. He can smell the orange chicken in the kitchen. He wants to eat his feelings instead of talking about them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s internalized homophobia,\u201d Robin says plainly. \u201cYou\u2019re talking like you\u2019re\u2013 like you\u2019re this horrible person for kissing the boy you like and it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not that! Eddie knows he\u2019s kissing someone under the mask, you know? He knows there\u2019s a possibility that it\u2019s you\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah right,\u201d Steve scoffs. He\u2019s not discounting what she\u2019s saying, but he can\u2019t imagine Eddie wouldn\u2019t feel a little betrayed to know that he kissed <i>Steve</i> and Steve didn\u2019t come clean right away. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou just told me he was talking to Spider-Man about how much he likes you. Like, he verbally told you that he likes you more than your alias. How is that not validating?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s brave enough to admit that he doesn\u2019t actually believe anything Eddie says about him. Eddie talks about Steve like he\u2019s <i>someone</i>. Likes he\u2019s a person worthy of praise. And Eddie does praise him, out loud, to fucking Spider-Man of all people, makes Steve out to be this incredible man and, well\u2013</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t know what to do with all the love Eddie keeps bringing his way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been ambushing him for awhile now; a tumbling avalanche of broken bath bombs and arnica gel and passed joints and candied green grapes. Steve holds every memory on his shoulders, blankets them over his burdens, hopes Eddie knows how much he means to him because it\u2019s not like Steve could ever tell him. It\u2019s not like Steve could ever just <i>say it</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be selfish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin rubs his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not selfish to want to be loved, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Oscorp donates a lab to Otto\u2019s research.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the least the mayor could do, considering he and Otto have known each other since they were in elementary school. Hell, Otto is pretty sure Norman was present at his bar mitzvah, even if that was a billion years ago.</p>\n<p>So Otto moves all of his stuff into the cold building. Although they hiss, the arms are actually pretty helpful when it comes to carrying heavy objects. They\u2019re obnoxious, though, the way they snap and whir at anyone he passes. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got four personal guard dogs and they all <i>suck</i>. </p>\n<p>He invites all of his employees \u2014 at least, the ones who haven\u2019t taken a job elsewhere \u2014 to return to their jobs. They work on the arms as a team now, spending most of their days trying to figure out how to detach the extremities from their boss.</p>\n<p>Steve Harrington is helping him today. He\u2019s got scrubs underneath his lab coat. His thick goggles cover wire glasses as he fiddles with one of the claws; straps it into a harness just so he can try and study the damned thing. </p>\n<p>Otto hasn\u2019t talked to him much since giving him the box of Spider-Man things. And with each passing work day it seems like they never get the lab to themselves, where there\u2019s enough privacy to bring it up. Until today. When the limbs are extra feisty, when the voices in his head are extra loud. Telling him to pull out of the restraints and <i>attack, attack, attack!</i></p>\n<p>\u201cWho was that man you brought to the presentation?\u201d Otto chooses to ask. He watches Steve carefully for any reaction that might show him the truth.</p>\n<p>Steve only looks confused. \u201cEddie? He\u2019s my roommate. I told you he was coming, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Otto does remember, of course. He just wants more information. \u201cDoes he know about Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s eyes sort of resemble a baby deer\u2019s. Surprised. Big. <i>So Eddie does know something.</i> \u201cHe knows as much as the rest of New York City,\u201d is all he says. </p>\n<p>Otto hums. \u201cYou know, Spidey and I have been working together lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Steve doesn\u2019t look surprised. Eddie\u2019s probably already told him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat friend, that Spider-Man,\u201d Otto says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve smiles. It\u2019s forced. \u201cGreat friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cTo getting your fucking job back!\u201d Eddie stands, lifts his wine glass in the air. His voice echoes across the steakhouse.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo Steve!\u201d Dustin follows Eddie\u2019s lead, his voice high and lispy. He lifts his glass of coke.</p>\n<p>Steve reaches out with an exasperated sigh, grasps the hem of Dustin\u2019s shirt and yanks him back down onto his seat. There\u2019s a blush on his face, though, which Eddie counts as a win.</p>\n<p>He has successfully managed to round up all of Steve\u2019s friends for one night of celebrating. The truth is, Steve\u2019s been working hard. After the lab burned down, he\u2019s been taking up more responsibilities with Jameson, even though he clearly hates the guy, taking constant pictures of Spider-Man for each daily spread. He\u2019s been putting in extra work with Dr. Octavius, too, as far as Eddie knows, to secure a job back at the lab whenever it reopens. And now that it has, Steve\u2019s work has paid off. Because Otto Octavius gave him a promotion.</p>\n<p>The round table is full of everyone Steve so fondly talks about. Steve is at Eddie\u2019s right side; their elbows bump from time to time whenever one of them reaches for a napkin or fork. On Steve\u2019s left side is Dustin, then in order: Lucas, Max, Nancy, and Robin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta say,\u201d Nancy takes a sip of her red wine, \u201cJameson has been loving having you back on the team as often as you have been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie watches Steve\u2019s reaction from the side. He\u2019s wearing a soft yellow sweater. A silver necklace falls over the top of it \u2014 a little spider pendant, because of-fucking-course Steve is the type of guy to hide in plain sight. His gingerbread curls are freshly conditioned, thanks to a product that had their entire apartment smelling like raspberries. The faint scent is there even now, which makes Eddie thankful for Steve\u2019s Lush addiction. </p>\n<p>Steve is dipping his fries in Eddie\u2019s steak sauce, leaning into his space like it\u2019s his. And it is, it\u2019s always been, but there\u2019s something really loud about their shared space tonight. The steak and the red wine and the raspberry conditioner and Steve\u2019s sleeve against Eddie\u2019s bare arm. \u201cHe'll get over it. How\u2019s your spread? I\u2019m really excited to read it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nancy beams. She starts telling Steve \u2014 and the entire table \u2014 about the article she\u2019s been working on for approval. \u201cIt\u2019s about Ghost-Spider, and what having a female-presenting superhero does for our society.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin, who has been diligently munching on chicken fingers during this entire meal, freezes up beside Eddie. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a piece in Ghost-Spider?\u201c</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s another thing Eddie has been trying to work out: the identities of the other spiders. Spider-Man told him he knows Ghost personally, so Eddie assumes Steve knows her personally, which has him staring a little too hard at Robin sometimes. Like maybe he\u2019ll find a clue amongst her freckle-y face.</p>\n<p>Steve places his palm on Eddie\u2019s knee, leans in till his lips are practically touching his ear, \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. Don\u2019t let Dustin eat my dessert when it comes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie nods. He waits, holding his breath, for Steve to get out of his seat. He runs his hand over Eddie\u2019s shoulders as he passes, <i>like a boyfriend might do.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cWait. So are you and Steve dating?\u201d Dustin asks as soon as the man in question is out of earshot. </p>\n<p>Eddie finishes his glass of wine. <i>God, this is gonna be a long night</i>. </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta head to the lab early tomorrow,\u201d Steve mumbles around a toothpick. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re walking home together, after Eddie successfully convinced Dustin not to ask any awkward questions once Steve returned. Just like in the restaurant, their elbows keep bumping. Only now they\u2019ve both got their jackets on, and Steve\u2019s bundled in his bright scarf. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo no sleeping in?\u201d Eddie deducts. Ever since the first cuddle, the two have become rather reluctant to get up in the morning, choosing to stay in each other\u2019s arms for an extra half hour most mornings. The fact that Steve is warning him that he can\u2019t cuddle tomorrow is not only cute, it\u2019s fucking torturous, because it means that Steve has been liking their time together just as much as Eddie has.</p>\n<p>God, Eddie loves him so much. He thinks the entire city couldn\u2019t hold the amount of love he has for Steve. </p>\n<p>Steve kicks a discarded cigarette as they walk back towards their apartment. \u201cOtto keeps asking about you. Isn\u2019t that weird? I mean, he didn\u2019t even meet you when you came to the presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he want to?\u201d Eddie furrows his brows, confused, \u201cMeet me, I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Steve shrugs. \u201cMaybe he thinks we\u2019re friends now and wants to meet the people in my life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can say no,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to mix personal life with business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBit too late for that,\u201d Steve scoffs.</p>\n<p>Eddie thinks about the spider on Steve\u2019s chest. The one he wears proudly. The one that he hides. How he\u2019s been mixing business and pleasure for most of his life. \u201cI promise if I ever meet him, I\u2019ll make the interaction so boring that he\u2019ll never ask about me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if you could ever make anything boring,\u201d Steve says, almost fondly. He glances at Eddie, eyes reflecting the streetlights. He\u2019s a fucking sweetheart, the way he compliments, the way he loves. Eddie doesn\u2019t know how he got so lucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Stevie.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The thoughts have been getting darker.</p>\n<p>Otto wants to chalk it up to his lack of sleep (it\u2019s surprisingly hard to get comfy with four mechanical arms attached to his back \u2014 who knew?) But the truth is, he\u2019s been letting his guard down. Nights alone with just him and the arms give him a lot of time to think, a lot of time to plot.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not like his plan is to hurt anyone\u2026 it doesn\u2019t start out like that anyway. Maybe he\u2019s been listening to that godawful Jameson podcast too much (truthfully, he never realizes he\u2019s listening to it until about halfway through, when he scrambles to shut it off.) The arms thrive off of hatred towards Spider-Man. Otto doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s Spider-Man specifically. Maybe because he\u2019s the one Otto is trying to get to <i>save him</i>, and the arms don\u2019t want him to be saved. They don\u2019t want to be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Every day, Otto\u2019s head feels a little more foggy, a little more disorientated. He\u2019d never tell anyone, but some days he wakes up in the city, having no idea how he got there. Some days, he finds himself on the way to the lab, with the intent to <i>destroy</i>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a terrible, helpless feeling inside of him, but he wants it the way a dying man wants sleep. He knows there\u2019s some sort of relief on the other side. Like maybe if he did kill Spider-Man, the arms would leave him alone.</p>\n<p>Yes, that\u2019s all he wants: to be left alone.</p>\n<p>So when Steve comes to the lab with Eddie \u2014 <i>that\u2019s him that\u2019s him that\u2019s him</i>,<br>\nthe arms are telling him \u2014 unannounced, Otto can barely stop himself from lurching forward, letting the arms carry him towards the two men.</p>\n<p>Steve stands firm, Eddie steps back. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not used to the arms,\u201d Steve says, dropping his palm across Eddie\u2019s back. \u201cDr. Octavius, this is Eddie Munson. Eddie, this is Otto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d Eddie beams. His posture is so different from Spider-Man\u2019s that Otto finds himself internally fighting back with the arms. <i>Are we sure this is him?</i></p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Otto shakes Eddie\u2019s hand. Pretends this is the first time they\u2019re meeting. Because it\u2019s not, is it? Otto has been around Spider-Man a lot lately. He knows the superhero as if he were his own son.</p>\n<p>So why is Eddie looking at him like he has no idea who he is?</p>\n<p>Steve takes Eddie into his lab and starts to show him everything he\u2019s working on, but Otto stays there, his thoughts drowning out the whir of the robotic arms attached to him.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Has he got it all wrong? </i>\n</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie glances around the sterile room. \u201cThis is all yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAuthorized by Doc,\u201d Steve answers. \u201cBut I have the keys, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>It occurs to Eddie that this must be a huge act of trust from Steve. To show Eddie where a lot of the magic happens. The fact that Eddie could open any of these drawers and maybe find blueprints for a new suit, or a web shooter, or all the other things Spidey tells him about but Steve keeps close to his chest.</p>\n<p>He sits on a stool, watches Steve wash his hands in one of the sinks and get to work. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Eds, this is going to be the most boring hour of your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlready regretting it,\u201d Eddie says, passing Steve a teasing glance so he knows he\u2019s just kidding. \u201cGot a coloring sheet or something for me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Steve tossed his bag on the counter and pulls out his camera. \u201cI just have to figure out what\u2019s wrong with this thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey not as high def as usual?\u201d Eddie picks at a scratch on the lab table. </p>\n<p>\u201cSurpringly enough, no, he\u2019s not,\u201d Steve begins to take apart the camera, and Eddie watches.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nice to watch people work. Those silent moments when one is completely focused on the task in front of them. Steve\u2019s fingers are long and thin. His hands are huge, big enough to cover his camera, but the way he handles it says otherwise. He\u2019s not some bumbling oaf, he\u2019s delicate \u2014 he\u2019s good with his hands. And on some days the fact would have Eddie\u2019s stomach twisting, hot and bothered by the idea of what those hands could do; what those fingers could do. But today, he\u2019s content to just note the callouses on Steve\u2019s fingers, the knobs of his knuckles, the freckles that dot the webbing in between.</p>\n<p>Steve is still wearing those fake glasses. Eddie has gathered by now that he must\u2019ve worn them before he got his powers; they must help keep him grounded. He works with a childlike frown, wrinkled brow and the tip of his tongue poking out every time he gets caught on an issue. </p>\n<p>God, Eddie wants to grab him. Wants to shove all the lab equipment off the counter space the way they do in those steamy romance films he watches with Chrissy. Wants to pick Steve up and place him on the newly cleared surface, wants to grab his face and kiss him until they both forget where they are. The kind of kissing where neither of them realize they have run out of breath, until they do, parting with soft inhales between them, chests rising and falling, pulling closer and closer, reaching into Steve\u2019s space, wetting his lips and\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie? Did you hear him?\u201d Steve is staring at him with a knowing smirk. So knowing that Eddie almost thinks Steve can read his mind, like maybe Spider-Man never indulged those powers to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie manages to choke out. He looks over to Otto standing in the doorway. The old man\u2019s arms snap at him menacingly. \u201cSorry, what did you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Otto smiles, \u201cI said I could give you a tour of the lab while Steve works on his camera.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie doesn\u2019t really want a tour. He\u2019s a little too content to sit and watch Steve fiddle with his camera all day. But, well, he\u2019s not really good at saying no. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat! Follow me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Otto lifts himself onto the two lower robotic arms. The claws lock onto the floor, a loud <i>click, click, click</i> as they go. The upper arms turn to face Eddie, the bolt in their mechanical palms like all-seeing eyes, leering at him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unsettling, is what it is. Eddie wishes he could turn around and go back to Steve, but gosh darn it, Wayne has raised him to be polite to a fault.</p>\n<p>And a fault it is, because Otto isn\u2019t giving him a tour at all, but he\u2019s leading him onto the dark stairwell. The limbs echo even worse in the confined space. </p>\n<p>Eddie gets a sinking feeling in his gut, like something bad is about to happen. He doesn\u2019t know what, can\u2019t pinpoint it, but it\u2019s gnawing at him, crawling up his spine the longer Otto stays silent.</p>\n<p>He reaches his hand in his pocket, clicks the button on the doohickey \u2014 hopes Steve is listening, just in case.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy arms have been telling me many things about you, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eddie swallows. </p>\n<p>The arms snap and twist. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Otto\u2019s voice sounds a little strange suddenly, like it\u2019s not his but someone else\u2019s, maybe not just someone, but a lot of someones. It sounds overlayed, five different voices fighting for dominance, distorted and maniacal. \u201cSee, they told me you were Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie clicks the button again. \u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Otto opens a door and light pours in. They\u2019re on some empty floor of the lab consisting of only a small pedestal. And on the wall, rows of long, snake-like appendages lying limp on hooks, some shiny and silver, some charred a jet black. The walls themselves are broken tile, ashy residue, and all the other signs of experiments gone wrong. \u201cBut then I met you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie steps into the room. That burnt tin foil smell lingers. He wonders what\u2019s taking Spider-Man so long. Steve\u2019s just downstairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 <i>met me</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like I thought you\u2019d be,\u201d Otto lifts himself into the air, turns to spread his human arms as he speaks. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Spider-Man, see. After the fire, I discovered something fascinating. Steve works very closely with Spider-Man. Through deduction, I thought perhaps he was you. And I\u2019ve been confident in that theory until, like I said, I met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd..?\u201d Eddie wrings his fingers together. \u201cNow what do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think\u2013\u201d the arm snaps at Eddie, making him stumble back, and back, until his back hit the wall. \u201cI think my first theory rang true. See, before I thought you were Spider-Man, naturally, I figured it was <i>Steve</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>Shit.</i> Eddie closes his eyes just as the arms clamp him to the wall. The pain is blunt, and blinding. He suddenly can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s reminded of middle school nights at the local roller rink, slipping and falling on his tailbone. That awful feeling like he'll never breathe again, like every nerve in his body has seized up. God, he wants Steve. He needs Steve, because he has no fucking clue what is happening right now. Like, at all. </p>\n<p>But if Otto has figured it out, then maybe it\u2019s over. Maybe this is where it all goes wrong \u2014 where Eddie meets his unfortunate end. This will be what Steve consistently warned him about from behind that mask, that being close with Spider-Man gets people hurt.</p>\n<p>And yet somehow, <i>somehow</i>, Eddie doesn\u2019t regret it. Even if his ribs feel like they\u2019re being crushed by a hydraulic press right now.</p>\n<p>He keeps his eyes closed, mostly out of pain, which he\u2019s never really taken well. It briefly registers somewhere in the back of his head that Otto is still talking, and Eddie is struggling to breathe. It\u2019s like there\u2019s cotton in his ears suddenly, as the hand pushes him further and further against the wall. </p>\n<p>The pressure mounts and mounts, and then it is released.</p>\n<p>Eddie crumples to the floor.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a rare morning when both Steve and Eddie are both home.</p>\n<p>Steve pours boiling water into his favorite mug \u2014 an orange one with Linus Van Pelt and his blanket painted on the side. Dustin made it for him awhile back, some random art class he took encouraged him to try out pottery. His lack of talent is the reason Linus looks a little janky, but Steve adores the cup anyway. He drops a bag of dandelion tea into the steaming water.</p>\n<p>While he waits for it to steep, he takes two slices of bread out of the toaster and twists open an avocado. He spreads it across the toast, sprinkles some everything bagel seasoning on it, cuts the toast into diagonals because that\u2019s how Eddie likes to eat it. </p>\n<p>He brings the tea and toast into Eddie\u2019s room, where the boy is fast asleep, a bandage wrapped around his torso. The bluish bruise lays splotchy, until it bleeds into purple and red, splattered over his pale skin. Fast asleep, he\u2019s not in pain, and Steve is almost reluctant to wake him up.</p>\n<p>But Eddie doesn\u2019t heal the way Steve does, so he needs to be fed with as much nutrients as possible. </p>\n<p>It hasn\u2019t been twenty-four hours since Steve wrapped Otto in his robotic own arms and helped send him off to Rikers, ignoring his pleas for help, for a second chance. Any other day Steve might\u2019ve listened, might\u2019ve been slow in the fight, might\u2019ve tried to talk him down. Might\u2019ve waited before calling the police. Any other victim, and Steve might not have let blind rage fuel him. </p>\n<p>But it was Eddie. Eddie, with his thumb pressed against the doohickey button so hard there\u2019s still a visible indent, like it was his last attempt, and yet Steve was late. He had been so focused on his camera, he had let Otto take Eddie away. He knew Otto had been a risk, and he still trusted him. </p>\n<p>With <i>his</i> Eddie.</p>\n<p>His sweet boy, who's been up all night because it had hurt to raise his chest to breathe. He only fell asleep last night out of sheer exhaustion, and Steve had stayed by his side the entire time, wishing he could inject some of his venom into Eddie if it just made him feel better. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s tried to let him sleep as long as he can, but the doctor \u2014 yes, Steve broke his <i>no doctors</i> rule for Eddie \u2014 said to make sure he has a meal with each dose of pain medication, and two o\u2019clock is already an hour over schedule.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, sweetheart, can you wake up for me? I\u2019ve got your favorite toast. And some tea. You\u2019ve got to take your meds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie blinks himself awake. There\u2019s a grumpy furrow on his face, like a kitten whose nap has been cut short. \u201cToo nauseous to eat,\u201d he mumbles sleepily, and God, Steve knows the feeling, but he knows that not eating just makes it worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but just a few bites with your pill, okay? Then you can go back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie nods, winces at the movement, and then takes the pill without complaint. He finishes half of his toast and all of his tea before Steve gives him the go ahead to shuffle back under his pile of quilts. \u201cCan you stay with me? Just until I fall back asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve still feels a lot of guilt shift in his gut. Eddie has just been hurt, badly, because of <i>him</i>, and he doesn\u2019t even know it. He\u2019s probably pissed at Spider-Man for putting him in harm\u2019s way. He probably wants nothing to do with the guy. Steve can only imagine how upset he\u2019ll be when he finds out that it was Steve who failed to protect him.</p>\n<p>That trust is gonna be broken, and Steve is going to lose the best friend he\u2019s ever had.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, I don\u2019t think\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Eddie\u2019s breath shutters. \u201cI just want you near me. \u2018Makes me feel safe.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>It shouldn\u2019t,</i> Steve wants to say. <i>I got you into this mess. You should hate me. Once you find out, you\u2019re going to hate me.</i></p>\n<p>But Eddie\u2019s black-hole eyes are drawing him in, so he lets himself be pulled. Over and over and over again.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>One thing about bruises: they fade. </p>\n<p>One thing about feelings: they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Eddie thinks he\u2019ll never stop loving Steve. It\u2019s all he can think about, high on pain medication, as Steve applies arnica gel to his bruises. The gel is cold on his yellowing skin. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a week, and the pain is hardly there anymore. Now he\u2019s just a little more sore than usual. And spacey. God, this morphine is making him loopy. \u201cYou know what this gel is for, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looks at him expectantly \u2014 <i> Pretty Steve</i>, Eddie thinks, with his vampire bite freckles and pink lips \u2014 \u201cBruises?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie does his best to wriggle his eyebrows suggestively. \u201c<i>Bruises</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck off,\u201d Steve laughs. </p>\n<p>Eddie laughs too, even though it hurts his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve gone this long in your spider career without arnica gel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve falters. The mattress dips, as he turns to face Eddie more head-on. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Eddie\u2019s head feels stuffy, the way it does when he\u2019s had too much weed. So, he has trouble keeping his mouth shut; filtering his thoughts. He nearly giggles, because doesn\u2019t Steve know that he\u2019s Spider-Man? \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2013 Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans back into his stack of pillows, sitting upright. Lulls his head to the side and reaches out to poke Steve\u2019s clothed chest. \u201cI\u2019ve known for <i>ages</i>.\u201d He drags the last word out, hopes he sounds playful, but Steve looks almost scared. So he sobers up. Tries to, at least, \u201cSteve? Are you mad at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d Steve blurts. His skin is a splotchy red. \u201cYou\u2013 I just\u2013\u201d He runs his fingers through his hair, \u201c<i>You know</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I know,\u201d Eddie closes his eyes, reclines back. His medication is lulling him back to sleep. \u201cI know <i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>With Otto Octavius awaiting trial, Steve is out of a job once again.</p>\n<p>He moves all of his lab equipment home in his room and then hightails it out of there, because he\u2019ll be damned if Eddie gets up and tries to talk to him. </p>\n<p>Steve huddles in the far corner of the library, editing his photos to send to Jameson, who, <i>thank God</i>, is so narcissistic he won\u2019t even question Steve asking to get his job back <i>again</i>. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s hiding from Eddie, like a coward, because he isn\u2019t exactly sure how to process what has happened.</p>\n<p>If he had to recount yesterday to someone, he\u2019d find himself saying that Eddie knows that he\u2019s Spider-Man. And apparently Eddie has known he\u2019s Spider-Man for a long time. He\u2019s never said anything, though. Not when he kissed Steve, or when Steve kissed him back. Hell, Eddie had waxed poetic about Steve <i>to</i> Steve, and he knew the entire time.</p>\n<p>Steve slowly shuts his laptop, realization dawning on him.</p>\n<p>Eddie knew the entire time, and he doesn\u2019t care. In fact, he told Steve to his face (mask) that he liked Steve more than Spider-Man. That <i>there was no comparison.</i></p>\n<p>Oh, shit. Eddie loves him.</p>\n<p>It would be an arrogant thought if Eddie hadn\u2019t been telling him for the past few months, in his own way, and Steve was just too in his head to recognize it for what it is.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s love. Fully, whole-heartedly, requited love.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Eddie stress cleans. It\u2019s almost like his New Year\u2019s drawer organizing, except it\u2019s a million times worse, because Eddie uses the dirty details of the apartment to distract himself from his worst mistakes. </p>\n<p>His current one being: admitting to Steve that he knows about his secret.</p>\n<p>That had never been part of the plan. The plan was to let Steve tell him when he was ready, if he ever <i>is</i> ready. Which Eddie had been fine with. If that\u2019s what Steve wanted, Eddie was willing to give it to him.</p>\n<p>But now, Eddie has taken that freedom away from Steve, and he has no idea how to apologize for that.</p>\n<p>So, he cleans. He sprays his all natural cleaner and he opens all the windows and he wipes down the walls as if they\u2019re caked in dust. With his wireless earbuds in, he doesn\u2019t hear Steve coming in. He doesn\u2019t notice him standing in his doorway until he turns around, Elton John crooning in his ear (Tiny Dancer fucks. Sue him.)</p>\n<p>Steve is as still as a statue. He\u2019s wearing a fuzzy red sweater that sheds on everything every time Eddie washes it, but he never complains because of how soft Steve looks in it. His hair is windswept, his cheeks pinched pink from the spring chill. His chest is rising and falling, as if he\u2019s just ran the entire way home from wherever he\u2019s been all day. </p>\n<p>Eddie takes out his earbuds. The room falls silent. \u201cHi,\u201d he says, unsure. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods, face like stone, \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah..?\u201d Eddie frowns. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve steps into the room, and he takes up the space, smells like spun sugar and dried oak, eyes hard and determined, like he\u2019s either going to punch Eddie or kiss him. \u201cYou <i>love</i> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Eddie risks a smile. \u201cYeah. I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve reaches out, <i>nimble fingers</i>, and bunches up the fabric at Eddie\u2019s chest. The Lord of The Rings iron-on graphic is already cracked from too many washes. Eddie can\u2019t help but think he\u2019d let Steve ruin every shirt he owns if he pulls him close like this every time. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a sudden, quick breath. Hot, soft, nose brushing nose, and Eddie is thinking <i>he\u2019s going to kiss me</i>, and Steve <i>does</i>.</p>\n<p>Softer than he could ever imagine, Steve\u2019s lips are pliant, soft and wet. He gives over control as soon as they make contact, and Eddie takes over gladly, slides his palms up Steve\u2019s neck to cup his jaw. To run his thumbs back and forth over Steve\u2019s jawline, over his freckles, over his stubbly chin. It\u2019s almost like overstimulation, Eddie briefly registers, like a static fuzz filling his head. But it\u2019s good. Too good, because Steve is opening his mouth, letting Eddie in. His hands move down Eddie\u2019s chest, fall at the soft curve of his hips, squeezes and pulls him close, so that they\u2019re tumbling into each other, Steve\u2019s sneakers squeaking as he tries to regain his footing.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a giggle in between them, swallowed by Eddie. And then he\u2019s being pushed back until he hits the exposed brick wall, and it\u2019s all good, until Steve presses all of his body weight into Eddie, and then suddenly he feels a bit like mechanical arms, like a vice grip, and Eddie doesn\u2019t mean to but he starts to hyperventilate. Starts to shake beneath Steve\u2019s touch. Starts to push Steve away</p>\n<p>Steve lets go. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie tries to catch his breath. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he pants, then groans. He slides down the wall until he\u2019s sitting on the floor, and presses his face into his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is so unsexy of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve sits beside Eddie, not quite touching, but close enough to be comforting. \u201cWas it the wall?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pressure, I think.\u201d Eddie risks a glance, worried he\u2019s offended Steve, but he finds that Steve is giving him his full attention. There\u2019s a warmth in his eyes that makes Eddie feel safe enough to continue. \u201cBeing pressed between two things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll keep that in mind next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s heart stutters in his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a next time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s going to be a next time,\u201d Steve grins, wide and boyish. There\u2019s a small scar on his cheek. He leans over, just enough to bump Eddie with his elbow, \u201cIn case me melting into that kiss didn\u2019t make it glaringly obvious: I love you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s where the magic happens,\u201d Steve shoulders his door open and spreads his arms to present his \u2014 in his opinion \u2014 lackluster room.</p>\n<p>Eddie steps inside.</p>\n<p>The twin bed shoved in the corner seems almost an afterthought compared to the rest of his room, which is mostly covered in desks he\u2019s picked up off of the street and monitors he and Dustin have bought over the years. They mostly just show CCTV from random places. There\u2019s one Dustin has programmed to transcript police scanners in real time. There\u2019s also one with Steve\u2019s personal Twitter open because, well, he\u2019s still human.</p>\n<p>A lot of his old suits are hanging up on hooks. Each surface in his room is covered with random parts for all of his gadgets. He\u2019s still trying to perfect those electric web shooters, after all. Some of his old school trophies are on a small wooden shelf above his window. There\u2019s one hanging plant, on its way to dying, and another one, already dead.</p>\n<p>Steve thinks it\u2019s boring.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Eddie expresses. He shakes his hands, wrings his fingers, the way he does when he\u2019s excited about something \u2014 the way Steve knew he\u2019d do as soon as he saw all the nerdy shit in his room. \u201cIs this welding gear?\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve watches Eddie pull his welding mask over his head. He slaps the face guard down and giggles to himself. <i>God, he\u2019s adorable.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cHow have I not heard you tinkering in here?\u201d Eddie asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI usually wait until you\u2019re working.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie hums. He takes off the mask. Smiles shyly at the floor, \u201cHey. I\u2019m glad you trust me enough to bring me in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve isn\u2019t sure he could trust Eddie any <i>more</i>, considering he knows all of his darkest secrets now. But Eddie is looking at him so sweetly, which leaves Steve\u2019s mouth feeling a little dry. A little at a loss for words. \u201cM-Me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The end of April kisses New York gently. Yellow pollen covers the railings, but soft rain washes it away before any allergies can kick in.</p>\n<p>The nights are warm, and so Eddie sits on his fire escape in shorts and a t-shirt. He nurses a beer and waits with an impatient tap of his foot for his boyfriend to meet him. There\u2019s a cold bottle of beer nestled in the cup holder of the camp chair beside him. He watches a bead of condensation sweat down the neck of the bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone sitting here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie snorts. He glanced up at Spider-Man, perched on the corner of the railing. \u201cNah,\u201d he plays along; gestures to the chair, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man plops down on the chair, props his feet up onto the railing, and grabs the bottle. He rolls his mask up to his nose \u2014 uses his teeth to pop the tab. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear the mask with me anymore, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI disagree, sweetheart,\u201d Spider-Man grins. His eye lenses whir playfully. \u201cYou never know who could be watching us through their windows.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t mean to, but he pouts. \u201cI want to see your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero snorts. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see my face every day!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYour point?\u201d </p>\n<p>Spider-Man throws his head back and laughs. He drops the beer bottle back in the cup holder and surges over to plant a cold kiss to Eddie\u2019s mouth. \u201cI missed you today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour night patrol lasted less than an hour,\u201d Eddie retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Eddie tucks his own beer away and cups Steve\u2019s cheeks, pulls him in, kisses him hard and quick. \u201cCan we go inside now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you promise to keep kissing me?\u201d Steve gasps, a sweetheart among men.</p>\n<p>Eddie gets up, goes to crawl through his window. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow me and find out?\u201d</p>\n<p>They tumble into his room, and Eddie takes off the mask in the safety of their home. </p>\n<p>Eddie categorizes the way Steve\u2019s hair sticks up on the sides, the way he hastily tries to flatten it before Eddie notices. The stretch of the nylon when Eddie pulls it down, the soft hair on Steve\u2019s chest, the way Steve lets Eddie turn him so he\u2019s the one between a body and a bed.</p>\n<p>And he looks so pretty, lying beneath Eddie. Lean muscle under the surface of soft skin. Patches of scars and scrapes and bruises that Eddie longs to memorize with hands and tongue and teeth. </p>\n<p>He sounds like an angel, and he smells like one too (\u201cCelestial Moisturizer,\u201d Steve had sighed into Eddie\u2019s mouth. \u201cAlmond and dove orchid\u2013\u201d and Eddie had shut him up with an open mouth kiss.)</p>\n<p>Behind Eddie, sitting in a crumpled heap on the floor, is a suit of red and blue.</p>\n<p>But beneath Eddie is a boy he loves more than anything in the entire world, skin pinched a ravishing pink. </p>\n<p>Between the two, it really isn\u2019t a hard decision at all.</p>"
