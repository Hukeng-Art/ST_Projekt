  "text": "<p>Jaskier is born to a virgin mother.</p>\n<p>It sounds much more dramatic than it is, really. His birth progresses much the same as any other, with a lot of screaming and a lot of blood and far too much unidentifiable gunk. Perhaps the strangest thing about it, apart from the fact that it occurs without the involvement of a father, on a raised stone dais in a sacred cave under total planetary alignment, is that he remembers it.</p>\n<p>Remembers that first lungful of cool, midnight air. The heat of his mother\u2019s body replaced by the rough touch of stone. The silver coin of the moon glowing through a hole in the cave\u2019s ceiling. The sting of life, of <em>magic</em>, spreading in his tiny extremities. It hurts, being born, more than anything that Jaskier feels before it (for he does, vaguely, remember a <em>before</em>), and more than anything he feels after. He remembers the hurt, and the night, and the priests, crowding around the dais, touching him with reverent hands, wiping him clean of his mother\u2019s blood and raising him to the moon, christening him <em>god-begot, god-begot, god-begot</em>.</p>\n<p>He is not called Julian Pankratz until much, much later, and not called Jaskier for a good while after that. <em>Dandelion</em> as a moniker, he earns earlier, when he saves one of the first cities of man from a year without harvest. The spell he uses goes a bit wonky, which he thinks he can\u2019t be blamed for given that he\u2019s just written it, and as a side effect all the gardens in a thousand league radius are shot through with dandelions, those most charming of yellow-flowered weeds.</p>\n<p><em>Dandelion</em> is much easier to remember than his real name, the one the priests bestowed upon him after his mother\u2019s death on the dais, which is long and cumbersome and supposedly meaningful. He likes being named after a flower, after his own happy mistake. People greet him with joy, spill out of their front doors to crowd around him in the town square, calling, <em>Dandelion! Dandelion!,</em> imploring him wet their dry wells, heal their son\u2019s broken leg, call home their wayward mule. These little bits of magic he does without much thought, without effort, and for that the people love him. His name travels across the continent in children\u2019s songs, prayers; <em>oh, dear, you\u2019ve torn your skirts. best hope Dandelion dances along to mend them, or you\u2019ll be spending all day inside with needle and thread.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t mind helping; in fact, he quite likes it, so he sets himself up in a quiet hamlet in a valley near a lake and makes it no secret that he lives in the cottage with the green door. He hears petitioners, as many as he can, and helps the ones that are good-hearted. They come from across the continent, from the realms of elves and dwarves and dryads, and some of them come with armies, with swords and arrows and fire, wanting to take from him by force that which he will not give willingly, but Jaskier always feels their ill-intent from leagues away. He enchants the forest to ensnare them, spells the village invisible, stands fast before the wave of their fire and sends it roaring back at them.</p>\n<p>The people of the hamlet look upon him as something separate from themselves, something ancient and mystical and wise. Jaskier has never claimed to be very wise, but given the circumstances of his birth he can\u2019t deny a certain mysticism, and given the fact that he\u2019s lived nearly a hundred years, he supposes he can\u2019t very well deny the \u201cancient\u201d part either.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>At night, he spins round the fire thrumming his lute, singing songs he remembers from his childhood, songs the trees and brooks and birds sang to him when no one else was listening. The villagers and the petitioners dance with him, rosy-cheeked and smiling, eyes alight with the flames and the gleam of pure unadulterated happiness, touching his shoulders and reaching for his face and laughing delightedly when he reaches back. Jaskier loves them, all of them, in a wholehearted and uncomplicated way that he\u2019s never before experienced, and they love him in return.</p>\n<p>When the priests come for him, murmuring <em>god-begot, god-begot, god-begot</em>, he doesn\u2019t sense their approach. They hide their minds from him, and stalk between the cottages, wolves in a henhouse, dark cloaks and shadows trailing after them like smoke.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier fled, decades ago, ran from that cave that had been his nursery with the clothes on his back and nothing else, and he thought he\u2019d seen the last of them. But then he wakes in the middle of the night, in his cottage with the green door, one of the village children tucked sleepily against his side (she\u2019d had a nightmare, asked for a lullaby), and he sees them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier strikes out without thinking.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know, when he does, that they\u2019ve enchanted themselves. He doesn\u2019t know that stopping their hearts will release a maelstrom of fire like nothing he\u2019s ever seen, flames burning blue and impossibly hot, licking across the eaves of every cottage in the hamlet before he even has a chance to get out of bed. He doesn\u2019t know that it will be magical fire, that he won\u2019t be able to do anything to stop it, that it won\u2019t touch him, won\u2019t dare touch the <em>god-begot</em> Dandelion. That he\u2019ll scream every spell he knows, lungs burning with smoke, but the screams of his people will be louder, so loud that he can hardly even hear the flames, that he\u2019ll break in half right there in the village square, that he\u2019ll see the little girl who had the nightmare come out of his cottage covered in flames and seize her up and run for the lake, that the water won\u2019t do anything. That she\u2019ll still burn.</p>\n<p>No one ever thinks the priests\u2019 fire killed him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s silent tears seed dandelions through the charred ruins of his home, and on the last day of his hundredth year, he starts walking. He finds every priest of the order that brought about his birth, and he takes their lives, pulls their hearts out with twists of his fingers and sweeps entire caravans off cliffs and vanishes all the air out of rooms where they sleep. They run from him, and the survivors build a fortress on the Isle of Thanedd, where Jaskier is too tired to follow them.</p>\n<p>Instead, he turns to the only pursuit which has ever made him happy: music. For a while he continues as Dandelion, singing to crowds who think he\u2019s only adopted the name of the most powerful sorcerer who ever lived, but then he gets involved in some business with re-directing a river to bring water to a city suffering from drought, and the jig is up. So he cuts off his topknot and starts calling himself Julian Pankratz, quits the taverns and the villages for the banquet halls of lavishly rich nobles, where he spends a century or two distracting himself with drink and silk and the simple carnal pleasure of being taken from behind while he\u2019s buried between a woman\u2019s legs. But it <em>is</em> a distraction, and that\u2019s all it is, because every time he closes his eyes he\u2019s holding a little girl\u2019s body while she burns, blue fire in front of his eyes and lakewater lapping at his waist.</p>\n<p>In the winter, when Geralt returns to Kaer Morhen, Jaskier turns into a tree.</p>\n<p>He finds he quite likes being a tree. It\u2019s a peaceful sort of existence, letting the snow light softly on his branches and not feeling the cold, having all the warm, small animals burrow up in his hollows and knots. He lets his mind drift and feels the earth through his roots, feels her sing to him, songs of death and rebirth, of how it feels to be touched by the sun like a dear old friend, how it hurts to circle the moon over and over, never allowed to touch.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>For all that he\u2019s had to do rather a lot of it in his long, long life, Jaskier despises waiting. Not for his own sake, but for the sake of those around him. He knows how little time they have, how brief their stays are on this earth, and even though it\u2019s true that Witchers live longer than most, he does not like to be away from Geralt for too long. Every second apart feels like time wasted. Time passes easier as a tree. So he waits by the road to Kaer Morhen, and when he sees the buds start to poke from the frozen earth, sees Roach come trotting down the path, the Witcher setting back out into the world, he waits for Geralt to pass, turns back into himself, and portals to meet him at the first village.</p>\n<p>Jaskier didn\u2019t see Geralt coming, is the odd thing. That day they met, the dingy tavern and the table in the corner, Geralt grunting out monosyllabic answers, Jaskier had no idea to expect him. Usually when he meets people who\u2019ll be important to him, he gets an inkling before he sees them, a flash of their face in his dreams, an echo of their future conversations. But with Geralt, there was nothing. Jaskier only looked over, and saw him, white hair, golden eyes, and knew instinctively, in the same way he could sense danger ahead or a storm coming, that Geralt was the person he\u2019d been waiting for since that night so many hundreds of years ago, when he\u2019d been born.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s been pretending to be human for so long now that he hardly remembers what it feels like to be a sorcerer. He doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to remember what it feels like to be a sorcerer. Down that path lies only pain and madness. But people still murmur his name with reverence in certain dim halls; <em>Dandelion, Dandelion</em>, destroyer of worlds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Sometimes, alone at night while Geralt rides out after whatever monster, Jaskier misses the days when people knew him as a helper, someone who healed scraped knees and made gardens bloom. He survives as a household god in children\u2019s songs, playground games, but it\u2019s not the same.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll never again know that simple, peaceful love that he felt with the villagers in that hamlet. His capacity for that sort of thing is gone. But some days, he wakes up to hear the birds chirping and Geralt murmuring <em>good morning </em>fondly to Roach, the Witcher\u2019s rumpled bedroll mere inches from his own, foggy memories of rolling together in the dark, sunlight splitting through the forest canopy and a warm spring breeze licking at his bare feet, and it\u2019s almost the same.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Being around Geralt makes him feel better. Less alone. Even though they don\u2019t ever talk about it (how could they, when Geralt doesn\u2019t even know what Jaskier is?), sometimes Jaskier holds his gaze over a tavern table and sees reflected back at him the exact same world-weariness, the same broken idealism, same unspoken desire to retreat from it all. Geralt\u2019s not kind, and he\u2019s not loving, but Jaskier has never needed either of those things. All he\u2019s ever needed is someone who won\u2019t leave him.</p>\n<p>Turns out Geralt\u2019s not that, either.</p>\n<p>(\u201cCome to bed with me,\u201d Jaskier says. Not a question, really, except it is, it always is.</p>\n<p>Geralt considers him for a long moment. Jaskier already knows he\u2019s going to say no, but there\u2019s this look in his eyes, this considering look, like he\u2019s trying to figure Jaskier out. Trying to read between the lines. Jaskier wants to tell him there <em>is </em>no \u201cbetween the lines,\u201d there\u2019s only wanting Geralt, needing Geralt, being tired of waiting. But whatever the Witcher imagines he sees, it must not be what he wants, because he shakes his head slightly and says, \u201cNo.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Jaskier tries being a bird for a while, after Geralt leaves him on the mountain. He thinks maybe it will hurt less, if he\u2019s a bird. Figures birds don\u2019t have the sort of capacity for emotional pain that humans do. But he sails through the clear, open air, through turbulent rain clouds, across mountain ranges and oceans, over parts of the world where no mortal man has set foot, where strange creatures move in primordial fog and the voices of old gods clatter like swords in the darkness, and no matter how far he travels, his thoughts return always to Geralt. To miserable, muddy treks, to monsters and coin purses and leagues and leagues of Geralt\u2019s wordless grumbling, muttering spells under his breath to soothe his sore feet and fix Roach\u2019s loose shoe, strumming songs in the tavern until dawn and creeping up creaky stairs, slipping into a rented room to find Geralt face-down in bed, his back moving up and down with the bellows of his breath, their things spread out on the table.</p>\n<p>Probably the most commonly known pitfall of eternal life is the loneliness. Having to watch your loved ones grow old and pass into the next world without you, seeing the world change and evolve and remembering when it was young, when cities were just villages and wars were just careless words exchanged across royal banquet halls. Until Jaskier came along he\u2019s not sure anyone knew, though, this dimension of immortality. He thinks he\u2019s the first person aside from the old gods to live to see his five hundredth birthday, his thousandth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>His time as a tree never feels like isolation, with the forest creatures and the earth to talk to. But as a bird, soaring far above the earth, watching men and elves and sorcerers toil away like ants on the side of a mountain, his blurry underdeveloped eyes seeing forests tiny like thickets of grass and lakes tiny like puddles and cities tiny like piles of shells on the beach, he feels, illogically, like no one has ever touched him, not in any way that mattered. Not in any way that <em>stuck</em>. And maybe this has always been his fate; to wander the earth, and the skies, and the seas, alone.</p>\n<p>A month or a year later, when Jaskier finally stumbles back into society, human and still fighting the phantom impression that he has wings, he finds out Yennefer is dead. He can count the number of times he\u2019s actually met the sorceress on one hand, but he knows Geralt cares about her, and to Jaskier that\u2019s a more important qualifier anyways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He lies awake in the goosedown bed in his apartments in Oxenfurt, surrounded by lavish furnishings purchased with a few lifetimes worth of gold, and can\u2019t sleep, thinking of Geralt. Lurking in shadows in crowded taverns, golden eyes flashing over a pint of ale, nursing a broken heart but too manly and stoic to even go fuck it out of his system, since that would require admitting to himself he has a broken heart in the first place. It hurts, and not because Jaskier can\u2019t imagine Geralt ever being torn up over his own death (well, not <em>only</em> because of that); it hurts because Jaskier\u2019s not there. Jaskier can\u2019t poke at Geralt like taunting an angry bear until he lashes out and forgets his pain, he can\u2019t listen to Geralt breathe steadily through the night, can\u2019t roll over, feigning sleep, and press his foot to Geralt\u2019s leg when he feels him come silently awake in the small hours of the morning. He can\u2019t even go to him, because Geralt doesn\u2019t want him there. He told him himself.</p>\n<p>So Jaskier, who\u2019s been at Oxenfurt for the better part of summer already, lecturing at the university and playing an enticing game of cat and mouse with some representatives from Aretuza who\u2019ve somehow caught wind that Dandelion might be in the city, picks up and heads for Yennefer\u2019s last known location. The battlefield is charred and littered with bodies, and for a moment as Jaskier stands in what looks like the center of the blast, he remembers standing in the aftermath of a much different fire.</p>\n<p>A single dandelion sprouts near his foot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, sort of charmed. He hasn\u2019t accidentally sprouted any flowers in a long while. It\u2019s a weak little thing, swaying in the breeze, and he takes pity. \u201cDon\u2019t even try it, love, trust me.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He crushes it under the heel of his boot.</p>\n<p>Yennefer comes back into the world screaming, furious. Jaskier\u2019s a bit winded; it\u2019s difficult business, bringing someone back to life when you don\u2019t have a body to stick them in, and on top of that Geralt\u2019s sorceress was rather stubborn about being magicked out of the afterlife. Probably a point of professional pride or something, since the second she sees Jaskier standing over her with his doublet rended open and the wet blood of the earth smeared across his chest, she tosses a mean defensive spell at him and spits, \u201c<em>You.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs and bats the spell out of existence before it can reach him. \u201cHonestly, I know we never got on all that well, but I think a \u2018thank you\u2019 would be in order.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer doesn\u2019t answer him. She\u2019s staring at something just beyond him on the ground, wide-eyed and pale, and for a moment Jaskier thinks there must be a horrible beast creeping up on him, but then he turns around and sees a field of yellow weeds, flowering gently. His shoulders relax, then tense up again almost immediately. Yennefer, if she\u2019s heard the stories, and she must have, will know who he is, and he doesn\u2019t want to have to reinvent himself again, not when Geralt knows <em>this</em> him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says, still staring at the dandelions, wondering if he can possibly be fast enough to crush all of them under his boot and claim she was only imaginging things. \u201cThis, well,\u201d he clears his throat. \u201cI\u2019d spin one of my legendary stories, but frankly I\u2019m not sure I could offer any excuses that would satisfy a sorceress such as yourself.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He turns back to look at her then. Yennefer is watching him warily, sprawled out with her weight on her arms, dress wet and heavy with the blood of the earth. There\u2019s a look on her face caught halfway between respect and jealousy. Jaskier wipes his chest clean as best he can with a spare scrap of scarf, buttons his doublet, and tries to ignore the pressure of her gaze.</p>\n<p>(\u201cAre you sure your human is just a normal human?\u201d he hears her ask, across the campfire. The night and the mountain big and ominous around, the troupe of midgets cackling raucously over a dirty joke, Yennefer bent close to Geralt in the shadows.</p>\n<p>Jaskier tries to stop listening, tries to look as innocuously, condemnably human as possible while he puts a leg up on a log and starts to strum for the jolly campers. But he still hears Geralt, almost amused, \u201cWho, Jaskier? He\u2019s as normal as they come.\u201d)</p>\n<p>He offers Yennefer a hand up. She refuses it, gets up on her own, brushes herself off. Jaskier expects a hundred questions, half of them about Geralt and his intentions. He expects her to toss more battle magic at him and try to drag him back to Aretuza. He expects her, maybe, to turn on her heel and portal out of here without a word, leaving him to wonder whether his life is about to be upended, or whether he can go on being Jaskier a little longer. What he doesn\u2019t expect is for her to size him up and ask, \u201cThe legends say your mother was a virgin. Is that true?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a cat when he approaches the cabin, because dogs aren\u2019t his style.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s on the far outskirts of a village up near the edge of the plains, where bands of nomadic horsemen hunt hulking animals called bison. There\u2019s a clothesline outside, and a bale of hay that\u2019s been sacrificed to archery practice, and Jaskier doesn\u2019t see any sign of Roach but he <em>does </em>smell fresh bread cooking inside, and the tracking spell he cast was very accurate, so he positions himself on the sill of an open window and yowls. It\u2019s not Geralt that ducks into view, however, but a young girl, with blonde hair and inquisitive blue eyes, who smiles delightedly to see him.</p>\n<p>She lifts him inside and lets him sit on the kitchen table while she bustles about cleaning up the flour, stopping every so often to come over and pat his head and tell him what a handsome cat he is. Jaskier wouldn\u2019t say he basks under the attention, but he\u2019s always loved this kind and unsuspicious way children have with animals, and anyway the cabin smells like Geralt so he\u2019s quite content to wait here as long as she\u2019ll let him. He even pushes his luck, after a few hours have passed and the bread\u2019s come off the fire, and hops down to push his nose into a pair of leather pants, halfway mended, hung over the back of a chair. He hadn\u2019t realized quite how terrible he felt, how big a piece of himself he must have left with Geralt on that mountain, until he buries his feline nose in Geralt\u2019s scent and suddenly feels alright again. It\u2019s a marked difference.</p>\n<p>The girl <em>shoo</em>s him away a second later, but she still doesn\u2019t chase him out of the cabin, so when Roach comes thundering out of the grasslands, when Geralt dismounts and stalks up the steps and drops a perfunctory kiss on the girl\u2019s head, muttering, \u201cCiri,\u201d he\u2019s still hiding under one of the kitchen chairs. Geralt turns a look on him like he\u2019s one nuisance on top of a thousand others, the same look he used to give to horrible monsters, and says, \u201cWhat did I say about the frogs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a frog,\u201d the girl, Ciri, points out reasonably. \u201cHe\u2019s a cat, and he\u2019s lovely.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>One night,</em> Jaskier tells himself, once Geralt has posed no more argument, rolled his eyes heavenward, and tromped up the narrow staircase to the loft. <em>One night, </em>as Ciri flashes him a triumphant smile between the table legs, reaching for him, and he goes. <em>One night</em>, sleeping hidden in Geralt\u2019s house with this little family he seems to have built for himself, a few uninterrupted hours of joy and comfort that he can tuck away in his heart for later, and then he\u2019ll turn back into a human.</p>\n<p>In the end, he gives himself a full week.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s never claimed to be particularly strong in matters of willpower, and refusing himself things. And that first morning, when Geralt rolls out of the loft still half-asleep, eyelids heavy and white hair loose and tousled around his face, he lumbers past Jaskier, curled on the kitchen table, and runs his fingers absently over his head. It\u2019s a fraction of a second, Geralt\u2019s big Witcher hand on Jaskier\u2019s delicate cat skull, but Jaskier thinks it may be the best thing he\u2019s ever felt.</p>\n<p>Being a cat is a peaceful existence, as, it seems, is being Geralt of Rivia. These days, all he seems to do is rise in the morning, watch Ciri fondly while she fumbles about with a bow and arrow, and go to bed at night. Jaskier feels a bit cheated, at first, that he never got to partake in this particular Geralt, soft and gentle and quick to smile (with his eyes); then, later, curled up on Geralt\u2019s lap while he nurses a flagon of ale on the porch after Ciri\u2019s gone to bed, he figures there\u2019s no good reason why he <em>can\u2019t</em>. For a while, at least. He can let Ciri feed him scraps of bread under the table, let himself be pet and loved and cared for and christened, in a sick twist of fate, <em>Dandelion</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>(\u201cIt has <em>lion</em> in the name,\u201d Ciri defends, when Geralt questions her choice.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not much of a lion,\u201d Geralt judges, casting Jaskier a disdainful look, but Jaskier\u2019s well used to his disdainful looks, and only yowls indignantly in response.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s when he finds himself seriously considering cleaning himself in full view of both of them that he decides it\u2019s probably time to switch back. He waits until Geralt rides into town for some supplies, then snags a blanket off the clothesline and runs away from Ciri as she chases after him, gets himself tangled up in the blanket, and emerges a man. Ciri startles back, eyes wide and mouth pressed into a tight line, and that\u2019s why Jaskier wanted the blanket; he didn\u2019t want to alarm her any more than absolutely necessary, and certainly not in that way. She looks like she might be considering running to yell after Geralt, but he\u2019s already been gone an hour. Her eyes dart to the bow and arrow.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Jaskier says, holding up his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a cat,\u201d Ciri observes. She\u2019s prone to obvious declarations, but in this instance Jaskier can\u2019t really blame her. He\u2019s not, after all, a cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Jaskier,\u201d he says, trying to sound non-threatening. \u201cMaybe Geralt mentioned me. I used to be his bard. You know; <em>toss a coin to your Witcher,</em> and all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt returns at sunset to find Jaskier still sitting under that same blanket, plucking away at a makeshift lute fashioned from a pail and some spare bowstrings. He pulls Roach to a stop at the edge of the yard, eyes sharp and alert like they get when he\u2019s expecting a fight. Jaskier flashes his gaze over to him, but doesn\u2019t stop his song, because Ciri\u2019s smiling beatifically where she\u2019s laying in the grass next to him, dandelions wound in her hair, and he thinks to stop his song would be more of an admission of guilt than he\u2019s willing to offer, anyways.</p>\n<p>He listens to Geralt\u2019s boots hit the ground as he dismounts. Listens to him lead Roach over to the stable, the creak of the old wood door, Roach\u2019s grouchy huffs as Geralt loosens his girth and takes off his tack. He listens to Geralt come back out of the stable, close the door, hesitate for a long minute, and then stalk over to loom over them while Jaskier trills out the last notes of his song: the ballad of the White Wolf, of course. What else would he sing, here.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finished, Geralt clears his throat. \u201cCiri,\u201d he says. \u201cGo wait inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>She starts to protest, then sees the look on Geralt\u2019s face and must think better of it, because she just gets up, dusts herself off, and hurries inside. Jaskier\u2019s not worried about what she might say; he\u2019s already sworn her to secrecy on the him-being-the-cat front, and he gets the sense that she\u2019s the sort of child who enjoys keeping secrets from her guardian. (\u201cDoes Geralt know you can turn into a cat? He never mentioned you were a sorcerer. If it\u2019s a secret, I won\u2019t tell. I\u2019m ace at secrets.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Jaskier sets his bucket lute aside. Geralt\u2019s still standing over him, and Jaskier feels, nonsensically, like if he looks up at his face he\u2019ll split clean in two pieces, so instead he\u2019s looking straight at Geralt\u2019s knees. He tries to address them as seriously as he would his face. \u201cGeralt. I know you said you never wanted to see me again, but I thought you\u2019d like to know Yennefer is alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cShe was here.\u201d His voice sounds oddly tense, even by his standards.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>\u201cDid anyone follow you here? Anyone from Nilfgaard?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaskier answers, and he does look up at Geralt then, involuntarily, and the panic-tinged look on his face nearly topples him, for all that he\u2019s still sitting. \u201cNo, Geralt, never. I would never have come if there was the chance I would lead them to you. I swear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt breathes out a huge, blusterly breath. Jaskier\u2019s reminded, in a gut punch of sense memory, of the last breath Geralt takes before settling in to go to sleep, always a labored, behemoth thing. \u201cGood,\u201d the Witcher says when he\u2019s recovered, and offers Jaskier a hand up. Jaskier takes it, lets himself be tugged off the ground, wraps the blanket around his waist and prays Geralt won\u2019t think to ask where his clothes are. Prays Geralt doesn\u2019t hate him enough to send him back out into the world naked as a babe, though he supposes he could make the return journey to Oxenfurt as a cat, as well.</p>\n<p>Another thought strikes him. \u201cDid Yennefer tell you how she came to be, ah, <em>alive</em> again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt smiles. Actually smiles, with his mouth as well as his eyes. \u201cAlways fishing for a song, aren\u2019t you, Jaskier. No, Yen didn\u2019t say, even when I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s not sure whether that bodes ill or well. But Geralt leads him inside, fetches him a shirt and a pair of leggings, instructs Ciri to set him a place at the table and doesn\u2019t tell Jaskier to leave this place and never return, all of which bodes very well indeed. And after Ciri has gone to bed (after he fetches his pail from outside and plucks her a few songs, none about Cintra, as per Geralt\u2019s decree, but a few that he learned from the birds and one from when he and Geralt used to travel together), Geralt invites Jaskier up to the loft with a look that speaks volumes, rolls out an extra bedroll (why does he have an extra? is it Yennefer\u2019s?), and positions it between his and Ciri\u2019s. Geralt, he knows, likes to be between his companions and the door, best positioned to protect them, and Jaskier\u2019s not about to disabuse him of the notion that he needs protecting, so he lays down without a word.</p>\n<p>Part of him is still expecting Geralt to snap out of whatever idyllic trance he\u2019s in and boot Jaskier out the front door. Part of him wants it to happen, because at least then it would be over with. At least then he wouldn\u2019t be balancing on this razor\u2019s edge between contentment and annihilation. But Geralt reaches out and puts his hand on Jaskier in the dark, on his stomach, and tugs at him, only a little, just enough to pull him a few inches closer. Jaskier can feel the heat of him in the dark. He imagines hooded figures standing over him in scant moonlight. <em>God-begot, god-begot, god-begot.</em> Just let him have this, please. Let him have it for a while, before it gets ripped away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time I tell you I hate you,\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice is more pressure than sound in the close, muggy space between their faces, \u201cdon\u2019t listen to me. Stay anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier searches Geralt\u2019s face, trying to read between the lines, but it\u2019s too dim to see. He can feel, well enough, Geralt\u2019s fingers digging into his stomach. The tension in Geralt\u2019s body beside him, the same as every time Jaskier\u2019s been injured in his company. \u201cI will,\u201d he promises. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt rumbles in acknowledgement, breathes out that big blustery breath, and settles down to sleep.</p>\n<p>A few months later, when Jaskier\u2019s settled into the cabin and fashioned himself a real lute from some yew wood Geralt packed back from the village, when Ciri\u2019s gotten bored of making <em>pspspsps</em> noises at Jaskier behind Geralt\u2019s back every time he turns around, when the farmsteads around them have turned to harvest and the horsemen have started returning for the winter, Geralt turns to him after supper and says, \u201cYou meant it, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The loft has gone silent above them; Ciri\u2019s stopped rolling over and over in her quest for sleep. Geralt\u2019s elbow-deep in the washbasin, scrubbing their dishes clean. Jaskier\u2019s wrapping what\u2019s left of the loaf of bread they had with their stew, not as deft with twine and wax paper as he is with an instrument, but he stops when he hears Geralt\u2019s voice. \u201cThat I\u2019d stay? Of course I meant it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Geralt shakes his head once, just briefly, and meets Jaskier\u2019s gaze for a fraction of a second. Jaskier suddenly knows exactly what he\u2019s talking about, the same way he knew when he first met him all those years ago: instinctively. Geralt pulls his arms out of the washbasin, slick with water, and wipes them down with a rag. \u201cYears ago. You asked me to go to bed with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart beats triple-time in his chest, like it\u2019s playing a Redanian jig. He swallows, trying to get the feeling to go away, but it won\u2019t. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he says. His throat feels shaky, but he tries to say it with as much calming conviction as he can manage, carefully, because the Witcher is bestowing upon him a great gift, and he doesn\u2019t want to break it, or treat it as anything less than it is. \u201cYes. I meant it. It\u2019s quite possible I\u2019ve never meant anything more.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>And Geralt can\u2019t know how significant a statement that is, can\u2019t know that Jaskier burnt an entire order of priests of the old religion to the ground, screaming <em>I hate you, I hate you, I hate you</em>, that he once stood over a raging river, told it to change course, and it obeyed, that he sang a song a thousand years ago and called all the fields in the continent to harvest. But he must still hear its weight, its human importance, because he sets the rag aside, something gone soft in the line of his brow, takes Jaskier\u2019s face in his hands, and kisses him. Jaskier fists one hand in Geralt\u2019s shirt, slides one around the wide trunk of his body, and presses close against him, feeling the earth go quiet under them and the eyeblink of night stretch yawning and fathomless outside, feeling small and right and normal as they come.</p>\n<p>Yennefer arrives in the dead of winter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier supposes it was just wishful thinking to hope that she might stay away. He\u2019s settled in, here, in a way that he hasn\u2019t since that first hamlet in that first valley. At night, when Ciri shocks awake from a nightmare, he holds her until she falls back to sleep; she does the same for him, her nimble fingers twisting his hair into braids, soothing as the breeze, the steady tide of Geralt\u2019s breathing rising and falling in the dark next to them. Sometimes he\u2019ll tromp down to the village to sing around the bonfire, testing a new tune he\u2019s been humming all week, and as the townspeople twirl around and around the fire with him, he\u2019ll catch a glimpse of Geralt, lurking on the outskirts, hiding a smile. It\u2019s more difficult now that the snow has fallen, since they can\u2019t just nip off into the tall grass, but whenever they can steal a spare moment, they spirit each other away to relearn bodies they\u2019ve known for decades through averted eyes and accidental touches with hands, mouths, teeth.</p>\n<p>Since Jaskier knows he doesn\u2019t get an ending, not really, he thinks this is his happy chapter. His happy epilogue, maybe, before the second book, until he wakes one morning, splashes water on his face, and gives himself a look in the warped mirror hung over the basin (one of Ciri\u2019s royal-minded purchases), and finds a gray hair. He runs it between his fingers, debating plucking it out, but in the end he leaves it in and thinks, <em>maybe, after all</em>. Maybe.</p>\n<p>But then, while he\u2019s heaving a hay bale down from the loft in the barn for Roach, he feels something crash against his protective wards, and hears Yennefer yell, <em>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>His blood runs cold. Swearing under his breath, he slides down the ladder and runs out into the snow, at the same moment as Geralt is coming out of the cabin, bundled up in his cloak. They both spot Yennefer at the same time, stuck fast on the far side of the yard like she\u2019s come up against an invisible wall. She has. It was probably petty of Jaskier, not to include her in the wards, since he knows she\u2019d never willingly harm Geralt or Ciri, but just as he\u2019s never claimed to be wise, he\u2019s never claimed to be immune from pettiness. She throws herself against them, with the weight of her body and the weight of magic, but it\u2019s no use. The wards hold. They\u2019d hold against an army.</p>\n<p>\u201cYen.\u201d Geralt comes down off the porch and rushes over to her, concerned. Before he can reach her, Jaskier waves his hand to drop the wards, unseen by anyone but Yennefer herself. She drops forward into the yard, and into Geralt\u2019s waiting arms. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>She shoves him off almost immediately, muttering something about not being a swooning damsel, but still, in that brief moment, Jaskier looks at the way Geralt holds her and wonders if he\u2019s not just acting as a stand-in. It\u2019s a hard feeling to shake, especially when Yennefer shakes snow off her skirts and invites herself into the house like it\u2019s nothing, when Ciri leaps on her with an ecstatic hug, when Geralt offers no response except to grumble a bit and stomp snow off his own boots. He supposes he can be glad, at least, that no one mentions the wards. He bustles about in the kitchen under the pretense of everyone needing a hot cup of tea, listens to chairs scrape as they settle in at the table, Ciri assailing Yennefer with a barrage of questions about Aretuza and the court and <em>have you fought any more great battles, Yen?</em> He\u2019s still in the kitchen, his back to the lot of them, when there\u2019s a lull in the conversation and Geralt finally asks, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, not happy to see me?\u201d she teases, then, before he can come up with an answer: \u201cThere\u2019s a new war on. The <em>Aen Elle</em> have pierced the veil between worlds, at a place far to the north of the Dragon Mountains. They\u2019re coming through in droves, assembling an army. We suspect they plan to march on Kovir when the snow melts.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Geralt gives her a guarded look as Jaskier sets the kettle on the table, like he\u2019s warning her not to revisit some past argument. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you expect me to do about that, Yen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Yennefer says, and Jaskier\u2019s stomach plummets. \u201cI need to borrow your bard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt tenses. Jaskier feels the sharp jab of his alarm, a knife to tender flesh, fingers on oversensitive skin, if the skin were his heart. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he starts to say, placating, at the same moment that Geralt pushes his chair back, stands, and orders, \u201cGet out of my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer pauses, surprised, in the middle of pouring out a cup of tea. For a heartbeat, she\u2019s so frozen that it seems like she might actually have been cowed by Geralt\u2019s tone, but then she slams the kettle back down, jostling the table (Jaskier\u2019s been meaning to mend that uneven leg), and makes the inadvisable decision to get up in Geralt\u2019s face. The argument that ensues shakes the entire house, makes Ciri roll her eyes and go wait it out with Roach in the stable, and eventually becomes so violent that it spills out into the yard. Jaskier trails out onto the porch to watch it, not really wanting to get involved, bits of lyrics running through his head like shadow puppetry, something about passion burning so hot it will destroy them both, but then Geralt gets Yennefer by the neck and looks like he might be about to actually throw her, so Jaskier hurries off the porch.</p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt!\u201d he snaps, rushing toward them through the snow. \u201cGeralt, don\u2019t.\u201d But Geralt\u2019s in a rage, and he never listens when he\u2019s in a rage, hand tightening around Yennefer\u2019s throat while she tries to scratch out his eyes, so Jaskier snaps a nasty little spell, one that he used to use to separate quarreling children, and they fly apart as if yanked by invisible strings. They hit the ground hard, and for a moment Jaskier feels no shame at all, standing between them and breathing fast, even though it wasn\u2019t a difficult spell at all, flushed with the exhiliration of finally, <em>finally</em>, acting his age.</p>\n<p>Then Geralt rolls back around. His golden eyes find Jaskier, concerned and confused, but with an edge of hurt that makes Jaskier feel worse than he did on that mountain, worse that when he let Geralt drag him all over the continent after the djinn stole his voice, still pretending to be helpless out of some sick sense of karma. \u201cGeralt.\u201d He straightens, swallows. \u201cI could explain, but I think it would be easier if we all just went with Yennefer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer, who\u2019s found her feet and is brushing off her dress as if she\u2019s done nothing more than have a bit of a fall in the street, deigns to give him a grateful, if grudging, look. Geralt stares at Jaskier for another long moment, looking like he\u2019s caught halfway between wanting to run him through with his sword and wanting to force him back inside the cabin, nods once, and stands.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier reinforces the wards around the cabin while Yennefer looks on with interest and Ciri watches from the cracked stable door with wide eyes. Geralt\u2019s deliberately not watching him, strapping on his armor on the front porch, his sword, his knives. The silence is deafening, but Jaskier feels one wrong word away from bursting into tears, so he doesn\u2019t try to break it. Instead, when he\u2019s done, he turns back to the cabin and gazes upon it for a long minute, at the crooked eaves and the bucket lute that\u2019s sat on the porch, full of snow, at the patch of siding that he and Ciri managed to paint green before Geralt came home and put an end to it, at the single tree in the plains beyond, where in the fall Geralt had laid him back on a blanket and pressed inside him for the first time while birds sang and flitted between the amber leaves. It might be the last time he ever sees this place. He wants to remember it.</p>\n<p>They step out of Yennefer\u2019s portal on the side of a mountain.</p>\n<p>The sorcerers of Aretuza have set up forward camp on a narrow ledge overlooking a steep drop. Snow and wind howl around them, like they\u2019re in the belly of some horrible beast, but they\u2019re only outside for a moment before Yennefer pulls aside the flap of a tent and leads them inside. Jaskier brushes snow off his shoulders and tries to ignore the stony, silent presence of Geralt at his shoulder. There are eyes on him, a lot of eyes, men and women who look like they\u2019ve been awake for days, gathered in this tent. A sorceress he vaguely recognizes as having shadowed him through the streets of Oxenfurt a lifetime ago steps forward and offers her hand. \u201cDandelion,\u201d she says. \u201cAretuza have been looking for you for five centuries. Figures Yennefer would find you completely by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p>He clasps her arm, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m a bit rusty,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sorceress\u2019 eyes soften with fond amusement. She knows, then, that he\u2019s only being humble.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>She shows him to a map, enchanted to show the location of the passage between worlds and the steady stream of dark elves streaming through it. The rest of the socerers crowd around him, some with<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>professional interest, some with open-faced admiration, some with doubtful suspicion. Jaskier looks up briefly, seeking one particular person, and finds Geralt next to Yennefer, watching him from the back of the tent near the door. He holds his gaze for a moment, willing Geralt not to turn right around and leave, willing him to give Jaskier a chance to explain, when this is all over, because he can\u2019t spare the time to do it now. There are people that need his help, and Jaskier has never been able to refuse a good-hearted petitioner. \u201cRight,\u201d he turns back to the map. \u201cRight, what about this mountain, here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They arrive back at the cabin in silence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Yennefer doesn\u2019t come with them. Jaskier hardly needs her to portal them around, now that Geralt knows what he is. He\u2019s tired, but it had only taken him a matter of minutes to repair the veil between worlds and collapse an entire mountain on the rest of the army, so he has enough energy left in him to bring them home, to put on a brave face and a smile for Ciri, who, as usual, is full of questions and righteous indignation at having been left behind. He gets her to bed as Geralt sits silently at the kitchen table, brushes his thumb across her hairline and presses a kiss to her forehead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It might be the last time he ever gets to do that, but he tries not to let the sense of <em>goodbye</em> come across in his actions. He descends the ladder to the main floor of the house, shaky and nauseous, and joins Geralt at the table. He\u2019s surprised Geralt lets him sit. Surprised he doesn\u2019t kick the chair out in anger when Jaskier goes to sit down. But then Geralt looks up at him, and Jaskier realizes with a start that he\u2019s not angry at all. \u201cYou were the cat,\u201d he says.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs, and laughs, drunk with relief, then breaks off with something almost like a sob. \u201cI was the cat,\u201d he agrees, weakly. \u201cI should have told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d Geralt asks, but still he sounds contemplative, curious, not angry. \u201cI think we both know I\u2019m the last person who\u2019d have a problem with you being a sorcerer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier drags a hand over his face. He\u2019s suddenly exhausted. \u201cI\u2019m not just a sorcerer, Geralt. I\u2019ve been alive for, gods, I don\u2019t even know how long. Since before there were cities. Before there were Witchers. I never learned magic, I wrote most of it, and I might not have any idea what I am but I\u2019m certainly not human, I\u2019ve spent too much time as a tree to be human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Geralt says, steadfast, unfazed by any of it. \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Jaskier says, and is surprised to realize he means it. \u201cI was scared to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Geralt asks, quiet and gentle, and not only because he\u2019s trying not to wake Ciri. Jaskier\u2019s eyes are warm, and wet, and to his horror he feels tears start to run down his cheeks, such a deluge of them that he\u2019s helpless to do anything but wipe at them with the back of his hands and stare down at the table and hope Geralt doesn\u2019t notice. But Geralt does notice. Of course he does. He makes a noise in the back of his throat like someone\u2019s stabbed him (<em>stabbed</em> him, because Geralt never makes noise when he\u2019s hurt unless it\u2019s dire) and comes around the table to kneel in front of Jaskier\u2019s chair. He puts his big hand on the side of Jaskier\u2019s head, and Jaskier turns his face into it, hiding in Geralt\u2019s palm until Geralt pulls him to the edge of the chair and takes Jaskier brusquely in his arms. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you,\u201d he asks again, sounding tight and urgent, chin pressed hard to the top of Jaskier\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>And Jaskier has to answer. He can\u2019t keep lying to Geralt anymore, even if it means he has to stop lying to himself, as well. \u201cSometimes I like to feel small,\u201d he admits, thick with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s all so much, and sometimes I want to feel like I\u2019m not important, like I\u2019m just a bard, just human. You made me feel like that, and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jaskier</em>,\u201d Geralt murmurs against Jaskier\u2019s hair. He doesn\u2019t say anything else, just keeps holding him, and Jaskier figures he doesn\u2019t need to. What\u2019s there to say, anyways?</p>\n<p>Much later, after Jaskier\u2019s calmed down (after Geralt\u2019s bruised drugging kisses into his tearstained lips, smiled softly in the hot red-flushed space between their faces, unbuttoned Jaskier\u2019s doublet and unlaced his trousers and hunched over his lap, one hand over Jaskier\u2019s mouth so he couldn\u2019t make any more noise than a desperate, broken grunt as he came), they climb the ladder to the loft and lie down to sleep as they have every night for the past few months. Jaskier buries his face in Geralt\u2019s chest and tucks in close to the hulking warmth of him, feels the steady, contented beat of his heart through the loose shirt that he sleeps in, listens to the wind pushing fondly at the roof above their heads.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He remembers being a bird and being a god and being born, but earlier tonight when he\u2019d crouched and pressed his hands to the frozen dirt and muttered the twisting, ancient words that would bring a mountain to the ground, he had been thinking not of the sacred cave and not of the primordial fog and not of the fire that had blazed blue through his hamlet. He\u2019d been thinking, with a cold jolt of premature grief, of the way Geralt\u2019s bare toes had curled in the grass the first time Jaskier put his hand on him, the bitter taste of his sweat, the feeling of his wiry chest hair against Jaskier\u2019s lips. He\u2019d been thinking of Ciri\u2019s scraped knee, the sly joy in her eyes when he magicked it better, exhilirated to have one more secret to keep from Geralt, who they both loved.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He\u2019d been thinking of small things, a thousand small things, a lifetime\u2019s worth. And now, he slides his knee between Geralt\u2019s legs, surrounded entirely by the weight of the Witcher\u2019s body, and feels, as he has always, always yearned to feel, like a small thing himself.</p>"
