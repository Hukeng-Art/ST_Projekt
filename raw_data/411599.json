  "summary": "<p>For someone he'd hero-worshipped for so long, Steve Rogers in the flesh is a pretty big disappointment. For one thing, he keeps looking at Tony as though he reminds him of someone else, and even if he never says anything, Tony's pretty sure it's his father. A lifetime of not measuring up to Howard's expectations is more than enough, thank you very much, and he's certainly not going to make an effort to live up to any of Steve's. Steve's pretty clearly failed to live up to <i>his</i> expectations, in any case, and that's not hypocritical at <i>all</i>.</p>",

  "text": "<p>There\u2019s no two ways around it, meeting Captain America for the first time is a massive disappointment. Really, Tony should know by now that there\u2019s nothing that even minimally raised expectations can\u2019t ruin for him, and the fact that he\u2019s loved Cap since childhood with a sweetness and sincerity and \u2013 there\u2019s no other word for it \u2013 <i>pure-heartedness</i> unmatched by anything else in his life, only guaranteed he was setting himself up for a fall.</p>\n<p>He walks into the meeting room at Shield headquarters where Cap, no <i>Steve Rogers</i>, is waiting, and for about three seconds feels a surge of elated pride as they reach out to shake hands and Steve\u2019s eyes rake over him. He\u2019s been eyed up by the best, and there\u2019s no mistaking the look. Except that apparently there <i>is</i>, because Steve looks up again, gets a second look at his face, and visibly recoils, and then his hand falters and drops, leaving Tony\u2019s hanging there in hellish limbo.</p>\n<p>And okay, if he\u2019s honest with himself, he was half expecting it, he knows Rogers knew the old man, worked with him even, but Christ, the resemblance isn\u2019t <i>that</i> uncanny. The guy\u2019s been rendered speechless, for God\u2019s sake. Even Fury and Coulson start to look uncomfortable as the silence drags on.</p>\n<p>\u201cCatching flies there, Cap,\u201d he snaps \u2013 seriously, if he didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d think Steve Rogers was some kind of slack-jawed yokel \u2013 and pulls his own hand back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. I\u2026 Oh,\u201d Cap manages. Yeah. There\u2019s a leader of fighting men and an inspiration to us all.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still staring.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, look,\u201d Tony says, annoyed, \u201cI know I look like my dad, but seriously, get over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rogers pulls himself together and looks momentarily excited. His whole face lights up, and it does funny things to the part of Tony that had a creased and faded photo of him in his civvies, face shining, grin a mile wide, tucked into the corner of his dresser mirror all through grade school. It had been an original, a gift from his dad, back when he was still young enough to be impressed that his dad knew <i>Captain America</i>. It\u2019s probably still in a box of crated up childhood treasures somewhere at the Fifth Avenue house. He hasn\u2019t been back there since the funeral.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoward?\u201d Steve asks, breaking into Tony\u2019s thoughts. \u201cIs he-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Tony says. <i>Fractionally</i> more gently, because, okay, the guy may be gaping but he did just wake up after three quarters of a century asleep under the ice, and that does, in hindsight, entitle you to some degree of discombobulation. Thrown out of your own time and familiar surroundings like that, anyone would be at sea.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s face crumples. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>So all told, it\u2019s not a good first impression, on either side. But first impressions aren\u2019t <i>everything</i>; they can still bounce back, right?</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>Rogers continues to mope around HQ like there\u2019s nothing at all of interest to him in this brave new world. Tony visits bearing the twenty-first century version of frankincense and myrrh, namely the latest model Starkphone, not even out of beta yet, and a personally pimped out tablet that is guaranteed to pick up a wireless signal anywhere and has an auto-run program designed to hack Shield\u2019s firewalls and access anything on earth Steve might want to look at. Naturally, when Tony dumps the logs later on he finds Captain Melancholy\u2019s looked at precisely <i>nothing</i>.</p>\n<p>He stops visiting shortly after that; there\u2019s no point banging his head against a brick wall, and if Rogers is determined to live like some kind of fighting monk, complete with vows of poverty, chastity, and silence, so be it. He\u2019s got better things to do, anyway, if he\u2019s moving back to New York permanently. Pepper organises the re-fit of the penthouse at Stark Tower, turning what was essentially an executive hotel suite into something that in a dim light might approximate a home, but he flies back to Malibu to personally supervise the dismantling of his workshop and the crating up of the armours. </p>\n<p>The place is a hell of a potential security risk, even with the stripped down version of Jarvis he\u2019s leaving to monitor the house, and he guesses it\u2019s a sign of increasing maturity and personal responsibility that he breaks down the particle accelerator and sends the parts to SI Cali. The R and D guys there are already crying that he\u2019s transferred all his pet projects to Stark NY, never mind that New York was Head Office for almost fifty years, till Tony decided he preferred the sunshine and the lack of history. It\u2019s harder than he thought it would be, though, saying goodbye. He\u2019s never been nostalgic, hell, <i>out with the old, in with the new</i> is as good as a mantra to him, but he\u2019s lived on the West Coast since he graduated college, and everything about that house is <i>him</i>, writ large.</p>\n<p>He gets back to New York in time for the proto-Avengers\u2019 first outing as a team. It\u2019s nothing huge, nothing world saving, just some kind of inter-dimensional portal that opens up and disgorges a passel of robots that look like the prop designer from Doctor Who \u2013 the <i>original</i> series, no less \u2013 put them together, and, frankly, he\u2019s at a loss as to why Fury thought it would take all three of them to handle it. </p>\n<p>Natalie, or, rather, <i>Natasha</i> as she appears to go by when not impersonating an SI employee, could no doubt kill him with her pinky fingers when he\u2019s not in the suit, but that is precisely why he will never again be naked in her presence. Well. He\u2019d probably risk being <i>naked</i> in her presence\u2026 So anyway, she\u2019s a hell of a fighter, no lie, but she\u2019s still chiefly a hand to hand combatant, which isn\u2019t particularly helpful against an enemy using ranged weapons, and, oh, yeah, that can fly. </p>\n<p>The same goes for Rogers. All the time he\u2019s been putting in in the gym has clearly paid off; he\u2019s as fit and combat ready as if he\u2019d just walked off the front line, but he\u2019s seriously lacking in firepower too. The shield\u2019s a cute toy, and it\u2019s cool to see it in action \u2013 Tony\u2019d never mastered the return swing with the prototype Dad had given him, and when he\u2019d taken it apart it was equal parts curiosity and pique, if he\u2019s honest \u2013 but you\u2019d think a soldier would be a little less squeamish about heavy artillery. Rhodey certainly never says no to Tony\u2019s little presents. Or big ones, even if those don\u2019t precisely come with a gift tag.</p>\n<p>Rogers comes up with some overly-complicated plan that\u2019ll take too long to execute and clearly demonstrates the colossal failures of the 1930s high school science curriculum. Natasha sounds ready to endorse it, which doesn\u2019t say much for Russian science teaching in the 90s. Suckers, no wonder they lost the cold war. He runs the specs, overrides Jarvis\u2019 cautions, and saves the day, the girl \u2013 okay, the hotdog vendor pinned down in the cross-fire \u2013 and the city.</p>\n<p>Technically, he also destroys half a city block, but hey, Stark Industries will probably wind up paying for the damage, not Shield, and if you take into account how slowly zoning applications down here move, he probably did the neighbourhood a favour.</p>\n<p>Captain America doesn\u2019t quite see it that way. He goes berserk the second they get back to HQ, shouting about cowboys and thrill seekers and the chain of command, and the part of Tony that has long been accustomed to getting lectures from disappointed authority figures just tunes him out and enjoys the show. He is <i>stunning</i> when he\u2019s angry, there\u2019s no denying it, flushed and commanding and viscerally present and alive in a way he just hasn\u2019t been up until now, the stuff of a thousand furtive teenage fantasies made flesh. Then the part of Tony that\u2019s actually a functioning adult kicks in and reminds him he\u2019s being told off by a kid who\u2019s a decade younger than he is, relativity be damned, and doesn\u2019t know how to work an espresso machine.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called being adaptable,\u201d he shouts back when Rogers stops for breath. \u201cI thought that was a virtue in WWII.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdaptable\u2019s great,\u201d Rogers says coldly, temper back in check, \u201cbut you need to be able to signal your changes of plan to the team or you\u2019re not an asset, you\u2019re a liability.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now, Capsicle,\u201d Tony snaps back, \u201cdon\u2019t get your panties in a bunch. You\u2019re still the Star Spangled Man. They won\u2019t take that away from you, even if I am the one with the plan. The one that doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a spoiled brat,\u201d Rogers says, in a scathing tone Tony hasn\u2019t heard since he was a child, and for a moment he\u2019s back there in the nursery, listening to a run-down of all his character defects. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more to strategic planning than blowing stuff up,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou can\u2019t solve every problem with a bigger and better gun. I thought you were supposed to be out of the weapons business. Or is it just too profitable to walk away entirely?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like a red flag to a bull, the soft spot his detractors have always hit on, hard, and he reacts almost like clockwork, launching into the usual spiel, about Dad, and WWII, and being a hero. He\u2019s well aware of his own hypocrisy; that he\u2019s proud of Howard\u2019s achievements \u2013 and more than a little sorry Howard never got the chance to be proud of his \u2013 despite his overwhelming desire to distance himself from the actual man, and that he\u2019s never once hesitated to use those achievements to score easy points when tasked on his own munitions making record. It always works, on bright eyed young scientists he\u2019s trying to recruit for Stark, on journalists, on all but the most committed pacifists, and even they usually can\u2019t trump the <i>Nazis</i>.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t work on Steve Rogers, WWII veteran, who actually <i>met</i> said Nazis.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about your father,\u201d Rogers spits. \u201cYou\u2019re not <i>half</i> the man your father was. Or your uncle.\u201d </p>\n<p>And that, <i>that</i> stings, because never mind good old Dad, <i>Uncle Greg</i> spent the war in a chalet in Switzerland, wining and dining holidaying Nazi officers and exiled European royalty alike. Indeed, the fact he was good friends with the Duke of Windsor was the only thing that had kept the Starks generally off the OSS shit list; if the <i>King of England</i> couldn\u2019t control his hedonistic big brother, what chance did an up and coming young industrialist from Queens have? Gregory Stark was quite possibly the one person in the whole world Howard had respected even less than he\u2019d respected Tony. </p>\n<p>Tony himself had never met the man; he\u2019d drunk himself to death on the Riviera before Tony was even born, but he certainly <i>felt</i> like he knew him, given the number of times Howard had lectured him about being a chip off the old block. <i>Don\u2019t drink so much, don\u2019t sleep around so much, don\u2019t waste your God-given talents\u2026 You\u2019ll wind up just like Greg\u2026</i> Trust Captain America\u2019s innate goodness and Tony\u2019s accursed luck for Rogers to have somehow managed to meet the man the <i>one</i> time he was doing something that could apparently be construed as decent or heroic. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d he says at last, when he manages to get his breath back. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking dick.\u201d Witty, erudite, to the point.</p>\n<p>Rogers still gets the last word. \u201cHave the class not to speak like that in front of a woman,\u201d he says, and walks out of the room.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Natasha is standing in the corner, silent and deadly. Instead of chasing after Rogers to punch him in the back of the head for being a <i>sexist</i> dick, she just frowns at Tony, shaking her head, and heads off to Fury\u2019s office to make her report.</p>\n<p><i>Fuck</i>.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s clearly been labouring under a delusion; namely that nothing could ever be worse, in this world or any other, than the team-building and leadership exercises Pepper used to force him to take part in at SI \u2018corporate retreats\u2019. It turns out a whole new level of Hell exists, and Coulson is the gatekeeper. </p>\n<p>He appears, triumphant, one day, with a literal <i>Norse god</i> in tow. Thor is awesome, Tony really has nothing bad to say about him, except for the fact that he has nothing bad to say about him. Thor gets on with everyone. There\u2019s one curly moment where he tries to apply Asgardian chivalric norms to Natasha, but he backs off quickly when she makes her displeasure and lack of damselhood known, mumbling something about \u2018a follower of Sif\u2019. He hits her twice as hard the next time they spar, and she\u2019s won over.</p>\n<p>Rogers likes him too, which makes his dislike of Tony feel even more pointed. He tortures himself by hacking the CCTV at Shield and watching them in the gym. They\u2019re poetry in motion, all long limbed, blond perfection; muscles rippling, blue eyes twinkling, chiselled jaws that you could- </p>\n<p>Okay, enough! Apparently Rogers\u2019 dickishness isn\u2019t sufficient to douse a flame that\u2019s burned for decades; that\u2019s not Tony\u2019s fault, that\u2019s conditioning. And anyone would be gay for the God of Thunder. But he\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019ll be a third wheel in his own fantasies. Cold shower it is.</p>\n<p>It would be easier if <i>Tony</i> could dislike Thor, but he just can\u2019t. The big lug is entranced by the armour, calling it \u2018smithy worthy of the dwarves\u2019, which, Tony\u2019s read enough Tolkien to know that\u2019s a good thing. And he can <i>fly</i>. For a value of flying that involves hurling a giant hammer and somehow being dragged along behind it, and Tony would try to conjure an explanation that covers electro-magnetic fields and sigma waves, but ultimately it makes his head hurt, so magic hammer it is. It\u2019s still brilliant to have someone to share the skies with.</p>\n<p>Clint Barton, codename Hawkeye \u2013 seriously, who comes up with these things? \u2013 comes back from wherever the hell he\u2019s been, probably assassinating whoever cancelled Supernanny, and slots effortlessly back into the space that apparently has been open at Natasha\u2019s side all this time. Turns out her handle\u2019s Black Widow, and okay, that one Tony can see. They\u2019re both so taciturn and professional that it\u2019s impossible to tell whether they\u2019re having wild monkey sex while swinging from the eco-friendly light fittings once he goes home, or just really good friends. The fact he can\u2019t hack into either of their quarters leads him to suspect the former, but he\u2019s never been a good judge of other people\u2019s feelings.</p>\n<p>A judicious sifting of Eyes Only reports he has no official access to, but suspects Fury knows he reads, suggests Shield is tracking Bruce Banner in South America, and in negotiations to bring him in without rousing the Hulk. That\u2019ll really be the icing on the cake as far as he\u2019s concerned. Less for the big green guy, though it\u2019ll be nice to have someone else to do the heavy lifting, and more because he feels like his brain is atrophying. The Cali guys had their hearts broken for nothing; he never has time to get down to the labs anymore anyway.</p>\n<p>Because Coulson is the devil! Seriously. He actually has them build a tower out of office furniture, that staple of 90s power seminars, and grades them on teamwork and Marxist sounding things like \u2018contribution\u2019 rather than structural integrity \u2013 Tony\u2019s main concern \u2013 defensibility \u2013 Steve\u2019s \u2013 or ability to withstand a siege \u2013 Thor\u2019s. Natasha and Clint just stand there laughing their asses off as the big three get their failing grades. Unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Then Tony remembers he\u2019s a genius, a billionaire <i>and</i> a philanthropist, and stakes it all on one game-winning play. Thor\u2019s going stir-crazy cooped up in Shield HQ, and even Rogers <i>surely</i> would be happier if someone forced him to go out and get some fresh air, even if the sight of New New York breaks his heart every time. </p>\n<p>He makes his pitch to Coulson and Fury together; a mansion that runs an entire block of Fifth Avenue, plus whatever it takes to renovate and retrofit it for gods, monsters, super-soldiers, mad scientists and ninjas, in return for a permanent cessation to team-building exercises. Fury rorts him up to throwing in one group dinner or joint activity a fortnight, to be called team bonding instead of team building, and from the way he and Coulson grin at each other Tony feels obscurely like he\u2019s been outplayed. It\u2019s still worth it.</p>\n<p>The Avengers finally start to come together, and Tony begins to see some of the point in being a team. They do bring different skill sets to the table, and with practice they can learn to compensate for each other\u2019s weaknesses. He calls Thor when they partner up, and gets assigned Cap. It\u2019s Fury\u2019s idea, Coulson insists, to match up one meta and one mere mortal \u2013 he doesn\u2019t put it quite like that of course, but Tony\u2019s always been able to read between the lines \u2013 and to break up their natural inclinations and preferences, making them work for the relationship instead. </p>\n<p>If Clint and Natasha are annoyed at being split up and assigned to babysit a god and a monster respectively, they\u2019re far too disciplined to show it. Apparently Clint\u2019s quiet, professional demeanour is strictly a 9 to 5 thing, and he shrugs it off with the uniform, turning into a frat-boy as soon as he gets home. Thor takes to his sense of humour with gusto, and they bond over a shared love of junk food and reality television. Thor thinks the contestants \u2018petty and tiny\u2019, but hey, there\u2019s no denying that. Even Bruce, when he arrives, seems to find Natasha\u2019s quiet calm soothing, and he slowly starts spending more time in the common areas than alone in the lab Tony custom designed for him.</p>\n<p>Cap looks like he\u2019s biting into a lemon when the partnership is announced, but he shakes Tony\u2019s hand and promises to do his best, so the least Tony can do is make an effort. Surprisingly, it does work. Steve\u2019s tactical eye is superb, and once Tony masters the dated military jargon he can lay out a plan with all due speed. He also takes Tony\u2019s input and runs with it, adapting on the fly and utilising everyone\u2019s best strengths and abilities. </p>\n<p>Tony does air recon, and between them they can visualise the entire field of battle, and Jarvis can relay their conclusions to the rest of the team in no time. They reach a point where they can fight like a seamless unit, and they both accept that they make each other better heroes. On the street, in the air, they\u2019re inseparable. Off-duty there\u2019s still a strain, but they\u2019ve at least stopped <i>deliberately</i> pressing on each other\u2019s bruises.</p>\n<p>Accidentally is another matter.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s picked up by now that it\u2019s not on purpose, maybe not even conscious, but Steve has this way of <i>looking</i> at him that is the most dissonant thing he\u2019s ever experienced. Continued observation confirms that his first impression <i>wasn\u2019t</i> mistaken; Tony Stark has cruised and been cruised by too many guys not to recognise good old fashioned attraction when he sees it. It\u2019s overlaid by too many other emotions to fully parse though; sadness, anger, disappointment, and a far-away look that can only be reminiscence.</p>\n<p>Best case scenario, Man of the Year 1942 is having some kind of existential crisis about being sexually attracted to another man. Tony\u2019s not stupid, he knows it must be hard to adjust to the constant barrage of changed social norms and cultural attitudes Steve\u2019s facing, and if it\u2019s a new realisation, hell, it\u2019s one people still struggle with today.</p>\n<p>Worst case scenario\u2026 Steve had some kind of man-crush on Howard, and when he looks at Tony he\u2019s actually thinking about him. That is so many levels of bad and wrong that Tony actually can\u2019t bear it, so he puts it out of his mind, and uses the Power of Positive Thinking to make himself forget he ever considered it.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re having a rare \u2013 but getting less rare \u2013 moment of quiet amity, sitting in the kitchen while Steve eats a midnight snack of scrambled eggs \u2013 price of his hyper-metabolism \u2013 and Tony\u2019s mentally walking through ways to make the armour easier to hang on to, without making it <i>easier for villains to hang on to</i>. A couple of times now he\u2019s had to carry Steve out of the field of battle, and Clint\u2019s been very quick to jump all over the fact they look like Superman and Lois Lane. Unacceptable.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s taken by surprise, then, when Steve suddenly asks after Howard and Greg, what happened to them, and if Tony tries to rein in his customary sarcasm and defensiveness, he clearly isn\u2019t successful. Steve is equal parts angry and disgusted and hurt, and possibly even <i>disappointed</i>, which is by far the worst for reasons Tony doesn\u2019t want to examine too closely. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really that selfish, that ungrateful?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cYou\u2019re their only surviving family, and that\u2019s how you talk about them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to keep their secrets? Keep a stiff upper lip and cover for them and tell you they were just swell? They <i>weren\u2019t</i>. Greg was a full on alcoholic and an asshole, and he died alone without a friend in the world once he\u2019d burned through his share of the family fortune. Howard wasn\u2019t much better by the end, though he was high-functioning, I\u2019ll give you that, it <i>never</i> interfered with his work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone who\u2019s so angry about it,\u201d Steve observes poisonously, \u201cyou sure drink a lot yourself. Is that a glass, or a bucket?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glances down at the tumbler he\u2019s just refilled. They <i>are</i> big, to be sure, maybe pushing a pint, but he didn\u2019t choose them; the interior designer picked them out when she stocked the bar, more for the aesthetic than any sense of practicality, big square things, heavy crystal with titanium features. It\u2019s possible you\u2019re not supposed to <i>fill</i> them, but that is not a line of enquiry he wants to head down right now, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>The best defence has always been a good offence, so he goes on the attack. \u201cOh, and you\u2019d know so much about it, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he snaps, \u201cMr I Metabolise Alcohol in Minutes, and Was Probably Too Much of a Buzz Kill to Cut Loose Even Before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve looks at him with more scorn than he\u2019s seen in one gaze since he was expelled from his second boarding school and Howard had to take time off work, and write a cheque to build an Olympic-sized swimming pool, to get him into a third.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy father was a drunk,\u201d he says coldly, \u201c<i>and</i> a bully. He used to beat my mother right in front of me, and there was never anything I could do to stop him. But by all means, carry on complaining about how your father was <i>too busy</i> to spend time with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shoves back his stool and leaves, half-finished plate abandoned, not even bothering to slam the door.</p>\n<p>Well, <i>fuck</i>. That wasn\u2019t in any of the files. Tony puts the glass down, and makes a mental note to order some regular sized tumblers.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no two ways about it, he was in the wrong this time. As an olive branch, Tony decides to refurbish the library. Everyone needs a space to call their own, and everyone but Steve has staked one out by now. Tony has his workshop, Bruce loves his lab, Thor and Clint have colonised the home theatre. Natasha has claimed the conservatory, filling it with the kind of beautiful trinkets Tony would have assumed six months ago she wouldn\u2019t care for. Steve hasn\u2019t asked for anything.</p>\n<p>Tony hasn\u2019t set foot in the library since he moved back to New York, but he does have fond memories of it as a kid; Howard was always in a good mood when he was in there, reading for pleasure instead of work, smoking and having a quiet drink. He\u2019d even let Tony sit on the ottoman at his feet and chatter about his day. Tony hasn\u2019t picked up an artefact book in years, but Steve and the e-book\u2019s mutual antipathy is well established, so he orders paper copies of everything that\u2019s made the NYT bestsellers list in the last seventy years, and adds them to the first editions and classics that Howard and Maria had collected.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s obviously touched, and his face goes all soft and sad when he thanks Tony. The best reward, apart from the fact that they\u2019re speaking again, is that he actually <i>uses</i> the space. He doesn\u2019t seem to sleep much, which Tony can certainly empathise with, and when Tony comes upstairs after a late night in the shop he\u2019s often still sitting there, books and magazines and newspapers spread out on the table in front of him, forgotten cup of cocoa at his elbow. </p>\n<p>Tony pops his head in, now and then, and is pleased to get a friendly response. Sometimes they even chat, briefly, and after a while he starts stopping for a quiet drink before bed. Cocoa, not scotch. It\u2019s weird, but he kind of likes it. He may not be the bigger man, but he is older \u2013 well, <i>sort of</i> \u2013 and maybe a little wiser, at least in some ways. He\u2019s certainly seen more of the world, for all Steve fought a war to save that world.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t stop looking for you, you know,\u201d Tony says one night. It seems only fair. Steve is alone, and adrift, and everyone he ever knew or loved is dead and gone. If he\u2019d cared about Howard, and talking about him will make him happy, then Tony can suck it up. \u201cHe used to take a team out every year, to look himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Steve\u2019s whole face softens, and as the hard edges fade he\u2019s even more gorgeous.</p>\n<p>\u201cI went with him once,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI guess I\u2019d gotten a good report that semester or something, and he wanted to encourage me in my brief delusion that oceanography was where it was at.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve smiles ruefully. \u201cBefore you discovered robots?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d already discovered robots,\u201d Tony laughs, \u201cI built my first robot when I was eight. But that year I discovered <i>girls</i>. I was desperate to get into Penny York\u2019s pants, and she wanted to be a marine biologist.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s blush travels all the way down his neck and under his collar. It\u2019s adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he died in a <i>car wreck</i>,\u201d he says suddenly. \u201cI mean, he flew in and out of Nazi-occupied Europe solo, he blew up his own lab at SSR so many times the MPs stopped reacting, I just assumed he\u2019d either crash a rocket ship on the way to Mars, or that he\u2019d live forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Tony says, surprising himself with his own honesty. \u201cI really thought the cop they sent to tell me the news was joking, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d Steve asks softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d Tony wishes he\u2019d had the scotch tonight, if they\u2019re having this conversation. \u201cI was still in Cambridge. Everyone thought he\u2019d come to arrest me when he walked into the lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve ignores the re-direct and zeroes in on the heart of the problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was no other family at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, my mom\u2019s parents died when I was a kid; my dad\u2019s were long gone before he ever remembered he was supposed to do something mundane like get married. There was Uncle Greg, obviously, but he was already gone, and Mom\u2019s brother Antonio, who I was named for, who died in the war. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t ever think about getting married, having a family of your own?\u201d Steve asks, with that unerring instinct of his for the pertinent question.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought about it exactly <i>once</i>, when he and Pepper were at the height of their honeymoon phase, before she\u2019d decided she could just about manage to sit at his bedside or wait for the inevitable call as his assistant, but not as his partner. Even then, it hadn\u2019t really loomed large as a life goal.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot of things, Cap,\u201d he says at last, \u201cnot all of them good, but I like to think I\u2019m at least not a hypocrite. I wouldn\u2019t be any better at it than Dad was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve just nods, not exactly like he agrees, but for once not offended either.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he says, shaking it off, \u201che was almost eighty. He\u2019d had a damn good life, by anyone\u2019s measure, even a Stark\u2019s. My mom was barely fifty.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the time he hadn\u2019t really processed that, beyond the fact that she was <i>gone</i>, and she\u2019d never again smooth his hair back when he was sick, or kiss him on the temple as she rushed out to lunch or a meeting, leaving a brilliant scarlet smear of lipstick on his skin, and a trace of heavy perfume on his clothes. Now that forty\u2019s in the rear view mirror and he\u2019s looking down the road to fifty himself, it seems catastrophically unfair.</p>\n<p>He realises Steve\u2019s looking at him, clearly waiting for him to answer, and shakes himself. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said tell me about her,\u201d Steve repeats.</p>\n<p>Tony stares at him for an awkward minute. No one\u2019s ever asked him about Maria; no one\u2019s ever cared. It\u2019s like he sprang fully armoured from his father\u2019s head, and wow, that metaphor\u2019s more apt than he really cares to think about. </p>\n<p>He gets up and pours himself that drink, mostly soda though Steve makes a point of not watching, eyes firmly on his own hands, and takes a seat opposite him at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell,\u201d he starts, and maybe he is a hypocrite after all, because he <i>doesn\u2019t</i> really have much to say, beyond the fact that she was smart, and she was beautiful, and she was <i>his</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cDad met her parents in Italy during the war, I guess one of those times he was flying around, being Howard Stark, doing something he shouldn\u2019t have been? Anyway, they hit it off, Dad and my grandparents, and he sponsored them to come to America after the war, to New York. I think they had a bakery in Queens. Something clich\u00e9d like that. And it must have occurred to him one day that he\u2019d forgotten to get married when everyone else was doing it, and here he was, a multi-millionaire with a dozen factories and half of New York to his name, and no one to leave his ill-gotten gains to.\u201d</p>\n<p>That isn\u2019t entirely fair; Howard had already set up a bunch of scholarships for returned GIs by that point, and together he and Maria would go on to do a lot more.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo anyway, he remembered those old friends of his, and lucky for him my mom was pretty firmly on the shelf, thirty and unmarried, what a scandal, so it was win-win. And then they had me, and that was it, I guess.\u201d He smirks self deprecatingly. Steve just looks sadder than ever, and wow, that\u2019s somehow worse than when he looks annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so cynical,\u201d Steve says. \u201cThat could be a really romantic story if you told it just a little differently, instead of assuming the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d Tony snaps, stung. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Steve shrugs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you really do either, not for sure. We never know that about other people, who they loved, and what they lost, and the things that broke their hearts. Why not put a positive spin on things; wouldn\u2019t it make you happier? Maybe he really loved her. Maybe he was just waiting for the right person all those years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Tony sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s true,\u201d Steve says, with a passion he hasn\u2019t shown previously. \u201cI hope they were happy together. All my friends are dead. Some of them lived to grow old, but a lot of them didn\u2019t. My best friend died right in front of me; he was only twenty-nine. I never got to see him settle down, get married. I never got to be his best man, or play with his kids, or any of those things. I never got to do any of those things myself. It\u2019s nice to know at least one person I care about got to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, come on,\u201d Tony says, fighting a sudden pang of guilt mixed with genuine sympathy, and maybe something else. \u201cYou\u2019re still only twenty-nine. You\u2019ll get another chance. You can have it all, whatever you want, big wedding, white picket fence, you name it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Steve echoes. \u201cBut it\u2019s harder the second time round, you know? When you\u2019ve already met the person you wanted to spend the rest of your life with, when you\u2019ve already had those conversations and made those plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Tony says, mortified. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs. \u201cIt was stupid making those kinds of plans in wartime. I don\u2019t know what we were thinking. It probably wouldn\u2019t have worked out anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it would have!\u201d Tony insists, unsure even as he says it if he\u2019s making things better or worse. Steve is starting to look glassy eyed and pinched around the mouth, and that\u2019s nothing he ever wanted to see. \u201cYou\u2019re Captain America!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve snorts, and that at least breaks the worst of the tension.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026 You\u2019re <i>you</i>. Steve Rogers. What could possibly go wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApart from crashing in the Arctic and being frozen for seventy years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, apart from that. I mean, no one\u2019s perfect. But that\u2019s hardly up there with forgetting to put the toilet seat down. Or buying strawberries for someone who\u2019s allergic. Trust me. Hey! We should look them up. Maybe they\u2019re still out there. We could go visit; I\u2019ll drive you wherever you want to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you,\u201d Steve says, smiling weakly, \u201cbut they\u2019ve been dead a really long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And this is why Tony should think before he speaks. Damn it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says again, astonished by how much he means it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what the worst thing is?\u201d Steve asks.</p>\n<p>Tony shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s that it\u2019s not enough that I have to find out that they\u2019re dead and somehow carry on. I could manage that. It\u2019s that I know that <i>they</i> had to find out <i>I</i> was dead, and that they didn\u2019t carry on. Not as well as they should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing Tony can say to that, so he just nods and pours Steve a drink. Even if he can\u2019t get drunk, it might give him a momentary lift.</p>\n<p>Steve takes the drink and raises it in a toast. \u201cI know you guys didn\u2019t get on so great,\u201d he says, changing the subject decisively, \u201cbut you really do remind me of your dad. I guess the war changed him, but he was a great guy when I knew him. He was very charming. Witty, confident, and so, so smart. A lot of fun to be around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony coughs, torn between habitual irritation at being compared to his father, and a vague sense of confused glee that <i>Captain America</i> thinks he\u2019s charming and fun to be around. When did <i>that</i> happen?</p>\n<p>Steve laughs, genuine and sweet. \u201cWe rubbed each other up the wrong way too, when we first met. I thought he was over-bearing and full of himself. The loudest voice in the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huh. That\u2019s less endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I thought he was making a play for my girl. Well. The girl I was sweet on, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony demands; this is a new one on him. Howard had barely had time for his wife and son; he certainly hadn\u2019t talked about any great war-time romances.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Turns out fondue didn\u2019t mean what I thought it meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony bursts out laughing at that, visions of his mother\u2019s \u201cchic\u201d seventies soir\u00e9es in his head, heavy bangles clinking on her arms as she\u2019d hauled him up into her lap and let him commandeer her fork for a moment or two before sending him back to bed. \u201cWhat on earth did you think it meant?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve blushes again. It\u2019s every bit as adorable as before. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was just a kid from Brooklyn; all I knew was that the French were the masters when it came to that sort of thing. When your dad suggested dropping everything and heading to Lucerne for the night I assumed the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucerne?\u201d Tony asks, curious. \u201cIs that where you met Greg?\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile falls off Steve\u2019s face. \u201cWhat? No. He was in... I met him at HQ in London. He was working on one of Howard\u2019s projects at SSR. I know you never met him, but Howard really never said anything about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot anything good,\u201d Tony says, feeling like he\u2019s on shaky ground, for no reason he can fathom. \u201cI guess they must have fallen out after the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve says, his voice small, and <i>oh my god</i>, Tony thinks, <i>are his eyes welling up?</i></p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey, no,\u201d he stammers, trying to head that one off at the pass. There\u2019s a special circle in Hell reserved for the man who makes Captain America cry, and it\u2019s got to be below Coulson\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t as bad as all that. Maybe I misunderstood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he died alone in a French chateau with only the servants for company, before you were born, right?\u201d Steve asks bitterly. \u201cI didn\u2019t misunderstand that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, but Tony can be a prick sometimes. He bitterly regrets having said that to someone who\u2019d considered the man a friend, but there\u2019s no way now to take it back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, surprised by how much he means it.</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cyou look a lot like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve says. \u201cYour uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony\u2019s surprised. There hadn\u2019t been a lot of pictures of Greg around the house when he was growing up, a few portraits of him and Howard when they were kids, a couple of old fashioned glamour shots turned into postcards from the ski fields or the beach when he was living the life of Riley in the 50s and 60s. There\u2019d been a family resemblance, sure, all the Stark men look a lot alike, but nothing uncanny.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says. \u201cThat\u2019s what threw me the first day I met you. Seeing you standing there. I reacted badly, but it wasn\u2019t anything personal, anything you\u2019d done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony says. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve goes to bed not long after, still looking wrecked, and Tony goes back down to the workshop, pretty shaken himself.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird, the way a thing like friendship can creep up on you. Tony\u2019s never been particularly <i>good</i> at it; accelerated too fast at school and always out of his peer group, perpetually too young to be included in the activities organised by his academic cohort, but far too smart, and, if he\u2019s honest, arrogant to be welcomed back by the boys his own age. Like oldest and only children throughout the ages, he\u2019d spent a lot of time with adults, precocious and charming and popular, at least until he started making <i>them</i> feel uncomfortable with questions they couldn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>His college years are a blur of sex, drugs and rock and roll, liberally soaked in alcohol, and it\u2019s pretty telling he\u2019s kept in touch with precisely <i>one</i> person he knew back then. God only knows what induced Rhodey to stick around, but it was more than likely his own incredible sense of loyalty and honour, not anything Tony did to deserve it. Pepper, too, presumably liked her job long before she liked him. He knows he\u2019s doing them both a disservice, and would never question their generosity and kindness, but in low moments he\u2019s always assumed they wouldn\u2019t have had time to grow to care about him if he hadn\u2019t been paying them a salary first.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s truly a surprise, then, to realise, on a perfectly ordinary day, that he and Steve Rogers are, by all accepted definitions of the word, <i>friends</i>. It\u2019s even more of a surprise to realise that he\u2019s happy; that he doesn\u2019t miss Malibu at all, that he loves New York, and he loves the mansion, and he loves the Avengers, and he loves-</p>\n<p>Well.</p>\n<p>So they\u2019re friends and partners. They are <i>hell on wheels</i> in combat; the message spreads pretty far, pretty fast, that you do <i>not</i> want to mess with any of the Avengers, but it doesn\u2019t go unobserved that nothing gets repulsors turned to maximum faster than bruises on Captain America, and likewise any announcement from Jarvis of failing systems leads to particularly vicious application of vibranium to faces. They find the perfect way to get from place to place, and if Clint baptises it the \u2018hug and fly\u2019 it\u2019s not a barb that hits the mark. The fact that there\u2019s a hollow the exact depth and width of Captain America\u2019s fingers in the right shoulder of the armour, and the boots are now fractionally wider and flatter, is a secret known only to the two of them, and to Jarvis.</p>\n<p>The day AIM actually comes up with an advanced idea, and manages to force the arc reactor to cycle twice as fast is a lesson to Tony in not taking other people\u2019s incompetence in matters mechanical for granted. His heart is beating so fast it feels like his chest is going to explode, completely different from the standard drag and creeping cold, and he barely has time to dump an astonished Steve on a roof-top, unable to speak to explain, before overloaded systems start shorting out. Jarvis sends an automatic distress call to get Thor to pick Steve up, and transfers all power to the repulsors. It\u2019s all Tony can do to stay pointed in the right direction. </p>\n<p>Crashing onto the landing pad at the mansion, he hits the emergency release and tears the chest plate off, leaving it where it falls and staggering, hampered by the dead weight of the armour, into the workshop. He can barely get the gauntlets and the helmet off, and his fingers fumble at the reactor locking mechanism; Christ, he never thought <i>he\u2019d</i> be the one trying to forcibly wrench it out. It comes loose at last, and the relief is massive as he manages to drag in a decent breath. </p>\n<p>The old familiar pins and needles kick in as he\u2019s rushing through the security countermeasures to get to the back-up reactor. It feels worse than ever on his already overtaxed system, nausea from the adrenaline bleed-off swamping him, and he\u2019s seriously contemplating the indignity of being found collapsed in a pool of his own vomit when he manages to dock the reactor and feels the hum as it kicks back in. The blue light is just a pleasant glow at the edge of the swallowing darkness as he slides to the floor behind the workbench.</p>\n<p>He stirs to the sound of shattering reinforced glass, and the unmistakeable clang of Captain America\u2019s shield hitting the concrete floor. Steve\u2019s hands are roaming fierce and frantic all over him, pulling off the last remaining pieces of the armour, and then his fingers skirt the reactor, press at the pulse in his neck, finally find what they\u2019re looking for, and even with his eyes closed Tony can feel him slump in exhausted relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he manages to croak.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my <i>God</i>, Tony,\u201d Steve says, and he sounds truly desperate.</p>\n<p>Tony forces his gritty eyes open. Steve\u2019s got the cowl down, and his face is bone white, every trace of colour gone. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says quickly, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve opens his mouth to say something, then thinks better of it, pulling Tony roughly into a sitting position, and okay, that kind of hurts, and then throwing both arms around him, hugging him harder than he\u2019s ever been hugged before. That kind of hurts too, to be honest, but it is totally, totally worth it, and Tony manages to snake his arms around Steve\u2019s waist and hug back, burying his face in the gap between his jaw and the collar of his uniform. The smell of Imperial Leather and sweat and Kevlar is the best thing ever.</p>\n<p>Rapidly downgraded to second best when Steve\u2019s hand slides off his shoulder and up his neck to cradle the back of his head and gently pull him up so he can see his face. It takes all of three seconds for his eyes to shift from questioning to decided, and then he\u2019s pressing his lips to Tony\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Tony opens his mouth immediately; he\u2019d have to be all the way dead, not half, not to respond when he gets what he\u2019s always wanted. His poor confused heart doesn\u2019t know how to react, still going a mile a minute, but other parts of him do, and he shifts to his knees to get closer to Steve. Steve pulls him up onto his lap, hand dropping to his lower back to support him, and kisses him harder, his own mouth opening without hesitation, welcoming Tony's tongue, caressing it with his own. </p>\n<p>Tony bites Steve's full lower lip like he's dreamed of doing for so long, then the point of his chin, then along his jaw and all the way back, kissing and licking every inch. He works a hand inside Steve's collar, desperate for the feel of more skin, and Steve's right there with him, not shy at all, pulling back and yanking at the fastenings on his battle-jacket, laughing when Tony whines at the loss of contact. He's not much better though, grabbing Tony's undershirt in both hands and ripping it open, off his shoulders, big hands stroking and squeezing and touching Tony all over.</p>\n<p>Tony shoves him, hard, and Steve's not expecting it, falling back onto the floor, a look of surprise flicking over his face, rapidly replaced by satisfaction as Tony slides up to straddle his waist and leans over him to kiss him some more. They kiss for what feels like forever, then Tony shifts back, practised hands working at the buckles on Steve\u2019s utility belt, snapping open the hidden fastenings on his uniform pants.</p>\n<p>\"Tony, wait,\" Steve groans, even as he raises his hips to help. </p>\n<p>Tony doesn't grace that with an answer, just tears down Steve's pants and boxers, pulling them over his thighs and down to his knees. He doesn\u2019t waste time on fancy tricks or teasing, doesn\u2019t have the energy for it, just breathes deep and lurches in, swallowing Steve in one movement. He gags for a second as Steve's cock hits the back of his throat, then he finds the right angle and relaxes. Steve\u2019s arching his back, head rolling on the floor, hands resolutely clenched at his sides.</p>\n<p>Tony grabs them both and places them firmly on his own shoulders. Steve takes him at his implied word, one folding gently around his shoulder blade, the fingers of the other trailing across his neck tentatively, then curving around, not pushing, not forcing, just holding him there. Tony sucks harder, head rising and falling, pulling off enough to wrap his hand around the base and stroke firmly as he tongues the head, trailing the fingers of his free hand across Steve's thigh. The muscles are so tense they're like steel. Tony looks up quickly; it'll kill him if Steve's not enjoying this, but he'd rather die than have him <i>pretend</i>.</p>\n<p>Steve's wild-eyed and breathless, biting his lip to keep from crying out, but when he meets Tony's gaze he relaxes, breathing out, allowing himself to gasp, and sigh, and smile the sweetest smile Tony has ever seen. Like the gentleman he is he pushes at Tony\u2019s shoulder when he\u2019s at the brink, and like the wanton <i>he</i> is Tony just forces his head down further and swallows everything. He keeps sucking till Steve shudders and pushes him harder, at which he pulls off with a final kiss to Steve\u2019s softening cock. Steve doesn\u2019t let go of him, pulling him back down, and he goes, exhausted, resting his cheek on Steve\u2019s still heaving stomach.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still hard as anything, but strangely he\u2019s happy just to lie there as Steve\u2019s breathing slows, stroking his thumb back and forth across Steve\u2019s exposed hipbone. Until Steve sits up suddenly, seizing Tony by the biceps and holding him at arm\u2019s length, staring hard at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d he says, and he sounds horrified, not impressed. \u201cTony, what-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, skipping panic and despair and already halfway to angry. \u201cDo <i>not</i>. Do not say anything, do not think anything. Just answer me this. Are you coming upstairs with me, or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>can\u2019t</i>,\u201d Steve says, hands running frantically down Tony\u2019s arms then shifting up so that his fingers skim along his temple and jawline. \u201cOh, my God, what have I done?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Tony insists. \u201cI fought Ironmonger in worse shape than this, I promise I\u2019m fine. But you\u2019re looking at me kind of weird and it\u2019s freaking me out. Please, <i>please</i> tell me you\u2019re not regretting it already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve demands. \u201cWhat? No. No, of course not, it\u2019s not that, I just-\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony cuts him off with another hard kiss. Steve kisses back, then rubs his thumbs, hard, in the hollows under Tony\u2019s ears, right at the back of his jaw, just where Tony likes it. He shivers uncontrollably, and Steve laughs, and says, \u201cYeah. Yeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stumble to their feet, Steve hitching his pants up enough to be able to walk, Tony attempting to right his torn shirt and giving it up as a lost cause. He wonders if they can make it up to his bedroom without running into the others, and Steve, reading his mind, says, \u201cThey\u2019re at HQ, I promised I\u2019d-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJarvis,\u201d Tony barks, cutting him off. \u201cSend the <i>All Clear</i> to all Avengers. Tell them I\u2019m fine, and not to hurry back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Jarvis says demurely, and Steve bursts out laughing. They stagger up the stairs arm in arm, and it takes three times as long as usual for the number of times they stop along the way.</p>\n<p>They do eventually reach Tony\u2019s bedroom, and as he opens the door he experiences a moment of nervousness like he hasn\u2019t felt in years. Steve appears to have hijacked his missing confidence, however, grabbing him around the waist with both hands and dragging him inside, kicking the door shut behind him. He manhandles Tony across the room, which okay, yes, is definitely a turn on, and deposits him on the bed.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not <i>quite</i> how Tony had imagined it going \u2013 as a teenager he\u2019d always cast Cap as the experienced one, of course, but as he\u2019d gotten older, and especially once he\u2019d <i>met</i> him in all his uptight glory, he\u2019d regrouped and recast himself as the seducer \u2013 but that\u2019s about all the time he has to ponder it, because Steve is stripping off his uniform with military speed and precision, raised eyebrow making clear what he thinks of Tony\u2019s malingering.</p>\n<p>Tony laughs and unbuckles his own pants, easing them down over his aching cock, which is very glad indeed to finally be involved in the proceedings. Steve is like a finely sculpted work of art, fully hard again already, cock flushed pink and standing in a proud curve against his perfectly flat stomach. Tony takes a moment to appreciate the view, then spreads his legs in open invitation.</p>\n<p>Steve grins and climbs up onto the bed, carefully settling his weight over him. Tony isn\u2019t exactly <i>small</i>, but the size difference has never been more obvious, and he feels smothered and protected all at once. He just lies there for a moment, revelling in it, letting Steve rock against him gently, then stretches out an arm to rummage in the bedside table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you know what to do with this, soldier?\u201d he says archly, slapping the tube against Steve\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Steve punches him in the arm, and says, \u201cYes; don\u2019t be horrible. Next thing I know you\u2019ll be calling me <i>fast</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Tony says, overjoyed that they\u2019ve reached a place where they can joke around like this, \u201cI\u2019m the one that\u2019s fast.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve slicks his fingers quickly, then lightly circles Tony\u2019s hole. Tony spreads his legs further. Steve's first finger slides in easily, and he wastes no time in following with two together, making Tony gasp. It\u2019s obvious he does know what he\u2019s doing, scissoring his fingers to stretch the muscle, then withdrawing to add more lube. </p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Steve, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Tony moans. \u201cI\u2019m ready, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve leans forward, kissing Tony messily, reaching down with one hand to line himself up, even as the other strokes Tony\u2019s jaw. The head of his cock slips in easily, and he waits a moment for Tony to adjust around him, then pushes in the rest of the way in one smooth movement. Tony moans out Steve\u2019s name and clenches, hard, and Steve cries out above him and starts thrusting, deep, slow, steady thrusts that Tony pushes back into, gripping Steve\u2019s hips, hard, with his thighs, and using both hands to pull Steve's head down. He bites savagely at Steve's lips, sucks on his tongue, pants hot and wet against his cheek. </p>\n<p>Steve angles himself perfectly, head of his cock gliding over Tony\u2019s prostate with every thrust, then he turns his head and whispers hoarsely, \u201cI love you,\u201d right into Tony\u2019s ear. Tony comes spectacularly, untouched, whole body jerking uncontrollably in Steve's arms, ass clenching around his cock, milking him. Steve manages another couple of strokes, then he\u2019s coming too, crying out into Tony\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s fascinated by the arc reactor. Every time they sprawl out in bed together, afterglow metaphorical and literal, he spends long minutes running his fingers over and around it, tracing the seams and lines of it, gliding round the edges and making Tony shiver. No one but Pepper\u2019s ever touched it before \u2013 the few casual flings he\u2019s had since they split up he\u2019s made a point of keeping at least an undershirt on \u2013 and even she\u2019d preferred not to dwell on it. Steve seems to love it though. </p>\n<p>Once, just once, he puts his hand over it to block the light while he\u2019s sitting astride Tony\u2019s hips on the couch in the upstairs lounge, his other hand locked in Tony\u2019s hair, pulling his head back, and Tony freaks out and shoves him off onto the floor with all his panic-fuelled strength. Steve isn\u2019t offended; he just sits quietly at Tony\u2019s feet until he calms, and then sits some more, saying nothing, while Tony tells him about Obadiah, and what it felt like to have a man he\u2019d thought of as a father, a better father in many ways than Howard had ever been, rip his heart right out of his chest. </p>\n<p>Steve makes no comment, just offers up stories of his own in return. He blushes when he talks about Peggy, how beautiful she was; cool and calm and collected, unflappable, the very image of grace under fire. Tony\u2019d met her once, when he was very young; she\u2019d been visiting the US on a joint training exercise, well into her career at what had become MI6 by then, still a beauty at sixty. He\u2019s a lot more cautious, careful to be gentle, when he tells Steve she\u2019d gotten married to an RAF pilot and had three children of her own. </p>\n<p>Steve takes it better than he\u2019d assumed, just smiling that sweet, enigmatic smile of his as though it was a personal victory to chalk up another happy ending for a friend. He still gets sad when he talks about Bucky, but it\u2019s maybe a good kind of sad, like it\u2019s starting to be good to remember again. He doesn\u2019t talk about Greg, though he still reminisces about Howard from time to time. Tony doesn\u2019t really think anything of it.</p>\n<p>They start spending all their time together, to the great and visible amusement of the rest of the team. Thor asks Tony his intentions, which makes him bristle until he tells Steve, in high dudgeon, only to have Steve laugh and confide that Bruce had asked him the same, vowing to send the Hulk round if required. It\u2019s so silly and clich\u00e9d, for all its operatic sturm und drang, that they both crack up laughing, unable to take offence. </p>\n<p>They trade off quiet nights in the library for time spent in the shop, Tony fiddling with upgrades to the armour, or advanced Stark projects he now occasionally has the time for again, though the all-encompassing passion is a thing of the past. Steve tinkers with Howard\u2019s car collection, still in the garage, most of which are as old as he is, <i>really</i> is, rejecting out of hand Tony\u2019s offer to have some actual masterpieces of automotive engineering shipped out from Malibu. It\u2019s something perilously close to perfect, and Tony is gloriously, deliriously happy. He really should know by now that means it won\u2019t last.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Thor who picks the bauble up, in the wake of another easily defeated extra-dimensional invasion, saying it reminds him of home. Not Asgardian, exactly, but \u2018of the Realms\u2019 as he puts it. It\u2019s Tony\u2019s own damn fault, though, for not realising that the fact that Thor could touch it with impunity meant less than nothing for the unfortunate denizens of Midgard.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s mid-sentence on the need to clear alien contraband, rather than bring it home, as his fingertips graze the edge of the sphere and it lights up with a burst of brilliant white that sears the eye and makes what feels like every synapse in his head fire at once.</p>\n<p>He comes to on the foyer floor, with a splitting headache. Rolling onto his back and staring bleary-eyed at the ceiling, he\u2019s relieved to discover that he\u2019s not, in fact, blind, and the lights are just out. He claps his hands and calls for Jarvis. There\u2019s no response. He\u2019s also, he realises, alone, no sign of Thor or any of the others.</p>\n<p>Clambering to his feet and tripping over some random piece of furniture that he\u2019s pretty sure isn\u2019t where it should be, he runs a hand along the wall, looking for a light switch. When he finds it at last and flips it \u2013 <i>flips</i> it; what happened to his touch panels? \u2013 his poor, suffering eyes are immediately assaulted by a ghastly red and black flock wallpaper in place of his tasteful ecru walls.</p>\n<p>He stumbles up the staircase, which is at least where it should it be, even if it\u2019s covered in an Axminster that matches \u2013 just barely \u2013 the walls. The upstairs rooms are even more of a nightmare, though he\u2019s starting to recognise the odd piece of furniture that was in the house when he was a kid. It\u2019s a good thing the arc reactor\u2019s been recently overhauled, because he\u2019s on the verge of a heart attack. Running back downstairs he skirts the foyer and heads down the back staircase \u2013 the one he had removed when he renovated \u2013 to what should be his workshop.</p>\n<p>He finds instead, as feared, the locked fire door that often greeted him as a child when he escaped the nanny and went in search of his father. The good thing about being an adult, albeit one clearly in the wrong dimension, is that locked doors no longer represent an insurmountable obstacle. It\u2019s the work of a few short minutes to pick the lock, using only the contents of his pockets. Any sense of self-congratulation dissipates, however, when he\u2019s confronted with a laboratory and computer bank that would make an elementary school in a one-horse town cry.</p>\n<p>Those fucking aliens weren\u2019t just dimension-hoppers, they were <i>time-travellers</i>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s breathing deep and ordering himself not to panic when there\u2019s an unmistakeable click behind him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHands in the air, pal,\u201d a voice that skirts the edges of familiar orders. \u201cAnd turn around. Slowly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deciding he\u2019d rather be shot in the front than the back, Tony does. And promptly wishes he hadn\u2019t bothered. Glaring at him over the barrel of a cocked revolver, in an impeccable double-breasted suit, is Howard Stark. A Howard Stark who can\u2019t be a day over thirty, if he\u2019s even that.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreg?\u201d he asks, gun wavering.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony says, thrown. \u201cNo. Yes. Yes!\u201d</p>\n<p>The gun snaps back up. \u201cNice try, Fritz,\u201d Howard snaps. \u201cYou almost had me. But next time, wear a thicker shirt. Your jet-pack\u2019s showing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glances down at his chest, where, sure enough, the damning blue glow of the reactor is shining through his sweater. Well. No one ever said Howard Stark was stupid.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Tony Stark isn\u2019t either. He puts the fact he\u2019s talking to his father, who is currently younger than he is, firmly out of his conscious mind, and rapidly processes and discards a dozen excuses and explanations that <i>might</i> not end in Howard calling OSS, and him being carted off to prison as a Nazi spy. Water-boarding <i>probably</i> hasn\u2019t been invented yet, but he\u2019s in no rush to find out what the method du jour is.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no two ways about it, unfortunately. If he\u2019s to have any hope of getting home, he\u2019s going to need Howard\u2019s help. And that means telling the truth. Or a version of it. There\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s admitting just who he is and risking some kind of touching reunion. Fortunately, Howard has given him the perfect in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Tony Stark,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m your nephew from the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Howard stops laughing, he tries again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously. I know it seems far-fetched, but if you\u2019ll let me reach into my pocket I can show you my ID.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard laughs some more, then nods his head. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d he says. \u201cI could use a good laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony knows better than to bother with his driver\u2019s licence; instead he pulls out his all-access Stark Industries master-key and his Avengers ID, both of which contain enough micro-circuitry, holographic chips, and gold-titanium ribbon to impress.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can also show you my phone,\u201d he says. \u201cEven Starkware won\u2019t have service here, but the data storage is huge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard doesn\u2019t put the gun away, but he stops pointing it at Tony, ushering him over to the desk and telling him to sit down. He pulls out a small torch, and starts waving it at Tony\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tony asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking for plastic surgery scars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony just can\u2019t help himself. \u201cThis is all me, no surgery. I have excellent bone structure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have very <i>familiar</i> bone structure,\u201d Howard concedes, putting the gun in his pocket at last. \u201cOkay, my friend, let\u2019s say I believe you. What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>May as well go for broke. \u201cI need you to build a time machine and send me home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard laughs. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t ask for much, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s been a really long time since I\u2019ve asked you for anything</i>, Tony thinks. <i>But if you do this for me it will make up for a lot.</i> Out loud, he just says, \u201cI know you can do it. I know you helped turn Steve Rogers into Captain America, and I know they\u2019re going to ask you to work on the Manhattan Project. Maybe that hasn\u2019t happened yet, but they will.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>Howard\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cRebirth <i>works</i>?\u201d he asks, incredulous.</p>\n<p><i>Fuck</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened yet either?\u201d Tony asks, wondering just how god damned early in the war he\u2019s actually arrived.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>tomorrow</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard introduces Tony to Colonel Phillips as his brother, Gregory Stark, newly flown in from Zurich, complete with a Nazi-busting change of heart. Phillips shrugs and accepts it, along with the identity card he\u2019d forged with disturbing ease; Howard\u2019s a known quantity, and he\u2019s been very, very helpful to the war effort already, providing cash and equipment as well as ideas, so they\u2019re only too glad to have another Stark on the team. Tony\u2019s head spins at the ease with which he can walk into a top-secret facility, but then, a <i>real</i> Nazi spy did too.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never claimed to be particularly in touch with his feelings, but he still fails entirely to fathom what it will do to him to see Steve Rogers, version 1.0. It almost breaks his heart to look at him. And yeah, sure, intellectually he\u2019d known that pre-serum Steve was tiny, and frail, and so, so very young, he\u2019d even seen the sepia-tinted pictures, but seeing it with his own eyes is really something else.</p>\n<p>Howard notices him staring, and nudges him. \u201cHe\u2019s something isn\u2019t he?\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to meet him?\u201d</p>\n<p>And wow, yes, yes, <i>yes</i>; it\u2019s barely been twenty-four hours and Tony already <i>misses</i> him, but, \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s better that I don\u2019t,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Better. So he stays up in the observation booth, with Colonel Phillips and Senator Brandt and all the other bigwigs, looking down like Roman emperors on the arena below. Peggy Carter joins them at the last minute, and God, she really is beautiful, and for a lone woman in a room full of obvious posturing assholes, she carries herself with incredible grace and poise. It\u2019s easy to see why Steve loved her. </p>\n<p>Howard seems oddly nervous; it\u2019s hard to imagine him ever having been less than perfectly confident, about anything, but of course this is his first huge leap, the one that made everything subsequent possible.</p>\n<p>Steve grits his teeth for the serum infusion, but it\u2019s when Howard throws the switch and lets the vita-rays loose, and Steve starts screaming like he\u2019s being murdered, that Tony almost loses it. If he didn\u2019t know for sure that it was going to work, that Steve will be okay, and better than okay, he\u2019d be joining Peggy in shouting for Howard to shut it down. And then, like he hasn\u2019t just been screaming himself hoarse, Steve insists, <i>\u201cI can do this!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>When Howard pulls off his goggles and steps back to admire his own handiwork, the manic grin is one Tony\u2019s intimately familiar with, that of a man applauding his own genius. Of course <i>he\u2019s</i> usually looking at a breakthrough in mechanical engineering, not a human being he\u2019s just experimented on. Speaking of, Steve is clambering out of his metal coffin, and even though Tony\u2019s been up close and personal with those muscles a hundred times by now, it\u2019s <i>still</i> something. When Howard\u2019s fingers spread out across Steve\u2019s abdomen, and Peggy has to hold herself back from doing the same, it does something weird to his insides, but he can\u2019t even blame them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s incredibly hard to stay still once the shooting starts, much worse than he\u2019d thought it would be. When Steve kneels over the dying Erskine, the look of despair on his face as the old man imparts his final message sends Tony spiralling back to a cave in Afghanistan, and a man who told him he could be more than he was, and better. </p>\n<p>Howard\u2019s furious that Tony didn\u2019t even try to warn him, and he storms out of the complex, abandoning him to his fate. Tony sits down amongst the wreckage and waits as everyone else drifts off; Howard\u2019s smart, he\u2019ll figure out the butterfly effect on his own. Sure enough, he comes back a couple of hours later, and stands a safe distance away, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you at least tell me that we win the war?\u201d he asks at last, and the gleam in his eye is desperate. He\u2019s a man who knows that things are going to get worse, much worse, before they get better.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, and he\u2019s genuinely sorry. His whole life is built on the fact that he <i>inherited</i> his position as a merchant of death, and he\u2019s never thought about the fact that Howard didn\u2019t <i>choose</i> that as a legacy. He was forced into it as much as Tony was, in his own way. \u201cBut I can tell you that Stark Industries is going to be pretty god damned important.\u201d </p>\n<p>Howard smiles wanly, accepting the implication in place of a guarantee.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou run the company now, Tony?\u201d he asks. \u201cIn the future, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs. \u201cI used to. I\u2019m pretty busy with other projects now. We\u2019ve expanded a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and my favourite nephew. So I don\u2019t have kids of my own?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony chokes. \u201cDid you <i>want</i> any?\u201d he asks, can\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I did,\u201d Howard says, looking into the middle distance thoughtfully. \u201cFamily\u2019s important. But not in a world like this. I\u2019d want to fix it first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Months pass without much progress on the time machine front. Howard does try to help; he just doesn\u2019t have the time to spare. There\u2019s a war on, after all. His talents are in demand everywhere, Colonel Phillips and SSR in Italy locked in conflict with General Groves from the Corps of Engineers, who wants him to move permanently to Los Alamos. With typical Stark insouciance, Howard uses the fact that he can fly himself from site to site to avoid committing to either, heading home to New York as often as he can. </p>\n<p>The strain is beginning to tell, though, and he\u2019s changing visibly from the guy who thought nothing of stopping off for fondue after an unauthorised flight into enemy territory, to a man who spends twenty hours a day in the lab, and only stops working when he passes out from exhaustion, or, more and more often, too much scotch. It\u2019s the first time Tony\u2019s truly appreciated what it must have been like for others \u2013 Rhodey, Pepper, even Steve \u2013 watching him over the years.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s going stir-crazy himself, cooped up in the mansion. He has a million ideas, things he\u2019s wanted to try before but never moved beyond the abstract on, and for a while it\u2019s almost fun, kicking it old school, drawing up blueprints by hand. He\u2019s itching to actually construct the thing, though \u2013 even if he wasn\u2019t focused on the endgame, he hasn\u2019t gone so long without <i>building something</i> since he was a teenager \u2013 but everything he needs is either years from being invented, or on the embargoed materials list. </p>\n<p>Howard brings bits and pieces back with him when he can, but the last thing they want is to draw attention. The Manhattan District guys have finally figured out that security is serious business, cottoning to the fact that the Soviets might be allies now, but they won\u2019t be forever. He offers to take Tony to Italy, let him work out his frustrations in the weapons labs, but he can\u2019t stand the thought of watching Steve moon over Peggy, either, so he stays in New York, using every trick he knows, and a few he makes up on the fly, to overclock the computers and get some decent processing power.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stop thinking about Steve back home, <i>his</i> Steve; what he\u2019s doing, how he\u2019s feeling, if the others are taking care of him. He\u2019s already had his heart broken once, and Tony promised him a second chance, and now he\u2019s fucked that up, too, through his own carelessness. If he doesn\u2019t figure out a way back then Steve is going to be alone and miserable all over again, and that is somehow far, <i>far</i> worse than the fact that Tony is going to be alone and miserable for the rest of his life too, without even Dummy and Butterfingers for company, because he is exiled in a technological wasteland. </p>\n<p>He built the Iron Man prototype in a cave, with a box of scraps; it feels like it shouldn\u2019t be so god damned hard to work this out. The fact is, though, the assorted junk he had to work with in that cave was culled from the very best of Stark technology. Here and now, the combined Allied atomic program is hamstrung by the scarcity of fissionable material; it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s going to have to use the arc reactor as his power source, and he can\u2019t risk that till he\u2019s absolutely sure, or absolutely desperate. </p>\n<p>He takes his mind off things by fine-tuning some of Howard\u2019s prototypes, just enough to feel like he\u2019s contributing, without actually telling him anything that will let him blow up the planet. Technically, he\u2019ll figure that one out on his own, once he\u2019s at Los Alamos full time, but it\u2019s probably best he not figure out how to blow a hole in the <i>universe</i>.</p>\n<p>Things come to a head when Howard returns from Europe in a towering rage. </p>\n<p>\u201cPack your things,\u201d he says as he crashes into the lab, no time to waste on anything as mundane as a greeting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to London.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can, and you are,\u201d Howard insists. \u201cOr, so help me-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told me nothing except some fairy-tale about a future that isn\u2019t going to happen unless we make it happen!\u201d He\u2019s completely wired, the obvious signs of a Benzedrine high in his wide eyes and the way his hands are shaking. \u201cNow you come with me voluntarily, or I will have you arrested and shipped out in a crate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Tony says, desperate to believe it, though whether that\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t rate his chances once anyone else sees the reactor, or because he\u2019s actually grown, God help him, to almost <i>like</i> Howard and is shocked to see him falling apart, even he can\u2019t tell. </p>\n<p>Howard collapses like his strings have been cut. \u201cNo,\u201d he agrees, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. But I need help. I need help, and I can\u2019t keep doing this by myself. What is the <i>point</i> of having a family if you can\u2019t rely on them for anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>That is the lowest blow of <i>all time</i>. \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to <i>be</i> here,\u201d Tony retorts, \u201cI-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Howard sighs. \u201cYour father. I went to see him. We haven\u2019t spoken since your grandfather\u2019s funeral, but I still thought if I <i>asked</i> him he\u2019d come back. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, for your sake, but I won\u2019t forgive him for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Howard says. \u201cBut please. I need you. You\u2019re all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder Howard is starting to crack. SSR HQ is buzzing like a hornet\u2019s nest and every single technical request comes direct to him. He\u2019s working on reverse-engineering the weapons they\u2019ve captured in raids on Hydra bases, developing countermeasures for said weapons, and finding a way to use gravitic conversion to enable vertical take-off of fixed wing aircraft, as well as consulting with U Cal by telex on a hybrid mass spectrometer/calutron to diffuse uranium, all at the same time. </p>\n<p>Tony takes the last and blatantly lies, using Howard\u2019s cypher book and authentication codes to identify himself, and speculating about gaseous and thermal diffusion. All three methods will be in use within another year anyway; the head start will hardly hurt. If Stark winds up getting the credit, it serves the army and navy right for not co-operating with each other in the first place. He\u2019s more careful with the weapons because everything that came out of that research is still so heavily classified he\u2019s not sure how far the projects actually got, and the scope for error is massive.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fantastic rush, working on such incredible projects with someone who is smart enough not only to keep up, but sometimes to actually get ahead of him. The fact he knows for sure the outcome of the war \u2013 he\u2019s confident he hasn\u2019t done anything to fuck that up at least \u2013 means he has a level of comfort and confidence that Howard and the other scientists don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still not <i>remotely</i> comfortable or confident enough to cope when he walks into their shared apartment after a long day to find Howard Stark, Bucky Barnes, Peggy Carter, and <i>Steve Rogers</i> playing blackjack in a sea of empty bottles and over-flowing ash trays and half-eaten cans of food. Howard and Bucky are completely hammered, and even Peggy looks flushed and delighted, where she\u2019s eating smoked oysters out of a jar he can only assume Howard flew in, in complete defiance of all rationing.</p>\n<p>Steve, of course, is stone-cold sober, and he leaps to his feet and crosses the room, hand extended. \u201cSteve Rogers, sir,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the mess; we\u2019re on twenty-four hour leave passes, you know how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony has no idea how it is, but he can imagine. Twenty-four hours away from the war, twenty-four hours to see your friends and loved ones. He\u2019s amazed they\u2019re not all screwing like crazed weasels.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s smile begins to falter, and he drops his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll clear everyone out,\u201d he says, \u201cand let you get to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tony says, \u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d He catches Steve\u2019s wrist and pulls back to shake his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smiles, and it\u2019s as heart-stopping as it\u2019s always been. Will always be. \u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m To-\u201d </p>\n<p>It all comes crashing home like a mortar to the chest, leaving him reeling. <i>\u201cI\u2019m Greg Stark.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>They wind up leaving after all, but together, Steve smiling sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could use the fresh air,\u201d he admits. \u201cI don\u2019t get asthma anymore, but sometimes I still feel like the smoke is going to set me off. Howard says it\u2019s psychosomatic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou spend a lot of time with him?\u201d Tony asks. He\u2019s exhausted \u2013 he\u2019s been up for four days and even Howard can\u2019t turn chicory into real coffee \u2013 but he will collapse in a gutter before he gives up <i>one minute</i> of Steve\u2019s leave. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s avoided him all this time when he didn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in town. The guys are great, but we all need to get out of each other\u2019s hair occasionally. And it\u2019s nice to talk to someone who remembers I have a brain as well as a good throwing arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a thing? I mean, do people forget a lot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling tales out of school,\u201d Steve says, laughing. \u201cBut yeah, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>They end up walking the streets all night, stumbling along in the blackout, dodging wardens and steering each other round piles of rubble. It feels like they\u2019ve known each other forever, and for Tony it\u2019s almost true, childhood crush to friends to partners to whatever the hell this is now, one recursive layer on top of another, but for Steve\u2026 Tony\u2019s never, ever believed in love at first sight, but when he actually does pitch headfirst into a gutter, Steve catches him round the waist, pulling him back onto the broken sidewalk, and doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s indecision where Tony wonders how hard he can push, and Steve looks horrified at his own boldness, and then they find themselves huddled against the side of a bombed out row-house, Steve\u2019s greatcoat wrapped around both of them, kissing like their lives depend on it. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s immediately obvious that this isn\u2019t Tony\u2019s experienced, adventurous boyfriend he has his arms locked around; Steve is nervous and clumsy, has no idea where to put his hands or how wide to open his mouth or what to do with his tongue. After the months they\u2019d spent together, the even longer months Tony\u2019s spent here alone, it feels like the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him. The fact that Steve, this Steve, is <i>brave</i> enough to take such a massive chance makes him feel proud and privileged and protective all at once.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s hard against him, he can feel it even through the heavy layers of their coats and clothes, but he\u2019s starting to squirm as much in embarrassment as arousal, and the relief when Tony gently pushes them apart is unmistakeable.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he gasps, \u201cI want to, but I\u2019ve never-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony interrupts, and he means it with every bit of his heart. \u201cI promise you, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky says you have to seize the moment,\u201d Steve says, looking conflicted. \u201cWe could all be dead tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d Tony agrees, though he kind of wants to kick Bucky anyway, just on principle. \u201cBut you still have to be sure. Right time, right person, it\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nods, looking around them at the lightening sky. \u201cCan I come see you next time I\u2019m in London?\u201d he asks at last.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYes, you can. I\u2019ll be here, waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not lost on Tony that he spends longer \u2018dating\u2019 this Steve than he ever did his own. They\u2019re both his own though, he swiftly realises, both the same amazing, kind, generous, <i>loving</i> man; he just met him for the first time when he was reeling from too great a shock and too many losses all at once. He feels a little like a war bride, waiting for Steve to get back from missions, and it\u2019s a whole new kind of painful, letting him go at the end of every leave, but they fall into a routine soon enough.</p>\n<p>They do the things that normal couples do, albeit surreptitiously. They go to pubs and restaurants and to the movies; a <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> instalment Tony\u2019s never seen before, where Basil Rathbone somehow lives long enough to fight the Nazis, and <i>My Friend Flicka</i>, which should be ridiculous but delights the war-weary audience, and <i>I Walked with a Zombie</i>, which Tony thinks is going to be hilarious, but is actually moodily atmospheric and creepy, and provides the perfect excuse to lean in closer to each other in the darkened theatre than is strictly appropriate.</p>\n<p>They make love for the first time one weekend when Steve\u2019s on extended leave, forty-eight hours instead of twenty-four, and Howard\u2019s safely back State-side, checking up on the Los Alamos guys\u2019 progress. It\u2019s a far cry from the heavily orchestrated seductions of Tony\u2019s playboy period, and all the better for it, the most perfectly imperfect thing. Tony keeps his thick woollen sweater on the entire time; Steve makes a half-hearted noise of complaint, but it\u2019s easy to pass off as precaution when air-raid sirens are going off in the distance and they might have to get up and out at any moment.</p>\n<p>They lie there after, wrapped up in each other and in the scratchy blankets, and Steve starts to talk about what he wants to do after the war; will Greg come back to New York with him instead of going back to Switzerland, they\u2019ll have to be careful, of course, but it\u2019ll be worth it, of course it will, won\u2019t you please? And Tony, of course, says yes, <i>yes of course he will</i>, they\u2019ll be together again in New York, and it isn\u2019t even a lie, it <i>isn\u2019t</i>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s not enough time; there\u2019s <i>never</i> enough time. Steve is away for weeks at a stretch, and when he gets back he has to squeeze in lunches with Peggy, and pub crawls with the guys, and cocktail parties that Howard organises that make Tony want to strangle him but which he dutifully turns up and smiles through. When they finally get a moment to themselves it\u2019s inevitably just that, a moment. It\u2019s the most incredible whirlwind of brief encounters, crashing into each other with an intensity bordering on violence, before they\u2019re inevitably pulled apart again.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s as desperate for contact as Tony; ripping at his clothes the second they get behind a locked door, or into the dubious privacy of an abandoned tube station or air raid shelter. They\u2019re always conscious of being caught, and while it adds a certain frisson, Tony would give it all up for some calm, peaceful time together, the languid aftermath of sex he\u2019d always disdained before, and now would trade his entire fortune for. The one upside is that it makes it easier to keep the reactor hidden; they strip just as much as necessary, and after the first time never make it to a bed.</p>\n<p>What few quiet moments they do have, they spend on the couch at the apartment, fully clothed and ready to spring apart at a moment\u2019s notice. Steve loves to trail his fingers across Tony\u2019s cheekbones and trace his eye sockets, stroking his temples with the balls of his thumbs, then shifting down to follow the line of his lips. It becomes a ritual of sorts, memorising every inch before he has to say goodbye, until one day he presses his fingers just hard enough into the base of Tony\u2019s skull to make him shudder and come in his pants. When Tony comes back to himself, Steve is looking down at him in shocked delight.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, still gasping, \u201cI love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The months fly by, and in some ways it\u2019s easier, to at least have a time-frame to work within. Tony knows he can\u2019t disappear until after Steve does \u2013 he resolutely doesn\u2019t think about what that <i>means</i> \u2013 but he also knows he won\u2019t be able to cope here again once Steve\u2019s gone. He works himself to the bone, and he\u2019s just about there, he can <i>feel</i> the answer creeping up on him, just at the edge of his peripheral vision, as all good ideas do. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t help wondering if Howard suspects something, with the amount of time they all spend together, but he never, ever says a word. It\u2019s obvious how much he respects and admires Steve, and in a strange way that Tony still doesn\u2019t know how to feel about, it\u2019s clear he cares about Tony too. For his own part, he feels closer to Howard than he ever did growing up, and with the benefit of adult eyes, and first-hand knowledge, it\u2019s becoming clear that many of their problems were born of the generation wide gulf between them, and their vast differences in life experience.</p>\n<p>Steve cries uncontrollably for hours when Bucky dies. He arrives back in London stony-faced and calm, but Tony knows what that does to you, that kind of repression, and he forces his way through Steve\u2019s defences, and holds him until he stops sobbing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do, if anything happened to you,\u201d Steve says at last, body still shaking in Tony\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen to me,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI promise you, as long as you keep coming back to me, I\u2019ll be there waiting for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Inevitably, the day comes when Steve <i>doesn\u2019t</i> come back.</p>\n<p>Peggy\u2019s on the radio with him when he calls in his final position, and she ignores his pleas not to put him through to the lab; Tony catches the last of him begging her not to. She thinks that Howard will be able to help; Tony knows it\u2019s him Steve doesn\u2019t want to talk to. It\u2019s an open frequency, all of them talking over each other at once, but as it becomes clear they\u2019re saying their goodbyes everyone starts to take their turn. They pretend to be jocular and confident; Peggy promises to take Steve dancing, Colonel Phillips threatens him with fatigue duty for malingering, and Tony tells him to come by the house next time he\u2019s in New York.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d he says, clenching his hands until his fingernails break the skin and make his palms bleed. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly miss it. Fifth Avenue at 70th, the whole damn block.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Steve says. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard just swears he\u2019ll find him. Tony stands back and watches him run around like a maniac, trying to figure out a way. He discards ideas almost faster than thought \u2013 <i>in a plane we could get there while he\u2019s still conscious, in a boat while he\u2019s hypothermic; the serum in his bloodstream will keep his heart beating long enough to prevent brain damage; he\u2019ll freeze rather than drown\u2026</i></p>\n<p>When Tony makes no move to help, Howard punches him in the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my best friend!\u201d he shouts. \u201cYou love him too, I know you do! Don\u2019t give me that <i>shit</i> about the future; it can\u2019t <i>possibly</i> be a better future without him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony just sits on the floor, cradling his broken nose, and ignores the tears that mix with the blood running down his chin. Everyone else is too busy with their own grief to notice.</p>\n<p>They go to the funeral together, the Stark brothers, the two of them in their expensive coats surrounded by soldiers in various states of disrepair. Captain America\u2019s memorial will be at Arlington, attended by generals and politicians, but Steve\u2019s is right here, with his friends.</p>\n<p>The Howling Commandos organise the wake, but the Stark boys drink them right under the table. Phillips took Peggy home hours ago, so it\u2019s just the two of them left, surrounded by unconscious soldiers and empty bottles. <i>Dead soldiers</i>, Tony\u2019s paralytic mind supplies, and he cackles like it\u2019s the funniest thing in the world. He is quite possibly the drunkest he\u2019s ever been in his life, even counting that legendary Spring Break.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the only excuse he can think of, later, for blurting out suddenly, \u201cYou weren\u2019t such a terrible father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard puts down his half-full glass, and just looks at him. He doesn\u2019t seem hugely shocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he says quietly, confirming that Tony\u2019s tongue is still running away with him. \u201cI knew there was no way you could be Greg\u2019s son. You\u2019re nothing like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m like you?\u201d Tony asks, wonderingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Howard says, no doubt at all in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you any more than that, but we will find him some day.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe?\u201d Howard\u2019s face lights up, and it\u2019s heart breaking a thousand times over. Tony never knew he could feel so much pity and affection for his father. \u201cYou and me?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cStark Industries.\u201d </p>\n<p>Howard nods. \u201cBut not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be bitter,\u201d Tony says, and he\u2019s amazed to find that he really, truly means it. \u201cThere\u2019s so much you can do. So much you will do. You\u2019re going to have an amazing life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a pretty amazing son,\u201d Howard agrees. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet you properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s heart seizes up. \u201cActually, I\u2019m pretty much of a disappointment to you,\u201d he manages.</p>\n<p>Howard just looks at him. \u201cWell, this time I know you\u2019re lying,\u201d he says, dead certain. \u201cYou could never have been a disappointment to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d told me that!\u201d Tony explodes. \u201cJust once. It would have meant a lot more to me when I was a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard\u2019s face falls. \u201cI don\u2019t live to see you grow up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony says nothing. What <i>can</i> he say?</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad I got to see it now,\u201d Howard says firmly.</p>\n<p>\n<i>I\u2019m glad too. I am.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Tony reaches across the table and grabs both of Howard\u2019s hands in his. \u201c<i>Dad</i>,\u201d he says, and it feels so strange in his mouth. \u201cDad, please. I need you to get me home. I\u2019m going to go crazy here, and I can\u2019t stand it anymore, not without Steve. I need you to be as brilliant as I know you are, and I need you to get me home. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Howard looks him right in the eye. \u201cIs he good to you, son?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p>\n<p>They wait till the very last second to pull out the arc reactor. Tony knows he only has minutes for Howard to get it wired into the machine they built in the New York lab out of pieces stolen wholesale from SSR and U Cal, and a few more at the other end for him to grab a spare. If they screw up, he\u2019ll barely have time to realise.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Remember</i>,\u201d he insists as the machine powers up. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything with this until the 1960s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Howard says. \u201cI think I\u2019ll use the time to make it bigger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony laughs, \u201cbigger is good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>You</i> remember,\u201d Howard says, as the room lights up and the glass in the windows shatters, \u201cI love you, and I <i>always</i> loved you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony crashes back into consciousness on the floor of his workshop. He <i>thinks</i> it\u2019s his workshop; everything\u2019s covered in drop cloths and neatly put away. He blinks his aching eyes; can just barely make out the armours, locked away in their darkened cabinets.</p>\n<p>He staggers to his feet and feels his way towards the safe. It\u2019s further than he thinks, and he stumbles, almost falls. A strong pair of hands catches him around the waist. Panicked, he tries to push whoever it is away, but they just lean him up against the wall and fumble at his clothes. He really starts to struggle then, but-</p>\n<p>\u201cSsh, ssh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Steve says, and slots the reactor neatly into his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s me, you\u2019re home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, <i>God</i>.</p>\n<p>He collapses into Steve\u2019s waiting arms, even as the lights come on to reveal the Avengers forcing their way through the open door. Natasha\u2019s had her hair cut short; Thor\u2019s, by contrast, is longer. Clint and Bruce are grinning fit to bust. God only knows how long it\u2019s been.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome home, sir,\u201d Jarvis intones. \u201cYou set off the proximity alarms, and I took the liberty of-\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony buries his face in Steve\u2019s chest and tunes everyone else out. Steve\u2019s arms are rock solid around his shoulders, and he wraps his own around his waist in return.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d make it,\u201d Steve whispers in his ear, then pulls back to look him in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re a little late, but I\u2019ll let it pass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLate?\u201d Tony asks, confused. He can vaguely hear the others drifting away, good-naturedly grumbling about his one-track mind, but he only has eyes for Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor our date,\u201d Steve says with a smile, then leans in to kiss him so gently, big hands sliding up to cradle his head the way he has so many times before.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d Tony asks, when they break apart to breathe.</p>\n<p>Steve digs his thumbs into the hollows behind Tony\u2019s jaw, prompting a full-body shiver, and laughs. \u201cFrom the very first time I did this,\u201d he says. \u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you waited?\u201d Tony asks, throat thick.</p>\n<p>Steve just smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve always been willing to wait. For the right time and the right person.\u201d</p>"
