  "text": "<p align=\"justify\">1.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">During a rainy day in the middle of July, the Midoriya family was blessed with a pair of healthy twin boys.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Born four minutes apart, their only differential features were their eye color, with the eldest inheriting the deep red eyes of their father and the youngest the bright green eyes of their mother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They were given the names Tenko and Izuku.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">2.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku found how determined Shigaraki was to glare at him every time he was within the other\u2019s line of sight, as if trying to convey <em>\u2018I don\u2019t know how but this is somehow your fault\u2019</em> with his gaze alone, to be quite impressive.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t find it <em>surprising</em> though. Izuku didn\u2019t think there was much that could surprise him anymore after being reborn as a baby with the guy who killed him as his twin. Hell, he even understood the sentiment behind the sharp looks\u2014 <em>Izuku </em>was stuck like this too after all. He knew it wasn\u2019t fun.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Even so, he was beginning to wonder when Shigaraki, or Tenko now, would finally accept their situation and stop throwing toys in Izuku\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019d been five months already.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hoped it happened before their teeth came in.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Sometime later, Izuku would stare at the single-tooth bite mark embedded in his arm and sigh. This was going to be one long childhood.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>You\u2019re kidding me,</em> Tomura thought, staring with wide eyes at the man who mother had said was their father. He didn\u2019t even have the mind to glare as they were picked up and set comfortably in the man\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Instead, he blankly watched a tiny hand that wasn\u2019t his own reach out and tug on the man\u2019s hair insistently, its owner babbling angrily.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All For One just chuckled amused and pressed kisses on top of both of their heads.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>This is a fucking nightmare, none of this is real,</em> Tomura decided, closing his eyes and resolutely pretending he couldn\u2019t hear the disgustingly gentle and adoring voice next to his ear or mother\u2019s soft laughter in the background or the hero brat\u2019s weak attempts at punching the lord of the underground in the face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The two toddlers wrestling in their room yet again stopped to breathe.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku, who had been peacefully playing with an All Might doll before the other came and broke it, snarled at Tenko before a thought occurred to him and he grinned.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko watched with an iffy expression as Izuku, who had long since learned how to cry at will, slapped his own cheek hard and burst into tears. Loudly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their mother immediately hurried over at the sound and picked him up. As expected, her eyes were staring at the red mark on his face, hand-shaped and toddler-sized.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh my. What happened, Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He sniffled and pointed at Tenko, who had his face scrunched up in confusion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko didn\u2019t even have time to defend himself before mom\u2019s disappointed eyes fell on him and he was being scolded.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When mom finally left, Izuku found himself being the receiver of the harshest glare a toddler could ever give. He just grinned in response and dodged the broken toy thrown his way.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>5.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their relationship would continue to be like this all the way to preschool, much to their poor teacher\u2019s bewilderment, who just couldn\u2019t figure out why these twins hated each other so much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At least they seemed to behave properly when their mom was in sight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>6.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku could tell the exact moment Tenko realized who the loud kid on the other side of the room was by the wide, mildly unsettling grin that took form on the face that was much too similar to his own.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He debated whether to stop him or not, but then remembered that neither of them had quirks right now and simply decided to watch the show instead.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko seemed to have forgotten that when you\u2019re a toddler, no matter how much more experience you had from a past life, three months made quite the difference physically.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And Bakugou Katsuki had never been one to hold himself back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>7.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t start fights, Tenko-kun!\u201d scolded the preschool teacher once he separated the two vicious toddlers, hauling Tenko to a corner of the room. \u201cTime out corner for you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">While she checked Katsuki for injuries, even though he wasn\u2019t the one losing that wrestling match, another teacher came up to Tenko and started lecturing him on how to get along with others.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku knew Tenko could see him snickering from behind the teacher, as proved when the other flipped him off without thinking, cue another lecture from their teacher about respect.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku grinned even wider from the other side of the room.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>8.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ve decided you two are cool enough to hang out with me!\u201d that Bakugou brat declared, grinning widely at the pair in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t care. Get lost,\u201d snapped Tenko at the same time Izuku chirped, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Bakugou blinked at them, looking like he was trying to figure out whom to reply to first.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHey! You can\u2019t just say no!\u201d he ended up shouting, and Tenko just shrugged uninterested.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Watch me,</em> is what he opened his mouth to say, but then he caught sight of a deceptively nice smile accompanied by a pair of calculatingly cold green eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMom said we should make friends, nii-chan. You don\u2019t want to make her sad, right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And that\u2019s how Tenko, once Grand Commander of the Paranormal Liberation Front, ended up being roped into hanging out with a bunch of annoying children\u2014 under the threat of disappointing Midoriya Inko.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a surprisingly effective threat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Much like <em>disappointing Kurogiri</em> had been when he was actually this age.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>9.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko stared at his new shoes with a frown.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He knew these shoes. Had owned this same type for as long as he could remember. He\u2019d worn them as Shimura Tenko, and later on as Shigaraki Tomura, and now again as Midoriya Tenko. His feet forever uncomfortable wearing any other design, so he\u2019d gotten used to the obnoxiously bright red color that went well with literally no outfit in existence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By his side, Izuku had an odd look in his eye as he expertly tied the green shoelaces in a neat bow.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mother had had an almost nervous air around her as she gave them each a pair, informing them that they\u2019d be visiting a quirk doctor later that week to see why their quirks were late.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(The sentence sounded kind of familiar, now that he thought about it.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He stopped himself from scratching his neck by focusing on tying his own shoelaces, baby blue in color, and refusing to think too hard about all this. The shoes must just be really good and cheap or something.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They fit perfectly, why would he question it?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>10.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Izuku, Tenko! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko stood awkwardly in mother\u2019s embrace, unconsciously scratching his temple as he listened to this woman, who he\u2019d come to like and respect, cry apologies.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Feeling at a loss, he looked towards Izuku, expecting to see him in the same position as him, but instead finding a sorrowful smile and understanding eyes. An incredibly jarring sight when coupled with the childish face of a four-year-old.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, mom,\u201d Izuku whispered, placing a hand on mother\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He looked like he had expected this. Maybe he had. Tenko didn\u2019t know anything about Izuku\u2019s backstory, had never cared to know before. It made him wonder if Izuku had been in this position before, having to listen to this unbelievably kind woman break down because of something outside of her control.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He wondered how Izuku had reacted back then, when he was an actual four-year-old hearing such a damning diagnosis.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine even if we don\u2019t have quirks, mom.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words only seemed to make her cry harder.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>11.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHey brat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026do you think All For One did something to us?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat, like taking our quirks before we manifested them and have that doctor of his show mom fake radiographs?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku hummed thoughtful, then shrugged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe might have,\u201d he replied simply. \u201cOr maybe we were just born like this. We\u2019re a second generation from his side of the family. It\u2019s plausible.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko frowned, considering it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat reminds me,\u201d Izuku added, finally looking up from that notebook he was always writing on. \u201cDid you ever figure out which one of your quirks brought us here?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhich one of my\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku looked at him weird, \u201cThere was no one nearby when we died in the future, so it had to have been you, no?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko racked his brain, trying to recall their final fight. Whether it was a side effect of the reincarnation or due to the quirk overuse he\u2019d been suffering back then, he couldn\u2019t remember much from that time anymore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The image of the hero\u2019s bloodied body by the end was still quite clear, but aside from that, the rest of that day \u2014of that week, of that <em>month</em> really\u2014 was no more than a blur.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But he did have to agree that he\u2019d had many quirks at his disposal at that time and that he only knew what some of them did for sure. The idea wasn\u2019t completely unfounded.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s green eyes fell on him then, giving the impression that they were looking at his very soul. Tenko resisted the urge to scratch his neck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Izuku said incredulous. It wasn\u2019t a question. Then, he sighed, \u201cOh well. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter much now.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko nodded absently, and that was the end of that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>12.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko was sure he would start killing people if he noticed one more NPC looking at him with pity. As it was, he settled for scratching his arm as a distraction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He wasn\u2019t stupid, he knew that being quirkless in this society that adored quirks over everything else was bound to be difficult\u2014 mother\u2019s reaction was more than enough confirmation of this. But he wasn\u2019t expecting it to be this bad, especially since he was only four years old physically.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The brats who always looked at him in fear of pissing him off were suddenly looking at him like he was something to be pitied, like he was somehow weaker than them even though many of them had completely useless quirks like the ability to change eye color or grow their hair a little faster than normal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The worst though, in his opinion, were the whispers among the adults when they thought he was too far away to hear.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">God, how he missed having Decay.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(But that was the problem, wasn\u2019t it? That he didn\u2019t have that ability. That he didn\u2019t have <em>anything</em> at all anymore. Just a pair of red shoes and a drawer full of laces of all colors.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Izuku had explained to him, oblivious to the growing dread inside Tenko, that the laces on this type of shoes had meanings for quirkless people. At least, some colors did. Black meant doing good and willing to help, grey meant they were managing, and white was practically a cry for help, sticking out like a sore thumb in the already eye-catching red.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Izuku always wore black, the little hero.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A hand on his snapped him out of his thoughts and forced his scratching to stop, leaving the skin of his arm red and irritated. He turned around to see green eyes framed by a disgustingly kind expression.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku seemed unaffected by the looks and whispers, seemed used to this kind of treatment already. It made Tenko wonder if that\u2019s how his life was going to be from now on, pretending to not hear the insults or see the pitiful glances directed his way anywhere he went the moment they saw his stupidly bright red shoes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It made him wonder how Izuku ever managed to become the hero brat he\u2019d met in the future if everyone only acted like this around him up until he got All Might\u2019s quirk. Tenko would\u2019ve gone crazy and attacked someone within a couple years for sure.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat?\u201d he grumbled, shaking off the hand the same way he shook off those thoughts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku didn\u2019t even blink, of course he didn\u2019t, and instead simply pointed somewhere behind him with a smile that somehow felt too real and too fake at the same time. Izuku was far too good of an actor, he\u2019d found.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWanna play in the bars, nii-chan?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko frowned out of habit, but soon nodded.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not like he had anything better to do anyways, and mother would get sad if he got into another fight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(He tried to not make mother sad anymore. He\u2019d seen the look in her eyes when she saw his scuffed clothes the other day when she picked them up from preschool. He\u2019d much rather she just scolded him like she used to than seeing that annoying expression again.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>13.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cShut up, you crybaby! You\u2019re just a useless <em>Deku!\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko froze in his tracks, slowly turning around to look at where Izuku and that Bakugou brat were standing by the other side of the playground.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was frowning but he didn\u2019t look all that bothered overall, which only made him all the more confused.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s mean, Kacchan,\u201d he answered simply, like nothing was wrong at all. Like everything made sense when it was far from that in Tenko\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>What the fuck\u2014 wasn\u2019t Deku his hero name\u2014 why would he choose a literal insult as his hero name\u2014 why the hell would he ever want to be known by that name\u2014 why why <strong>why\u2014</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But for some reason, Tenko, whose number of questions only grew with each second that passed, couldn\u2019t bring himself to voice any of them right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cShut up, you stupid Deku!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko had no recollection of how he got there, but one moment he was on one side of the playground, staring at the smoke coming from that Bakugou brat\u2019s fist, watching as it connected with his brother\u2019s face\u2014 and the next Bakugou was under him and explosions were going off in his face as someone shouted and hands were <em>grabbing him from behind\u2014</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The world blurred.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>14.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s voice was quiet, barely louder than a whisper, as he examined Tenko\u2019s bruised knuckles. He sounded tired, and Tenko found it infuriating that he couldn\u2019t see his face from here.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They were sitting side by side in the empty hallway outside the director\u2019s office, waiting for their mother to come pick them up, the blonde brat having already been sent home some time ago.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSeriously, Tenko. He\u2019s five,\u201d Izuku insisted when he didn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhy was your hero name Deku?\u201d Tenko asked instead of replying. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Why would Izuku ever choose that as his hero name? Even with the limited understanding Tenko had of Izuku\u2019s past life, it made no sense for him to do that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku didn\u2019t answer immediately, but if there was something Tenko had learned in the past five years, it was to be patient.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Kurogiri would be proud, it suddenly occurred to him.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSomeone said it sounded like <em>dekiru</em> and I liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko frowned.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMaybe,\u201d Izuku allowed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He still didn\u2019t get it, didn\u2019t get why Izuku would choose an insult as his name even if someone redefined its meaning, didn\u2019t get how something like that could ever make the word Deku, <em>useless,</em> sound any better in his ears.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t get it at all.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t ask though.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMom\u2019s gonna be so worried,\u201d Izuku commented randomly, when the silence stretched for too long.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll get punished?\u201d he asked, belatedly realizing he\u2019d never been actually punished in his past life. Kurogiri used to scold him, obviously, but as Tomura he\u2019d been given a lot of leeway.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(All For One used to punish him, when expectations weren\u2019t met or Tomura happened to be too annoying and he was in a cruel mood. Looking back now however, Sensei\u2019s parenting style and subsequent punishing methods were not something he\u2019d expect from a normal, decent parent like Midoriya Inko.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The realization was\u2026 enlightening. To an uncomfortable level.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDunno,\u201d Izuku hummed noncommittally. \u201cShe let me get away with a lot after the diagnosis the first time around, but I never got into a fist fight with anybody. Not this young anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko raised an eyebrow at him, \u201cBut you did later?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSomeone had to stand up to Kacchan,\u201d Izuku shrugged, like it was to be expected. Maybe it was, from his perspective. Heroic vision and all that. \u201cThey were less like fights and more like beatings though.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko frowned again, not sure how to answer that, but a worried voice calling their names saved him from having to think of a response and the conversation was dropped in favor of reassuring their mother that they were, in fact, just fine and that she didn\u2019t need to worry and <em>yes we\u2019re really okay mother please stop crying\u2026</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>15.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Tenko and Izuku went back to class on Monday, Bakugou was already there, playing with some other brats. His face was obscured by All Might band aids and one of his eyes had a dark bruise under it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Bakugou spotted them and flinched, much to Tenko\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His injuries wouldn\u2019t even leave a scar yet the brat had been wailing like crazy when his parent showed up to pick him up. It\u2019d been extremely annoying to hear.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko\u2019s injuries were worse than his, anyhow, since he received the brunt of his explosions and kicks \u2014as weak as they were at this age\u2014 and he was also covered in yellow band aids, but you didn\u2019t see <em>him</em> complaining.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By his side, Izuku sighed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko paid him no mind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>16.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It took exactly three weeks for Bakugou to try to bully Izuku again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko found the fact that his twin didn\u2019t seem at all surprised by this development to be more upsetting than the blonde brat\u2019s loud voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t get why he felt like this, though, which only helped to worsen his mood <em>and</em> the itching.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>17.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their sixth birthday passed by much like how the previous one had, much like how all future ones would.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A small celebration with their mother, watching their favorite movies and eating their favorite foods.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A short call from a father they were grateful they never had to see.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A couple presents they opened and took pictures with when their mother asked.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nothing too big, nothing too tiresome.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They enjoyed it all the same.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>18.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Elementary school was a new experience for him, one that absolutely sucked. In his first run, Tenko had been homeschooled by Kurogiri and trained by various villains who he was fairly sure had ended up as Nomu afterwards.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Point was, he never had to attend an actual school in his life before. And while preschool had also been a weird experience, it certainly hadn\u2019t been anywhere near as bad as elementary.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Tenko hadn\u2019t been the leader of a large group of villains for nothing. It didn\u2019t take him long to realize school sucked a lot less once he asserted his dominance.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Yes, people still talked shit about his quirklessness all the damn time, the fucking shoes obvious even to the most dense of kids, but at least no one dared to say something to his or Izuku\u2019s faces anymore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Bakugou Katsuki was an exception to the rule, of course, but that brat had been deemed a lost cause from the beginning and Tenko didn\u2019t mind beating him up every now and again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>19.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIf you hang another fucking All Might poster on the wall, I\u2019m gonna punch you so hard your teeth will fall off.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku just stared him dead in the eye and slowly unrolled the All Might poster he\u2019d sneakily bought earlier while Tenko wasn\u2019t looking.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko screeched in frustration and threw a pillow at him, then decided that wasn\u2019t enough and threw himself at Izuku as well.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>20.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku stared at Tenko\u2019s side of the room in amazement. Hung on the wall, there was an honestly impressive poster of Eraserhead that Izuku knew for a fact wasn\u2019t sold in any stores.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(God knows how long he and Shinsou spent searching for merchandise of their teacher only to end up commissioning an artist because there just <em>wasn\u2019t any.)</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWow\u2026 did you paint that yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko was crossing his arms with a smug expression, but his face was clearly blushing. He was not exempt from the Midoriya genes, amusingly enough.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat, you jealous of my skill level?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku just shook his head. He actually was a pretty decent artist himself, but he just didn\u2019t bother painting like Tenko did and instead stuck mostly to sketches. It made sense for him to do that, though, since he mostly just drew to complement his analysis, be it about heroes, villains, or just random quirks he saw on the street.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Of course, he didn\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m thinking that you could paint a mural in here that was a mix of both our interests, nii-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not painting fucking All Might,\u201d came the immediate refusal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had expected this, but he couldn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t disappointed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>21.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDo you think there\u2019s another you living somewhere with All For One right now?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko blinked, looked up from his homework, and proceeded to make a face that was three parts disturbed and one part absolutely fucking bewildered.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026how the fuck should <em>I</em> know?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku just shrugged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDunno. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask though.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt hurts my peace of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHow unfortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>22.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their ninth birthday came and went, but there was a distinctive lack of a phone call from a certain someone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A week later, their mother sat them down and explained that their father had been involved in a terrible accident and that he was still staying in America while he recovered.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko and Izuku exchanged a glance, knowing full well that said \u2018accident\u2019 was in reality a fight to death against Japan\u2019s number one hero.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Oh well, the fucker had it coming.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>23.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cOh hell no,\u201d</em> Tenko hissed, eyes wide as he stared transfixed at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. If goddamned Toga suddenly crawled out from it covered in blood and tried to cut him open with a butter knife, he\u2019d feel less horrified.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not even bothering to dry his hair, he hastily threw on a hoodie and stormed out to the living room, where his mother and Izuku were chilling.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMother,\u201d he called, tone more desperate than he intended but not entirely exaggerated given the circumstances. They turned to look at him in confusion. \u201cWe need to buy hair dye.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His mother\u2019s brow furrowed a little, but she didn\u2019t immediately shoot him down, which was good because while he\u2019d rather not go behind her back and earn that I\u2019m-not-mad-just-disappointed look, not even All Might himself could stop him right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d she asked after a beat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Foregoing words entirely, he shoved the top of his hair in their line of sight, pointing at the <em>goddamned white roots</em> that had started to appear. When he looked up again, Izuku was wincing sympathetically, a hand lightly touching his own (still fully green) hair as if in reassurance.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mother, on the other hand, seemed awfully <em>delighted.</em> \u201cOh, just like your father!\u201d she exclaimed, clapping her hands in front of her.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku and Tenko cringed simultaneously, a reaction that went fully unnoticed by their mother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said pointedly, bringing her out of whatever memory she was reliving. \u201cI like dark hair better. Can I please dye it, mother?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut white would look so good on you, Tenko,\u201d mother tried to reassure, the words managing to do anything but. \u201cYou even have your dad\u2019s red eyes and freckles\u2014 you\u2019d just look even more like him! You\u2019d look very handsome!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko barely stopped the reflexive flinch. Locking eyes with Izuku, he abruptly realized he was currently ten years old and made the impulsive decision to <em>fucking act like it.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One tantrum the likes he hadn\u2019t had since his pre-League days later, Tenko walked out of the bathroom sporting newly black hair and a wild grin. Izuku snorted and shot him a thumbs-up.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>24.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko squinted suspiciously at Izuku, who had spent the last four and a half hours hyper-focused on something in his laptop.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d he found himself asking, when curiosity got the best of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cGetting my teacher fired.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAh,\u201d Tenko muttered, nodding, \u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t bother asking which one. Middle school started less than two weeks ago and Tenko had yet to learn any of his teachers\u2019 names. Asking would make no difference to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWant lemonade?\u201d he offered instead, because he could always get behind some good ol\u2019 life ruining. He <em>was</em> a villain, after all.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019d be great, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>25.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you going to become a hero again?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko really had to wonder how he\u2019d never thought to ask before, considering he\u2019s interacted with Izuku every day for the past almost-thirteen years but\u2026 Well, he supposed it didn\u2019t matter since he was asking now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku didn\u2019t look up from where he was stretching on the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d he started after he straightened up, pointedly gesturing between himself and the weapons and items he somehow managed to acquire for his new hobby. Tenko was sure he didn\u2019t <em>buy</em> them, their allowance wasn\u2019t large enough for him to have done that, but for the sake of the image of Izuku as the \u2018good guy\u2019 he had preserved in his mind, Tenko refused to question whether his twin stole them from somewhere or not.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It wasn\u2019t because he was <em>scared</em> of Izuku, of course not. Tenko wasn\u2019t scared of anything, much less of some hero brat with as much determination as All Might had fans and with an eerily similar gaze to\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko wasn\u2019t scared, full stop.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(His neck itched, but he stubbornly kept his hand where it was.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the plan, yeah,\u201d Izuku finished deadpan.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t mean your vigilantism, moron,\u201d Tenko rolled his eyes, pushing his many questions to the back of his mind. \u201cI mean going to UA again.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI guess so?\u201d At his raised eyebrow, Izuku elaborated, \u201cI don\u2019t have any other dreams or anything, so I might as well.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He watched quietly as Izuku secured all his knifes around his surprisingly high-quality vigilante outfit, before asking another question.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat about All Might\u2019s quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku hummed, \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you trying to get it back or\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That made his brother pause, staring back at Tenko with a pair of toxic green eyes that never got any less unnerving. Ah, there it was again, that little voice in the back of his mind whispering that they looked much too similar to a certain supervillain\u2019s eyes even if the color was different.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Did Tenko\u2019s eyes look like that too?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He pushed that thought out of his mind with the grace of someone who\u2019d lived for years in complete and utter denial about most things related to his new <em>(and past) </em>life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Izuku admitted after a beat. \u201cIf he offers, I\u2019ll accept. But if he doesn\u2019t then I\u2019ll just become a quirkless hero this time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko nodded, accepting the answer easily. It was a very Izuku-like answer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBeing underground like Eraserhead has gotta be a lot better than being limelight too,\u201d Tenko muttered to himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He was pulled back from his thoughts by Izuku\u2019s teasing voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe could even be the first ever quirkless hero duo, nii-chan. Think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hoped his expression conveyed exactly how he felt about the idea, and Izuku laughed as he walked towards their bedroom window.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell then, I\u2019ll be off,\u201d he said cheerfully, securing the voice modulator around his neck and pulling up his black, veil-like mask.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGet out of here already, dumbass.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko could hear his twin snickering even after he jumped out the window.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>26.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta saw the small figure crouching down at the edge of the next roof over and immediately turned back around. This figure, he could tell, was the reason the pile of paperwork on Tsukauchi\u2019s desk had suddenly increased in size in the past three weeks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Nope not me I\u2019m not interacting with this guy nope\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh, hey Eraserhead!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Goddamn it.</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>27.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Much to Shouta\u2019s dismay, the vigilante continued to hang out around him whenever they happened to run into each other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At least Y\u016brei wasn\u2019t too annoying and was actually competent in what he did. That was more than he could say about many of his coworkers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>28.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For Eri, hope was green eyes and freckles.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>29.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2014police reports say that the attack took place during the early hours this morning, leaving no survivors. Police and heroes had been investigating this group known as the Shie Hassaikai for some time now, but it seems that someone beat them to their goal\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko tuned out the rest of the news and slowly turned to stare at the \u2018someone\u2019 that had somehow massacred Overhaul\u2019s entire organization within a couple hours.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His twin blinked back at him, the picture of innocence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIzuku,\u201d he said, then paused. He considered the best way to express the sentiment he wanted conveyed in as few words as possible and promptly decided to throw eloquence out the window. \u201cWhat the actual <em>fuck.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A frown took over Izuku\u2019s face then.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWatch your language around Eri.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The toddler in question, who Izuku had just brought into the house that morning with some bullshit explanation, was currently talking with mother on the other room while they waited for social services to show up.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe\u2019re older brothers now,\u201d Izuku continued, nodding sagely to reinforce his point. \u201cWe have to be good role models for her.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko pointedly didn\u2019t mention that that was <em>not</em> confirmed. Izuku spoke like adopting that child into the family was the expected, no, the <em>only</em> possible outcome, and Tenko knew better than to try to convince him otherwise, especially with how sleep deprived he\u2019d been since he started going out five nights of the week. It reminded him, vaguely, of Kurogiri telling him Dabi and Toga and the others were useful assets and that he should try to get along with them better.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko shut that train of thought and scratched his arm absently.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Had Izuku always been this violent? Deku-the-hero had been the most ride-or-die person Tenko had ever met in either life, but he didn\u2019t remember him being this inclined to murder?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku abruptly snorted at what a reporter said, eyes alight with something that wasn\u2019t quite <em>cruelty</em> but definitely resembled <em>vindictive</em> <em>gratification.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Well, Tenko thought mildly. He sure was now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a little unsettling to think that Izuku, once considered the unofficial successor of the number one hero, was going through some kind of villain arc while Tenko, the guy who almost destroyed society once upon a time, hadn\u2019t committed a single crime in over a decade.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fuck, what had the world come to.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>30.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Tenko heard his brother stumble into their room sometime past two in the morning, he didn\u2019t even bother turning around. Izuku actually came back earlier than usual tonight, which was good because the guy could use some rest, but it wasn\u2019t weird enough for Tenko to take his eyes from his work.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He had decided to try his hand at coding recently, partially to get started on game development and stuff and mostly as a way to kill time. Who knew going through childhood a second time would get so boring? No wonder Izuku had been so eager to re-start patrolling the moment he was strong enough to not get himself killed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Izuku said after a beat, obnoxiously ignoring the do-not-talk-to-me-leave-me-alone-do-not-bother-me aura Tenko was projecting. \u201cGood news and bad news.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He sighed internally, flicking his eyes to the ceiling. He knew from experience that any attempts at ignoring Izuku would be futile.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell then? Spit it out already.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRight, so. Good news is that I\u2019ve confirmed the existence of the other you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko felt himself freeze at the words but Izuku barely gave him any time to process them before he continued.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBad news is I forgot just how unstable you used to be and got my arm disintegrated for it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cYou what.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He whipped around, finally taking in the sight of his dumbass brother nonchalantly leaning against the wall while blood poured out of his (thankfully still there) right arm and onto their bedroom floor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had the gall to give him a sheepish smile.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMind getting the first aid kit for me, nii-chan? I lost mine on the way back.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a testament to Tenko\u2019s growth as a person that he didn\u2019t immediately give in to his urge to strangle the absolute fucking<em> moron</em> in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>31.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh god, how could you let this happen?! My babies\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku winced, offering Mei an apologetic look.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Though, despite the question being directed at him, the girl paid him no mind as she examined her mostly disintegrated inventions. Shigaraki Tomura had done a number not only on Izuku himself, but also on the support items that he\u2019d had Mei build for his vigilantism.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku may be strong but he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to fight villains empty handed, and since he had no experience building anything, he\u2019d sought out the only person he knew that did and wouldn\u2019t ask unwanted questions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Newly-thirteen-years-old Hatsume Mei had been more than a little ecstatic to have a client too, but because Izuku didn\u2019t have any money to his name, he\u2019d instead offered a deal. He would clean out Dagobah beach and collect all useful materials for her to use for free as well as work as her beta tester, and in turn she would build any items he needed from now on.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And Mei, bless her, had accepted.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSorry, Mei-chan,\u201d he apologized again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She waved a hand, sighing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t think I can repair these with how destroyed they are, Izu-kun,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna hafta build new ones from scratch, is there anything else you wanna add? Any upgrades in mind? Maybe I should reinforce everything so it lasts longer this time\u2014 oh but I don\u2019t wanna restrict your mobility\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku nodded, internally relieved that she wasn\u2019t mad at him, and moved closer to start planning with her. Mei truly was a great inventor and an even greater friend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>32.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s been <em>two months.</em> Where the hell have you been?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku blinked at Eraserhead\u2019s glare. He\u2019d be lying if he said he\u2019d been expecting this kind of greeting after finally being free of his brother\u2019s glares every time he so much as looked at his new vigilante outfit for too long.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The overprotectiveness wasn\u2019t new but it still continued to baffle him after all these years.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026were you worried?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnswer my question, Y\u016brei.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Definitely worried,</em> Izuku thought, offering an apologetic look to the person who was his teacher but also not.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cMy equipment got damaged and took some time to repair.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eraserhead narrowed his eyes at him, but accepted the half-truth with only a warning to let him know next time he decided to go off the radar.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The hand-shaped scar on his upper arm itched, but Izuku ignored it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>33.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Any villain worth their salt had heard about the new vigilante-slash-informant that showed up about a year ago and quickly made a name for themselves. \u2018Y\u016brei\u2019 was a name that inspired all sorts of emotions in people involved in Japan\u2019s underworld, from fear, despair, and uneasiness, to hope, faith, and even relief.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And the person behind that name was someone known for their reliability and intelligence, for their ruthlessness and thoroughness. They were known for their extensive information network, for their overwhelming strength, and for their impressive track record in obliterating the lives or careers of any and all people they found to be\u2026 unacceptable, by their own standards.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Nobody knew for sure what those standards were, but most could make an educated guess by now.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In short, Y\u016brei was someone you didn\u2019t want to piss off.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi, of course, knew about all this and made a point of staying the fuck away from the guy, lest he ended up like that old Yakuza group from a couple months ago. And even if Dabi considered himself to be a pretty decent guy within the villain spectrum, he wasn\u2019t about to risk it with Y\u016brei.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not that his intentions seemed to matter at all now, considering he was in the middle of a stare-down with the one guy he\u2019d been going out of his way to avoid. It was reminiscent of when prey noticed a predator about to pounce on them, and Dabi sure as fuck wasn\u2019t the one in power here.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei was slight and far shorter than him, and most likely not fire proof, but their loose posture spoke volumes\u2014 it didn\u2019t even cross their mind to be cowed as they stared him down from the other end of the alley, his only viable exit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re Dabi, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Ah,</em> he thought intelligently, hoping it didn\u2019t show on his face, <em>I\u2019m fucked.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>34.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Sometime in the near future, Dabi would look back on that first meeting and wonder why he didn\u2019t just use his quirk the moment he noticed the vigilante. It would\u2019ve certainly saved him the trouble of dealing with Y\u016brei\u2019s little group of freaks now, because apparently the guy had a hobby of picking up any and all strays he came across and kind of liked.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi glanced around the building that apparently belonged to Y\u016brei even though the guy was like, eleven. There were people of all ages living here, but Dabi knew for a fact that they were all villains or runaways or outcasts in some way shape or form.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At least he wasn\u2019t the one in charge of keeping them all alive. Silver linings and all that. No, that dubious honor was bestowed upon Mr. Compress and Magne, the poor bastards. They weren\u2019t the <em>only</em> adults in the group, but they were the only two with at least <em>some</em> sense of responsibility and thus they became the designated Adults (with a capital A) in the Haunting\u2014 as Toga had dubbed the group.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi felt sorry for them sometimes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He imagined it couldn\u2019t be easy to mediate between a bunch of enablers, a bunch of adults that acted like children, and a bunch of actual children, all of whom considered the law and general rules of socialization to be no more than a <em>very</em> loose guideline on how they should act.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(And, look, Dabi wasn\u2019t afraid of them, he\u2019d seen too much shit in his life to be scared of little kids, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t infinitely glad he wasn\u2019t the one in charge of dissuading the Toga-Y\u016brei-Mustard trio from some of their wildest plans. Those children were weapons of mass destruction on a good day, and Dabi still wasn\u2019t sure if them being barely middle school aged made it worse or not.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>35.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Tenko caught wind of Izuku\u2019s little side project, he laughed so hard he fell off his bed and <em>still continued</em> <em>wheezing.</em> His twin stared at him with a smile that was equal parts amused and bemused and just barely managed to stay on this side of polite, but Tenko was too busy appreciating the brilliance of the whole situation to care.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tenko wheezed, taking a couple minutes to calm his breathing. Fuck, he hadn\u2019t laughed that hard in <em>years.</em> \u201cYou recruited all the people from the league before the other me could? You stole all his potential allies? <em>For real?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s expression was the personification of innocence, but behind it he was an Evil Genius through and through.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh no, nii-chan,\u201d Izuku\u2019s smile widened ever-so-slightly. \u201cI just gave some people in need a home, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cOh my god\u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>36.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first thing Tenko heard when he stepped into Izuku\u2019s probably-illegally-acquired building was a loud groan followed by Dabi asking <em>\u201canother one?\u201d</em> in a long-suffering tone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By his side, Izuku simply snickered and strolled towards where everyone was gathered. Tenko, who was wearing a simple surgical mask and had his hood up, followed suit as he looked around, keeping his hands in his pockets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku really had gathered everyone from the original League of Villains and some more. He avoided looking at Magne for too long, ignored the thought that there was someone important missing, and instead wondered who the brat in the middle school uniform was. He looked even younger than Toga.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis is Dust,\u201d Izuku introduced when he\u2019d reached the front of the group, resting a hand on Tenko\u2019s shoulder. The smile on his face, barely visible behind the veil, didn\u2019t waver even as Tenko shrugged the hand off. \u201cHe\u2019s my twin brother.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There was a loud <em>CLANK</em> as a spoon fell on the floor. Spinner, the one who had been holding said spoon, had his mouth hanging open as he stared at Izuku. He wasn\u2019t the only one, actually. With the exception of Dabi, who had his head in his hands, everyone else was looking between Tenko and his brother with wide eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the end, it was Dabi\u2019s distraught voice that broke the silence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThere were <em>two</em> of you?!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko had never heard Dabi \u2014the snarky emo dude with the mysterious tragic backstory and zero fucks to give\u2014 sound like that, and he could only blink in confusion <em>(what the ever-loving </em>fuck<em> had his brother been doing to get such a reaction?)</em> while Izuku laughed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell, you know the saying,\u201d Izuku started, sounding way too amused, \u201cAll good things come in pairs, right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All in all, Tenko thought as the room spiraled into chaos and questions and whatnot, this was a far better first impression than the one they\u2019d had in the original timeline.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>37.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m just saying, what better place to meet him than at the USJ? We know he\u2019s going to be there for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko\u2019s frown deepened as he offered Eri an apple slice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut becoming a hero? Why the f\u2014 why would I ever do that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku gave him a look like he didn\u2019t understand what the issue was.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou can always change to another course after the USJ. UA has a coding specialization in the support department that you might like,\u201d he said simply. \u201cOr just drop out of UA completely. It\u2019s not that hard.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He narrowed his eyes at his twin, who only stared at him with a blank expression. There was a story somewhere in there for sure.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Though he had to admit that the support department didn\u2019t sound as terrible as heroics, even if it was most likely heavily hero-oriented by virtue of being a hero school.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBesides, you\u2019d have Eraserhead as your homeroom teacher,\u201d Izuku added, like the manipulating little shit he turned out to be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By his side, Eri motioned for another slice and Tenko obliged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he somewhat relented.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>38.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh, Midoriya, you\u2019re also taking UA\u2019s entrance exam, right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku snapped out of his sleep-deprived haze at his homeroom teacher\u2019s question, looking up from where he had been staring blankly at his notebook since he sat down.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, sensei,\u201d he confirmed, pushing down a yawn.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The class fell into an awkward silence after his simple, matter-of-fact answer. Katsuki was glaring at him from his seat, hands shaking from suppressed anger, which Izuku found weird but not necessarily in a bad way.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ever since the rumors of Izuku getting his third homeroom teacher in a month fired during his first year in middle school had spread like wildfire, all teachers hesitated before being openly quirkist or letting other students get away with bullying when he was around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a stark contrast from his original middle school experience. Probably helped also by the fact that Tenko was willing to and had already thrown hands with any bullies he found around the school on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(And the guy said he wasn\u2019t fit to be a hero.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Of course, Katsuki\u2019s record was still as clean as ever, but after the first warning from a teacher he\u2019d backed off somewhat and only provoked Izuku outside of school and when Tenko wasn\u2019t around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was confident that this Katsuki was a much better person than the Katsuki from the original timeline at his age, even if he still had a long way to go. His childhood friend\u2019s attitude was something he\u2019d promised himself to try to change the moment he realized he was stuck in the past.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Feeling some satisfaction from the realization he\u2019d achieved his goal, Izuku looked back down at the barely legible scribbles on his notebook and proceeded to ignore the odd atmosphere in his class.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>39.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Number One Hero spotted in Musutafu: Sludge villain apprehended by All Might!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words went through Izuku\u2019s head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They went through again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">On the third attempt, he realized exactly what just happened and what it meant for him. <em>It was today,</em> he thought numbly, feeling his grip on the phone tighten without any conscious input.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>It was today.</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cZu-nii?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He blinked out of his head, belatedly noticing that Eri had grabbed his sleeve and was looking at him with wide, worried eyes. Glancing up, he noticed Tenko had stopped typing away and was also staring at him oddly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Making use of two lifetimes worth of practice, Izuku pushed down the dread, relaxed his hands, and wiped any negative emotions out of his face before offering his sister a reassuring smile. He gently patted her hair and met his twin\u2019s gaze evenly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll be a quirkless hero after all,\u201d was all he said, knowing the other would understand.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAh,\u201d Tenko breathed out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eri looked between the two of them with a frown, but Izuku was quick to distract her (and himself too). This wasn\u2019t something she needed to worry about.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>40.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hitoshi stared wide-eyed between the weirdly cheerful guy who\u2019d offered to train him and Dagobah beach, which had been anonymously cleaned out around two years ago.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026that was <em>you?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His voice came out slightly higher than he had intended, but he figured it was justified. The running theory behind the Dagobah beach mystery was that a group, meaning at least <em>ten</em> people, had restored the place to its former beauty in the span of six months a couple years ago, so excuse him for feeling a little doubtful about this random admission.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Midoriya had the gall to laugh too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI needed a way to gain muscle fast,\u201d he said in lieu of an answer. \u201cMoving trash around is a surprisingly effective method, if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hitoshi glanced at the guy\u2019s arms and torso, well-toned muscles noticeable even through the simple shirt he was wearing, and didn\u2019t doubt the efficacy of such method.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnyhow,\u201d Midoriya moved on. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll be training. I\u2019ll meet you here every day after school, alright? We\u2019ll also need to arrange for a diet that will benefit you and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As he listened to the guy ramble on about his plans, Hitoshi couldn\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019d hit the jackpot. With this, he might actually have a chance of getting into UA\u2019s heroic department.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>41.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Tenko started reluctantly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He looked like he\u2019d been forced to swallow a lemon whole, and Izuku silently raised an eyebrow, wondering what was up with him now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026UA\u2019s entrance exam, what kind of level is it gonna be?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s eyes sparkled and a wide grin took place in his face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko\u2019s grim expression worsened, if that was even possible.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>42.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026holy fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko stared with eyes full of disbelief at the robot in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had explained the contents of the exam, as well as the secret rescue points system and how to pass the level for sure, so Tenko knew what to expect and how to react.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And so far, everything had been within his expectations. He found the whole thing to be laughably easy and unnecessary flashy, in general. It only managed to reinforce his opinion that there was something truly wrong with society.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What Izuku had neglected to mention, however, was that the Zero Pointer would actually be fucking <em>massive.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As he carried some injured NPC away from a robot taller than half the fake city\u2019s buildings, there was only one thought running through his mind\u2026 <em>what the actual fuck is wrong with this school?!</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fuck fuck fuck\u2014 with exams like this it was no wonder that those first-year brats survived the League\u2019s attacks time and time again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>43.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Meanwhile in a different testing area, Izuku was sporting a wild, slightly maniacal grin as he swung a steel plate into the \u2018head\u2019 of a robot, with enough strength to break both the plate <em>and</em> the robot below.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ah, it was good to not have to worry about collateral damage for once.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It wasn\u2019t often that he could go all out like this after all. Even in the future, he could only fight without restrains against the Nomu, All For One, and Shigaraki. Normal villains tended to die if he did that, even without the help of One For All.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Izuku made the math and he was eighty-five percent sure he could take his old sixteen-year-old self in a fight any day, and the number went up to ninety-nine if they both fought quirkless.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>44.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All For One crushed down the urge to shoot the messenger with skill borne from decades of practice and instead focused on the problem at hand. Namely, this <em>Y\u016brei</em> character.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Three years. That\u2019s how long this ghost had been around, building a reputation on par with All For One\u2019s in a fourth of the time it took him to do it. It was ridiculously impressive, and All For One would have been amused by it all if Y\u016brei hadn\u2019t also decided to target <em>his</em> organization.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Because Y\u016brei wasn\u2019t just some small obstacle like the many others he\u2019d encountered in the past. No, Y\u016brei was more like a large disaster, if he was being honest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The ghost was <em>efficient.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Exactly three years after he received the first report about the destruction of an entire branch of his organization, All For One was informed that their last remaining Nomu factory in Japan, the one hidden under a hospital, had fallen. He had no idea what had even happened to the Doctor, though he suspected the man had met a fate as unfortunate as the one of that Overhaul character from a while ago.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Two centuries\u2019 worth of meticulous work, the best players in the field working under his orders, unequivocally the greatest quirk research in the entire world\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All of it completely eradicated within three years.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not even All Might had done this much damage to his organization in the thirty plus years he\u2019d been around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2026at least he still had Tomura and his little pet project.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>45.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Shouta ran into Y\u016brei near the end of his patrol, he couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so happy?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The vigilante looked more refreshed than he had ever seen him in all the time they had known each other, so Shouta couldn\u2019t help but feel curious.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei blinked at him, but his demeanor remained unusually cheerful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI just had a lot of fun today, Eraser.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta could hear the grin when he spoke even if he couldn\u2019t see Y\u016brei\u2019s face properly behind the black veil.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026do I even want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei hummed, \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta promptly decided that whatever it was that Y\u016brei was so happy about, it wasn\u2019t worth the headache that it would give him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>46.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHave you got your pocket tissues?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd your handkerchiefs? Have you two got those?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, mother.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe got them, mom. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku heard Eri giggle next to him and he shared an amused glance with her. Then he smiled at their anxious mom before he finished tying his shoes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In front of him, Tenko was already ready and waiting.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIzuku, Tenko!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All three children focused back on their mom. She smiled shakily, eyes shiny with unshed tears.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m proud of you both.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMe too!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku offered his mom a warm smile in return and ruffled his sister\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSee you later, mom, Eri!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBye, mother. Have fun in elementary, chipmunk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI will, Ten-nii!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku chuckled as they left the house, and he had to skip a bit to catch up to his impatient brother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko\u2019s expression had morphed into a scowl the moment they were out of sight, clearly unhappy he had to wear the uniform of a school he\u2019d tried (and mostly failed) to destroy multiple times in the past.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku considered it to be some type of karma and ignored the grumblings of his twin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>47.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The moment he stepped into 1-A\u2019s classroom, Izuku was hit with a wave of nostalgia so strong that he had to consciously stop himself from smiling too wide or bursting into tears. It\u2019d been too long since he last saw all his friends together like this, even if none of them knew him yet.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He ignored Katsuki\u2019s glare with practiced ease, waved at a tired Shinsou, and cheerfully greeted Uraraka when she thanked him for saving her during the exam.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This time he made sure to be in his seat before Aizawa-sensei showed up though, knowing that first impressions were important.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He noticed that Tenko was sat behind him, in the seat that Mineta would\u2019ve occupied if he was here, and he grinned at his brother who he imagined was still grumbling internally. Tenko narrowed his eyes at him but didn\u2019t get to say anything because that was the moment their teacher walked\u2014 well, <em>crawled</em> in.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Somehow, he found his teacher\u2019s aptly nicknamed \u2018caterpillar mode\u2019 to still be as disturbing to look at as he remembered.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>48.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta observed his new class as they went through the tests, mentally keeping track of things he\u2019d have to correct or encourage in the students later on.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Inevitably, his eyes travelled towards the two boys at the back of the group. He could already tell who this year\u2019s Problem Children would be just by looking at them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Midoriya Tenko and Midoriya Izuku.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was rare to have siblings without complementary quirks be placed in the same classroom, and the only reason they\u2019d both ended up in Shouta\u2019s class was because he was better suited to teach someone in their situation than Kan could ever be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That said, the two brothers were excelling in all the tests so far, ranking always within the top five. This alone wasn\u2019t exceptional; Todoroki and Yaoyorozu were also consistently ranking high. No, the remarkable thing was that they were doing so <em>without</em> quirks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Midoriya twins were quirkless so they didn\u2019t have much of a choice in the matter, but the fact that it wasn\u2019t stopping them from consistently ranking high was what caught Shouta\u2019s attention the most.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Most kids didn\u2019t really bother training before they got to UA, and even those who did didn\u2019t do nearly as well as how the twins were doing right now or how they did during the entrance exam.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(The eldest, Midoriya Tenko, had got in mainly through rescue points, only defeating two or three robots at the beginning before giving up on that entirely and choosing to do something more efficient with his energy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The youngest though\u2026 Shouta could still clearly recall the green blur that had obliterated any and all robots that were unfortunate enough to cross his path, always moving in increasingly creative ways and never failing to rescue other participants on the way.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It had been quite a sight, and the silence that filled the observation room once Nezu announced that the kid who had undoubtedly gotten first place was quirkless\u2014 it was something he secretly reveled in.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta watched as Midoriya Izuku grabbed a ball for the ball throw test, got in position, and then proceeded to hurl the object in the complete opposite direction he was meant to. The ball flew directly at Bakugou and, without thinking, the teen exploded it back the direction it came from.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Midoriya Tenko let out a loud cackle as the recording device showed an outstanding 720.2 meters, a whole fifteen meters higher than Bakugou\u2019s own score.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta barely held back a sigh as he moved to stop Bakugou from murdering the green haired boy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Those twins were definitely this year\u2019s Problem Children, he was sure of it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>49.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What had begun as mild discontent when he realized that All Might was going to be his teacher had steadily escalated to the point where it was at now: complete and utter loathing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hadn\u2019t felt this strongly about the guy since he was twenty, for fuck\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko, making use of all the wisdom he\u2019d gained in the past fifteen years he spent practically joined at the hip to Izuku, had reasoned that All Might would have no reason to treat neither of them any differently from the other students.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku wasn\u2019t his successor, so he wouldn\u2019t be favored, and Tenko wasn\u2019t a villain, so he wouldn\u2019t be held in low regard.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ho boy was he wrong.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Who would\u2019ve expected Japan\u2019s number one hero, the great and adored All Might, to be not only a terrible teacher, but a quirkist one at that?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A glance at his twin told him that Izuku had.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A frown formed in his face as he studied his brother. He felt like every time he learned something about Midoriya Izuku\u2019s past, the number of questions he had grew exponentially. How in the world had Izuku inherited One For All if All Might disliked the quirkless this much?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Green eyes abruptly met his just as he felt a hand take his, and Tenko suppressed a flinch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cCalm down.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words were barely loud enough for him to hear but it made him realize that he\u2019d been unconsciously scratching his arm enough to draw blood. Not like anyone would notice, as it mixed with the dried blood already on him from trying to stop his nosebleed during his match earlier.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A match that All Might had put a stop to the moment he saw Tenko\u2019s nose bleeding even though he let Bakugou Katsuki explode the guy with six arms multiple times, and let Endeavor\u2019s brat freeze everyone inside the building despite the threat of frostbite, and let that electric brat electrocute himself, and and and\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTenko.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s even voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he focused on the pair of green eyes in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Tenko had come to know that Izuku\u2019s eyes only looked like this when one of the people he loved got injured or when he was trying to emotionally distance himself from something that pained him. Seeing as everyone here was fine, it had to be the latter.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was in distress right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All Might was hurting his brother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>That bastard\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The hand holding his tightened its grip, and some tiny part of Tenko\u2019s mind that sounded suspiciously like Kurogiri pointed out that it\u2019d leave a bruise later for sure, but for now it was enough to make him focus back on reality.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He took a deep breath and crushed down his chaotic emotions with skill borne from years of practice as both the leader of the League of Villains, Grand Commander of the Paranormal Liberation Front, and Midoriya Inko\u2019s quirkless son. He knew he couldn\u2019t get angry. Not now at least. He could destroy something later, but first he had to get through the school day.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he assured once his mind cleared enough.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His brother studied him for a moment longer before nodding and letting go of his hand. He didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>50.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSo, what\u2019re your quirks, Izuku-kun, Midoriya-kun? Do you have complementary quirks or something?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko subtly looked up at the question that was mostly aimed at Izuku, given he was the one to interact with 1-A the most. The gravity girl, whatever her name was, was the one to ask, but most students nearby \u2014except for that purple-haired brat Izuku was friends with\u2014 were looking at them with curiosity.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had a cheerful smile on his face as he opened his mouth to answer, but a scoff cut him off before he could answer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHa! Deku and that fucker don\u2019t <em>have</em> quirks. They\u2019re just <em>quirkless.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko glared at Bakugou \u2014mostly out of habit at this point, that brat\u2019s voice never got any less annoying\u2014 and was met with defiant red eyes that never seemed to learn.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026quirkless?\u201d one of his classmates echoed in the background.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku stared directly at Bakugou too, refusing to break eye contact despite knowing full well how nervous that made people feel \u2014something Tenko had experienced first-hand far too many times. It was only when the brat shifted uncomfortably, face twisting as if he was about to snarl, that Izuku turned around and smiled at the rest of the class.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, we\u2019re both quirkless,\u201d he confirmed brightly, completely ignoring Bakugou raging next to him. Tenko snorted quietly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had spoken in a friendly tone, but the class still faltered. As the only one who wasn\u2019t confused as fuck from what just happened, Tenko used that moment to study his classmates\u2019 reactions, paying attention to the emotions in their expressions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A while ago, after they got their entrance exams\u2019 results back, he\u2019d asked Izuku a question that\u2019d been nagging at him for a while.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cWhat if your hero friends treat you differently because you don\u2019t have a quirk this time?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku hadn\u2019t replied back then, so Tenko had no other choice than to wait and see to get an answer. And now, that moment had finally come.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou passed the exam <em>without</em> quirks?! That\u2019s so incredible!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI agree, but just <em>how</em> did you do it? I found it hard even with an offensive quirk!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAh! I remember you now!\u201d one of them shouted, the invisible brat. \u201cYou were the boy running around with a piece of metal, right? I think I saw you destroy a couple robots with it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWow, that\u2019s so manly!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko tuned out the rest of the conversation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He would not admit it, but he felt slightly relieved. After having <em>All Might</em> of all people treat them unfairly because of their quirklessness, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly how much it would affect Izuku, but he knew his twin would not be fine if his friends rejected him as well. Not one bit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t know what Izuku\u2019s breaking point was, but unlike his past self, Tenko had no intentions to find out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>51.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko was self-aware enough to know he\u2019d grown a lot through the years, especially after All For One\u2019s capture in the future and after being reborn in the Midoriya family. He <em>knew</em> this, and seeing his debut as a villain from an outsider\u2019s point of view was supposed to put this growth of his into perspective.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That said, nothing could\u2019ve possibly prepared him for the sheer amount of second-hand embarrassment he\u2019d felt the moment the young Shigaraki Tomura stepped through that achingly familiar purple portal, no Nomu in sight because Izuku had systematically destroyed all the factories by now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat was so pathetic,\u201d he muttered, mortified beyond belief. He\u2019d spent more time cringing internally than he did worrying about the sad excuse for villains that showed up or the fact that Kurogiri was right there too. \u201cOh my god, that was so embarrassing, what the fuck. I can\u2019t believe I did that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By his side, Izuku snorted.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s called <em>growth,</em> nii-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko lifted his head from where it was buried in his hands and sent him a look that was meant to be a glare but ended up as just a flat stare.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Fuck,</em> he was never going to live this down now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>52.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There were exactly four weeks between the USJ attack and UA\u2019s Sports Festival, and Izuku had a number of tasks he wanted to get done within that time. An endeavor that would probably be more successful if he stopped adding stuff to the list.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It wasn\u2019t his fault that he kept discovering things that needed to get done as time passed, alright? He didn\u2019t <em>intend</em> to keep making the list larger, it just <em>happened.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dealing with Stain before he ran into Ingenium, finding one or more therapists for the Haunting, arresting Shigaraki Tomura, improving the building where the Haunting stayed, getting rid of All For One, making sure Tenko actually trained for the festival, doing something about Re-Destro and his group, coming up with an opening speech for the festival, finding Gigantomachia and figuring out what the fuck to do with him, speaking with Mei about improving his costumes\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a never-ending list, really.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Eraserhead grumbled as Izuku landed on their usual rooftop, two days after the USJ incident.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not, you\u2019re just early. Should you even be patrolling yet?\u201d he asked, raising a pointed eyebrow. He was fully aware of how far his teacher\u2019s stubbornness went when it came to work, but he had never been able to call him out on it when he was just his student. He was reveling in this newfound power now. \u201cI know you got hurt during the attack at UA the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eraserhead send him a narrowed look, but his overall expression read more like exasperation at his odd omniscience and less like suspicion, so Izuku didn\u2019t think much of it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cChrist, what the hell\u2019s your info network made of? That wasn\u2019t released to the public,\u201d he muttered, then shook his head lightly. \u201cNever mind, I don\u2019t want to know. It was just a broken wrist and a mild concussion\u2014 nothing Recovery Girl couldn\u2019t heal.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOf course,\u201d Izuku said flatly. He still remembered his teacher breaking out of the hospital to teach their class, more bandage than man yet still insisting that he was fine. With a role model like that, it was no wonder Izuku had never managed to curb some of his more\u2026 self-destructive habits. \u201cDid Mic-san even agree with you working so soon or did you sneak out through the window when he wasn\u2019t looking?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eraserhead huffed, somehow managing to look offended despite his expression not changing at all.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIf he didn\u2019t agree, I assure you I would not be here right now,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cHe\u2019d make sure someone else took over my patrol and then tie me to bed or something.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku paused, a retort dying in his throat as the words hit him like a truck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Task delegation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He had a whole group of villains and misfits living rent-free in his building that he could ask to do his tasks for him, how had he not <em>thought</em> of this yet?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He wanted to kick himself so badly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>53.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi watched from afar as Dust walked into their base, feet dragging on the floor, and collapsed on the couch without a single word.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This, of course, prompted Toga and Twice to start poking him to see if he was still alive. Which he proved he was by attempting to shove them away. <em>A</em><em>ttempted</em> being the operative word here.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck off,\u201d Dust mumbled when they didn\u2019t leave him alone, face still buried in a cushion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi almost felt sorry for him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou look terrible,\u201d Twice commented. <em>\u201cTruly a sight to behold.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Toga nodded in agreement, still poking the kid\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, why\u2019re you so bloody, Dust-chan? Ditcha get in a fight or something?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dust groaned, finally sitting up to glare at them, and\u2014 yeah, alright, Dabi had to agree with the other two. Dust looked like he had horribly lost a fight, what with the many bruises and cuts he was sporting wherever his skin was visible. Even his clothes were all fucked up, somehow even more ragged than Dabi\u2019s coat (and that was saying something, he really should get around to replacing it before it fell apart completely).</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If it was a beating, Dabi was sure whoever did it had just become Y\u016brei\u2019s next target. God knows that kid was terrifying when someone hurt what he considered to be his.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was then that, as if summoned by Dabi\u2019s thoughts, the terrifying kid in question walked into their base, looking marginally worse than Dust.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now <em>that,</em> he thought with a pair of raised eyebrows, that\u2019s a rare sight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGod fucking dammit,\u201d was the first thing Y\u016brei said \u2014totally not concerning, coming from the kid who almost never swore\u2014 as he marched angrily towards his twin. Toga and Twice wisely scrambled out of the way, while Dabi watched from the safe distance of being on the other side of the room, morbid curiosity keeping him rooted in place. \u201cYou\u2019re the fucking worst, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei kicked Dust\u2019s arm, ignoring the glare he got in return.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cStop complaining. We got the job done, did we not?\u201d Dust muttered, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei looked like he was contemplating fratricide. It was a feeling Dabi could intimately relate to.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t understand, just how are you so bad at villainy? Considering who mentored you, this is more than a little depressing, Dust. Truly.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dust\u2019s nose scrunched up, making him look mildly constipated. \u201cThe hell are you on about? I\u2019m a great villain.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cShould I remind you of the attack last week? Or any of your many failed attacks in the past?\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThe only plan I\u2019d consider <em>successful</em> on your part was that time you kidnapped Kacchan, and even <em>then,</em> your losses are enough to make me hesitate.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dust visibly cringed, and Dabi couldn\u2019t help but be intrigued. He knew the twins had no qualms mingling with villains, but he hadn\u2019t been aware that they had a past of villainy as well.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As far as he could tell, Dust didn\u2019t really <em>do</em> much in general, preferring to fan the flames of disaster without getting too involved or sticking to causing problems from behind a screen. He seemed to be good at hacking and finding people\u2019s dirty secrets, if Spinner and Y\u016brei\u2019s comments were anything to go by.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei, on the other hand, was still widely considered to be a vigilante-slash-informant in the few, growing circles aware of his existence, despite the many crimes he had most definitely committed in the last couple of years. He even patrolled with a pro hero regularly, for fuck\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut that\u2019s not the problem,\u201d Y\u016brei moved on before Dust could come up with a retort, much to Toga\u2019s obvious disappointment. The Toga-Twice duo looked equally invested in this verbal tennis match while they wisely stuck to the sidelines. \u201cYou almost <em>killed</em> the guy, Dust. That\u2019s <em>bad.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhy\u2019re you acting like it\u2019s such a big deal?\u201d Dust honest-to-god <em>whined,</em> propping himself up on his elbows. \u201cYou said it, I <em>almost </em>killed him\u2014 and don\u2019t act like you haven\u2019t killed before too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, but only when I knew there was nothing that could tie those deaths back to me,\u201d Y\u016brei deadpanned, and Dabi\u2019s brain suddenly decided to remind him that the Shie Hassaikai\u2019s case still hadn\u2019t been resolved even though everyone and their mothers knew who the person responsible for their end was. \u201cHalf the goddamn neighborhood saw us fighting tonight, you unsubtle fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dust didn\u2019t look the least bit sorry, making Dabi wonder if he actually had no sense of self-preservation at all. Y\u016brei pinched the bridge of his nose, visibly frustrated.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cNii-chan,\u201d</em> he started pointedly. \u201cI let you tag along because I knew you had a bone to pick with him from before. It wasn\u2019t so you could slam his head into a brick wall <em>after </em>he passed out.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFucker deserved it anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThe wall <em>cracked.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNot my fault it was a shitty wall.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh, for the love of\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei cut himself off, taking a moment to reign in his clear desire to punch Dust into tomorrow. Dabi had to applaud that show of self-control\u2014 but only mentally, he wouldn\u2019t want to interrupt this little show.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou know what?\u201d Y\u016brei said suddenly, voice deceptively calm. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to deal with your bullshit right now. I\u2019m going to sleep and <em>we</em> will work on damage control when I wake up. You can consider your hacking privileges revoked \u2018til further notice.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They watched blankly as Y\u016brei turned on his heel and walked off to the room he had claimed as his in the building, completely ignoring his brother\u2019s complaints as Dust scrambled to follow.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell that was fun,\u201d Toga giggled once the twins were out of sight, sounding like she couldn\u2019t understand what the fuck just happened.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi could relate.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Two days later, Toga would come running at him and shove her phone into his face. Only after he managed to calm her down enough to actually <em>see</em> what she was showing him would he realize it was a news article about the capture of the Hero Killer; Stain, who apparently had been found in an alley in Hosu, with extensive injuries and his head having been bashed against a wall.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As he stomped down on the urge to laugh hysterically to cover his ever-growing apprehension towards a certain ghost child, Dabi couldn\u2019t help but think that the twins truly were great at damage control.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not a single article even hinted at their involvement.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>54.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku knew, in theory, that the League of Villains was somewhat competent at their jobs. If anything, almost making society as a whole collapse in the previous timeline was a testament to that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Knowing and seeing were two different things though, and he couldn\u2019t help but be mildly surprised when the Haunting all reported back great progress in their assigned tasks with still a week to go \u2018til the festival.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Compress, Spinner, and Himiko, probably the most solid infiltration-and-capture team he could form with these people, had been sent to retrieve and dispose of Re-Destro and anybody working directly with him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku wasn\u2019t familiar with all the high-ranking members of the Meta Liberation Army so he could only go off of Tenko\u2019s memories and whatever information they could find doing some recon for a couple days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the end, the team successfully carried out the mission within two weeks. A week after that, Dabi, Magne, and Tenko announced that they had found Gigantomachia\u2019s current location\u2014 apparently not too far from where Tenko had found him the first time around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Meanwhile, Twice and Mustard he\u2019d sent out on errands to get all kinds of materials\u2014 both for the improvement of their building and for some ideas Izuku had come up with together with Mei.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko was grinning at him, all smug lines and bright eyes, as if he knew exactly what Izuku was thinking and couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of his League. It was actually a very familiar expression, but Izuku didn\u2019t see it often in this timeline, seeing as the League of Villains didn\u2019t exist and their ragtag group was actually Izuku\u2019s work.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He huffed, amused, but let Tenko have his moment.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>55.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It seemed obvious in hindsight, but somehow it hadn\u2019t occurred to Izuku that Tenko might miss his old caretaker until he heard him call for Kurogiri to make him a milkshake while in a sleep-deprived haze.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now that the thought was there, though, it didn\u2019t feel like it was leaving any time soon.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku hadn\u2019t lost much when he was reborn in this timeline. Or rather, he hadn\u2019t lost anything he <em>couldn\u2019t</em> get back eventually if he tried (anything All Might-related was an exception he was pointedly not thinking about). Tenko however\u2026 Everything he\u2019d worked towards, the people he\u2019d got close to in the past\u2014 all of that was <em>lost.</em> And sure, he seemed content with his life now, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean he didn\u2019t miss his old life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku had recruited every future member from the League mainly because he didn\u2019t want Shigaraki Tomura to get to them first and cause problems again, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason. No, he\u2019d done it because while Izuku would get all his friends back when he got into UA, Tenko didn\u2019t have that advantage. Izuku wanted Tenko to have his friends back too without him joining with the League a second time, and so he did what he thought was the best way of achieving that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hadn\u2019t failed to notice how much more relaxed Tenko had become ever since he was re-introduced to the others, either.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Still, there was someone missing from the original League that Izuku hadn\u2019t managed to bring to their side, the one person who was arguably the most important for his brother in the whole group.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A finger tapped his forehead harshly, right between his eyebrows, and he flinched back. When he looked up, he found Tenko raising an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThe freaks said there\u2019s movie night tonight and we\u2019re not allowed to ditch,\u201d he informed flatly, collapsing on the couch next to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku nodded absently, filling the information away in his brain and focusing on studying Tenko instead.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhatcha looking at?\u201d his brother snapped eventually, no real heat behind the words.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDo you miss Kurogiri?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko froze, and\u2014 oh. He hadn\u2019t meant to blurt that. Izuku had planned a more subtle approach, but now that the words were out of his mouth, he decided that forging forward was the only way to go.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI managed to find and bring together all the others from your League but I just realized that Kurogiri was missing, and since he was your main caretaker growing up, I wondered if\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJesus Christ, shut the fuck up.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku\u2019s mouth snapped shut, watching his brother run both hands down his face tiredly. One of them stayed up, scratching his temple slightly in that terrible habit Tenko never seemed to drop. Izuku ignored it for now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cKurogiri\u2019s a Nomu. He was programmed to protect me\u2014 to protect <em>Shigaraki Tomura</em> first and foremost,\u201d Tenko explained tonelessly, a grimace on his face. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to make him join our party like you did with the rest of the freaks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku blinked. This wasn\u2019t anything he didn\u2019t already know from the other timeline. Kurogiri was a Nomu made from the corpse of an old UA student who may or may not have been related to Aizawa-sensei and Yamada-sensei. That he prioritized Shigaraki\u2019s safety, and by extension the League\u2019s, over everything else was also pretty easy to figure out when he analyzed their behaviors.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That said, he hadn\u2019t spent the past four years <em>just</em> tormenting All For One. As fun as that hobby was, Izuku liked being efficient, and while destroying his father\u2019s main assets could be considered enough already, he had taken it one step further and stolen all the information he could get his hands on. Which was, after paying a visit to all Nomu factories he could find in the country, <em>a</em> <em>lot</em> of information.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All this to say that Izuku knew far more about bioengineering and genetics than any one person should.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question though,\u201d he said after a beat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko frowned at him like he was being annoyingly dense, but Izuku just waited. Eventually, his twin sighed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe was a great asset,\u201d he admitted, and knowing how emotionally constipated Tenko was, Izuku would take it for the admission it was meant to be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThen we\u2019ll get him back,\u201d he said simply, shrugging casually and ignoring the startled look he was given. He made a mental note to add it to his written to-do list later. \u201cI would need to take a look at him first, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can reprogram him. I have enough notes on bioengineering and Nomu-making to be able to at least <em>try.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When he didn\u2019t get a response, he turned to find Tenko frozen in place, mouth moving but no sound coming out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2014 it\u2014 <em>what?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Despite the seriousness of the conversation, Izuku couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI had to suddenly learn how to use seven quirks at age sixteen, dude. Do you really think I never delved into bioengineering and genetics to try and make sense of them?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko\u2019s mouth closed with a <em>click</em> as he leaned back on the couch and stared into space, looking like he was reconsidering a lot of things. Izuku let him be, pushing his hand away from his face when the scratching restarted and leaning back comfortably as he started to think up a plan for his new objective, yet another bullet point to be added to his ever-growing list.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He\u2019d get Kurogiri back, for Tenko.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>56.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There were four days left until the day of the Sports Festival, meaning that Shouta was overworked and stressed enough even <em>before </em>he received what was quite possibly the most disconcerting message from Y\u016brei so far.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The vigilante had let him know beforehand not to expect him during patrol that night, saying he had something to take care of and wouldn\u2019t be able to make it in time, so to have suddenly received a text from him with just some coordinates was, to put it mildly, alarming.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Thankfully, Shouta hadn\u2019t been too far away from the location to begin with and thus made it there in just a couple of minutes, landing lightly on top of the closest rooftop.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Whatever he was expecting \u2014maybe a fight? Y\u016brei injured? A powerful villain?\u2014 it certainly wasn\u2019t to see Y\u016brei sitting cross-legged on top of a dumpster, quietly talking with an unknown person, who was in turn leaning against the opposite wall of the alley. They both looked like they\u2019d just been in a fight, small cuts and injuries coupled with tattered dirty clothes, but Shouta didn\u2019t get the impression it\u2019d been against each other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He climbed down, catching the tail end of their conversation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2026have nee-san take care of them later, stop fussing,\u201d grumbled the stranger.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s not fussing\u2014 oh hey Eraser!\u201d Y\u016brei perked up, waving a hand in his direction, and Shouta nodded in greeting, making sure the stranger stayed within his field of vision. \u201cThanks for coming on such short notice.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hummed absently, allowing himself to relax marginally at the lack of immediate action.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhy\u2019d you call me?\u201d he asked finally, and watched as Y\u016brei rubbed the back of his neck, what was visible of his expression reading as slight sheepishness. Shouta resisted the urge to frown. \u201cY\u016brei?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t get mad,\u201d Y\u016brei started, which were the magic words to actually <em>make</em> him frown, because nothing good for his sanity had ever followed them. \u201cHere, just\u2014 see for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei gestured vaguely in the stranger\u2019s direction. More specifically, towards the stranger\u2019s feet, and Shouta squinted at the shadows, wondering what the hell Y\u016brei could be possibly showing him\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He paused.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Was that\u2026 a body?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For one truly surreal moment, he wondered if maybe Y\u016brei had killed someone and wanted help <em>\u2014Shouta\u2019s</em> help at that\u2014 to hide the body, but then he registered the sound of shallow breaths coming from it and discarded the thought.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That still left him with a body though.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd who\u2019s this supposed to be\u2026?\u201d he asked, because what else was there to ask at this point? Clearly Y\u016brei wanted him to do something about them, considering he would\u2019ve just handed them off to the police otherwise, so maybe the question would shed some light as to <em>why.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei blinked, looking thrown off, while the stranger let out a groan, as if suddenly realizing something very obvious, and shuffled away from the body. Not too far, though. Just enough that it\u2019d be more visible under the dim light from a street lamp but still at arms-reach in case it suddenly started moving.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shouta studied it again as the silence stretched on, taking in the bloodied black clothes, separately tied hands, and suspiciously familiar grey hair.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Evidently, Shouta should be able to recognize this person. Y\u016brei seemed to think so, at least.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As if understanding he should probably explain himself, the vigilante awkwardly cleared his throat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s, um\u2026 Eraser, that\u2019s Shigaraki Tomura.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ah, so <em>that\u2019s</em> why Y\u016brei prefaced this conversation with a \u201cdon\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If Shouta went grey young, he was definitely blaming Y\u016brei.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>57.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the three years since Y\u016brei roped him into joining his little odd group, Atsuhiro had more or less grown used to being one of the few people with any common sense around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There was a reason why he and Magne were the designated Adults, after all, and while Y\u016brei seemed to be at least somewhat responsible, the boy also had a chaotic streak a mile wide. The fact that he came up with and successfully executed a plan to adopt a bunch of villains and runaways was as good an example as any.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All this, of course, meant that when Y\u016brei announced his newest course of action and his questionable decision to involve them all in it, Atsuhiro didn\u2019t think much of it beyond mentally preparing himself for the worst.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was only after he looked at the whole picture that he started to wonder if maybe Y\u016brei hadn\u2019t finally snapped under the pressure and gone crazy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou can release him on the table,\u201d Y\u016brei instructed as they walked inside the lab the kid had somehow acquired, not waiting to see if Atsuhiro would follow as he moved towards one of the counters and pulled out a pair of surgical gloves.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Atsuhiro didn\u2019t need to be told twice though. He quickly pulled out the marble containing the unconscious mist-guy Y\u016brei had him kidnap and releasing him. He tried to make his movements as natural and relaxed as physically possible, years of acting coming back easily, but something must\u2019ve tipped Y\u016brei off of his unease with the situation if the mild smile sent his way was any indication.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRelax,\u201d Y\u016brei said, not unkindly. \u201cHis body\u2019s been altered so he\u2019d be an obedient servant with little to no free will. We\u2019re just changing him back to normal.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t question how a fifteen-year-old could possibly know enough about genetic engineering to accomplish that. Regardless of age and in spite of his crazy plans, Y\u016brei was one of the most self-aware people Atsuhiro knew. He wouldn\u2019t carry on with this if he wasn\u2019t confident that he could do it and do it <em>well.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The boy paused for a moment, lips curling in distaste as he eyed the guy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOr well,\u201d he amended mildly, \u201cas close to normal as we can manage, anyhow. Some things are just beyond repair.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Atsuhiro simply nodded, accepting the words as they were intended\u2014 a reassurance, if blunt in its delivery, that they weren\u2019t about to do something unforgivable.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Atsuhiro was a villain, but there were some lines that just weren\u2019t meant to be crossed no matter what, and he trusted Y\u016brei enough to know he wouldn\u2019t lie about this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>58.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHave fun tomorrow, boys!\u201d exclaimed Himiko, waving at the twins as they got ready to leave. \u201cBreak a leg!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dust snorted, \u201cYeah, Y\u016brei\u2014 break a leg.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei sent him a dry look, apparently unamused at whatever memory his brother had referenced. Himiko didn\u2019t dwell on that odd exchange\u2014 the boys had a lot of inside jokes and asking had never got her a real answer before, so she wouldn\u2019t try now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Instead, she simply watched as Y\u016brei sighed and turned to smile at her. \u201cThank you, Himiko-chan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try our best. Just you watch.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Himiko nodded excitedly, \u201cWill do!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By her side, sprawled on the couch, Dabi made a quiet, confused noise. \u201cWhat\u2019s tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThe Sports Festival, duh,\u201d Himiko replied, frowning a little because she <em>knew</em> she\u2019d told him about it\u2014 she even made him promise to watch it with her and the rest of the Haunting! Had Dabi forgotten already?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi\u2019s face scrunched up, either in annoyance or further confusion. Most likely a mix of both. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with \u2018em?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Himiko blinked, unsure of where the confusion stemmed from. She glanced at the twins, but Dust seemed to be in the same predicament as her, while Y\u016brei\u2019s face was doing that thing it did when he knew something the rest of them didn\u2019t and found it amusing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She looked back at Dabi, understanding finally hitting her, and didn\u2019t bother stopping the grin threatening to stretch over her face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201d muttered Dust, apparently coming to the same conclusion as the rest of them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDabi,\u201d Y\u016brei called, voice light with mirth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There was a great deal of apprehension in his muttered \u201c\u2026what?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe\u2019re UA students, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck off,\u201d was Dabi\u2019s reflexive reply, most likely assuming Y\u016brei was pulling his leg. An understandable assumption, all things considered. Himiko giggled.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSeriously. Class 1-A,\u201d insisted Y\u016brei, but Dabi just shook his head, glaring at them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, no, I\u2019m not falling for that,\u201d he declared, pointedly going back to looking at his phone, and Himiko shared a knowing look with the twins.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Y\u016brei shrugged, \u201cAlright then.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(The next day, she made sure to have her camera ready when the twins showed up on TV. The dumbfounded expression on not only Dabi\u2019s face but also everyone else\u2019s was just <em>priceless.)</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>59.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">To say All For One was upset would be the greatest understatement of his life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His Nomu project was all but done for with the destruction of the factories and the presumed death of the Doctor, the destruction rate of his organization kept on growing despite his best efforts, and both Tomura and Kurogiri had been captured and taken somewhere his warp quirk couldn\u2019t reach.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And to top it all off, both of his sons had up and decided to become <em>heroes.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All For One was all for defying society and its rules, especially if it affected the heroic system directly, but did they <em>really</em> have to choose the<em> one</em> career All For One actively fought against?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Did they really have to follow in their uncle\u2019s footsteps?)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If he were a superstitious man, he\u2019d think the universe was actively working to make him miserable. But he wasn\u2019t, so he was blaming Y\u016brei for his troubles. Everything had only gone downhill ever since that goddamn ghost showed up, even the things that they couldn\u2019t have possibly have a hand in.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like his quirkless sons being in UA\u2019s hero course.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Speaking of\u2014 All For One had cleared a day in his schedule to watch the Sports Festival with Tomura long before the boy had gotten caught. The fact that he was missing now didn\u2019t mean All For One\u2019s interest in certain contenders had been smothered.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">So, here he was, sat in front of the TV and watching the first event, an obstacle race, begin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku, his youngest, had given the opening speech to the festival, all bright smiles and friendly personality. A good public speaker, that one. He pondered on the idea of the boy going on to become an advocate for quirkless rights in the future, watching him effortlessly pick up a discarded piece of metal from one of the ridiculously sized robots and\u2026 angling it towards a set of cannons pulled from the flesh of another student. He leapt into the air.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Surely not\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The cannons exploded and Izuku <em>shot</em> through the air on a steel plate, easily carried by the destructive force. All For One watched, breath held, as the boy rocketed over any remaining robots, right over the canyon, and landed solidly\u2026 in the middle of a field of landmines. Which promptly exploded, carrying the boy straight to the finish line with only the occasional foot touching the ground to rocket himself off yet another mine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Both audience and announcers stared, completely dumbstruck, as a quirkless fifteen-year-old rocketed through the obstacle course, finishing the race in thirty seconds flat and no doubt breaking whatever the previous record for this thing was.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFIRST PLACE GOES TO MIDORIYA IZUKU!\u201d Present Mic screamed, a good five seconds later. The cameras focused on the boy, who somehow looked completely nonchalant as he beamed at the audience, before panning back to the other participants.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Thankfully, Tenko had the sense to actually go <em>through</em> the obstacles and reach the finish line in seventh place. Good to know that at least <em>one</em> of his kids had some working self-preservation instincts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Then his youngest was assigned a ten-million-point bounty and merely shrugged, skipping around as he quickly gathered a team consisting of his brother, a girl with pink hair, and another with a gravity quirk, somehow looking completely unbothered about having the entire school out to get him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Then again, </em>a nasty voice whispered in his mind,<em> it probably is the norm since they\u2019re quirkless.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The cavalry battle began and All For One watched the pink haired girl give both of his sons what could only be reinforced metal pipes as they all took off into the air, staying put with the combined work of the girls\u2019 gravity quirk and hover shoes. From there it was a simple strategy of staying out of the other teams\u2019 range and using the pipes to methodically gift concussions to anyone who got too close.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a terrifyingly effective strategy, and by the end, his boys\u2019 team reigned victorious without losing a single headband.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The camera focused on the celebrating faces of the winning team, with Izuku beaming and Tenko looking all smug right in the center of the screen.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All For One eyed the wine bottle in the corner cabinet longingly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>60.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko made the intelligent decision of refusing to go against his brother, meaning he gave up on participating in the third event altogether and instead got to watch as Izuku demolished the competition with the same ease he did corrupted politicians.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He remembered watching this event with All For One the first time around and knew for a fact that Izuku was not struggling at all now, no matter how much he downplayed his strength for appearances\u2019 sake.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Not like Izuku <em>could</em> go all out here, against children with as little training as first year students had.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Poor Shinsou, the only one aside from Tenko who had known Izuku was a powerhouse and absolutely feral way before today, was unfortunate enough to be Izuku\u2019s first victim, being <em>picked up </em>and <em>tossed </em>out of the ring before he could get even a word in. Shinsou stared dazedly at Izuku from the ground and Tenko would bet his whole allowance that the guy was reevaluating all the times they\u2019d sparred together in the past.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko went out of his way to get popcorn for the match against Todoroki, knowing full well the kind of shitshow it was going to be. And boy did Izuku deliver, prolonging the fight just long enough to get Todoroki to explode in a furious blaze. He caught the grin on his brother\u2019s face right before Izuku jumped after Todoroki and couldn\u2019t help but feel some sympathy for what was going to happen next.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fire shot onwards. Izuku ran directly towards it, grabbing a piece of debris from the half-destroyed ring and using it as a shield against the fire, ricocheting the flame off at an upwards angle. Izuku skidded underneath the improvised shield, his body contorting and twisting into a rising kick aimed at Todoroki\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko winced as Izuku\u2019s reinforced shoes connected with Todoroki\u2019s jaw, sending the poor guy flying out of the ring and towards the wall without mercy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The stadium was silent for one blessed moment before it erupted into wild cheers. His phone too was going crazy with Himiko and the others spamming the Haunting\u2019s group chat, but he ignored it for now, deciding to go check on his stupid twin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(No, he was not <em>concerned.</em> He knew full well Izuku was holding his right arm, making a point to keep it angled away from the cameras, only because his compression band and shirt were no more than a tattered mess by now and the hand-shaped scar Shigaraki Tomura gave <em>Y\u016brei</em> a couple years ago was almost revealed for all to see.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He reached the infirmary minutes after his brother, swinging by the lockers to grab Izuku\u2019s spare PE uniform and compression band, and walked in to find said idiot chuckling sheepishly while Recovery Girl bandaged him up, scolding the shit out of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTenko!\u201d Izuku exclaimed the moment he made his presence known, looking at him like he was the best thing to happen to him at that moment. To be fair, if Tenko was in his position and someone walked in to possibly distract Recovery Girl, he might just look at them like that too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Still, he scowled, throwing the clothes at Izuku and hitting him square in the face because both his hands were in Recovery Girl\u2019s grasp at the moment.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHey! What\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYour spare uniform, dumbass.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku blinked, then lighted up, grinning at Tenko, \u201cSo you really <em>do</em> care \u2018bout me! Thanks, nii-chan!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMore like I don\u2019t want to see a fifteen-year-old going around naked on live television,\u201d he muttered with a frown. \u201cWhich reminds me\u2014 have you talked to Crazy Two about the NPC\u2019s costumes yet?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, I mentioned it to her,\u201d he nodded, throwing on a shirt the moment he was allowed. \u201cMei-chan took one look at them and immediately started researching a fabric that possibly works with Yaomomo\u2019s and Hagakure\u2019s quirks. Last I heard, she\u2019d thrown a twenty-page essay on why they should change the designs and a portfolio with her ideas on top of Power Loader\u2019s desk and refused to back down until he allowed her to re-work the costumes. If everything goes right, they should be done by the time of our first internships.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGood,\u201d Tenko nodded solemnly. The hero costumes of half the students in his class were so badly made that he cringed every time they were worn, but Tenko could barely look in the girls\u2019 direction during those classes without feeling <em>absolutely disgusted.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All of the girls\u2019 costumes were a problem \u2014Tenko had heard both the gravity girl and Tsu say how uncomfortable they were with how tight theirs were made\u2014 but the class rep\u2019s and the invisible brat\u2019s were the worst of the bunch, what with one of them being <em>far too revealing for a literal teenager</em> and the other <em>straight-up</em> <em>nonexistent.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He already had plans to dig up dirt on the companies that made them and the specific people who authorized their use for literal children. It\u2019d serve to blow off some steam if nothing else.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Recovery Girl shot them a curious look but didn\u2019t ask any questions, moving instead to treat a battered-up Todoroki, still unconscious on the next bed over. Tenko stared at the poor fucker for a moment longer before turning towards his brother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIf you lose against fucking <em>Bakugou</em> of all people, I\u2019m burning all your posters, you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku laughed, \u201cLoud and clear, nii-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(Izuku did not lose against Bakugou. In fact, it was a nearly instant, extremely satisfying K.O. on his part because while Izuku was not willing to fight a <em>kid</em> when he himself had years of experience as both being a pro and working with others, a hero student in a school-sanctioned event was an entirely different matter.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>61.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The night of the Sports Festival, after everything was over and the students were bandaged up and sent home, a celebration was held at the Midoriya household.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their mom made enough food to feed a small army, making sure their favorites were among the various dishes, and Eri excitedly reenacted her favorite moments to her brothers. Tenko applauded and told Eri tidbits of info about the people that had caught her attention, while Izuku and his mom tried to decide the best place to display his gold medal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Afterwards, once Eri had fallen asleep and everything was put away, the boys decided to go to the Haunting. They hadn\u2019t finished closing the door before Himiko threw herself at them, Tenko sidestepping on reflex and Izuku readily catching her. Himiko giggled, gushing about how cool she thought they had been and how she\u2019d recorded everyone\u2019s reactions to show them later.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They let her drag them towards the improvised party everyone had decided to throw for them, both of them relishing the warm atmosphere.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>62.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cVery impressive, Midoriya-kun.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Admirably, Izuku didn\u2019t jump out of his skin when an unexpected voice suddenly sounded as he finished climbing a roof. Even more admirably, he didn\u2019t curse aloud when the words actually registered in his brain.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Slowly, a little reluctant and already dreading the next few minutes, he looked up at owner of the voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI must say,\u201d Nezu said conversationally, like he hadn\u2019t just caught Izuku leaving a crime scene. \u201cYou\u2019re a not an easy individual to get a hold of, much less find any information on. You\u2019ve done a masterful job separating your life as Y\u016brei from your civilian one.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThank you?\u201d he replied, because what else was he supposed to do? Even if he managed to get away now, Nezu ran his <em>school.</em> This conversation was inevitable no matter how much he wished it wasn\u2019t and he\u2019d rather not annoy the one guy who could ruin his life with just a word.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd you managed to do it at only thirteen years of age too,\u201d Nezu continued, walking closer, and Izuku stepped away from the edge of the roof. \u201cYou\u2019re an extremely skilled individual, and it\u2019s become clear that your current curriculum will not be teaching you anything you don\u2019t already know.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSir?\u201d he questioned.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nezu grinned and Izuku felt a sudden sense of <em>foreboding.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHow would you feel about being my personal student, Midoriya-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>63.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko hadn\u2019t known what to expect when he and his brother were called to the principal\u2019s office first thing once classes restarted.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As a general rule, nothing good ever came from these kinds of visits, which meant Tenko had mentally prepared for the worst. He wasn\u2019t sure what the worst could <em>be</em> but he could at least be prepared for it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Witnessing Izuku and Nezu discuss internship options and a new curriculum at length was not something he would\u2019ve ever considered an option to begin with. Apparently, Izuku had forgotten to tell him that the principal knew about Y\u016brei and Dust.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He was going to <em>strangle</em> him for that later.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now though, he simply focused on his frankly amazing tea while he waited for a lull in the conversation. It was starting to get a little hard to follow the longer in went on, and Tenko would rather not be here when it inevitably started going over his head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSir,\u201d he interjected finally, settling down his empty cup. \u201cSince we\u2019re talking about curriculums, I\u2019d like to request something?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nezu hummed, gesturing encouragingly with a paw. He glanced at Izuku momentarily before focusing back on the principal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI would like to transfer to the support department,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh?\u201d Nezu replied, somehow giving the impression that he\u2019d be raising his eyebrow if he had any. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m interested in their coding and IT classes,\u201d he explained, then waved a hand in his brother\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd heroics has always been Izuku\u2019s dream anyway, not mine. I just followed him here because he asked me to and I didn\u2019t have any better plans at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nezu looked thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be interested in a joint curriculum then? Attend classes from both support and heroics?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTo be frank, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be very happy as a hero, sir,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019d rather transfer fully to support, if possible.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Finally, Nezu nodded. He placed both paws on his desk, humming lightly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll fill out the paperwork for your transfer, Midoriya-kun,\u201d he said, and Tenko tried not to show the relief at never having to attend another class taught by All Might. He\u2019s not sure he managed, considering the amused look Izuku shot him. \u201cThe school will send you your new schedule once it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>64.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko had barely finished introducing himself to his new class when Crazy Two, Izuku\u2019s friend who made his vigilante costume and teamed up with them for the Sports Festival, practically shot out of her seat in her effort to catch his attention.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIzu-kun\u2019s brother!\u201d she exclaimed, despite the fact he\u2019d just said his name. \u201cHere! Come sit with me!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko blinked, abruptly remembering why he\u2019d nicknamed her Crazy Two, and turned to look at his homeroom teacher with a raised eyebrow. One heavy sigh later, the man motioned him to go on and get seated.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat\u2019s your specialty?\u201d she demanded once he was close enough, not even waiting for him to sit down first.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cCoding. Hacking.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Crazy Two shot him a wild, slightly maniacal grin as she practically started vibrating on her seat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the physical parts, you make sure the virtual stuff works properly, whaddaya say?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Despite the overenthusiastic and low-key overbearing attitude, Tenko found himself grinning in response.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>65.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Kurogiri had woken up about a week after the Sports Festival, amnesiac but officially capable of free will, and after a check-up to make sure everything was in order, Izuku had put Compress in charge of showing him around the base and introducing him to the Haunting.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Last he checked, Compress, Spinner, and Dabi had been taking turns keeping an eye on Kurogiri, which would probably explain why he walked in on Dabi napping without a care in the world while Kurogiri attempted to gather resources in Minecraft (a mighty effort, because apparently controlling the mist wasn\u2019t as intuitive a task as they had first thought) alongside Tenko.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko, who had been a scratching mess for the last couple of days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko, who had been distracted and anxious the past couple days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko, who now looked calmer and more relaxed than Izuku had ever seen him in this life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Sure, it wasn\u2019t like what they had in the past, back when Tenko was Shigaraki Tomura and Kurogiri was his main caretaker, but it was <em>something.</em> Tenko had happily been helping Kurogiri get used to life again for the past couple days, and Izuku could already see the improvement in his overall mood. It was as if something in Tenko that had been missing for years was finally found now that Kurogiri was here.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A fond smile grew on his face as he watched Tenko go on a short rant about dark oak being leagues better than normal oak and Kurogiri hum, pondering which would go better with cobblestone for their base.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku shook his head and retreated with silent steps out of the room, smiling widely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>66.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Using Kurogiri\u2019s portal to drop on top of All For One might have been a bit of a power move, but it gave him the perfect opportunity to whack the villain over the head with a metal pole before he could react, and it had the added bonus of being an extremely satisfying action.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All For One might have been a two-century-old all-powerful supervillain, but no one was immune to some good ol\u2019 head trauma.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku landed lightly on his feet a decent distance away and watched as Tenko fell from another portal and proceeded to swing a metal baseball bat at All For One\u2019s head too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was a testament to the villain\u2019s resilience and quick thinking that he didn\u2019t immediately pass out. Most people wouldn\u2019t survive the first hit from Izuku, much less the second, so clearly All For One had managed to activated some quirk before the pole made contact.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko huffed as he landed next to him, eyeing the dazed villain on the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHow the hell is he still awake?\u201d he questioned, frowning.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAn incredible reaction-time?\u201d Izuku guessed, carefully stepping closer to kick All For One on the head when he tried to get up. Admittedly, that was for his own satisfaction. He could\u2019ve very well used the metal pole again. \u201cCan\u2019t say he\u2019ll be able to use his quirks anytime soon though. Non-mutation quirks require a lot more brain power than he currently can give.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe has mutation quirks,\u201d Tenko reminded, scratching his neck anxiously. Izuku studied him for another moment before he turned back to the supervillain in the room.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They should finish this quickly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Crouching down next to him, he asked, \u201cAny last words?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If All For One had eyes, Izuku was sure he\u2019d be glaring. With no small amount of effort, the villain said, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 that ghost.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYup,\u201d he confirmed, popping the \u2018p\u2019. Blinking, he squinted at the part of his face that wasn\u2019t scar tissue. \u201cHuh, mom was right, you <em>do </em>have freckles. Fancy that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By virtue of being literally next to the guy, Izuku got a full view of All For One\u2019s expression when it morphed into one of realization and he froze.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell,\u201d All For One said after a beat. \u201cI can\u2019t say I expected\u2026 you. Either of you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe like to break expectations,\u201d Izuku snorted. The sound of scratching intensified behind him and he sighed silently, getting to his feet in one swift motion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Right, he thought as he lifted the metal pole in the air. Time to finish the Beat the Deadbeat Dad plan.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>67.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRemind me again why we can\u2019t just kill him?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku sighed, a tired thing that revealed exactly how done he was with this situation, and waved vaguely in their mountain-shaped problem\u2019s direction. Gigantomachia, sitting cross-legged on the floor and curled up so his head wouldn\u2019t hit the ceiling, seemed unexpectedly enthralled by Twice\u2019s rambling.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For some reason, Toga had made it her mission to paint Gigantomachia\u2019s nails a bright pink color as some sort of Welcome-to-the-Haunting event, while Spinner appeared to be questioning if he was brave enough to follow Mustard\u2019s lead in his attempts to climb the giant\u2019s back. The Adults (now with Kurogiri as an added force) were keeping an eye out in case anything happened but otherwise were just hanging around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dabi had taken exactly one step into the room, made eye contact with Gigantomachia, and promptly walked out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko dearly wished he could do the same.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIf you have a way to kill <em>that</em> with one hit, I would honestly love to hear it,\u201d Izuku deadpanned. \u201cCause if <em>he</em> survives and gets angry, <em>we</em> won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe should\u2019ve just left him in the mountains,\u201d Tenko muttered. \u201cSave us the trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe would\u2019ve found out about All For One\u2019s death and gone on a rampage eventually,\u201d Izuku argued. \u201cBelieve it or not, this <em>is</em> the better outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">On cue, Gigantomachia looked up at them with a wide grin and bright eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cLittle Masters!\u201d he exclaimed, stilling his hands when Toga made a disapproving noise. Why the giant killer mountain had decided to call them <em>Little Masters </em>was beyond Tenko. He didn\u2019t remember Gigantomachia calling him that when he was Tomura\u2014 he had always been just <em>Master\u2019s Successor.</em> \u201cLittle Masters, don\u2019t you want to come listen to the story too? It\u2019s fun!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe\u2019re good, Giga!\u201d Izuku called back, shooting him the same smile Tenko often saw parents give their kids in the park when they wanted the little ones to leave them alone for five minutes but couldn\u2019t exactly say that. \u201cYou keep enjoying yourself, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, Little Master!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFucking hell,\u201d Tenko whispered. \u201cGiga? Really? The fuck did you give \u2018im a nickname for?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGigantomachia is too long. Gets tiring after a while.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The implication that they\u2019d be stuck with this mountain-sized puppy for an unspecified amount of time was almost enough to make him groan. Almost. He settled for scratching his arm instead, because accidentally catching Gigantomachia\u2019s attention with a loud noise was the last thing he needed right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>68.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku stared at the empty whiteboard in front of him, marker in hand and a frown on his face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He <em>could</em> just write Deku again and be done with it. It had worked just fine for him the last time; it shouldn\u2019t be any different now. Deku had been a fine hero, strong and capable and one of the main fighters in the war against Shigaraki Tomura.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He wasn\u2019t Deku anymore. Hadn\u2019t been in a long time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Deku was One For All\u2019s ninth holder; the reckless kid who impressed the number one hero with his selflessness; the boy who made it into UA\u2019s hero course despite all odds.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The hero who could do it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Deku was All Might\u2019s successor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was not.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was Tenko\u2019s twin and Eri\u2019s older brother and the founder of the Haunting. He was the one who got an unlikely second chance at life, someone willing to put the lives of others over the law, someone who All Might looked at with pity rather than pride.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was the one who made it into UA\u2019s hero course and got first place in the entrance exam and later on at the Sports Festival too. The one who achieved all that <em>without a quirk.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku was quirkless but he was <em>alive.</em> Deku died during a war he had been too young to be fighting, killed by an archnemesis who should\u2019ve never been.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shigaraki Tomura and Deku had been victims in a fight that should have never involved them. Both of their fates had been sealed the moment they were chosen, Shigaraki by All For One and Deku by All Might.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">(He never resented All Might for giving him One For All, not when the man couldn\u2019t have known that All For One was alive still, not when it gave him the chance to be the hero he had always dreamed of being.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But, sometimes, when his aching bones wouldn\u2019t let him sleep and the memories weighted heavy on his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the quirk was really necessary. If all the pain and the scars and the deaths had been worth the legacy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He still didn\u2019t have an answer for that.)</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Both Tomura and Deku were given hope by the wrong people and that alone had led to their deaths. But Izuku (jaded, tired, <em>quirkless</em> Izuku) was the one who ended the fight and survived.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Deku was always meant to die a hero, fighting in the front lines so other people wouldn\u2019t, sacrificing his heart, body, and soul for the chance to save just one more person. From the very beginning, when he desperately threw a notebook at a villain so his childhood friend would get one more breath, Deku\u2019s survival was never a priority.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Deku died a hero, but Izuku planned to <em>live.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For his friends, for his family\u2014 for the mother who supported them despite her fear of losing them and the sister who was slowly healing from her trauma and the brother he never had before but had unexpectedly grown to love.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For himself, who was finally starting to realize how loved he was by all these people in his life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku would make sure he <em>lived.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mind made up, he took the cap off the marker and started writing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>69.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe chose our hero names today,\u201d Izuku said, apropos of nothing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko paused in his endeavor to translate Crazy Two\u2019s ideas into a sketch they could actually work with and stared at him, eyebrow raised.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou better not have chosen Deku again or I swear to god, I\u2019m burning all your All Might posters for real,\u201d he said, then muttered, \u201cFuck knows I\u2019m long overdue on that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku snorted, shaking his head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNah. I\u2019ve decided to take a page from your book and put my old name to rest,\u201d he assured, waving a hand airily. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since either of us were \u2018Deku\u2019 or \u2018Shigaraki Tomura\u2019 anyhow. It just didn\u2019t feel right to keep the name, so I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHuh,\u201d Tenko said, for lack of a better response. Izuku was right, though Tenko hadn\u2019t expected him to just go and say it. It felt like one of those things they silently acknowledged but ultimately never voiced\u2014 like their feelings about All For One\u2019s death or the war. \u201cWell? Gonna keep me in suspense or what?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A cheeky grin was sent his way.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSpes: The Perseverant Hero,\u201d he announced. Tenko blinked, wondering whether he should know if that name meant something or not, but was saved from asking when Izuku elaborated. \u201cY\u2019know how Elpis is the Greek goddess of hope? Well, Spes is her Roman equivalent. I want to give hope to all those kids out there that have no quirks or weak quirks, show them that anyone can be a hero regardless of genetics. I know <em>I</em> would\u2019ve loved to be told that as a child.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko hummed appreciatively. It wasn\u2019t a bad name, and disregarding his own opinion when it came to heroes, Izuku had always been good at the whole motivation deal, at giving his allies hope \u2014in both this and their past lives.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He didn\u2019t think Izuku fully understood how much he affected everyone around him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t you work underground though?\u201d he questioned. \u201cThey don\u2019t exactly have enough fame or media exposure to inspire anyone, and daylight heroics would put you at a huge disadvantage.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Izuku nodded, \u201cI thought about that, which is why I\u2019ve decided to become a twilight hero\u2014 like Midnight! Or Sir Nighteye! They have enough PR stunts to be known by the general public and be invited to interviews, but their actual work is closer to that of an underground hero.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAh, a middle level.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYep!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tenko rolled his eyes at the clear enthusiasm and focused back on his work.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou gonna retire Y\u016brei then?\u201d he concluded logically. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine keeping two whole secret identities would go over very well, especially with how demanding time and health wise both are.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Izuku started, tone sheepish. \u201cY\u016brei has a freedom and reach that I wouldn\u2019t get as just Spes, y\u2019know? Like, a pro hero can\u2019t just waltz in and accomplish some of the stuff <em>Y\u016brei</em> does\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The look Tenko levelled him with was utterly unimpressed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd when, exactly, will you have time to sleep then?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll make it work,\u201d Izuku replied, a little too quick.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m above getting mother and Eri on your case if you don\u2019t sleep, Midoriya Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A gasp, narrowed green eyes. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cPlease,\u201d Tenko snorted, a grin widening on his face. \u201cDid you forget I\u2019m a villain? I would most certainly dare.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>"
