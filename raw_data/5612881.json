  "text": "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>He waits, pen at the ready, but the only answer is a sort of shuddering gasp. Yoongi glances up at the boy. He\u2019s probably younger by a few years, and really fucking pretty. Dark hair, dark huge eyes staring like he can\u2019t believe Yoongi is real. He represses a sigh. Yoongi always has trouble with the ones so starry eyed they forget how talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, what\u2019s your\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d his voice is soft, barely above a whisper as he stretches out his hand. Yoongi tenses, thinking he\u2019s about to grab him, sees security starting to move in the corner of his eye, curses inwardly because it\u2019s always the cute ones\u2014but then he sees what the boy is trying to show him. In deep black cursive, the words <em>What\u2019s your name</em> curve around the tender skin of his underarm like a bracelet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, I think you might be my soulmate,\u201d the boy stutters. And Yoongi is about to laugh because that\u2019s ridiculous, that\u2019s utterly preposterous. There must be a billion people out there with those exact words on their arm, and even then it\u2019s so obviously planned, like this isn't what he says to every single fan coming here, what the fuck, and how will he explain Yoongi\u2019s own bare wrist? Except\u2014</p>\n<p>Except the guy\u2019s eyes widen even more, trained on something on the table. A sudden strange sensation traces across Yoongi\u2019s skin. And he looks down at his arm that lies palm up against the table, at the words <em>I think you might be my soulmate</em> in the process of spelling themselves out across his arm in stark contrast and, well. <em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so busy staring at the script that is just doing the finishing touches of his tattoo that he doesn\u2019t notice that the activity around the table has dulled. Namjoon nudges him from his chair to Yoongi\u2019s left, and gives him a questioning glance that Yoongi only manages to return blankly. Activity in the room has stilled, people in the back craning their heads to see why the line has stopped moving forward. There\u2019s a fan in front of Namjoon waiting for her stoplight red converse highs to be signed. And the boy, who is, apparently, Yoongi\u2019s fucking <em>soulmate</em>, just keeps standing there. And they\u2019re all looking at him. Namjoon\u2019s eyes travel to Yoongi\u2019s wrist displayed for all to see, his wrist that should be blank but <em>isn\u2019t</em>, and blanches. \u201cOh shit,\u201d he says under his breath, in English. \u201c<em>Shit</em>, hyung.\u201d Yoongi privately agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d the boy begins, but Yoongi never gets to hear what he\u2019s about to say because as the boy reaches for his wrist like he means to touch it, several things happen at once. Security swoops in and grabs hold of the boy, the room explodes with confused noise and Yoongi finally jerks his arm out of reach, down into his lap. The entire time the boy is being escorted out, his eyes are silently boring into Yoongi\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Luckily the signing is almost over, and the rest is like a haze. Namjoon is shooting him worried glances and Yoongi smiles reassuringly on autopilot, signing and moving on to the next person mechanically. He keeps his arm tucked safely underneath the table the entire time, and tries not to think about the words there burning into his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi curls up against the window of the van. He feels suddenly exhausted, like the marrow has been sucked out of his bones and left him several pounds lighter. Like he might float away if not tethered to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d Namjoon exclaims. \u201cWhat the hell happened in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think?\u201d Yoongi growls back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your soulmate?\u201d Namjoon asks, and just the words are like a freefall. Yoongi says nothing. He doesn\u2019t need to. Namjoon drags his hand down his face like he\u2019s trying to wipe his expression off.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, hyung. I know you don\u2019t want to deal with this but people in there saw, and they\u2019re gonna talk. The director won\u2019t let this slide.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s right, of course. As soon as they get back, it\u2019s damage control.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many of the fans noticed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure, but probably only those at the very front? There was a lot of confusion though, so I\u2019m not sure they understood what was actually happening?\u201d It\u2019s Namjoon that\u2019s answering. Yoongi is staring at his hands on the table. Both his sleeves are pulled down to his knuckles, the edges clutched in his fists.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhotos?\u201d the director questions sharply. Namjoon shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone was close enough to catch it.\u201d The director lets out a sigh, but nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. Without tangible proof we can play this as nothing more than a fan getting a bit too up close and personal. Regardless, it\u2019ll be all over the net.\u201d He places his phone screen up on the table. The tweets are already pouring in. Yoongi bows his head further as the director turns to him. \u201cAnd we need to find that guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook stumbles over his feet as he\u2019s pushed outside, and behind him the door is shut tightly. He sits down on a bench near the entrance, trying to clear up the haze he\u2019s looking through. Min Suga is his soulmate. <em>The</em> Min Suga, rapper extraordinaire, part of famous rap duo <em>Cypher</em>, and the bane of Jungkook\u2019s fanboy existence.</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares down at his arm. The words there should be evidence enough that this <em>isn't</em> one of those dreams Jimin teases him about which he\u2019ll deny having until the end of time. He still pinches himself just to be sure. It leaves a stinging red mark right next to the tattoo.</p>\n<p>His phone is blowing up in his pocket. He wrestles it out of his jeans, and sure enough there is a bunch of texts from Jimin. The last one reads <em>holy s h it wtf happened??????</em> so he guesses Jimin witnessed at least some of all\u2026 that. Once again he thinks, <em>Min Suga is my soulmate</em>, and is hit with a rush like carbonated soda streaming through his veins. His cell vibrates in his palm with an incoming call.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d Then there\u2019s some crackling and Taehyung\u2019s deeper register filters through the speaker. \u201cKookie! Where did the scary men take you? Are you being arrested? Is this your one phone call? Don\u2019t worry, me and Jiminnie won\u2019t let you go to prison alone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook has long since learned to filter which parts of Taehyung\u2019s many questions that require actual answering. \u201cI\u2019m outside, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>A minute later they burst through the doors, Jimin first and Taehyung hot on his heels. Upon spotting him sitting alone on the bench, looking unharmed and not destined for prison any time soon, they deflate. Jimin puts his head in his palm and mutters something sounding suspiciously like \u201cThis kid!\u201d while Taehyung launches himself at Jungkook with a cry of \u201cKookie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. What happened in there? I swear, we look away for one minute and you get hauled off by security\u2026\u201d Jimin glances uncertainly at him. \u201cI know you think Suga-hyung lit the sun and like, invented ramyun flavouring, but you didn\u2019t\u2026 do anything weird to him, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jungkook bursts out.</p>\n<p>Jimin immediately puts up his hands in a placating gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you did, just making sure! What was it then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook has no idea how to explain this in a way that doesn\u2019t sound delusional, so he wordlessly offers his wrist. Jimin gasps like this is some kind of MBC drama (although some hysterical part of Jungkook wonders if they haven\u2019t crossed into that territory already) and grabs his wrist. Taehyung makes a soft sound of surprise from where he draped himself over Jungkook\u2019s back. \u201cYou met your soulmate? Who is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s. Uh.\u201d Jungkook clears his throat. \u201cSuga-hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin drops his arm and snaps his gaze up from where he\u2019d been staring at the tattoo to meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. Taehyung is next to grab Jungkook\u2019s wrist. He traces a light finger over the words, and Jungkook shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d Jimin says, weighing the words carefully in his mouth. \u201cAre you being funny right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook scowls in response. \u201cWould I joke about this? He asked for my name and this,\u201d he gives his wrist a little shake in Taehyung\u2019s loose grip, \u201cappeared on my arm!\u201d</p>\n<p>What follows is a lot of <em>oh my god</em>\u2019s and squeezing from Taehyung, while Jimin looks like he can\u2019t believe this is real life. Granted, Jungkook isn\u2019t sure he can believe it either, but there\u2019s a smile slowly growing on his face that he can\u2019t fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay but,\u201d Jimin suddenly stops jumping up and down, and wrinkles his nose. \u201cWhy did you get escorted out by security then? And why didn\u2019t Suga-hyung say anything about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>His words put a stop to the elation that has been slowly seeping into Jungkook\u2019s heart and settling in his bones. Because thinking back past the <em>holy shit Min Suga is my soulmate</em>, the soulmate in question said nothing at all after the words that sealed their fates.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs to take care of his image, Kookie,\u201d Taehyung says in his ear. He leans his cheek against Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot making a scene meant protecting you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods, but the smile has slipped off his face and he can\u2019t seem to bring it back. Unbidden, the expression on Suga\u2019s face comes back to him. And he realizes that he never answered the only thing his soulmate had asked. He never gave him his name. And now, the person he\u2019s meant to be with has no idea who he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says and her eyes are bright and full of sharp things. He wants to reach out and touch her, but her gaze makes it impossible. \u201cYou were nothing like I thought. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d she stops, biting the inside of her cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d she says and she looks at him like he\u2019s a stranger, someone she\u2019s never seen before. \u201cIt\u2019s not you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her disappointment is like a tangible thing, a weight, crushing over his lungs. She starts walking away and he tries to open his mouth to say something, anything, but the weight presses harder and he can\u2019t get out a single sound even though he tries desperately, anything for her to turn around and look at him again, anything, but he can\u2019t even draw a breath, he can\u2019t <em>breathe</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>And he wakes up coughing, shuddering and gasping for air, greedily sucking it into his lungs and trying to calm his racing heart. He kicks off the blankets, sitting up and scrubbing a hand over his eyes. Christ.</p>\n<p>He jumps when his phone starts buzzing on the bedside table. Drawing yet another deep breath, he swipes at the screen and answers without looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d His voice is rusty with sleep, and he winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi?\u201d It\u2019s Seokjin. \u201cAre you okay? You don\u2019t sound so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh no, \u2018s nothing. Just woke up, is all.\u201d He drags his free hand through his hair, feeling it stick up in sweaty tufts. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brief silence on the other end, then \u201cWe, uh. We found him.\u201d Ridiculously, it actually takes a few seconds for Yoongi to place what he\u2019s talking about. When he does, it\u2019s a better wake up call than being plunged into a tub full of icy water.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Seokjin says. \u201cListen, Yoongi\u2026 I won\u2019t force you to talk to him but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I should meet him,\u201d Yoongi bites out, sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Seokjin\u2019s reply is without hesitation. \u201cYou will need to sooner or later anyway, and I think it could be\u2026 good for you,\u201d he finishes softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d Yoongi begins. \u201cBut are you joking right now, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin just plows on, like he hasn\u2019t heard. \u201cI know you think it\u2019s a bad idea after\u2026 after what happened last time, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the same, Yoongi. Every fan isn\u2019t her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Yoongi grits out, gripping the phone until his fingers turn white. \u201cPlease hang up the phone now.\u201d <em>Before I say something I'll regret</em>, is the unvoiced continuation, and Yoongi knows Seokjin can hear it too by the way he sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says and his voice is so careful and compassionate, like Yoongi is a child that needs calming. \u201cBut think about it, okay? Happiness isn\u2019t only for other people, Yoongi. You are allowed to be happy too.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a click and silence. Yoongi lowers the phone, lets it slide out of his hand and drop into the sheets. The morning light filtering through the curtains is unforgiving.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d he tells the empty room. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, enough. Jeon Jungkook, <em>get up</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pillow hits him in the head. It\u2019s the third one so the element of surprise has worn off by now, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t even grace Jimin with a response. There\u2019s a brief silence, then he can hear Jimin muttering \u201cI can\u2019t believe you're making me do this\u201d just before all the blankets are ripped off him. He squints feebly at the light, curling up on the mattress.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo \u2018way, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until you stop being a mopey teenager and talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut up your Iron Man boxers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits up abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, you haven\u2019t gone to classes in two days! You\u2019ve barely left your bed! You\u2019re only giving one word answers to texts, if any at all, and I know Taehyung insists being tsundere is your <em>thing</em> or whatever, but this is too much even for you. It\u2019s obviously bothering you, so just let it all out.\u201d Jimin\u2019s arms are crossed over his chest, a stern set to his mouth that means business. Jungkook regards him silently, before slumping with his back against the wall. Jimin takes this as an invitation to crawl onto the mattress and settle in next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, now tell hyung what\u2019s wrong.\u201d Jungkook glares half-heartedly at Jimin\u2019s innocent batting of eyelashes, before sighing and biting his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuga-hyung?\u201d Jimin ventures when it becomes clear that Jungkook can\u2019t continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook looks down at his hands twisting the blanket in his lap.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, before meeting Suga, thinking about him was painful because Jungkook admired Suga so much, liked him so much\u2026 and yet Suga had no idea he even existed. Wouldn\u2019t know him if they passed each other on the street, wouldn't even react. Jungkook hated the fact that Suga meant so much to him, but Jungkook himself meant nothing to his idol. Those thoughts were few and far in between though. But now it\u2019s like that, only a hundred times worse. Now Jungkook <em>knows</em> he is meant to be with Suga, he is meant to receive Suga\u2019s affection\u2014except <em>Suga still doesn\u2019t know who he is</em>. Because Jungkook was too much of an idiot, too starstruck to give his fucking name even when <em>asked for it</em>.</p>\n<p>It's like the tattoo adorning his wrist is nothing but a reminder of his own\u00a0failure, taunting him. <em>What's your name?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kookie, relax,\u201d Jimin\u2019s hands envelop his own on top of the blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tear it.\u201d Jungkook lets go of the blanket he hadn\u2019t even realized was about to become rags fit for wrapping a mummy, and drops his head on Jimin\u2019s shoulder. Jimin\u2019s hand comes up to stroke his hair and normally, Jungkook would shake him off and scowl at him for treating him like a kid, but, well. He\u2019ll humor him just this once.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, he\u2019s probably looking for you, right?\u201d Jimin\u2019s soft voice cuts through Jungkook\u2019s dazed thoughts, and he looks up at him from underneath the hand in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t even give him my name...\u201d Jungkook casts his eyes downward again as another wave of frustration washes over him. <em>You\u2019re such an idiot, Jeon Jungkook.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s going to stop the great Min Suga?\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice takes on a teasing quality. \u201cI thought you had more faith in him than that! If you\u2019re so worried about him not finding you... do you think you\u2019re making it easier or harder for him by hiding out in your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks up with wide eyes. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. Apparently Jimin can tell from his expression, and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thought so. Now, please get in the shower Jeon Jungkook, you smell terrible!\u201d Then he proceeds to tickle Jungkook out of his curled up position and manhandle him towards the bathroom, where he shoves him inside with threats of coming in with him if he doesn\u2019t get a move on. Jungkook\u2019s non-verbal response is to slam the door shut with a horrified face and lock it, but he\u2019s still smiling when he gets in the shower. Only a little though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s two days after that when Jungkook gets the call. He\u2019s in the dance studio, packing up his things after an intense session led by Hoseok when his phone starts tinkling with a beat that soon gets layered with Suga\u2019s rapping. Fishing his cell out of the pocket of his jacket, he frowns when the screen is lit up with a number he doesn\u2019t recognize. Hesitating for a second, he answers with a swipe of his thumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook?\u201d the unfamiliar voice at the other end asks. It\u2019s a guy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes? Who am I talking to?\u201d Jungkook sees Jimin look up at him from across the room, a frown creating a line between his brows.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry!\u201d the guy responds, sounding flustered. \u201cMy name is Kim Seokjin, I am the manager for Min Suga. I guess you might know why I\u2019m calling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jungkook says, faintly. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Jimin drop his things and start to move towards him, but he can\u2019t seem to focus on anything other than the voice coming out the speaker.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Seokjin laughs, \u201csounds like you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he, um,\u201d Jungkook sounds breathless even to himself, \u201cdoes he want to meet me?\u201d Jimin has reached him by now and is putting a hand on Jungkook\u2019s arm, his eyes full of silent questions.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and to Jungkook it lasts forever. In real time it\u2019s probably no more than a fraction of a section, before Seokjin\u2019s voice comes back on.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to talk to you about\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time Jungkook hangs up with a dazed expression, Jimin is practically vibrating out of his skin. \u201cWas that who I think it was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wants to meet me,\u201d Jungkook whispers, and turns huge, terrified eyes to Jimin. \u201cHoly shit, he wants to meet me! Hyung, what do I <em>do</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes are twinkling. \u201cYou meet him, of course!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook. 19 years old. College student.</p>\n<p>Yoongi stares down at the file the company has compiled from their research. Like this is a spy movie, and the boy on the photo looking up at him is his next target for assassination. Except he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s Yoongi\u2019s <em>soulmate</em>, and all of this is so fucking weird. Yoongi distantly wonders when he\u2019ll be able to think the word <em>soulmate</em> without it being in cursive.</p>\n<p>Jungkook. His name is Jungkook. He examines the photo that comes with the file once more, tries to match the name with the face. The only conclusion he manages to reach is that even if the picture is a good one, Jungkook was prettier in real life, and that no one should have eyes that expressive.</p>\n<p>He flips through the file again. Honestly, some of the information is downright creepy, and it feels suspiciously like a dating profile. Yoongi is ready to bet his career on Seokjin\u2019s personal involvement in the making of this. The pink headers are only the first clue. How do they even know what Jungkook\u2019s blood type is? Why would they feel compelled to compile a list of his favourite foods? And why does this profile include a description of Jungkook\u2019s ideal type?</p>\n<p>[to: seokjin-hyung] why did you include his ideal type. it doesn\u2019t even fit me</p>\n<p>[from: seokjin-hyung] I don\u2019t know, I think your legs are pretty nice! Just like SNSD\u2019s</p>\n<p>[to: seokjin-hyung] respectfully, i am going to murder you</p>\n<p>[from: seokjin-hyung] Don\u2019t worry, I think his type could also be summed up as Min Suga ;)</p>\n<p>Yoongi sighs, putting the phone away without answering. That\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it. Min Suga. Not Min Yoongi. He already regrets agreeing to this meeting, although it wasn\u2019t as if he was left with much choice. Seokjin had called him up again, gushing about how he contacted the boy, Jungkook, and \u201cdo you know what the very first thing he said was, Yoongi? He asked if you wanted to meet him!\u201d and well. There wasn\u2019t much Yoongi could say to that.</p>\n<p>So now he\u2019s here, in the back of an outdoor cafe, beanie pulled down, scarf pulled up and sunglasses perched safely on his nose. There\u2019s enough bite in the air that he regrets not wearing mittens. He takes another sip of his half full cup, even though he suspects he might throw up from having any more caffeine. It\u2019s gone lukewarm in the cold weather, and he grimaces but swallows anyway, waving away the waitress as she starts to approach. He won\u2019t stay for long anyway.</p>\n<p>He scratches absentmindedly at his forearm while scanning the faces of everyone passing by. His tattoo has itched ever since this morning. He guesses this means Jungkook is freaking out about meeting him. He snorts as his mind supplies him with an image of the wide eyed boy he met that day on the signing. Of course he\u2019s freaking out. He thinks he\u2019s about to meet <em>the</em> Min <em>Suga</em>. Too bad it\u2019s only Yoongi waiting for him.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the butterflies that had been relatively dormant until just now flutter up a storm inside of Yoongi. He doesn\u2019t need to look up to know what that means. He\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook tugs at his sleeves for what must be the billionth time. After this meeting, they will probably permanently hang below his fingertips.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s starting to regret declining both Jimin\u2019s and Taehyung\u2019s offers to come along, but he just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of them being there to witness this embarrassing moment. Because Jungkook doesn\u2019t doubt that he will make a fool of himself. He\u2019s going to meet Min Suga. Alone. Without distractions. And he really is trying to restrain himself because the last thing he wants is for his soulmate to think he\u2019s a freak, but all it will take is one of those sweet gummy smiles from Suga and Jungkook is going to die. Rest in pieces, as Taehyung would say.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too late now anyway, because Jungkook can see the cafe Seokjin described to him over the phone. He casts a quick glance at his reflection in a nearby store window. His outfit is pretty much the same as he\u2019d wear any other day, because Jimin had told him he didn\u2019t need the added anxiety of wearing something he\u2019s not comfortable in. His reflection is just him looking nervous in Timberlands, black skinny jeans and a warm jacket with a beanie jammed down over his hair. After confirming there is nothing on his face, Jungkook squares his shoulders and stalks toward the cafe.</p>\n<p>He sweeps over the patrons when he gets close enough, and his gaze sticks on a guy in the far back, hunched in on himself. He\u2019s wearing enough disguise that his face is almost completely obscured, but Jungkook recognizes that beanie as one from several broadcasts, and his heartbeat trips over itself before picking up again with triple the pace because that\u2019s <em>him</em>. As if on cue, the guy looks up, straight at him. Jungkook takes a deep breath, and walks forward.</p>\n<p>Smack dab into a table. All the cups and plates stacked on it make a terrible crashing sound, cutlery rattling against the porcelain. Every single eye is suddenly trained on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook mutters, trying to steady the cups while wishing the ground would just open up and swallow him already. After making sure the rickety table won\u2019t tip over as soon as he lets go, Jungkook starts making his way toward the back. This time his eyes are firmly fixed on the ground in favor of very carefully sidestepping all obstacles, but also because his face feels so red that all it would take to recreate the Japanese flag would be to put him against a white backdrop.</p>\n<p>When he finally reaches the table he all but collapses in his chair, hoping it looks like he\u2019s being aloof and not too obviously because his legs are shaking so badly he can barely stand. Then he looks up.</p>\n<p>Min Suga has tugged down his scarf, and his full pink lips are smirking. \u201cNice entrance, kid,\u201d he says, and oh god, his <em>voice</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Jungkook breathes out, and just the fact that he is still capable of speech when Min Suga is right in front of him is nothing short of a miracle. He swallows forcibly, because his heart is climbing up his throat and trying to choke him, and the ability to breathe is one Jungkook values. Almost as much as the ability to form actual sentences, speaking of which, that would come in handy now. \u201cNice to meet you. Um, officially. Suga-hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smirk slips off Suga\u2019s face, but Jungkook barely notices because he is so busy staring at everything he can lay his eyes on. Suga\u2019s cheeks are a bit red from the cold, as is the tip of his nose, and his hair looks so soft and fluffy and Jungkook really wants to touch it, wants to run his fingers through it and slip his hands underneath that beanie\u2014<em>oh my god stop it</em> says a voice in his head, a voice that sounds suspiciously like Jimin\u2019s. Jungkook snaps his gaze back to Suga\u2019s eyes \u2014 or more correctly, to the sunglasses obscuring Suga\u2019s eyes from view. Jungkook wishes he would take them off because it's making his skin crawl like he\u2019s being scrutinized, without actually knowing if Suga is looking at him.</p>\n<p>As if he can read Jungkook\u2019s mind, Suga slips off his sunglasses and puts them on the table. It\u2019s like a hand pushes into Jungkook\u2019s chest and grabs his heart. Slightly winded by the strong reaction, he takes in Suga\u2019s face. He looks tired, but he\u2019s still so unbelievably beautiful. His skin is smooth and pale in the bleak daylight, accentuating the dark smudges underneath his eyes even more sharply. The beanie is pushing his fringe down into his eyes, those slanted pretty dark brown eyes that\u2014 are meeting his own dead on. Jungkook realises that he\u2019s staring again and quickly flicks his gaze down at the table, biting his lip while silently cursing himself. A slightly awkward silence descends.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook barely has time to process the fact that Suga just called him by name before there are careful, cold fingertips tilting his chin up. It\u2019s barely a touch but Jungkook feels like every single nerve in his body is lighting up like the midnight sky on New Year\u2019s. Every sensory cell is straining toward that singularity, that one point of skin contact because <em>Suga is touching him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d It\u2019s not a squeak but it\u2019s not exactly normal pitch either, but Jungkook doesn\u2019t even care because Suga withdraws his hand. Jungkook is torn between wanting to grab onto it and asking him to never touch him again, because Jungkook obviously cannot handle it. He struggles to get his facial expression under control.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a shift. It\u2019s so so subtle, but it\u2019s like something slots into place and Suga\u2019s eyes become a bit more shuttered. He leans back in his chair, arms folding over his chest. \u201cAbout the tattoos. Who did you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many people did you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook blinks, bewildered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean, how many people have I told that\u2026 we\u2019re\u2026\u201d Jungkook trails off, feeling his cheeks heat again, and Suga\u2019s lips thin as he nods. \u201cUh, only Taehyung and Jimin? They\u2019re my friends,\u201d he adds hastily, because Suga\u2019s expression is darkening.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how many people have they told?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one, I think?\u201d Jungkook twists his hands into his sleeves again, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Suga picks up his sunglasses and puts them back on. Jungkook gets the sudden impression that this entire conversation is slipping through his fingers. \u201cTell them not to breathe a word, and this whole thing will blow over.\u201d He gets up and pauses, one hand on the table, before adding, \u201cFair warning, you should lay low for a while. Some of the fans might be pissed at you right now.\u201d Then he\u2019s. Leaving?</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suga turns halfway back to look at him and Jungkook feels like the hand inside his chest is squeezing his heart in its fist. Suga, sweet, soft Suga with the sleep circles is suddenly surrounded by an air of intimidation. Untouchable, just like when he\u2019s on stage. \u201cDon\u2019t you want\u2026.?\u201d He trails off, unsure of what he\u2019s about to say. <em>To get to know me? My number? Don\u2019t you want... me?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t date my fans.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so cold. Jungkook hunches back into his jacket, chasing that warmth he felt just seconds before.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 we\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook feels small and stupid. There\u2019s something shrivelling up inside of him, like a scrap of paper being set on fire.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suga leaves. Jungkook lays his hands on the surface of the metal table. It\u2019s cold as ice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon takes one look at Yoongi\u2019s face as he comes through the door and promptly shuts his mouth. Yoongi just breezes past him and into the studio. He shuts the door and leans against it, closing his eyes.</p>\n<p>What the fuck.</p>\n<p>He was going to tell the kid \u201cSorry to disappoint you, but I can\u2019t do this, it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me, yadda yadda\u201d and then fuck off. Except that, Jungkook was... really fucking adorable. When he crashed right into that table and was so awkwardly flustered about it, Yoongi\u2019s jaw <em>ached</em> from how hard he was clenching it trying not to burst out laughing. And the way he <em>looked</em> at Yoongi, with that lip bite that should be fucking <em>illegal</em>.</p>\n<p>He called him Suga. <em>Suga-hyung</em>, so sweetly and it stung. Because Yoongi already can\u2019t stand the thought of those starry eyes full of awe turning dull and flat with disappointment, doesn\u2019t ever want to be the one to cause that look to fade away.</p>\n<p>He screws his eyes shut even tighter at the memory of the sheer <em>hurt</em> on Jungkook\u2019s face. The cold invading him with every step away from that table had him gritting his teeth. It isn\u2019t his emotion anyway, he tells himself. It\u2019s Jungkook\u2019s, just an echo. Because of the tattoos.</p>\n<p>Somehow that\u2019s worse.</p>\n<p>He realizes he\u2019s closed his other hand over the tattoo on his wrist like a vice. When he lets go, there\u2019s an imprint of four fingers that rapidly change color from white to red. The words underneath them feel like a mockery. <em>I think you might be my soulmate.</em></p>\n<p>The universe is such a bitch. After that time, after her, and it tries to tell him that his soulmate is another fan? Yeah, no. Yoongi\u2019s been there, done that, suffered the consequences and learned his lesson.</p>\n<p>Fuck that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] how\u2019s the date going??? ;) ;) ;)</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] r u guys makin out and that why ur not answering</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] r u too busy staring at his face</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] ok but honestly r u kissing????</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] ...jungkook?</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] did something happen</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] kookie pls answer</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] did he say something??????</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] r u home</p>\n<p>[to: jimin] yes</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] i\u2019m coming over</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s concentration is broken by the sound of the studio door opening. He swivels around in his chair to face the person entering. It\u2019s Namjoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Yoongi spins another lap. It\u2019s actually going rather awful. The beat feels too heavy, too compact. Every time he presses the replay button, his displeasure deepens. The song lacks an element to lift it, but Yoongi has no idea what that element is.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d It comes out shorter than intended, but the headache pulsing behind his temples is wearing him down. He fiddles with the buttons on the audio mixer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, actually.\u201d Namjoon drops into a chair next to him. \u201cCame to tell you it seems like things have calmed down with the fanbase again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi makes a face. Normally, the Jungkook incident wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. It\u2019s not exactly rare for a fan to forget themselves and get too close to their idol. But as luck would have it, it\u2019s been a slow week. In the absence of other news, some internet magazines had picked up on the rumors and spun them into articles that were nothing but speculation. Naturally, the fanbase had been buzzing with ideas of who that guy who \u201cdared to touch Suga\u201d was. However, since there was nothing more than a few blurry videos and no name to point blame to, and with zero comments from the record label or Suga himself, the whole thing had started to die down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut hyung,\u201d Namjoon begins, and Yoongi already knows he won\u2019t like this from his tone of voice. \u201cAre you really just gonna let that guy go? That\u2019s a bit...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the one always going on about all that deep shit about not being bound by the rules of society or whatever?\u201d Yoongi points out, raising his brows. \u201cJust last week you went on a rant about how \u2018the existence of soulmates is breeding hatred and intolerance, fabricating affection while alienating any true form of love born from the hearts of people brave enough to exist outside this corrupt system.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay, I might have said that, but you\u2019re just using that as an excuse to run away!\u201d Yoongi narrows his eyes at the way Namjoon\u2019s voice increases in volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful there, Namjoonie. I\u2019m still your hyung, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t look out for you? I mean, I get you had a bad experience, but do you honestly think every single fan is like that? And what about Jungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Yoongi sounds defensive even to his own ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think this is fair to him, not even giving him a chance? Hyung, you know how I feel about soulmates, but even I get there\u2019s a reason his words are on your arm!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. Don\u2019t talk about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr what? I thought you didn\u2019t even care!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi shoots out of the chair with so much force it spins out from under him and slams into the wall. \u201cGet out.\u201d Namjoon opens his mouth again, looking far from done, but Yoongi is so furious he\u2019s trembling all over. \u201cNo, get the <em>fuck</em> out.\u201d Namjoon works his jaw in frustration, but thinks better of it and gets up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s too late, hyung. Just call him or something.\u201d Then the door shuts and he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Well then, Yoongi reflects as he stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving. That just leaves one person that has yet to yell at him. Might as well get that over with, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is why he\u2019s out in the street, knocking at the door of a dance studio past eleven o\u2019clock on a weekday. His breath forms clouds of mist that hang in the air. Blowing hot air into his hands while waiting for footsteps from the other side, Yoongi makes a mental note to buy those damn mittens before his fingers fall off.</p>\n<p>The door clicks, then opens a fraction, a thin line of light falling onto the pavement. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door flings open with such force it bangs off the wall. Yoongi doesn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cYoongi-hyung!\u201d Hoseok beams as he reaches over the threshold to grab Yoongi by his collar and drag him inside.\u201dWhat brings you here? Finally decided to brush up on your dance skills?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d Yoongi responds dryly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just this little thing.\u201d He shrugs out of his jacket and waves his arm around a bit, figuring the message will get across. Hoseok\u2019s eyes grow huge and he immediately snatches Yoongi\u2019s wrist to gawk at the words there.</p>\n<p>Then he proceeds to lick his thumb and rub at the tattoo. Yoongi snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit, it\u2019s real!\u201d Hoseok squeals, prompting Yoongi to raise his free hand to cover his ear. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019ve been waiting <em>years</em> for this. There is someone destined for your grumpiness after all! <em>Tell me</em>, who is it? Oh god, Jungkook is going to be so devastated when he finds out. Or wait, is that why he hasn\u2019t been coming to lessons\u2026.\u201d Hoseok continues mumbling to himself, but Yoongi freezes up, brain stuck on one word.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s one of the underclassmen I teach\u2026 He\u2019s a bit of a brat honestly, but really passionate, and he has the biggest crush on you, it\u2019s adorable. This one time he was gonna show me a dance video on his phone and the current video was a compilation called,\u201d Hoseok throws up a pair of air quotes, \u201c\u2018<em>suga\u2019s top ten hottest moments, wink emoji</em>\u2019... I thought his head was going to actually explode from blushing so hard, it was <em>hilarious</em>, he couldn\u2019t look me in the eye for a <em>week</em>\u2014\u201d Hoseok finally cuts off and Yoongi\u2019s thankful because has no idea what part of that sentence to address first. \u201cWait, why are you asking about that though? Do you know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi rasps. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh. It\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hoseok says. \u201cWhat? <em>Jungkookie</em> is your soulmate? Seriously? Wow, I guess all that stuff kinda makes sense then\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie, are you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s shuffling coming from behind the door, and a voice that sounds like Taehyung saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him\u201d and Jimin furiously hissing \u201cYou can\u2019t kill a celebrity Tae, you\u2019ll go to prison and then Kookie will be even more sad!\u201d Jungkook dunks his head back against the wall, creating a dull thump.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kookie,\u201d it\u2019s Taehyung. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook would deny his request, but there\u2019s a distinct clicking that tells him Jimin is in the process of picking the lock right now anyway. Jungkook knew he shouldn\u2019t have showed him that YouTube video. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The knob turns and Taehyung slides in before shutting the door behind him. He doesn\u2019t ask why Jungkook is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, only walks up and nudges his shoulder until Jungkook scoots forward so Taehyung can slide down and sit behind him. Taehyung wraps his arms around Jungkook\u2019s middle and hooks his chin over his shoulder. It\u2019s silent, except for the occasional sniffle from Jungkook. Taehyung doesn\u2019t say anything about that either.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you\u2026 is it because of his image, hyung?\u201d Jungkook keeps his voice purposefully low, but it still cracks just a little. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s\u2026 ashamed to be seen with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pathetic. Jungkook is so pathetic. Of course he\u2019s not good enough for Suga, whom Jungkook admires more than anyone. Suga who is famous despite being only a few years older, who writes and produces his own music, who has thousands and thousands of fans, Suga who is creative and amazing and so beautiful it hurts. Compared to that, Jungkook is nothing. Just a kid who hasn\u2019t accomplished anything in life. What does it matter that the universe has apparently decided they\u2019re soulmates? It changes nothing in the end, just the added sting of not even being wanted by the person he\u2019s meant for. If not even his soulmate can stand being with him, who will?</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah,\u201d Taehyung\u2019s arms tighten around his waist, \u201cif you\u2019re not good enough for him, no one in this world is. <em>He\u2019s</em> the stupid one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my <em>soulmate</em>, hyung,\u201d Jungkook chokes out. \u201cAnd I disappointed him.\u201d He draws his knees up to his chest, folding in on himself. Taehyung follows the motion, wrapping himself around Jungkook like a monkey.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Jungkook\u2019s shoulders stop trembling, and he\u2019s left sniveling wetly, trying to wipe his running nose with the backs of his hands. Taehyung offers his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna use this?\u201d</p>\n<p>It startles a small laugh out of Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s gross, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, suit yourself then,\u201d Taehyung grins.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock on the door, and Jimin\u2019s head pops inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna come out and watch movies?\u201d His head withdraws and a hand dangling a plastic convenience store bag appears in its stead. \u201cI bought ice cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Is this your idea of cheering me up? You\u2019ve watched too many dramas\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung throws his head back and laughs, and it almost drowns out Jimin\u2019s affronted \u201cThis brat\u2026!\u201d from the outside.</p>\n<p>They end up having a Marvel marathon, all three crammed together on Jungkook\u2019s bed in front of his laptop. Jimin and Taehyung act even more silly than usual, making faces at him and at one point even smearing ice cream on his nose. Jungkook knows it\u2019s just to make him laugh, because every time he cracks a smile they yell and pile on top of him like overly excited puppies, dangerously close to overturning the laptop.</p>\n<p>Still, as annoying as it is, the pain of rejection that\u2019s been like a bruise pulsing just underneath his skin dulls just a little. The edges of Jungkook\u2019s lips upturn slightly, and immediately he finds himself eating his pillow as his hyungs throw themselves on top of him with cries of <em>\u201cKookie-yah!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cGet <em>off</em> of me, oh my god!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let me get this right,\u201d Hoseok starts. \u201cYou let security drag him off without a word at your first meeting, ignored him for days, then met him just to reject him without even telling him why? No offense Yoongi, but you\u2019re being a shitty soulmate so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi bristles. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t given him a chance to! Honestly, I love you and all,\u201d Yoongi makes a face more out of habit than anything else, \u201cbut right now I\u2019m kinda mad at you for hurting Jungkook like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s already got all of these ideas about me, though,\u201d Yoongi scowls and picks at some lint on his shirtsleeve. \u201cBet he\u2019s gonna be disappointed when he finds out who Min Suga is. I\u2019m just sparing the kid the trouble, \u2018s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung,\u201d Hoseok says and Yoongi pointedly does not look at his expression. \u201cDo you really think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. Hyung, I\u2019m sorry to inform you that even I, who have known you for ages, am pretty disappointed to find out how stupid you actually are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you say to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, don\u2019t kill me yet, I still need to deliver the rest of this riveting best friend speech\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what else will be <em>riveting</em>? Your <em>funeral</em>, which I will make sure to attend as your so called <em>best friend</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok dances out of reach, grabbing a chair and brandishing it in front of him like a shield. \u201cI only meant that you thinking about yourself as split into two separate people is what\u2019s stupid! Honestly hyung, I get that there\u2019s a difference between who you are before you have coffee in the morning\u2014because frankly you\u2019re terrifying\u2014and who you are when you perform, but it\u2019s not like you become an entirely different person any time you go on stage!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might not think so, but to others there\u2019s a difference\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo all those stupid videos and vines you and Namjoon upload, every single tweet you post, every interview, that\u2019s all fake to you? I\u2019ve seen that stuff too, and trust me hyung, there really isn\u2019t that much of a difference.\u201d Hoseok grins at him. \u201cYou\u2019re still just an asshole. <em>ThatIloveanddearlyrespect</em>, please sit down\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe still one of my fans though. You know I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Date my fans\u2019,\u201d Hoseok fills in, with a roll of his eyes. \u201cYeah I know all about your golden principle, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour imitation skills are shit, I sound nothing like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Hoseok drawls, purposefully layering on his own accent thick just to see Yoongi make a disgusted face. \u201cBut you can\u2019t even make one exception? For your own soulmate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seems like a good kid. I\u2019d just fuck up his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHate to break it to you, hyung, but you\u2019ve probably done that already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s teeth flash briefly in a humorless smile. <em>Right</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook rolls out of bed the next morning groaning and cursing his reluctant promise to \u201cget up, get dressed, and go to class like a functional human being\u201d from the previous night. His mood only declines further when he gets a look at himself in the mirror above the bathroom sink while brushing his teeth. His hair is sticking up in every direction, face ruddy and swollen, eyes puffy. Still, he doesn\u2019t even look a quarter as bad as he <em>feels</em>, so that might be something.</p>\n<p><em>This is the face Min Suga looked at for five minutes and decided he couldn\u2019t stand</em>, Jungkook thinks. He breaks eye contact with his reflection and bows over to spit toothpaste foam into the sink. For the rest of his morning routine, he avoids the mirror.</p>\n<p>The day continues in the same gloomy manner. In the bleak daylight and in the middle of his usual everyday pattern, the truth feels even more harsh and unavoidable. Jungkook goes to class and thinks, <em>the person I admire hates me</em>. He listens to the professor drone on, and the doodles on his notes from last week spelling out <em>Min Suga</em> over and over feel like a cruel joke. Still, he can\u2019t bring himself to cross them out. He packs up his books, and trudges to the next lecture, thinking, <em>my soulmate hates me</em>.</p>\n<p>By lunchtime he\u2019s worked himself into such a slump that he doesn\u2019t feel energized enough to take another step.</p>\n<p>[to: the #1 hyung kookie loves most &lt;333] wtf hyung when did you change your name in my phone book</p>\n<p>[from: the #1 hyung kookie loves most &lt;333] what u mean kookie, u obviously knew it was me from the description!!</p>\n<p>[to: the #1 hyung kookie loves most &lt;333] ...i\u2019m changing it back</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] nooo why 3</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] ur breaking my heart</p>\n<p>[to: jimin] sorry hyung i don\u2019t think i can do this</p>\n<p>[to: jimin] i\u2019m going home</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] ..ok, but come to the dance session 2nite? hoseok-hyung\u2019s been asking for u</p>\n<p>[to: jimin] alright.</p>\n<p>As soon as he gets inside his dorm room he collapses among the messy blankets on his bed. Remembering to set an alarm beforehand, he curls up into a ball and smashes his face into the pillow. Maybe if he\u2019s lucky, he\u2019ll somehow manage to suffocate himself in his sleep and never have to get up again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the alarm goes off a few hours later, Jungkook somehow feels even worse than before. Still, he manages to arrive at the dance studio on time, feeling groggy and unsteady. Jimin casts concerned glances at him, but doesn\u2019t actually come over to talk. Jungkook stumbles through the routine. He tries to concentrate, to draw upon that inner passion that always flares up when he dances, but today there are only burnt out embers. When it\u2019s finally over, he feels exhausted even though he\u2019s barely sweating.</p>\n<p>Hoseok seems to be paying more attention to him than usual. Jungkook chalks it up to his terrible performance. When he\u2019s at the door, he\u2019s called back by Hoseok\u2019s voice. He trots over, prepared for a scolding.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s Jungkook\u2019s imagination, but Hoseok\u2019s eyes flick down to his wrist briefly. Jungkook self-consciously puts it behind his back, despite the wristband hiding the curly script from view. Hoseok opens his mouth, strange expression on his face that Jungkook can\u2019t place, but then seems to change his mind and just asks, \u201cYou okay, Jungkook-ah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, just tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok deflates. He ruffles Jungkook\u2019s hair. \u201cOkay, then. Go home and get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, hyung,\u201d Jungkook repeats mechanically, and leaves. Jimin\u2019s waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to walk back with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook scrubs the back of his hand across his eyes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just gonna crash as soon as I get back. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, what are you sorry about?\u201d Jimin gasps, hand coming up to rest over his heart. \u201cIs this finally an apology for not treating your hyung with the love and respect he truly deserves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Jungkook responds dryly, dredging up sarcasm from somewhere deep within to ease the tense line of Jimin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGoodnight, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep well, Jungkook-ah!\u201d Jimin yells after him as he walks away.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s so tired when he stumbles upstairs that he barely sees where he\u2019s walking. Fishing around for the keys to the dorm in his pocket he leans against the wall for support, but then his brain processes the sight before him and he freezes. The door to his room is ajar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi is having a bad day.</p>\n<p>Things were awkward between him and Namjoon, and he still couldn\u2019t work out a solution to how to fix that damn track. Normally, he\u2019d ask Namjoon for another opinion and they\u2019d discuss it until they reached a conclusion together. But today, he looked up at Namjoon\u2019s turned away profile and knew it wasn\u2019t an option. On top of that, the conversation he and Hoseok had was still rolling around in his head. Mulling over what\u2019s started to feel like a collection of failures, he only ended up more frustrated. He and Namjoon spent the time working very little and snapping at each other with increasing bite until Yoongi left early, fed up.</p>\n<p>Now he\u2019s splayed out on top of the sofa, scrolling through fan sites. It\u2019s something of a habit. Whenever Yoongi feels down and tired, he likes to remind himself that people out there appreciate what he\u2019s trying to do, and support him to the best of their ability. Granted, some of the stuff on there is a bit creepy, but Yoongi finds most of it comforting.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s scrolling aimlessly, smiling slightly at a sweet message addressed to him saying \u201cSuga made me want to study music! One day I want to meet him and give him a song I\u2019ve produced myself. Oppa, I love you! Fighting~!\u201d when his eyes snag on a title. Scrolling back upward, he clicks on the thread, absentmindedly noting that it was last updated only this evening. As Yoongi scans the content he feels increasingly uneasy, and then his eyes widen in horror.</p>\n<p>@<em>SugaIsLove_SugaIsLife</em> posted: hi everyone~! do u guys remember that ratchet guy that harassed Suga oppa at the last fansign? apparently this is him\u2026 anyone know who he is?<br>\n<em>see attached file .jpg</em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a picture of Jungkook, a bit blurry but clearly recognizable. It\u2019s the following comments that make Yoongi\u2019s heart beat faster.</p>\n<p>@<em>Mine_suga</em> replied: omg :00 totally know that guy!!! he\u2019s in college with my sis\u2026 jungkook, i think?</p>\n<p>After that a bunch of people has replied, each one coming forth with more and more information about Jungkook, egged on by increasingly aggressive responses, until:</p>\n<p>@<em>sugaIsMySugarxx</em> replied: you know some ppl say this jungkook guy wrote on suga oppa\u2019s arm to convince him they were soulmates?? he is obviously sick lol that\u2019s disgusting. like suga would have a soulmate like him\u2026. someone should teach him a lesson. you don\u2019t mess with oppa &gt;:(</p>\n<p>@<em>sugamonster88</em> replied: hey, someone posted his address right? let\u2019s go there tonight and show him... u guys in???</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t wait to see how many people have agreed. He\u2019s out of his apartment in ten seconds flat, tugging on shoes and snagging a jacket on the way. Yoongi hasn\u2019t driven a car in ages, too used to Seokjin chauffeuring him and Namjoon around, but now he tears out of the garage. His heartbeat is smattering in a rhythm of <em>pleasepleaseplease don\u2019t let anything have happened, don\u2019t let him be hurt</em>. Nausea swirls in his stomach.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s about halfway there, the steady ache that\u2019s been present inside of him ever since his last meeting with Jungkook thumps and transforms into an inferno of apprehension and fear so potent it\u2019s like a sucker punch to the gut. Yoongi doubles over the wheel from the force of it, car swerving in the lane. Some asshole behind him honks. Yoongi grits his teeth and steps on the gas because he\u2019ll be damned if he lets Jungkook get hurt because of him. He\u2019s pretty sure he runs two red lights after that, but he\u2019s <em>almost there</em> and <em>he needs to be there</em> right this very second.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s out of the car and running, and he hasn\u2019t run properly since gym class in high school, what the fuck, how is he already this out of breath? He\u2019s approaching the building and he presses his legs to run faster, to take the stairs two steps at a time and he\u2019s in the hallway, he feels like he might throw up from the emotions whipping up a storm inside of him, and there\u2019s the door\u2014</p>\n<p>Yoongi tears into the dorm, feeling like he\u2019ll never breathe normally again.</p>\n<p>The first thing he notices is that the room is absolutely trashed. There are feathers everywhere. They remind him of fallen snow, the comparison innocent and sinister at the same time.</p>\n<p>In the center of the room stands Jungkook. He doesn\u2019t look hurt, and Yoongi\u2019s hit with such a tidal wave of relief that he staggers. Jungkook spins around at the noise and comes face to face with Yoongi. His eyes are wild and he\u2019s clutching a baseball bat above his head. He stares at Yoongi, all color bleached out of his skin except for two red spots high on his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Yoongi coughs out, and hangs onto the doorframe for support, desperately fighting to get his breath back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jungkook says, still wide eyed, and stumbles. In a flash Yoongi is beside him, prying the bat out of Jungkook\u2019s stiff grip, gently uncurling his fingers. Yoongi thought he was too exhausted to move at a speed like that, possibly for the rest of his life, but apparently not.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, Jungkookie,\u201d Yoongi doesn\u2019t know why the nickname slips in but right now he doesn\u2019t care, because anything for Jungkook to stop looking like that, \u201cYou okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook breathes, and slumps even more in Yoongi\u2019s grip. Yoongi carefully lowers them to sit on the floor. Faint tremors are running through Jungkook\u2019s entire body, and Yoongi wants to gather him up in his arms, cradle his head like he\u2019s something precious.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid,\u201d Yoongi rasps and the feelings turning his insides into a blender are gradually calming, spinning more slowly, numbing with confusion. \u201cJungkookie. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d Jungkook asks, still not taking his eyes off of Yoongi like he might disappear if he does.</p>\n<p>Yoongi laughs, breathless and rough, an edge of hysteria slipping in. \u201cYeah kid, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook has trouble processing this situation, and exactly how he ended up in the middle of it. One moment he was finally on his way home after this shit day, exhausted enough to be tripping over his feet and wanting nothing more than to collapse in his bed. The next he\u2019s suddenly sitting in the corridor outside the faculty offices, Suga\u2019s jacket draped over his still faintly trembling shoulders, listening to Suga\u2019s raised voice as he chews out the management for the lack of security. Jungkook can picture him even through the wall, all sharp gestures and cutting tongue. It is utterly bizarre. Jungkook\u2019s mind is too jumbled to properly react to all these quick turns anymore, eyelids drooping as he slumps back against the wall.</p>\n<p>He pulls the jacket over his shoulders tighter around him. It\u2019s soft and warm, well worn. The whole thing is so clich\u00e9 but just for this fleeting moment when he is alone, Jungkook lets himself indulge in the feeling of being safe and protected.</p>\n<p>The corridor is empty and brightly lit. The rays emitted by the row of fluorescent lamps feel like needles stabbing at his eyeballs. Jungkook tucks his face into the jacket, inhaling deeply. A rich smell invades his nostrils, like pine forests in the autumn, with a lingering hint of cigarette smoke. It also smells painfully like a place that could be home to Jungkook. The feeling reaches in like a hook and tugs at his heart. Jungkook objectively knows it\u2019s because Suga is his soulmate, and soulmates are <em>supposed</em> to smell like home, but it still affects him, warmth curling inside his chest like a small flame. He rubs his cheek against the material.</p>\n<p>The voices inside the office have lowered to calming murmurs, and Jungkook grows increasingly drowsy, burrowing further into the wall and burying his nose into Suga\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p>Then the door suddenly opens, and Suga steps out. Jungkook startles so badly he jerks upright and slams the back of his head against the wall. He squeezes his eyes shut against the dull throb of what will undoubtedly become a bruise.</p>\n<p>If Suga has any reaction towards walking in on Jungkook practically trying to shove his jacket up his nose, he doesn\u2019t show it, just walks over and crouches down.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, they\u2019re all very apologetic this happened,\u201d Suga starts off, scoffing, but Jungkook is having trouble following. Being this close to Suga in combination with his fatigue is far from ideal, and the emotions blend together into a mixture that makes his head spin. \u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to keeping it on the down low, but your dorm room is off-limits. You can\u2019t go back there until they\u2019ve cleaned it up and gotten someone to fix the lock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook thinks back on the sight that greeted him when he\u2019d pushed open his door. His belongings strewn all over the floor, pillows cut up and mattress leaking stuffing from several long gashes, the walls covered in writing warning him to stay away from Suga, telling him next time he won\u2019t be so lucky. He gives an involuntary shudder, prompting Suga to place his palms on Jungkook\u2019s thighs. He rubs them up and down in a way that\u2019s probably meant to be calming but to Jungkook is anything but. He stares at the delicate, wobbly fingers resting on top of his legs, tingling spreading outward from the point of contact. Suga\u2019s palms are hot enough to feel like a brand even through the fabric of his sweatpants.</p>\n<p>Suga is saying something again, but the words get hopelessly lost in the buzzing sound in Jungkook\u2019s ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cS-sorry?\u201d he stammers. Suga doesn\u2019t seem to have picked up on the fact that Jungkook\u2019s attention span is hanging on by a thread. His expression is troubled, and his eyes are fixed on a spot just above and to the left of Jungkook\u2019s eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, that if you don\u2019t have a place to stay...\u201d he mutters. Then he suddenly drags a hand down his face, groaning in defeat. \u201cFuck, this was a stupid idea. Ignore that, you don\u2019t have to go anywhere with me, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Jungkook hastens to get out, tripping over himself to get that expression off the elder\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2019d go anywhere with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>...That wasn\u2019t what he meant to say, Jungkook reflects as his cheeks heat up. For a second, Suga looks stunned. His eyes widen and his lips part, before his expressions smooths out with an amused chuckle, and god, Jungkook wants to hide.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnywhere, huh?\u201d he smirks, and Jungkook can\u2019t even open his mouth in fear of embarrassing himself further. \u201cWell, luckily for you, my place isn\u2019t that far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which is how Jeon Jungkook, college student and closet fanboy, ends up crashing at Min Suga\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>It only takes about half of the car ride for Jungkook to start immensely regretting his decision to, apparently, <em>move in with Min Suga</em>. The inside of the car is so quiet that all of the sounds from the street seem amplified by ten. Suga messes with the dials on the car radio, skipping to some channel where a soft RnB song is playing. The lyrics are on the topic of soulmates. Suga turns off the radio again. Jungkook can\u2019t stop fidgeting in his seat.</p>\n<p>By the time they reach the actual apartment Jungkook can\u2019t wait for this hellscape of a day to be over. If the nerves weren\u2019t keeping him so tightly strung, he\u2019d be ready to pass out where he stands. Suga makes him pull his hood up and then leads him into a apartment complex that screams money. Jungkook keeps shifting his weight from foot to foot while Suga taps a code to unlock the door, and then he\u2019s being ushered inside a hallway, and further into the apartment.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is tired, but he still makes sure to take in every surface he can lay his eyes upon because what the hell, he\u2019s in <em>Suga\u2019s apartment</em>. The interior isn\u2019t really anything special, just a lot of open space and windows overlooking the city. Everything looks stylish and blank and expensive. Jungkook wonders if Suga is the one who decorated his flat, or if he had others do it for him. The rooms lack personal touch\u2014or rather, that lived in feeling.</p>\n<p>Maybe Suga doesn't really live here. Maybe he has a lot of different apartments. Why would he even take Jungkook into his home in the first place? Suga doesn\u2019t know Jungkook. He doesn\u2019t even <em>like</em> him. What if he just leaves again after dumping him here?</p>\n<p>Jungkook is brought out of his worries when they arrive at a plain door, barely managing to stumble to a stop instead of continuing to walk straight into Suga.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can sleep in here,\u201d Suga gestures at the dark room inside. There\u2019s not really anything except a bed and a lot of large windows. Jungkook hesitantly makes his way inside, clutching his bag to his chest. Under Suga\u2019s watchful gaze, he carefully lowers himself onto the edge of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, thanks, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suga lingers in the doorway, looking about as awkward as Jungkook feels. \u201cUh, well, if you need anything I\u2019ll just be\u2026\u201d Suga jerks his head vaguely to the rest of the apartment, and clears his throat needlessly. \u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seeing Suga look uncomfortable is so weird that Jungkook almost forgets he\u2019s feeling the same way. \u201cOkay,\u201d he replies softly. He trains his gaze on his feet, before he can\u2019t help but add, \u201cGoodnight, Suga-hyung,\u201d shyly glancing up at him through his bangs.</p>\n<p>Suga\u2019s silhouette stiffens, and something akin to a grimace shows up on his face. Framed by the light from behind him, the beams reflecting on his brightly bleached hair creates the effect of a halo surrounding his head. His shadow reaches all the way to Jungkook\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Yoongi,\u201d he says, like he isn\u2019t giving Jungkook explicit permission to be more familiar with him than any fan should have the right to be. Then he closes the door, leaving Jungkook sitting there wide eyed on the bed, lips silently shaping around the syllables of Yoongi\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>Despite Jungkook being more tired than he\u2019s been possibly in his entire life, it takes him a while to fall asleep. He keeps shifting, trying not to think about Suga, about <em>Yoongi</em>, being so close to him, just a door away. Eventually, the muted sounds of traffic from outside lull him into a heavy sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi closes the bedroom door on Jungkook, then lets out a quiet breath, and decidedly does <em>not</em> think about Jungkook on the bed looking bashful and soft, gazing up at him from under his dark eyelashes, saying <em>Goodnight, Suga-hyung</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead he takes the only rightful course of action and calls Seokjin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell, Yoongi,\u201d Seokjin groans when he picks up on the eighth signal. \u201cI know I\u2019m your manager but I put up with you every waking hour of the day, do you not think I am entitled to my eight goddamn hours of rest\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Yoongi hisses into the phone. \u201cJungkook is in my apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seokjin\u2019s voice immediately loses that sleepy whine. \u201cJungkook? What do you mean he\u2019s in your apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>mean</em>,\u201d Yoongi talks through his gritted teeth, \u201cthat he is in my guest room right now, <em>sleeping</em>, because some fans apparently found out his address and decided to fucking <em>pay him a visit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Seokjin says. \u201cOh shit. Is he okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d Yoongi sighs, slumping down on a kitchen stool. \u201cHe can\u2019t go back to his dorm though, it\u2019s completely trashed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Seokjin huffs, and Yoongi bites his lip. Then, \u201cYou took him back to <em>your</em> place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what the fuck was I supposed to do, he was completely out of it! I thought he\u2019d pass out on the spot!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Yoongi,\u201d Seokjin croons, and there\u2019s a world of things in his voice that Yoongi doesn\u2019t ever want to discuss, not even under the threat of being shot in the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Seokjin responds cheerily. \u201cI think this might be good for you. Well, then, see you tomorrow!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, don\u2019t you fucking dare\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin hangs up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seokjin\u2019s sunny disposition early the next morning makes Yoongi want to throw his coffee in his smug face. Of course, Yoongi would never do something like that. It would be a terrible waste of precious coffee, coffee which he needs to be able to deal with all this bullshit the universe is serving him lately.</p>\n<p>\u201cTough night, Yoongi-ah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe he needs to rethink that.</p>\n<p>Seokjin is still his hyung though, and has too much power over the food Yoongi puts in his mouth, so Yoongi bitterly swallows the verbal abuse his mind wants to dish out and settles for a murderous glower. Namjoon looks up, bewildered.</p>\n<p>Yoongi prays to every possible deity out there for Seokjin to keep his mouth shut, which is of course precisely why Seokjin <em>opens</em> his mouth and chirps, \u201cDid our Jungkookie not send you off well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s jaw drops, gaze shifting from Seokjin to Yoongi. This is why he\u2019s an atheist, Yoongi thinks sourly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t send me off with anything, he was <em>asleep</em>,\u201d Yoongi grumbles. Seokjin hums in an understanding way. Yoongi\u2019s hands itch to strangle him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d Namjoon echoes. \u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi\u2019s soulmate? The very same person sleeping in Yoongi\u2019s bed? Yep!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have grudge against me, hyung?\u201d Yoongi wonders aloud. He is ignored.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s <em>sleeping in your bed</em>?\u201d Namjoon\u2019s eyes are huge and round, and he looks like he\u2019s never seen Yoongi before in his entire life. \u201cWhat the actual fuck hyung? Just a while ago you wouldn\u2019t even <em>talk</em> about him, and now you\u2019re <em>fucking</em> him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>not</em>,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s grinds out, sharp but deadly quiet, \u201c<em>Fucking</em>. Anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon sits back and swallows. Seokjin takes pity on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi heroically rescued Jungkook from a bad situation with some angry fans yesterday. Though why he brought him home with him is anyone\u2019s guess, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was because his door didn\u2019t have a functioning lock anymore,\u201d Yoongi clips in a tone that suggests this conversation is over. Neither Namjoon or Seokjin push any further, sensing when to leave well enough alone, but Yoongi still senses the former glancing at him from time to time as they work, eyes full of questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook regains consciousness to the buzzing of his phone and with no recollection of where he is. He instantly regrets not pulling the blinds yesterday, because the amount of sunlight streaming in through the windows is way too harsh for someone that only just returned to world of the waking. He groans miserably, and fumbles for his phone. When the screen lights up he confirms that he\u2019s missed his first lecture, and that he has about a billion texts and unanswered calls from Jimin and Taehyung.</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] oh my god jungkook where are you</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] have you seen your room?</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] where the hell are you</p>\n<p>[from: taehyung] kookie where are you? we\u2019re really worried :(( pls pick up</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] they won\u2019t tell us anything wHERE ARE YOU</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] please answer</p>\n<p>[from taehyung] jimin is tearing his hair out i don\u2019t think he\u2019ll look good bald pls respond</p>\n<p>[from: taehyung] anything, just so we know you\u2019re ok</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] i\u2019ll buy you food for a week if you just pick up</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] JEON JUNGKOOK ANSWER YOUR FUCKIGN PHONE</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] IF YOU\u2019RE NOT ALREADY DEAD I\u2019M GONNA KILL YOU</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jungkook whispers to himself, all of yesterday slamming into him. He\u2019s in Suga\u2019s apartment. As quickly as he can, he fires off a text.</p>\n<p>[to: jimin, taehyung] sry, im ok. need to tlk meet @brkfast place?</p>\n<p>Immediately his phone buzzes twice in quick succession.</p>\n<p>[from: jimin] oH MY GOD</p>\n<p>[from: taehyung] ok, meet u there in 30?</p>\n<p>[to: taehyung] yeah sorry</p>\n<p>He then draws in a deep breath and slides out of bed. Still wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes and dried sweat from the dance session, he feels gross as hell.</p>\n<p>The floor is cold under his feet as he pads over to the door. After jumping up and down a few times to psych himself up, trying not to think about a possible confrontation, Jungkook carefully slides the door open and steps out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d he calls out cautiously, and then cringes at the way his voice echoes through the empty rooms. There\u2019s no response.</p>\n<p>Jungkook wanders into the kitchen. There\u2019s a post-it on the fridge with his name hastily scrawled on it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>jungkook,</em>\n<br>\n<em> @the studio. will be back tonight (?). you can stay if you want. don\u2019t do anythin weird</em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s followed by a phone number. Jungkook regards the scrap of paper, wondering what qualifies as \u201cweird\u201d. His mind provides an image of himself pulling out all the clothes in Suga\u2019s wardrobe, piling them on top of his bed and building a nest. He flushes. <em>Okay, duly noted.</em></p>\n<p>Jungkook spends a full minute engaged in a staring match with the shower cabin in the bathroom, before giving up and washing off the worst in the sink. Somehow it feels like too much of an invasion of privacy, and Suga\u2019s voice echoes in his head; <em>don\u2019t do anythin weird</em>. Taking a shower probably isn\u2019t the sort of weird Suga meant, but to Jungkook the thought of showering in the same place as Suga, possibly using his shampoo and body wash, trespasses <em>weird</em> into a whole new level of intimacy he is not ready for. Besides, Jungkook tells himself, he doesn\u2019t really have time for a shower anyway.</p>\n<p>After changing into some new clothes, he hesitates, and looks at the bag on the floor. He\u2019d packed it yesterday with what he could salvage from his room, and most of his belongings are in it. Coming to a decision, he leaves the bag behind on the floor. Suga said it was okay for him to stay here for the time being, right?</p>\n<p>Jungkook feels like a thief, hood drawn up as he sneaks outside, peeking around corners. He prays not to meet any of Suga\u2019s probably also famous, or at least rich, neighbors. Luckily, he sees no one and makes it down to the street safely. There he looks around, and it dawns on him that he has no idea where he is.</p>\n<p>Jungkook first tries googling <em>where does min suga live</em>, which in hindsight is not his brightest moment. When that proves entirely unsuccessful, he turns on the GPS on his phone. Zooming out, he sees he\u2019s in an area actually not that far from campus, but he has no idea how to get there. After another five minutes of research, he comes up with a bus stop two streets away with a line that passes by his college.</p>\n<p>Despite his rather rapid solution, this means he arrives ten minutes late to his meet up with Jimin and Taehyung. When he finally rounds the corner of the street, he can see them waiting outside. Taehyung is pacing, and Jimin is crouching on the pavement with his head in this hands. Passersby are staring at them, but the duo doesn\u2019t even seem to notice. Jungkook\u2019s heart twinges. He remembers how scared he himself felt when he first discovered his dorm. The thought of how he slept through all his hyungs\u2019 frantic attempts to contact him sends a fresh wave of guilt through his body, and he picks up the pace. Just then Taehyung spots him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook waves, and all hell breaks loose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin is still ranting ten minutes later, although his face has almost returned to normal colour and he doesn\u2019t need to gasp between his impossibly long sentences anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I\u2019m <em>sorry</em>,\u201d Jungkook tries again. \u201cI really was asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Asleep</em>, he says,\u201d Jimin grouses, pausing only to viciously tear into a scone. \u201cThis brat. Taking years off my life and he\u2019s <em>asleep</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung makes a noise of assent from where he\u2019s plastered against Jungkook\u2019s side. He hasn\u2019t let go of him once since Jungkook arrived. \u201cWhere have you been? And what happened to your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook hesitates, then begins with the story of his dorm, since that\u2019s somewhat more easy to answer. When he gets to the part where Suga shows up Jimin yells, \u201c<em>What?!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the waiters gives their table a nasty glare. Jimin misses it. Taehyung takes it upon himself to put a hand over Jimin\u2019s mouth for the rest of the story, which is probably just as well since it muffles a few other outbursts before Jungkook finishes, drained from talking for so long. Taehyung slowly removes his hand from Jimin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Too soon.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re staying at Min Suga\u2019s apartment?!</em>\u201d Jimin shouts. Every single head in the diner turns to their table. Some of the guests are straining their necks with an air of immense curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, <em>shut up!</em>\u201d Jungkook hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201dHey Kookie,\u201d Taehyung mutters as they all hunch over the table and try to act inconspicuous, \u201dare you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook is not sure it\u2019s a good idea. In fact, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a terrible idea.</p>\n<p>\u201dI know,\u201d he admits, eyes downcast. \u201dBut hyung, when am I ever gonna get another opportunity like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dWhat are you thinking?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201dMaybe I could\u2026 If we could spend some time together,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice gets progressively weaker, so the last part comes out as an unsure mumble, \u201d\u2026 maybe he\u2019d not hate me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung presses closer to him in a silent gesture of support. When Jungkook chances a glance up, Jimin\u2019s wearing his gentle smile.</p>\n<p>\u201dGonna wear him down, huh? Well, since you got the whole soulmate thing going on, I\u2019d say it\u2019s <em>meant to be</em>.\u201d Taehyung snickers from next to Jungkook\u2019s ear while Jungkook himself just heaves a long-suffering sigh. Jimin grins and playfully gives Jungkook\u2019s shoulder a light shove with his fist. \u201dPlus, he let you into his apartment, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dBut how can I know?\u201d Jungkook asks, and some of the desperation clawing at his insides must bleed through because both his hyungs instantly turn serious. \u201dHow do I know he\u2019s not just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung pats his chest, palm coming to rest above his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201dSoulbond?\u201d Jimin fills in. \u201dHeard of it? Direct link to the other person\u2019s emotions established along with the tattoo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dShut up, I <em>was</em> awake during that high school class,\u201d Jungkook grumbles, swatting at the hand.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mention how that space underneath Taehyung\u2019s warm palm feels as empty as ever. Like there\u2019s nothing to fill it. Like there never will be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Going to classes like nothing has happened is bizarre. Whenever Jungkook walks into a lecture he expects someone to point at him and shout about his dorm room, or worse, that someone will come up and stab him for not heeding their words and daring to sleep at Min Suga\u2019s place. But nothing happens, and as the day passes Jungkook\u2019s trepidation fades. Jungkook supposes the college is really keeping their word about not letting the situation get out. Naturally, there is some buzz since it\u2019s hard to hide a trashed dorm room when the door is broken, but no one seems to know anything of value. Jungkook doesn\u2019t get out much, never one to mingle, and so his only friends are Jimin and Taehyung. As a result, he keeps his head down and slips through the day without further incident.</p>\n<p>His last class of the day is together with Jimin. Jimin spends the entire lecture pelting the side of Jungkook\u2019s head with notes that just say things like \u201ci can\u2019t believe ur living at min suga\u2019s place\u2026 what\u2019s it look like\u201d, \u201chow did he even know to show up yesterday wtf\u2026. do u think he planned it??\u201d and \u201cif you steal his underwear, i bet we could sell it on the net for thousands\u201d. To which Jungkook responds with \u201ccleaner than your dorm\u201d, \u201cno\u201d and nothing, because some things are not even worth giving Park Jimin the satisfaction of answering.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really gonna be okay staying with him?\u201d Jimin asks as they\u2019re stuffing the course books into their bags at the end of the lesson. \u201cIt\u2019s the weekend now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs, and tries not to let his anxiety show on his face. \u201cBeats sleeping on the floor of <em>your</em> dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hums, contemplating. \u201cI bet Hoseok-hyung would let you sleep at the studio if you asked him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Suga-hyung throws me out, I\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Jungkook answers dryly, only half-joking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jimin utters, slinging his arm over Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, a motion that\u2019s slightly awkward considering Jungkook is taller. \u201cIf you told me two weeks ago you\u2019d be living with Min Suga, I\u2019d think you\u2019d finally snapped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook can\u2019t help but agree, even as he shrugs off Jimin\u2019s arm despite his dismayed pout. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Jimin continues, \u201cany other fan would probably kill to be where you are right now.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yeah, they\u2019d kill me</em>, Jungkook thinks, and shivers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is closing in on the location of Suga\u2019s apartment, just in the process of wondering if he should call Suga and ask when he\u2019ll be back, when he spots a slouched figure entering the apartment complex. Jungkook throws a quick glance at his surroundings, but everyone in sight are hurrying past with distant destinations in mind. He grins wildly, breaking into a sprint. He manages to catch the door just before it clicks shuts.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuga-hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suga, who is standing in front of the elevators, turns at the sound of his name being called. Jungkook skids to a stop in front of him, shoes squeaking against the floor. He doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s still smiling widely until the baffled expression on the elder\u2019s face clues him in, and he immediately schools his features into something more neutral. \u201cUh, hi,\u201d he finishes meekly.</p>\n<p>Suga raises his eyebrows, and then snorts derisively. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a dog,\u201d he says. Before Jungkook has time to decide if he\u2019s offended by that remark or not, the elevator pings and the doors slide open. Suga steps in, then tilts his head at Jungkook. \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook scrambles to get inside before the doors close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A thought hits Yoongi as he\u2019s unlocking the door, and he turns to Jungkook, scowling.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kid. Didn\u2019t I tell you to call me Yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks thrown. \u201cUm, yes\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi narrows his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear it then. What\u2019s my name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook mumbles something inaudible under his breath. Suppressing the grin that wants to surface in favour of a haughty quirk of his brow, Yoongi cups his hand around his ear, leaning closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook gets an affronted tilt to his mouth, before drawing himself up to his full height.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>said</em>,\u201d the sentence starts out strong, but then dissolves, \u201cit\u2019s, Y-Yoongi.\u201d He watches as Jungkook stumbles over the name, and then promptly turns cherry red.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like Yoongi hasn\u2019t noticed how flustered he makes Jungkook. You\u2019d have to be a fool not to. Taking advantage of this fact is probably an asshole thing to do. Too bad Yoongi\u2019s always been a bit of an asshole. He doesn\u2019t even need to try hard, and Jungkook\u2019s reactions are so rewarding.</p>\n<p>This is what makes him direct a sly smile at Jungkook. \u201cLike my name, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook blurts, and then immediately adopts a look like he wants to slap himself. Yoongi snickers under his breath. Really, too easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I like yours too. <em>Jeon Jungkookie</em>,\u201d he drawls, drawing out the nickname teasingly, then walks off into the kitchen, silently delighting in the flustered expression on the other\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Throwing open the fridge, Yoongi\u2019s pleased mood fizzes out. There\u2019s not much of anything in there, reminding him he can\u2019t recall the last time he shopped for food. Actually, he can\u2019t even remember the last time he had anything except instant noodles. He grimaces at the thought. Take out it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d, he calls out, and the other comes shuffling out of the hallway. What was it that file Seokjin compiled said\u2026 <em>anything with flour?</em> \u201cHow do you feel about pizza?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Jungkook answers. \u201cHyung, can I\u2026 borrow your shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, whatever, go ahead,\u201d Yoongi waves his hand dismissively, already dialing the number for the restaurant, almost missing Jungkook\u2019s soft thanks as he slips down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shuts the bathroom door, and immediately slumps against it, hands coming up to cover his flushed cheeks. <em>Jesus Christ, get a grip, Jeon Jungkook.</em></p>\n<p><em>Jeon Jungkookie</em>, his mind repeats, in Suga\u2019s, no, <em>Yoongi\u2019s</em>, teasing voice. Jungkook whines low in his throat. Staying here was such a bad idea. He\u2019s not gonna last an hour, much less an entire weekend.</p>\n<p>He repeats the scene in his head, complete with the mischievous spark lighting up Yoongi\u2019s eyes, and it\u2019s ridiculous, the way it makes his stomach swoop. Honestly, Jungkook had halfway managed to convince himself that Yoongi asking to be called Yoongi was actually a hallucination or a dream, conjured up by his desperate and sleep-deprived subconscious.</p>\n<p>In reminding him, Yoongi looked downright devilish and so handsome it makes Jungkook dizzy. When he grinned like that, all gums and satisfaction, Jungkook wanted to reach out. Run his fingertips down the curve of his cheek, feel the flutter of his eyelashes, taste his smile. Or even more, for Yoongi to touch <em>him</em>, with those bony fingers and warm hands\u2014Yoongi is on the other side of this door right now. Jungkook really needs to pull himself together.</p>\n<p><em>He doesn\u2019t like you</em>, he reminds himself, and it effectively puts a stop to the warm, giddy feeling bubbling up inside of him. <em>He doesn\u2019t like you</em>, he thinks with every article of clothing he removes. <em>He\u2019s just letting you stay here out of pity, or some sort of twisted responsibility. Don\u2019t go get excited over nothing all by yourself.</em></p>\n<p>He turns on the shower and steps inside, mood having plummeted to his ankles. Resting his head against the wall, he lets the water pour down over him, washing away the last remnants of happiness and pulling them down the drain. Then he straightens out and starts reading on the bottles, looking for shampoo.</p>\n<p>Carefully massaging the foam into his hair, he hums along to the song accompanying their current dance routine. The melody is easy to recreate, and he lets his voice carry throughout the chorus, humming the verses where he\u2019s unsure of the lyrics. By the time Jungkook shuts off the shower again, he feels a bit more spirited. Toweling himself dry, he pulls on his clothes, grimacing at the way the moist air causes the fabric to cling to his skin. However, the only other option is going out there in nothing but a towel, and there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen, so he\u2019ll just endure it.</p>\n<p>Stomach growling impatiently at the thought of food, he opens the bathroom door\u2014and slams straight into Yoongi, who is standing right outside.</p>\n<p>Yoongi stumbles backward, and Jungkook hastily grabs his wrist to steady him. A spark of pure electricity jumpstarts through his body, and then picks back up like the steady humming of a current. By the way Yoongi tenses, Jungkook thinks he feels it too. Yoongi\u2019s gaze darts from a point near the dip of his throat and back up at his face. Jungkook realizes with a start that he is actually taller, because at this distance, Yoongi has to tilt his head up the slightest amount to meet Jungkook\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tense moment before Jungkook lets go of Yoongi. The humming abruptly cuts off. As Yoongi\u2019s wrist drops there\u2019s a flash of dark script, and Jungkook\u2019s heart rate jumps because it\u2019s the one with his own words inscribed. His body instinctively tries to drop into bowing in apology, but the space is too restricted, so he ends up with a weird jerk of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, hyung, I\u2019m really\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were singing,\u201d Yoongi interrupts, and his gaze is piercing. Jungkook feels like all the other times Yoongi has looked at him, he\u2019s been partially seeing through him, or been distracted by some surrounding occurrence. But now, for the first time, Jungkook has Yoongi\u2019s undivided attention, and it makes his hair stand on end. \u201cIn the shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s stomach drops like a stone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, stop apologizing, you were good,\u201d Yoongi snaps impatiently. He pauses, lets out a soft sigh that Jungkook can <em>feel</em> wash over his cheeks, trailing heat in its wake. \u201d<em>Really</em> good, actually. Jungkook, you sounded <em>amazing</em>,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s chocolate brown eyes are wide and now that Jungkook looks closer, there\u2019s something awed in his slow blinking, about the tilt of his mouth. Which means Jungkook is looking at Yoongi\u2019s lips, and they\u2019re pink and parted and a little wet, and Jungkook flicks his gaze up to Yoongi\u2019s eyes again, and Yoongi is suddenly so close that Jungkook can count his eyelashes tangling together. Yoongi seems to realize at the same time Jungkook stops breathing entirely, because he flinches back.</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes the opening to squeak \u201cThanks, hyung\u201d before fleeing down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi stands alone in the hall as Jungkook disappears into his room, still holding his phone uselessly in his hand. <em>What the hell?</em> He rubs at his wrist, that\u2019s still tingling with the warmth of Jungkook\u2019s fingers wrapped around it.</p>\n<p>Yoongi feels like he\u2019s just been plunged into a frozen lake. Just recently, he had no plans of allowing Jungkook to get close to him. And now all of a sudden, he\u2019s sharing his home with him. One of his <em>fans</em>. <em>Voluntarily</em>. When he promised himself he wouldn\u2019t make that particular mistake ever again.</p>\n<p>The weight of what he\u2019s been getting into dawns on Yoongi. He doesn\u2019t even <em>like</em> human contact. Social interaction either bores or exhausts him, so why is he sharing his space with Jungkook, who is on top of everything the person he swore to stay away from?</p>\n<p>But being with Jungkook doesn\u2019t feel like<em> sharing</em> space. Young isn\u2019t going out of his way to make room for Jungkook. It\u2019s the way Jungkook just effortlessly slips into places Yoongi didn\u2019t even realize were vacant, like he belongs there. Yoongi thinks about Jungkook shouting his name and coming towards him with that ridiculously bright smile, looking happier to see him than Yoongi can recall any other person being in his life. Yoongi knows he\u2019s not that fun to be around, often too blunt and uninterested in whatever social cues he\u2019s expected to follow, but Jungkook had looked like there wasn\u2019t a single person in the entire world he\u2019d rather see than Yoongi.</p>\n<p>The worst part of it, Yoongi muses with a twinge of guilt, is that he\u2019s not deserving of it. So far, Yoongi has been awkward and teasing at best, and downright hostile at worst. He\u2019s giving Jungkook no reason to wear that expression around him, cheeks rounding and eyes scrunching up in happiness. Although Jungkook dropped it fairly quickly after he realized Yoongi was staring. Yoongi felt both disappointed and strangely relieved by that, since he\u2019s not sure what longer exposure to that fucking adorable bunny-toothed smile would do to him.</p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it ironic, Yoongi reflects wryly, how worried Yoongi was that Jungkook was going to fuck him over. So far, Yoongi has done a great job of that all on his own.</p>\n<p>The doorbell chimes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening is painfully tense. Yoongi\u2019s wrist won\u2019t stop fucking <em>tingling</em>, no matter how forcibly he rubs at the skin. Without Yoongi initiating some kind of conversation, Jungkook seems too nervous to speak up. Their only exchange is Yoongi yelling for Jungkook to come eat if he wants, and then promptly burying himself in work on the sofa. Jungkook emerges from his side of the apartment, palms nervously smoothing down the fabric of his jeans over thighs that Yoongi absolutely isn\u2019t spending more time thinking about than necessary. Jungkook\u2019s skin is still flushed from the heat of his shower. When he passes by Yoongi gets a whiff of the scent of his body wash lingering in the air around Jungkook, and fuck everything, really. Yoongi only realizes he\u2019s glaring at Jungkook\u2019s hair, silky dark strands only just starting to dry, falling softly over Jungkook\u2019s forehead, when Jungkook\u2019s fingers come up to tug at it self-consciously.</p>\n<p>The silence gets so oppressive that Yoongi turns on the television. He\u2019s not paying too much attention to which channel, so it isn\u2019t until he hears a familiar beat that he looks up. He and Namjoon are on screen, performing one of their songs. It\u2019s nothing he hasn\u2019t seen before, so he\u2019s about to go back to his work when he catches sight of Jungkook in the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is situated at the other end of the sofa, knees drawn up. His rapt attention is on the television, eyes silently following the motions. The flickering light from the television is illuminating his features. Not for the first time, Yoongi wishes he could see what he sees, not just feel what he feels, to know the reason behind it and not just the reaction. That he could pry open his head and take a look inside.</p>\n<p>Jungkook must sense his stare, because he turns his head so their eyes meet. His breath seems to stutter, but he holds Yoongi\u2019s eyes, not looking away like Yoongi thought he might. The part of his face turned away from the screen is shadowed. The apartment is silent and dark, and the noise of the television melts away.</p>\n<p>Yoongi feels as if the concept of time loses meaning. Objectively, he knows that the clock is still ticking. The cars outside are still sluggishly moving forward in their lanes, red lights glowing in the dark, flowing down the streets like syrup. It just doesn\u2019t seem to matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung,\u201d Jungkook whispers. He looks two parts reverent and one part afraid, like the moment is a frightened animal ready to bolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi acknowledges with a tilt of his head, just as lowly, eyes not straying.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t think when you look at me like that,\u201d Jungkook breathes huffily. Yoongi\u2019s lips can\u2019t help but to tilt up in a halfway smirk. He doesn\u2019t miss the way Jungkook\u2019s eyes flick to his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, not feeling very sorry at all. \u201cI was just wondering. What it is that you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s eyes are very wide. \u201cAbout...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout me,\u201d Yoongi clarifies. His skin itches, and he struggles to keep his face impassive.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t blush, or stutter like Yoongi expects. Instead he just looks down briefly as if to gather himself, before speaking. \u201cThere\u2019s this video on the internet. Of you and Rap Monster-hyung, in the studio. After you reached a new sales goal on your album.\u201d Yoongi knows which video he means. It was something recorded on Seokjin\u2019s phone, late night in the studio when both he and Namjoon were exhausted, but too hyped up on energy drinks and coffee to go home and sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two were having a rap battle,\u201d Jungkook continues, and Yoongi grins at the memory. \u201cYour accent was really obvious. You were really good, but you just looked... I guess I just thought \u2018Wow, this hyung is really cool, I want to hang out with him.\u2019\u201d Jungkook flicks his gaze up at Yoongi uncertainly, and now he\u2019s blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to hang out with me, huh?\u201d Yoongi raises his eyebrows. \u201cWell now you are, so what\u2019s the verdict? Appalled by my crumbling image? Gonna look for a new idol?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jungkook says gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can respect anyone who wants pineapple on their pizza.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s laugh is punched out of him, sharp and short, taken aback by Jungkook\u2019s nerve. \u201cDamn kid,\u201d he chortles. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been hiding that all this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Jungkook smiles innocently, eyes gleaming. Yoongi just shakes his head in disbelief.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere loosens up after that. Yoongi goes back to working, and Jungkook resumes watching the program, occasionally reacting to things by letting out small noises. It should bother Yoongi, but instead it feels strangely domestic. Losing himself in concentration, Yoongi isn\u2019t sure how much time has passed when there\u2019s a soft sound of fabric sliding against the upholstery, follow by a light thump.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has fallen asleep. The fall has brought him closer to the middle, his head resting on the cushion next to Yoongi. His cellphone is clutched loosely in his hand, display dark, tucked in against his chest. Grabbing a nearby blanket, Yoongi spreads it out over Jungkook\u2019s sleeping form. Jungkook snuffles a bit in his sleep, but doesn\u2019t wake. Yoongi has to bite down on his knuckles because how the <em>fuck</em> can anyone be that cute.</p>\n<p>Yoongi intends to return to his work once again after turning off the television, but somehow he\u2019s feeling more and more drowsy. He thinks absently that it must be the pull over the bond from Jungkook sleeping, and yawns. He\u2019ll just finish this one thing first, before going to bed\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook dreams of pine forests. The sunlight is streaming through the canopy, warming him all the way through. Yoongi is there too, eyes turning into crescent moons. In the soft, golden light he looks ethereal, and his eyes are liquid with warmth. He looks like all Jungkook has ever wanted, like home and safety. Jungkook smiles, content, and opens his eyes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s someone breathing hotly on his neck. The scent like home is still lingering in the air, wrapping around him. Jungkook goes rigid in approximately zero point two seconds.</p>\n<p>Yoongi must\u2019ve fallen asleep sitting up. In the reflection on the black TV screen, he can see Yoongi\u2019s body slumped down over Jungkook, head resting on what must be Jungkook\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing but white noise in his head. Then Yoongi stirs, turning his head, replacing the breath on his neck with something soft. Jungkook\u2019s teeth clamp down on his bottom lip, but a tiny noise still escapes his throat because <em>Yoongi\u2019s lips are on his neck</em>.</p>\n<p>Yoongi groans, and nuzzles into Jungkook\u2019s shoulder. Jungkook\u2019s pretty sure his heart actually flies out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck, it\u2019s way too early for this shit,\u201d Yoongi\u2019s voice is rough and a whole octave lower than usual and wow, Jungkook needs to leave <em>right now</em>. He presses his burning face into the cushions. His words come out muffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung?\u201d Yoongi hums. Jungkook\u2019s voice only shakes a little which is his biggest accomplishment to date, no matter what his teachers say. \u201cI need to go to the bathroom.\u201d Yoongi grumbles, but lets up when Jungkook slides his body out from under his head. Jungkook stumbles before righting himself, and walks on his shaky legs to the bathroom, where he proceeds to, very quietly, have a minor breakdown.</p>\n<p>It takes Yoongi two cups of coffee before he\u2019s awake enough to realize that he and Jungkook cuddling on the sofa in their sleep was a thing that happened. Huh. No wonder the kid seemed so freaked out all morning.</p>\n<p>He looks over at Jungkook, who is mixing his coffee with chocolate milk and honey with a concentrated look on his face, and holds back a snort. Well, it\u2019s a bit late for him to react to that shit now, and besides Jungkook seems to be doing that enough for the both of them. The influx of distressed emotion from Jungkook\u2019s end of the bond is making his heartbeat uneven, and Yoongi absentmindedly rubs the heel of his palm over his breastbone. Yoongi notices the carton of milk is trembling faintly in Jungkook\u2019s grip. Resting his cheek in his palm, Yoongi puts weight on his elbow and considers the boy on the other side of the table.</p>\n<p>Truthfully, he doesn\u2019t even know that much about Jungkook. He\u2019s painfully cute, and annoyingly tall someone four years younger. His voice is like a fucking <em>angel\u2019s</em>, he dances well enough to get genuine praise from Hoseok, and he bites his lower lip a lot. When he smiles his cheeks bunch up and his nose crinkles, he wears that one white t-shirt all the time, and apparently he can\u2019t stand the taste of bitter coffee.</p>\n<p>Yoongi thinks of Jungkook blushing, gnawing on his lip, his round eyes like those of a skittish fawn. His expression on the night his dorm was destroyed, pale and terrified. Of him smiling mischievously in the dim white light of the television in a dark room. His parted lips and flushed skin after showering, water droplets decorating his collarbones, his hair soft and wet, smelling like Yoongi.</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s voice echoes in his head. <em>You can\u2019t even make one exception? For your own soulmate?</em></p>\n<p>True, he doesn\u2019t know that much about Jungkook yet. But Yoongi is starting to realize he might want to, and, well. One way to find out.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks up from his cup.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Yoongi asks. \u201cAny plans for today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Jungkook says, spoon hanging from his mouth. \u201cNot really\u2026\u201d Then he hesitantly adds, \u201cSince I\u2019ve been missing a lot of dance lessons lately, my hyungs have agreed to help me catch up on choreography.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, right, you\u2019re a dancer,\u201d Yoongi hums noncommittally. Jungkook nods. Yoongi smirks at his unsuspecting face, before adding nonchalantly, \u201cWell, give Hoseok my best.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth it only for the double take Jungkook does just as he\u2019s about to agree, jaw dropping. Yoongi hides his snickering behind the coffee mug, taking a smug sip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou.. you know Hoseok-hyung?!\u201d Jungkook bursts out, the shock making him forget all apprehension.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, since high school,\u201d Yoongi playfully grimaces. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get rid of him after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook is still staring at him like Yoongi has just told him the Easter bunny is actually real and none other than Yoongi himself. Yoongi raises his eyebrows in amusement, staring back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he never said anything,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, would you have believed him?\u201d Yoongi challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Probably not,\u201d Jungkook amends, absentmindedly drawing shapes on the tabletop with his index finger. \u201cHoseok-hyung\u2019s a bit\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOverexcitable? Overzealous? Over the top? A bit of an idiot?\u201d Yoongi suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna say that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi grins at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you wanna come?\u201d Jungkook suddenly asks, looking stunned by his own casual question. Before Yoongi can open his mouth, Jungkook hastily adds, \u201cIt\u2019ll only be Hoseok-hyung and Jimin-hyung! He\u2019s my friend, he already knows about, um, us.\u201d As if on cue, he bites his lip, looking like he\u2019s about to tell Yoongi to forget all about it in a second.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Yoongi agrees easily. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Then, because he wouldn\u2019t be Yoongi if he didn\u2019t, he tacks on a teasing, \u201cHe knows about <em>us</em>, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook switches from relieved to mortified in two seconds flat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming here was a bad idea, Yoongi reflects from his position at the edge of the room. Jungkook really is talented. He\u2019s also very passionate, just like Hoseok had told him. Yoongi should\u2019ve payed more attention to that part.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been here barely twenty minutes, and Jungkook\u2019s honeyed skin is glistening underneath the studio spotlights. He is already sweating through his white shirt, the fabric clinging to his frame as he rolls his hips over and over. Yoongi feels a bit scandalized. Is this how the kids dance nowadays? Still, he doesn\u2019t take his eyes off Jungkook for the entire duration of the routine.</p>\n<p>When they showed up at the door, the first thing Hoseok did was to gasp and take Yoongi\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cYoongi-hyung!\u201d he screeched. \u201cIs that truly you! Out of bed before 12 AM on a Saturday! Are you dying?!\u201d Then in the middle of pinching Yoongi\u2019s scowling cheeks, he spotted Jungkook standing behind him, gaping.</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie! How come you\u2019re arriving with this grump?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Jungkook stuttered, glancing at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying with me,\u201d Yoongi cut in, glaring at Hoseok hanging off Jungkook\u2019s neck. Jungkook seemed very flustered, gaze darting back and forth between the two. Hoseok\u2019s lip curled in a sly way that caused Yoongi to narrow his eyes. \u201cNow shove off,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Hoseok sing-songed, not sounding apologetic in the least. He came back to wind his arms around Yoongi instead. Yoongi mustered a glare, that was probably somewhat ruined by the smile he felt tug at the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a day goes by where I don\u2019t regret being friends with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAha, so you do admit we\u2019re friends! Aw, you secretly love me, don\u2019t you hyung?\u201d Hoseok grinned at him, fringe falling into his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you ignore every other part of that sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright hyung, I love you too!\u201d Hoseok dragged him into the actual studio, Jungkook trailing behind. An unfamiliar guy was seated on the floor stretching. He looked up when they came through the door, then did a double take, eyes sticking to Yoongi. Yoongi figured he must be the Jimin The Friend, and greeted him with a tilt of his head. The guy nodded back, ruining the laid-back effect by looking rather shocked, and Yoongi restrained a smirk. Then Jimin\u2019s gaze traveled behind Yoongi, and he brightened considerably.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook, you bad kid!\u201d he yelled, startling Yoongi who was not prepared for the abrupt change in volume. \u201cIgnoring my texts and going off to live with another man!\u201d He scrambled up from his position from the floor and crossed his arms. \u201cWhat do you have say for yourself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung...\u201d came Jungkook\u2019s voice, sounding extraordinarily embarrassed. \u201cPlease shut up...\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin did so only after clinging to Jungkook and whining some more. It made Yoongi bristle. Why was everyone hanging off everyone all the time? What happened to keeping your damn hands to yourself? Jungkook looking like he regretted his entire existence only cheered him up moderately.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is yanked out of his reminiscing by an apparent water break. Jungkook comes ambling over, dripping of sweat. Yoongi silently extends his water bottle. Jungkook eyes it with faint surprise before taking it with a tentative smile. His bangs are plastered to his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks hyung.\u201d The sweat is pearling along his temples.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Yoongi mutters, looking away and feeling heat creep up his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t come close to me, you\u2019re really gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts into his water bottle. Yoongi glares at him. Hoseok wiggles his eyebrows in a way that says he\u2019s laughing his ass off on the inside. Yoongi growls threateningly. Jungkook looks exceedingly confused by their silent communication, until he is waved to the other side of the room by Jimin. Yoongi watches him go until Hoseok slides down next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Hoseok says, prompting Yoongi to look away from Jungkook and at him instead. \u201cLiving together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, spill,\u201d Jimin demands as soon as Jungkook comes over, yanking him down to sit next to him on the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening between you two? And why is he <em>here</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances over to where Yoongi is engrossed in a conversation with Hoseok. \u201cCan you believe Hoseok-hyung never told me he was friends with Yoongi-hyung since high school?\u201d he scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin says. \u201cNo, wait, I don\u2019t care about that. Figures Hoseok-hyung\u2019s charm would extend to celebrities. Or, <em>oooh</em>, hold on, do you think he knows Taeyang as well?\u201d Jimin gazes hopefully at him, gnawing on his lip.</p>\n<p>Jungkook levels a blank stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? It was worth asking,\u201d Jimin pouts, deflating. Then he perks up again. \u201cSo, has he explained himself yet?\u201d At Jungkook\u2019s uncomprehending look he prompts, \u201cThe weird hot and cold routine? Ditching you and then suddenly letting you live with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jungkook mumbles, picking at a loose thread in his sweatpants. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really. Talked about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gapes. \u201cWhat do you mean <em>you haven\u2019t talked about it</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what was I supposed to say then?\u201d Jungkook hisses back. \u201c\u2018Hey hyung, remember that one time you totally rejected me as your soulmate and then fucked off leaving me thinking I\u2019d never see you again? What was all that about?\u2019 Seems like a really great idea to remind the person that\u2019s currently letting me stay in their apartment that they hate me!\u201d He\u2019s breathing heavily by the end of it. Jimin looks a bit rebuffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean it like that Kookie\u2026 calm down alright?\u201d He pats him on the arm, a bit awkwardly. \u201cBut since you guys are actually soulmates\u2026 shouldn\u2019t you be able to tell what he feels? You even live together now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ice creeps through Jungkook\u2019s veins, like a spider web of frost starting in his fingertips and numbing its way into the center of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admits, eyes downcast, and to say it out loud makes his stomach lurch. Under the overhead spotlights the floor is very shiny, causing every notch and indentation to stand out more clearly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell, because there\u2019s <em>nothing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Maybe you just haven\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d Jimin offers, although he sounds a little unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe,\u201d Jungkook says bitterly, \u201cit\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t care enough to feel a single thing for me to pay attention to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s knee nudges gently against his own, and Jungkook tears his gaze from the floorboards. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. He was staring at you the entire time we were dancing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook furrows his brow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, you didn\u2019t notice? He was totally checking you out!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook flushes, almost out of habit by now. It does nothing to thaw the arctic landscape inside him. He darts a glance over to where Yoongi\u2019s still discussing something with Hoseok. \u201cStop kidding around. He probably just liked the choreography.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin raises his eyebrows in disbelief. \u201cSuuure... the <em>choreography</em>. Is that what the kids call it these days?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says quietly, biting his lip. The hand clenching around his heart is back. \u201cHe definitely doesn\u2019t like me. The only reason he\u2019s letting me stay with him is because he feels bad about making me sleep in the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Jimin concedes, sounding unconvinced. \u201cI still think you\u2019re wrong though.\u201d Then his doubtful expression morphs into an impish grin that has Jungkook eyeing him warily. \u201cHey, should I show him that video of you and TaeTae lip-syncing to <em>part 3: killer</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s jaw drops in horror. \u201cYou said you deleted that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I lied,\u201d Jimin sticks his tongue out. He makes a move to get up, and Jungkook flings himself at him, tackling the both of them to the floor. Jimin let\u2019s out an <em>oof</em>, Jungkook grappling for his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHand it over, hyung,\u201d he growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Jimin squirms, before his eyes light up with mischief. The next second, he digs his fingers into Jungkook\u2019s ribs. The boy on top of him freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDare what, Jungkookie?\u201d Jimin smirks, tickling Jungkook until he\u2019s a quivering mess, switching their positions so that he is on top of the laughing boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jungkook gasps out between breathless giggling, \u201cI\u2019m gonna, <em>haah</em>, k-kill you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kids,\u201d Hoseok yells from the other side of the room. Jimin finally stops tickling Jungkook, who flops down on the floor, panting. \u201cStop fooling around, break\u2019s over!\u201d He sounds amused.</p>\n<p>Jungkook lolls his head to the side. Hoseok is standing up again, Yoongi sitting against the wall at his feet, legs crossed. His face is unreadable. Jungkook swallows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the rest of the weekend passes without much incident. Jungkook ends up spending most of Sunday hanging out with Taehyung and Jimin, since he had promised them to go watch some new space movie Taehyung had been raving about. After the movie, which was way too confusing for Jungkook, full of wormholes and time travel and weird looking aliens, but had Taehyung so starry eyed there were practically entire galaxies in his gaze, they relocate to a fast food restaurant. Taehyung throws a french fry at Jimin when he questions some of the more intricate plot points in the movie, which naturally has their table dissolving into an all out food war that ends abruptly when they\u2019re thrown out.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t mention Yoongi or Jungkook\u2019s current living arrangements once, and for the first time since that fansign, Jungkook feels steady and not like the ground is about to crumble underneath him at any time. His cheeks ache from smiling. When he stumbles into Yoongi\u2019s apartment, covered in ketchup and sticky soda, the other perks a brow, but doesn't say anything other than \u201cYou better change out of those clothes before you go anywhere near my furniture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Yoongi-hyung,\u201d Jungkook grins obediently, still so relaxed from his outing that he barely reacts to the way Yoongi looks in the warm lamplight, soft and drowsy, oversized sweater slipping and showing off his pale collarbone.</p>\n<p>Then the week starts off again, and suddenly Yoongi disappears like he\u2019s been spirited away. On Monday morning Jungkook wakes to an empty apartment, not as much as a note. He doesn\u2019t think anything of it then, since Yoongi keeps other hours than him. When he gets back from campus, however, there\u2019s still no sign of Yoongi. Luckily, he got the key-combination off Yoongi last night, so after dawdling around in the street and attracting suspicious glances, he lets himself in. As he toes off his shoes, he tries not to think too hard about the silence in the apartment, or how the air seems to hang still and suspended.</p>\n<p>Granted, Monday is a bit of a slow day for Jungkook since he doesn\u2019t have classes the entire day, but he still feels uncomfortable wandering around Yoongi\u2019s apartment alone, surrounded by his belongings.</p>\n<p>By the time it gets dark Yoongi still isn\u2019t home. Jungkook is pacing back and forth in the hallway, ready to fling himself on the sofa and play it cool at the first sound of the door being unlocked, but it never comes. Disgruntled, he makes some cup noodles and eats them standing by the kitchen island. The apartment is so quiet that the constant ticking from the clock on the wall is driving him crazy. Jungkook gives up and goes to bed.</p>\n<p>The next day when he\u2019s getting up early for a morning class, Jungkook runs into Yoongi in the kitchen. Yoongi\u2019s eyelids are drooping, his complexion pasty and exhausted, slumped against the coffee machine. He doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s slept. Jungkook wonders if he\u2019s been out all night.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, hyung,\u201d he mumbles, rubbing sleep from his eyes.</p>\n<p>It looks like it takes a massive amount of effort just for Yoongi to raise his head. \u201cAh, Jungkook-ah,\u201d he says, sending a tingle down Jungkook\u2019s spine. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d His voice sounds like it\u2019s being dragged over gravel.</p>\n<p>Jungkook grumbles something about an early class, and then his toast pops up. Yoongi hands him the first cup of coffee and Jungkook downs half of it in one go, despite the fact that the temperature is only just below scalding, grimacing at the taste. He hands the cup back to Yoongi, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. \u201cThanks, Yoongi-hyung,\u201d he mutters around the toast hanging from his mouth, stepping into his shoes and throwing his bag over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cStudy hard,\u201d Yoongi calls out after him before the door shuts.</p>\n<p>Wednesday, Jungkook doesn\u2019t see Yoongi at all. When he dares a peek into Yoongi\u2019s bedroom, feet firmly planted behind the threshold because anything else would feel like a breach of privacy, the sheets are messed up like someone slept there. The blinds are pulled, shrouding the room in darkness even though the sun hasn\u2019t gone down yet, and there\u2019s no sign of Yoongi. Then again, Jungkook doesn\u2019t know how often Yoongi bothers to actually make his bed after sleeping in it. He doesn\u2019t seem the type.</p>\n<p>The silence is like a tangible presence, and it picks at the edges of Jungkook\u2019s mind until his thoughts feel raw. He plugs his phone into Yoongi\u2019s impressive hifi speaker system, and plays music so loudly it\u2019s a wonder the neighbours don\u2019t come knocking. Jungkook slides down the hallways on his socks. He walks around on his hands until it feels like his head is about to explode from the blood rushing to his brain. He\u2019s practically daring Yoongi to walk in on him in the midst of his aggressive Linkin Park lip syncing, embarrassing air guitar playing and overexcitable jumping to boot. But by the time Jungkook collapses in a panting heap on the shiny hardwood floor, Yoongi still hasn\u2019t come home.</p>\n<p>By Thursday Jungkook has taken to studying in the library to avoid having to come home to an empty flat. Jimin joins him, despite whining the entire time about how boring the library is and doodling on the table when the librarian isn\u2019t looking. Jungkook honestly makes an effort to concentrate, but the thoughts are swirling in his head and he slams his textbook shut, dropping his head on top of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s avoiding me,\u201d he mumbles into the cover.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuga-hyung?\u201d Jimin wonders. He\u2019s abandoned the doodling and produced a bag of salty snacks, throwing peanuts high in the air and catching them with his mouth. \u201cNah, he\u2019s probably just busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Jungkook asks, feeling like a petulant grade schooler and hating himself for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCelebrity stuff?\u201d Jimin suggests. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in the studio recording.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deep down Jungkook knows that what Jimin just said makes sense, but there\u2019s a more insistent part that he can\u2019t shake, saying it\u2019s because Jungkook is in his house. He dunks his head against the top of the book.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even come home last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s a workaholic,\u201d Jimin says, absentmindedly patting his head. Jungkook shakes him off, agitated. \u201cStop beating yourself up over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s nice of him to say and all, but ever since Jimin brought up that meeting at the caf\u00e9, Jungkook can\u2019t stop thinking about it. He\u2019ll sit at home staring at the clock, hearing Yoongi\u2019s voice saying <em>\u201cWe\u2019re what?\u201d</em> in that freezing tone. More and more, he\u2019s starting to question this whole thing. He\u2019s nothing but an annoyance to Yoongi. When Yoongi offered to let Jungkook stay with him, didn\u2019t he retract his offer immediately afterwards? Told Jungkook to forget about it? But of course Jungkook latched onto it, forced Yoongi to let him into his home, like a pathetic, obsessed fan.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon, Jungkook gets a call from management. His dorm room is fixed, he can move back in starting next week. Jungkook hangs up feeling numb. Well, this is it. Yoongi will finally be rid of him, and they\u2019ll probably never see each other again. Everything will go back to how it was before. Yoongi will stop being Yoongi and start being Suga again, famous and untouchable, miles out of Jungkook\u2019s reach. And Jungkook will go back to being Jungkook the miserable fanboy. Just the thought of being back in the dark in front of his computer, watching video after video of Yoongi smiling, laughing, and knowing this is as close as he\u2019ll ever get, is like a stab in the gut. Flashing before his eyes is Yoongi curled on the couch with his battered notebook, brow furrowed and tongue peeking out, Yoongi glaring at Hoseok hanging off his shoulders, Yoongi raising his eyebrows with an amused smile tugging at his lips, Yoongi, Yoongi, <em>Yoongi</em>. Jungkook blinks to soothe the stinging behind his eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay. Once he moves out, Yoongi can finally come home again and sleep properly. Jungkook tells himself this as he crawls into bed, pressing his face into the pillow. <em>It\u2019s okay</em>, he thinks even as his throat aches and the fabric under his eyes turns moist. It\u2019s okay, because Yoongi will be happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as he gets out of bed the next morning, Jungkook starts to collect his things. It\u2019s no use dragging it out, he shouldn\u2019t bother Yoongi anymore. His toothbrush on the sink in the bathroom, his hoodie slung over the back of a chair, his Timberlands tangled with Yoongi\u2019s beat up Converse in the hallway. Jungkook spends some time marveling at how many of his things have managed to find themselves unto the floor of the bedroom in such a short amount of time. Lastly, he makes the bed as well as he can, and then stands there staring at a corner of the smoothed out comforter.</p>\n<p>Yoongi still isn\u2019t home. Jungkook should at least tell him he\u2019s leaving, so Yoongi knows it\u2019s okay to come home again. He takes out his phone and brings up his contacts.<em> Suga-hyung</em>, the number is timidly named. Jungkook changes it to <em>Yoongi</em>. It\u2019s not like it matters anyway because Yoongi will probably never contact him again after this, but Jungkook would like to cling to this familiarity, if only for his own sake. He remembers how he stared at the contact when he first put it in, unable to believe this was actually real life. Part of him wanted to brag about it on every single social media platform he\u2019s part of. <em>I\u2019m the guy Min Suga gave his phone number to.</em></p>\n<p>Jungkook dials the number, and bites down on his lip as the signals echo, one after another. Yoongi isn\u2019t picking up. Jungkook scowls fiercely to distract himself from his stomach turning itself inside out. Is Yoongi sick of him to the point where he can\u2019t even bring himself to pick up when Jungkook calls?</p>\n<p>He tries again, and then again. No answer. Jungkook is about to give up when he remembers that manager who called him once. Jungkook never bothered to save the number, but there it sits in his call log.</p>\n<p>Seokjin picks up on the third ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, this is Kim Seokjin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jungkook stutters. \u201cIt\u2019s Jungkook, I don\u2019t know if you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d, Seokjin exclaims, sounding surprised but not unhappy. \u201cOf course I remember! Why are you calling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook decides straightforward is the way to go. \u201cUm, do you know where Yoongi-hyung is? I tried calling him, but he didn\u2019t pick up...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yeah, he\u2019ll do that,\u201d Seokjin chuckles over the line. \u201cHe and Namjoon have been practically living in the studio this past week\u2026 It\u2019s impossible to stop them when they get in the zone. You\u2019ll have to come over, I\u2019ll give you the address.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d Jungkook starts but Seokjin is already rattling off an address and Jungkook fumbles for a pen.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014just tell them that you\u2019re Jungkook and I sent you, and they\u2019ll let you in!\u201d Seokjin finishes cheerily. \u201cSee you soon!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d Jungkook gets out and then stares at his phone as Seokjin hangs up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the studio door creaks open Yoongi doesn\u2019t look up, thinking it\u2019s Namjoon returning from fetching that drink he was talking about. However, the only sound is that of shoes shuffling against the floor, and no Namjoon drops into the chair next to him. Yoongi frowns and glances up.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is standing just past the doorway, biting his lip. Yoongi\u2019s gaze is drawn to the flash of white teeth, transfixed by the way they\u2019re digging into Jungkook\u2019s plump bottom lip. He blinks, before shaking his head once to dissolve the thoughts stagnating in his tired mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The boy drags the sole of his shoe against the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI called your manager and he said I should come here,\u201d Jungkook offers, taking a few hesitant steps into the room, eyes flying from the controls to the small table littered with empty bags of chips and noodle cups. \u201cI\u2014\u201d, he cuts off, gaze locking on something above Yoongi\u2019s eyes. \u201cIs that my beanie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi drags off the soft hat on top of his head and looks at it. The fabric is a dark shade of red that is, when he thinks about it, not familiar. \u201cActually, might be. Sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Jungkook hastens to get out. \u201cI like it,\u201d he admits quietly, cheeks colouring. Yoongi opens his mouth, not entirely sure what he\u2019s about to answer. He doesn\u2019t find out, because just then Namjoon appears in the doorway behind Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2014\u201d he begins, a frown creasing his brow, and Jungkook turns toward the sound. \u201cOh. Jungkook, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks starstruck, mouth open and eyes huge. Namjoon sticks out his hand. \u201cKim Namjoon,\u201d he says, smiling charmingly at Jungkook, dimples deepening. \u201cCall me Namjoon. Nice to meet you.\u201d Jungkook grasps the offered hand like he\u2019s convinced it\u2019s a hallucination and isn\u2019t sure even when his fingers wrap around Namjoon\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, nice to meet you, Namjoon-hyung,\u201d he stammers, and Yoongi bristles because why does Namjoon get to be <em>Namjoon-hyung</em> after literally two seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cNamjoon,\u201d Yoongi snaps, and something on his face makes Namjoon do a double take before he gets a smug look in his eye, gaze flickering to Jungkook. Yoongi gets a sudden urge to punch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you come to hang out, Jungkook-ah?\u201d Namjoon asks, voice smooth the way it always is when he\u2019s being <em>nice</em> to the fans, and it hasn\u2019t ever bothered Yoongi before, but now he\u2019s vaguely aware he\u2019s clutching the water bottle in his hand so hard it\u2019s starting to cave in. \u201cKnow anything about music producing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly a little,\u201d Jungkook says, looking a bit stunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should help out then!\u201d Namjoon suggests brightly, and Yoongi stares because since when is Namjoon so keen to drag others into their recording process? \u201cYou\u2019re a fan? We could use a fan\u2019s opinion. Right, Yoongi-hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yoongi says through clenched teeth. Jungkook loses a bit of the awed expression and looks uncomfortable instead, glancing from Namjoon to Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could leave,\u201d he starts hesitantly, but Yoongi cuts him off with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, you might as well\u2026 Come here,\u201d he pats the seat next to him, scooting over to make way and ignoring Namjoon\u2019s obnoxious winking behind Jungkook\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jungkook says as the beat is slowly dying, fading away. Yoongi groans and scrubs his hands viciously through his hair, dislocating the beanie in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with this one,\u201d he admits, frustrated. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks and I can\u2019t figure out how to fix this track.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Jungkook protests, seeming hasty to defend Yoongi, even to himself. \u201cThe rap parts are amazing! Maybe\u2026 have you considered adding vocals?\u201d Yoongi snaps his gaze to Jungkook, who seems to shrink a little under the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe thought about it, but...\u201d Namjoon shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of finding the right voice, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook says meekly. What a stupid thing to say, of course they\u2019ve considered vocals. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi cuts in. \u201cIt\u2019s a decent suggestion, though we\u2019d have to make space for it, and maybe rearrange the parts at that place....\u201d He dissolves into mumbling to himself.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is still winded by the fact that he\u2019s sitting in a studio with Yoongi and Namjoon, listening to their unreleased tracks and being asked for his opinion. He manages to give one or two astute pointers, but mostly he feels like he\u2019s in way over his head. When Yoongi gets a manic glint in his eyes and Namjoon starts to lean forward, the two of them shooting ideas back and forth so quickly Jungkook has trouble even keeping up, he retreats to the sofa to watch silently. The two hardly even notice, completely absorbed in their discussion. Jungkook is amazed by how in tune they seem, entirely riding the same wavelength.</p>\n<p>The sofa is comfortable, and it\u2019s not long before Jungkook\u2019s eyelids are growing heavy. He snuggles into the cushions, intending only to nap for a bit, but he finds himself drifting deeper and deeper, lulled to sleep by the mumble of voices.</p>\n<p>At one point he swears he can feel someone\u2019s chilly hand on his forehead, pushing his fringe out of his eyes and stroking it back. He turns into the touch, sighing, halfway between dreams and consciousness. His head feels as if it\u2019s stuffed full of cotton.</p>\n<p>Someone gives a chuckle. \u201cSo you actually do like him after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he can make out Yoongi\u2019s voice, sounding much closer than the other. Jungkook wrinkles his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi,\u201d he sighs, and the hand stills. Jungkook\u2019s eyelids flutter, and then the steady movement picks up again, carefully smoothing over his temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, Jungkook-ah,\u201d Yoongi says, low and soothing, and Jungkook relaxes again. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Jungkook slips back into the darkness.</p>\n<p>What feels like only a few minutes later, a hand is shaking his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d and Jungkook groans and buries his face into something warm and soft that smells <em>amazing</em>. The voice is amused. \u201cJeon Jungkookie, wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, wanna stay here,\u201d Jungkook slurs. \u201cSmells good.\u201d The soft, warm thing he\u2019s snuggling into vibrates in a laugh. <em>What?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I smell good?\u201d Jungkook flies upright on the sofa, narrowly avoiding knocking heads with Yoongi, who is kneeling next to it, and wow, Jungkook has embarrassed himself once again.</p>\n<p>His entire face is probably splotchy red. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Yoongi cuts him off, echoing Jungkook\u2019s earlier words back at him with a small grin. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s heart is beating so hard he can feel it all the way to his fingertips. He stares at Yoongi, frozen. What does that mean? Why would Yoongi like that? But then Yoongi turns away, standing up and stretching his limbs and the moment is broken. His hoodie rides up and reveals a sliver of pale, smooth tummy that Jungkook\u2019s eyes are glued to until it disappears back underneath the fabric again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty late,\u201c Yoongi says. \u201cYou were out for a while.\u201d He glances at Jungkook and for a second there\u2019s something in his eyes that Jungkook doesn\u2019t dare to name. Then it\u2019s gone again, maybe just something imagined, and Yoongi\u2019s shrugging into his jacket. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says, and Jungkook follows him out the door, swaying on his feet.</p>\n<p>Outside the sky is darkening, and their breaths escape their mouths in clouds of white mist. Yoongi hunches into his jacket, hands shoved deep into the pockets. Jungkook shivers. The temperature wasn\u2019t as low when he walked here earlier, and the contrast between the heated studio and the chilly outside chases the last vestiges of sleep from his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it okay, for us to walk?\u201d Jungkook finds himself asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi replies, voice getting muffled as he fixes the mask covering his mouth and nose. He cuts a glance at Jungkook from the corner of his eye. \u201cKeep your head down and stay close, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>They fall into step side by side. At first the streets are quiet and deserted, but as they approach the more central areas it starts getting crowded. Jungkook drifts closer to Yoongi\u2019s side, trying to keep his head down while anxious not to lose him among the other people. Then he feels a tug at his sleeve. For a heartstopping moment, Jungkook thinks a stranger has grabbed him, that they\u2019ve been recognized, but when he looks down the hand belongs to Yoongi. He\u2019s gripping the fabric of Jungkook\u2019s jacket securely. He\u2019s not wearing any mittens, and his knuckles are turning red from the cold. Before Jungkook registers what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s pried Yoongi fingers loose and enveloped them in his own hand.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s palm is slack in his. Jungkook stares at their joined hands with a sort of detached horror. He\u2019s finally done it now, Yoongi is going to shove him away, tell him to never touch him again\u2014</p>\n<p>Yoongi does none of these things. Jungkook almost jumps out of his skin when he feels icy fingers fold over his on, and he snaps his head up. Yoongi\u2019s eyes are fixed on the road ahead of them, and Jungkook can\u2019t tell if his cheeks are red from the cold or something else.</p>\n<p>Worst of all\u2014except for his own heart pounding violently inside his chest, Jungkook can\u2019t feel a thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stumble into the hallway, still connected. Yoongi can\u2019t help but grin. Jungkook looks <em>endearing</em>, flushed to the tips of his ears, tufts of his dark hair sticking up. It\u2019s like a piece of a puzzle slots into place inside of Yoongi, fitting perfectly into a space he wasn\u2019t aware existed.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d he murmurs, eyes locked on Jungkook\u2019s. He tugs him closer by their joined hands, and Jungkook stumbles forward a step. With his free hand, Yoongi reaches up, stroking Jungkook\u2019s bangs out of his eyes in the echo of a gesture from a dream. \u201cYour hair\u2019s a mess. Aiming for the bad boy look, Jeon Jungkookie?\u201d he asks teasingly, thumb smoothing over the soft skin just beneath his eyebrow. Jungkook\u2019s own hand comes up, fingers closing around Yoongi\u2019s wrist like a brand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you,\u201d he begins, voice hoarse. \u201cAre you toying with me, hyung?\u201d Yoongi frowns. There\u2019s a downset to Jungkook\u2019s mouth, and he\u2019s biting the inside of his cheek. Even through the jacket, Yoongi can make out the tense line of his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you even asking that?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice is trembling with accusation, with <em>hurt</em>, and Yoongi gets the sudden impression that this entire conversation is barreling out of control. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like this. You don\u2019t even like me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi goes slack with surprise. Distantly, he\u2019s aware of his wrist slipping out of Jungkook\u2019s grasp as he stares at him, mouth dry. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence is oppressive. Jungkook loosens their handhold, stepping away. Yoongi\u2019s fingers instinctively curl up, but there\u2019s nothing to grasp at.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy room is fixed,\u201d Jungkook tells Yoongi\u2019s sneakers. Yoongi blinks, brain furiously trying to catch up with all these revelations. \u201cI only came to the studio to tell you. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he bends down and picks up a bag Yoongi hadn\u2019t noticed before. All the air is punched out of Yoongi\u2019s lungs, the hallway tilts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook says nothing, just slings the bag over his shoulder, turning toward the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, what,\u201d Yoongi manages, and his calm voice is nothing like his mind. His hand shoots out and grasps Jungkook\u2019s shoulder, spinning him around so they\u2019re facing each other. Jungkook swallows, but stays silent. His eyes are flicking rapidly over Yoongi\u2019s face, like he\u2019s trying to drink in everything at once, trying to burn every slope of his face into memory. Yoongi stares back. Jungkook has a small scar on his cheek, a streak of pale against the tan shade of his skin. Yoongi can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been there all this time, and he never noticed it until now. How could he not notice?</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah,\u201d the name comes out on an exhale, and Jungkook shudders. Yoongi can feel it pass through him underneath the palm of his hand. Yoongi slides his fingers from Jungkook\u2019s shoulder over the jut of his collarbone, coming to rest just above his heart. The same place where Yoongi can feel his own heart beating, every pulse of it enough to bruise. \u201cCan\u2019t you\u2026 Don\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook gives him a small, humorless tug of a smile. \u201cFeel what, hyung?\u201d He shakes off Yoongi\u2019s hand, and this time Yoongi lets it fall.</p>\n<p>Jungkook leaves. Yoongi watches the door swing shut behind him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook raps his knuckles against the hard surface of the studio door, sniffling into his sleeve. His nose is running. It\u2019s just the cold, that\u2019s all.</p>\n<p>Hoseok opens the door with a frown on his face. \u201cJungkook-ah? What are you doing here? Where\u2019s\u2014\u201d he falls silent as soon as he gets a closer look at Jungkook\u2019s face, eyes widening.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says, and his voice breaks on the word, splinters in his throat. \u201cHyung, please let me stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok lets him in without a word. Only when Jungkook is settled on a makeshift bed made out of a few foam rubber mats and jackets, Hoseok asks, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook fidgets, but stays silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna tell me?\u201d Hoseok raises his eyebrows, and pulls out his phone, thumb hovering over the screen. \u201cShould I call Yoongi-hyung and ask him then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jungkook bursts out loudly. \u201cNo, don\u2019t call him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Hoseok says, lowering the phone but not putting it back in his pocket. \u201cGonna tell me what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Jungkook starts up a mumbling recount of the events of the day. By the time he finishes his eyes are glued to the jacket he\u2019s clutching in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Jungkook,\u201d Hoseok sighs and he sounds so sad that Jungkook risks a glance up and his jaw drops.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell hyung? Are you <em>crying?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok punches Jungkook in the shoulder. \u201cShut up you brat, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s just <em>tragic</em>,\u201d he snivels wetly and Jungkook instinctively crinkles his nose in disgust, rubbing the sore spot on his arm, \u201chow stupid you both are. No wonder you\u2019re soulmates, you guys are obviously destined for each other. Oh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d Jungkook says defensively. Hoseok gives him a look of pity that probably isn\u2019t entirely unlike the expression doctors don while telling someone they have an incurable disease.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Hoseok begins, enunciating each word very carefully as if explaining some obvious fact to a child. \u201cIf Yoongi-hyung truly didn\u2019t care about you <em>at all</em>, why would he hold your hand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>know!</em>\u201d Jungkook explodes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand! First he outright rejects me, then he lets me live in his house! And then he just <em>leaves</em> again! I thought he felt bad about my dorm, but he kept being so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off, not knowing how to put it into words. How should he describe that look Yoongi had directed at him in the studio? Or how Yoongi\u2019s eyes would sometimes flick to his lips and linger there for entirely too long? Or the teasing lilt of his voice calling him, soft and sly; <em>Jeon Jungkookie</em>.</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s watching him with a small amount of sympathy. Jungkook must seem so pathetic right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree he could\u2019ve been a bit more forthcoming about this entire thing, but then again Yoongi-hyung has always been an \u2018actions speak louder than words\u2019 kinda guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jungkook demands, fed up with everyone talking in riddles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi likes you,\u201d Hoseok says, point blank. Jungkook\u2019s expression immediately falls.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Hoseok splays his hands out in incredulity. \u201cWhy are you so convinced of that? Has he ever told you so explicitly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say Yoongi-hyung is more of an \u2018actions speak louder than words\u2019 kinda guy?\u201d Jungkook mocks. \u201cTrust me, it showed. And he even said he\u2019d never date a fan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Hoseok says, leaning back and putting weight on his hands placed behind him on the studio floor. \u201cI suppose he didn\u2019t mention anything about that either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMentioned <em>what?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok shifts, looking vaguely uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should tell you this, but then again, you do deserve to know... \u201c He sighs, looking up at Jungkook. \u201cYoongi-hyung once dated a fan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares. \u201cWhat? I never\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok gives him a wry smile. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly a public thing, which is probably the only fortunate thing about it. It\u2026 it didn\u2019t end very well. Yoongi-hyung was pretty messed up about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook almost feels scared to breathe. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok gives him a pointed look. \u201dIf you want the details you should probably ask Yoongi-hyung about that, not me. Anyway, it was after that he made that rule about not dating fans. He stuck to it religiously too, but from the sound of it, I guess he\u2019s discarded it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDiscarded it?\u201d Jungkook asks, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hoseok rolls his eyes. \u201cSince he started to get to know <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook opens his mouth protest again, but Hoseok frowns like he\u2019s just realized something else and asks, \u201cHold on. You and Yoongi are soulmates, and you\u2019ve been really close to each other for a while now. Couldn\u2019t you feel it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook swallows, memory of Yoongi\u2019s palm flat on his chest. <em>Don\u2019t you feel it?</em> \u201cNot a thing,\u201d he confesses bitterly. Hoseok stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Okay,\u201d he admits reluctantly, uncertainty flickering across his features for the first time, \u201cI can see why that would throw you off\u2026 What about Yoongi though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid <em>he</em> feel anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck should I know? It\u2019s not like I <em>asked</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to see that\u2019s not your strong suit,\u201d Hoseok remarks. \u201cDid you guys even exchange words at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook retorts snidely, \u201cI was kind of busy having my own feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, no need to get so defensive! I\u2019m just saying all of this might be a misunderstanding\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook glares into his lap. Of course, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s fucked up again. There probably wasn\u2019t even anything to notice. You know, since Yoongi doesn\u2019t give a shit about him.</p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a while. Jungkook\u2019s thoughts keep going in circles, always returning to Yoongi. What he\u2019s doing. What he\u2019s thinking about. What he\u2019s feeling. Isn\u2019t it funny, how Jungkook\u2019s still just as clueless about that when Yoongi is on the other side of town, as Jungkook was when he was staying right by his side?</p>\n<p>\u201dYou do know,\u201d Hoseok starts off, contemplative, \u201dthat it\u2019s possible to reject a soulbond, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dI figured, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot Yoongi-hyung, I\u2019m saying what if <em>you</em> rejected it?\u201d Taking a look at Jungkook\u2019s expression, Hoseok hastens to elaborate. \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t let him in first, it\u2019s impossible to feel anything. Let\u2019s be real, how many reasons has Yoongi-hyung really given you to trust him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jungkook scowls, but falters. Hoseok watches him with dawning understanding, and it makes Jungkook\u2019s skin crawl. He rubs a palm over his forearm, like it\u2019ll make the itch of the tattoo disappear. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I think he\u2019ll murder me in my sleep or anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s called being a decent human being, Jungkook-ah,\u201d Hoseok points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe.. He was nice to me?\u201d Jungkook tries, but there\u2019s an ugly feeling creeping into his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, <em>also</em> called being a decent human being. Besides, you thought he only did that out of obligation and not because he wanted to, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jungkook wants to deny it, tell Hoseok he\u2019s wrong, but he finds himself asking the only thing on his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes, Jungkook-ah,\u201d Hoseok tells him gently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi takes the stairs two at a time. He is hit by a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as he climbs upwards, bowing his head and pulling his cap down more firmly as he\u2019s passed by a student hugging five books to their chest and muttering to themselves under their breath. They don\u2019t even seem to notice elbowing Yoongi as they move past, and he lets out a quiet breath.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange, how this place seems colored by the urgency from his memories. His feet instinctively want to speed up, to tear down the hallway like it\u2019s a matter of life and death this time around as well. Yoongi forces himself to slow his pace. The squeaks his sneakers make against the floor feel impossibly loud, every single sound amplified in the deserted corridor. Yoongi is struck by the sudden thought that everyone on the other side of the walls must be able to hear the heavy thump of his heartbeat as he passes by.</p>\n<p>He stops before one of the doors. It looks exactly the same as the others, except when Yoongi pays attention the lock looks shinier, like it\u2019s new. Taking another calming breath, he raises his hand to knock.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi whirls around. There\u2019s a guy leaning on the wall opposite, arms crossed over his chest. It takes a second for Yoongi to recognize him as Jimin from Jungkook\u2019s dance lesson. The emotionless expression on his face contrasts sharply with the boyish smile from Yoongi\u2019s memory, eyes turned up into crescent moons. Those same eyes are now regarding him coldly.</p>\n<p>Yoongi slowly lowers his hand, somehow feeling like he should be raising both instead, palms up in a \u201cdon\u2019t shoot\u201d gesture. \u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a split second Jimin\u2019s features twist, but they smooth out before Yoongi can get a real read on the emotion concealed. \u201cYes,\u201d Jimin answers flatly, without elaborating.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Yoongi says, but doesn\u2019t press. Instead he asks, voice deceivingly calm while his heart is beating out of his chest, \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>The carefully blank expression on Jimin\u2019s face crumples. Yoongi is entirely unprepared for what comes next.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>fucking bastard</em>,\u201d Jimin hisses, eyes blazing with fury as he stalks toward Yoongi. \u201c\u2018How is he?\u2019 <em>How is he?</em> You think you can just show up here and ask <em>how he is?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi flinches backwards when Jimin gets up in his face. They\u2019re about the same height, which means it shouldn\u2019t be intimidating, but the sheer intensity of Jimin\u2019s expression is enough to make up for it. He stabs a finger at Yoongi\u2019s chest, almost causing him to stumble backwards from the force behind the gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou supreme asshole,\u201d he spits. A fleck of it hits Yoongi\u2019s cheek as he stares, wide-eyed and taken off-guard. \u201cDo you even <em>know</em> how much you\u2019ve hurt Jungkook? How many times you made him cry? You don\u2019t deserve to know <em>shit</em> about him, least of all <em>how</em> <em>he is</em>.\u201d He punctures the last three words by poking Yoongi in the chest again, hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminnie?\u201d a voice asks from behind Jimin\u2019s back. \u201cWho\u2019re you yelling at?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin breaks off his glare to turn around, and another guy appears in Yoongi\u2019s line of sight. He notices how the faintly puzzled look hardens as soon as the guy lays eyes on Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s about to ask \u201cHave we met?\u201d because the guy is glaring at him with such open distaste, but before he gets the chance, the guy moves up next to Jimin and slings an arm around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he tells Jimin casually, like Yoongi isn\u2019t even there. \u201cI\u2019ve never punched anyone in my life before... so I\u2019m not really sure how you do it, but,\u201d he pauses and grins suddenly, turning to Yoongi, \u201cit can\u2019t be that difficult, can it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin snorts, even though anger is still evident in every hardened line of his frame. \u201cYou\u2019d probably hurt your hand, don\u2019t bother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you think so?\u201d the guy relents, pouting slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d Yoongi gets out, staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Taehyung,\u201d they guy presents cheerfully, hand forming a v-sign next to his face. Although his actions are borderline silly, there\u2019s something harsh in the glint of his eyes. \u201cDid our Jungkookie not tell you about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yoongi mutters, and it\u2019s like admitting defeat. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin raises an eyebrow. \u201cGuess you can\u2019t have been that close then,\u201d he says, and God, that stings.</p>\n<p>Taehyung tugs at Jimin\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHey, let\u2019s go,\u201d he says. \u201cI want ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, alright,\u201d Jimin agrees easily. \u201cBetter leave before someone recognizes you,\u201d he throws at Yoongi over his shoulder before they start walking away.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s throat is so dry he has to forcibly swallow twice before the words make it past his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he calls out after them, and it comes out a little rough, a little desperate. They both stop, turning back. Yoongi clears his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cHow much I\u2019ve hurt him.\u201d He clenches his fists in frustration and helplessness. He wonders absentmindedly if Jungkook can feel it, before he remembers that Jungkook can\u2019t feel anything at all. \u201cBut I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d he manages to wrangle out, throat closing up as he practically has to rip the words out of his chest.</p>\n<p>Both Jimin and Taehyung watch him silently for a while. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a mess,\u201d Jimin says at last, but the anger is smoothed from his brow. Yoongi doesn\u2019t deny it. \u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve told him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to. I would, if he\u2019d pick up my calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin and Taehyung share a glance that makes Yoongi wonder if telepathy is an actual thing nowadays.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease hold,\u201d Taehyung intones in his deep voice, \u201cand we will be with you in a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Jimin then turn their backs on Yoongi once more, arms over the other\u2019s shoulder and heads ducked closely together. Yoongi can do nothing but stare in incredulity as they proceed to have what looks like a whispered two-man conference. After a minute or so of furious hissing, they nod decisively, narrowly avoiding knocking their foreheads together, and straighten up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin fixes Yoongi with a stare. \u201cWe have agreed to hear you out and give you another chance, on one condition\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014You buy us ice cream,\u201c Taehyung fills in, nodding sagely with arms crossed over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is how he finds himself seated across from two college kids he barely knows, staring at the piled-up mountain of ice cream on the table. Yoongi\u2019s starting to wonder if all these meet-ups with youngsters are gonna become a routine in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s winter,\u201d Yoongi remarks, still eyeing the amount of ice cream with a wrinkled nose.</p>\n<p>Taehyung pays him no mind, eyes closed in bliss. Only Jimin pauses, spoon halfway to his mouth. \u201cYeah, what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi rolls his eyes. \u201cNevermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dOkay,\u201d Taehyung\u2019s words are muffled around the spoon in his mouth. \u201dWe\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi sighs, scrubbing a hand across his face. \u201dWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dWell, you could always begin by explaining how you caused Jungkook, the person who spends way too much time coming up with excuses for your behavior, to run away from the one thing he wants above all. Which is, coincidentally,\u201d Jimin rudely points the spoon at Yoongi\u2019s scowling face, \u201dto be with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dI would if I knew that myself,\u201d Yoongi counters, frustration making his tone snappier than he would like. \u201dMaybe you could explain why he seems so dead set on thinking I don\u2019t like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung and Jimin both pause.</p>\n<p>\u201dYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d They exchange doubtful glances. \u201dRemember that time you met with him only to tell him that you wouldn\u2019t ever date him, based solely on the reason that he liked your music? Why is that even? Do you have something against people enjoying your work? That\u2019s just plain bizarre to me considering your profession.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dThat\u2019s personal,\u201d Yoongi clips, in a voice that brooks no argument.</p>\n<p>Jimin considers him coldly for a minute, before leaning back again. \u201dFair enough. But you gotta admit your first meeting was pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi shifts uncomfortably in the plastic chair. The entire interior of the ice cream parlor is making him feel way out of his comfort zone. It\u2019s too colorful, and\u2026 cheery. \u201dThat was a long time ago,\u201d he defends. \u201dThings changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Taehyung challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike the way I felt,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cThe way I feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t cross your mind that what Jungkook felt also might change, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s jaw clenches, but he can\u2019t exactly protest, because it\u2019s true. While Yoongi was too busy trying to come to terms with whatever leftover ghosts from his past, he didn\u2019t spare a thought to what the waiting might do to Jungkook. Didn\u2019t even reach out once. Yoongi thinks of the look of betrayal on Jungkook\u2019s face, his glittering eyes and voice full of thorns (<em>Feel</em> what, <em>hyung?</em>), a whole world of hurt Yoongi didn\u2019t notice, and his ribs crowd in around his lungs like a prison.</p>\n<p>\u201dHe said he couldn\u2019t feel a thing,\u201d Yoongi reluctantly admits, trying to ignore the dull throb of his heart. He turns his gaze toward the window to avoid the stares from the other side of the table. \u201dIf you kids could explain that, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dThere is a theory,\u201d Taehyung confides, eyes observing Yoongi carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201dIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Jimin hedges. \u201dIt\u2019s just what Hoseok-hyung thinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dJung Hoseok?\u201d Yoongi questions, back straightening. Jimin and Taehyung seem to flounder for the first time underneath his sharp gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201dUh, yeah?\u201d Then understanding seems to dawn on Jimin\u2019s face, \u201dOh, I forgot that you\u2026 know him\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dSo he knows where Jungkook is?\u201d Yoongi fires off, leaning further in over the table.</p>\n<p>\u201dUh, yes\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dGreat. Thanks kids,\u201d Yoongi stands up. \u201dYou\u2019ve been real helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, at least stay until you\u2019ve answered one more question, okay?\u201d Jimin frowns disapprovingly up at him. Yoongi dutifully pauses, even though his legs are itching to carry him out of this godforsaken shop of happiness and sugar-induced heart attacks. Seeing that Yoongi is listening, Jimin draws a breath, before asking, \u201cDo you like Jungkookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Standing next to the table in the middle of the shop, Yoongi wonders if Jungkook also goes here a lot. If he\u2019s sat at this very table, in the chair next to Yoongi\u2019s. If Yoongi concentrates, he can almost see him, eyes closed up in laughter, smiling brilliantly. Maybe Jungkook has at some point stood at this very spot where Yoongi is standing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi admits, plainly. In the end, it\u2019s easier than he thought. As if it\u2019s been inside him all this time, tucked away underneath his tongue like a secret truth waiting to unfold. \u201cYeah, I like Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, are you gonna tell him that?\u201d Taehyung follows up, equally serious as he gazes up at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung and Jimin exchange looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re doing this for the sake of Kookie\u2019s happiness,\u201d Taehyung narrows his eyes at Yoongi. \u201cIf you make him cry again, I really will punch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dThat\u2019s fine by me, kid,\u201d Yoongi agrees. Digging around in his pocket for his wallet, he produces a shiny credit card. \u201cI\u2019ll pay on the way out, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s jaw drops for a split second before the scowl is back, more indignant than ever. \u201cAre you trying to <em>buy our cooperation?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite himself, Yoongi snorts, shattering the somewhat tense atmosphere. \u201cWho do you think I am, a chaebol? This isn\u2019t a drama, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019re kinda like the male lead in one,\u201d Taehyung muses, tilting his head supported by an elbow on the tabletop as he considers Yoongi. \u201cEmotionally stunted, rich, and kind of an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, burn,\u201d Jimin snickers, eyes scrunching up. Taehyung grins back at him, offering up his palm in a high-five gesture. Yoongi can\u2019t help but roll his eyes. These are the same kids that threatened him with physical violence only a minute ago. Jungkook\u2019s friends are something else, although, considering the people Yoongi himself likes to surround himself with, it\u2019s not like he has room to talk.</p>\n<p>People who, apparently, can\u2019t even pick up their phones to let him know they\u2019ve been hanging out with Yoongi\u2019s soulmate all this time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door hasn\u2019t even swung fully shut behind Yoongi before he\u2019s dialing Hoseok\u2019s number. Suspiciously, Hoseok picks up after only two signals, but Yoongi couldn\u2019t care less about that right now. The sheer urgency that fills him up makes his bones feel like they\u2019re vibrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung!\u201d Hoseok sounds nervous and a bit guilty underneath the cheerful tone of his voice. \u201cHaha, wow, is this a coincidence or what! I was just about to call you, you see, I have something\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Yoongi talks over him. \u201cHow is he? Is he okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014to tell you about... Wait, what? How did you know about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you <em>just answer</em>,\u201d Yoongi finds himself begging. His breath is quickening, and Yoongi realizes that he\u2019s been striding down the street unheeding of the other pedestrians, as if the answer would come faster if he just quickens his pace. He abruptly stops his feet from moving forward, coming to a halt so suddenly that he sways in place. Slumping against a store window, Yoongi bows his head as his free hand comes up to pinch the bridge of his nose. \u201cJust <em>tell me</em> how he is,\u201d he breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, are you okay? You sound a bit\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Is that important right now?!</em>\u201d Frustration makes his voice explode in volume, startling a couple who is just walking past. They look at him askance, but Yoongi just manages a apologetic jerk of his head. Forcibly trying to calm down, he grits into the receiver, \u201cI swear to God, if you don\u2019t tell me <em>right now</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine!\u201d Hoseok yelps. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, he\u2019s okay\u2014he\u2019s been with me all this time, don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi closes his eyes against the sudden wave of relief threatening to pull him under. He leans even more heavily on the window, feeling weak in the knees. Hoseok\u2019s voice calling to him sounds far away.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yoongi-hyung? Hyung? Are you still there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi clears his throat. \u201cSee, was that so hard? Why couldn\u2019t you just tell me that from the start,\u201d he says gruffly, scratching at the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been some time since I\u2019ve heard you lose your temper that badly, hyung,\u201d Hoseok muses. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been really worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, but then in the next breath he can\u2019t help but wanting to make sure, \u201cHe\u2019s really okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hoseok reassures him patiently. \u201cOr, I mean. As okay as someone who thinks their soulmate doesn\u2019t reciprocate their feelings at all can be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s stomach sinks. Every heartbeat seems to be a punch in his chest, a beat of <em>selfishselfishselfish. You caused this. Do something about it.</em> He clears his throat, tries to breathe through the pains.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour theory. What is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok is silent for a beat. \u201cHave you been talking to Jimin or Taehyung by any chance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPick one, get the other for free,\u201d Yoongi drawls tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, sounds like a party. Are you having a bad day, Yoongi hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoseok-ah,\u201d he says instead. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always kinda wanted to play matchmaker,\u201d Hoseok muses. \u201cLucky for you, I have been preparing for this moment\u2026 Aren\u2019t you happy I\u2019m your best friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDebatable,\u201d Yoongi deadpans, sharing a look with his reflection in the store window.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo stingy,\u201d Hoseok tuts disapprovingly. \u201cBut since you\u2019re missing your better half, I\u2019ll forgive you this once, hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure are pushing it for someone who\u2019s been hanging out with that better half without telling your <em>best friend.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh, scary,\u201d Hoseok singsongs. Yoongi despairs. \u201cI\u2019m sending you a file right now, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi frowns in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright?\u201d Removing the phone from his ear, he looks at the attachment popping up. It\u2019s a powerpoint presentation named <em>whykookiecantfeelyoongisundyingloveanddevotion.ppt</em>. Even without opening it, Yoongi knows it\u2019s gonna be in comic sans with a billion bad animation transitions in rainbow colors, because Hoseok is the kind of person who never mentally graduated from preschool and still draws the sun with a smiley face.</p>\n<p>\u201c... I really regret meeting you sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s what you say, but your heart just grew three sizes, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I feel sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Hoseok coos. \u201cI gotta leave now, but read that okay? It will make sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi says. He clears his throat. \u201cThanks, Hoseok-ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a slight pause before Hoseok\u2019s warm voice returns. \u201cAnything for my best friend\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cYou know I appreciate it, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Yoongi hears the smile in his voice even through the static of their breathing. \u201cI\u2019m hanging up first, hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi hums in confirmation and Hoseok chirps a last goodbye before the line goes silent. Yoongi lowers the phone. His fingers have gone stiff and cold from holding it to his ear for so long. People bustle past the spot where Yoongi stands, a continuous flow that just keeps moving forward, on and on.</p>\n<p>The screen of his phone that went black, suddenly buzzes and lights up in his hand. Yoongi startles, before pressing the text from Hoseok.</p>\n<p>[from: the hobi yoongi loves \u270c ] this one\u2019s a bonus~\u00a0(\u2267\u03c9\u2266)\u00a0fighting yoongi-hyung!!!!!<br>\n<em>see attached file .jpg</em></p>\n<p>Yoongi frowns and presses his cold fingertip against the link containing the picture.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jungkook. He\u2019s asleep, curled up on what looks like a pile of jackets on the floor of Hoseok\u2019s studio. The lighting is bad and the picture grainy, but Jungkook\u2019s face is relaxed in sleep, lips parted. One of his hands is gripping the material of the sleeve just over his right wrist. Among the jackets he looks tiny and abandoned, and Yoongi\u2019s chest aches like something fierce even as a smile works itself across his face.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s him. That\u2019s Yoongi\u2019s soulmate.</p>\n<p>Next to him, the stream of strangers hurrying through their lives continues.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did <em>what</em>,\u201d Jungkook asks blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had ice cream with Suga!\u201d Jimin\u2019s voice repeats happily, while Jungkook just blinks owlishly. \u201cOr well, me and TaeTae had ice cream and he just kind of sat there. Oh, and he also paid for it. Nice of him, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he\u2026 Why did he do that?\u201d Jungkook hesitates, hand curling around the phone held to his ear. There are so many questions he wants to ask, but struggles to voice aloud. <em>Did he seem angry? Did he look tired? Did he mention me, even once?</em> \u201cHow\u2026 how was he?\u201d he settles on, lamely.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause on Jimin\u2019s end before his voice picks up again. \u201cYou know, if you answered when he calls he could tell you himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tenses. \u201cDid Yoongi-hyung say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin heaves a sigh. \u201cKookie, you know I\u2019m firmly on your side\u201d\u2014Jimin ignores Jungkook\u2019s mutter of <em>what side</em>\u2014\u201dbecause it is my duty as part of your protection squad\u201d\u2014once again ignoring Jungkook\u2019s inquiry of <em>what protection squad</em>\u2014\u201dand because he obviously hurt your feelings, but... do you think you\u2019ll be happy with this?\u201d It\u2019s silent except for the sound of their breathing through the line. \u201cDo you think you could walk away like this and never know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jungkook whispers at least, and it\u2019s like a physical pain, the way every cell in his body is screaming in denial. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Jungkookie,\u201d Jimin says, soothing. \u201cI think you should talk to him. I know you have this habit of obsessively over-analyzing everything, but isn\u2019t it easier to just ask Suga-hyung? It\u2019s the only way you can be sure, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, talk to him. I think he misses you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin huffs. \u201cWhy do I get the feeling you\u2019re just agreeing with everything I say to make me stop talking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Jungkook answers airily. \u201cBut hyung, didn\u2019t your class start ten minutes ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s scowl is practically audible. \u201cWhy are you trying to change the subject? Don\u2019t try to distract me, don\u2019t you think I\u2019d know if my class\u2014\u201d There\u2019s a sudden spike of interference that Jungkook interprets as Jimin falling out of his chair. \u201cOh <em>hell</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should run, hyung,\u201d Jungkook helpfully suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you not say anything!\u201d Jimin wails as Jungkook tries to muffle his snickers. \u201cYah, you\u2019re dead to me, Jeon Jungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Jiminnie-hyung,\u201d Jungkook coos, and promptly hits the end call button.</p>\n<p>He flops backwards down onto the floor, phone clasped loosely in his hand. The smile fades away. He rolls over onto his side, bringing his phone close. Brightly lit, the screen radiates <em>Yoongi &gt;&gt; 12 missed calls</em>. Jungkook\u2019s thumb hovers over the call button.</p>\n<p><em>Just ask</em>, Jimin said. But even if Jungkook asks, how can he actually trust what Yoongi answers?</p>\n<p><em>Do you think you\u2019ll be happy with this</em>, Jimin said. His phone makes a clattering sound as it slips out of his hand and Jungkook twists onto his back again, dunking the back of his head against the floorboards in frustration. Of course not. Of course he can\u2019t be happy like this.</p>\n<p><em>I think he misses you</em>, Jimin said. Jungkook balls up the sleeves of his hoodie in his fists, and tries to muffle his shout into them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Monday, Jungkook lingers after the end of the dance session. Jimin offered to stay behind with him when he noticed the younger dragging his feet, but Jungkook brushed him off. He knows Jimin has a paper due tomorrow that he has been procrastinating the entire week. Besides, it\u2019s not like Jungkook has any real reason to stay, with his dorm back. It\u2019s just the thought of sleeping there alone, that makes goosebumps rise on his skin and his stomach crawl with unease.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a keyboard in Hoseok\u2019s dance studio, pressed up against the wall and out of the way for the dancers. Jungkook sinks down in front of it, cross-legged on the floor. Hoseok is still there as well, fussing with the the stereo equipment in the corner. He casts a furtive glance at Jungkook, who pretends not to notice. Maybe if he refuses to acknowledge the elephant in the room, it will relocate to nearest zoo by itself. No such luck though, because the next moment Hoseok asks,</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, have you talked to Yoongi hyung yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook presses four keys at once. The jarring sound it produces echoes off the mirrors in the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s a no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno what to say,\u201d Jungkook mutters defensively, trying another key that vibrates with a low sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know, the truth maybe?\u201d Hoseok rolls his eyes before fluttering his lashes and adopting a shrill tone that really sounds nothing like Jungkook at all, \u201cYoongi-hyung, I really like you so much, please take pity on me and relieve all my friends from the suffering of having to watch my insecure bumbling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, I had no idea you felt that way about Yoongi-hyung,\u201d Jungkook snarks.</p>\n<p>Hoseok throws his hands up. \u201cWhy do I even bother,\u201d he mutters. \u201cNagging you is Jimin\u2019s job. Stay here and sulk then, and lock up after yourself when you\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t grace him with an answer, and he hears Hoseok sigh before closing the door. Jungkook slumps on the floor, cross-legged as he clinks away at the piano. He\u2019s managed to pick out the melody to that song Yoongi and Namjoon played for him when he visited their studio by the time the door opens again. Jungkook doesn\u2019t glance behind him, figuring it\u2019s Hoseok again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away hyung,\u201d he says, flapping a dismissive hand in a way that\u2019s practically asking to get hit, but he\u2019s just not in the mood today. \u201cI told you I would lock up. I know how a key works, I\u2019m not five, despite what you and Jimin might think.\u201d</p>\n<p>His rant is met with chuckling, and Jungkook whips around so fast his neck cricks because that\u2019s <em>not</em> what Hoseok sounds like.</p>\n<p>Yoongi is leaning against the doorframe. He\u2019s wearing a snapback that pushes his fringe out of his face, and a hoodie that practically swallows his slight frame. Every cell in Jungkook\u2019s body is straining to go over to him and bury his face in the soft skin where Yoongi neck meets his shoulder. He swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoseok called me,\u201d Yoongi says, stepping into the room, and Jungkook groans internally. \u201cWhining something about all this playing hard to get driving him mad and for me to relieve his burden. Know anything about that?\u201d Jungkook glares at a point on the floor located somewhere between where he sits and Yoongi stands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi says and when Jungkook chances a glance up, he looks as serious as he sounds, all signs of amusement bleeding out of his expression. \u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>Does he?</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what you want,\u201d he finds himself mumbling. \u201cI mean, I guess you could stay. Whatever.\u201d Yoongi snorts softly under his breath, but comes over and drops down on the floor next to Jungkook. The warmth radiating from his body makes Jungkook want to snuggle into his side. To distract himself, he turns his full attention to the keyboard in front of them, and feels Yoongi do the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you dance, sing, and play the piano. Is there anything you<em> can\u2019t</em> do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good,\u201d Jungkook protests quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out what this part\u2019s supposed to be\u2026\u201d He demonstrates, fingers climbing up on the keyboard, forming a melody that stumbles before it cuts off by a dissonant chord.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not like that,\u201d Yoongi says from beside him and then he\u2019s leaning over, covering Jungkook\u2019s fingers with his own, correcting their placement over the keys. \u201cLike this, see? Listen.\u201d He presses down, hands warm on top of Jungkook\u2019s. This time, he sound that emits from the keyboard is harmonic and clear.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is still. Yoongi\u2019s shoulder is brushing his own. He\u2019s close enough that his pine forest scent washes over Jungkook, and his limbs <em>ache</em> with want. They remain frozen in position like that, the chord fading away as their breathing becomes the only thing stirring the silent air of the studio. Then Yoongi sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he treads their fingers together so he can tug Jungkook around to face him. Jungkook lets him maneuver them into position, gaze locked on their intertwined hands. Yoongi\u2019s voice is uncharacteristically soft as he continues. \u201cHoseok told me about the bond thing. He thinks you couldn\u2019t feel it because you,\u201d he breaks off, glancing away for a second, before continuing, \u201cyou were convinced I hate you and kept shutting it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tenses. He glances up, and Yoongi catches his gaze and holds it. His eyes are dark like freshly brewed coffee. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he finds himself asking.</p>\n<p>Only because he\u2019s watching so closely, Jungkook catches the small twist of Yoongi\u2019s mouth, the way the skin tighten around his eyes. \u201cDamn,\u201d he sighs. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t lying. I thought I was being pretty obvious too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook makes a move to untangle his fingers, to stand up, but Yoongi squeezes his hand in his, \u201cNo, hold on, Jungkookie, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d He looks like he really wants to dislodge one of his hands to scrub over his face, but only keeps holding on to Jungkook like he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll leave if he lets go.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant,\u201d Yoongi says, exasperation twisting around his words, \u201cthat I thought it was totally obvious how much I\u2026\u201d He cuts himself off again, breaking eye contact, and Jungkook stares in equal measures of shock and fascination as splashes of pink bloom out over Yoongi\u2019s cheeks like watercolor on a sheet of paper.</p>\n<p>\u201dHow much you what?\u201d Jungkook doesn\u2019t want to imagine possible endings to that sentence, doesn\u2019t want to hope but Yoongi is here, and Jungkook\u2019s heart is in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I want to explain some things to you, okay? About why I was... like that,\u201d Yoongi grimaces. His hands are still gripping Jungkook\u2019s tightly, palms clammy, but Yoongi isn\u2019t looking at their hands at all. Jungkook gets the feeling Yoongi isn\u2019t even aware of it anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoseok\u2026 He mentioned this other fan, right?\u201d Yoongi continues without waiting for confirmation. \u201cBack when me and Namjoonie were just starting out, we didn\u2019t have a lot of fans. She came to every performance we did, always came up to us afterwards, said she liked my music. She kept coming around, and I kept talking to her.\u201d Yoongi smiles, but there\u2019s nothing happy about the wry way his lips twist. \u201dI\u2019d never met someone with that kind of energy before. She was so enthusiastic about everything we did, <em>I</em> did. I guess I was just flattered at first... starving for someone\u2019s approval, y\u2019know? Then somewhere along the way, without me noticing, everything became about wanting to keep her smiling like that\u2026 Guess you can already see how well that worked out, right?\u201d Yoongi finally lifts his gaze to look at Jungkook, and his lips are pressed into a thin line, color bleeding out, like a paper cut.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Jungkook tries to ask, calmly, normally, but the air is thick in his throat.</p>\n<p>Yoongi shrugs, but the motion is jerky and tense, instead of relaxed like it\u2019s meant to be. \u201cI guess she was disappointed by the real me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook says, and it\u2019s probably insensitive and too loud, too flat, but he\u2019s too baffled and his thoughts are like a constant buzz in his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shocked,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, but the tug at his lips transforms into something more genuine and soft when Jungkook promptly shuts his mouth with a click, his cheeks heating. \u201cYou\u2019re making me feel bad. It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jungkook really tries, but he just can\u2019t wrap his mind around it. Jungkook has seen Yoongi on stage, brighter under the stage lights, aura something fierce and pulsating, capable of both whipping the crowd into a frenzy, and calming it into a breathless hush with nothing but his voice. Jungkook has been there, in that crowd.</p>\n<p>But now, Jungkook has also seen Yoongi at home, bleary eyed and and scruffy at 6 in the morning, wearing sweatpants and a threadbare T-shirt with three holes in the back, scowling like he\u2019s prepared to fight the entire world for a cup of coffee. He\u2019s seen Yoongi\u2019s eyes glare death at Hoseok while his pink mouth is suppressing a smile, cheeks being stretched out into a funny expression by Hoseok\u2019s flink fingers. He\u2019s seen Yoongi close to tearing his hair out over nothing but a temporary dry-spell of inspiration, mouth twisted in self-criticism as he continues to try and fail, not giving up until he\u2019s satisfied. Jungkook has seen Yoongi look at him in a dark room, like nothing else mattered except that moment, like the next words out of Jungkook\u2019s mouth might change everything.</p>\n<p>\n<em>How could anyone be disappointed by that?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Jungkook blinks out of his reverie only to realize Yoongi is watching him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d His mouth is growing into a grin, and god, it\u2019s like opening the blinds and suddenly the sun is right there, shining directly at you. \u201c...You\u2019re thinking something incredibly corny right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Jungkook fumbles out, frantically blinking to clear away the afterimage of Yoongi\u2019s smile. He tries for a scowl instead, \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014That\u2019s not at all\u2014how would you even know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lie to me Jungkookie,\u201d and Jungkook has a sudden urge to wipe that smirk off Yoongi\u2019s face. Also, an urge to crawl underneath the floorboards and hide, possibly until the end of time. \u201cI can feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook scrunches up his brows in puzzlement. \u201cWhat do you mean, <em>you can feel it?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that part,\u201d Yoongi promises, and his steady gaze makes Jungkook repress a shiver. \u201cYou\u2019ll let hyung finish, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, sure?\u201d Jungkook isn\u2019t sure what to do with this version of Yoongi, that just keeps <em>watching</em> him, like there\u2019s nothing other than Jungkook worthy of his attention.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s lips quirk, a sliver of a smile at his hesitant answer, before he sighs. \u201dAnyway, I tried to put that entire mess behind me, and it worked, for a while. And then <em>you</em> showed up, being all\u2026\u201d He gestures vaguely, and Jungkook wishes more than anything he would translate those hand movements into words. \u201dKinda embarrassing to admit, but I guess I hadn\u2019t really gotten over it at all\u2026 the fact that my soulmate was someone who at first only reminded me of her? Really pissed me off,\u201d and there\u2019s a bitter undertone in Yoongi\u2019s voice that makes Jungkook pull his hands away and out of Yoongi\u2019s grasp, wringing them together in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles, shoulders hunching as he curves in on himself.</p>\n<p>\u201dWhat are you apologizing for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes dart up reflexively in surprise and he gets caught in Yoongi\u2019s stare. \u201dUh,\u201d he licks his lips nervously. \u201dI\u2014I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dThen you shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Yoongi says, and for the reprimanding words, his tone is soft. \u201dAlright? Don\u2019t be sorry for things that aren\u2019t your fault. Hell, <em>I\u2019m</em> the one who\u2019s trying to apologize here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jungkook asks, hands curling into fists resting on his thighs. \u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I was being a selfish asshole,\u201d Yoongi replies bluntly, and Jungkook can see the muscles in his jaw jump with tension. \u201cBecause I treated you badly. I was scared of getting hurt, so I just ended up hurting you instead, like a fucking\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off, abruptly, sucking in a breath through his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really, really sorry, Jungkook\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tremble in Yoongi\u2019s voice, and his hands are shaking in his lap. Jungkook has a second to marvel at how vulnerable Yoongi looks, before a rush of emotion suddenly <em>slams</em> into him. The world flickers and fades out like static. He\u2019s lost in what feels like an inferno of anger and guilt, and <em>oh god, it hurts</em>. Jungkook is drowning, he doesn\u2019t understand, <em>doesn't understand</em> but he suddenly wishes desperately for Yoongi, for his warm and steadying grip, for his calloused palms, <em>anything</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Then, all of it is suddenly ripped away. Jungkook surfaces with a jerk, and the world tilts sideways once before righting itself into perfect clarity. He blinks owlishly, disoriented, but there is a anchoring grip on his arms and Yoongi is in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d He curses under his breath, but it\u2019s the wild look in his eyes that punches all the remaining air out of Jungkook\u2019s lungs. \u201cShit, fuck\u2014Jungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what happened?\u201d Jungkook rasps, shaking in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus christ, you scared the shit out of me,\u201d Yoongi breathes, grip going slack with relief. \u201cYou just stopped breathing, and then your emotions went haywire\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jungkook interrupts, frowning. \u201cMy... emotions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Yoongi lifts a hand from his arm and taps his index and middle finger against Jungkook\u2019s breastbone. \u201cI told you I feel them. In here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Jungkook stutters, the shock making him stumble over his words. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my soulmate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook hopelessly tries to ignore the rush of warmth rushing through him at hearing Yoongi say those words. He clears his throat awkwardly, missing the fond quirk of Yoongi\u2019s mouth. \u201cUm, well, but I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t feel\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Yoongi fills in, somewhat drily. \u201cI think you, uh. Might have. Just now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares as Yoongi\u2019s hand comes up to rub at the junction between his neck and shoulder, gaze fixed at some point to the left of Jungkook\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll that\u2026 That was <em>you?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Dragging his gaze back to meet Jungkook\u2019s wide eyes, Yoongi grabs his hand and guides it to lie flat against his chest, like an echo of that time in the hallway. \u201cJungkook-ah,\u201d he says. \u201cListen closely, alright? I\u2019m not good with expressing how I feel,\u201d a wry smile flits across his face, \u201cbut I figure that even a guy like me can tell the truth.\u201d Yoongi takes a deep breath, and Jungkook can feel his heartbeat jump under his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you.\u201d He doesn\u2019t stutter or stumble over the words, pronouncing them clearly and without hesitation.</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares. Yoongi holds steady under Jungkook\u2019s scrutiny, despite the color in his cheeks deepening. Something deep inside of Jungkook that\u2019s been tightly wound all this time, suddenly unfolds, and Jungkook\u2019s eyes widen in awe.</p>\n<p>It starts off slow. Like a warm brook, Yoongi\u2019s emotions start to trickle into his chest cavity. Then steadily, it grows stronger and stronger, filling him up from the inside, until every sense in his body is full of Yoongi, Yoongi, <em>Yoongi</em>. And Jungkook already knows, he knows, but he can\u2019t help but wonder, breathless, \u201cReally? Are you really sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s lips tug up, like he knows exactly what Jungkook is experiencing, and he probably <em>does</em>. The thought alone has Jungkook reeling. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m really sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t even try to fight the slow smile dawning on his face. It\u2019s like a silent explosion of fireworks are lighting up his insides. Yoongi isn\u2019t looking away for a second, and his eyes give Jungkook confidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d he grins, and it feels too wide but he can\u2019t stop. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I heard you the first time. What did you say again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou punk,\u201d Yoongi says, mirroring his expression and it makes Jungkook feel lighter than ever. \u201cI\u2019m changing my mind. You\u2019re a terror, I don\u2019t like you at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar,\u201d Jungkook giggles, a chortling sound he normally hates, giddy from the connection telling him all of Yoongi\u2019s real feelings, like a steady current. \u201cYou\u2019re lying to me right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi says, rolling his eyes, and Jungkook almost can\u2019t breathe from the wave of fond relief washing over him. \u201cYeah I am, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Loosening his grip on Jungkook\u2019s hand, Yoongi instead takes hold of his wrist, the one displaying the question <em>what\u2019s your name</em> in deep black. His fingers carefully trace the words of Jungkook\u2019s tattoo, trailing goosebumps in their wake. Jungkook shivers, then says, \u201cIt\u2019s Jungkook. I really admire you, hyung. I think you\u2019re amazing. You\u2019re creative and your rap is so cool. I really,\u201d he hesitates for a second and then finishes softly, blush creeping up his neck, \u201clike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi snorts at the confession, giving the wrist resting in his hand a squeeze. \u201cWhat prompted this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles timidly, peering at him through his eyelashes. \u201cIt was what I was planning to say to you, when we first met. At that fansign, I mean, when you asked for my name. I practiced it beforehand,\u201d he admits, somewhat sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Yoongi considers, pursing his lips before smoothing them out in a smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll give it five points for effort. Not very creative, and the delivery was weak. You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty enough to make up for it,\u201d he finishes smugly, eyeing the blush that spreads out across Jungkook\u2019s cheekbones and all the way to the tips of his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yoongi-hyung!</em>\u201d Jungkook fumes, gaping, and shoves at his shoulder. Yoongi laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t think you\u2019re pretty, Jungkookie?\u201d He lowers his voice into something more sultry, letting only traces of amusement linger. \u201cWant me to convince you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Through hooded eyes he sees the blush on Jungkook\u2019s cheeks deepen, and his dark eyes widen, before they flutter shut as the distance between them diminishes. Their knees bump against each other. Yoongi leans in, carefully nuzzles his cheek against Jungkook\u2019s warm one, and the sigh Jungkook\u2019s lips part around is sweeter than Yoongi\u2019s stage name. Tracing the tip of his nose along Jungkook\u2019s cheekbone, he whispers, \u201cJungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d It\u2019s barely a breath. Hot air washes over Yoongi\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Even though his own eyes have lidded to slits, he can still make out the scrunch of Jungkook\u2019s nose as he emits an offended noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you seriously <em>asking</em> for my fucking <em>permission</em>\u2014\u201d He starts, but the rest of the sentence ends in a muffled squeak as Yoongi closes the distance and slots their lips together.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s startled puff of breath is wet and hot. Yoongi carefully nips at his bottom lip, hand coming up to angle Jungkook\u2019s jaw so he can lick into his mouth. Jungkook makes a needy sound in his throat and presses closer. Yoongi feels him grab onto the fabric of his hoodie, clenching the garment in his fist.</p>\n<p>Jungkook tastes like home, like breathing in fresh air after being shut inside a stuffy studio room for too long, like waking up from a lifetime of slumbering. Yoongi keeps the kiss languid, lazily stroking his tongue against Jungkook\u2019s before sucking. Jungkook jumps, a startled \u201cah!\u201d slipping out of his mouth. The sound reverberates through Yoongi\u2019s entire being, making the breath in his lungs shake. He swipes his tongue against the roof of Jungkook\u2019s mouth before retreating with one last lick against his lips, grinning when Jungkook instinctively tries to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmurs, catching Jungkook\u2019s face in both his hands. His fingers fit under Jungkook\u2019s jawline, thumbs carefully rubbing gentle circles on Jungkook\u2019s flushed cheeks. His eyes are still closed and his mouth open, lips cherry red and slick with spit. Heat pools in the pit of his stomach, because Jungkook looks like a fucking <em>vision</em>. \u201cHey, Jungkook. Open your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s lids flutter open, and he looks at Yoongi. His normally dark eyes are practically black, pupils blooming into black holes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me say yes,\u201d he rasps, and god, even his voice is wrecked. Yoongi\u2019s tongue darts out to wet his lips, and Jungkook\u2019s eyes trace the motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were taking too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat impatient?\u201d Jungkook asks, teasing. Yoongi laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting mouthy with me, kid?\u201d he warns, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one that just got <em>mouthy</em> with me?\u201d Jungkook says innocently. \u201cIt was twenty seconds ago at most, can\u2019t you remember?\u201d He smiles cheekily. Yoongi wants to bite his jaw. \u201cYou must really be getting old, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little brat,\u201d Yoongi growls, pinching the round cheeks under his hands. Jungkook looks like he has more snippy comebacks to quip.</p>\n<p>Yoongi shuts him up by kissing him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, Yoongi doesn\u2019t realize what the white flakes floating down through the air are. He\u2019s just shutting the studio door behind them when Jungkook exclaims,</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d Yoongi turns towards him. Jungkook is standing a few paces away palms turned up towards the overcast sky. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks up. The bright glare of the streetlights obscure his vision, making him squint to make out the darkness beyond. A snowflake lands on his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d he replies, raising a brow. Jungkook laughs in a cloud of white mist, loud and bright.</p>\n<p>They start walking. Jungkook is staying a few steps ahead, Yoongi trailing behind, watching as Jungkook flits back and forth, touching the thin layer of snow on a wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cYah, Jeon Jungkook,\u201d Yoongi calls out to him, smile tugging at his lips. \u201cCome over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obediently, Jungkook comes ambling over, peering at Yoongi expectantly. Yoongi holds out his hands in the space between them. Jungkook looks at down at them, a tiny confused wrinkle appearing between his brows. It is, without doubt, the cutest thing Yoongi has seen in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hands are cold,\u201d Yoongi deadpans.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi wiggles his fingers. \u201cSo warm them up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares at him for a moment, open-mouthed like he can\u2019t believe what Yoongi just said.</p>\n<p>\u201c... Seriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi scowls, feeling the tips of his ears heat. \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to?\u201d He\u2019s about to stuff them back into his pockets when Jungkook grabs onto his withdrawing fingers. Yoongi stills, mid-motion.</p>\n<p>Jungkook clasps both of Yoongi\u2019s hands, cradling them between his own. His own fingertips are chilly, but his palms are hot. Yoongi swallows, eyes flicking up to meet Jungkook\u2019s. Slowly, like he expects Yoongi to pull away and wants to give him the opening, Jungkook lifts their hands towards his face, his dark eyes holding Yoongi\u2019s all the while.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s cheeks are flushed red. Yoongi wonders if they would be hot or chilly underneath his palm. They puff up slightly before Yoongi feels his breath catch in his throat, hopelessly, helplessly, as Jungkook\u2019s red lips form a perfect \u2018o\u2019, blowing hot breath onto Yoongi\u2019s hands, cupped in his own. Yoongi stands there staring, frozen stiff, as Jungkook\u2019s fingers carefully rub against his own. Jungkook\u2019s eyes are downcast, watching their hands. There are flakes of snow stuck in his eyelashes. Illuminated by the street light up ahead, his skin glows. He\u2019s heart-stoppingly beautiful, and Yoongi\u2019s heart <em>aches.</em></p>\n<p>Then Jungkook\u2019s soft lips graze Yoongi\u2019s fingers, and the unexpected touch makes his hand jerk in Jungkook\u2019s grip. Jungkook startles, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s snapping out of a trance, the magic spell broken. His eyes fly up to meet Yoongi\u2019s like he\u2019s expecting something, but Yoongi couldn\u2019t form words right now even if he wanted. Abruptly, Jungkook lets go of his hands. Shoulders hunching, he steps back slightly. The snow continues to fall, undisturbed.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, we should\u2026 Hyung, we should keep walking,\u201d he mumbles, face turned away. He makes to take another step away, but Yoongi\u2019s hand shoots up, grabbing onto his jacket before he can move any further. He steps up, raising his other hand to the side of Jungkook\u2019s face. Carefully, he slides it into Jungkook\u2019s hair, dark strands of hair slipping between his fingers. He hears Jungkook\u2019s shuddering intake of breath, and shifts his gaze from the contrast of the dark tufts of hair against his pale hand to Jungkook\u2019s expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have snow in your hair,\u201d Yoongi murmurs, voice pitched low like he\u2019s telling Jungkook a secret. \u201cYou should wear a hat, or you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s lips part, like he\u2019s whispering something under his breath, too quiet for Yoongi to hear. Then the edges of his lips curl ever so slightly upward.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, hyung,\u201d he says, eyes soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018okay hyung\u2019 me,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, withdrawing his hand again. His grip on Jungkook\u2019s sleeve loosens, palm sliding down his arm until his hand finds Jungkook\u2019s, fingers clasping. \u201cI\u2019m trying to show concern for your well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>They start walking again. Jungkook\u2019s fingers are curling tighter against Yoongi\u2019s. Yoongi squeezes back. The reward of warmth flooding into his heart makes him feel lighter than the snow floating through the air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So</em>...\u201d The host drags the words out, folding her hands atop her crossed legs as she leans back in the chair. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we finally address the question that has been on the tip of everyone\u2019s tongue\u2026\u201d She pauses dramatically, drawing out the silence as the audience starts murmuring excitedly. Yoongi barely resists the urge to roll his eyes. Seokjin already nags him about there being a limit to how blas\u00e9 of an image even a rapper like him can have.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe vocalist featuring on your new single that has been tearing up the charts this past week\u2026 A voice that\u2019s making hearts everywhere flutter,\u201d Yoongi bites the inside of his cheek hard so he won\u2019t burst out laughing in the middle of the broadcast, \u201dexcept, no one seems to be able to find out who it belongs to. Where did you even find this guy?\u201d She looks at them, expectant. Namjoon glances at Yoongi, who shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, he\u2019s one of our fans,\u201d Namjoon admits. The audience gasps collectively.</p>\n<p>\u201cA fan?\u201d The interviewer sounds intrigued. \u201cHow did you discover him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe came to one of our fansigns,\u201d Yoongi says, at the same time Namjoon flinks in with \u201cThat was all thanks to Suga-hyung, actually.\u201d Yoongi doesn\u2019t need to turn his head to know he\u2019s smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks to Suga?\u201d The bright stage lights shine on the perfect curls of the interviewers hair as she leans forward, smelling a juicy scoop. Yoongi would kick Namjoon, except there\u2019s no table to obstruct the view. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought it was the opposite. It is surprising that Suga, who is somewhat notorious for keeping a certain distance to your fans, would form enough of a connection with one to let them feature on your album... Did you say you first met at a fansign?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we did,\u201d Yoongi confirms, resigned. The fans and papers alike are going to be eating this up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <em>very</em> interesting,\u201d the interviewer says, sharing a significant look with the camera. \u201cHe must\u2019ve made quite an impression on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi also glances over, thinking of Jungkook watching this live on their sofa at home. He\u2019s probably freaking out over the fact that he\u2019s being discussed live on national television. Yoongi\u2019s hand instinctively drifts up to rest on top of his sleeve-covered wrist, as he feels the smirk on his lips melt into a soft smile. Inside his ribcage, his heart thumps and thumps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he tells the camera. \u201cYeah, I guess he did.\u201d</p>"
