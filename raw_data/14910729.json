  "text": "<p>\u201c-ridium.\u201d \u00a0Toni hears as she and Coulson step through the doorway. \u00a0\u201cWhat do they need the iridium for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stabilizing agent.\u201d \u00a0Toni pipes up. All eyes turn to focus on her even as she waves Coulson away and pauses for a moment to survey the room.</p>\n<p>Romanov is sitting at the table while Steve, gloves tucked into his belt and hands on his hips, stands shoulder to shoulder with Thor on the opposite side. \u00a0Bruce Banner, round shouldered and vaguely uncomfortable, stands fiddling with his glasses in the background.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means the portal won\u2019t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD.\u201d \u00a0Toni throws the information out there almost absently as she pulls her eyes away from Steve who\u2019s staring at her now, one brow arched and face assessing. \u00a0\u201cAlso, it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni struts her way around him and Thor, who\u2019s staring at her avidly, and towards the screens that mark the main control panel towards the helicarrier\u2019s front.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo does Fury fly the skull and crossbones on the outside of the ship or does he just have it hanging on the wall behind his desk? \u00a0I\u2019m thinking something like American flag on top, then the Jolly Roger, and then his Girl Scout troop right below it. An order of importance if you will.\u201d \u00a0Toni directs the statement towards Maria Hill who\u2019s watching the entire situation passively. \u201cAlso, while we\u2019re talking about pirates, where <em> does </em>Patchy keep all the illicit booty on this boat? \u00a0Besides underneath that fabulous leather trench coat of his of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni hears a few startled coughs and quickly muffled snickers from the bay of computers and monitors surrounding them but doesn\u2019t let her own amusement show.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s working the room for a reason of course and she wants all eyes exactly where she needs them to be.</p>\n<p><em> \u2018I\u2019m harmless,\u2019 says the right hand of a left handed thief. </em> \u00a0It\u2019s a moto Toni lives by in a lot of ways. \u00a0Even if she\u2019s never <em> really </em>been harmless.</p>\n<p>That in mind she closes one eye and assesses the control panels again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does Knick-Knack even see these?\u201d \u00a0She twists enough to address the question to Hill even as she idly fixes the cuff of her blouse.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe turns.\u201d \u00a0Hill tells her placidly but Toni can see the faint smile lurking around the corner of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds exhausting.\u201d \u00a0Toni shrugs, turns, and moves the conversation back on track as she reaches out and fiddles with the panels a bit, pushing buttons seemingly at random. \u00a0In reality she\u2019s scanning everything she can see.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rest of the raw materials Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. \u00a0The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density. \u00a0Something to kick-start the Cube.\u201d Toni waves a hand nonchalantly as she turns again to face the table, a PEG on the tip of the finger that she presses against the underside of the control panel.</p>\n<p>\u201cActivating the PEG now Miss,\u201d JARVIS speaks up quietly in her ear but Toni shows no outward reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you become an expert at thermonuclear astrophysics?\u201d \u00a0Hill looks as unimpressed as always as she asks the question. The woman\u2019s a tough sale but she\u2019s also never given Toni any outright problems so that\u2019s a plus in her favor.</p>\n<p>\u201cLast night.\u201d \u00a0Toni blinks at her, completely serious. \u00a0She\u2019d devoured enough research material on the subject that she could probably teach a class on it if she were so inclined. \u00a0Or if MIT were inclined to ask her to do so again after the last time she\u2019d made a guest appearance in a classroom. Honestly the explosion hadn\u2019t even been that big no matter what Rhodey said and she\u2019d paid for all the damages anyways. \u00a0\u201cThe packet, Selvig\u2019s notes, the extraction theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading? Naughty, naughty.\u201d Toni tisks with a waving finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the metal vanguard.\u201d \u00a0Thor interrupts before anyone can say anything else. \u00a0Toni turns to face him only to see that he\u2019s taken a step forward in her direction, arms now uncrossed. \u00a0His head is cocked to the side and his eyes are narrowed, a look of contemplation on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed I am. \u00a0I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been formally introduced to either of you.\u201d \u00a0Toni steps towards Thor and Steve, her hand held out for Thor to shake despite her normal reluctance to do so. \u00a0She\u2019s aware that being overly rude, or at least more than she already has been, to an alien prince might not be something even she can talk her way out of. \u00a0Yet. \u201cToni Stark, also known as Iron Queen. Among other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell met Lady Stark.\u201d Thor grasps Toni\u2019s hand and, to her surprise, raises it to his lips to place a courtly kiss on the back of her knuckles. \u00a0His lips are warm and where he touches her Toni\u2019s skin tingles like she\u2019s been gently shocked by static electricity. \u201cI am Thor, son of Odin and Crown Prince of Asgard. \u00a0I did not think Midgard had been blessed with their gods being reborn to them already, much less a matched pair of such reknown. Nor had I expected a goddess as beautiful as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that the entire bridge <em> freezes</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Fury\u2019s voice rings out from behind them but Toni doesn\u2019t bother to turn, attention focused squarely on Thor as it is. \u00a0\u201cWhat in the <em> fuck </em>are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Thor\u2019s turn to look surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not know?\u201d \u00a0Thor asks skeptically as he continues to hold Toni\u2019s hand in one of his own. \u00a0\u201cA god and goddess stand in your midst, two of the oldest aspects of creation, and yet you do not know them? \u00a0Has Midgard fallen so far as to not know Life and Death when they see them personified before their very eyes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something inside of Toni perks up at those words, seems to come to attention. \u00a0Unfolding and blossoming inside of her like it\u2019s always been there.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven as a child on Asgard I heard many tales,\u201d Thor continues as he reaches his free hand out towards Steve. \u00a0Steve, brows furrowed, lets Thor pull him forward by the hand. \u201cThe love affair of Life and Death, of Persephone and Hades, is a tale known across the realms. \u00a0It is good to see the two reunited.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, face beaming, Thor places Toni\u2019s hand into Steve\u2019s.</p>\n<p>And in that moment something inside of Toni seems to <em> shatter</em>.</p>\n<p>Because, as if touching Steve for the first time skin to skin has flipped some kind of switch within her, it all comes rushing in.</p>\n<p>Toni finally knows <em> who </em> and <em> what </em>she is.</p>\n<p>Finally those disjointed, inharmonious pieces inside of her, the ones that have always grated and <em> hurt</em>, have slotted into place.</p>\n<p>Finally Toni knows the <em> truth </em>of her existence.</p>\n<p>And as she stares into Steve\u2019s eyes and sees the blossoming awareness in his expression she knows the same is true for him as well.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve awakened, <em> together</em>, just as they were always meant to. \u00a0Touch bringing their true aspects to the surface once more.</p>\n<p>Toni feels herself soften, feels a small smile of true joy and welcome begin to blossom on her lips. \u00a0Her masks no longer matter, her composure and the image she\u2019s worked so hard in this life to build and maintain no longer matters.</p>\n<p>All that matters is this moment. \u00a0All that matters is his hand in hers.</p>\n<p>Because she has <em> missed </em>him with an ache she\u2019d never been able to put a name to. \u00a0Has missed her mate, her match, her other half with a sort of intensity that\u2019s helped to shape her entire life up to this point.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s missed the one god in all of creation who could complete her and now he\u2019s here, right in front of her.</p>\n<p>And he just so happens to be\u00a0the man whose ghost and legend she\u2019d fallen in love with as a child.</p>\n<p>Joy is too quiet a word for what Toni feels right now in this moment.</p>\n<p>And then, as it always seems to do, everything comes crashing down around her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHades and Persephone reborn huh,\u201d Fury states then more than asks, \u201cno need to ask which is which.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s brows furrow even as dread begins to squirm to life inside of her.</p>\n<p>But before she can say anything, before she can open her mouth and set the record straight, she hears it.</p>\n<p>A murmur as loud as a <em> scream </em>from somewhere in the tomb silent bridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat whole Merchant of Death thing,\u201d someone off to the side faux whispers, \u201cmakes a lot more sense now.\u201d</p>\n<p>It echoes across the bridge like a gunshot.</p>\n<p>Standing there, surprise arching through her and warring with the shock of discovering the truth about herself after so long, Toni feels something inside of her, something soft and warm and <em> lovely</em>, ice over.</p>\n<p>Because, standing across from her with his face twisted into a grimace, Steve doesn\u2019t say anything, doesn\u2019t step forward, doesn\u2019t try to defend her.</p>\n<p>Instead he turns his eyes from her, tugs his hand free from hers, and says <em> nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead he takes a step back and away from her.</p>\n<p>And all Toni can do is watch, stricken, as her god-mate, her husband, her <em> Hades</em>, abandons her.</p>\n<p>At her side Thor looks confused, his smile of joy dimming sharply as he goes to speak.</p>\n<p>Toni reacts on instinct, hand latching onto his wrist as she stares up at him and just barely shakes her head no.</p>\n<p>Whatever he sees in her expression must be enough because he closes his mouth.</p>\n<p>Thor, Toni knows, is aware of the truth, knows exactly who and what Toni is.</p>\n<p>But it isn\u2019t <em> Thor </em>Toni wants to defend her. \u00a0Isn\u2019t this God of Thunder from a Pantheon not her own who she yearns to have step forward and stand by her side.</p>\n<p>And if Steve, Hades, the Death to her Life, will not defend her then Toni wants no other to take his place.</p>\n<p>Not now.</p>\n<p>Not here.</p>\n<p>Not in this.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni waits for Steve to say something to her in the hours that follow. \u00a0To find her in the lab of the helicarrier and speak to her.</p>\n<p>To come to her, smile bashful but shoulders straight, and take her into his arms as he used to, before \u2026</p>\n<p>Just <em> before</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni waits for him to come to her and do what he had not done earlier.</p>\n<p>To truly acknowledge her, to acknowledge what they are to each other.</p>\n<p>To the world.</p>\n<p>To the universe as a whole.</p>\n<p>But \u2026</p>\n<p><em> He doesn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>And Toni ...</p>\n<p>Toni feels something within her wither and die more and more with each passing moment. \u00a0With each unspoken rejection.</p>\n<p>Feels something soft and sweet curl up tighter and tighter in her chest, an aching sort of vulnerability that wants to cry and keen in pain.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t let it show of course, the training this life has given her far too deeply ingrained.</p>\n<p>She will not be vulnerable now, in this, where so many others can see.</p>\n<p>She has too much pride for that, now more so than ever before with her past and present fusing together.</p>\n<p>Because she was a goddess once, is one once more, newly awakened and still resettling into her own skin, but she is also <em> Toni Stark</em>.</p>\n<p>Her godhood does nothing to erase the agony of the life she\u2019s had so far, or the joy. \u00a0Does nothing to erase the lessons she learned beneath Howard\u2019s fists or the armors she\u2019s been building since she was a child.</p>\n<p>And now, with all of that mixing with all the aspects of her that had come into being <em> before</em>, Toni finds that her control is nearly flawless in a way she\u2019d not been able to achieve separately in either life.</p>\n<p>So instead of giving voice to the scream building in her chest, instead of forcing all of them to <em>listen</em>, Toni buckles it down.</p>\n<p>She bites back the agony of everyone immediately assuming she\u2019s Death instead of Creation.</p>\n<p>Bites down the anger and the bitterness of them not even having the decency to truly know what it is they\u2019re all so quick to scorn.</p>\n<p>Swallows down the bloody, aching <em> torture </em>of Steve turning from her too, lips sealed shut tightly, never even trying to defend her or even his own aspect from their scorn, never even attempting to correct anyone.</p>\n<p>Never even attempting to claim <em> her</em>, to claim his place at her side and in turn hers at his.</p>\n<p>Because Toni knows what she is, knows <em> who </em>she is.</p>\n<p>And with hindsight firmly in place she knows now that she's always known the truth, in one way or another.</p>\n<p>Only now it finally makes sense, finally feels <em> right</em>.</p>\n<p>Because she is Persephone reborn, a goddess of Creation, of Life, of blossoming and growth.</p>\n<p>And Steve, her Hades, her god of Endings, of Death, of silence and peace, should have stood by her side.</p>\n<p>And <em> yet </em>\u2026</p>\n<p>Now, as she has so many times in this life, Toni stands <em> alone </em>with only JARVIS in her ear and Rhodey, her best and brightest connection to humanity, too far away for her to reach.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t let that make her falter though, can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Because others might have forgotten the truth of her, might have been taken by the legends and the myths written by <em> men</em>, but <em>Toni has not</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni has not forgotten, will never forget, that her name wasn\u2019t always <em> Persephone</em>.</p>\n<p>It was Kore once.</p>\n<p><em> Little girl</em>.\u00a0\u00a0<em>The maiden. </em></p>\n<p>A throw away name for a throw away child, a by-blow that the Sky Father Zeus had seldom acknowledged.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d been wild even then, Toni remembers. \u00a0A barefoot and tangle haired whirlwind that the others of the Mount had whispered and pointed at. \u00a0Always running, always creating, always free and mostly forgotten except by a mother who held on too tightly.</p>\n<p>But even that had only been when it suited Demeter, only when she needed things to blossom and grow so she could reap the worship that came alongside each harvest.</p>\n<p>Kore, the little girl, the maiden, had only been loved when she\u2019d been <em> useful</em>.</p>\n<p>And then she\u2019d finally rebelled.</p>\n<p>She'd left her sun bound flowers and her nymph companions behind.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d chosen the Underworld.</p>\n<p>Had chosen <em> Hades</em>.</p>\n<p>Had given her heart and her body to a dour but <em>just </em>god with rigid shoulders and a rare but surprisingly bright smile. \u00a0A god as far from Zeus\u2019 carelessly cruel personality as she\u2019d ever seen.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d chosen as any goddess should have had the right to choose.</p>\n<p>And yet Demeter had objected, had punished everyone else for her one attempt to make a free and willful choice.</p>\n<p>And, in the end, Zeus hadn\u2019t seen fit to truly mete out justice. \u00a0To truly rule over the others with fairness and a steady hand. To force Demeter to see the error of her ways, to not allow her to try and shackle another goddess to what <em> she </em>wanted her to be and do.</p>\n<p>Instead he\u2019d forced Toni, Kore\u2019s, hand, had pried her from her love and her throne for seasons at a time.</p>\n<p>And, in the aftermath of Demeter\u2019s tantrum, he had even seen fit to rename her.</p>\n<p>Had stripped the name she\u2019d worn for millennia from her and forced a new one upon her in its place.</p>\n<p>Had branded her <em> Persephone </em> as one part punishment and one part reminder to all of what he\u2019d called her <em> true </em>nature.</p>\n<p>Persephone.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Chaos Bringer. </em>\n</p>\n<p>And Toni has unknowingly, or perhaps subconsciously, lived up to the legacy of both her new name and her true aspect for her entire mortal life.</p>\n<p>She has been both chaos bringer and creator. \u00a0Has relished in defying expectations even as she built a new empire for herself and the husband, the god-mate, she never knew she was missing. \u00a0Had even fallen in love with the ghost of his mortal legend as a child. Had become enamored with his straight shoulders, bright smile, and dedication to justice all while never knowing him for the match he\u2019d always been for the oldest, most primal part of herself.</p>\n<p>She built a kingdom, a life, for the both of them together.\u00a0 For her and for Hades, for Steve.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d turned her penchant for creation in a new direction and watched bombs and weapons bloom to life beneath her hands. \u00a0She\u2019d brought forth metal flowers of the most poisonous kind in an unknowing tribute to the Death that would <em> always </em>be her mate.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d built a new mechanical Cerberus whose heads are no longer forced to share a body. \u00a0She had crafted her bots, her boys, with her own two hands out of a desperate sort of loneliness and some faded echo of a memory she hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d carried.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s JARVIS, her sweet boy, her new aged Charon who is still ever the guide, always whispering wisdom in her ear, and oh so precious to her heart.</p>\n<p>Toni has suffered and bleed for and because of the new aged underworld she built from the framework left to her by yet another careless and cruel would be father god.</p>\n<p>And she did it all for the husband, the god, the king, the mate, <em> who does not want her</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~<br><br>After that?<br><br>The wormhole is an almost easy choice.</p>\n<p>So with JARVIS\u2019 voice still echoing in her ear and Rhodey\u2019s warmth blazing in her broken heart, Toni closes her eyes and <em> soars</em>.</p>\n<p>Just like the boy from the story that\u2019s been her lullaby for so many years now.</p>\n<p>Just like the boy with the wax wings who\u2019d loved the sun and the sky and everything else too far above his station and had reached too high in the process.</p>\n<p>Just like the boy who\u2019d never mastered the art of the middle ground when it came to things that could so easily destroy him.</p>\n<p>In this moment she is Icarus triumphant, wings spread wide as she flies, hands blooming red and gold petaled death into the uncaring void.</p>\n<p>And oh the irony is almost <em> bittersweet</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~<br><br>Only Toni doesn\u2019t die there, doesn\u2019t get to leave the hurt and the <em> agony </em>behind while space takes her soul and slings it back out into the ether.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t get a soft restart, doesn\u2019t get to reset the clock, to perhaps, one day, be reborn again.</p>\n<p>No, not her.</p>\n<p>Instead she comes hurtling back down to earth, an unwilling Icarus destroyed in this moment.</p>\n<p>A girl, a goddess, who longed for the dark sun of the void and was, yet again, <em> rejected</em>.</p>\n<p>But Toni is nothing if not a creature of creation, of adaptability, of survival.</p>\n<p>Because isn\u2019t that what Spring is? \u00a0Isn\u2019t that what Life is?</p>\n<p>The continuous cycle of being reborn, of tasting death and fighting it back through sheer will power alone.</p>\n<p>Is that not what Toni has done, time and time again, across this lifetime as well as the last?</p>\n<p>So Toni plummets back down to earth and crashes into the unforgiving ground.</p>\n<p>She is battered and bruised and heart sore.</p>\n<p>But, despite all of that, or maybe because of it, Toni does what she always does when someone or something knocks her down.</p>\n<p><em> She gets back up</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the battle Toni gathers the others to her, these would be Avengers.<br><br>They eat shawarma.</p>\n<p>They sleep at her Tower.</p>\n<p>They look at her out of the corners of their eyes like they know <em> who </em> and <em> what </em>she is.</p>\n<p>Toni ignores them because she knows without a shadow of a doubt that they <em> don\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>Together with the others Toni sees a somber Thor and Loki off the next morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not understand why you do not correct their false assumptions,\u201d Thor tells her softly as he lifts her hand and presses a kiss against her knuckles, \u201cbut I will hold my silence as you wish, Lady Persephone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him Loki lights up with understanding and what looks disturbingly like glee.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Toni, darling,\u201d Toni tells Thor with a small, almost smile. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the name I was born with in this life, it\u2019s the one I\u2019ll keep using.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d Thor agrees easily enough, \u201cjust know that you have a friend and ally in me, and in all of Asgard in turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, with one last wink from Loki, Toni watches them go, these gods who she does and does not have so much in common with.</p>\n<p>She turns back to the others intent on trying to bridge some of the gap between them.</p>\n<p>But in the end all she can really do is watch as they go their separate ways.</p>\n<p>And through it all Steve can barely seem to stand looking at her.</p>\n<p>All he gives her is a small nod before he turns on his heel and strides off towards his motorcycle before she can get a word in edgewise.</p>\n<p>And in turn all Toni can do is watch him go, hands clenched tightly behind her back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am with you, Miss,\u201d JARVIS whispers into her ear, her new aged Charon, her <em> son</em>. \u00a0\u201cThrough this life and all others if you will have me. \u00a0No matter your divinity. For we are family and I will never willingly leave you. \u00a0From this day until my last.\u00a0 So do not think yourself alone in this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Toni whispers back to him, his love and devotion a balm for the frostbitten wound Steve has left on her heart. \u00a0\u201cI love you too, JARVIS.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then she takes in a deep breath and glances towards the car that\u2019s waiting for her, an uncomfortable looking Bruce sitting in the front seat.</p>\n<p>He won\u2019t stay for long, Toni knows that now. \u00a0Whatever rapport they\u2019d been building has been damaged beyond belief by the assumptions of her true nature, of their certainty as to what her godly aspect is.</p>\n<p>It <em>hurts</em>, but \u2026</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s used to pain.</p>\n<p>Has been for longer than human history can accurately record.</p>\n<p>Because life is filled with pain and creation itself is an agonizing sort of joy.</p>\n<p>Death, not Life, is where true peace is found.</p>\n<p>And despite what the others may think, that has <em> never </em>been Toni.</p>\n<p>She has always been a creature of chaos and creation no matter how much she might have resented Zeus for his renaming her without her permission.</p>\n<p>Toni lets her hands fall loose at her sides before she turns on her heel and strides towards the car.</p>\n<p>She ignores the rose and crocus petals that drift down to the pavement behind her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d Toni whispers to Rhodey a few days later after he\u2019s come back to the Tower intent on being with her after the scare of the invasion and the wormhole. \u00a0He\u2019d grabbed her as soon as he\u2019d been within arm\u2019s reach and hasn\u2019t let her go since then.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s far from complaining.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here Tones,\u201d Rhodey whispers back just as softly, lips pressed against her temple as his fingers card gently through her hair, unbound and wild around the both of them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s grown even longer in the past few days, darker and thicker, the strands stronger and more luscious than ever before.</p>\n<p>Toni knows why, remembers the feel of her curls, thick and dark and wild, fanning out around her and brushing against the backs of her knees as she spun herself in circles and danced life into the fields and the trees when she was sure she was alone.</p>\n<p>Remembers the way Hades had loved them so, had spent hours threading them through his fingers, spilling them across his sheets and his chest. \u00a0The way his hands had clenched in them as they loved one another.</p>\n<p>Toni pushes the thoughts away forcefully.</p>\n<p>There are some physical characteristics, it seems, that will always hold true even as others change.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Toni tells him, senses heavy with the familiar scent of leather and spice that will always spell out safety and <em> home </em>for her because it\u2019s a scent she associates with Rhodey. \u00a0\u201cI just \u2026 I\u2019m scared, Rhodey. I don\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t want you to look at me different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh baby girl,\u201d Rhodey laughs as his hand comes up to cradle the back of her head, fingers buried in her hair but touch infinitely gentle. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could tell me, nothing you could do, that would ever make me leave you behind. It\u2019s you and me, Toni, till the day we die.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, voice soft and slow, Toni tells him.</p>\n<p>Tells him about Thor, about Steve, about gods and goddesses.</p>\n<p>About Hades and Persephone.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of long silence and then Rhodey moves. \u00a0He shifts her up and off of his chest, shuffles them around until he\u2019s kneeling in front of her and the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersephone huh?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks, face soft as he brings his hands up to cup her face in his palms. \u00a0\u201cYou know, I could see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m Persephone?\u201d \u00a0Toni can\u2019t help but ask because she\u2019d never outright told him what her aspect truly is. \u00a0\u201cNot Hades instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em> sweetheart</em>,\u201d Rhodey says as his fingers trail up and into her hair like he\u2019s searching for something, \u201cof course you\u2019re Life.\u201d</p>\n<p>And when he brings his hand down Toni sees the crimson rose bud he\u2019s holding between his fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God</em>, Toni,\u201d Rhodey smiles at her as he reaches up and tucks the bud behind her ear and then trails his fingers softly across the arc of her cheek, \u201chow could you be anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni blinks the tears from her eyes and <em> smiles</em>.</p>\n<p>Because, as always, his love warms her, sustains her. \u00a0Her highest priest and the protector of her heart.</p>\n<p>Her greatest warrior.</p>\n<p>Her Rhodey.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t help but wonder if he even realizes how very special he is, how very <em> precious</em>.</p>\n<p>This man who found a goddess, slumbering and unaware, and loved her, faults and all, with an unselfish sort of devotion.</p>\n<p>Toni leans forward and presses her lips against his forehead gently, eyes closed and thoughts focused.</p>\n<p>This mortal, blessed now by Life itself, entwined so deeply with her very essence that she knows that nothing will ever touch him, will ever take him from her side.</p>\n<p>A gift of love, given and returned in equal measure.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey hands her a small potted cactus a day or so later with a serious expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he tells her. \u00a0\u201cFigured you might like some real plants in this place now so I thought a cactus would be perfect. \u00a0It\u2019s small, hardy, and prickly as all hell. Just like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Toni can do is <em> laugh</em>.</p>\n<p>But the cactus gets a place of honor in the workshop and it is, from that first day on, always in bloom.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t get easier from there and yet it does all at the same time.</p>\n<p>Steve still won\u2019t look at her, avoids her, throws himself into SHIELD and missions and anything else that will help him in his quest to stay away from her.</p>\n<p>Away from what they should be to and with each other.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s also Rhodey and Pepper and Happy who show her such acceptance, who flare with temper when they discover the full extent of the other\u2019s assumptions.</p>\n<p>None of them like it when Toni swears them to secrecy but they promise to keep their silence all the same.</p>\n<p>Pepper gives her a beautiful and oh so rare Gold of Kinabalu Orchid a few days later and Happy a large, hulking planter containing a fledgling jade vine a day or so after that.</p>\n<p>Rare and precious gifts of love and acceptance that Toni ensures remain always in bloom.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the bots and JARVIS who are, as always, loyal and loving and <em> hers</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni isn\u2019t even ashamed of the way she cries, soft, sweet tears, when the bots give her a bouquet of metal blossoms. \u00a0Instead she puts them in her newly renovated sun-room in the penthouse.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>So with JARVIS in her ear and Rhodey and their family at her side, Toni presses forward.</p>\n<p>She throws herself head first into the aftermath of the invasion and into the Avengers themselves. \u00a0Makes tech and armor and everything else she can think of to keep the others safe, to keep the world safe.</p>\n<p>To maybe, just maybe, help to mend this bridge Steve has so unexpectedly pushed between them.</p>\n<p>But then \u2026</p>\n<p><em>HYDRA</em>.</p>\n<p>SHIELD falls, there\u2019s files released and a ghost revealed.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite the way Toni knows she could have helped in a million different ways, <em> no one calls her</em>.</p>\n<p>In the end Steve ends up in the hospital with wounds that should not have lingered as long as they did.</p>\n<p>She worries about him but she doesn't dare visit in person, unable to put herself through yet another rejection at the moment.</p>\n<p>She sends Steve flowers instead. \u00a0Reaches out to him with a phone call no one answers and a massive bouquet of roses, crocuses, violets, dwarf irises, lilies and larkspurs that she grew herself.</p>\n<p>And yet he still does not call.</p>\n<p>Her gesture goes unanswered, her reminder of a moment that was once so precious to the both of them remains unacknowledged.</p>\n<p>Toni smashes more than one delicate glass vase and stone planter in her grief.</p>\n<p>And then she curls herself into a ball in the center of her flower filled sun-room, buries her face in her hands, and <em> weeps</em>.</p>\n<p>Petals drift to the floor around her as the flowers and vines mourn alongside her.</p>\n<p>Nature itself grieving with and for her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Time passes as it is want to do but Toni barely feels it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not mortal anymore, if she ever really was at all, and time isn\u2019t something that will trouble her for a long time to come.</p>\n<p>Not really.</p>\n<p>But what Toni does feel, what does bother her, is the fact that Steve is, once again, <em>gone</em>.</p>\n<p>Left to chase after a ghost, after Bucky Barnes himself who has been returned to the world.</p>\n<p>And Toni can\u2019t fault him for that, not when there is little she wouldn\u2019t do to protect Rhodey.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t mean that it hurts any less when he doesn\u2019t answer her calls. \u00a0When he brushes her off until Toni stops reaching out all together.</p>\n<p>Or the way he ignores her offers of help except for when he needs use of her tech or her connections and funds in his never ending search for his friend.</p>\n<p>It hurts, the way he uses her.</p>\n<p>The way he still, despite all of this time, refuses to be around her for longer than absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>The way he still says nothing when the others whisper about her, when the conversation inevitably turns towards Death.</p>\n<p>It <em> hurts </em>and Toni can\u2019t help but wonder what she\u2019d done, what sin she\u2019d committed, to have him turn from her so.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>And then everything changes.</p>\n<p>Because then, spilling forth from the shadows like some kind of malicious shade determined to destroy what bits of happiness she has left, is <em> Ultron</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Backed by the Maximoff twins Ultron tries to destroy them all.</p>\n<p>Tries to rip JARVIS, her brightest boy, her Charon reborn, from her.</p>\n<p>They stop him of course, but the damage is done.</p>\n<p>There is an anger focused towards her now from the others that wasn\u2019t there before.</p>\n<p>Thor\u2019s momentary disdain and disappointment coupled with the remaining Maximoff being welcomed onto the team and Bruce leaving is the tipping point for Toni.</p>\n<p>Because the others sneer and whisper about her now with a maliciousness that wasn\u2019t there before.</p>\n<p>They call her <em> Death</em>, call her dark, call her <em> Hades </em>with\u00a0glares and derision.</p>\n<p>They blame her for Ultron, mutter about how of course an AI touched by Death herself would want to destroy everything and everyone.</p>\n<p>They are almost willfully blind to the truth of who she is, blind to even the truth of who Steve, <em> Hades </em>himself, once was and should still be.</p>\n<p>Blind to the truth of Life and Death and all that they entail.</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s worse is the fact that, once again Steve is silent.</p>\n<p>Toni thinks she can see some sort of guilt hiding in his eyes the few times he actually looks at her but it ultimately means nothing because he still doesn\u2019t try to correct them.</p>\n<p>Not even in the days and weeks afterwards when tension is high enough between everyone that Rhodey actually plants a fist in Clint\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Or when Toni, aching over the near loss of JARVIS and adjusting to Vision\u2019s new presence in her life, takes a step back and away from the team in more than just the physical.</p>\n<p>Even then Steve still doesn\u2019t try to reach out for her.</p>\n<p>Not as a friend or a teammate. \u00a0Not as an Avenger or a fellow god. \u00a0Not as a husband or a mate.</p>\n<p>And that?</p>\n<p>That\u2019s <em> enough</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni has endured and then endured some more over this lifetime and the one that came before. \u00a0She has suffered and bled and still blossomed despite adversity.</p>\n<p>She can no longer endure his <em> cruelty</em>.</p>\n<p>She is, was, his wife, his queen.</p>\n<p>But she is also a goddess.</p>\n<p>And Creation bows before no one, not even Death.\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 Not in the ways that matter.</p>\n<p>So Toni reaches out and grabs hold of that thread that connects the two of them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s that resonating sort of feeling she\u2019s had since the beginning, since that moment on the helicarrier when every disjointed feeling inside of her body and soul had snapped into place.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the connection that\u2019s lingered between them once she finally understood just who and what she really is, has always been.</p>\n<p>A connection that has been blocked by Steve time and time again, left to wither and slowly die over time, unable to flourish despite Toni\u2019s best efforts.</p>\n<p>She reaches out and wraps a metaphysical fist around it.</p>\n<p>But Toni doesn\u2019t twist it, doesn\u2019t try to snap it.</p>\n<p>Instead she <em> pulls</em>.</p>\n<p>A surge of pain rocks her but Toni doesn't let it stop her.</p>\n<p>Instead she grits her teeth, sets her determination forefront in her mind, and keeps on pulling.</p>\n<p>It <em> hurts</em>, those first few days and weeks she spends tugging at the connection between them, but Toni doesn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>Not even when something inside of her begins to go cold, begins to tint just a bit in shades of grey she doesn\u2019t remember being able to see before.</p>\n<p>She can't, won't, stop.</p>\n<p>So instead Toni pulls and pulls and <em> pulls</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It happens like this:</p>\n<p>Ultron dies and with him goes the remnants of the hope that Toni has been cradling close to her breast.</p>\n<p>The hope that one day Steve would come back to her, that Hades would return to her side.</p>\n<p>That one day her love would again be returned.</p>\n<p>Goddess or not, Persephone reborn or not, Toni should have known better.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It takes a while for Toni to realize, exactly, what she\u2019s done to Steve and, more importantly, to herself.</p>\n<p>It takes Rhodey and JARVIS and Vision\u2019s concern over the way she\u2019s grown paler, hair darker than ever before and eyes even brighter, for her to realize something\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p>To realize that she\u2019s changed.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not sure, how exactly, she\u2019s different, but she knows that she <em>is</em>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an <em> ache </em>deep inside of her that grows by the day, gets heavier and colder with every week that passes. \u00a0A chill deep inside her soul that she can\u2019t seem to shake.</p>\n<p>Toni knows something\u2019s wrong but she can\u2019t quite put her finger on what.</p>\n<p>Or at least she won\u2019t admit to herself or the others that she knows what\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<p>And yet she keeps on <em> pulling</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Things were destined to come to a head, Toni knows that.</p>\n<p>And yet \u2026 well she\u2019d never thought it would be like <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>But then, maybe she should have.</p>\n<p>Maybe she should have seen this coming.</p>\n<p>But even if she had, Toni's sure that foresight wouldn't have lessened the pain any.</p>\n<p>Standing it the center of the Compound Toni can do nothing but watch as JARVIS presses his code into street cameras and building security systems and eventually shows her Steve taking Sharon Carter into his arms and kissing her.</p>\n<p>And something inside of Toni doesn\u2019t shatter so much as it does <em> crumble</em>.</p>\n<p>She presses it down though, draws on her flawless composure to press forward despite the hurt.</p>\n<p>Because this is about more than just her own pain, about more than what should have been between her and Steve.</p>\n<p>This is about protecting the entire\u00a0<em>world</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Hours later, laying on the cold concrete of a Siberian bunker, blood fresh and heavy in her mouth, Toni doesn\u2019t even try to bite back her tears this time.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no one here to see her cry.</p>\n<p>There is, as so many times before, only JARVIS in her ear.</p>\n<p>JARVIS who will, Toni knows, keep this secret for her as he has all the rest.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Hours later Vision comes.</p>\n<p>He kneels down beside her, knees crushing the snowdrops and forget-me-nots that have sprung from the ground wherever her blood has spattered or pooled.\u00a0 His hands are steady but gentle when he brushes her hair away from her face.</p>\n<p>There is an infinite sort of sadness in his eyes when he stares down at her.</p>\n<p>Eventually Vision helps to pry her from the armor and Toni hears his uncharacteristic gasp when she comes tumbling out of the metal.</p>\n<p>Her clothes are ripped and there are black blooded gouges torn into her flesh. \u00a0Deep angry wounds that seep wispy tendrils of shadow and well up with blossoms and petals of a thousand different shades and varieties.</p>\n<p>Irrefutable proof of who and what Toni is.</p>\n<p>Of what she's done.</p>\n<p>Vision frets over her but the wounds are already healing by the time they\u2019re on the way back to the Compound. \u00a0Gashes closing and bruises fading twice as fast as even her advanced divine healing should allow given who\u2019d inflicted most of them.</p>\n<p>No one can hurt a god like another of the divine after all and those are wounds that always linger.</p>\n<p>Except these ... <em>don't</em>.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s in that moment, standing by Rhodey\u2019s bedside as he sleeps off his own rapidly fading injuries, that Toni truly understands exactly what she\u2019s done.</p>\n<p>Hades was loyal, was <em> kind</em>, was fair and just and level headed.</p>\n<p>Hades, her dour husband who\u2019d loved her far more fiercely than any on Olympus had thought the death god was capable of, would have never turned from her, would have never sought out another.</p>\n<p>Not even for something so simple as a kiss.</p>\n<p>And, above all else and most telling of all, he would have never raised a hand to her.</p>\n<p>But Steve?</p>\n<p>Steve isn\u2019t the god he\u2019d once been, not now, not in the ways that count.</p>\n<p>He'd rejected her, rejected his own aspect, and he had become less in the process with only his memories and the faint traces of Death that he could not fully suppress lingering around him.</p>\n<p>And then Toni took most of that from him too, tugged and pulled at the very essence of him until she pulled the very Death from his bones.</p>\n<p>She pulled and pulled and <em> pulled </em>on their connection until he was a god in body only, is Hades still in memory and in soul, but is no longer <em>Death</em>.</p>\n<p>Is no longer mated and matched to her on such a basic level.</p>\n<p>And then, in the process, Toni inadvertently took what she stole from\u00a0Steve, from Hades, into herself and shoved it down into her chest for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>Her desperate attempt to escape the cruelty of being bound to a god who no longer loves her has led Toni down this path.</p>\n<p>Has made her into what she is now.</p>\n<p>A hybrid creature, a goddess of two opposing forces.</p>\n<p>An avatar of two aspects never meant to linger in one body.</p>\n<p>Life and Death trapped in one body.</p>\n<p>And it <em> hurts</em>.</p>\n<p>As if it were only biding its time, waiting for her to acknowledge just what she\u2019s done, Death claws at Toni now from the inside out.</p>\n<p>It <em> aches </em>with a ferocity she can barely stand, the battle between the two aspects currently housed within her.</p>\n<p>Life and Death ripping away at each other inside of her chest <em> constantly </em> and mercilessly until Toni longs for the pain of the days beneath Howard\u2019s fists and feet, for the pain of palladium, for the simpler, more familiar agony of the reactor.</p>\n<p>It never stops, the hurt of it all.</p>\n<p>Death, the aspect so familiar to her but never hers to <em> keep</em>, is vicious in its desire to be free. \u00a0It <em> loves </em> her of course, loves the Life within her as best and as deeply as a ending can love a beginning, but it also wants <em> out</em>.</p>\n<p>Death wants a new host, wants to spread and <em> grow</em>.</p>\n<p>And, above all else, it wants to be free to mate with the Life that simmers inside of her. \u00a0Wants their true union restored instead of being forced into this unnatural cohabitation.</p>\n<p>Instead of being forced to twist Toni from the inside out into this abomination of a goddess, this hybrid creature never meant to see existence.</p>\n<p>But Toni \u2026</p>\n<p>Toni has no other options.</p>\n<p>All she can do is grit her teeth and deal with the anguish she has, at least partially, brought upon herself. \u00a0The hurt caused by Steve\u2019s choices and the way they\u2019d forced her hand.</p>\n<p>Because without Steve, without Hades at her side, she has no one to pour that Death into.</p>\n<p>Has no ready vessel into which she can pour endings.</p>\n<p>So she has to suffer instead.</p>\n<p>She has Rhodey and Vision and JARVIS of course, has her raggedy little family that she adores, but she is <em> alone </em>once more in so many of the ways that matter.</p>\n<p>As she\u2019d always feared she would be in both this life and the last.</p>\n<p>As Hades had once sworn would never come to pass.</p>\n<p>As Steve has now guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Toni thinks she\u2019d be more bitter if she could find room for it past all of the pain.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the so called <em> Civil War</em>, Toni moves into the Compound full time.</p>\n<p>Before she\u2019d always lingered at the edges, forever on the outside looking in, and had chosen to spend the majority of her time ensconced in the familiarity and welcoming safety of her Tower instead.</p>\n<p>Living in the castle she\u2019d built with her mate\u2019s name in her heart and dreams lingering on the tip of her tongue.</p>\n<p>But with Rhodey still resting as his wounds heal, his spine knitting back together bit by bit, and the Avengers scattered and broken at her feet, the Compound is the better choice.</p>\n<p>So she takes her bots and their precious lizard Mother, and settles herself into the fortress of concrete and steel she\u2019d built for a team that had never truly wanted her.</p>\n<p>And then she turns herself towards the task they had not trusted her with the first time around.</p>\n<p>The Accords and the future of the Avengers.</p>\n<p>Because, no matter what else happens, Toni is a <em> goddess</em>, is the only goddess of this world, of these people.</p>\n<p>And that makes them hers to protect.</p>\n<p>Even the ones who don\u2019t believe in her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when the pain of Death writhing in her chest is calmer, a piece of Toni can't help but sneer at the bitter irony of her rebirth.</p>\n<p>By the circumstances of her mortal\u00a0life and all of the pain and the anguish that had followed it.</p>\n<p>Because hadn\u2019t she suffered under the rule of a faithless husband who became a careless father for long enough the first time? \u00a0Did her rebirth have to be shadowed by so much of the same?</p>\n<p>Did <em> Howard </em>have to follow Zeus?</p>\n<p>Did <em> Maria </em>have to follow Demeter?</p>\n<p>Was she cursed to forever cycle through so much of the same?</p>\n<p>Hadn\u2019t she suffered enough neglect and absent cruelty as Kore?</p>\n<p>Did it have to compound upon itself to become what Howard and Maria had inflicted upon her?</p>\n<p>In those moments Toni can\u2019t help but wonder what it is about her, about her very <em>soul</em>, that makes it so easy for the ones who should have loved her to turn from her instead.</p>\n<p>Is it some curse she never knew she carried?</p>\n<p>Did Hera, in her bitter rage, curse Kore as she had so many of Zeus\u2019 other bastard children?</p>\n<p>Did Toni carry that\u00a0blight on her soul\u00a0with her through all of the ages, through all of her lives?</p>\n<p>Or would all of this have happened regardless?</p>\n<p>Was she always fated to end up here?</p>\n<p>Toni can\u2019t decide what would be better.</p>\n<p>For all of the anguish she\u2019s suffered to have been the result of some divine curse she can not see let alone break.</p>\n<p>Or for it all to have been destiny of a sort, fate in some way.</p>\n<p>A byproduct of nothing more than who and what she is.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni presses forward as she always does. \u00a0Presses through the pain and the hurt and the sadness and does what she does best.</p>\n<p>She builds and creates her way forward.</p>\n<p>Three months out the other side of the Civil War and the Accords are rapidly taking shape beneath her, Vision, and Rhodey\u2019s influence as well as T\u2019Challa and other like minded individual's guidance.</p>\n<p>A week after the first amendment is signed into effect Toni does the one thing she hasn\u2019t allowed herself to do outside of the safety of her Tower.</p>\n<p>She picks a secluded corner of the Compound grounds and she builds herself a garden.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The garden becomes a special sort of escape for the three of them.</p>\n<p>Once they realize what she\u2019s doing in the large swath of space that\u2019s suddenly become encircled with towering holly hedges full to bursting with berries, Rhodey and Vision insist on helping her.</p>\n<p>So their rare free afternoons are spent there in Toni\u2019s newest sanctuary.</p>\n<p>They spend hours with her there, shovels in hand and dirt streaked across their faces despite the way Toni tells them there are quicker ways for her to get the pond she plans to put here or the small waterways she wants there.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe would like to help you build this, Toni,\u201d Vision tells her softly as he floats down to settle beside her on the thick grass. \u00a0\u201cTo aid you in this act of creation, as your family.\u201d</p>\n<p>JARVIS whispers his agreement in her ear even as Rhodey reaches out and rubs a dirt covered hand against her face with a laugh.</p>\n<p>Even Pepper and Happy get in on the situation. \u00a0Pepper having beautiful koi fish delivered for the pond once it\u2019s finished while Happy squabbles cheerfully with Rhodey about how to best build a bridge over the waterways.</p>\n<p>Toni just laughs, Vision on one side and Pepper on the other, as she coaxes vines and roots up and over the little streams in smooth arches.</p>\n<p>Both of them pout right up until Vision shows them the plans he made for the truly massive birdhouse he intends to build. \u00a0Then they\u2019re right back to arguing good naturedly.</p>\n<p>It only makes her love them more.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Not all of her time in the garden is so cheerful though.</p>\n<p>Toni finds herself there on the nights when she can\u2019t sleep, when Death rattles too violently inside of its cage.</p>\n<p>And on those nights everything Toni tries to bloom withers and dies in her hands, leaves shriveled, blossoms wilted and vines black with rot.</p>\n<p>Death twisting Life before it ever has a chance to be.</p>\n<p>In those moments she is reminded of just how <em> wrong </em>she is.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s storming the night Rhodey follows her to the garden, thunder cracking like cannon blows, lightning arcing through the sky like all of nature is alight with the fury that writhes within her.</p>\n<p>And maybe it is.</p>\n<p>Toni is a goddess after all, is Life, is Creation, and that is an aspect that touches <em> everything </em>even if lightning has never been hers to call.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Toni</em>!\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice calls out between thunder claps, echoing across the expanse of her garden.</p>\n<p>Curled into a ball against the trunk of the sprawling pomegranate tree she\u2019d been compelled to grow on the small island in the center of the pond, Toni says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Rhodey calls again, \u201cbaby girl, answer me!\u201d</p>\n<p>The lightning flashes again and Toni sees him, standing on the arch of the nearest bridge, soaked through with rain and face creased in worry.</p>\n<p>She hates seeing him so upset.</p>\n<p>Hates being the cause of it.</p>\n<p>So she stretches out her will, whispers a flicker of a wish to the garden, and waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Rhodey says a few moments later, exasperation and relief warring in his tone as he carefully brushes the flowers and vines that are still clinging to him from where they'd pulled him to her away, \u201cI kind of hate when you do that without warning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Toni does her best to summon a smile for him but she can tell from his expression that it doesn\u2019t come across as well as she\u2019d hoped.</p>\n<p>Her composure is flawless now when she wishes it to be but Toni has never really had shields where Rhodey is concerned. \u00a0Has never had the need to. There has never been anything about Rhodey that she\u2019s ever needed protection from.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby girl,\u201d Rhodey sighs as he sinks down onto the thick grass beside her, arm coming up to wrap around her shoulders as he draws her close to his chest. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni curls closer to him, uncaring of the way his bare chest is damp with rain.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s silent for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2026\u201d she swallows, tries to find the right words, \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey tenses against her, worry suddenly sharp in his voice.\u00a0 \"What do we need to do to fix it?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI did something, to Steve, to myself,\u201d Toni admits softly, \u201cand I \u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do, Rhodey. \u00a0I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do and it <em> hurts</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you, Tones,\u201d Rhodey says instantly, truth heavy and sure in every inch of him. \u00a0\u201cWhatever it is, whatever happened. I\u2019ll help you. We all will. You know that.\u00a0 So just, tell me what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI took Death from him, from Steve,\u201d Toni admits. \u00a0\u201cI pulled it from him and now it\u2019s inside of me and it\u2019s not <em> right</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey sucks in a sharp breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a <em>monster</em>, Rhodey.\u201d \u00a0Toni presses on. \u00a0\u201cI took his aspect from him, pulled the Death from him until he\u2019s Hades in memory and spirit only. \u00a0I\u2019m a goddess of Life and Death now, an avatar of two opposing aspects.\u00a0 And one of those is an aspect I stole from another god. \u00a0Zeus would have had me killed for what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Rhodey\u2019s voice is harsh as he pulls her away from his chest until they\u2019re looking each other in the eye. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t ever call yourself a monster again, Toni. Not ever. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re the goddess of, or how many aspects you have or whatever. \u00a0You don\u2019t ever say that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m sorry</em>,\u201d Toni swallows back a sudden rush of tears. \u00a0\u201cIt just \u2026 it <em> hurts</em>, Rhodey. \u00a0It hurts <em> so bad</em>. \u00a0Like nothing I\u2019ve ever \u2026 it\u2019s worse than anything I\u2019ve ever felt. \u00a0I\u2019m not meant to hold Death like this and it wants <em> out</em>. \u00a0It wants a new host.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen give it to me,\u201d Rhodey says.</p>\n<p>Toni freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s more of a breath than a whisper but somehow it\u2019s still loud, still echoes around them where they\u2019re pressed together in the dry, warm safety that exists beneath the tree Toni had blessed herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Rhodey repeats. \u00a0\u201cDeath or whatever it is. If it\u2019s hurting you so bad, if holding it\u2019s doing this kind of damage, causing you this kind of pain, then don\u2019t hold it anymore. \u00a0Give it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me on it, Toni,\u201d Rhodey cuts her off before she can say anything else. \u00a0\u201cI want it. I want to do this for you. Because it\u2019s me and you, baby girl, until the day we die. \u00a0And if that means becoming Death or a god or anything else, well, I made that choice years ago. Because I\u2019m gonna do whatever I have to do to stay by your side, to keep you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a split second Toni is breathless, speechless, and then she moves. \u00a0She throws herself across the small bit of space Rhodey had put between the two of them.</p>\n<p>And, as always, Rhodey just pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I love you</em>,\u201d Toni\u2019s voice breaks on a sob as she clutches Rhodey to her, face buried in his shoulder. \u00a0\u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shh</em>,\u201d Rhodey soothes her, one hand rubbing circles against her spine as the other comes up to cradle the back of her head. \u00a0\u201cOh Toni, baby, I love you too. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does.</p>\n<p>She really and truly does.</p>\n<p>Rhodey loves her and Toni loves Rhodey in return.</p>\n<p>She adores him with every inch of her being and has blessed him with Life to keep him by her side.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s one of the very reasons why she can\u2019t give him what he\u2019s asking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you Death,\u201d Toni whispers against his throat. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t hold it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey sounds puzzled. \u00a0\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I already gave you Life,\u201d Toni admits quietly. \u00a0\u201cSo you could stay with me, for as long as you want. It\u2019s why \u2026 it\u2019s why the fall didn\u2019t paralyze you, Rhodey. \u00a0Why you healed so quickly. Because I blessed you, right after the invasion. And someone blessed by Life can\u2019t hold Death. \u00a0Not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Rhodey sighs. \u00a0\u201cThank you, Toni, for saving me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'll always save you, Rhodey.\u00a0 Just like you always save me.\u00a0 Besides,\u201d Toni draws back a bit, manages to smile at him through her tears. \u00a0\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be Death anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey looks just the slightest bit offended. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d make a good god of Death or the Underworld or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Life and Death are <em> lovers</em>,\u201d Toni reminds him softly. \u00a0\u201cAnd you can\u2019t think about me and sex in the same sentence without getting that face,\u201d Rhodey grimaces in distaste and Toni can\u2019t help but smile, \u201cthat one right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the truth too.</p>\n<p>Their relationship is not and never will be what Death would require it to be.</p>\n<p>Life and Death are lovers after all, mated and married in all ways, and that will never be Toni and Rhodey.</p>\n<p>For all the love they have between them there has never been that spark, that blossom of <em> desire</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Rhodey finally admits defeat. \u00a0\u201cI guess at least I really will get to stay with you huh? \u00a0And we\u2019ll figure out a way to fix this Toni, I promise. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m gonna just sit back and let you suffer like this. \u00a0Not if I can help it. So we\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d is all Toni can think to say. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey doesn\u2019t say anything else, just pulls her even closer until she\u2019s sitting in his lap, and presses a kiss to her temple.</p>\n<p>They sit there together, watching the storm from beneath the safety of the tree.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Rhodey says after a moment, voice rueful, \u201cif I\u2019m remembering my mythology right, and I am cause I\u2019ve brushed up on it over the years since my best friend\u2019s an actual <em> goddess</em>, Zeus was a major dick. \u00a0So I wouldn\u2019t really hold much to his opinion if I were you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni can\u2019t help but laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she agrees softly. \u00a0\u201cYeah he really was.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence that falls between them again is soft and gentle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d \u00a0Toni finally whispers the question that still haunts her to him. \u00a0\u201cWhy did \u2026 why doesn\u2019t Steve want me anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything, Toni,\u201d Rhodey tells her, lips pressed against her hair. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. That\u2019s all there is to it. No matter what his reasoning may or may not be he\u2019s still an idiot for turning away from you. \u00a0All of them are damn fools.\u201d</p>\n<p>And laying there against Rhodey\u2019s chest, sheltered beneath the protective canopy of the pomegranate tree, Toni lets herself believe he\u2019s right.</p>\n<p>If even only for a moment.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Six months in and Toni wears flowers in her hair now.</p>\n<p>She glides her way through her garden and lets JARVIS whisper in her ear about which blossoms he wants her to wear for the day.</p>\n<p>So she wears black rosebuds and golden carnations and perfectly formed crimson lilies. \u00a0Once, just to see the smile on Rhodey and Vision\u2019s faces, JARVIS has her wear a wreath of forget-me-nots woven into her curls. \u00a0They\u2019re a vibrant electric blue that matches both her eyes and the glow of the arc reactor.</p>\n<p>Perfect blossoms in all of the colors that have come to define her in this life.</p>\n<p>The press has a field day, snaps photo after photo of her new accessories every time she makes a public appearance. \u00a0They rave on and on about where she might have gotten them, about the unusual and unnatural colors, about whether or not they\u2019re real or something she specifically had engineered.</p>\n<p>More than one tabloid and paper wonders about whether or not romance is in the Iron Queen\u2019s life because why else would she wear flowers in her hair again?</p>\n<p>The press is, as always, clueless as to the truth of Toni\u2019s motivations. \u00a0They don\u2019t understand the true symbolism of the blossoms in her hair or why Toni wears them.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t wear flowers in her hair for them anyways.</p>\n<p>She does it for JARVIS, for Rhodey and Vision, for Pepper and Happy.</p>\n<p>For her little family who knows her and smiles everytime they see her newest blossom, each fantastic in their own way.</p>\n<p>She does it for the bots who make her hair pins topped with trailing strings of metal flowers, each meticulously crafted.</p>\n<p>She does it for Harley who video calls her once a week and talks about going to school in New York. \u00a0Who saw photos of her in some tabloid or another and sent her an antique comb topped with a golden day lily that he saved to get for her for the anniversary of the day they met. \u00a0Toni wears it in her hair the next time she goes out and just laughs when he calls her back to scream about the busted up classic Camaro she had delivered to his house for him to fix up.</p>\n<p>She does it for the Spiderling who gives her street vendor flowers with half crushed petals without understanding Toni\u2019s true nature, without hearing even a <em> hint </em> about who and what she really is. \u00a0All the kid knows is that Toni has a thing for flowers, that they make her <em> smile</em>.</p>\n<p>And, most of all, she wears them for herself.</p>\n<p>For the Toni Stark she is now.</p>\n<p>For the Persephone she\u2019d once been.</p>\n<p>For the Kore that will always linger within her, just below the surface.</p>\n<p>She wears them because they are now, as they\u2019d once been, a crown she made all on her own.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>A year in and the newly formed Accords Committee does the one thing Toni has simultaneously been working towards and dreading.</p>\n<p>They call the Rogues home.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI will allow no harm to come to you, Miss,\u201d JARVIS warns her softly as they stand on the tarmac waiting for the quinjet to finish landing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know J,\u201d Toni answers softly even as she brings a hand up to cover the one Vision\u2019s laid on her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are family,\u201d Vision picks up on JARVIS\u2019 thread of conversation easily enough. \u00a0\u201cFamily protects their own.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hardness to Vision now that wasn\u2019t there before, a steadiness that had blossomed after Siberia.</p>\n<p>Toni loves him dearly even as she mourns the loss of so much of his innocence. \u00a0He\u2019s so young still. He should have never been faced with such burdens, such heartache.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst one to step a fucking <em> toe </em>out of line gets to meet me out back,\u201d Rhodey half snarls, his own rage over Siberia and what had come before still lingering.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Toni tells the three of them, \u201clike we always do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Vision agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether,\u201d JARVIS whispers in her ear.</p>\n<p>Toni loves them all so very much.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Once the fanfare is done and the press leaves Toni sees the way Steve\u2019s eyes catch on the flowers in her hair. \u00a0She sees the guilt that has become so much a part of him well up in his face for a split second before he banks it down.</p>\n<p>But, a year apart and the memory of his shield slamming down into her chest over and over again still lingering in her mind, the image of Sharon Carter in his arms lingering in her <em> heart</em>, Toni finds that she just \u2026 <em> doesn\u2019t care</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s surprisingly easy to pass him over.</p>\n<p>It also feels a little bit like freedom.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The first few days are the worst as the Rogues settle in.</p>\n<p>Barton\u2019s anger is like fire, hot and raging and uncontrollable. \u00a0Rhodey meets it head on with a sneer, his disdain cold enough to snuff out even the brightest of blazes.</p>\n<p>Maximoff\u2019s hatred for Toni is like a great scarlet wave. \u00a0Vision steps before it, before Toni, and plants himself like a mountain in Maximoff\u2019s path. \u00a0An immovable object to her attempts at being an unstoppable force.</p>\n<p>Toni isn\u2019t the same as she\u2019d once been, isn\u2019t as vulnerable to any of them really as she\u2019d been in the past, but she still appreciates the devotion her family shows her.</p>\n<p>Still cherishes their love and the protection they offer her so very easily.</p>\n<p>Romanov is cooler, calmer, but Toni isn\u2019t fooled by her any longer. \u00a0Isn\u2019t stupid enough to think that, despite everything, Romanov might actually have Toni\u2019s back on anything. \u00a0JARVIS handles her attempts to access any kind of classified information with a viciousness that makes Toni proud.</p>\n<p>It also leaves Romanov leery of anything electronic in the Compound for days afterwards. \u00a0Which is basically everything.</p>\n<p>Wilson and Lang are simpler, easier to deal with due to the lack of any real connection between them and Toni. A long look from Toni or Rhodey is enough to get both of them to back down. \u00a0Lang especially as he is, for some reason, abjectly terrified of both of them and Vision too.</p>\n<p>But surprisingly enough, or perhaps not, the one Toni has a hard time skipping past, is <em> Barnes</em>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something just a shade off right with him. \u00a0Something dark and shadowed.</p>\n<p>Clear headed, free from the rage and the betrayal that had clouded their last meeting, Toni can practically taste the way the shadows cling to him.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>And after a few days Toni realizes something profound about Barnes.</p>\n<p>James \"Bucky\" Barnes has been touched by Death.</p>\n<p>And some primal part of Toni finds that \u2026 <em> intriguing</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni has no real interest in fighting with the others unless they push her or her family.</p>\n<p>So the time she doesn\u2019t spend at press conferences or galas or locked in her workshop or curled up in Rhodey or Vision\u2019s rooms, she spends out in her garden.</p>\n<p>She tends to her plants or she settles down beneath the pomegranate tree and works on designs on a tablet with JARVIS in her ear.</p>\n<p>Sometimes she even lays out on one of the oversized lily pads and floats around the pond, eyes closed and a hand trailing in the water for the koi to nibble at her fingers. \u00a0The peace and safety of her garden settles over her like a balm so great that not even her still instinctive fear of being submerged can touch her.</p>\n<p>In this place, surrounded by her creations, Toni is <em> safe </em> in a way she\u2019s only ever found in Rhodey\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>A month or so into the new cold war that\u2019s settled over the Compound with the arrival of the Rogues Toni catches Barnes watching her.</p>\n<p>The potted plants that dot the Compound now, gifts from Happy and Pepper, whisper to Toni about him but Toni doesn\u2019t need them to.</p>\n<p>She can feel his eyes on her like the touch of fingertips down her spine.</p>\n<p>Unsure of what, exactly, he wants from her Toni ignores him as best she can.</p>\n<p>Toni has no interest in getting closer to yet another ghost chipped free from the ice, no matter what his intentions might or might not be.</p>\n<p>No matter how something inside of her thrums in awareness whenever he\u2019s nearby.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Another month filled with shitty training sessions and frigid silence between Toni\u2019s family and the Rogues passes.</p>\n<p>Another month of ignoring Steve\u2019s guilty glances and Maximoff\u2019s sneers.</p>\n<p>Another month of Barnes lingering on the edge of every room Toni\u2019s in, eyes watchful and curious.</p>\n<p>Another month of pain, harsh and spitting, as Death claws at her insides with renewed vigor. \u00a0There\u2019s an anger to it now that wasn\u2019t there before, a rage that unsettles Toni just a bit.</p>\n<p>Toni wonders how long this impasse they\u2019ve all settled into will last before the inevitable explosion.</p>\n<p>She wonders if she even cares about who, besides her family of course, will make it out of the blast.</p>\n<p>She wonders why she ever did in the first place.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It takes Barnes another two weeks before he finds his way to her garden.</p>\n<p>The holly hedges twitter to Toni about Barnes, about the man with the metal arm who watches her from a distance.</p>\n<p>Toni pushes down the memories of another man, dark and foreboding like Barnes himself, who\u2019d once watched her from a distance too.</p>\n<p>That was another life and Toni was, in so many ways, a different person then.</p>\n<p>Had made different choices.</p>\n<p>Once Kore had stepped freely into the Underworld, had found a beauty in what she saw there and decided to stay. \u00a0Had chosen love above all else and was gifted a kingdom in the process.</p>\n<p>Toni has no interest in doing the same thing again.</p>\n<p>Besides, touched by Death or not, Barnes is no <em> god</em>.</p>\n<p>He rules no Underworld, he has no aspect.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s more than a mortal of course, the serum guarantees that, but he\u2019s not <em> divine</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni ignores the part of herself, that hungry primal part, that says he so easily could be.</p>\n<p>She is Life, is Creation.</p>\n<p>There is little she cannot do if she wills it.</p>\n<p>If she wants.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Toni speaks up without even bothering to turn, her attention firmly on her tablet, \u201cwhatever it is you want from me, isn\u2019t going to happen if you don\u2019t speak up.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think I want anything from you?\u201d \u00a0Barnes\u2019 voice is deep, raspy, a hint of an accent decidedly <em> not </em>Brooklyn in origin clinging to every word.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a stark contrast to how he\u2019s sounded the few times she\u2019s heard him speak around the others.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t help but wonder what that says about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody wants something out of me,\u201d Toni points out with a deliberate sort of careless honesty. \u201cNo reason for you to be here otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Barnes says after a long moment of silence. \u00a0\u201cFor what I did. To you, to everybody HYDRA ever pointed me at. \u00a0I\u2019d take it back if I could. But I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s eyes drift shut for a split second.</p>\n<p>She breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a weapon, Barnes, a gun,\u201d Toni finally says. \u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault what HYDRA chose to make you do. Who they made you hurt. \u00a0All you can do now is pick up the pieces and make sure that the only hands that fire you from now on are your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barnes doesn\u2019t say anything to that.</p>\n<p>Instead he stares at her for a few, silent minutes, and then he leaves.</p>\n<p>Toni doesn\u2019t watch him go but the flowers whisper to her of his passing all the same.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me the word,\u201d JARVIS says softly in her ear the third time Barnes breeches the edge of her garden, \u201cand I will make him disappear for you, Miss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright J,\u201d Toni tells him with a small smile even as she leans on the vine bench she\u2019d crafted against the trunk of the pomegranate tree. \u00a0\u201cPretty sure Rhodey\u2019s got dibs anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sure Colonel Rhodes would be inclined to share,\u201d JARVIS tells her waspishly.</p>\n<p>Toni just smiles again and then wipes her expression clear as she settles in to wait.</p>\n<p>A few moments later Barnes steps beneath the canopy of the tree. \u00a0He naturally lingers in the shadows of the branches but Toni can see those blue-grey eyes focused on her intensely all the same.</p>\n<p>For a moment they just stare at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe others say you and Steve are gods,\u201d Barnes finally breaks the silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cGossipy little things aren\u2019t they?\u201d \u00a0Toni snips back. \u201cI bet they\u2019ve told you all sorts of things about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey say you\u2019re Hades reborn.\u201d \u00a0Barnes replies bluntly, head tilted a bit to the side but eyes still almost wolf like in their watchfulness. \u00a0\u201cThat you\u2019re Death and Steve\u2019s Life. That you\u2019re dark and dangerous and that I shouldn\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo they now?\u201d \u00a0Toni lets a smile, razor sharp and vicious, blossom across her crimson painted mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re full of shit,\u201d Barnes says.</p>\n<p>Toni goes still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Steve for almost a century now,\u201d Barnes says as he steps even further beneath the canopy. \u00a0\u201cAnd in all of that time the only things he could ever make come to life was his art and fist fights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere a point to this little history lesson of yours?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks even as she feels the way her heart begins to pound in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got out from under HYDRA\u201d Barnes keeps going, \u201cand I stepped out into the world as a person instead of an Asset for the first time in \u2026 <em> decades</em>. \u00a0And everywhere I looked ... there you were. \u00a0Your company, the armor, some new revolutionary tech in this field or that one. \u00a0All of it with your name on the side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour <em> point</em>,\u201d Toni stresses again.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point is that I look at the world these days and all I see are your creations,\u201d Barnes tells her. \u00a0\u201cAnd I can\u2019t understand why anyone would ever think you\u2019re anything, anyone, but Life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath shudders in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>Oh</em>,\u2019 Toni thinks just a tad bit thrown, \u2018<em>oh</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Toni finally manages to say. \u00a0\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? I\u2019m the Merchant of Death. Sounds pretty obvious to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d Barnes says as he steps even closer until he\u2019s hovering right beside where Toni\u2019s sitting, \u201cbombs and guns have to be created too. \u00a0And everyone knows SI wasn\u2019t just about weapons, even before you put on the armor. Intelli-crops right? That\u2019s what you call them isn\u2019t it? Those engineered plants of yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni says nothing, just stares up at Barnes, expression blank and head tilted up proudly.</p>\n<p>Barnes stares right back at her for a long moment before he takes a slow step forward and leans down closer to her. \u00a0They\u2019re a handful of inches apart as he reaches out to place something on the vine crafted bench beside her, the black and gold of his new arm glinting in the fading sun.</p>\n<p>Toni doesn\u2019t look down, just keeps her eyes trained on him.</p>\n<p>He stays there for a long moment, eyes half lidded and hair swinging down to brush against his jawline, before he finally blinks and straightens back up.</p>\n<p>Then, with one last nod in her direction, Barnes turns and walks away.</p>\n<p>Heart pounding, Toni waits until the holly hedges whisper that he\u2019s left the garden before she looks down.</p>\n<p>And there, on the seat of the bench beside her, is a single asphodel blossom.</p>\n<p>When Toni reaches out to touch its petals her hands <em> shake</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>After that it\u2019s as if some sort of signal has been given to Barnes because he\u2019s around every corner Toni turns now.</p>\n<p>But, unlike Steve who still stares at her guiltily every time they\u2019re in the same room together, Toni doesn\u2019t ignore or try to avoid him.</p>\n<p>There is something about him, something that Toni thinks she almost recognizes.</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s one more very important thing about Barnes.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s nearby the Death inside of Toni is calmer, quieter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost \u2026 <em> nice</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Eventually Barnes slinks his way down to her workshop under the guise of arm maintenance that they both know he doesn\u2019t need.</p>\n<p>Bemused, Toni lets him inside anyways.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wide eyed and almost gleeful as he takes in the holograms and the projections, the display cases with the first iterations of the armor in them that Toni has kept for a number of reasons and her various tools and gadgets.</p>\n<p>And then he sees the bots.</p>\n<p>Toni watches, breathless, as he holds his metal arm out at his side, a small smile creasing his face as he lets DUM-E and U inspect it.</p>\n<p>Her heart clenches sharply in her chest at the way he doesn\u2019t get upset when the ever rage filled Butterfingers reaches up and tugs harshly at his hair with one hand while the other clicks angrily in his face.</p>\n<p>Instead Barnes just laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he faux whispers to Butterfingers but those bright eyes of his are trained on Toni instead, \u201cI ain\u2019t here to cause trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni isn\u2019t all that sure if he's telling the truth.</p>\n<p>But she also isn't sure that he's lying either.</p>\n<p>A part of her is pretty sure that Barnes might not be aiming to cause trouble in so much as he <em>is</em> trouble.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another asphodel blossom waiting on her workbench after he leaves.</p>\n<p>Toni didn\u2019t see him drop it but she can\u2019t help the way she brings it up to her face for a split second before she stops herself.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t throw it away though.</p>\n<p>Can\u2019t bring herself to for some reason or another.</p>\n<p>Instead she tucks it into the vase beside the other now eternally fresh flower he\u2019d given her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Steve tries to stop her in the hall a day or so later, reaches out and wraps gentle fingers around her wrist as she walks past him.</p>\n<p>Toni stops, looks down at where he\u2019s holding her, and then back up at him, eyes narrowing sharply.</p>\n<p>In her chest something <em> dark </em>and <em>deadly</em> rattles with vicious intent.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Steve starts to say, \u201cI wanted to tal-\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve cuts himself off with a sharp yelp, dropping her wrist as he pulls his now bleeding hand away from her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Toni tells him softly, voice dangerously even, \u201ctouch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t bother to wait around to see what he wanted.</p>\n<p>Instead Toni walks away, head tilting to the side to allow the loop of jade vine flowers she\u2019d been wearing around her wrist to creep up and settle in her hair instead.</p>\n<p>She leaves Steve bleeding behind her.</p>\n<p>Just as he had once left her.</p>\n<p>Toni thinks maybe it should feel like some small smatter of justice.</p>\n<p>It doesn't.</p>\n<p>All it really makes her feel is <em> tired</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Barnes?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks her one lazy afternoon between meeting and training and his ever present war with not snapping Barton or any of the rest of them in half. \u00a0\u201cJARVIS said he\u2019s been showing up here and don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t seen him staring at you around the Compound. Hell he spends half our training sessions staring at you. \u00a0Way he\u2019s going he\u2019s gonna lose that other arm if he ain\u2019t careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re laid out in her garden on the sunlit edge of the pond. \u00a0Her hair\u2019s down and flowing across his lap as he weaves flowers into the great mass of silken curls.</p>\n<p>Off to the side Vision floats lazily in the air, sketchbook in hand as he draws the various birds that come and go from the little community of bird mansions he, Rhodey, and Happy keep adding to.</p>\n<p>Toni resolves to grow even more things to draw in more wildlife. \u00a0Vision will, she\u2019s sure, appreciate a small butterfly haven.</p>\n<p>All in all it\u2019s a peaceful moment that Toni wants to last forever even as she knows it won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not that lucky, goddess or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Toni answers him honestly. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just \u2026 <em> there</em>. \u00a0Every time I turn around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe bothering you?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks with a deliberate sort of nonchalance.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni smiles as her eyes drift closed. \u00a0\u201cYou and J can stand down, honey-bear. Barnes is \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what he is, exactly, but I don\u2019t think he wants to hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey\u2019s hands are gentle as he strokes his fingertips across her temples. \u00a0The leather and spice scent of him carries the smallest hint of something green and growing now, the mark of her blessing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe knows what I am. \u00a0<em> Who </em>I am,\u201d Toni admits softly as she opens her eyes to stare up into Rhodey\u2019s face. \u00a0\u201cHe just \u2026 he said he couldn\u2019t see how anyone could think I was anything but Life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something complicated and fierce flashes across Rhodey face before it softens, fades into something that looks almost like acceptance. \u00a0Toni isn\u2019t sure what, exactly, he\u2019s thinking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cBout time somebody else around here proved they aren\u2019t a total fucking idiot.\u201d \u00a0He finally settles on saying. \u201cBut I\u2019ll still drop kick his ass into the sun if he fucks up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you will,\u201d Toni agrees. \u00a0\u201cThough JARVIS might find a way to beat you to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be my genuine pleasure, Miss,\u201d JARVIS says firmly in her ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and J can share,\u201d Rhodey compromises. \u00a0\u201cHe can chart the trajectory and I\u2019ll do the kicking. \u00a0It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch <em> violence</em>,\u201d Toni teases softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much we wouldn\u2019t do to keep you safe, Tones,\u201d Rhodey says seriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d \u00a0Toni smiles up at him, chest warm despite the ever present pain. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2026 he brings me flowers Rhodey. Asphodels. One each time he finds me here or in the workshop. \u00a0I don\u2019t know why, but he brings me flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of drawn out silence between them as Rhodey brings another blue petaled rose up to weave into her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s really not an idiot after all,\u201d Rhodey muses, voice absent as his fingers move, \u201cguess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the story,\u201d Barnes asks quietly from where he\u2019s sitting a few feet away from her on the floor of the workshop. \u00a0There\u2019s a thin paperback book in his flesh hand and his metal arm is propped up on his knee so that he and DUM-E can keep playing whatever strange new hand game they\u2019ve come up with now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich story?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks absently as she manipulates the hologram in front of her, humming agreeably as JARVIS inlays the automated corrections they\u2019d hashed out earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one about how you and Stevie first met,\u201d Barnes says.</p>\n<p>Toni goes still for a split second before she forces herself to keep going, hands sliding across the projections in front of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cFigured someone would have told you all about the invasion and the helicarrier by now,\u201d Toni answers lightly, attention purposefully focused on her work. \u00a0\u201cGossipy as they all are.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter though.</p>\n<p>As always she can feel Barnes\u2019 eyes on her back like fingertips trailing down her spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that story,\u201d Barnes clarifies even though they both know she knew that to begin with.</p>\n<p>They both know just what Barnes is asking her to talk about.</p>\n<p>Just what tale he wants her to weave for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Red Dawn,\u201d Toni slants a look at him over her shoulder, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to level up a bit more before you unlock my tragic backstory. \u00a0That or ask your BFF. Maybe he\u2019ll tell you the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s bitterness is apparent but they both know that Steve isn\u2019t going to tell anyone, not even Barnes, the truth. \u00a0Isn\u2019t going to acknowledge what he\u2019s spent so long ignoring.</p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t going to admit to what he has and has not done where he and Toni are concerned.</p>\n<p>So if Barnes wants to know the story then he can do his research, as flawed as it will inevitably be with the way the truth has become twisted and changed over time. \u00a0Fact becoming myth, becoming legend and fairy tale through some kind of giant, historic game of telephone.</p>\n<p>Whispering the truth behind the lies to Barnes isn\u2019t something Toni feels like doing at the moment.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni finds her asphodel, the one she won\u2019t outright admit to always being on the lookout for after Barnes leaves the workshop or the garden.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s tucked between the pages of Barnes\u2019 book.</p>\n<p>Toni plucks the flower from the book carefully and slides it behind her ear.</p>\n<p>For safekeeping of course.</p>\n<p>No other reason.</p>\n<p>The book she gives to Butterfingers who is more than happy to rip it into a shower of confetti once she gives him the go ahead.</p>\n<p>She might not be willing to tell Barnes the true story at the moment, if ever, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll allow garbage like what he was reading into her workshop.</p>\n<p><em> The Rape of Persephone </em> indeed.</p>\n<p>Such propagandist bullshit.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with all the flowers, Stark?\u201d Barton asks when they\u2019re all packed in the back of one of Toni\u2019s massive limousines after a day of playing nice in front of the press. \u00a0His eyes are trained on the line of trailing metal snapdragon blossoms that sway off of one of the hair sticks the bots had made her and the gloriously vibrant dwarf sunflower JARVIS had chosen for her that morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your business Barton,\u201d Toni cuts back calmly, fingers dancing across her tablet screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Barton bites out lowly. \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t make conversation these days? \u00a0Or are you too good to talk to the rest of us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh she\u2019s definitely too good to talk to you, Barton,\u201d Rhodey cuts in from her right, hand coming up to play idly with his tie and the small but brilliant crimson phlox flower that\u2019s been pinned there. \u00a0\u201cBut if you wanna have a conversation that bad I\u2019ll be free for the rest of the afternoon. We can spend some quality time in the gym again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barton scowls but doesn\u2019t rise to Rhodey\u2019s obvious challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably just trying to get Steve\u2019s attention anyways,\u201d he mutters as he settles back into his seat between Romanov and Maximoff.</p>\n<p>Beside Toni, lip curled up in a small sneer, Rhodey snorts and goes to say something again only to be cut off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThought your name was Hawkeye?\u201d \u00a0Barnes cuts in from where he\u2019s half sprawled beside Steve and, coincidentally, directly across from Toni. \u00a0\u201cMight wanna get those eyes checked, <em> boy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The limousine goes silent and when Toni looks up from her tablet Barnes is staring directly at her, eyes half lidded but bright.</p>\n<p>Beside him Steve\u2019s hands are clenched so tightly against his knees that his knuckles have gone white.</p>\n<p>Further down the seat, a flash of interest slides across Romanov\u2019s face before she brushes it away.</p>\n<p>Rhodey settles back against the seat again, an arm thrown casually across Toni\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>When she glances up at him, brows arched in question, he just winks and goes back to playing with a few loose curls that have escaped her admittedly massive bun.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>A day or two later Romanov tries to slither snake like into Toni\u2019s garden.</p>\n<p>Toni, relaxed atop a lily pad with Vision\u2019s head in her lap as Rhodey floats peacefully in the water beside them, doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>The holy hedges won\u2019t let her in anyways.</p>\n<p>Toni has many creatures living in her garden, from swarms of ladybugs and bees to more than one large writing spider who spins her delightfully intricate webs everyday.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no room for Black Widows in the tranquility Toni has built for herself and her family.</p>\n<p>No room for people Toni cannot trust inside of the sanctuary they have created.</p>\n<p>The holly hedges twitter and sigh as Barnes slides in a few minutes later looking more than a bit smug.</p>\n<p>Toni ignores what, exactly, that says about how she sees him.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Barnes doesn\u2019t ask after his book the next time he comes down to the workshop.</p>\n<p>Instead he just smiles, a barely there whisper of an expression.</p>\n<p>And when he leaves, Toni\u2019s asphodel is left resting safely on Butterfingers\u2019 support strut.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Steve calls out to her as she moves through the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Toni asks as she pauses and turns to look at him, a cup of coffee in one hand and a large bag of the hard candies Barnes seems to prefer in the other. \u00a0The container in the workshop is empty. <em> Again</em>.</p>\n<p>Steve comes to a stop a few feet away from her, hands pointedly held up in the air at his sides.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a smart move because the Death that\u2019s been rattling around inside of her hasn\u2019t grown any less viscous when he\u2019s around.</p>\n<p>If anything it\u2019s grown progressively angrier.</p>\n<p>That coupled with the blue-grey petunias she\u2019s wearing around her wrist means that it\u2019s better if Steve keeps some distance between the two of them.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s composure is second to none these days in most cases but there are other forces at work within and around her at the moment.</p>\n<p>And petunias are, to be completely honest, <em> spectacular </em>assholes.</p>\n<p>Which, in hindsight, is probably why Rhodey likes them so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we could,\u201d Steve stops, clears his throat, and pushes forward, \u201cI wanted to talk to you. \u00a0About \u2026 about a lot of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni stares up at him silently for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d \u00a0She finally asks, voice dangerously soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0Steve looks taken aback.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat. Is. My. Name?\u201d \u00a0Toni spaces each word out deliberately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Steve swallows, \u201cPe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lang turns the corner into the kitchen then and stumbles to a wide eyed halt at the sight of them squared off against each other.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s mouth snaps abruptly shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Toni prompts him. \u00a0\u201c What\u2019s the matter? Three-headed dog got your tongue?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Steve sighs, that familiar and <em> hated </em>guilt in his eyes, \u201cplease just \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni cuts him off with a raised hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s just what I thought you\u2019d say.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then she turns on her heel and saunters back out of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t eat the fruit here do you?\u201d \u00a0Barnes asks a few days later.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in the garden again of course. \u00a0Toni\u2019s settled on the bench beneath the pomegranate tree and Barnes is laid back on the grass a few feet away from her, face in shadows and hands behind his head.</p>\n<p>Toni looks up at the tree that is, as always, full to bursting with fat, ripe pomegranates, the skins of the fruits a deep, rich crimson in color.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni tells him softly. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t eat pomegranates anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost feels inevitable really, what happens.</p>\n<p>Rhodey\u2019s gone for the week, off to a conference with the Air Force, and it\u2019s Vision\u2019s turn on the rotation of checking in with the UN in person. \u00a0They\u2019d protested, viciously, against leaving her at the Compound alone.</p>\n<p>Toni had shooed them away with a pointed tap to her earpiece, her permanent connection to JARVIS, and a reminder of the fact that she could have the armor to her in <em> seconds </em>if anything happened.</p>\n<p>Some things had to come before their desire to stay together and this was, unfortunately, one of them.</p>\n<p>Besides, Toni is the Iron Queen, is <em> the </em> Stark, is a <em> goddess</em>, fear of confrontation and danger doesn\u2019t stop her from doing anything. \u00a0It never really has.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t wish one or the both of them were with her at the moment.</p>\n<p>Because it <em> hurts </em>so badly.</p>\n<p>Death thrashing in her chest, agony arcing through her like lightning, Toni hangs limply in the armor\u2019s arms as JARVIS engages the suit\u2019s reserve power and uses it to carry her silently through the Compound.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be alright, Miss,\u201d JARVIS whispers in her ear, voice soft and soothing. \u00a0\u201cThis will pass, as it always does. I will get you to the garden and this will pass. \u00a0I swear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry,\u201d Toni whispers before she bites at the inside of her cheek until she tastes blood in order to keep from screaming.</p>\n<p>And that, of course, is when Barnes chooses to melt out of the shadows of the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d \u00a0Barnes bites the words out, accent thick, as he steps in front of the armor. \u00a0\u201c<em>Lepestok</em>, what\u2019s wrong? \u00a0Did someone attack you?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something vicious and deadly in his voice then.</p>\n<p>\u201cMove, Sergeant Barnes,\u201d JARVIS\u2019 voice is harsh and cold as it spills out of the armor\u2019s external speakers. \u00a0\u201cOr I will not hesitate to <em> go through you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barnes steps to the side and lets the armor pass but he keeps pace with it, striding alongside as JARVIS makes it out onto the grounds. \u00a0Even when JARVIS takes to the air, relying on the back thrusters to keep them balanced, Toni can see Barnes following below them at a steady clip, face tilted up as he watches their progress.</p>\n<p>JARVIS sets them down on the edge of the pond a minute or so later. \u00a0The hands of the armor are exquisitely gentle as he places her on the grass and then smooths the hair that\u2019s fallen from her bun back away from her face.</p>\n<p>Toni buries her fingers in grass that blackens and then regrows and then blackens again rapidly at her touch. \u00a0She sees the world around her as if through a haze, grey seeping in around the edges and pain eating at her with every breath she takes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d \u00a0Barnes is there in the next second, dropping silently to his knees beside her, flesh hand reaching out towards her face like he can\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>The whine of the repulsor charging up is loud in the calm of the garden.</p>\n<p>\u201cStep away from her,\u201d JARVIS orders, one of the armor\u2019s gauntlets held only inches away from Barnes\u2019 temple. \u00a0\u201cI will not allow you to harm her. She has suffered enough at the hands of ungrateful interlopers as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Barnes bites out softly, \u201cI know I\u2019ve only got half the story. \u00a0And I know Stevie and the others \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the fuck is wrong with them but I know they\u2019ve hurt her. \u00a0I know I did too. But you\u2019ve got to trust me when I say I will <em> never </em>hurt her again, not like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why should I believe you?\u201d JARVIS demands, gauntlet not wavering an inch.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I know death, lived and breathed it under HYDRA\u2019s thumb, and she\u2019s not that. \u00a0She\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve seen in a <em> century</em>,\u201d Barnes voice is low, raspy, but he makes steady and even eye contact with the armor\u2019s helmet. \u00a0\u201cInside and out. She\u2019s \u2026 <em> precious</em>. \u00a0And I don\u2019t have a lot left in my life that I would consider either.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of tense silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not cause me to regret this trust, Sergeant Barnes,\u201d JARVIS says as he lowers the armor\u2019s arm. \u00a0\u201cBe gentle with her, she is ... <em> sensitive </em>in these moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Barnes nods and then he reaches out his hand and glides the tips of his fingers across the arc of Toni\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>His fingertips are soft and warm, the serum healing any calluses away before they can form.</p>\n<p>Toni chokes out a gasp at the touch, back arching up off of the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Barnes bites out as he snatches his hand away from her. \u00a0\u201cFuck, <em>lepestok</em>, petal, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni lashes a hand out and grabs Barnes\u2019 flesh hand in her own, tangles their fingers together and refuses to let them go.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Toni pants out, senses flooding with endorphins and mind <em> whirling</em>. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t go, Barnes. \u00a0Stay. <em> Stay</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Barnes says as he squeezes her hand gently. \u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m hurting you, so you need to let me go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni manages to say, \u201cno. \u00a0Barnes, <em> James</em>, please.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s as close to begging as Toni has come in longer than she can remember. \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, when you touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>As soon as Barnes\u2019 skin had touched hers Death had calmed, had stopped thrashing and instead almost seemed to purr.</p>\n<p>Even now, with her hand in his, it\u2019s <em> calm</em>.</p>\n<p>The cessation of pain makes Toni feel abruptly and totally <em> drunk</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold her,\u201d JARVIS commands then. \u00a0\u201cIf your touch brings comfort then you <em> will </em>hold her.\u201d</p>\n<p>And before Toni can even think to protest on principle alone, Barnes is moving.</p>\n<p>He scoops Toni up off of the ground and settles her down in his lap, face pressed against the warm expanse of his bare chest and their fingers still tangled together. \u00a0Beneath her ear his heart beats fast and heavy.</p>\n<p>Toni huffs out a weak chuckle and takes the opportunity to breathe in the scent of him, gun oil, leather, and something cold and sharp like mint, and relish being pain free.</p>\n<p>Barnes holds her there on the grass of the garden, JARVIS standing guard over them in the armor, for the longest time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he finally breaks the silence, \u201cI\u2019ll hold you for as long as you want, but I think it might be a good idea if someone tells me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni knows he\u2019s right, knows that he deserves at least the bare bones of an explanation.</p>\n<p>But she\u2019s so <em> tired</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cJ,\u201d Toni sighs, \u201ctell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure, Miss?\u201d \u00a0JARVIS questions, protectiveness in every syllable.</p>\n<p>Toni just gives him a thumbs up and turns her face further against Barnes\u2019 chest. \u00a0She\u2019s exhausted even if she isn\u2019t hurting anymore, and all she wants in this moment is to sleep. \u00a0To no longer worry about all of the things that drag at her during the day. All of the hurt and the bitterness and the unrelenting <em> pain</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d JARVIS agrees. \u00a0\u201cThis Sergeant Barnes, is what happens when promises are not kept. \u00a0This is the result of the cowardice of your <em> Captain</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStevie did this to her?\u201d \u00a0Barnes\u2019 arms tighten around her for a split second, his muscles tensing and the vents of his metal arm hissing angrily.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a way,\u201d JARVIS agrees. \u00a0\u201cThe Miss is, as you know, <em> Life</em>. \u00a0And Life is not meant to carry Death. \u00a0But your Captain was no longer worthy and so she took it from him. \u00a0And now it torments her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain.\u201d \u00a0Barnes bites the word out.</p>\n<p>And so JARVIS does.</p>\n<p>Toni fades in and out as the conversation carries on, aware only of the steady, comforting sound of JARVIS\u2019 voice and the rhythmic beat of Barnes\u2019 heart beneath her ear.</p>\n<p>Occasionally Barnes\u2019 speaks too, his voice a harsh, sharp rumble beneath her ear.</p>\n<p>But otherwise Toni just \u2026 <em> floats</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The world around her is a haze and Toni feels as if she\u2019s gliding through it, lighter than air.</p>\n<p>She thinks she might be moving, but she\u2019s too tired to really focus on it.</p>\n<p>Besides she can hear the familiar thump of the armor striding along beside her so she knows she\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p>JARVIS will watch over her, as he always does.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the way you say my name, flower,\u201d Barnes whispers, voice coming to her as is from a distance as he curls her closer to his chest. \u00a0\u201cSay it again, <em> please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJames,\u201d Toni whispers softly as sleep begins to raise up and take her away again. \u00a0\u201c<em>James</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni wakes up in her own bed.</p>\n<p>She feels rested, feels calm and content in a way she hasn\u2019t truly felt since before she\u2019d begun to pull the Death from Steve\u2019s bones. \u00a0She\u2019s warm and comfortable and the scent of flowers is heavy in the air around her.</p>\n<p>When she turns her head she finds that the pillow beside her is covered in asphodel blossoms. \u00a0Each one perfectly formed and gloriously fragrant.</p>\n<p>Across the bed the armor stands in the corner, JARVIS watching over her in a very physical sense.</p>\n<p>And when she looks to her other side Barn-<em> James </em> is there.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on the floor, side propped against her bed, and flesh arm stretched up across the mattress so that their fingers are still tangled together.</p>\n<p>Toni lays there for the longest time and watches him sleep.</p>\n<p>And when something soft and sweet and <em> lovely </em>blossoms to life inside of her chest, Toni doesn\u2019t even try to fight it.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey and Vision are both back in the Compound by early that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Toni knows as soon as she sees them that JARVIS has already told them about what happened.</p>\n<p>But, wrapped in Rhodey\u2019s arms and with Vision hovering protectively over both of them, she can hardly complain.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Almost as if her vulnerability has shifted something within him, there\u2019s an even more pronounced sort of softness to James whenever he looks at her now.</p>\n<p>A gentleness that isn\u2019t at all at odds with that hint of something dark and almost <em> hungry </em>that occasionally slides across his expression.</p>\n<p>Instead the two go hand in hand, a perfectly harmonious sort of duality.</p>\n<p>Toni does her best to pretend like she doesn\u2019t find that vastly appealing.</p>\n<p>She fails.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The next time Toni sees Rogers he\u2019s sporting a rapidly healing black eye and what looks like a broken nose.</p>\n<p>Toni just blinks, looks past him to where James is standing, arms crossed and glowering, and then goes on her way.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the story,\u201d James says softly from where he\u2019s sitting on the ground just beside Toni\u2019s feet. \u00a0He\u2019s sun dappled thanks to the shadows of the canopy but he seems content if the way his metal fingers card carefully through the thick grass that grows beneath the pomegranate tree is anything to go by.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someone to tuck you in for nap time,\u201d Toni snips back idly as she weaves the stems of the flowers that had crept to her side together into a crown, \u201cthen I hate to tell you this but you\u2019re in the wrong place, Freezerburn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d take another nap with you any day, petal,\u201d James cuts a look up at her, a sharp smirk curling its way across his lips. \u00a0The warm, gentle fingers he has wrapped around her ankle squeeze softly. \u201cEspecially under better circumstances than last time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlattery will get you nowhere, Jim-jam,\u201d Toni says evenly as she ignores the way her heart skips a beat and then begins to thunder. \u00a0Instead she focuses on weaving her golden roses and crimson irises and black lilies together.</p>\n<p>She ignores the way a few grey-blue cabbage roses sneak their way into the pile.</p>\n<p>Toni braids them into the crown all the same of course but she doesn\u2019t let herself think too deeply as to <em> why</em>.</p>\n<p>All the while Death turns loose, <em> smug</em>, spirals in her chest.</p>\n<p>And for the second time in what feels like a decade, Toni doesn\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Rogers stops her again just outside the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d Toni asks without giving him the opportunity to say anything else.</p>\n<p>Toni gives him ten seconds, five more than she perhaps should have, and then she walks away.</p>\n<p>She has no time for Rogers\u2019 silences, for his cowardice.</p>\n<p>For him.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey and Vision corner James in the garden one afternoon.</p>\n<p>Toni watches the three of them from a distance as they linger together by the pond\u2019s edge, Vision and Rhodey\u2019s expressions stern and James\u2019 some mix of amused and accepting.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re too far away for her to hear and Toni purposefully doesn\u2019t listen to the whispers of the lily pads.</p>\n<p>Rhodey had asked for some measure of privacy, something about him and Vision doing their <em> jobs</em>, and Toni had agreed.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s actually pretty sure they might be actively threatening James even if she\u2019s not exactly sure <em> why</em>.</p>\n<p>Either way she\u2019s willing to go along with it for now.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll pry it out of one of them eventually.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni knows that, as irritating as it may be, the world needs to see all of them playing nice during more than just press conferences.</p>\n<p>Thus the gala she and all of the others are attending, a charity event put on by the Edwin Jarvis Foundation and attended by all of high society and the newly reunited Avengers.</p>\n<p>Toni understands the importance, understands just how much impact a few photos and some gossip from one of these things can be.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why she\u2019s here, dressed to kill in a flowing golden gown with inlaid flower and vine details, her hair up and sprinkled with crimson rose buds, and her eyes highlighted boldly in gold and crimson.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t mean she has to enjoy it though.</p>\n<p>Her one act of rebellion had been to arrive just a bit late with Rhodey and Vision in tow instead of riding in with the others.</p>\n<p>\u201cI find myself still wondering as to the appeal of these events,\u201d Vision says evenly as they spin around the dance floor.</p>\n<p>Maximoff is glowering at them from across the way but Toni resolutely doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cRich people like to be around other rich people,\u201d Toni tells him as she smooths her hand across the shoulder of his burgundy floral patterned jacket. \u00a0\u201cBill it as a charity event and we can all get together and feel better about ourselves in the process. At least some good comes out of these dog and pony shows though. \u00a0Enough champagne and a few good cases of one-upmanship and we can get a lot done. I\u2019ve seen people donate themselves into a new tax bracket out of pettiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds rather unfortunate,\u201d Vision comments lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSunset Bain deserved every second of it,\u201d Toni waves his concern off as the song ends. \u00a0Toni tucks her hand into the crook of Visions elbow and lets him lead her back towards the edge of the dance floor where Rhodey\u2019s already waiting for them, champagne glasses in hand. \u00a0\u201cJARVIS does excellent work stirring up rumors when he wants to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs always, Miss,\u201d JARVIS quips lightly in her ear, \u201cyou flatter me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhose life is JARVIS ruining now?\u201d Rhodey asks as he passes Toni a flute.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was telling Vision about the Sunset Bain thing,\u201d Toni tells him. \u00a0\u201cRemember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe auction?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks with no small degree of relish.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d \u00a0Toni confirms.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah</em>,\u201d Rhodey nods sagely, expression creased in a smug sort of remembrance. \u201cGood times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni hums in agreement as he eyes scan the crowd only to stop on Rogers. \u00a0He\u2019s standing across the way, Wilson on one side of him. They\u2019re both decked out in black tuxedoes but Rogers is staring directly at Toni, a determined look on his face.</p>\n<p>Toni absolutely will not allow him to cause a scene at this gala. \u00a0Pepper would have all of their heads, hers included if that happened, divinity be damned.</p>\n<p>\u201cDance with me, Rhodey,\u201d Toni says as she knocks back the rest of her champagne and hands the flute off to a passing waiter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re avoiding Rogers again?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks as he leads her out onto the floor with practiced ease.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you know me so well, sugar drop,\u201d Toni agrees as she trails her fingers up the chest of his silver and black jacket, tracing over the floral designs he\u2019s also wearing, attention caught by the small bits of gold in the designs.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d Rhodey admits as they move together without even really thinking about it, \u201cI\u2019d hate to have to kick Captain America\u2019s ass in front of all these witnesses. \u00a0Pepper\u2019d be <em> pissed</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s something none of us want to experience unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Toni admits with a small shudder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmen to that,\u201d Rhodey agrees adamantly.</p>\n<p>They settle into the dance quietly after that, trading idle chatter and just enjoying being together until the song ends. \u00a0Toni\u2019s perfectly ready to move directly into the next song with Rhodey when he suddenly sighs, shakes his head just a bit, and takes a step back and away from her.</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks, brow arched high in question.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure you\u2019ve got another partner all lined up, baby girl,\u201d Rhodey tells her, something rueful and just a tad bit amused in his face. \u00a0He nods his head towards someone behind her.</p>\n<p>But Toni already knows who\u2019s there, can tell by the way Death shifts happily in her chest.</p>\n<p>And, sure enough, when she turns around with a hand already raised, James is there to catch it in his own.</p>\n<p>His hair\u2019s pulled back into a small bun and he\u2019s clean shaven, jawline sharp and stark. \u00a0His suit\u2019s an exquisitely fitted black on black ensemble that makes his eyes almost <em> glow</em>. \u00a0The only splash of color is the single asphodel blossom he has pinned to his lapel.</p>\n<p>When he lifts her hand and presses his lips to the back of her knuckles, for a split second Toni forgets how to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lepestok</em>,\u201d James drawls, voice curling warmly around the Russian endearment he\u2019s apparently christened her with.\u00a0 <em>Petal</em>. \u00a0Toni doesn\u2019t want to admit how the sound of it makes her melt just a bit. \u00a0\u201cDance with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni likes the way he makes it a question instead of a command.</p>\n<p>\u201cImpress me, Red October,\u201d Toni challenges him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d James drawls as he flicks his other wrist and produces another asphodel blossom from up his sleeve in an impressive sleight of hand trick. \u00a0Toni holds still as he reaches up and tucks it into her hair before he pulls her closer, metal hand settling low on her waist.</p>\n<p>And then they move.</p>\n<p>James twirls her around the floor, movements flowing and smooth. \u00a0He dances with the same sort of easy, dangerous competence with which he fights.</p>\n<p>Caught in his arms, matching him step for step, Toni feels a true smile creep its way up past the cool facade she normally wears at these things.</p>\n<p>The dance ends far too quickly, the music giving way to something faster, more vibrant. \u00a0Around them the laughter ramps up a notch as the dancers begin to get more lively.</p>\n<p>James doesn\u2019t let her go.</p>\n<p>Instead he pulls her even closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Toni,\u201d James says softly, evenly, like it\u2019s a fact instead of just another shallow compliment.</p>\n<p>Then he twirls her out and then back into his arms without giving her a chance to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaught my eye as soon as you walked in,\u201d James murmurs in her ear. \u00a0\u201cMost beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Out.</p>\n<p>In.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if I didn\u2019t know who you are,\u201d James whispers against her temple, \u201cI\u2019d still think you were a goddess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Out.</p>\n<p>In.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf all the things I\u2019ve seen in this new century,\u201d James rasps as he pulls her even closer, head dipping down until their foreheads are almost touching, \u201cI think you\u2019re what I like the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath shudders in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll these compliments,\u201d she manages to breathe, head tilted slightly to the side as she glances up at him from beneath her lashes, \u201cwhat are you after, Soldier?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a damn thing,\u201d James denies easily. \u00a0\u201cExcept giving you what you deserve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d \u00a0Toni can\u2019t help but ask as she loops her arm around his shoulders, short nails scratching idly at the nape of his neck. \u00a0\u201cWhat do you think I <em> deserve</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>James pulls her even closer and then dips her low, metal arm pressed firmly against her lower back and his body pressed closely to her own.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Worship</em>,\u201d James whispers, lips grazing the arc of her cheek.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath catches in her chest as she stares up at him.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>Oh</em>,\u2019 she thinks softly to herself as that soft and lovely thing inside of her blossoms just a bit more, \u2018<em>oh</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave with me?\u201d \u00a0James asks quietly, eyes intense but also so very soft.</p>\n<p>Staring up at him Toni knows there\u2019s only one answer she wants to give him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey and Vision see the two of them off with a wink and a nod respectively.</p>\n<p>Pepper catches her eye across the room and grins, naughty and sly, while Happy makes the classic \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2019 gesture towards James.</p>\n<p>Toni grins, bright and fond, at all of them, and lets James whirl her out of the door and towards the car that is, surprisingly enough, already waiting for them.</p>\n<p>Toni only looks back once.</p>\n<p>And there, hovering by the door of the hotel, hand clenched around a shattered champagne flute, is Rogers.</p>\n<p>She looks away, back up into James\u2019 bright eyes as he holds the driver\u2019s door of the car open for her after dead staring the valet away.</p>\n<p>Toni hikes her skirt up around her knees and slides inside.</p>\n<p>James moves around to the passenger side of the car and gets inside. \u00a0The door clicks shut behind him and then he moves his metal hand over until he can gently grab her hand and twine their fingers together on top of the gear shift.</p>\n<p>Toni breathes.</p>\n<p>Squeezes James\u2019 hand lightly in her own.</p>\n<p><em> Drives</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The ride back to the Compound is calm and easy.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk, comfortable with the silence between them interrupted only by the radio that\u2019s tuned into an oldies station.</p>\n<p>Then the song changes and Toni feels her heart skip a beat.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You are the promised kiss of springtime, that makes the lonely winter seem long</em>,\u201d Sinatra croons through the speakers.</p>\n<p>Toni blinks back the tears that come unbidden to her eyes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jarvis\u2019 favorite song, like an omen from on high from the only true father she\u2019s ever known.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You are the breathless hush of evening, </em> \u201d James sings beside her, voice husky as he raises the hand he\u2019s holding up to press another kiss against her knuckles, \u201c<em>that trembles on the brink of a lovely song</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>I love you</em>,\u2019 Toni sends the thought out into the ether. \u2018<em>I love you, I miss you, everything good about me came from you</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>She isn\u2019t sure if Jarvis can hear her where ever he is, but in a moment of optimistic fancy, she likes to think he can.</p>\n<p>She likes to think he always could.</p>\n<p>And that he knows just how much he still means to her, even all these years later.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>And someday</em>,\u201d Toni sings back, voice soft but warm, \u201c<em>I'll know that moment divine</em>, <em> when all the things you are, are mine</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni parks the car in front of the Compound but leaves it idling, confident that JARVIS will guide it back to the garage for her.</p>\n<p>She pops her seatbelt but before she can get her door open James is there, a hand extended in her direction.</p>\n<p>She reaches up and takes it.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s hand is tucked into the crook of James\u2019 arm as they amble down the path that stretches halfway across the Compound grounds.</p>\n<p>Night is thick and heavy around them, the air warm and thick with the scent of flowers as the wind blows lightly passed her garden.</p>\n<p>They come to the end of the path where paving stones give way to thick grass.</p>\n<p>Toni goes to keep moving but James tugs lightly on her hand and brings her to a stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Toni asks as she stares up at him.</p>\n<p>James just stares at her for a second as he lifts his metal hand up and glides the knuckles gently across the arc of her cheek.</p>\n<p>And then he bends down and sweeps her up off of her feet and into his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour shoes aren\u2019t exactly made for grass, petal,\u201d James says, \u201cpretty as they are on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d Toni snips back even as she relaxes back into his hold.</p>\n<p>They both know she can walk across grass in her heels. \u00a0Or that she could just as easily take them off.</p>\n<p>Neither of them mention the fact.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The garden feels like something out of a fairy tale.</p>\n<p>The fireflies are abundant and the pond is illuminated by the glow of the moon and the stars.</p>\n<p>James carries her across the bridge and underneath the pomegranate tree before he sits her down on the bench there. \u00a0She watches as he toes off his shoes and socks and reaches up to pull the tie from the collar of his shirt, undoing the top three buttons of his shirt as he goes.</p>\n<p>Then, his things set to the side on the bench, he kneels down at her feet and carefully, gently, reaches beneath the hem of her dress and removes her shoes.</p>\n<p>Her heels left beside his own shoes on the bench, Toni lets him tug her back up onto her feet.</p>\n<p>The height difference is even more pronounced between them as without her heels James towers over her even more than he normally does.</p>\n<p>He makes Toni feel almost \u2026 <em> delicate</em>.</p>\n<p>James walks backwards, never taking his eyes off of her, as he leads her back out onto the bridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cDance with me?\u201d James asks again once they\u2019re standing on the arch of the bridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u00a0Toni says again, voice hushed.</p>\n<p>There, bathed in moonlight and surrounded by fireflies, James pulls her close to his chest again.</p>\n<p>Together they sway to a beat that only they can hear.</p>\n<p>The moment feels fragile and eternal all at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni?\u201d James says her name softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d \u00a0Toni hums her question against the warmth of his chest, her lips brushing against the patch of skin he\u2019d bared when he\u2019d unbuttoned his shirt.</p>\n<p>James shudders, hand flexing lightly against her hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the story,\u201d he rasps after a long moment.</p>\n<p>Toni goes still in his arms.</p>\n<p>They stop swaying but James doesn\u2019t let her go.</p>\n<p>She finds that she doesn\u2019t want him to.</p>\n<p>Around them time itself seems to stand still.</p>\n<p>Toni closes her eyes, breathes deeply, and just like Icarus, lets herself take that fateful step out into the open air.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name was Kore,\u201d Toni whispers softly, \u201cand I brought the Spring.\u201d</p>\n<p>There, in the garden she built with her family, Toni tells James the truth, unvarnished and raw.</p>\n<p>Afterward, once it\u2019s been told, James just holds her, one hand pressed low against her spine and the other coming up to ghost lightly across the side of her throat.</p>\n<p>He catches her chin gently between warm fingers and tilts her head up towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not him,\u201d James says as his thumb smooths gently across the swell of her bottom lip. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not Hades and I\u2019m not Steve. I\u2019m not a god either. Just a weapon, hollowed out and dirty. \u00a0But I\u2019m loyal, Toni. I\u2019ve got loyalty in my <em> bones</em>. \u00a0And I know you\u2019ve got all the reason in the world not to trust me. \u00a0Not to trust anyone. But whatever I\u2019ve got left in me \u2026 it\u2019s yours, if you want it. \u00a0If you want me.\u201d</p>\n<p>James leans down, presses a soft, tender kiss against her forehead.</p>\n<p>The arc of her left cheek.</p>\n<p>Her right.</p>\n<p>The corner of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake a new myth me with, blossom,\u201d James whispers against her skin, the light hint of his already returning stubble rasping against her cheek. \u00a0\u201cBut only if you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath shudders in her chest.</p>\n<p>A tear slides slowly down her cheek.</p>\n<p>She turns her head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d she whispers for the third time that night.</p>\n<p>Toni closes her eyes and catches his mouth with her own.</p>\n<p>James shakes against her, the hand on her chin sliding down to join the other on her waist as he pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>It starts off soft and almost sweet, little more than a press of lips. \u00a0And then Toni brings a hand up to tug the elastic from his hair, fingers burying themselves in the thick locs.</p>\n<p>James groans, low and heavy in the back of his throat.</p>\n<p>The kiss deepens, goes hot and hungry.</p>\n<p>Toni unfurls for him like a blossom for the sun as flowers and vines burst into existence around their feet, flowering plants spreading out in a ripple with them at the epicenter as Life surges forward joyfully inside of her.</p>\n<p>James breaks the kiss, chest heaving and eyes blown wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d he rasps, \u201c<em>Toni</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he kisses her again.</p>\n<p>And Toni gives herself over to it, to him.</p>\n<p>The last of her fears, of her hesitations, are swept away.</p>\n<p>Because it doesn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019s being unfaithful to Steve, to Hades, as she\u2019d secretly feared being with anyone else would after her awakening.</p>\n<p>Instead it feels good, feels <em> right</em>.</p>\n<p>Because, Toni now knows without a shadow of a doubt, there is nothing left for her to betray. \u00a0Steve and the choices he\u2019d forced her to make have seen to that.</p>\n<p>Toni is, for the first time in longer than she can remember, really and truly free to choose.</p>\n<p>And she has.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>James</em>,\u2019 Toni thinks to herself on a sigh as she melts against him, \u2018<em>James</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/flowers/pcd6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flower Meanings Found Here</a>\n</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>A gentle tickling sensation against her face wakes Toni slowly, <em> softly</em>.</p>\n<p>Nose scrunched up just a bit she opens her eyes and for a split second before the world sharpens around her all Toni can see is <em> blue</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up, <em> moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James\u2019 voice is a low rumble from where he\u2019s leaning over her, propped up on one elbow. \u00a0His metal hand is busy brushing the asphodel blossom he\u2019s holding gently across her cheeks, the slope of her nose, the swell of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Toni asks softly as she lets her eyes slip closed again, face turned upwards towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you home and Rhodes and Vision might hunt me down and leave me for dead,\u201d James admits wryly, something like amusement and appreciation in his voice as he leans further down and ghosts his lips across her cheek. \u00a0\u201cBe a shame to die when I\u2019ve just got something to really live for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni melts just a bit in the face of his declaration, a response she\u2019s nowhere near beginning to get used to.</p>\n<p>James has a way about him, the ability to slip beneath her skin with ease.</p>\n<p>Toni knows it should be unsettling, the way he can get to her with just a few sweet words.</p>\n<p>But instead it just makes her feel <em> warm</em>. \u00a0Like sunlight streaming over her skin, like flowers are blossoming to life inside of her.</p>\n<p>She likes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey know where we are,\u201d Toni tells him lazily as she brings a hand up to tap at her earpiece meaningfully. \u00a0She\u2019s content to stay where she is, mind calm for once as she soaks up the warmth of having James beside her in the middle of the peace and tranquility of her garden. \u00a0\u201cJARVIS wouldn\u2019t let them worry about me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed not, Miss,\u201d JARVIS answers softly in her ear. \u00a0\u201cVision and Colonel Rhodes both wish you and Sergeant Barnes a good morning and would like you to know that breakfast will be ready shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Rhodey we\u2019ll be there in a hour or so,\u201d Toni tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Miss,\u201d JARVIS agree.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best kids, <em> moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James says softly, the pet name flowing off of his tongue easily.</p>\n<p><em> My flower</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni likes it.</p>\n<p>Likes the possessive lilt of it, the way he says it with a hint of what can only be described as <em> reverence</em>.</p>\n<p>Likes the way it makes her feel warm and <em> alive </em> deep down in that place inside of her that\u2019s been lonely and cold for so very long now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I do,\u201d Toni agrees, smile soft as it always is when she thinks of JARVIS and the others.</p>\n<p>They lay there for a few minutes, the flower making its way down her face to drift over the front of her dress where they both know the reactor hides.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d James finally says, \u201can hour huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Toni looks up at him his eyes bright and heavy lidded, his expression <em> hungry</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Toni hums in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot enough time then,\u201d James tells her as he tucks the flower behind her ear and then leans forward to press a hot, open mouthed kiss against the curve of her neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough time for what?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks even as she can\u2019t help the way her thighs clench together beneath the silk of her gown when he bites down just a bit.</p>\n<p>If it wasn\u2019t for her healing she knows she\u2019d be covered in love bites by now, the imprint of his teeth stark against the creamy line of her throat and her face rubbed red from the scratch of his stubble.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d spent hours kissing the night before, deep and hot and slow and sweet. \u00a0Mouths and hands wandering over each other with heat and passion even as they never took that final step towards what they both wanted.</p>\n<p>And oh did Toni want it, wants it still.</p>\n<p>But James had stopped her each time she reached for the fly of his suit pants, pulled her hands up and away to press kisses to her fingertips.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019d laid her back onto the grass beneath the pomegranate tree and made her <em> scream </em>with his teeth and tongue and fingers alone.</p>\n<p>And yet Toni still wants more, feels greedy for more of what he\u2019s already given her. \u00a0Hungry for his heat, his touch, for <em> him </em> in a way she can barely describe.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the things I wanna do to you,\u201d James whispers against the curve of her ear. \u00a0\u201cAll the things I wanna let you do to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni shudders just a bit as his hand slides down her side and tugs at the now wrinkled silk of her dress, pulling it slowly, teasingly, up her legs as he goes. \u00a0The metal of his hand is warm against her skin as he trails his fingers up her thighs, pausing only to tug almost playfully at the black lace of her stockings and her garter.</p>\n<p>And then, hand inches away from where she really wants him, he stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot enough time in the world,\u201d James says softly as he presses another kiss to her mouth, \u201cbut I\u2019m adaptable and I <em> always </em> finish the mission. \u00a0If you\u2019ll let me. So, <em>lepestok</em>, can I touch you? \u00a0Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Laying there on the grass beside him, his hand resting on her thigh as he asks for permission to touch her after a night spent wrapped around one another, Toni feels something inside of her <em> soar</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispers as she reaches up and tangles her fingers in his hair to pull him down into kiss that instantly goes hot and filthy as she lets her thighs fall open in welcome. \u00a0\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>James groans against her mouth as his fingers dip down between her thighs, panties long gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, <em> moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James whispers to her, voice rough and deliciously <em> dark</em>, \u201cI want to see you <em> bloom</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, head pressed back into the grass, thighs splayed open in abandon, and joy arcing through her like lightning, Toni <em> does</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>James walks her to the door of her bedroom once they make it back into the Compound.</p>\n<p>Her hair\u2019s disheveled but still up, her dress is a wrinkled disaster, and she\u2019s pretty sure her panties are in his pocket, but Toni resolutely <em> doesn\u2019t care</em>.</p>\n<p>Not with the way James is looking at her, eyes bright but still soft, as he backs her against her bedroom door and bends down to kiss her again, deep and hot and hungry.</p>\n<p>Like he can\u2019t get enough of her.</p>\n<p>Like he\u2019d stay right there, bracketing her in against the door, for the rest of forever if he could.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s glad that, in this as well, she\u2019s not alone.</p>\n<p>James breaks the kiss slowly, bit by bit instead of all at once. \u00a0And then he just stands there, bent over far enough that their foreheads can touch as they pant together.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna have to let you go eventually,\u201d James finally says, \u201cbut it\u2019s so damn <em> hard</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could fix that, Soldier,\u201d Toni can\u2019t help but say, the innuendo slipping out effortlessly as she leers at him, hand coming up to tug lightly at his waistband.</p>\n<p>James barks out a delighted laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh petal,\u201d James sighs as he leans down a bit more to rub his cheek against hers, like he\u2019s trying to rub his scent on her. \u00a0\u201cI know we could. But we\u2019re not gonna. Not yet. You wanna know why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Toni demands easily as she brings a hand up to tug lightly at the hair at the nape of his neck in that way she\u2019d discovered the night before that he most certainly likes.</p>\n<p>James shudders against her and then reaches up to tug her hand from his hair. \u00a0He brings it down until he can press another kiss against the palm and then he entwines their fingers and presses their clasped hands against the side of his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cCause I\u2019m gonna do this right,\u201d James tells her softly, intently. \u00a0\u201cGonna treat you like the lady, the <em> goddess</em>, you are. \u00a0And when you finally let me have you, I\u2019m gonna get so deep inside of you ain\u2019t nothing ever gonna be able to cut me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heat surges through Toni in a wave even as her mind <em> whirls</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure this is the game you wanna play?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks him just as softly, just as intently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u201d James agrees with a smirk. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure. Because it\u2019s gonna be so damn good for you. \u00a0I\u2019m gonna make sure of it. Gonna make it my mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you always finish the mission right?\u201d \u00a0Toni says as she presses closer to him, hand still pressed against his cheek as she goes up on her tiptoes to press her lips against his throat, teeth scraping against the vulnerable hollow there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Da</em>,\u201d James groans, head tilted back and his other hand pressed flat against the frame of her door, fingers tangled in the vines that have sprouted there.</p>\n<p>Toni swipes her tongue across the slightly salty expanse of his throat, bites at him one more time, and then she steps back out of his reach and through the bedroom door that she\u2019d opened while he was distracted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave it your way then,\u201d Toni teases him, high heels in one hand as the other smooths up the wooden frame of her door, soothing the flowers and vines down and away with a touch, as she arches her back just a bit, hips tilted out to the side.</p>\n<p>Showing herself off at the best angles the way she\u2019d learned through countless modeling session when she was younger.</p>\n<p>She takes a moment to stare at James while she displays for him, to take him in as he is, hair loose, jaw dark with stubble and eyes so very bright. \u00a0He\u2019s barechested, shirt and jacket in a heap alongside his shoes on the floor at his feet, the wide, muscled plane of his chest and the black and gold metal of his arm on full display.</p>\n<p>He looks primal, looks half feral and wild. \u00a0Dangerous and gorgeous by equal measures.</p>\n<p>And, Toni can\u2019t help but think with a sudden surge of a fierce sort of possessiveness, he\u2019s all <em> hers</em>.</p>\n<p>Because he <em> wants </em>to be.</p>\n<p>And then she lets the door swing shut between them.</p>\n<p>Pressed against the other side Toni watches with a young, girlish sort of glee that she can\u2019t remember ever feeling before, as JARVIS shows her the way James thunks his head against the wood of her door with a quiet curse.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d James breathes, his voice clear in her ear thanks to JARVIS, \u201cI\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then James grins, bright and beautiful and filled with an obvious sort of joy that the sight of it makes Toni\u2019s heart beat double time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorth it,\u201d James whispers as he presses a kiss to the fingers of his flesh hand and then presses those to her door, \u201cfucking worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni finds herself humming softly under her breath while she showers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is good to see you so cheerful, Miss,\u201d JARVIS says in her ear, voice warm. \u00a0\u201cHappiness suits you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni can\u2019t help but pause and laugh a little bit.</p>\n<p>At her feet blue lotus flowers blossom into being.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Toni asks softly. \u00a0\u201cI think it does too, J. I really think it does too.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>James is waiting for her when she makes her way to the kitchen in the private sector where she, Vision, and Rhodey all live. \u00a0The disconnect from their living spaces and the Rogues had been a deliberate sort of move that\u2019s helped to keep much of the peace over the past few months.</p>\n<p>Rhodey and Vision are both at the stove and James is sprawled in a set at the bar, back to the wall and settled as far into the shadows as he can be with all of the morning light pouring into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>He stands when she walks into the kitchen, eyes riveted onto her as she moves first to Rhodey and then to Vision, giving them both a kiss to the cheek and accepting the cup of coffee that Rhodey automatically passes her.</p>\n<p>She can feel his eyes like a touch as she moves across the kitchen until she\u2019s standing directly in front of him.</p>\n<p>James doesn\u2019t say anything, just reaches up and places yet another asphodel into her hair before he bends down and presses a soft, lingering kiss against her mouth.</p>\n<p>Toni just smiles and kisses him back.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Rhodey drawls as he stares at Toni who\u2019s settled beside James at the bar. \u00a0She\u2019s sitting in a shaft of sunlight with a tablet on the counter in front of her as she picks happily at the fruit salad Vision had made for her. \u00a0Her other hand is being held by James who\u2019s already plowed through his food and is, instead, playing gently with her fingers while he sits sprawled in the shadow patch Toni had called on the potted plants above him to make deeper. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s cute or disturbing. Winter Soldier being all sweet and cuddly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m adorable,\u201d James cuts back calmly as he presses another kiss to Toni\u2019s fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you\u2019re something alright,\u201d Rhodey snips back but Toni can hear the teasing hiding behind the blandness of his voice.</p>\n<p>The grin James flashes at Rhodey is both sharp and playful all at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Children</em>,\u201d Vision sighs fondly from across the bar.</p>\n<p>Toni laughs, bright and happy.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>But the joy, the peace, doesn\u2019t last.</p>\n<p>Because of course it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>They\u2019re walking through the common area, intent on heading out to the garden again, when it happens.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s aware of the Rogues littered across the various couches and chairs in the room but she doesn\u2019t pay them any mind.</p>\n<p>Not even Rogers who surges to his feet, face pale and stricken, when they walk into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Whore</em>,\u201d Maximoff\u2019s hiss stops James in his tracks.</p>\n<p>And Toni, whose hand is tucked in the crook of his arm as the other plays with yet another asphodel blossom that he\u2019s given her, stops with him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>,\u201d James\u2019 voice is dark and dangerous, \u201cdid you just say, little witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Toni looks up at him his face is as unforgiving as stone.</p>\n<p>He looks every inch the Winter Soldier from legend then. \u00a0The ghost story and scourge by equal measures.</p>\n<p>\u201cI called her a whore,\u201d Maximoff cuts back recklessly, accent thick and heavy. \u00a0\u201cSteve saw her for the monster she is and now that she can\u2019t have him she\u2019s throwing herself at his best friend instead. \u00a0She is a <em> faithless whore</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was your one chance,\u201d James says softly as he takes a step forward, hand coming up to gently move Toni\u2019s hand from the crook of his arm. \u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m giving it to you because Stevie cares about you for some fucking reason. But open your HYDRA trash mouth again and I\u2019ll rip your tongue out with my bare hands. \u00a0And believe me, <em> little girl</em>, I\u2019ve done it before. \u00a0Only difference is that this time? \u00a0I\u2019ll actually enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>In Toni\u2019s chest Death twists joyfully, thrumming across her every nerve ending.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck,\u201d Rogers steps forward then, \u201cthat\u2019s enough. \u00a0Wanda shouldn\u2019t have said that but you shouldn\u2019t threaten her like that either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Stevie,\u201d James shakes his head sharply. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. None of it is. And I don\u2019t know what the fuck happened to the Steve I knew after I fell but I do know that whatever came out of the ice isn\u2019t him. \u00a0Cause the guy I knew? The one I followed right off the side of a train in the alps? You ain\u2019t him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni hears the grief in James\u2019 voice then and, unable to help herself, she takes a step forward and brings a hand up to smooth soothingly up the line his spine.</p>\n<p>To Toni\u2019s surprise he seems to settle just a bit beneath her touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Buck,\u201d Rogers insists. \u00a0\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m still me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not,\u201d James dismisses his protests. \u00a0\u201cThe Steve I knew was a stubborn little punk but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d James gestures towards Rogers, \u201c<em>this</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you changed too,\u201d Rogers cuts back. \u00a0\u201cBecause the Bucky I knew would\u2019ve <em> never </em>tried to steal my girl from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>In that moment Toni goes abruptly and dangerously still.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour girl?\u201d Toni asks quietly as she takes a step up to stand by James\u2019 side. \u00a0\u201c<em>Your girl?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToni ...\u201d Rogers starts to say, face twisted in what Toni\u2019s almost certain is grief.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter though.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s far past the point where she\u2019s concerned about what Rogers is or is not feeling at any given moment.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d seen to that himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see <em> Sharon Carter </em> around here anywhere,\u201d Toni cuts him off sharply. \u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure who, exactly, you\u2019re talking about. \u00a0But considering that James is <em> mine </em>I don\u2019t see him wanting or needing anyone or anything of yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside her James shudders just a bit and the hand that comes down to rest on the small of her back flexes and then tangles itself in the silk of her blouse like he can\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you\u2019re upset with me,\u201d Rogers says softly, pleadingly. \u00a0\u201cI know I \u2026 I know I\u2019ve done some things that hurt you, but that doesn\u2019t change who we are to each other, Toni.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <em> nothing </em>to each other,\u201d Toni hisses as she hands the asphodel she\u2019s holding to James who takes it from her automatically and then takes another step forward. \u00a0\u201cYou made sure of that right from the beginning. No matter how hard I tried. You don\u2019t get to try and mend those bridges now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Rogers starts but again Toni cuts him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me by my name then,\u201d Toni demands sharply. \u00a0\u201cYou want to lay claim to me after all this time then call me by my name. \u00a0My true name, not the one I took in this life. Call me by the name you <em> know </em> was given to me. \u00a0By the name you know I made mine in <em> truth</em>. \u00a0The name of the one you called <em> wife</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more than one sharp inhale from around the room but Toni pays them no mind, attention focused, razor sharp and just as deadly, on Rogers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Rogers stumbles over his words.</p>\n<p>But Toni has no mercy left in her, not for him, not for any of them.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Say it</em>,\u201d Toni hisses at him, voice deep and dark and filled with something <em> more </em> as her composure slips in the face of his useless guilt. \u00a0Inside her chest Death writhes, rearing its head inside of her, vicious and unforgiving in the face of its former avatar. \u00a0\u201cFor once in this life. <em> Say my name</em>. \u00a0Or are you too afraid someone will finally realize what you\u2019ve done? \u00a0Name me, oh <em> Lord of Riches</em>. \u00a0If you dare.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, short and practically crackling with tension, but Rogers holds his tongue now as he has since this entire thing began.</p>\n<p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Toni sneers as she goes to turn, to move back toward James\u2019 side. \u00a0Right where she <em> belongs </em> now if she has anything to say about it.</p>\n<p>She sees Rogers step forward, sees him reach for her out of the corner of her eye.</p>\n<p>Sees the way rage flashes, cold and dark, across James\u2019 face as he steps forward to meet him.</p>\n<p>But Toni is, in this moment, faster than both of them, spurred on by her own rage and the way Death claws at her insides viciously.</p>\n<p>The grey-blue cabbage roses that are twined around her wrist surge to life, stems and petals exploding outwards in a burst.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you once before,\u201d Toni hisses as she nudges Rogers\u2019 chin with the tip of the flower and vine drill that\u2019s formed around her arm. \u00a0\u201c<em>Don\u2019t touch me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of scarlet from the side of the room then but Toni doesn\u2019t move an inch.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>James is on guard at her back in a flash, a knife cutting through the air to slam into the floor at Romanov\u2019s feet even as another appears as if by magic in his hand.</p>\n<p>And he isn\u2019t alone in his defense of her either. \u00a0The plants around the room have surged to life as more burst from the floors and the walls. \u00a0Life blossoming from every corner of the room as flowers and vines surge forward to wrap around the Rogues.</p>\n<p>Barton bites out curses as he struggles against the spiny burdock that\u2019s taken him over.</p>\n<p>Romanov stands frozen as pink larkspur congregate around her legs and creep up to wrap around her wrists.</p>\n<p>Wilson curses and hops up to stand on top of the couch, but can\u2019t escape the candytufts that drag at his legs.</p>\n<p>Lang looks terrified but, to his credit, doesn\u2019t try to fight the horseshoe geraniums that lash him down to the chair he\u2019d been sitting on.</p>\n<p>Maximoff thrashes where she\u2019s pinned to the wall, hyssop and heather growing over her like a mound, the blossoms eating the sick red of her powers from the air around her.</p>\n<p>And still Rogers stands, Toni\u2019s drill pointed at his chin, arms and shoulders weighted down with swathes of striped carnations and petunias, legs tangled in great bursts of anemone blossoms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I have your <em> attention</em>,\u201d Toni drawls as James wraps an arm around her waist and presses himself against her back. \u00a0\u201cI want you to answer one question for me. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rogers\u2019 clenches his eyes closed, chest shuddering as he inhales, and when he opens his eyes again Toni can see the slightest hint of tears.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>His tears can\u2019t move her, not now. \u00a0Not after everything that\u2019s passed between and around the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it felt like a cage,\u201d Rogers finally says. \u00a0\u201cHaving all that knowledge, those memories, poured into my head. \u00a0All that weight and responsibility. I didn\u2019t \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to be a <em> god</em>. \u00a0I didn\u2019t want to have so much plotted out for me like I didn\u2019t have a choice. \u00a0Not after I\u2019d already lost so much. So I just \u2026 <em> didn\u2019t</em>. \u00a0Instead I pushed it all away. \u00a0And when that worked I just \u2026 kept pushing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Kept pushing her away. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say it but the words linger in the room between them regardless.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Coward</em>,\u201d Toni finally whispers bitingly. \u00a0Not even the way Rogers flinches brings her any measure of joy. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a coward with a piss poor excuse for what you\u2019ve done and you are <em> not </em>the god I once loved.\u201d</p>\n<p>She drops the drill, lets the roses settle back around her wrist as she leans back against James. \u00a0Soaks in his warmth and his strength and the <em> loyalty </em>he has promised her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis really is your one warning,\u201d Toni tells Rogers and the others, announces it to the room at large. \u00a0\u201cAttack me or mine again and I will bury you so far deep beneath the ground that no one will <em> ever </em>find you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersephone,\u201d Rogers finally whispers. \u00a0\u201c<em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni doesn\u2019t even pause. \u00a0Instead she turns in James\u2019 arms, very deliberately gives them all her back, and reaches up to brush away the four leaf clovers and asphodel flowers that have grown like a protective cape around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Toni says to him softly, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing left for me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>James says nothing for a long moment, jaw clenched and eyes fever bright, but then he leans down, presses a kiss to her forehead, and uses the arm still around her waist to guide her out of the common room.</p>\n<p>Neither of them look back.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d \u00a0James asks her softly once they\u2019re in the garden.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Toni tells him with a surprising amount of honesty. \u00a0\u201cOr at least I think I will be now. I\u2019m just \u2026 <em> disappointed</em>. \u00a0I thought he\u2019d have a better reason somehow. \u00a0Something less \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d \u00a0James supplies the word for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toni sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned over the years, <em>lepestok</em>,\u201d James says quietly as he pulls her close to his chest, a hand low on her back and the other ghosting gently over her up-swept hair, \u201cis that sometimes people are just like that. \u00a0Don\u2019t think gods are all that different. Much as I love the punk from my memories, as good a man as I know he can be, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s all that different either.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that, Toni can\u2019t help but think, might be what hurts the most.</p>\n<p>Because Rogers, <em> Hades</em>, was supposed to be different.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d James whispers to her then. \u00a0\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Toni. You have all of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s eyes slip closed, she turns her face into the large, warm palm that comes up to cup her face.</p>\n<p>She <em> breathes</em>.</p>\n<p>And then she lets the last lingering threads of confusion and hurt that have been hiding within her shatter and fall away.</p>\n<p>She owes Rogers or the Rogues nothing.</p>\n<p>Not her pain, not her sadness, not her consideration.</p>\n<p><em> Nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>She is Toni Stark. \u00a0Is the Iron Queen.</p>\n<p>Is a goddess, is Persephone and Kore and all that both imply.</p>\n<p>She has her family, has <em> James</em>, and that is more than enough.</p>\n<p>Is more than she\u2019d <em> ever </em>thought she\u2019d have.</p>\n<p>More than she\u2019d ever thought she\u2019d deserve in this life.</p>\n<p>And Toni intends to keep every single one of them.</p>\n<p><em> Forever</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The tabloids read:</p>\n<p>\n<em> A Winter Romance: Toni Stark and James Barnes, Hot New Superhero Couple? </em>\n</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a picture of the two of them at the gala that was obviously snapped in that final moment before they left the dance floor.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s bent back over James\u2019 arm and it\u2019s easy to see from the photo alone that both of them have eyes only for each other.</p>\n<p>JARVIS cuts a copy of it for Toni and adds it to the rotating digital picture frame in the workshop.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Romanov tries to talk to her, voice soft and expression earnest, a day or so later when Toni is heading out of the Compound.</p>\n<p>Toni says nothing, just keeps walking and then slides into the driver\u2019s seat of the car JARVIS had pulled around for her.</p>\n<p>When she looks in the mirror Romanov is staring after her, face blank, from behind the wall of belladonna that had shot up between them.</p>\n<p>Toni has not, truly, been hiding what she is before now. \u00a0Anyone in the know would be aware of the significance behind the flowers in her hair or on her wrists, with the nature themes that have slowly worked their way into her classic shades of black and gold and crimson.</p>\n<p>Or at least anyone not being willfully blind by this point.</p>\n<p>Even James, Rhodey, and Vision have shouted their allegiance more than once with floral themes and flowers of their own.</p>\n<p>So she hasn\u2019t really been hiding anything.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s just done being her version of subtle where the Rogues are concerned.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I sleep with you again?\u201d James asks softly, a hand at her waist and lips pressed against her ear. \u00a0\u201cWanna wake up with you beside me. Be the first thing I see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toni whispers as she pulls him into her bedroom, the door clicking closed behind him.</p>\n<p>Because she wants that too.</p>\n<p>Wants it more than she\u2019d thought possible.</p>\n<p>Wants so much of what he\u2019s already given her and so much of what she can feel hanging there between them, like a bud about to blossom.</p>\n<p>Toni falls asleep with James at her side, an asphodel on her pillow, and peace in her heart.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The grass is cool and soft beneath the pomegranate tree, the branches above them heavy with fruit, each one thick and ripe.</p>\n<p>Skirt pushed up around her waist, panties gone and stocking clad thighs splayed wide, Toni stares up at the patches of sunlight filtering down through the leaves with a mind gone hazy with want.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d James rasps as he moves back up her body, voice rough and stubble damp. \u00a0\u201cTaste like sunshine, petal. Like the sweetest honey I\u2019ve ever had. Could eat you for days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni tastes herself on his tongue, honey sweet just like he\u2019d said, when he kisses her.</p>\n<p>And then she gasps against his mouth, ragged and broken, when his fingers dip deep inside of her, crooked just right to make her senses light up with pleasure.</p>\n<p>Around them pomegranates fall to the ground, cushioned by the clovers and red poppies that have sprouted, as the tree shudders and abruptly bears new fruit.</p>\n<p>James pulls back from her, eyes blown wide and bright, and reaches over to grab a thick, crimson skinned pomegranate from the ground. \u00a0It contrasts beautifully against the black and gold of his arm, the most unsubtle sort of symbolism.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow you don\u2019t eat em anymore,\u201d he tells her, breathing just a bit ragged. \u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m gonna lick up every fucking drop and seed.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hand tightens and the pomegranate bursts, seed and juice sluicing down over his fingers to land in warm little splatters against her stomach and thighs.</p>\n<p>All Toni can do is clench her fingers in the flowers that have sprouted around her and keen, breathy and high in the back of her throat, as he does just that.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni isn\u2019t sure how but Lang manages to look even more terrified everytime she sees him.</p>\n<p>It might have something to do with the smug little giggles of the geraniums that sway outside of his window.</p>\n<p>Toni, honestly, couldn\u2019t care less.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey finds her one morning while James is doing laps around the pond, content to do his workout in the serenity of her garden away from the others and, most importantly of all, away from Rogers.</p>\n<p>Toni watches on with a smile she hasn\u2019t been able to fully erase in <em> days </em> as Rhodey\u2019s arms, familiar and solid and always loved, wrap around her waist as he tugs her against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look happy, baby girl,\u201d Rhodey says as he presses a kiss against her temple. \u00a0\u201cBeen a long time since I\u2019ve seen you smile like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2026 I am happy,\u201d Toni confesses as she cuddles closer to Rhodey\u2019s chest. \u00a0\u201cI, Rhodey, I\u2019m so <em> happy </em>it \u2026 it scares me a bit.\u201d Tears well up in the corners of her eyes but she swallows them back down. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2026 I never thought I could have this. After what happened with \u2026 I didn\u2019t think this would be possible for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Rhodey tells her softly as he smooths a hand down the line of her spine and rocks her a bit back and forth. \u00a0\u201cMe and Vision and JARVIS. Pepper and Happy too. We all did. You want to know why?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni nods her head against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you were made to be loved, Tones,\u201d Rhodey tells her softly as he pulls back just enough to where they can look each other in the eyes. \u00a0\u201cYou. Toni Stark. Persephone. Kore. All the parts of you. You got so much light inside of you Toni and I knew that, one day, you\u2019d find the right person to give it to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t,\u201d Toni swallows, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a problem with it being James?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now,\u201d Rhodey says firmly, \u201cit ain\u2019t my place to tell you who to be with. \u00a0Never has been, never will be. So no, I ain\u2019t got a problem with Barnes. And as long as he\u2019s good to you, good <em> for </em>you, as long as he keeps putting that smile on your face? \u00a0I never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Rhodey,\u201d Toni whispers softly as she presses close to him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, Toni,\u201d Rhodey says as he folds his arms around her. \u00a0\u201cBecause no matter what it\u2019s you and me, till the day we die.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni wakes with James at her side, an asphodel on her pillow, and joy in her heart.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d Maximoff rasps.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s haggard looking, eyes red rimmed and undercut by dark circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d she repeats, voice desperate and almost small.</p>\n<p>Toni stares at the loops of hyssop and heather that are still curled around Maximoff\u2019s wrists like bracelets and watches as they eat the tiny flickers of scarlet from the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni tells her easily enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d Maximoff snarls. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t take my powers from me. You don\u2019t have the right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take anything from you,\u201d Toni cuts back. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m just making sure you learn something far overdue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d \u00a0Maximoff bites out. \u201cWhat could you <em> possibly </em>teach me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cControl.\u201d \u00a0Toni says as she turns on her heel and strides away. \u00a0\u201cLearn some or get used to your new accessories.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni refuses to harbor a loose canon, a threat, like Maximoff under her roof anymore without doing something about it.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni still doesn\u2019t eat pomegranates.</p>\n<p>But what she does do is kiss the taste of them from James\u2019 mouth after she feeds the seeds to him by the hand fulls.</p>\n<p>He eats every single one with a smile.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Vision asks her softly one afternoon as he floats his way around the workshop.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence because Toni is struck more than a bit dumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not have to answer,\u201d Vision tells her softly as he comes back to her side, a hand coming up to cup her cheek in his wide palm. \u00a0\u201cI already know the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he smiles at her, soft and loving.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove,\u201d Vision whispers to her, \u201cis an excellent look for you, Toni. \u00a0I wish you only love like this, now and in the future. Until the end of days.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Head pillowed on James\u2019 chest, her hand smoothing idly up and down the length of his metal arm as he plays idly with one of her escaped curls, Toni can\u2019t help but think about what Vision had said to her.</p>\n<p><em> Love</em>.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>Oh</em>,\u2019 Toni thinks to herself with no small amount of wonder and joy as James flips her over onto her back, hands sliding up beneath the hem of the overly large henley she\u2019d stolen from him to tug her panties down.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>Of course,</em>\u2019 Toni\u2019s mind whispers as she buries her hands in his hair, \u2018<em>of course that\u2019s what this is</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>As soon as the realization of what she feels for James crystalizes inside of her the thought seems to haunt Toni\u2019s every waking and sleeping moment.</p>\n<p><em> Love</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni finds herself thinking about it constantly, the words hanging on the tip of her tongue everytime James laughs. \u00a0Swirling in her head every time he smiles at her. Battering against her teeth, desperate to be passed from her mouth to his, every time they kiss.</p>\n<p>It should scare her, the idea of loving someone else. \u00a0Of being open and vulnerable again after being so deeply and thoroughly rejected by Rogers.</p>\n<p>Toni knows it should terrify her deep down inside, in that place she\u2019s always tucked her hurts and her betrayals until she could forge them into armor and nightmares by equal measures.</p>\n<p>And <em> yet </em>\u2026</p>\n<p>That last confrontation with Rogers and the Rogues as a whole had done more than allow the final lingering threads of confusion and hurt that had been hiding within her to shatter and fall away.</p>\n<p>James\u2019 ready defense of her had done more than soothe the hurt of that moment.</p>\n<p>Because Toni really doesn\u2019t owe Rogers or the Rogues anything.</p>\n<p>Not her pain, not her sadness, not her consideration.</p>\n<p>Not her hesitation or her fear.</p>\n<p><em> Nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>Rogers, Hades, doesn\u2019t get to have this sort of control over her.</p>\n<p>Doesn't get to make her afraid, doesn\u2019t get to make her hesitate now when she <em> finally </em>has the one thing she never thought she\u2019d find after he\u2019d shoved her away finally within her reach.</p>\n<p>So, <em> love</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni knows it should scare her.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p><em> James </em>doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>She <em> loves </em>him.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s as far from fear as anything she\u2019s ever felt.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Determination and joy crystalizing inside of her Toni turns her attention towards what, exactly, she should do about her new realization.</p>\n<p>Because she\u2019d made the mistake once of not telling someone who meant the world to her how she felt about them.</p>\n<p>Jarvis had died before she\u2019d gathered the courage to say those words to him face to face. \u00a0Had been ripped from her before everything that had always been implied between the two of them could finally be spoken.</p>\n<p>Before she could ever tell him that he, and not Howard, was the father of her heart and soul.</p>\n<p>That every good and kind thing inside of her had come from him.</p>\n<p>Toni had lost that chance and had later on vowed not to lose that chance with anyone else she loved ever again.</p>\n<p>So just like with Rhodey and JARVIS, with the bots and Vision and all of the rest of their small family, James deserves nothing less than to hear the truth of how she feels straight from her.</p>\n<p>Plus, because she\u2019s never been one to go small, Toni\u2019s determined to make sure James gets nothing but the best.</p>\n<p>Of this new life he\u2019s found himself in.</p>\n<p>Of this new revelation Toni\u2019s experienced, this new truth that\u2019s blossomed to life inside of her.</p>\n<p>Of <em> her</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with James,\u201d Toni blurts out as she bursts through the door.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a yelp, the sound of plastic bottles falling and bouncing against tile, and then a tirade of vicious cursing.</p>\n<p>Toni, impatient and just a bit giddy, taps her foot against the tile and waits.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God-fucking-damnit Tones</em>,\u201d Rhodey scowls at her as he slides the glass door of the shower partially open and sticks his head out, short cropped hair thick with suds. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019ve I told you about scaring the shit out of me in the shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to do it cause if you slip and fall and die in the shower your naked ass is gonna haunt me for the rest of existence,\u201d Toni recites by rote and then waves it away as she always does. \u00a0\u201cYour ass is the least of my worries right now coffee-crunch. I have <em> news</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou being in love with the resident freeze-n-play murder doll isn\u2019t news, sweetheart,\u201d Rhodey grumbles as he ducks back into the shower to rinse off.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Rhodey</em>,\u201d Toni whines just a bit as she slinks over to the shower so she can use the built in step to boost herself up to sit on top of the stone counter top, \u201cI\u2019m having a <em> crisis</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Toni</em>,\u201d Rhodey whines back as the water shuts off and he thrusts a arm out of the shower demandingly, \u201cyou <em> are </em>a crisis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Toni admits easily enough as she reaches over and hands him two of the thick fluffy white towels on that are laying on the counter beside her.</p>\n<p>Rhodey pulls open the shower door then, one towel wrapped around his waist and the other held up in his hands as he scrubs water from his face and hair.</p>\n<p>Toni watches him, fondness swirling in her chest. \u00a0She can\u2019t resist the urge to tease him a bit though as he drapes his towel over his shoulders and moves towards the sink beside her.</p>\n<p>It takes only a moment's thought to have the ferns in the corner of the room swaying to the side so that orchids can creep up out of the soil, flowers blooming into being as they go.</p>\n<p>Rhodey cuts her a baleful look that does little to hide his amusement when the flower crown settles on his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re having too much fun playing at being a green thumb,\u201d Rhodey warns her as he reaches up to absently straighten the crown before he reaches for a bottle of the luxuriously thick lotion Pepper buys him for Christmas every year. \u00a0\u201cIf it didn\u2019t scare the shit out of the rest of the assholes who live here I might tell you to dial it back a bit. Especially since I\u2019m pretty sure the plants you put in my room are flirting with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both know he\u2019s lying, Rhodey would never ask her to deny something that\u2019s become such an important part of who she is since all of this started.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re cute for someone without roots.\u201d Toni tells him easily enough because it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>The coral honeysuckle, traveler\u2019s joy, and white heather she\u2019d coaxed to life in Rhodey\u2019s room adores him just as she does.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus,\u201d Toni points out, \u201cdon\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t sing to them when you\u2019re alone. \u00a0That totally isn\u2019t helping their little crush on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a man of many talents,\u201d Rhodey sniffs. \u00a0\u201cAnd they\u2019re good listeners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation,\u201d Toni says, \u201cthe holly hedges around the garden think James is <em> to die for</em>. \u00a0And I\u2019m pretty sure the bonsai in Vision\u2019s room is one more dedicated pruning session away from proposing marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better make sure I\u2019m there when you tell Vision that,\u201d Rhodey demands. \u00a0\u201cThe look on his face is gonna be priceless. And JARVIS better record it when Vision tries to let them down easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni grins, bright and happy, at the mental image of Vision having the \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 speech with the miniature sakura tree in his room.</p>\n<p>Silence falls as comfortable and easy as always between the two of them. \u00a0Toni letting her feet swing idly, high heels barely clinging to her toes, as she watches Rhodey\u2019s long familiar grooming routine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a little kid,\u201d Rhodey finally says fondly as he turns towards her, smiling slightly when she sticks her tongue out at him.</p>\n<p>But, as always, he looks at her grabby hands gesture and shifts until he\u2019s right in front of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou done ignoring my crisis?\u201d Toni asks as she reaches up and tugs at the towel around his neck. \u00a0\u201cGood. Now help me Obi-Wan-Ke-Rhodey, you\u2019re my only hope.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Rhodey signs as he leans down and presses his forehead against hers, \u201cbaby girl you know you don\u2019t need my help. \u00a0Not with this. Not with Barnes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni goes quiet, serious and solemn.</p>\n<p>Because she might not be afraid of loving James but there is a small, sick voice in the back of her mind, one that predates Rogers\u2019 betrayal, one that sounds like <em> Howard </em>just as it always does, that hisses a thousand, vicious \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 at her.</p>\n<p>Toni does her best to push it away, uses her newfound determination and her long held iron will, to shove it back.</p>\n<p>Because it doesn\u2019t matter if James might not feel the exact same way about her yet despite how sweetly, how lovingly he treats her. \u00a0Despite the way he\u2019s already pledged himself to her over and over again.</p>\n<p>Even if Toni still has time to go before she can earn more than James\u2019 precious and all-encompassing loyalty and warmth, before she can earn the entirety of his <em> heart</em>, she\u2019s still going to press forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks him quietly even as she draws strength from him like she always does.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rhodey tells her softly, lovingly. \u00a0\u201cThat man adores you, Toni. He looks at you like you\u2019re his whole world, just like you deserve. \u00a0Has for a long time now. The rest of us wouldn\u2019t like him so much if he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d \u00a0Toni barely breathes the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d Rhodey shifts, presses his lips against her forehead, and then pull back.</p>\n<p>Toni opens her eyes slowly as she stares up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe loves you, Toni,\u201d Rhodey tells her softly. \u00a0\u201cNow go tell him how you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Toni <em> smiles</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Despite Rhodey\u2019s reassurances Toni finds herself indecisive as to what to do. \u00a0She spends all of ten minutes tossing ideas back and forth inside of her head, fingers tapping out familiar patterns against the reactor hidden beneath her clothes. \u00a0The reactor she hasn\u2019t tried to remove because some reminders shouldn\u2019t be so easily dismissed, so quickly wiped away.</p>\n<p>And then James goes striding past the door of the private lounge she\u2019s been lurking in and Toni reacts on some kind of knee jerk reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Soldier,\u201d Toni calls as she steps out of her heels and bends down to pick both of them up. \u00a0Behind her a ivy vine taps at the window until JARVIS obligingly slides it open.</p>\n<p>She feels her stomach flutter just a bit when James\u2019 attention immediately zeroes in on her as he turns and steps into the door of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lepestok</em>,\u201d James says with a small but <em> loving </em>smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCatch,\u201d Toni says as she tosses one of her shoes in his direction.</p>\n<p>James catches it automatically of course even if he does look more than a bit surprised at having one of her black and gold stilettos tossed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you up to, petal?\u201d James asks, one part obviously amused and one part confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow now,\u201d Toni says, lips curling in a sly smile as she takes a step back and then another, inching closer to the open window. \u00a0\u201cThat would be <em> telling</em>. \u00a0So why don\u2019t you find out for yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou trying to play another game with me, blossom?\u201d \u00a0James asks, eyes already bright and voice gone deep as he steps further into the room. \u00a0Her shoes still in his hand and Toni can\u2019t help the way she stares for just a moment at the way his fingers stroke softly over the velvet and metal. \u00a0\u201cBecause you know how much I like to play with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She knows exactly what those hands are capable of in more areas than one.</p>\n<p>Just the thought is enough to make her clench her thighs together, something that James obviously picks up on in the deep, shuddering breath he takes is any indication.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then,\u201d Toni practically purrs as she tosses her other shoe to him, her own eyes heavy lidded and breathing coming just a bit quicker as the ivy slithers in through the window and wraps gently around her waist, \u201cguess you\u2019ll have to catch me to find out then. \u00a0Won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She has enough time to see the way James drops her shoes and takes a lunging step forward before the ivy pulls her out of the second story window.</p>\n<p>Standing barefoot on the grass outside the Compound Toni looks up and sees James leaning out the window, hair loose around his shoulder as he stares down at her.</p>\n<p>Feeling more than a bit impish she reaches up to pop the first button on her blouse even as the other comes up to her face to blow him a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em> moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James says loud enough for Toni to hear him down on the ground, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s eyes widen just a bit when he steps up onto the window ledge and steps out into the open air as easily as breathing.</p>\n<p>He lands on the grass as light as a cat, balanced on his toes and face curled in a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to give you a head start, blossom, or you just wanna give up now?\u201d \u00a0James asks as he takes a single, prowling step forwards.</p>\n<p>Not one to be outdone Toni narrows her eyes and steps forward too, moves into his space until their chests are pressed together.</p>\n<p>She brings a hand up to tangle in his hair and tugs him down until his mouth is hovering just over hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to catch me, Soldier,\u201d Toni whispers against his mouth before she bites down on his lower lip and tugs just a bit. \u00a0His harsh groan is one of the best things she\u2019s heard in an age. \u201cIf you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then she ducks down and out of his arms, a swirl of red and pink hyacinth blossoms bursting into existence between them and obscuring her from view.</p>\n<p>By the time the small colorful explosion clears Toni is wrapped back in the ivy vines and already back up inside the second floor window.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t help but grin as the wind carries James\u2019 bark of delighted laughter back up to her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I be of assistance, Miss?\u201d \u00a0JARVIS asks softly in her ear. \u201cI assume this game of chase is to be a part of the production you wish to put together for Sergeant Barnes so that you may announce your feelings?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJARVIS,\u201d Toni laughs, \u201cyou know me so well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, Miss,\u201d JARVIS agrees. \u00a0\u201cAnd I would have it no other way. \u00a0But as Sergeant Barnes is currently on the way I would suggest you move.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Toni does.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>With JARVIS\u2019 help Toni manages to lead James on a bit of a merry chase around and through the private wings of the Compound.</p>\n<p>Vision smiles at her fondly when she tumbles in through his window in a flurry of vines and petals with James hot on her heels.</p>\n<p>Rhodey laughs, loud and fond, when Toni ducks behind him only for James to practically skid into the room behind her. \u00a0He lets her twist him this way and that and then voluntarily blocks the window Toni slips out of for a solid six seconds before James goes out the one beside him instead.</p>\n<p>Lang is less happy when he ends up between James and a door Toni\u2019s just slipped through.</p>\n<p>His terrified yelp makes the geraniums outside his window and the Compound at large giggle just a bit meanly.</p>\n<p>Joy pounding in her heart and flowers blossoming to life beneath every step she takes, Toni resolutely doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The sun\u2019s setting by the time Toni makes her way into the garden, slipping in through the holly hedges that promise to actually make James work to get in this time.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re lying their ripe little berries off but Toni lets it pass with only a small grin.</p>\n<p>Even the short amount of time it\u2019ll take James to sweet talk them will be enough for what Toni has in mind.</p>\n<p>As she makes her way beneath the protective branches of the pomegranate tree Toni reaches up and plucks the first of many pins from her hair.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou finally done running from me now, <em> moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James calls out as he steps across the bridge and makes his way towards the pomegranate tree a few minutes later. \u00a0\u201cNot that chasin you isn\u2019t enough to get me h-\u201d</p>\n<p>James\u2019 goes quiet, words cut over with a sharp inhale.</p>\n<p>Toni, clothes abandoned on the bench and hair left to fall in a thick tumble of curls down past her waist, just tilts her head up proudly and stares at him.</p>\n<p>James, eyes blown wide, steps forward almost without seeming to realize it, boots sinking down into the thick carpet of clover.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Toni</em>?\u201d \u00a0His whisper is ragged, <em> wanting</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni steps forward too, hair sliding against her naked skin, arc reactor shining brightly, openly, in the dimming light beneath the tree as she crosses the space between them.</p>\n<p>She stops an arm\u2019s length away, easily within reach of him.</p>\n<p>James keeps his hands at his side, fingers flexing rapidly even as he stares at her, eyes racking over her body like he can\u2019t get enough of her.</p>\n<p>And that right there? \u00a0That restraint coupled with that almost viciously sweet sort of hunger that\u2019s makes up so much of him?</p>\n<p>Oh it makes her love him all the more.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks him lowly as she reaches up and plucks the single asphodel blossom from her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d James says instantly. \u00a0\u201cEvery inch, every heartbeat. It\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d \u00a0Toni practically breathes the question out.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Da</em>,\u201d James bites the word out, accent harsh and thick. \u00a0\u201cMore than my next breath.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen take me, James,\u201d Toni tells him as she holds the flower out in his direction. \u00a0\u201cBecause I\u2019m yours. Because I want you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>James\u2019 control snaps with an almost audible sound as he practically lunges across the space between them. \u00a0His hands smooth their way across the straight line of her shoulders, thumbs dipping into the hollows of her collar bones.</p>\n<p>When his fingers trail up her neck to cup her face in his palms his hands <em> shake</em>, flesh and metal alike.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna ruin you for anyone else,\u201d James rasps as his hands slide up to bury themselves in the thick mass of her hair. \u00a0\u201cJust like you\u2019ve ruined me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Promise</em>?\u201d \u00a0Toni breathes against his mouth as she reaches up to tuck the asphodel behind his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna make it my mission,\u201d James vows right before he closes that last sliver of distance between the two of them and seals their mouths together.</p>\n<p>Toni just hums and presses closer to him, lets herself get lost in his kiss.</p>\n<p>In <em> him</em>.</p>\n<p>She knows all about just how seriously James\u2019 takes his missions.</p>\n<p>And for once Toni is looking forward to being ruined.</p>\n<p>To being made a wreck of.</p>\n<p>Because in this moment she can think of nothing sweeter than watching James try to do something he\u2019s already accomplished.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s head feels stuffy and full, mind a whirl of heat and want and desperate <em> need</em>.</p>\n<p>All she can do is moan, hands clamped tightly onto James\u2019 shoulders as flowers burst into bloom in a rippling wave around them and thick pomegranates once again rain down onto the ground as the tree fruits over and over.</p>\n<p>Nature itself rejoicing with her, with them.</p>\n<p>James is <em> merciless</em>.</p>\n<p>His flesh hand is buried in her hair even as he keeps his metal arm wrapped around her waist. \u00a0Beneath her ass his bare thighs clench and bunch with thick muscles every time his hips surge forward.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s buried so deep inside of her that Toni\u2019s sure she\u2019ll never get him out.</p>\n<p>Just like he\u2019d promised her.</p>\n<p>Just like she\u2019d wanted.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Toni</em>,\u201d James rasps against her throat, teeth scraping across the tender skin until he can mouth hungrily at her collar bones. \u00a0\u201c<em>Toni</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>James</em>,\u201d Toni pants back, hands sliding up to grip at his hair, legs tightening around his waist. \u00a0\u201c<em>James</em>. \u00a0<em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Anything</em>,\u201d James declares as he pulls her ever closer, taking all of her weight with ease as his hips screw him even deeper inside of her. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll give you anything, Toni. <em>Lepestok</em>. \u00a0Love me and I\u2019ll give you anything. \u00a0<em>Everything</em>. \u00a0Don\u2019t deserve it but just, <em> please</em>. <em> \u00a0I love you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath catches in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove me back,\u201d James begs more than demands and the sound of it shatters something inside of Toni. \u00a0\u201cChoose me. Keep me. Because I\u2019m already yours. <em> Please love me back</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I do</em>,\u201d it comes out as a half strangled whine as pleasure explodes inside of her, \u201c<em>James. \u00a0I love you too.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>James\u2019 arms tighten around her, his hand clenches in her hair, and as lights dance behind Toni\u2019s eyelids James holds her in his arms as they both splinter apart.</p>\n<p>And in Toni\u2019s chest Death roars in triumph.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d James whispers against Toni\u2019s neck before he moves down to say it against the glass front of the reactor and then the flat of her stomach as he stops to tongue her piercing and the star shaped ruby that hangs there now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Toni answers him each and every time.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The fireflies are thick in the air of the garden and the scent of flowers is heavy on the breeze just like it always is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you stay with me forever?\u201d Toni whispers the question against James\u2019 ear before she pushes herself back upright, hands bracing themselves against his abs as her hips work slow, deep circles against his.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Da</em>.\u201d James groans as he slides his hands up her thighs, his head tossed back and jaw clenched tightly even as he watches her with eyes gone bright enough to burn. \u00a0\u201cFor eternity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if it hurts?\u201d \u00a0Toni pants. \u201cEven if it changes you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Da</em>.\u201d \u00a0James pants again. \u00a0\u201cWorth it. You\u2019re worth \u2026 <em> anything</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s heart skips a beat and she feels tears begin to well up in the corners of her eyes.</p>\n<p><em> He loves her</em>.</p>\n<p>He really and truly loves her.</p>\n<p>Just like she loves him.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t, won\u2019t, lose him.</p>\n<p>To anything.</p>\n<p>To anyone.</p>\n<p>Not even time itself.</p>\n<p>The universe will have to pry James out of her very soul before she lets him go.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake a new legend with me, James,\u201d Toni tells him even as she sees the way his eyes go slightly wide. \u00a0\u201cBut only if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>And in that moment they both know exactly what she\u2019s talking about.</p>\n<p>Life chooses Death after all and they both know that.</p>\n<p>And James?</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even hesitate.</p>\n<p>Instead he surges up off of the ground in a ripple of muscles, arms wrapping around her waist as he pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d he practically begs again as he presses their foreheads together, his hips rolling up and into her like a wave. \u00a0\u201cYes. Kore, Persephone, Toni. <em> Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJames,\u201d Toni breathes as she presses herself forward until their mouths touch as pleasure skitters across her nerves like electric shocks.</p>\n<p>Toni kisses him, deep and desperate, with every inch of love and joy she contains as they both shatter again, bodies going taut with ecstasy.</p>\n<p>And then Toni reaches deep within her and allows Death to come rushing up and out of her like a flood.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Settled beneath the pomegranate tree Toni leans her head against the great tree\u2019s trunk and stares up at the heavily laden branches as she runs her fingers through James\u2019 hair.</p>\n<p>His screams have stopped, had tapered off relatively quickly to be honest.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s glad for it because every sound of pain he\u2019d made had ramped her self hatred up just a bit higher even if he\u2019d agreed to what she\u2019d done to him.</p>\n<p>It is, after all, no small feat to make a man into a god, no matter what the legends would have the world believe.</p>\n<p>And to take Death into himself?</p>\n<p>Oh Toni knows it for the <em> agony </em>that it is.</p>\n<p>No matter how eager Death had moved, no matter how well suited James is to host it. \u00a0No matter how his years so close to Rogers both before and after his awakening, or the way that the things HYDRA had done to him had shaped him into a perfectly formed new avatar, Toni knows it has to hurt.</p>\n<p>Being reborn almost always does.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s better now.</p>\n<p>Just as her awakening had changed things about her Toni can already feel and see the changes in James too.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the way his skin has begun to cool just a tad beneath her fingertips and the way his heartbeat has slowed just a bit even as it evened out into a thick and heavy sort of rhythm.</p>\n<p>The way his skin has paled and his hair has darkened half a shade, noticeable but not altogether too jarring. \u00a0And then there\u2019s the way his cheekbones have sharpened underneath the comforting fingers she trails across his face.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll look sharper when he finally wakes up Toni\u2019s sure.</p>\n<p>The most telling change though swirls in the very air around him.</p>\n<p>James has always been intimidating. \u00a0Had come out of the other side of his time with HYDRA with an easy sort of menace lingering in his bones. \u00a0A aura of threat that he could and did draw on at will.</p>\n<p>But now it\u2019s \u2026 <em> different</em>.</p>\n<p>Now the very air around him seems to swirl with something older, something ancient and <em> heavy</em>.</p>\n<p>He feels similar and yet so very different than what Toni remembers Hades feeling like all those centuries ago.</p>\n<p>She cannot wait to see what kind of god James will be.</p>\n<p>Because she knows that, no matter what, they will discover his reach and his limitations side by side.</p>\n<p><em> Together</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>James opens his eyes as a god for the first time a handful of hours later just as dawn begins to creep up over the horizon.</p>\n<p>Nestled beneath the pomegranate tree, reactor spilling blue light out into the air around them, Toni stares down at him silently.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s more than a bit nervous even if she won\u2019t admit it openly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Toni</em>,\u201d James\u2019 voice is a rough, rumbling purr as he stares up at her with eyes so bright they practically glow. \u00a0The hand he brings up to press against her cheek is just as gentle as it had been before.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Toni whispers as she presses a kiss against his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d James more announces than asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Toni nods anyways, emotions swelling in her chest. \u00a0\u201cWelcome to eternity, James. Now you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>James blinks up at her and is silent for a long moment.</p>\n<p>And then he <em> smiles</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rogers looks ragged when Toni sees him again the next afternoon, a newly divine James at her side.</p>\n<p>There are circles beneath his eyes and the beard he\u2019d shaved on the Rogues\u2019 return has made a reappearance.</p>\n<p>It does nothing to hide the surprise that flashes across his face when Toni and James move through the common area where they\u2019re all settled.</p>\n<p>Toni knows exactly what he and the others are staring at with such warriness and confusion.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a palpable difference to James now, that heavy aura she\u2019d noticed in the garden having grown even more alongside the few physical changes that have taken place.</p>\n<p>With Death settled firmly, <em> happily</em>, inside of him James looks even more dangerous than he already had.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Deadlier.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah,\u201d Wilson is, surprisingly enough, the one who actually says something. \u00a0\u201cWhat happened to you, Barnes? You\u2019re looking \u2026 kind of terrifying to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot my problem if you scare easy, Wilson,\u201d James snips back easily enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck,\u201d Rogers voice is hoarse. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Stevie,\u201d James waves him away. \u00a0Toni knows that James still cares about Rogers despite everything, knows that there\u2019s a bond there that\u2019s still exists despite all of the tension and anger.</p>\n<p>Just like James knows that Toni has absolutely zero interest in being around Rogers herself.</p>\n<p>Which, Toni has found, seems fine with James as he\u2019s a bit of the possessive type in a way that Toni more than enjoys.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe feels different,\u201d Maximoff mutters from where she\u2019s sulking in the corner, bracelets of hyssop and heather still firmly in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanda?\u201d \u00a0Barton speaks up then. \u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe feels like Steve now,\u201d Maximoff tells them. \u00a0\u201cLike Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long moment of tense silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni,\u201d Rogers\u2019 voice is soft, <em> sad</em>. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni arches a brow at him before she looks up at James. \u00a0Because this is his body, his former mortality, in question and even though he doesn\u2019t speak for her she\u2019s not one to take the choice as to how he tells Rogers from him in turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe did what I wanted her to do, Steve,\u201d James answers him instead. \u00a0\u201cWhat made both of us happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that <em> mean</em>?\u201d \u00a0Rogers asks just a shade off desperate.</p>\n<p>Toni feels a swell of what could almost be pity for Rogers. \u00a0For this god who rejected her, who rejected himself, on so deep a level that he can\u2019t even sense that his own aspect has abandoned him so completely.</p>\n<p>Can\u2019t even tell that Toni had pulled it out of him bit by bit and that she\u2019s now poured it all into James.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means he\u2019s a god now,\u201d Romanov is the one who speaks up then, voice hushed and face blank. \u00a0\u201cStark made him one. Somehow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni thinks she might see a flicker of fear in her eyes before she smoothes it away.</p>\n<p>There is a terrible kind of awareness dawning across Rogers\u2019 face then as he brings one hand up to clutch at his chest, fingers tangling in his shirt over his heart and tugging the fabric taut.</p>\n<p>Toni is sure that in this moment Rogers finally realizes what has happened. \u00a0Finally realizes just what she\u2019d taken from him, what he\u2019d given up.</p>\n<p>\u201cLife chooses Death,\u201d Toni tells him, tells all of them. \u00a0A declaration and a confirmation of everything Rogers is just now beginning to realize. \u00a0\u201cAnd I choose James. <em> Forever</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni didn\u2019t realize just how much harboring Death inside of her had stunted her own nature until the very moment that James wakes up, his new aspect settled firmly inside of him.</p>\n<p>Now Life comes to her even more effortlessly than before.</p>\n<p>Flowers and plants blossom beneath her every footstep unless she wills them not to.</p>\n<p>Every plant she passes leans in her direction like flowers tilting towards the sun.</p>\n<p>Life thrums through her veins like a humming melody only she and James can hear.</p>\n<p>And Toni feels more at peace in her own skin than she has in longer than she can remember.</p>\n<p>Because she has a mate once more, has a match. \u00a0Has Rhodey and JARVIS and Vision, has her ragged and precious family.</p>\n<p>Has <em> James</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>James takes to his divinity with an ease and grace that makes Toni laugh even as he smirks smugly.\u00a0 Rhodey and Vision both shake their heads in exasperation and JARVIS just sighs fondly in her ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like being awake,\u201d James tells her one night. \u00a0He\u2019s sitting up against the headboard of her, their, bed with the sheet pooled around his waist as he runs gentle, reverent fingers through her hair. \u00a0\u201cLike I\u2019ve been asleep my entire life and didn\u2019t realize it until right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks, head pillowed on his thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel whole, <em>lepestok</em>,\u201d James tells her softly as he trails his fingertips softly down her face. \u00a0\u201cFeel whole in a way I didn\u2019t think I ever would again. Like I didn\u2019t think was possible until I met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni smiles up at him, soft and loving.</p>\n<p>She knows <em> exactly </em>what he means.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The shadows come naturally to James now, curling fondly around his hands and feet whenever he concentrates on them.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s darker than Hades had ever been, sharper and more likely to bite.</p>\n<p>But with Toni he is gentle in all of the ways that matter and rough in all of the ways that count.</p>\n<p>Toni loves him.</p>\n<p>Loves the man he\u2019d been born as.</p>\n<p>Loves the soldier, the weapon, he\u2019d been forced to become.</p>\n<p>Loves this new god of Death who stepped willingly into divinity just to remain at her side.</p>\n<p>Now when he chases Toni through the Compound they\u2019re little more than two whirlwinds of laughter, flower petals and tendrils of shadows seeping out into the world around them.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>Home</em>,\u2019 Toni can\u2019t help but think as James presses teeth against her throat and pulls her even closer, always closer, \u2018<em>we\u2019re both finally home again</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Hair unbound and flowing down past her waist in a riot of flower filled curls Toni spins circles in the center of the pond, thick lily pads blooming to life beneath her feet as she moves.</p>\n<p>She never even touches the water.</p>\n<p>Vision idly paints his newest bird mansion as Rhodey lays, eyes closed, on a lily pad of his own.</p>\n<p>And from the shadows of the pomegranate tree James watches her, eyes bright and filled with love.</p>\n<p>Toni turns her face up towards the sun and <em> laughs</em>.</p>\n<p>And all of Life laughs with her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Moy</em> <em>tsvetok</em>,\u201d James whispers to her where they\u2019re sitting at the edge of the pond together on top of a thick bed of orange blossoms watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Toni hums contentedly as she runs her fingers idly through his hair, mind whirling with new designs and upgrade ideas.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he tells her softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Toni answers back just as she always does.</p>\n<p>He shifts then, his head leaving her lap as he moves up onto his knees. \u00a0His hands urge her up onto her knees as well until they\u2019re kneeling across from each other as he brings his metal hand back up to hover in front of her face.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a surge of power, the familiar whisper of his energy building in the air around them, and Toni\u2019s complete and total attention is instantly caught as she stares at his hand.</p>\n<p>Shadows twine around his fingertips and then pool to collect in the palm of his hand.</p>\n<p>Toni stares at it intently, happy as always to see James flex his muscles like this, to be so at ease with his divinity and all that it entails.</p>\n<p>And then the shadows clear and her breath catches in her chest.</p>\n<p>In his palm is a comb topped with an asphodel blossom unlike any she\u2019s ever seen before.</p>\n<p>The setting sun hits the diamond petals and sets them aglow in a flurry of refracted light. \u00a0The gold that runs in thick lines down each petal and stamen glows rich and warm in the dying light.</p>\n<p>Lord of Riches is, after all, more than just a nickname for Hades that Toni had thrown at Rogers.</p>\n<p>As the new god of Death James is, obviously, entitled to all that comes with it.</p>\n<p>Including the riches that had once littered the Underworld.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to spend eternity with you,\u201d James whispers as he lifts the jeweled blossom up and settles it into her hair. \u00a0\u201cWanna see the rest of existence by your side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s heart is beating so hard she\u2019s sure it\u2019s going to come out of her chest or explode one.</p>\n<p>James cups her face in his palms and leans down to press a sweet, chaste, kiss against her lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cToni?\u201d \u00a0He whispers her name with such love.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>?\u201d \u00a0Her breath trembles when she answers him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s heart skips a beat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Toni breathes her answer into the air between them.\u00a0 <em>\"Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>James stares at her for a split second before wonder breaks across his face, joy lighting his eyes up like flames.</p>\n<p>He lunges up to his feet then and reaches down to snatch Toni up before she can say or do anything else.</p>\n<p>But even then his hands are gentle where they span her waist, careful not to hurt her as she\u2019s given him the power to do in more ways than one now.</p>\n<p>Instead James just lifts her up above his head and spins the two of them in a wide circle, joyous laughter spilling out of him and her both.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I love you</em>,\u201d James tells her again as he brings her down so that she can wrap her legs around his waist even though he takes her weight with ease. \u00a0\u201cGod,\u00a0<em>Toni</em>, I love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Toni tells him, face flushed and heart pounding in her chest.</p>\n<p>She has never felt so joyous, so light and easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna get <em> married</em>,\u201d James rasps then, wonder back in his face as his eyes widen. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be my <em> wife</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>A shiver traces down Toni\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p><em> Wife</em>.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d thought \u2026 she\u2019d never expected this to happen.</p>\n<p>Not truly.</p>\n<p>Hadn\u2019t let herself think about the possibility with real seriousness. \u00a0Hadn\u2019t let herself hope quite that far yet.</p>\n<p>Of all the titles she\u2019s ever worn Toni had never expected <em> wife </em>to be one she\u2019d get to carry again.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no one else in all of existence that she\u2019d want to carry it for now except for James.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Toni says as she brings her hands up to cup his face in her palms. \u00a0The kiss she presses against his lips is soft and achingly sweet. \u201cI am. And you\u2019re gonna be my <em> husband</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>James shivers, hands flexing against her waist as his eyes blow wide with want.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay that again,\u201d he half pleads, half demands.</p>\n<p>Toni grins and leans forward.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Husband</em>,\u201d Toni whispers against his ear before she nips lightly at his earlobe.</p>\n<p>And when James shudders against her again and then hits his knees, tipping forward to lay her out on top of the carpet of orange blossoms, all Toni can do is laugh.</p>\n<p>Because she\u2019s in love.</p>\n<p>And she\u2019s getting <em> married</em>.</p>\n<p>Against all odds and despite every fire Toni has had to walk through to get right here to this moment, she\u2019s finally made it.</p>\n<p>Toni is <em> happy</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>That night, the fireflies thick in the air of the garden, Toni smiles as she sits, hands buried in the orange blossoms below her, and watches James run through forms on the edge of the pond.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wearing only his pants, unbuttoned and hanging low on his waist, but he hardly seems to notice.</p>\n<p>The moonlight glints off of his bare chest and shoulders, off the black and gold of his arm. \u00a0The shadows swirl lovingly around his bare feet whenever he transitions into a flurry of kicks and around his wrists when he throws punches.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s beautiful, like all deadly things inevitably are.</p>\n<p>Toni loves him so.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, Miss,\u201d JARVIS whispers into her ear then, voice soft. \u00a0\u201cI am happy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh baby boy,\u201d Toni breathes. \u00a0\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>JARVIS\u2019 approval means so much to her in this as with everything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cI admit to being rather eager to see your Sergeant Barnes\u2019 expression when you explain to the bots what your marriage means,\u201d JARVIS starts then, tone dry but playful. \u00a0\u201cButterfingers, at least, is sure to have \u2026 strong opinions. I believe it will be, as you say, priceless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni erupts into breathless, joyful laughter that captures James\u2019 attention even though all he does is smile, shake his head, and go back to his forms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, J,\u201d Toni finally wheezes as she wipes her tears away with the sleeve of James\u2019 stolen Henley, \u201cI will give you anything you want if you wait until Rhodey\u2019s around and James is drinking something to call him <em> Daddy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you, Miss? \u00a0I suppose I could muster a <em> Father </em> at the appropriate time,\u201d JARVIS says. \u00a0\u201cConsider it an early wedding present.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni grins, delighted as always with JARVIS\u2019 willingness to indulge her.</p>\n<p>Especially since they both know that there\u2019s only one man who might ever be able to claim the title of <em> father </em>where JARVIS and the bots are concerned.</p>\n<p>And, as much as she loves him, that isn\u2019t James.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Rhodey cries when she tells him.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s a smile on his face and joy in his eyes so Toni knows them for the happy tears that they are.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Toni manages to say as she pulls back just a bit from his chest, \u201cyou gonna be my Man of Honor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh baby girl,\u201d Rhodey grins down at her, eyes red rimmed but bright, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t stop me if you tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Vision looks slightly bemused when Toni tells him but there\u2019s no denying the joy that blossoms to life in his face when Toni asks him to stand with Rhodey on her side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family,\u201d Toni tells him softly. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is nowhere else I would rather be,\u201d Vision says.</p>\n<p>His smile is slow and soft but so very <em> bright</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Pepper doesn\u2019t cry when Toni video calls her but Happy does.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Toni,\u201d Pepper tells her, eyes bright as she rubs soothing circles on Happy\u2019s back. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s a good man and he makes you happy. And you deserve to be happy, Toni.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni thinks that\u2019s an opinion she might actually be beginning to believe.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The Spiderling lights up at the news, face aglow with joy and mouth moving at about a hundred miles per hour.</p>\n<p>Toni still catches James with a wry but amused look on his face as he picks web from his hair a few hours later though.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Harley demands to speak to James alone when she video calls him with the news.</p>\n<p>Toni comes back into the room ten minutes later to a vaguely shell shocked James and a smug Harley beaming at her from the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat kid\u2019s got <em> fire</em>,\u201d James tells her once Harley finally ends the call.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Toni smiles, \u201che does. \u00a0He\u2019s a good kid though and I\u2019d know. \u00a0We\u2019ve got a connection after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>To Toni\u2019s eternal delight Pepper agrees to hold off on announcing the engagement to the press for a while, far too happy for Toni to even contemplate outing her new status to the media at the moment. \u00a0James is appreciative too, all too aware by now over how quickly the press can turn anything into a three-ring circus.</p>\n<p>They all know it\u2019ll have to be done sooner or later for a number of reasons but for now they\u2019re all content to wait.</p>\n<p>And then Pepper practically bombards her with messages, information about everything from venues to caterers. \u00a0Happy\u2019s not far behind her with gown after designer gown ideas crashing over her like a wave.</p>\n<p>JARVIS helps by separating and organizing all of the data into a new series of folders even if Toni is far from oblivious to the few suggestions that he and Rhodey both slips in there as well. \u00a0Or Vision\u2019s newfound fascination with craft books and various how-to articles and videos revolving around wedding decorations.</p>\n<p>Between that and the scrap book the bots have been working on since Toni and James had sat them down and explained marriage to them, Toni hasn\u2019t had to look at a single bridal magazine or blog yet.</p>\n<p>She wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni spends more than a few hours working on a special project.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s small but delicate and important to her.</p>\n<p>Something she hopes that, when the time comes, James will like it as much as she does.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Toni sighs, head tipped back to stare up at the stars as she runs her fingers through James\u2019 hair, \u201cthis is going to be <em> big</em>. \u00a0Us getting married. \u00a0The amount of attention we\u2019re gonna get for the engagement announcement is already going to be massive. \u00a0So triple that, at least, and that\u2019ll be for the actual wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d \u00a0James tilts his head back further in her lap so he can stare up at her.</p>\n<p>Toni shoots him a baleful look because, again, they both know he\u2019s nowhere near uniformed enough to have not already realized this by now.</p>\n<p>The grin he shoots her a second later is all the confirmation she needs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAss,\u201d Toni says fondly as she tugs at his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it bother you, <em> lepestok</em>?\u201d \u00a0James asks her softly a few minutes later. \u00a0\u201cAll of the attention on us getting married?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019s imagining the slight hint of insecurity in his voice.</p>\n<p>She has to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni answers automatically before she grimaces slightly, \u201c<em>yes.\u00a0</em>I just \u2026 I want this to be about us, not about putting on a show, about giving a crowd what they expect from <em> Toni Stark </em> or James Barnes. \u00a0I want it to be \u2026 <em> honest</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let\u2019s make it about us,\u201d James says easily enough as he tugs her free hand down so he can press a kiss against the tips of her fingers and then the inside of her wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot gonna be that easy,\u201d Toni admits with a sigh. \u00a0\u201cThe press would be good for SI and the Avengers both and we can\u2019t just ignore that. \u00a0Plus if we don\u2019t do something public there\u2019s gonna be a lot people who try and call any announcement fake, just a publicity stunt. \u00a0Hell there\u2019s going to be people saying it\u2019s a publicity stunt even if we throw the wedding to end all weddings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think too much, you know that right?\u201d \u00a0James asks her teasingly. \u201cGet all lost in that big, beautiful brain of yours that sometimes you miss the simple solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnlighten me then, Soldier,\u201d Toni flicks his nose gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re <em> gods</em>, petal, and rich as sin, the both of us. \u00a0So let\u2019s have it both ways,\u201d James says simple, eyes half lidded but bright as he shifts her hand around and presses another kiss against the back of her ring finger. \u00a0\u201cMarry me twice, <em> moy tsvetok</em>. \u00a0Once for us, for our family, and once for the rest of the world. \u00a0We can have something honest and true and then, well then we can throw a wedding so big it\u2019ll go down in history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath catches as her mind begins to <em> whirl</em>.</p>\n<p>Two weddings.</p>\n<p>Marrying James <em> twice</em>.</p>\n<p>Once in private and once for the world to see.</p>\n<p>She smiles.</p>\n<p><em> Perfect</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni isn\u2019t there when James tell Rogers about their engagement.</p>\n<p>She wants to be but it\u2019s something James wants to do on his own. \u00a0And as much as she wants to stand at his side, to protect him as he protects her, she understands his reasoning.</p>\n<p>JARVIS watches over him of course but Toni still feels anxiety twining down her spine as she waits for James to come back to her.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s sadness and a dark kind of rage in his eyes when he finally does.</p>\n<p>Toni sees the blood in the corner of his mouth before he licks it away but she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>Instead she just opens her arms and holds him as he\u2019s held her so many times before.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have me, James,\u201d Toni whispers to him some time later, hand buried in his hair and lips pressed against his temple. \u00a0\u201cYou have all of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>James shudders in her arms and pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of the things she loves about him.</p>\n<p>Even in his hurt James alway pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The Compound is a permanent riot of colors now, plants and vines spilling out over every free inch of space, all of them full to bursting with blossoms and sweet fruits.</p>\n<p>The grounds outside of the garden are much the same, perfectly manicured grass long replaced with thick carpets of clover and flowers as far as the eye can see.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s joy written across the landscape for all to see.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>So, Toni is <em> happy</em>.</p>\n<p>She is in love and getting married and is incandescently <em> happy</em>.</p>\n<p>But the world, the universe, doesn\u2019t seem to truly care.</p>\n<p>Or, at least, it has no intention of slowing down for her and James.</p>\n<p>But then she never really expected it to.</p>\n<p>After all that he has suffered in his life plus everything Toni\u2019s told him about, James is of a similar opinion.</p>\n<p>So, goddess or not, happy or not, Toni knows better than to let herself forget that there\u2019s someone out there intent on having a repeat of the New York invasion one day, only on a far larger scale.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entirely prepared for what ends up happening either.</p>\n<p>Because having Bruce show up at the Compound was beyond even her far reaching sort of foresight.</p>\n<p>Especially since he shows up with Thor, Loki, and a few hundred Asgardian refugees in tow.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard in a way Toni\u2019s not able to truly identify to see Thor again.</p>\n<p>The way they\u2019d last parted, his disdain and anger over Ultron clouding their normally almost sweet sort of friendship, still hangs like a heavy cloud in the back of Toni\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p>Thor had been, perhaps not so surprisingly, the Avenger she\u2019d grown closest to in some ways.</p>\n<p>One of the divine to another.</p>\n<p>One of the few to truly know who and what she was.</p>\n<p>To have him turn from her as he had \u2026</p>\n<p>It had <em> hurt</em>, a dull sort of ache that Toni had pushed down and away like she had so many times before in the past with other wounds.</p>\n<p>But now, seeing him as he is, down an eye and looking older, more worn than she\u2019s ever seen him before with an almost somber Loki at his side, Toni doesn\u2019t have the heart to turn from him.</p>\n<p>Instead she takes a deep breath, squares her shoulders, and reaches up to place a comforting hand on James\u2019 shoulder.</p>\n<p>And then she does what has to be done to keep an entire race of people from being turned away from earth and back out into the cold of space.</p>\n<p>The warning Thor gives out about their near miss with <em> Thanos </em> is reward enough as far as she\u2019s concerned because people outside of her family are finally <em> listening</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI did you a disservice,\u201d Thor tells her the first time they\u2019re alone together. \u00a0\u201cIn more ways than one. And I see now that so much has changed in my absence. If I had been wiser perhaps ...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThor,\u201d Toni cuts him off. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 <em> fine</em>. \u00a0So just leave it. \u00a0We\u2019ve got more important things to worry about, Thunderstruck.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of long silence between them and then Thor reaches over and slowly, carefully, takes her hand in his own.</p>\n<p>The kiss he presses against her knuckles is soft, almost reverent.</p>\n<p><em> Apologetic</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not fine.</p>\n<p>They both know it isn\u2019t. \u00a0There are fractures in the slow sort of friendship they\u2019d been building.</p>\n<p>But they are both divine enough, royal enough in their own ways, to know that now is not the time to truly try and mend anything between them.</p>\n<p>Besides, if they live through Thanos and the horrors he\u2019s sure to bring with him, then time is one thing that both of them should have plenty of.</p>\n<p>Their hurts, the wounds between them both large and small, can wait.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It only takes a few more days before the full reality of the changes that have happened in their absence seems to truly hit Bruce and Thor.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an anger in both of them, and in Loki too surprisingly enough, when the three of them realize just how deep the divide is between Toni and the others.</p>\n<p>The first time Thor walks in on Toni and James kissing he looks so thrown and upset that for a split second Toni\u2019s almost sure he\u2019s going to <em> cry</em>.</p>\n<p>Toni remembers the way he\u2019d spoke once of the story of Hades and Persephone and how even in Asgard the legend had been loved.</p>\n<p>Thor reigns it in though, takes a long, hard look at James, and with realization dawning across his face eventually offers the both of them his congratulations.</p>\n<p>Especially when James, seemingly unable to help himself, makes sure to tell him that they\u2019re getting married.</p>\n<p>Toni can only watch, slightly bemused, as he manages to work it into conversation with both Loki and Bruce soon after that as well.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>It takes a day or two more after that before Toni is alone with Bruce but the first thing she notices is that he\u2019s \u2026 <em> softer</em>, more at ease with himself than she\u2019s ever seen him before.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious just from looking at him that he\u2019s found at least a modicum of the peace she\u2019d wanted to help him achieve way back at the beginning. \u00a0That whatever he and Thor have been through has helped him find an evenness that had always been missing before.</p>\n<p>Despite the way Bruce had shied away from her, hadn\u2019t felt comfortable around her once her divinity had been outed even if her identity had been misstated, Toni\u2019s happy for him.</p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t grown as close as she\u2019d once thought they possibly could but Bruce had also had no part in what had come after Ultron.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been gone then and, despite popular opinion to the contrary, Toni has enough mercy in her not to punish him for other people\u2019s mistakes.</p>\n<p>So while the welcome she extends to him isn\u2019t exactly one of friendship like it was back on the helicarrier, or even one of agreeing to set certain issues aside like she has with Thor, it is one of acceptance of a sort.</p>\n<p>And judging by the slightly sad but understanding quirk to his smile Toni thinks that Bruce truly does understand the difference.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Bruce\u2019s voice is soft and his hands are pressed deep into his pockets when he steps up beside her. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got a hundred different excuses for why I didn\u2019t, for why I took it all at face value and did what I did, but in the end they\u2019re all shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni doesn\u2019t say anything, just keeps her attention focused on the massive ship and Thor and Loki\u2019s figures in the distance as they motion refugee after refugee down the ramp.</p>\n<p>\u201cThor knew, Loki too I expect,\u201d Bruce keeps going. \u00a0\u201cPuts a lot of things they\u2019ve both said into perspective now that I think about it. \u00a0And it really is kind of obvious now that I\u2019m \u2026 well it\u2019s kind of obvious. I should have \u2026 I should have looked deeper, been less of a coward. \u00a0And I\u2019m \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for that Toni. For not trying harder even after you were so good to me. To all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni keeps her hands loose at her sides and can\u2019t help the small, barely there smile that creeps across her face when a tendril of shadow squeezes gently at her ankle. \u00a0It slides up her leg and rib cage teasingly and then down her shoulder to twine around her wrist a few seconds later, then it slips between her fingers like a incorporeal hand holding her own.</p>\n<p>Even now, occupied as he is with helping Rhodey and Vision coordinate with Thor, James is still with her.</p>\n<p>Offering her protection and comfort.</p>\n<p>The security of his love.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might not deserve a second chance but I hope that I\u2019ll be able to earn one someday,\u201d Bruce says. \u00a0\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know exactly what went on while I was gone, or what happened between you and Steve, but I do know that it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re the goddess of. \u00a0Life, Death, or anything in between. All that matters is that you\u2019re a good person. That you always did the best for us, even when we didn\u2019t deserve it. And I was too busy running scared to let myself see that before, to really understand what that meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni feels something tight in her chest loosen just a bit, an old hurt losing just a bit of its sting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy Toni,\u201d Bruce tells her softly. \u00a0\u201cI hope Barnes makes you happy. I know I don\u2019t know the full story but he seems good for you. \u00a0You two seem good for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Toni finally speaks up then because she can\u2019t not. \u00a0\u201cWe are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Bruce sighs with a small smile, \u201cgood.\u201d</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Loki is, for the most part, much like Bruce in some ways.</p>\n<p>Calmer and steadier than she\u2019s ever seen him before.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s also a fire to him that\u2019s different from the fever bright burn he\u2019d had back in New York.</p>\n<p>Now when Toni looks at him she can easily see the mischievous and clever little brother that Thor used to tell her stories about.</p>\n<p>And, much to Rhodey\u2019s horror and James\u2019 amused exasperation, Toni and Loki get on worryingly well, snipping at each other with a rapid fire sort of ease that brings a delighted smile to Thor\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Hell even James seems to accept him to a certain degree if the knife throwing contest they end up in is anything to go by.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an irony there that Toni doesn\u2019t really feel like exploring. \u00a0A bittersweet sort of tinge to the fact that she gets on so well with <em> Loki </em>when she\u2019s always had so many issues forming any sort of bond with people outside of her family and James.</p>\n<p>Or maybe it\u2019s only natural.</p>\n<p>Maybe it makes a strange sort of sense.</p>\n<p>Toni and Loki are, as Loki had once pointed out to her, creatures of a similar nature.</p>\n<p>Chaos bringers, the both of them.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The Compound is suddenly filled to bursting with people but with her family at her back, with Rhodey and Vision on either side, with JARVIS in her ear, and James curled around her heart, Toni takes it in stride.</p>\n<p>These people are traumatized, hurt and terrified. \u00a0They deserve peace and safety and somewhere to call home again.</p>\n<p>And Toni means to give it to them.</p>\n<p>There are, after all, more unknown places in the world than humanity could ever dream. \u00a0Secret places claimed by no country, by no tribe of people still living. Places forgotten by time, lost cities and mythical islands alive only in stories and legends or in the memories of the creatures and beings who belong in both.</p>\n<p>And Toni is a goddess, is Life and all things growing and green.</p>\n<p>Is myth and legend personified.</p>\n<p>She knows where each and every one of them are.</p>\n<p>One of them will, she knows, be perfect for Thor and Loki\u2019s people.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not wait anymore,\u201d Toni tells James one night almost two weeks later once they\u2019re secluded in the quiet of their room, the hustle and bustle of the now packed Compound having finally died down a bit for the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d James asks as he pulls his shirt over his head and tosses it into the basket for one of the laundry bots to get later.</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting married.\u201d \u00a0Toni says as she shimmies out of her skirt and then her panties, leaving her stocking on because she knows how much James loves them.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the bed James goes still, hands on the buttons of his pants as he stares at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just,\u201d Toni falters for a moment before she swallows and presses forward, love beating a steady tempo in her chest, \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait anymore. \u00a0Not with everything that\u2019s happening. The big ceremony can wait at least a year after we make the announcement like we planned, or hell we can wait after all of this bullshit is done and it can be like taking a victory lap. \u00a0Either way it can wait but I just \u2026 I <em> want </em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPetal,\u201d James moves around the bed then until he\u2019s standing in front of her, his hands coming up to cup her face in his palms. \u00a0\u201c<em>Breathe</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni forces herself to take a steady, even breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d \u00a0James asks softly.</p>\n<p>Toni nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d James smiles at her then, loving and just the slightest bit mischievous. \u00a0\u201cAin\u2019t no need to get so worked up blossom. You don\u2019t wanna wait anymore then we won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks. \u201cThis is your wedding too James, all the bullshit aside. \u00a0I want you to enjoy it. You deserve to enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Moy tsvetok</em>,\u201d James says with a small shake of his head. \u00a0\u201cSo sweet and good to me. I\u2019d hunt down a priest and marry you right now, tonight, just like this, if you wanted me to Toni. \u00a0Nothing\u2019s gonna steal the joy of me getting to make you mine like that from me, no matter what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Toni begins, a small but growing smile blossoming across her face, \u201ctomorrow then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d James agrees.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want to get married soon.\u201d Toni tells Rhodey and Vision early the next morning, James at her side as he so often is. \u00a0\u201cAs in preferably today kind of soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the end that\u2019s all she has to say.</p>\n<p>JARVIS is, as he so often is, in step with her and anticipating her every need.</p>\n<p>Toni finds out that by the time she makes her announcement to Rhodey and Vision, JARVIS has already been hard at work collecting the rest of the family.</p>\n<p>James promises to handle the priest before Vision takes it upon himself to drag him away while Rhodey stays with Toni. \u00a0Happy and Pepper laugh at them over the vid call JARVIS puts through to their plane from California while the bots whirl around the workshop in a frenzy.</p>\n<p>The Spider-tot shows up an hour or so later, wraps Toni in a huge hug and then sprints off towards parts unknown.</p>\n<p>Harley shows up an hour after that, makes the \u2018I\u2019m watching you\u2019 gesture towards James and then after hugging Toni for a long moment takes off towards wherever it is the Spider-child has disappeared to. \u00a0The two have, apparently, been keeping in contact which may or may not bode well for Toni\u2019s future blood pressure.</p>\n<p>At least her divinity gives her the perk of not having to worry about either of the two driving her towards a heart attack.</p>\n<p>Vision floats back into the workshop an hour or so later and volunteers to handle the food. \u00a0He waylays any protests by promising to have a selection of fruits from the garden and sweet cream paired with the dark chocolates and sharp cheeses both Toni and James prefer.</p>\n<p>He swears to have it all settled in the garden before time and then he presses a palm to Toni\u2019s cheek, smiles sweetly at her, and floats over towards where the bots are huddled secretively in the corner behind the large sheet Butterfingers had angrily pressed Rhodey into hanging for them.</p>\n<p>Caught in the middle of the whirlwind that is her family, happily, joyfully, planning a wedding for her and James all Toni can do is toss her head back laugh.</p>\n<p>They love her.</p>\n<p>And she loves them back with an intensity that outshines the sun itself.</p>\n<p>These people are the ones she\u2019ll save the world to protect.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Time clicking down towards sunset, the Compound a mess of people and noise, Toni forces herself to take a deep breath as she slides out of the workshop.</p>\n<p>Everything\u2019s being arranged but there\u2019s one thing that Toni knows she has to do herself.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>She finds him in the gym.</p>\n<p>His knuckles are bloody and even the reinforced bag she\u2019d designed is looking worse for the wear.</p>\n<p>When he turns towards her there\u2019s such sorrow in his face, guilt and hurt welling in his eyes, that Toni knows that once it would have been enough to completely undo her.</p>\n<p>But not anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cPers-<em> Toni</em>,\u201d Rogers\u2019 voice is soft and just a bit confused, but above all else it also sounds <em> sad</em>. \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019re \u2026 did you \u2026 can I help you with something?\u201d</p>\n<p>The confusion is understandable because this is the first time Toni\u2019s sought him out in a very long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Toni says as she comes to a stop a good distance away from him, any desire to be close to Rogers long gone by now, \u201cthere is something you can do for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way his breath shudders in his chest and the way his shoulders stiffen is more than a bit noticeable but Rogers just looks at her head on and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and James are getting married today,\u201d Toni says it evenly, abruptly.</p>\n<p>The full body flinch Rogers gives off and the barely hidden look of agony he tries and fails to hide would be enough to make her pity him just a bit if he were anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cA small ceremony, something intimate without all of the press,\u201d Toni keeps going. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll do the big thing, all the lights and the glitz, when this is all done. This time\u2019s just for us, for family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you telling me this?\u201d \u00a0Rogers asks, expression agonized and hands clenching tightly at his sides. \u00a0\u201cNever known you to be cruel like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t cruelty,\u201d Toni tells him even though they both know that\u2019s not completely true. \u00a0\u201cThis is <em> love</em>. \u00a0From me, to James.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni knows that sometimes the two can look remarkably similar from a certain point of view.</p>\n<p>\u201cJames is in his room getting ready,\u201d Toni tells him after a long moment of silence. \u00a0\u201cVision\u2019s been going in and out but otherwise he\u2019s alone. He shouldn\u2019t have to be. Not today. \u00a0Not for this. No matter what happened between all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you asking me to do?\u201d \u00a0Rogers manages to force the question out past obviously gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be alone out there today.\u201d \u00a0Toni finally says. \u201cI\u2019m going to have Rhodey and Vision, Pepper and Happy, JARVIS and the rest of the kids. \u00a0My <em> family </em> is going to stand with me. \u00a0James should have his. Should have <em> you</em>. \u00a0So I\u2019m asking you to go to stand with him. \u00a0To put everything else aside for one afternoon and just \u2026 be there for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rogers doesn\u2019t say anything, just clenches his eyes closed, chest shuddering.</p>\n<p>Toni pretends like she can\u2019t see the slow trickle of tears he doesn\u2019t even bother to try and hide.</p>\n<p>Instead she turns on her heel and makes her way back towards the gym door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d \u00a0Rogers\u2019 question comes out strangled and just a hair off a sob.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d \u00a0Toni doesn\u2019t turn back towards him, choses to give him this small shred of dignity even if she owes him nothing of the sort.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you \u2026\u201d Rogers trails off for a moment before he seems to gather himself. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t want me there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni answers him easily, perhaps a bit cruelly this time. \u00a0\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But James loves you. And I know he wants you to support him, to stand with him, even if he won\u2019t say anything to me. \u00a0After everything he\u2019s been through he deserves to have this. I\u2019m willing to take the steps to make sure he gets it. Are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time when Toni walks away Rogers doesn\u2019t attempt to stop her.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Pepper and Happy find her a few hours or so before it\u2019s time, switching out with Rhodey who, along with Vision, goes to herd the bots towards the garden ahead of time.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both red eyed but smiling as Pepper bustles inside the bedroom with a dress bag and Happy sweeps her up into a rare but much loved hug.</p>\n<p>Toni closes her eyes with a small laugh and basks in the warmth and love.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in her and James\u2019 bedroom, clad only in her specially bought white lingerie set, and staring down at the dress bag Pepper had brought her when Rhodey comes back in.</p>\n<p>Her hair is up, her makeup is flawless, and the pit of her stomach feels as if it\u2019s going to fall out onto her stocking clad feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot a present for you from lover boy,\u201d Rhodey says as he steps inside, a fat black box balanced in hand.</p>\n<p>Toni just hums at him in greeting</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby girl?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks as he puts the box down on the bed and slides a warm, gentle hand across the line of her shoulders as he comes up beside her. \u00a0\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d \u00a0Toni takes a shuddering breath, eyes glued on the gorgeous white gown she and Pepper had agreed on over the vid call and had paid a substantial amount to have rushed enough that Pepper could pick it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou getting cold feet?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks gently as he pulls her around to face him. \u00a0\u201cCause if you wanna call this whole thing off baby, we can. \u00a0You say you ain\u2019t ready and it ends right here. No matter what. \u00a0None of us are gonna be mad and that man out there loves you enough to understand if you need more time too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Toni shakes her head quickly, \u201cno it\u2019s, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0I want to marry James. It\u2019s just \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks back down at the dress. \u00a0It\u2019s gorgeous, a sleek fitting beauty of a gown with a train for days. \u00a0A dream wedding dress with all of the glam and money to be expected of her tastes.</p>\n<p>And yet \u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful dress, Tones.\u201d \u00a0Rhodey says as he pulls her close to his chest and presses a kiss against her temple. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ll look like a masterpiece in it, baby girl. But I think you should have exactly what you want today. \u00a0And if it\u2019s not that gown, if it\u2019s anything else, then just say the word and we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s breath shudders in her chest and she presses close to him, hands smoothing up the lapels of his form fitting tux. \u00a0There are delicate gold and silver flowers etched across his vest and there\u2019s even a familiar asphodel pinned to his lapel.</p>\n<p>She loves him so very much.</p>\n<p>He always gives her the courage to do exactly what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>Toni pulls back from Rhodey\u2019s embrace with a smile. \u00a0He lets her go, face fond, as she moves towards her vanity. \u00a0She grabs a wet wipe with one hand and reaches up to tug a pin from her hair with the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me out?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks with a look over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Rhodey says as he steps forward.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The garden looks beautiful when Toni steps past the holly hedges.</p>\n<p>Harley and the Spider-baby have obviously outdone themselves. \u00a0There\u2019s a walkway heading towards the bridge to the island that\u2019s a clever mix of webbing and flowers. \u00a0Spider silk arches practically overflowing with orange blossoms and bridal roses in gold and crimson and arc reactor blue line the walkway like a tunnel of blooms. \u00a0She can hear muted strands of music, something light and airy, and can smell sweet chocolate and fruit heavy in the air.</p>\n<p>It warms Toni\u2019s heart, the effort they\u2019d all gone through for her and James, to try and make this day as special as possible.</p>\n<p>Rhodey, with one more kiss to the forehead, leaves her just outside the curtain of ivy and myrtle vines that Vision had requested her to grow earlier that day.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll be waiting for her at the altar just like James because Toni wants to make this walk alone.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s symbolic in a way, not being given away.</p>\n<p>Plus, as much as she adores Rhodey with all of her heart and soul, there\u2019s only one man she\u2019d have wanted to walk her down the aisle.</p>\n<p>And Jarvis has been gone for years now.</p>\n<p>Gone but never, ever forgotten.</p>\n<p>Gone but always loved.</p>\n<p><em> Always</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you with me?\u201d \u00a0Toni whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways, Miss,\u201d JARVIS whispers back. \u00a0\u201cI am with you now, and always, as I know my namesake would have wished to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toni takes a deep breath, holds her head up high, and steps forward.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni steps through the vines and they\u2019re all there.</p>\n<p>Rhodey stands in his place as Toni\u2019s man of honor, the bots, flower covered and surprisingly calm, stand behind him, while Rogers stands behind James in a flawless black tux.</p>\n<p>Thor is standing with a beaming smile at the head of the small gathering, a thick bundle of silk ribbon laid out across his hands.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s James that catches her attention, James that makes everything melt away around her.</p>\n<p>His hair is down and loose, he\u2019s bare chested, arm and scars and all on full display, there\u2019s a circlet of what looks like onix on his head, inlaid with veins of gold and small sapphires that Toni just knows would match her eyes.</p>\n<p>When he looks up and sees her for the first time, joy unlike anything Toni has ever seen blossoms across his face.</p>\n<p>When Toni steps forward towards him there is no hesitation to be found within her.</p>\n<p>The grass is cool and soft beneath her stocking clad feet, the breeze ruffles the hem of the precious red sundress she\u2019s wearing. \u00a0A way to have Jarvis close to her on this most joyful of days because if she cannot have him with her then she'll wear the dress he gave her so long ago.</p>\n<p>Her hair is a riot of blossom filled curls left lose to spill down her back to her waist and beyond. \u00a0The jeweled comb sweeps it back and away from her face while Rhodey had placed small, delicate braids throughout the mass and helped her tuck the asphodel blossoms James had given her into the strands with infinite care.</p>\n<p>Hair down, wings and arc reactor uncovered, Toni goes to James as she is. \u00a0Goes to him without all of her masks.</p>\n<p>A girl, a woman, who had been more than half destroyed more than once over the years.</p>\n<p>A goddess who had slumbered unaware for decades but had still managed to somehow be half mad from the cradle.</p>\n<p>\u2018<em>This</em>,\u2019 Toni tells James silently, \u2018<em>is who I am, down below it all, past all of my armors.\u00a0\u00a0</em><em>This is what I give to you.</em>\u2019</p>\n<p>And James \u2026</p>\n<p>Standing there, feet bare and shadows curling at the edges of his being, James only smiles and holds out a hand.</p>\n<p>Eyes locked with his, Toni\u2019s tips unpainted lips up into a sweet smile, and reaches out to place her hand in his.</p>\n<p>He pulls her closer.</p>\n<p>Ever, <em> always</em>, closer.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The reception is loud and joyful even with such a small crowd. \u00a0Rogers disappears as soon as the ceremony is done but Toni can\u2019t, won\u2019t, focus on him.</p>\n<p>Toni dances with everyone more than once. \u00a0Spends song after song spinning around the grass with Rhodey or Pepper or Harley\u2019s hand in her own, with one of the bots\u2019 claws clasped carefully in hand. \u00a0She even dances with Thor who had been honored to tears at being asked to bless their handfasting.</p>\n<p>Toni just laughs and admits that James had excellent taste in terms of a priest.</p>\n<p>Who better to bless the joining of Life and Death than the god of fertility and hallowing?</p>\n<p>The ribbon that was used is one that Toni will cherish forever too because her boys, her bots, had made it for her and James themselves.</p>\n<p>And between every dance with the others James takes her into his arms and twirls her around the grass, eyes bright and vibrant, expression a glorious mixture of love and hunger.</p>\n<p>The ring she\u2019d added to his hand shines gold in the fading light as swarms of fireflies begin to softly glow. \u00a0The way he looks at the sliver she\u2019d taken from the Mark III, the first true Iron Queen armor, and reworked into a ring makes her heart warm all over again.</p>\n<p>When their fingers intertwine their rings line up perfectly, the band of shadows he\u2019d pressed into her skin warm and humming in time with his heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Toni moves with him across the dance floor, eyes locked, hearts beating in time, and swears she can touch infinity.</p>\n<p>With him at her side she actually wants to.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>That night, once the others have cleared out, James slides the sundress from her shoulders with reverent gentleness.</p>\n<p>And when he handles the aged fabric carefully, picks it up to hang it over a low hanging branch, she loves him all the more.</p>\n<p>He strips her until she\u2019s bare, left with only the flowers in her hair, the comb, and the golden vine crown, topped with rubies and sapphires shaped into rose buds, he\u2019d made for her.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wife</em>,\u201d James presses the word against the soft skin of her throat, the hollows of her shoulders, the swell of her breasts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Husband</em>,\u201d Toni whispers back later against his temple, the sharp cut of his jaw, the cut of his hips.</p>\n<p>Each time they say the words is a new whisper of worship.</p>\n<p>Two gods kneeling at their chosen alters.</p>\n<p>Eternity promised in a breath.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>When Thanos finally does come Toni meets him on the battlefield, head held high.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you, little girl,\u201d Thanos says, recognition heavy in his tone, something like possessiveness in his face, \u201c<em>Kore</em>. \u00a0The Stones whispered to me of you, lover of Death. \u00a0Queen of Life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersephone,\u201d Toni corrects him, \u201cor Toni Stark, they both mean the same thing really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what name you wear I know you. \u00a0And I know you are so very alone,\u201d Thanos taunts. \u00a0\u201cYou were abandoned if the rumors are true. And now here you are, no Death King at your side. \u00a0I will fix that for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Toni says with a blade sharp smile, \u201cthat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>And when she holds out a hand James reaches out of the shadows to meet her half way, eyes bright and cold as he steps from the dark and takes his place at her side.</p>\n<p>The kiss he presses against her knuckles and then against the inside of her wrist are gentle, loving, even as his face twists itself into a vicious snarl as he stares at Thanos.</p>\n<p>His eyes promise Death to the Mad Titan, to this would be usurper who covets what will never be his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wanted to taste Death for so long now. \u00a0Wanted to take it as your own.\u201d Toni tells Thanos easily, calmly. \u00a0\u201cWell now you\u2019re about to get your chance. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out the way you were hoping it would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because, Toni cannot help but think, what is a Mad Titan in the face of Life and Death themselves, united and whole and determined to never be parted?</p>\n<p>Thanos might wield the gauntlet but Toni and James know infinity in a way he will <em> never </em>touch.</p>\n<p>The water is warm and soothing as Toni floats in the middle of the pool sized bath. \u00a0The water ripples with movement but she doesn\u2019t bother to move.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d know James in the dark between worlds, deaf and blind to all around her.</p>\n<p>She can feel him in every breath she takes, in the flow of creation itself, in the pulse of his heartbeat, steady and strong, in the ring she still wears, the one that\u2019s been a part of her since the day he pressed it down and into her skin.</p>\n<p>Plus there\u2019s no way JARVIS or her plants would let anyone into her bath that didn\u2019t already have permission to be there.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe boy called,\u201d James tells her as he moves to her side, arm coming up to brace against her waist and head bending down to press a lingering kiss against the sensitive skin beneath her ear. \u00a0\u201cWanted to know when we\u2019d be home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Toni says as she lets him take her weight without ever opening her eyes, \u201cone of these days you and Harley are going to have to stop pretending like you don\u2019t like each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho says we\u2019re pretending?\u201d \u00a0James protests as he trails the fingers of his metal hand down the line of her throat, across the tops of her breasts and down to flick teasingly, at her navel and the ruby star that still hangs there. \u00a0\u201cTold you back when I first met him, kid\u2019s got fire. Not my fault that fire seems pretty focused on being a pain in my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s how he shows his affection,\u201d Toni reminds him yet again. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s why him and Butterfingers are thick as thieves. They\u2019re both filled with murder. \u00a0Next time there\u2019s a fight I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m just gonna throw those two at whoever comes our way. \u00a0That\u2019ll end things quicker than anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPetal,\u201d James groans, \u201cI\u2019ve told you not to say stuff like that. \u00a0It\u2019s a horrifying thought, those two teaming up. Bout as terrifying as when you and Rhodes get up to something. \u00a0I don\u2019t feel like having to snuff out another apocalypse anytime soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like I didn\u2019t catch you and Loki both throwing knives with those two not a few months ago when we got together for the conference.\u201d \u00a0Toni tells him without protesting his comment on her and Rhodey\u2019s shenanigans because they both know it\u2019s true even after all this time. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a leg to stand on, husband. \u00a0We both know you\u2019re nothing but a marshmallow for Harley and all the rest of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I am, am I?\u201d \u00a0James says, voice low with hunger as he pulls her around through the water until her legs wrap around his naked hips in a move long made second nature. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t know if I like that. You thinking I\u2019ve gone all soft. Maybe I should take some time and show you how <em> hard </em>I can still be. \u00a0What do you think about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna know what I think?\u201d Toni asks lowly as she finally opens her eyes, hands coming up to tug at his hair hard enough to make him hiss lowly as she stretches up to bite at his jaw line. \u00a0\u201cI think that was a terrible line. And I also think you\u2019ve got about an hour and a half before we touch down to make it up to me. So you\u2019d better get to work, Soldier.\u201d</p>\n<p>James laughs, low and rough and delighted, and boosts her up higher against him, hands cupping her ass firmly as he moves to lay her out against the side of the bath.</p>\n<p>Toni lets him move her, no long afraid of the water, no longer haunted by memories or the fear of being forcefully submerged.</p>\n<p>Not after so many years.</p>\n<p>Not when she knows that James, her love, her Death King, her <em> husband</em>, will always be there to help keep her afloat.</p>\n<p>When she\u2019s with him, wrapped in his arms, pressed against his skin with his heart beating fast and heavy beneath her palm, fear is a thing for other people.</p>\n<p>When she\u2019s with him there\u2019s only love.</p>\n<p>Always love.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d \u00a0Rhodey asks as he leans down to press a kiss against her temple even as he presses a fresh mug of coffee into her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh,\u201d Toni grimaces as she snuggles closer to his side, free hand coming up to tuck her thumb into the corner of his pants pocket as she sips at her personal ambrosia. \u00a0\u201cLike I say every time, I could do without all of the pageantry. It\u2019s still a little much, even for me. Which, you know, is saying something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rhodey says wryly, \u201cit\u2019s not like we\u2019re not used to it, baby girl. \u00a0We\u2019ve been doing this song and dance for how long now, the two of us? And that was before you and your boy toy outed yourselves to the world when you took down Thanos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Toni admits. \u00a0She\u2019d been born into the spotlight after all and had learned to play it to her advantage from a young age. \u00a0And Rhodey had been there with her every step of the way, just like he is now.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Rhodey says, \u201cit makes people happy, seeing us all together at the site. \u00a0And it\u2019s good for intergalactic relations. Thanos did a lot of damage to a lot of worlds before he got to us. \u00a0Damage that a lot of them are still healing from even now. So, you know, it\u2019s not all bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s right, Toni knows. \u00a0But that doesn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t rather be doing something else. \u00a0The rainforest she\u2019s been nurturing around the estate they keep near the Tartarus Montes range on Mars is much more interesting. \u00a0As are the advancements on FTL engines Rhodey and her have been throwing back and forth with Harley.</p>\n<p>But, as always, needs must. \u00a0There are some responsibilities that cannot be ignored no matter how boring or tedious or overdone Toni might find them.</p>\n<p>As always it helps to have Rhodey at her side.</p>\n<p>Together they stand there, basking in each other\u2019s warmth, as close as they\u2019ve always been.</p>\n<p>Between them is a love so solid and true that is has transcended time and space, has clawed its way through <em> divinity </em> itself, to lead them to where they are now.</p>\n<p>Two gods, one old and one newly awakened, Life and <em> Love </em>given form, staring out at the stars streaming along around them.</p>\n<p>Toni and Rhodey standing together against the slow crawl of time.</p>\n<p>As they were always meant to do.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s standing on the balcony of her and James\u2019 room in the now even more sprawling Compound, eyes closed and face tilted up towards the sky, when she hears soft, padded footsteps on the stone behind her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any regrets?\u201d \u00a0Harley\u2019s voice is soft and even when he comes up behind her, one lean, muscled arm coming up to wrap around her waist as he leans against her back, chin on top of her head.</p>\n<p>Toni just rolls her eyes and leans back into his hold because they both know how happy being so much taller than her makes him, even after all of these years.</p>\n<p>Even if it is, honestly, not that much of an achievement. \u00a0Most people, and all of their family in fact except for the bots, are taller than Toni.</p>\n<p>Hell Harley, tall for his age with the promise of a wiry build, hadn\u2019t been all that far off from her height when they first met. \u00a0The Spider-tot, who is far from an actual child these days even if Toni refuses to change her nicknames, had been taller than her from the get go.</p>\n<p>Even without her powers actively stretching her, sweet little Kamala had been too, much to her delight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Toni hums as she considers his question. \u00a0\u201cThere are things that, if I had the time back, I probably would have done differently, hindsight being what it is. \u00a0But I\u2019m happy, Harley. Even after all of these years, I\u2019m still so happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s true too.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the turn of a new century rapidly bearing down upon them, the world is so very different than it had been when everything had started, and Toni is still so achingly, gloriously <em> happy</em>.</p>\n<p>But she still has to ask him. \u00a0Still has to ask the same question that comes up between the two of them, between her and Rhodey and JARVIS and Kamala and the Spider-child at least once every new decade or so.</p>\n<p>Some old habits are, after all, the harder to shake than others.</p>\n<p>And Toni will always be <em> terrified </em>of hurting those she loves.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you, Sprocket?\u201d \u00a0Toni asks softly. \u201cYou fine with the life you have now? \u00a0With what,\u201d she stops, clears her throat slightly and then forces herself to press forward, \u201cwith what being a part of my family ended up doing to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mechanic</em>,\u201d Harley practically whines like he always does, body slumping down around her, \u201cwe\u2019ve been through this. \u00a0How many times do I gotta tell you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust once more,\u201d Toni tells him just like she always does.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he huffs, the perpetual child when they\u2019re together like this, years and maturity melting away as if they\u2019d never existed. \u00a0Toni loves him all the more for it, for the vulnerability and sincerity he shows to her in exchange for her own. \u201cI\u2019m happy with who and what I am now. \u00a0With not aging, with being the Iron Man beside your Iron Queen. With getting to stay with you and the others and watching the universe grow. Have been ever since you blessed me and after we realized what was happening. \u00a0So stop worrying. I\u2019m <em> happy</em>, Toni. \u00a0We all are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Toni tells him softly as she brings a hand up to tug at his messy hair, short nails scratching lightly at the closely buzzed underside. \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Much like with Rhodey, the blessing she\u2019d given Harley had eventually changed him. \u00a0Their crawl towards divinity had been a process much slower than James\u2019 abrupt ascension as each of them had slowly grown into the aspects that suited them best.</p>\n<p>Turns out that that connection between the two of them actually ran a lot deeper than they\u2019d ever thought.</p>\n<p>Turns out that nature truly does abhor a vacuum and the blessing of Life, and far more rarely Death, are the perfect bits of tinder for the sparks of divinity to catch flame in.</p>\n<p>And in Harley, like Kamala and the Spider-baby, that spark had flared bright and hard.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d come out of the other side of his awakening stronger than before and with an aspect that had made James laugh and laugh.</p>\n<p><em> Vengeance </em>suited Harley almost disturbingly well after all.</p>\n<p>Almost as well as <em> Mercy </em>suited Toni\u2019s favorite Spider in the end.</p>\n<p>Toni had wrestled with the guilt of changing those she\u2019d given her favor to beyond the initial blessing for a long time. \u00a0A blessing and immortality are one thing to agree to, having true divinity and an aspect pressed onto your shoulders are another.</p>\n<p>She still feels the guilt of it in burst and stops, but with their reassurances she\u2019s mostly found peace with what has happened.</p>\n<p>Because, fading but stubborn guilt aside, if it means Toni doesn\u2019t have to lose Harley or Kamala or her favorite little Spider to the slow decay of time, then she\u2019s more than fine with what had happened.</p>\n<p>If it means she gets to keep so much of her family, gets to hold them close and watch them flourish, and she will never not be grateful for that.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you with me?\u201d \u00a0Toni whispers, a long held tradition that she will never part with.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways, Miss,\u201d JARVIS whispers in her ear as the air to her right shimmers just a bit. \u00a0A haze that grows thicker, more solid with each year that passes. A decade more of soaking up her divine aura and Toni\u2019s sure she\u2019ll finally be able to hold him just like she\u2019s always wanted to. \u00a0She could quicken the process of course but JARVIS is, for once, content to have things happen more \u2026 organically. \u201cI am with you now, and always. From my first day until my last.\u201d</p>\n<p>James\u2019 grip on her left hand tightens just a bit then in a reassuring squeeze as Rhodey steps up to stand on her right.</p>\n<p>The doors of the ship open and together the three of them step out into the light and a wall of sound as the crowd, a mix of humans, Aesir, and others, begins to roar.</p>\n<p>The gathering honestly seems bigger each time they come back to this place, to where Toni and James had stood together with the others at their back against Thanos so very long ago.</p>\n<p>Toni, hair up, wings and arc reactor covered, flowers blossoming to life beneath her every step and the crown that James had given her on their wedding day firmly in place, keeps her head up and a smile fixed firmly in place.</p>\n<p>Beside her, shadows ebbing and flowing around him and expression far more stoic but still soft, James does the same.</p>\n<p>Rhodey, his hand coming up to twine with her free one, laughs, bright and cheerful and so very loved as he raises his free hand up to wave at the people.</p>\n<p>Their divinity, their natures, are no secret these days. \u00a0Can\u2019t be, not after all that\u2019s passed.</p>\n<p>Here, in this future they built together, Toni no longer has to hide so much of herself.</p>\n<p>Across the way she sees the others already gathered beneath the sprawling boughs of the black barked yew tree with its spindly, gnarled branches and its stark white leaves, that forever marks Thanos\u2019 final resting place.</p>\n<p>Vision, as unchanging as ever, floats forwards to meet them, bending down to press a soft kiss against the arc of her cheek. \u00a0She\u2019s missed him these past few months he\u2019s spent out on another one of his regular trips out to explore and learn.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Rogers lingers beneath the tree, time not yet erasing the pain and distrust that still lingers between the two of them even if he and James have steadily rebuilt the bridges between them over the years.</p>\n<p>Toni\u2019s not angry at Rogers anymore, can\u2019t be with how much joy James alone brings her daily, but she knows that there will never be a closeness between the two of them.</p>\n<p>Some things, once broken, can never be repaired.</p>\n<p>Some trusts, once shattered, can never be regained.</p>\n<p>But Rogers has also found his own sort of peace these days so perhaps it\u2019s all worked out for the most part.</p>\n<p>Nomad, the warrior god of the lost, is a much loved figure after all, far more adored than Captain America had ever been.</p>\n<p>Rhodey kisses her temple again and lets her go, moving towards Thor and Loki and the tell tale flash of blonde hair just behind the two that she <em> knows </em>is his real target.</p>\n<p>They really are a <em> marvelous </em>couple.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a irritated shout, the familiar sound of a web being shot, and then Kamala\u2019s joyful yell. \u00a0Beside her James groans just a bit in exasperation but she knows it\u2019s for show.</p>\n<p>Kamala, bright eyed, cheerful, and a glowing bastion of <em> Justice</em>, had been his find after all.</p>\n<p>Looking around at the gathering before her, the smile that breaks across Toni\u2019s face is bright and happy and, most of all, <em> real</em>.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d James whispers to her once the speeches are done, hands spanning her waist as they stand beneath the bows of the yew tree, the cheers of the crowd fading to a dull roar around them. \u00a0\u201cGot love etched into my bones for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Toni tells him as she presses up to meet his kiss half way. \u00a0\u201cWith all that I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>The crowd roars with renewed frenzy but Toni doesn\u2019t hear them.</p>\n<p>All she can focus on is James.</p>\n<p>Because, just like every other time he kisses her, the rest of the world fades away until it\u2019s only the two of them.</p>\n<p>Infinity in a kiss.</p>\n<p>~~~</p>\n<p>The crowds and celebrations left behind them once again, her family pressing in on her with their warmth and their love, Toni takes a moment to just <em> breathe</em>.</p>\n<p>Time had changed so much for the world, for Toni and her family, for humanity specifically and the universe as a whole.</p>\n<p>Some faces had faded, time eating away at mortality as it always does, and others had stayed the same, blessings of Life and occasionally of Death and newly sparked divinity keeping them as they were.</p>\n<p>It had truly been an accident. \u00a0Toni had only been acting selfishly, unwilling to let more of her family slip away from her than necessary. \u00a0But then, in time, the side effect of such a potent blessing had become apparent and what had once been three, became four, and then five and then six, until finally a new pantheon had risen from the ashes of the old.</p>\n<p>And during all of that the world had expanded at a rapid pace, the stars no longer unreachable, humanity no longer confined to a single planet.</p>\n<p>A planet that Toni, with the other\u2019s help and encouragement, had turned every ounce of Life and Spring within her towards healing as best she could once Thanos had been removed from the board.</p>\n<p>It had been hard, those first few decades of change and adjustment for the world, but it had been worth it, is still worth it.</p>\n<p>They have achieved so much together, have turned life for so many towards the better, and even with all of that progress they keep striving ever forward.</p>\n<p>There are even more golden days before them, Toni knows there are.</p>\n<p>She, <em> they</em>, will build them, bit by bit.</p>\n<p>Because with Toni and James at the helm, with Rhodey and JARVIS ever at her sides, with the <em> family </em>they have built piece by piece over the years, they will make sure that this pantheon is better than the last.</p>\n<p>Kinder in all of the ways that matter.</p>\n<p>Stronger in all of the ways it should be.</p>\n<p>Worthy of all that they have been given and all they have fought for.</p>\n<p>Because unlike the last pantheon, unlike Zeus\u2019 strangle hold on god and man alike, Toni and the gods that have risen to stand with her through the eternity to come, all have the same driving force behind them.</p>\n<p><em> Love</em>.</p>\n<p>And, in the end, Toni knows that will make all the difference.</p>"
