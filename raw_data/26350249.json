  "text": "<p>\n<span>Kiyoomi is already regretting inviting his teammates into his home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s been roughly twelve minutes since they walked in the door and the mistake is glaring. Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t watch this game tape alone in the first place.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It started a week and a half ago when Coach Foster read some article about group analysis being superior to individual review and it ended with a mandate for the whole team to group up to watch a recent Adlers v. Red Falcons game.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kiyoomi supposes this is better than the elevation training idea the coach was obsessed with during conditioning camp. He\u2019s still convinced that the mountain cold left him with nerve damage in his pinky toe, even though the trainers assured Kiyoomi there\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSakusa-san, do you want one of my sodas?!\u201d Hinata asks loudly from Sakusa\u2019s armchair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As if Bokuto\u2019s unending energy hadn\u2019t been enough for one team... Kiyoomi can feel a headache forming between his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Please\u2026 please don\u2019t spill,</span>\n</em>\n<span> he thinks to himself as he watches the bottle balance precariously between the wing spiker's knees, trying and failing to keep his brow from pinching into a scowl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he replies.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAww, you sure, \u2018Kusa? It\u2019s melon flavor!\u201d Bokuto says, horrifically waving his own bottle over his head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, Omi-kun. Dontcha want somethin\u2019 sweet?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then there\u2019s him. Miya Atsumu is slouched into the corner of his couch, arms spread out over the back of it like he owns the place. His cocky, heavy-lidded gaze nearly makes Kiyoomi roll his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll get the tape cued up,\u201d he says instead, ignoring them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The thing is, there weren\u2019t really any better venue options for this than Kiyoomi\u2019s apartment. Hinata is still living out of a hotel. Atsumu\u2019s place is apparently a small studio picked more for location than size. Bokuto apparently had the space and was willing to host, but\u2026 Kiyoomi\u2019s seen the way he lives on the road. To continue playing on the same side of the net as Bokuto, it is absolutely essential that Kiyoomi never witness the surely horrific state of his home. Bokuto\u2019s boyfriend seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but there\u2019s only so much Akaashi can do for Bokuto\u2019s apartment when he spends most of his time in Tokyo.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, in picking the least of a series of extreme evils, Kiyoomi invited his teammates to his own apartment. In all honesty, he regretted it the moment it left his mouth. He regrets it now. He\u2019s sure he\u2019ll continue to regret it throughout the night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kiyoomi ends up being right in ways he never could have predicted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu honestly agrees with Sakusa that this whole group tape watching exercise is pretty futile, which is why he already watched it earlier in the afternoon. With Hinata and Bokuto in the same room, there\u2019s no way anyone could focus enough to break down the opposition\u2019s receive formations. Even so, he\u2019s been vocally supportive of the whole group watch party concept just for the opportunity to see Sakusa squirm.</p>\n<p>His current objective is less centered around match footage and more focused on seeing how many times he can make Sakusa look like he\u2019s just stepped in gum. Atsumu knows it\u2019s not exactly mature, but hey, he\u2019s a twin. Whenever Osamu isn\u2019t around, he has to find a way to fulfill his innate need to good-naturedly torture someone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sakusa is <em> so </em>easy to torment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Speaking of the devil, Atsumu\u2019s phone buzzes on the arm of the sofa, flashing Osamu\u2019s name over an extremely unflattering picture of his face. He stands up to take the call, dodging around Hinata, who just hopped up from the couch singing some ditty about going to the bathroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hinata acts like a twelve-year-old off the court but damn it if Atsumu doesn\u2019t find it endearing as hell. He ruffles bright ginger hair as he heads down the hallway behind him and picks up the call.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSup, \u2018Samu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Just got off the phone with Ma\u2019. She\u2019s gettin\u2019 rid of a few things and needs some help movin\u2019 things. I\u2019d help but I\u2019m up\u2019n Tokyo workin\u2019 on the new store \u2018til the end of next week\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They chat about logistics for a minute, Atsumu confirming that he\u2019ll have time to swing by home sometime in the next day or two. When he hangs up, Atsumu realizes that he has to take a leak as well but, judging by the singing still coming from the bathroom in the hall, it\u2019s occupied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu <em> could </em> wait, but he glances at the door that must lead to the bedroom. This is a nice place; Sakusa surely has an ensuite, he thinks to himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d be lying if a desire to see the neat-freak\u2019s bedroom isn\u2019t also at play here, but he\u2019d never admit it out loud. He wonders if Sakusa uses plastic sheets that can be sterilized each morning. The thought makes him chuckle to himself.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Carefully, Atsumu cracks the door open, leaning to look inside. There\u2019s nothing particularly weird about the room, to Atsumu\u2019s deep disappointment. It\u2019s nice, though: lots of cast iron and soft greys with wood accents. There\u2019s even a fleece throw blanket casually draped over a metal accent chair in the corner with a potted plant on the seat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu sniggers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t surprising considering the size and furnishings in the main areas of the apartment, but this seals Atsumu\u2019s belief that Sakusa <em> absolutely </em>comes from money. A little rich kid, who\u2019d have thought?</p>\n<p>Atsumu slides quickly and quietly into the room and towards the open bathroom door. He makes it to the doorway, pleased at his successful territory breach, and then Atsumu freezes.</p>\n<p>Feet rooted to the ground. Jaw dropped. No brain activity. <em> Frozen</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange, the way the world immediately tips sideways and Atsumu forgets where he is as he takes in black leather. There\u2019s <em> black leather </em> hanging from a curtain rod\u2014from <em> Sakusa\u2019s curtain rod</em>. Atsumu snaps back into spacetime.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The biggest item looks like some sort of harness, with buckles and silver rings. Next to it is something that Atsumu can definitely identify: thick leather cuffs, four of them, with a series of chains delicately draped beside them. Finally, small enough that Astumu doesn\u2019t notice it until he staggeringly <em> does</em>, is a ball gag. The ones that Atsumu has seen before, in the margins of porn sites or on the front of smutty manga, always feature a bright red ball. This one is all black.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Sakusa has a sex toy aesthetic</em>, some voice in the back of his head muses as the rest of his brain goes into a momentary nuclear meltdown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s already back at the bedroom door by the time that his brain comes back on line. He shuts the door, nearly body-slamming Hinata when he turns around.</p>\n<p>\u201cUwah!\u201d the redhead exclaims. \u201cAh! Atsumu-san! Were you waiting to use the bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Atsumu says, his voice coming out pitchy and strained.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu spends the rest of the evening looking anywhere <em> but </em> at Sakusa. He doesn\u2019t watch the game, either. He doesn\u2019t do much of <em> anything </em> except blink repeatedly at the wall and try to figure out how he\u2019s going to live with the knowledge that Sakusa is into kinky sex. Sakusa can <em> never </em> find out that he knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never even <em> thought </em> of Sakusa as a sexual being before today. Atsumu always figured physical intimacy would be beneath him, base and disgusting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu is so wrapped up in his thoughts that it takes Bokuto waving a hand in front of his face to snap back to the present.</p>\n<p>\u201cEyyyy, Tsum-Tsum! We\u2019re headed out. You coming to the station with us?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hinata\u2019s putting on his coat in the genkan and Sakusa is sitting in one of the armchairs, focused on his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I actually drove,\u201d Atsumu says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, then,\u201d Bokuto says, heading over to the genkan to put his shoes on. \u201cSee you at practice!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Tsumu-san!\u201d Hinata waves around Bokuto\u2019s big body as they head out the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu stands up and realizes he\u2019s made a fatal error as soon as the door clicks shut. <em> Why didn\u2019t he say he\u2019d walk down with them?! </em> Now he\u2019s alone, in an apartment with Sakusa\u2014Sakusa and his leather harnesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nearly chokes on his own spit, rushing towards the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still have a few drinks in the fridge. I won\u2019t drink them so please take them with you,\u201d Sakusa says, grabbing the clicker to flip the TV over to the news.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Atsumu says and abruptly switches directions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grabs his two remaining peach teas up and puts them in the convenience store bag he brought them in. He rushes back into the living room. He doesn\u2019t quite get to his coat on the hook by the door before Sakusa speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Miya\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw the sex stuff in your bathroom,\u201d Atsumu violently blurts against his will.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time stretches out again, eternal, unending\u2026 the void at the beginning and end of all things coming to claim Atsumu as he stands in his borrowed house slippers by Sakusa\u2019s door. There\u2019s a ringing in his ears, or perhaps it\u2019s the laughter of some vengeful god.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t outwardly change. His eyes feel like they\u2019re drilling holes in Atsumu\u2019s head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sex stuff. It\u2019s bondage gear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Ok then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi gets a series of texts later that night. He\u2019s just changing into a pair of clean boxer briefs and a white tee shirt in preparation for bed when his phone buzzes on the side table.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>From:</b> Miya Atsumu<br>\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean it\u2019s not sex stuff? I thought bondage gear was sex stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should probably just ignore the text, but delicacy has never been Kiyoomi\u2019s strong suit.</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Miya Atsumu<br>\n&gt;&gt; It can be used in sexual play but BDSM isn\u2019t inherently sexual. Do your own research Miya.</p>\n<p>Still, Kiyoomi would hate for Atsumu to google some porn site and think he was doing research. Considering the horrors that could be heralded by a free-range Atsumu, Kiyoomi decides to pull up a BDSM 101 article from a trusted source and send the link.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He then decisively turns his phone to <em> do-not-disturb </em> and turns off the lights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t have practice the next day, so by mid morning Atsumu has read through the link that Sakusa sent, as well as three or four of the pages that were hyperlinked in it. As a free-wheeling bisexual who\u2019s never had trouble finding a partner, Atsumu considers himself pretty experienced. He\u2019s had a girl ask him to smack her on the ass before, and he had a short lived boyfriend who liked to have his wrists held down when they fucked. Even so, he\u2019s always had pretty vanilla tastes, he supposes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two bodies touching each other has always been pretty much enough to get Atsumu going, either in person or on video.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, he really just opens the link out of some morbid curiosity. He hadn\u2019t even really meant to send that text, but it had just been\u2026 eating at him. It may have been a tactical error because, no matter his reasons, Atsumu didn\u2019t expect to be <em> fascinated</em>. He had no idea BDSM was so complex. He clicks a link to something called <em> shibari </em> and his eyes go comically wide.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Huh. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still having trouble wrapping his head around the idea of this not being a sex thing, though. Especially as he hops in the shower and finds his hand wrapped around his cock, one forearm braced against the tile. The scalding water pounds down on his back as images of rope and kneeling figures run through his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu pants through his open mouth, fingertips pressed into the wall as his pace speeds up against his will. He thinks about studded collars and an ass so red you need to put lotion on it when you\u2019re done. He thinks about a pale chest wrapped in a clean, black, leather harness.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMmnf-fuck!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>His strangled curse is drowned out by the sound of water against porcelain, and the evidence of Atsumu\u2019s sudden obsession disappears down the drain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>About fifteen minutes later, Atsumu is sitting in his kitchen in a pair of sweats with his towel around his neck, perusing an article on different types of doms and subs. Once again he finds his fingers flying over his phone keyboard before he can think better of it.</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt;Omi r ya a dom or a sub?</p>\n<p>Atsumu checks the article again, realizing he forgot one of the main ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt;Or a switch?</p>\n<p>Anyone else would probably tell Atsumu to fuck off, but for all his derision, Sakusa is rarely anything but brutally truthful when asked a direct question. Sure enough, only five minutes later his phone dings.</p>\n<p><b>From: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt;I primarily dom. Stop texting me about this or I\u2019ll tell your mother you entered someone\u2019s bedroom without asking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few prickles of sweat break out on Atsumu\u2019s brow as he\u2019s forced to imagine the hell and fury his mother would bring down upon him for being so rude.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, he\u2019ll have to continue doing any more research on his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi should have known better than to believe that would be the end of it. Unfortunately, he wouldn\u2019t even get through the end of the week before he\u2019s faced with further consequences of trusting his teammates to respect basic boundaries. <em> He\u2019d just needed to sanitize and oil the leather</em>. It needed twenty-four hours to dry. He hadn\u2019t <em> planned </em> for anyone to rudely enter his ensuite bathroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn Miya and his nosiness.</p>\n<p>On Friday they have morning practice followed by a few hours of individual skills training. Kiyoomi heads to the locker rooms after most of the veterans have already left the courts. Normally Bokuto and Hinata would have been fixtures in the group that stayed late, but the team had three days off and the pair wanted to make a weekend trip to Tokyo, so there were only a handful of players still practicing quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi showers and then spreads his towel out on a bench to finish getting dressed. He\u2019s just about done packing his bag when Atsumu himself walks into the otherwise empty locker room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi-Omi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi isn\u2019t sure when he stooped pushing back on the nickname. Once Bokuto picked it up, resistance became pretty much futile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya,\u201d he responds with the extra cool warning he\u2019s been using all week.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beyond his texts, Atsumu hasn\u2019t mentioned his discovery of Kiyoomi\u2019s hobby in person so far. He began to hope that it would fade into irrelevance in Atsumu\u2019s mind as he loses interest or the novelty of the discovery fades. That hope is shattered as Atsumu turns towards Kiyoomi, stripping his sweat-stained practice shirt off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Omi,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI have another question \u2018bout the BDSM thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I told you to stop talking about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa told me to stop <em> textin\u2019 </em> ya about it,\u201d he says, with the conviction of someone who played the <em> i\u2019m-not-touching-you </em>game far too much as a child.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t gratify it with a response, but Atsumu is predictably undeterred.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, I think I wanna try it,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Kiyoomi deadpans as he zips his bag up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd since yer the only person I know who does it, I think we should do it together,\u201d he finishes.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi freezes for just a moment and then slowly raises his head to level a black stare at the setter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, decisively, incontestably.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?!\u201d Atsumu asks, head tilted to the side in confusion like he couldn\u2019t possibly imagine why Kiyoomi wouldn\u2019t want to. Like there aren\u2019t millions of obvious reasons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu puts his hands on his hips as he stands there in just his practice shorts. His wide shoulders, bleach-blonde hair, and heavy, cocksure eyes remind Kiyoomi how well he\u2019d fit in an American fraternity. Which is only one of the <em> many </em> reasons, honestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no interest in being at the mercy of an overconfident, wannabe-dom who thinks it would be fun to live out some 50 Shades of Grey fantasy. Just find a partner on one of the dating apps you assuredly use who\u2019s willing to have mildly rough sex with you,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be difficult for you to find a volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p>He then hikes his bag up onto his shoulder and gets ready to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarsh, Omi-Omi!\u201d Atsumu says, clutching his chest dramatically. \u201cBut I\u2019m not askin\u2019 ya to let me dom you. One of the websites said it\u2019s good to try subbing first, at least once or twice so ya know what it feels like, and since ya said you dom I thought it might work perfectly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi hesitates for just a moment. He hadn\u2019t expected that\u2014Atsumu being interested in subbing\u2014nor had he expected him to have any sort of fleshed-out thought process behind it. Apparently he <em> has </em>been reading. Still\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cStill no,\u201d Kiyoomi says and then heads right out the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu will not be deterred so easily. He can\u2019t really blame Sakusa for making assumptions about his intentions and seriousness, so he\u2019ll just have to prove him wrong. He tries again next time they\u2019re in the locker room alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi-kun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sakusa starts, which isn\u2019t the best sign.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was gonna <em> say </em> yet,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI coulda meant to talk to ya about a new counter attack idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa raises one devastating brow, sending his distinct twin moles towards his hairline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but-\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa sighs deeply through his mask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just really think ya should give me a shot with the whole sub thing,\u201d Atsumu says, stretching on a rolled out yoga mat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can create a Fetlife profile and look for a dom there like everyone else,\u201d Sakusa says dismissively.</p>\n<p>Atsumu scrunches his nose up in disgust at the idea. He tucks his knees up against his chest and tries not to visibly pout.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did that! All the profiles are so weird an\u2019 intense. I don\u2019t want to try stuff like this with a total stranger. What if they\u2019re a weirdo? What if someone recognizes me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not famous, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a public figure!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts, extremely rudely in Atsumu\u2019s opinion. They\u2019re on <em> TV\u2014</em>that\u2019s at least famous-<em>ish</em>. Sakusa zips up his MSBY jacket with finality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Miya. If you\u2019re genuinely interested,\u201d he says, with a notable amount of skepticism. \u201cI\u2019ll reach out through my network and see if anyone in the area is willing to take on someone who just wants to try kink out. I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up and I won\u2019t make any promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu frowns again, running his hand through his hair. It could be better than a random profile on the internet, but it doesn\u2019t make him feel good to think about. Sure the articles and porn got him going, but whenever he\u2019s been alone, it\u2019s always been Sakusa\u2019s impassive face looking down on him. He shivers and tries not to let it show on his face. He\u2019s imprinted on Sakusa, like a kinky baby duckling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em> Omi-kun-</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s out the door again. Atsumu tries to hop up to go after him, but standing up out of a stretch gives him a wicked thigh cramp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOw, ow, ow!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>He flops down onto the mat. Maybe he really should give up on this whole thing. On the other hand\u2026 giving up really isn\u2019t in his nature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi sits at his kitchen table with his laptop in front of him, perusing an email from a man that had been recommended to him as a potential sub. For a few years now, Kiyoomi has been part of a closed, online group of doms. They primarily discuss techniques, gear, and the community in general. The group is also a great resource for connecting with other people in the community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only been a few months since Kiyoomi moved to Osaka to join the Black Jackals after graduating university. He\u2019s met up with different subs twice since his arrival. While Kiyoomi prefers to be nonexclusive and uncommitted, he likes to be able to develop an ongoing relationship with his subs. The few he\u2019s been able to do so with in the past have produced the most satisfying experiences. There\u2019s only so much you can do to a person without an existing bond of trust and experience.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, neither of the subs he\u2019s met in Osaka have been a good match. While the first was a decent fit when it came to shared interests, he spent most of their scene, for lack of a better word, <em> wailing</em>. Kiyoomi found the sound\u2026 grating. Plus, it made it extremely difficult to tell what actually hit his buttons when he <em> started </em> at a ten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second, whose cleanup Atsumu unfortunately stumbled upon, was better, but he overstayed his welcome a bit by asking to sleep over, which Kiyoomi respectfully declined. That alone might not have disqualified him from a second scene, but he was also\u2026 tiny, frankly. He probably stood at 165cm tops and looked like a stiff wind could blow him over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi\u2019s self-aware enough to know that a lot of the pleasure and satisfaction he gains from domming is controlling something, a person, that otherwise couldn\u2019t necessarily be controlled. He likes his subs strong, and vital. He likes to see their muscles bunch up under their skin as they fight Kiyoomi\u2019s carefully tied knots, as they stop themselves from pushing him away, as they bow to the dom\u2019s power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone has preferences, and it seems like this newest candidate at least fits that one as Kiyoomi reads <em> weight lifting </em> as one of the sub\u2019s hobbies in the endearing \u2018about me\u2019 section he put at the top of his interests checklist. Unfortunately, the positives pretty much end there. Kiyoomi sighs as he reads through the rest: heavy into roleplaying and passionate about ongoing master/slave play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi likes to keep his play behind closed doors. The idea of texting someone what they\u2019re supposed to wear or eat sounds like hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He types up a thank you and politely declines the offer to meet up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that done, Kiyoomi considers his words to Atsumu the day before about connecting him to a local dom. He knows there are at least a couple doms in his group in the greater Osaka area. Some of them would probably even like the idea of \u2018training\u2019 a new sub, so to speak. That\u2019s definitely an area of interest for many doms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet, this group has been the only one Kiyoomi\u2019s found that boasts a mature, almost professional culture. He\u2019d absolutely loathe to end up kicked out because he set someone up with the trainwreck that Atsumu is guaranteed to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi steeples his fingers in front of his face, chin resting on the pads of his thumbs. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be the worst idea to take Atsumu on just for one session. It\u2019s not like he has anyone to work with right now, and inflicting Atsumu on others seems cruel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes suddenly widen in horror and he snaps his laptop shut.</p>\n<p>If Kiyoomi\u2019s having ideas that stupid, he\u2019d better go find a book or some other way to better himself as a human being. That train of thought is too dangerous to take.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t end.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi-kun, is this a good source of info?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A phone is shoved in Kiyoomi\u2019s face and he\u2019s hit with images of various implements of impact play and their respective effects and pain levels. He quickly glances around the locker room, which has only just started filling up before practice. He then levels a baleful glare at Atsumu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The setter just waits expectantly. Banning Atsumu from texting him about BDSM may have backfired, if it results in it continuously coming up in the locker room. Not wanting Atsumu to ask again, Kiyoomi looks at the graphic as quickly as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems accurate enough,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs through his mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Omi-Omi,\u201d Atsumu says and begins to walk away. He looks over his shoulder, smirking. \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything ya need to double check, though. I\u2019d be willin\u2019 ta selflessly volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, hitting Atsumu sounds pretty good right now. Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes pinch around the edges as he resists dissociating into the void.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, as Kiyoomi drives home, he finally admits that Atsumu hasn\u2019t acted exactly like Kiyoomi had expected him to when he initially showed interest. He didn\u2019t even expect the other man to be interested in subbing, let alone show evidence of doing real research.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi pulls into his parking spot and turns the engine off but doesn\u2019t get out of the car. He keeps his hands on the steering wheel as his eyes drill into the cement walls of the underground garage. He clenches his jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to dom for <em> Miya Atsumu </em>.</p>\n<p><em> You don\u2019t have to. In fact you really, really shouldn\u2019t, </em>a voice in his head counters.</p>\n<p>But somewhere deep down, the decision has already been made. It was probably made the moment that Kiyoomi came up with a reason not to send him off to another dom. He rests his forehead against his steering wheel and tries not to bang his skull against it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the next week this whole situation has started to become a <em> problem </em> for Atsumu, too. Clearly Sakusa\u2019s recently been wishing that Osamu ate his twin in the womb, but it\u2019s not like Atsumu hasn\u2019t been suffering himself. He can\u2019t stop looking at Sakusa\u2019s freakishly long fingers and keeps getting dry mouth when the spiker puts his mask on because he can\u2019t stop thinking about whether or not he wears it in the bedroom. So, who\u2019s <em> really </em> at fault for their predicament here?\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have a road trip and Atsumu decides to let it go for now, see if it\u2019s just a passing fascination. He\u2019s not going to bug Sakusa and he\u2019s going to avoid thinking about whips and chains.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feverish, Tsum-Tsum? You sure have been taking a lot of showers!\u201d Bokuto, his current road roommate, says when Atsumu exits the bathroom, towel around his waist for the fifth time in two days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026 not going great.</p>\n<p>Atsumu blames the leather jacket that Sakusa wore to the yakiniku place after their win the first night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily he\u2019s spared from having to answer the question by Bokuto\u2019s phone ringing. He picks up quickly, pressing the device to his face.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cKeiiiiji!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Aw, Atsumu\u2019s going to get cavities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, through the week, Atsumu manages to mildly keep it together, at least until they head to an izakaya on the final night of the trip. They won out the trip series, so the team is lively and well on their way to tipsy by the time their food arrives. Somehow, Atsumu has ended up next to the man himself, Sakusa wedged in the corner so he can retreat towards the wall as soon as he finishes eating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the night evolves\u2014or devolves, more accurately\u2014Atsumu and Sakusa end up chatting. There are two topics that consistently suppress the antagonism between them: volleyball and judging others. Today it\u2019s the drunken antics of their teammates.</p>\n<p>Eventually that topic burns out and there\u2019s a moment of silence. Nobody is paying attention to them in the corner. Sakusa is sitting up against the wall, mask back on. Atsumu\u2019s not even looking at him when he next speaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya, are you still interested in experimenting with subbing?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lot of feelings hit Atsumu at once. First he perks up, and then flushes as he realizes they\u2019re at a restaurant with their teammates. A quick glance around confirms nobody is paying attention to them. Most of the team has shifted down towards the end of the table to watch Hinata try to construct a card tower out of oyster shells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu turns back to Sakusa, blurting out a, \u201cY-yeah!\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he remembers the last thing Sakusa told him, about looking for someone in his community to dom Atsumu, and wilts a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I still don\u2019t wanna do it with a stranger. Sorry if I wasted your time talkin\u2019 to your\u2026 people,\u201d Atsumu says, looking away from Sakusa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I decided that was a bad idea. Sending you to someone else would definitely end up hurting my reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s head whips around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed ta mean?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa continues as if Astumu hasn\u2019t spoken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll do <em> one </em> scene with you, if only to prove you\u2019re not cut out for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s really rude\u2014wait, <em> what</em>\u2014you will?!\u201d</p>\n<p>The dark haired man isn\u2019t meeting Atsumu\u2019s eyes; he seems to be staring off into the distance, maybe counting the number of beer posters on the izakaya wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ll need you to send me the results of an up to date STI screening. I\u2019ll send you a kink checklist to fill out later. Anything you\u2019re not sure about you can leave blank. I\u2019ll also send you mine for reference,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if what you pick is sexual in nature, but know that I don\u2019t get sexually involved with my new subs during scenes.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a ringing in Atsumu\u2019s ears. It\u2019s a lot to take in, so he focuses on the last part.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean? How can I pick something sexual if you don\u2019t get <em> sexually involved </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile the play might involve you climaxing, I won\u2019t fuck you and I won\u2019t orgasm during the scene,\u201d Sakusa says bluntly, making Atsumu flush up to his ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright, I get it,\u201d Atsumu says, voice on the edge of cracking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can discuss timing once we\u2019re back in Osaka,\u201d Sakusa barrels on. \u201cNow, can you let me out of the booth? I\u2019m going back to the hotel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is frozen. He bites his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cI.. um... can you give me a minute?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya,\u201d Sakusa says, warning in his voice. \u201cMove.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Atsumu says, face burning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa pauses, looking down, and finally realizes his\u2026 <em> issue</em>. Atsumu pulls a jacket over his lap as Sakusa levels him with a deeply unimpressed stare.</p>\n<p>Atsumu should probably be embarrassed about the fact that the expression only makes the problem worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything moves very quickly after that. A quick doctor\u2019s visit, one chaotic night googling kinks, and an embarrassing email later, Atsumu is heading directly to Sakusa\u2019s apartment after practice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is Atsumu\u2019s first time in Sakusa\u2019s car. He\u2019s not surprised by the immaculate interior. He <em> is </em> surprised by the fact that Sakusa owns driving gloves, although in retrospect he probably should have expected it.</p>\n<p>Who even is this guy? And why does every little weird thing about him make Atsumu so hot?</p>\n<p>\u201cSo.\u201d Sakusa\u2019s fingers tighten on the wheel, black leather squeaking. \u201cYou filled out the list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything in particular you like?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Too much to fit into one round. </em> Atsumu swallows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course there is, Omi-kun. There were a bajillion things on that list.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pops his phone out of its case, folded paper tucked neatly away inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good. You brought it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu crinkles the paper in his hands, folding and unfolding one of the corners as he stares at it, his emphatic <em> yes </em> and <em> no </em>\u2019s printed in blue next to each kink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to go over it when we get to my apartment?\u201d Sakusa asks. \u201cOr do you already know what you\u2019d like to try?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh, well. A lot of the bondage stuff sounded cool, but I don\u2019t know enough specifics to ask for anythin\u2019 special,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cAnd\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sakusa prompts after several seconds of silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cUghhh, Omi, do ya ever get used to sayin\u2019 this stuff out loud? Shit\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu isn\u2019t looking at him, but he can feel Sakusa\u2019s eyes roll.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t even say it, you probably shouldn\u2019t be participating in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Can I write it down instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Atsumu whines. His voice most certainly does not crack when he mutters, \u201cOverstim.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sees Sakusa raise an eyebrow out of his peripheral vision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? For your first time? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shrugs, \u201cS\u2019just more of the good stuff, right? Call me crazy, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014but,\u201d Atsumu slaps his arm, \u201cmore orgasms are never a bad thing, the way I see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Well, as long as you understand what you\u2019re getting into. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re interested in bondage, because I probably would\u2019ve needed to tie you up for this anyway,\u201d Sakusa says.</p>\n<p>His voice is bored, like they\u2019re discussing the weather instead of <em> tying Atsumu up.</em>\u00a0It gets Atsumu hotter than it should.</p>\n<p>\u201cYer wrong there,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna welcome it with open arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts and says nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time they\u2019ve arrived, parked, and taken the elevator up to Sakusa\u2019s apartment, the two of them have hashed out the remaining details. Atsumu has insisted that Sakusa call him by his given name instead of <em> Miya</em>, which has the unfortunate habit of reminding him of his twin. Sakusa\u2019s reminded him of the traffic light system - green for keep going, yellow for slow down, and red for stop. Atsumu sent him a picture of his list two days ago, and Sakusa repeats it back to him word for word before asking him if anything\u2019s changed.</p>\n<p>If someone told Atsumu in high school that he would one day get hard from someone reciting a list he wrote, he would\u2019ve laughed in their face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get everything ready,\u201d Sakusa says as they put their bags down and toe off their shoes. \u201cDo you want anything to drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Go ahead and take a shower, then. I need some time to set up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu huffs, \u201cDo I still stink or somethin\u2019? I already showered in the lock-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em> very thorough </em> shower,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cDon\u2019t take it personally. I\u2019ll be taking one as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause as Atsumu\u2019s brain completely shuts down. When it boots back up, all he can think about is showering with Sakusa\u2014not just in his vicinity in the locker room, but <em> with </em>him-</p>\n<p>\u201cThe water pressure in the guest shower\u2019s been\u2026 a little lacking, I\u2019m told, recently. I\u2019ve got someone coming to fix it next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Right. Separate showers. Sakusa <em> would </em>be the kind of person to have one bedroom and two full bathrooms. Atsumu blinks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sure it\u2019ll be just fine, Omi-Omi. I\u2019m a different breed than the prissy trust-fund babies you\u2019re prob\u2019ly used to sleepin\u2019 with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s eye twitches. Because of the mask, Atsumu can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s fighting a laugh or trying not to scream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu follows Sakusa\u2019s instructions and takes a very thorough shower in the guest bathroom save for his hair, which he took the time to style after his post-practice shower. He remembers seeing Sakusa\u2019s list and being absolutely shocked that someone as cleanliness-obsessed as Sakusa was cool with ass-play. Atsumu\u2019s <em> pretty </em>sure that\u2019s something on the table for today, though, so he doesn\u2019t spare any detail in his cleansing routine.</p>\n<p>He knows BDSM isn\u2019t inherently sexual, but Sakusa\u2019s about to make him come. <em> Multiple times. </em> And he got that STI test and everything. Atsumu\u2019s pretty sure that qualifies as sexual. He\u2019s getting <em> laid </em> tonight - not only that, but it\u2019s his first time sleeping with a teammate.</p>\n<p>His mouth quirks and he hums happily to himself as he rinses off. Turns out no one is safe from his charms, not even the uncharmable Sakusa Kiyoomi.</p>\n<p>Atsumu wraps a towel around his hips, checks himself out in the mirror, then strolls into Sakusa\u2019s bathroom with his heart beating rabbit-quick, jumping against his ribcage when he sees Sakusa fiddling with something next to the bed. The other man is also fresh from the shower, but he\u2019s had enough time to put on his mask, <em> again, </em>plus a white button-up and black tailored slacks. Atsumu\u2019s mouth runs dry and he coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, got all dressed up for me, Omi-Omi? I thought ya said no Fifty Shades of Grey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa glares over at him. It might be a trick of the light, but Atsumu\u2019s <em> pretty </em>sure he sees Sakusa\u2019s cheeks color.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI might not be the focus of this scene, but sweatpants don\u2019t really command respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu hums, \u201cI thought ya were gonna be decked out in leather and latex, ya know? Like, \u2018welcome to my sex dungeon,\u2019 all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa puts his head in his black-gloved hands, muttering, \u201cOh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I put clothes on too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sakusa shakes his head, then fixes his eyes on Atsumu once more, the weight of his gaze palpable as it crawls up and down Atsumu\u2019s body. \u201cYou won\u2019t need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words bounce around inside Atsumu\u2019s head, nearly echoing after he stops talking. Atsumu has a moment, just a moment, where he realizes that this\u2014sleeping with a teammate, sleeping with <em> Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2014</em>might actually, in fact, not be the greatest idea he\u2019s ever had. He feels like a gazelle in one of those nature documentaries, except he\u2019s staring the lion full in the face instead of trying to run.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa murmurs.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s mouth is still so, so dry. He swallows and walks over to the bed, wondering just how badly he\u2019s blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what I set up,\u201d Sakusa says slowly, \u201cand you can let me know if you\u2019re okay with it, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is gentler than Atsumu\u2019s ever heard it, especially directed at <em> him. </em>He\u2019s not sure if he likes it or not. It makes his chest feel tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cS-sure,\u201d he manages.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are for your wrists,\u201d Sakusa says, gesturing to two leather cuffs attached to the headboard by chains. Atsumu remembers seeing those on that ill-fated day he decided to go exploring in Sakusa\u2019s bathroom. \u201cAnd this,\u201d he holds up a black metal bar with one leather cuff on each end, \u201cis for your legs. You\u2019re not going to be able to move much once I get these on you. Is that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s ears are ringing. Everything just became very real very quickly, including the nervous thrum of excitement pulsing underneath his skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa squints. Atsumu can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s smirking or sizing him up; it might be both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your color, Atsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>Color? What does he - <em> ohhh. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, um. Green.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Sakusa takes one of the cuffs and walks behind him, sliding his gloved hand down Atsumu\u2019s right arm and taking hold of his wrist, Atsumu realizes he might be in over his head. He can only watch, flushing fiercely, as Sakusa closes the padded leather around his wrist with a firm <em> click.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Right before Atsumu\u2019s brain vacates his skull, he comes to the realization that these particular black gloves are thin, nitrile - disposable. Because they\u2019re probably going to get messy.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too tight?\u201d Sakusa asks; he strokes a hand down Atsumu\u2019s hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s fingers tighten briefly, \u201cGood. Get on the bed, then. On your back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu does, slowly, the towel barely hanging onto his hips as he settles against the pillows. Sakusa reaches up and does something that makes the chain on the cuff tighten, drawing Atsumu\u2019s right arm firmly above his head, before climbing on the bed to join him. As Sakusa repeats the process with Atsumu\u2019s left wrist, Atsumu tugs experimentally on the other restraint and shivers when he can barely move his arm at all.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa picks up the metal bar - <em> a spreader bar, </em>if Atsumu\u2019s research serves him correctly. But the cuffs on the ends\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t those a little big for my ankles?\u201d he asks, watching Sakusa open up the first cuff. \u201cI don\u2019t have tree trunks for legs, ya know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa squints again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t for your ankles.\u201d He gets the buckle undone and lifts Atsumu\u2019s right leg off the bed, just enough to ease the leather underneath it. \u201cThey\u2019re for your thighs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu gasps when he feels the leather close around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you can use a spreader bar anywhere along someone\u2019s legs, but anyone with a basic knowledge of anatomy should be able to figure out that you can still move your thighs if your ankles are chained,\u201d Sakusa says, repeating the process with Atsumu\u2019s left leg, tightening the cuff just above his knee. He looks up when he\u2019s done, eyes boring into Atsumu\u2019s. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you to be able to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been a tent in the towel ever since Atsumu got on the bed. He squirms\u2014or <em> tries </em>to squirm. Sakusa\u2019s right, he can\u2019t close his legs now, plus he can\u2019t really do much with his arms either. It just makes him harder, especially when Sakusa\u2019s eyes slide between his thighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this,\u201d he says, voice unreadable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha - \u2018course I am!\u201d Atsumu splutters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What red-blooded dude <em> wouldn\u2019t </em>enjoy being at the mercy of someone as cold, dispassionate, and beautiful as\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that, but it\u2019s not a given,\u201d Sakusa says. His hands play with the hem of the towel. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t even started yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, he slides the towel to the side, dropping it to the floor. Atsumu makes a little sound in his throat\u2014he knows he has a nice dick, but what if Sakusa doesn\u2019t like it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Sakusa hums. \u201cPretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he reaches for the pump bottle of lube on the bedside table like he didn\u2019t just heat Atsumu\u2019s cheeks with the force of a thousand suns. He presses it a couple times, then makes a fist with that hand as he crawls between Atsumu\u2019s knees. Atsumu\u2019s dick twitches as Sakusa just...\u00a0<em> watches </em>him, for a few seconds. He turns his face to the side, desperately trying to hide against his bicep.</p>\n<p>Which means he isn\u2019t prepared for the warm, slick hand that wraps around him.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cNngh </em>fuck\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Distantly, Atsumu realizes that Sakusa waited for the lube to warm up. How considerate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sensitive,\u201d Sakusa comments, those long fingers sliding up and down, getting him wet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes an embarrassing noise when one fingertip circles the head of his cock, teasing; his belly lurches when the restraints prevent him from jerking away from the focused, intense touch.</p>\n<p>Fuck, his hand is so wet. Atsumu bites his lip and lets his head loll back against the pillows, panting as Sakusa falls into a rhythm and starts to jerk him off. It\u2019s hot, it\u2019s so hot\u2014it doesn\u2019t even matter that Sakusa is wearing gloves and a mask\u2014if anything, that makes it better\u2014Atsumu should probably get his head checked after this is all over\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Atsumu grits out, despite his best attempts to stay silent. \u201cOh my god-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Sakusa hums. He strokes Atsumu\u2019s thigh with his dry glove as his other hand squelches noisily every time he reaches the tip. Atsumu groans and tugs on the cuffs holding his wrists near the headboard. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in struggling, Atsumu. Unless you like confirming that you can\u2019t get away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holy <em> shit. </em> Atsumu bites his lip, dick throbbing as Sakusa continues to stroke him, slowly but evenly. He can feel himself leaking all over Sakusa\u2019s fingers, making things even more slick. Fuck, it\u2019s just a handjob, why is it so <em> good? </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s laughter in Sakusa\u2019s voice when he speaks next, \u201cI guess you do like it, then.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cOmiii,\u201d </em> Atsumu whines, bucking his hips up into Sakusa\u2019s fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move or I\u2019ll stop,\u201d Sakusa snaps.</p>\n<p>Oh, Jesus. Atsumu stifles a sob and tries to stay still, head spinning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa makes a noise that might be a laugh, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty obedient like this. I\u2019m surprised.\u201d Atsumu doesn\u2019t even have time to reply indignantly before Sakusa adds, \u201cMaybe\u2026 actually, yeah. Pull your knees up to your chest and hold them there.\u201d</p>\n<p>But\u2014but that would\u2014that\u2019s such a revealing position! Atsumu huffs in a breath, surprised he hasn\u2019t melted into the bed by now from embarrassment. Sakusa\u2019s hand slows on his cock and Atsumu whines, pushing everything else out of his mind and lifting his legs up in case Sakusa\u2019s waiting on him to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa takes his hand away completely and Atsumu makes a humiliatingly needy sound, legs shaking as he holds the new position. Sakusa doesn\u2019t even spare him a look as he leans over to get more lube, rubbing it between both hands this time. He nudges closer until his clothed knees are nearly touching Atsumu\u2019s ass, then leans down.</p>\n<p>Atsumu is not proud of his reaction when Sakusa wraps his hand back around him at the same time as a slick fingertip prods against his hole, but he can\u2019t fucking help it. He jumps, tensing up and relaxing so quickly that his legs go a little slack, then chokes when the spreader bar braces against Sakusa\u2019s chest and arms, leaving Atsumu\u2019s legs just <em> hanging there </em>, wide open. Stuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, I - oh god-\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws his head back and nearly bites down on his tongue when Sakusa slides one long finger inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m-\u201d Atsumu groans, shaking with the effort of holding still. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He normally lasts a lot longer than this, but something about not being able to move, and the double stimulation, and the gloves, and the almost <em> bored </em> way Sakusa is looking at him\u2014fuck, just\u2014something about <em> Sakusa </em> has him close already. The finger inside him twists, getting him wet there too, and Atsumu cries out, panting as his back arches involuntarily.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa murmurs. He squeezes him tight, rubs his thumb over the head, and says, \u201cCome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu comes so hard that stars pop behind his eyelids, so hard some of it gets on his chin. So hard he can\u2019t even make a sound. He strains at his bonds as Sakusa works him through it relentlessly.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s done, Sakusa\u2019s hands slow down, but they don\u2019t stop. Atsumu gasps in a much-needed breath and moans, aftershocks shuddering through him; he blinks his eyes open and shivers at the way Sakusa\u2019s have darkened.</p>\n<p>Then Sakusa picks the pace back up and Atsumu hisses, sensations turning from blissful to sharp in an instant. \u201cI-\u201d his voice comes out hoarse, so he swallows and tries again, \u201cOmi, give a guy a second t\u2019 breathe, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa cocks his head, arching an eyebrow. \u201cHmm.\u201d He squeezes in a second finger and Atsumu moans despite himself, toes curling. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>He curls his fingers and Atsumu grunts through clenched teeth when he pushes against his prostate, nerves fraying as Sakusa chuckles and locks onto that spot. Atsumu\u2019s dick is tingling, burning with oversensitivity as Sakusa keeps him hard with his tight, slippery grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cNnnngh - <em> fuck, </em>fuck fuck fuck-\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s never felt like this before, like he\u2019s trapped in his own body, bending to someone else\u2019s will. It\u2019s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time and he doesn\u2019t want it to stop. He grits his teeth, trying to show Sakusa that he can take whatever he can dish out, balling his hands into fists and digging his nails into his palms. Every muscle in his body is tense.</p>\n<p>\u201cColor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Atsumu stammers.</p>\n<p>Sakusa stills for a moment and Atsumu can\u2019t for the life of him decide if he\u2019s relieved or frustrated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour color, Atsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Green, green green green. C\u2019mon, keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa chuckles and resumes his movements, \u201cAnd here I thought you wanted me to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI - I don\u2019t-\u201d Atsumu whines as Sakusa\u2019s strokes get faster. \u201cI d-don\u2019t <em> know-\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Sakusa murmurs. Atsumu whines again, sharp heat blooming inside him as he trembles from the attention to his prostate. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful thing about this. You don\u2019t <em> have </em>to know. You don\u2019t have to decide what you want, because it doesn\u2019t matter what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu has to close his eyes, head spinning as his cock twitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em> god\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI can do this until you\u2019re coming dry if I want,\u201d Sakusa continues, fingers squelching as he takes Atsumu apart. \u201cAll you can do is take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019mgonnacomeagain,\u201d Atsumu slurs, chest heaving as he feels himself twitch around Sakusa\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>Sakusa makes a quiet noise. \u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, the build-up isn\u2019t smooth and euphoric like it normally is. It\u2019s choppy, ragged, every breath torn from Atsumu\u2019s lungs as Sakusa forces him higher and higher. The headboard is so sturdy that it barely even creaks as Atsumu tugs on the cuffs, desperate.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease - please-\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s asking for.</p>\n<p>Sakusa makes another noise and adds a third finger. It\u2019s enough of a stretch that it burns, and Atsumu <em> howls, </em>long past shame. Sakusa starts to fuck him with all three, thrusting deep over and over, and Atsumu\u2014Atsumu\u2014</p>\n<p><em> \u201cOmi,\u201d </em>he breathes, eyebrows knitting together, and then he comes.</p>\n<p>He hears Sakusa gasp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It fucking <em> hurts. </em>He\u2019s silent for most of it, breath caught in his chest as his cock jerks and spills over Sakusa\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Sakusa murmurs.</p>\n<p>As soon as Atsumu sucks in a breath he\u2019s groaning low, both pain and pleasure coloring his voice. He tries to get away from Sakusa\u2019s merciless fingers, but he\u2019s so weak and stupid from endorphins that all he can do is make his hips twitch. Maybe in response, Sakusa takes his hand off his cock to hold him still, keeping him in place as he finishes coming just from Sakusa\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s head lolls to the side when he\u2019s done, moaning quietly on every exhale. His balls are throbbing\u2014hell, his <em> dick </em>is throbbing, and not entirely in a good way.</p>\n<p>He hears Sakusa pump the lube bottle again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t even have the energy to be embarrassed about the way he whimpers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more,\u201d Sakusa says, wrapping his hand back around Atsumu\u2019s sore cock. \u201cGive me one more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Atsumu gasps. Sakusa curls his fingers and Atsumu hisses through clenched teeth. \u201cI <em> can\u2019t-\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head, delirious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not stopping until you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu whines. He\u2019s going to <em> die. </em>This is how he\u2019s going to go out, tied to Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s bed, covered in his own come. He\u2019s not going to survive this.</p>\n<p>Being tied up like this is doing really weird things to his brain. It\u2019s also doing really weird things to his dick\u2014he doesn\u2019t have anything else to focus on, nothing else to do except let the pleasure build and build. Sakusa\u2019s fingers inside him are electric, little horrible shocks every time he pushes against his prostate; it\u2019s making Atsumu tremble so badly that Sakusa\u2019s hand keeps slipping off him on the upstroke.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay still,\u201d Sakusa growls.</p>\n<p>Atsumu sobs. \u201cI c-can\u2019t - I <em> can\u2019t-\u201d </em> He\u2019s so tense that his muscles are starting to cramp. \u201cOmiii, Omi <em> please\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs. \u201cYou know what to do to make it stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls his fingers out a moment later; for a second, Atsumu thinks he\u2019s saved, that Sakusa is letting him off easy, but then he realizes Sakusa\u2019s just getting more lube for <em> that </em> hand, now. The slick tightness around his cock feels even more intense without the pressure on his overstimulated prostate; an agonizing sort of pleasure starts to build between his legs, dizzying and strong. It\u2019s intense enough that, even though it\u2019ll hurt, Atsumu <em> might </em>be able to come like this, as long as Sakusa doesn\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ohgodfuck. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Atsumu chokes when Sakusa slips his fingers back inside, burning with humiliation at the sloppy sounds of so much lube. He\u2019s close enough to the edge now that the used, sore feeling in his ass is pushing him closer instead of keeping him away. He\u2019s going to die he\u2019s going to die\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re squeezing around me again,\u201d Sakusa observes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMhhmm\u2019gonna,\u201d Atsumu slurs, his eyes fluttering closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? You\u2019re gonna come for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s head weighs a thousand pounds as he tries to nod, fire starting to spread from his core. It feels good to say yes - he feels owned, in a way he never has before. \u201cS\u2019f\u2019ryou\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The last thing Atsumu\u2019s aware of is Sakusa drawing in a sharp breath. Then his body ignites and his back arches clean off the bed, come dribbling from his aching cock as his orgasm rips a groan from deep in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blissfully\u2014<em>blessedly\u2014</em>Sakusa\u2019s hands slow down as Atsumu does, and he finally takes both away once Atsumu\u2019s back to lying limp on the bed, wrung out and exhausted. He doesn\u2019t even have the energy to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Sakusa shifts on the bed. There\u2019s a snap and some rustling, then the cool, clean touch of a new pair of gloves on Atsumu\u2019s sweaty skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take these off now, okay, Atsumu?\u201d Sakusa\u2019s using that gentle voice again. Atsumu likes it even better now that he\u2019s been through the wringer. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you clean up and you can relax a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu smiles and nods, eyes still too heavy to open. He sighs in relief as Sakusa unbuckles the spreader bar, his legs falling limp on either side of Sakusa\u2019s body as soon as they\u2019re out of the restraint. He feels Sakusa lean over him to undo the cuffs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa massages Atsumu\u2019s wrists after each one is released and says, \u201cYou did great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whoa, Sakusa has <em> never </em> been this nice to him, like, <em> ever. </em>Boy is Atsumu going to savor this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go get a washcloth. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu stretches out and sighs again, fighting the urge to curl up on his side before he\u2019s gotten all the come and sweat off of him. Sakusa is back before Atsumu can go through with it, sweeping a warm, damp cloth over Atsumu\u2019s abdomen and chest.</p>\n<p>Sakusa hums. \u201cI\u2019m gonna clean the lube off too, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019kay,\u201d Atsumu manages, surprising himself with how ragged his voice is. He appreciates the warning so he\u2019s prepared for the cloth to run over his oversensitive cock and balls, then between his legs, leaving a much cleaner feeling in its wake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that he\u2019s free to turn onto his side, Atsumu takes advantage of it immediately, curling up into the fetal position and taking in a deep breath, exhaling as he relaxes into the bed. He smiles and squirms when a thick fleece blanket is draped over him.</p>\n<p>He feels the bed dip behind him as Sakusa sits down. A hand comes to rest atop his head and Atsumu sighs. It\u2019s not exactly cuddling, but it\u2019s comforting, which he assumes is the point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods. He can\u2019t remember a time he felt this at peace. He lets himself drift, trusting that Sakusa will let him know what to do next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi lets Atsumu rest for a little while. He can\u2019t help but note the small smile resting on the other man\u2019s face. He seems completely content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to clean up a few things in here. Let\u2019s move to the couch, if you feel like you\u2019re ready to walk?\u201d Kiyoomi says in a low voice.</p>\n<p>Atsumu stirs, stretching his arms out and almost hitting Kiyoomi in the face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sounds good,\u201d Atsumu says, voice raspier and softer than Kiyoomi\u2019s heard it before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s definitely not <em> under</em>, but he\u2019s still quiet and compliant as Kiyoomi helps him get up and dressed in the clean set of comfortable clothes he\u2019d instructed the other man to bring with him. Kiyoomi then wraps the large fleece blanket back around his shoulders and leads the way down the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake a seat here and feel free to pick something to watch on the TV for a bit. I have Netflix and cable, let me know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019ll make some tea and be back in just a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa got a system here, Omi-kun?\u201d Atsumu asks with a wry turn of his lips that\u2019s frustratingly endearing when tempered by the heavy softness currently in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi smirks a little behind the mask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want green or black tea?\u201d he asks. \u201cI also have jasmine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, jasmine. How fancy,\u201d Atsumu mocks, a good sign his head\u2019s clearing up. \u201cWhen in Rome, I s\u2019pose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi takes that as a selection and heads towards the kitchen. Atsumu isn\u2019t wrong. This <em> is </em>his system. He\u2019s never been a naturally cuddly or effusive person, and he doesn\u2019t want his subs getting the wrong ideas about their relationship, so he\u2019s had to come up with other ways to make sure that they feel properly taken care of after a scene. That\u2019s important to Kiyoomi. He\u2019s not a total asshole, like some might claim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he also doesn\u2019t want a sub to fall asleep in his bed.</p>\n<p>So when a scene is finished he makes sure they\u2019re okay, cleans them up, and provides water and blankets as needed. When they\u2019re ready, he directs them to the couch, where he can let them pick something to watch on his television\u2014something they find comforting, but that has a clear ending. He makes them a drink and then goes to clean up anything left over from the scene. Once that\u2019s done, he sits with them until the end of their program and arranges a way for them to get home. It\u2019s a <em> good </em> system.</p>\n<p>When the tea is finished Kiyoomi brings it out in a traditional, earthenware teacup and places it gently in Atsumu\u2019s fleece covered hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Omi,\u201d Atsumu says, looking\u2014for lack of better words\u2014sweet and gentle wrapped in the blanket, tea in his lap, with the TV flipped to the Raijin/Red Falcons game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go tidy up in the other room,\u201d Kiyoomi says. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in just a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes about twenty minutes to meticulously clean the bedroom. When Kiyoomi returns to the living room, he takes a seat on the other end of the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the final score of the third set?\u201d Kiyoomi asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNineteen to twenty-five,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cLooks like the Falcons gave up the first set but they\u2019ve had the momentum since I flipped the match on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Kiyoomi acknowledges, eyes trained on the screen.</p>\n<p>True to Atsumu\u2019s assessment, the Red Falcons also take the fourth set to win the match. When the final whistle blows, Atsumu gets up without prompting. He folds the throw blanket and then groans as he stretches again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s got his shoes on and his bag slung over his shoulder, he looks back to Kiyoomi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the good time, Omi-Omi,\u201d he says, opening the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seemed to enjoy it,\u201d Kiyoomi replies. \u201cMore than I thought you would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, ye of little faith.\u201d He hitches his bag higher. \u201cAnyway, I know ya said one time, but since you let me pick something, dontcha think it\u2019s only fair for me to do something <em> you </em> wanna do, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a thought. Night, Omi-kun.\u201d</p>\n<p>He winks\u2014<em>winks\u2014</em>and then he shuts the door quickly, before Kiyoomi can even form a response. His eyes are wide, staring at the empty genkan. It\u2019s sinking in, the realization that Kiyoomi\u2019s been pushing off since he snapped the first cuff around Atsumu\u2019s wrist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was\u2026 a <em> really </em>good scene.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi puts his head in his hands. Atsumu, brand new to kink, never having subbed before, with <em> that </em> personality\u2026 it\u2019s not the best scene that Kiyoomi has <em> ever </em> been a part of, but it was certainly the best he\u2019s had with a sub he\u2019s never played with before.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t even expect Atsumu to <em> like </em> it once he was actually faced with the situation up close. Kiyoomi would have bet against Atsumu even going through with it... and <em> yet</em>, not only is he actually sort of a natural, but he and Kiyoomi are <em> compatible</em>.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi groans into his palms. This can\u2019t be happening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to <em> ask </em> Miya Atsumu to sub for him\u2026 <em> again</em>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>"
