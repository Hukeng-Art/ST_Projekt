  "text": "<p>Lan Xichen had told himself not to worry when he and his brother had been summoned to their uncle\u2019s chambers just as the foreign sect\u2019s children were arriving in Cloud Recesses. Looking at their uncle now, he\u2019s wondering if that was a mistake. Uncle looks moments away from pinching the bridge of his nose to stave off a headache.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you earlier because I thought there was a decent chance that he wouldn\u2019t even show up,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBut I just received word that he\u2019s passed through the gate. Wei Wuxian is going to be joining the guest disciples.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unusual for a rogue cultivator to be invited, but not unheard of, especially considering the friendship between Uncle and Cangse Sanren that he\u2019s almost certain actually exists and isn\u2019t just rumors. \u201cDo you foresee a problem? He\u2019s a very accomplished cultivator.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite being Wangji\u2019s age and not being allied with any sect, Wei Wuxian had made quite a name for himself. He learned to cultivate under his parent\u2019s tutelage, had been a guest disciple of the Jiangs, traveled for several years with the famous rogue cultivators Xiao Xingchan and Song Lan, and there were even rumors that he\u2019d even somehow snuck up to Baoshan Sanren\u2019s mountain and convinced her take him on as a pupil, although Lan Xichen thought that had to be just a rumor.</p>\n<p>While that was all impressive, what truly distinguished him had only happened last year. Yiling had come under near constant attacks from fierce corpses and resentful energy that most cultivators had refused to deal with.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian, his parents, Xiao Xingchen, and Song Lan and they\u2019d erected a barrier of glittering resentful energy around the base of the mountain, containing all the miserable and frightful things that had plagued the area of the Yiling. It harnessed the natural resentful of the energy of the mountain and channeled it through several complicated talismans and arrays.</p>\n<p>Copies had been sent to the heads of every sect so to avoid rumors of demonic cultivation, something that reportedly had been Wei Changze\u2019s idea. The arrays were deceptively simply, barely different than what most sects were already using. It\u2019s just that no one had thought to use them quite like that before. Rumors credited everyone <em>but</em> Wei Wuxian, which surely meant he was the one truly responsible.</p>\n<p>They called him the Yiling Patriarch and that he was still a teenager hadn\u2019t seemed to matter much to anyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think he\u2019s here to learn?\u201d Uncle asks, and Lan Xichen has to concede that it\u2019s unlikely. There is little in their cultivation classes that Wei Wuxian would not be able to learn on his own or from his many mentors. \u201cNo, that little brat is working on another invention and he wants use of the library without having to go through formal channels. Little hellion. No matter what he pulls or what mischief he starts, you mustn\u2019t get caught up in it, understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Even Wangji seemed taken back at Uncle\u2019s vehemence. They hadn\u2019t known that Uncle knew Wei Wuxian personally, but it seems he must, to be this disgruntled. \u201cDisliking Wei Wuxian will not stop us from upholding the Lan practice of courtesy and decorum,\u201d Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Uncle stares. Wangji breathes like he wants to shift his weight, but doesn\u2019t. \u201cI never said you\u2019d dislike him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever either of them have to say to that is cut off by a loud, boisterous voice outside the door shouting, \u201cUNCLE QIREN!\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle grips the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>The door slams open and in comes a young man who must be Wei Wuxian, black and white robes with hints of purple along the edge and his hair bound up in purple silk ribbon much finer than anything else he\u2019s wearing. He doesn\u2019t bow or pause, instead crossing the room and throwing his arms around Uncle in a hug.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen wonders if perhaps he hit his head and this all a dream or maybe a hallucination.</p>\n<p>Uncle turns a shade of red he hadn\u2019t previously known him capable of and a vein twitches in his forehead, but he doesn\u2019t push him away. \u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs and steps back, going into a picture perfect, formal bow. \u201cThis is from my father,\u201d then he darts forward to yank on Uncle\u2019s beard. Wangji\u2019s eyes have widened in horror. \u201cAnd that\u2019s from my mother!\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle rubs at his chin and glares. \u201cWho was the hug from then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Wei Wuxian says shamelessly. \u201cI missed you, Uncle Qiren! We\u2019re going to have so much fun, aren\u2019t we? We should go to Caiyi so I can drink Emperor\u2019s Smile and you can yell at me for being right in ways you don\u2019t like, that always cheers you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen can\u2019t be seeing what he\u2019s seeing. Uncle\u2019s lips are pressed into a firm, tight line, like he does when he\u2019s trying not to smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, very loudly and right in front them. \u201cYou must be Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji! I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd us you,\u201d he says, after only a half second\u2019s hesitation.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t paying attention to him, instead focused on Wangji. \u201cAw, don\u2019t look so disapproving, it\u2019s good to keep Uncle Qiren on his toes.\u201d Wangji\u2019s face doesn\u2019t look anything besides entirely blank. Lan Xichen can\u2019t help but be impressed, since most of the clan elders wouldn\u2019t have been able to pick up on that. His admiration quickly turns to dismay when Wei Wuxian reaches out and uses his fingers to push his brother\u2019s lips into a facsimile of a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen has to resist the urge to gape. Using his brother\u2019s given name like that, when they\u2019ve just met! What\u2019s worse is Uncle doesn\u2019t even look surprised, just resigned.</p>\n<p>Wangji scowls and he reaches for Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists, but Wei Wuxian slips away, just out of his reach, still laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be faster than that to catch me, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s then darting out the door, which he hadn\u2019t even closed in the first place, like he actually expects the Second Jade of Lan to go chasing after him.</p>\n<p>Wangji takes a stop forward before remembering himself and freezing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Unfamiliar voices are calling the boy\u2019s name. They all step outside to see a crowd of guest disciples grinning and waving.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Cheng!\u201d Wei Wuxian waves back. \u201cA-Sang!\u201d</p>\n<p>He runs down the steps toward them, still grinning. \u201cNo running!\u201d Uncle barks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Uncle Qiren!\u201d Without skipping a beat, Wei Wuxian tucks his sword into his best and launches himself forward, doing continuous cartwheels down the steps even quicker than he\u2019d been running. The guest disciples are cheering, and even Lan Xichen has to admit that it\u2019s an impressive display of strength and balance.</p>\n<p>Technically, there is no rule against cartwheeling in Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>Uncle sighs. \u201cThe problem,\u201d he says mournfully, \u201cis that if I make a rule just for him, he and his mother will be far too pleased with themselves, and then he\u2019ll just put even more effort into not breaking the rules in ways that make me add more rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen notices how Wangji hasn\u2019t taken his eyes off Wei Wuxian and thinks that perhaps they have bigger problems, actually.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Classes are meant to start the next day and Xichen is doing a final run through the syllabus with him when there\u2019s a loud, erratic knock on his door. \u201cUncle Qiren!\u201d</p>\n<p>At least Wei Wuxian is knocking this time instead of just barging in. He despairs that his standards have sunk so low. \u201cUse a proper knock! Have some decorum! I know your father taught you how.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs so loudly that he can hear it through the door. Then there\u2019s a single, soft tap and he\u2019s modulated his voice to sound deferential and respectful. \u201cSect Leader Lan, the humble Wei Wuxian requests an audience at your convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an uncomfortable jolt around his stomach. He\u2019s sure, suddenly, that Wei Changze did teach him this, and that he learned from his time as a servant rather than a cultivator, and now he regrets asking. \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slides open and Wei Wuxian is on his knees, his arms clasped in front of him as he bows at the waist. \u201cMay this lowly rogue cultivator speak to the great Master Lan?\u201d</p>\n<p>The tone and posture are all perfectly respectful and Lan Qiren hates it. It helps, slightly, that he knows Wei Wuxian is doing this to mock him. \u201cYes, yes, you\u2019ve proven your point. Get up, boy, you\u2019ll get dust on your robes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if your home has dust in it,\u201d he scoffs, bouncing to his feet with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re too scary for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren knows that addressing the ridiculous statement is a bad idea, because it only encourages him the same way it used to encourages his mother, but Lan Qiren also knows his own weaknesses. Unfortunately, so does Wei Wuxian. That means that even though he knows better he can\u2019t help but sputter, \u201cAre you implying that I <em>scare</em> the dust away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour scowl is very intimidating,\u201d he says earnestly, then pauses, \u201cor so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s scowling right now and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t seem intimidated in the slightest. \u201cDid you want something or are you just here to antagonize me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle Qiren!\u201d he gasps, laying a hand on his chest in mock offense. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s both. Maybe I\u2019m here because I want to antagonize you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bottom half of Xichen\u2019s face trembles like he\u2019s clenching his teeth to keep from laughing and he finds himself softening even as he doesn\u2019t let up on the scowl. They\u2019re both so serious, his boys, and he knows that\u2019s his fault, him raising them how he\u2019d been raised because it\u2019s all he knew and now they lean a little bit too much like him sometimes, in ways he wishes they didn\u2019t. Maybe the headache of having Wei Wuxian in Cloud Recesses will be worth it if it helps draw them out a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, are those lesson plans?\u201d He snatches the paper off his desk without waiting for an answer and sits himself at the edge, breaking several rules about respect and impropriety and also just common decency. Xichen\u2019s eyes are wide but Lan Qiren doesn\u2019t bother to bring any of that up. He\u2019ll save his energy for the arguments that are worth winning. Wei Wuxian ruffles through them for a few moments, his eyebrows pushing together. By the time he lowers the papers he\u2019s actually frowning. \u201c<em>Uncle Qiren</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that wanted to be here,\u201d he points out mildly.</p>\n<p>Xichen unclenches his jaw enough to ask, \u201cIs there a problem with the lesson plans, Young Master Wei?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you to stop calling me that,\u201d he says, and glances down at the papers again before sighing. \u201cNo, no, nothing wrong with them. They\u2019re very good.\u201d He pauses. \u201cThe clan heirs are going to be bored. Even A-Sang already knows all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way he petulantly kicks his feet against the desk like a little kid is not endearing. \u201cMost of our attendants haven\u2019t receive a clan heir\u2019s education, so this is to their benefit.\u201d Most of the clan heirs are here to socialize, which isn\u2019t a criticism. One day they\u2019ll be in charge of their clan and things run smoother for everyone when clan heads can at least be friendly with one another. \u201cYou could have just asked to use our library, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said anything about the library?\u201d he asks innocently. Lan Qiren just continues staring at him. He huffs, crossing his arms, which really only adds to his little kid air. \u201cI\u2019d have needed to submit all these detailed plans and explanations of what I was working on and then waited for the approval of all the Lan elders for that. It would have taken forever. This is better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know <em>I\u2019m</em> going to want copies of all your plans, right?\u201d He\u2019s heard too many tales about Wei Wuxian\u2019s destructive creative process to just give him leave to experiment in the middle of Cloud Recesses without oversight.</p>\n<p>He waves a hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s you, Uncle Qiren.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren rolls his eyes and tries not to let that matter to him as much as it does.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Uncle sighs deeply. Wei Wuxian has been in Cloud Recesses a week and it seems as if Uncle has sighed more in the past week than he had in the past year.</p>\n<p>Uncle has also been smiling a lot more. He\u2019d been right. Wei Wuxian is disruptive and irreverent and unapologetic and Lan Xichen <em>does</em> like him. It\u2019s hard not to.</p>\n<p>The male and female cultivators are mixed together on the field in the hour before dinner, talking and laughing. In the middle stands Wei Wuxian, holding court as he tells another story from his travels that Lan Xichen is certain has to be at least half fake. He <em>hopes</em> it is, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Uncle grumbles. \u201cCangse Sanren was the most sought after bride of our generation. Every sect heir asked after her hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet she married a man who\u2019d been no more than a servant until his spiritual energy had been too strong to ignore. The Jiang had taken him in as their disciple to the loud disapproval of several clans.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen tilts his head to the side. \u201cUncle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t see it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks back out and bites the inside of his cheek to keep his smile from spreading into a grin. The foreign disciples and even some of the Lan do fawn over Wei Wuxian, many of them seemingly just as focused on getting his attention as they are on their studies. Wei Wuxian is friendly to everyone, of course, but despite their best efforts he doesn\u2019t seem to be friends with everyone. Then again, it\u2019s only been a week.</p>\n<p>There are a couple notable exceptions.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli don\u2019t engage in all the fuss because they don\u2019t have to. Wei Wuxian wears the ribbon they gave him in his hair, the lotuses embroidered in it so subtle Lan Xichen hadn\u2019t noticed them until a week after classes had started. It\u2019s clear the Jiang siblings and Wei Wuxian adore one another, which mean Jiang Cheng watches the proceedings with smug superiority and Jiang Yanli with gentle tolerance.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang will act ridiculous around Wei Wuxian only as a way to egg him on, the two of them feeding off each other and even pulling Jiang Cheng into their mischief over his protests. A couple of years ago, Wei Wuxian and his parents had assisted the Nie with some sort of clan issue. No one knows what it was, but it means they have an open invitation to the Unclean Realms and apparently Wei Wuxian goes there to relax and goof off with Nie Huaisang. Lan Xichen can\u2019t imagine anyone going to the Unclean Realms to relax.</p>\n<p>Luo Qingyang, an otherwise obedient and dutiful student, is always the first one to agree to Wei Wuxian\u2019s plans, no questions asked. She has all the unreserved trust of Nie Huaisang with the skills of Jiang Cheng which means, no matter the circumstances, if Wei Wuxian has found trouble, then Luo Qingyang isn\u2019t far behind. He\u2019d overheard her asking Wei Wuxian wistful questions about being a rogue cultivator.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning and Wen Qing are quiet and reserved and do not seek out anyone\u2019s company. Except Wei Wuxian had greeted them enthusiastically and familiarly, pulled them into his circle of friends, and hadn\u2019t let them leave. Wen Qing is surprisingly vicious under her polite smiles. Wei Wuxian has no reason to know either of them, but they seemed so familiar together that Lan Xichen thinks they must have met before, somehow.</p>\n<p>Then again, there\u2019s his brother. Wangji is standing arms clasped behind his back as he radiates skepticism at the more ridiculous parts of the tale and doesn\u2019t even flinch when Wei Wuxian hangs off his shoulders. Wangji spends more time scolding Wei Wuxian and making him copy lines than anything else, but instead of being upset, Wei Wuxian just seems to get more and more delighted with every interaction. Wangji is being pulled between towering frustration and reluctant fondness and personally Lan Xichen finds it hilarious.</p>\n<p>There are very few people that Wei Wuxian seems to dislike. One of them is Jin Zixuan. Who Wei Wuxian has abandoned storytelling to gang up on. Again.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen might feel worse for him if he hadn\u2019t said several truly thoughtless things about Jiang Yanli. The fact that Wei Wuxian\u2019s dislike stems from his annoyance at Jin Zixuan treatment of his fianc\u00e9, and considering Jiang Cheng shares that same dislike even if he does a better job at hiding it, makes it very hard to consider it a bad thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better get your act together, otherwise I\u2019ll marry A-Li myself,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, hands on his hips. It\u2019s a common threat. Considering the ribbon in his hair, it\u2019s even a believable one.</p>\n<p>The confused jealousy that overcomes Wangji\u2019s face is genuinely one of his favorite things to see. Uncle just sighs again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Jin Zixuan says, his face flushing. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Our marriage is already arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d Wei Wuxian scoffs. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll grab A-Li and carry her up the mountain to Baoshan Sanren so she can marry us. We\u2019ll adopt a bunch of kids and A-Li can make them soup while I teach them to cultivate and Aunty Bao will be so happy about great grandkids that she won\u2019t even yell at me for bringing people up the mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen is still sure that Wei Wuxian being taught by Baoshan Sanren is just a rumor. He\u2019s <em>sure</em> of it.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang flicks out his fan to hide half his face behind it. \u201cAdopt?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s clearly doing it just stir up more trouble. Lan Xichen likes him too. He\u2019s coming to the regrettable realization that maybe he enjoys being around troublemakers, which is unfortunate considering the clan he\u2019s to lead. Then again, that\u2019s what guest disciples are for.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Wei Wuxian lays a hand across his chest. \u201cA-Li is like my sister, of course we\u2019d adopt, don\u2019t be crude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji looks slightly less like he wants to commit an act of violence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she\u2019s like a sister, then why do you keep saying you\u2019ll marry her?\u201d Jin Zixuan grumbles.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s face drops and his shoulders rise, for a moment everything about him perfectly serious. \u201cBetter a passionless marriage than a loveless one.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets that hang in the air for a moment while Jin Zixuan turns an even deeper shade of red.</p>\n<p>Then he grins, shattering the moment. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll show you exactly what will happen.\u201d He runs over to Jiang Yanli and scoops her into his arms. That Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t react at all to his precious older sister being manhandled by Wei Wuxian tells everyone everything they need to know about the dynamic and affection that runs between the three of them. Jiang Yanli laughs and wraps an arm around his shoulders to steady herself. \u201cI will carry A-Li up the mountain and then when I get to the top I\u2019ll say, Aunty Bao, I\u2019ve brought you the second most beautiful person in all the word as a granddaughter in law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond most?\u201d Jiang Cheng scoffs. \u201cWho\u2019s the first?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, of course,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers. Uncle makes an aborted gesture as if to rub his forehead.</p>\n<p>Wangji freezes, his face going so perfectly blank that Lan Xichen can\u2019t read anything from him besides the panic.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gently puts Jiang Yanli back on her feet and then turns and \u2013</p>\n<p>- lifts Wangji into his arms much the same way he\u2019d held Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible Lan Xichen is going to watch his brother die of bloodloss since it\u2019s all rushing so quickly to his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will carry Lan Zhan up the mountain,\u201d Wei Wuxian declares, \u201cand I will say, Aunty Bao, I\u2019ve brought you the most beautiful person in all the world to become your grandson in law.\u201d He pauses, looking down at Wangji, who hasn\u2019t pushed himself out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s arms and is just staring at him now. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have to adopt, Lan Zhan. How many children do you want? I want lots.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji struggles for a moment that spits out, \u201cRidiculous,\u201d before finally pushing himself out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>Uncle has given up and is massaging his temples. \u201cI\u2019m going to go meditate. This is what I was <em>afraid of</em> when he asked to attend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he can inquire further, Uncle is walking away, muttering about how large of sum Cangse Sanren has just won and seems to be doing mental math to figure out if his wins outweigh the losses.</p>\n<p>Gambling is forbidden in Cloud Recesses. Lan Xichen decides to be the bigger person and not mention it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t exactly planned on getting caught drinking with Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang, and certainly not by Lan Zhan who, unlike his brother, hasn\u2019t seemed to fall for his charms <em>at all</em>, which is shame, because Wei Wuxian considers himself to be very charming. His father told him so.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re busted, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re getting out of this without Uncle Qiren beating them badly enough to leave bruises that will at least last a day even with cultivation healing, so there\u2019s no reason not to get one more bit of fun in there.</p>\n<p>He tricks Lan Zhan into taking a sip of the wine, expecting him to spit it out as soon as he tastes it\u2019s alcoholic, expecting his eyes to go bright with fury and his pale cheeks to flush and really, what beating couldn\u2019t be worth that?</p>\n<p>Instead he takes a sip and immediately passes out. Wei Wuxian barely catches him in time to keep him from cracking his head open on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, eyes wide, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian presses his fingers to Lan Zhan\u2019s wrist, but his pulse is steady and the thrum of his golden core is as strong as ever. He blinks. \u201cI genuinely have no idea.\u201d He reaches for cup Lan Zhan had drank from and drinks the rest in one swallow. It goes down smoothly and tastes no different than what they\u2019d been drinking. \u201cIt\u2019s not poisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought it was poisoned and you still drank it?\u201d Jiang Cheng squawks.</p>\n<p>He ignores him and pulls Lan Zhan up again to shake him, but all that happens is his forehead ribbon goes slightly askew. He almost fixes it before he remembers that he\u2019s definitely not allowed to do that.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang pokes his shoulder with his fan. \u201cIs he dead? Did you kill him?\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Jiang Cheng roll their eyes at the same time. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could just put him to bed?\u201d Jiang Cheng suggests. \u201cHe can sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep what off? He had a <em>sip</em>,\u201d Nie Huaisang protests.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting. He\u2019s almost certain that Lan Zhan is fine. There\u2019s nothing to indicate he\u2019s anything else but perfectly fine. If he\u2019s really worried about, he could go ask Wen Qing to take a look, and she\u2019d rip him a new one but she\u2019d still do it.</p>\n<p>He sighs and picks Lan Zhan up, carrying him like he\u2019d had for those brief moments in the field, where he could get away with it, and jostling him until his head thumps against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to take him to Uncle Qiren.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang are horrified. \u201cWhy? Are you insane? He\u2019ll toss you out for sure!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d He\u2019s not even close to finished working on his compass and the Jiang library doesn\u2019t have the same number of theoretical talisman texts that the Lan library does.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou break rules all the time, why are you hurrying to go confess this one?\u201d Nie Huaisang demands.</p>\n<p>He shrugs, then because Nie Huaisang probably deserves a real answer and Jiang Cheng definitely does, adds, \u201cThat\u2019s stuff that doesn\u2019t matter. Uncle Qiren doesn\u2019t really care when I break the rules. Or he does, but like, only on principle? Like he cares because the rules are important and he believes in them, not because he actually has any personal feelings about me going to bed late. But he\u2019ll care about Lan Zhan passing out, so I should tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Uncle Qiren of have a very careful balancing act of Wei Wuxian trampling all over his rules and him pretending he hates it. Luckily his mother established the dynamic first, so Wei Wuxian just gets to benefit off of her hard work, but it means that when he actually fucks up he has to come clean about it. Which is the worst. If this was the Unclean Realms or Lotus Pier they wouldn\u2019t confess their misdeeds until\u2026 well, ever, really. The less Nie Mingjue and Aunt Yu know about what they get up to behind their backs, the better.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t say anything about you guys,\u201d he promises.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t seem to reassure them like he thought it would. Jiang Cheng says, \u201cIf Lan Qiren tries to kill you, send up a flare and we\u2019ll come save you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if you guys are a match for Uncle Qiren,\u201d he scoffs and then winks at them before heading out.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is pretty much entirely solid muscle and it probably would have been easier to carry him on his back, but it\u2019s too late for that now, so he just hurries, because he hardly thinks that dropping Lan Zhan will improve the situation.</p>\n<p>He hesitates outside Uncle Qiren\u2019s home. It\u2019s after nine, which means he\u2019s probably already asleep. He\u2019s out of hands, so he kicks the door as gently as he can and calls out, \u201cUncle Qiren!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, then footsteps, and the door slides open. There are low candles and paperwork strewn about behind him and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t even get the chance to tease him about breaking curfew before he snaps, \u201cWangji! What is the meaning of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Qiren is glaring at Lan Zhan, which doesn\u2019t make any sense, but then he looks down and sees Lan Zhan\u2019s dark eyes staring right at him. He yelps and nearly drops him in surprise, and then clutches him even more tightly to make up for it. \u201cLan Zhan! When did you wake up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t answer, just continues staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he <em>drunk</em>?\u201d Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think Uncle Qiren\u2019s voice has ever quite reached that pitch before, but he\u2019d need his mother here to know for sure.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s head is still resting against We Wuxian\u2019s soldier, his cheeks flushed and his fingers curled around the edge of Wei Wuxian\u2019s over robe.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost unbearably cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Uncle Qiren demands.</p>\n<p>He winces. That\u2019s the tone that Uncle Qiren uses when he\u2019s actually mad. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he says, then quickly recounts what had happened, finishing it with, \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to get him drunk or anything. I didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d react like this or even think he\u2019d end up breaking a rule since I thought he\u2019d spit it out when he tasted it. He really only had a sip, Uncle Qiren, I swear!\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Qiren has one hand hand over his eyes and the other on his hip. He peeks through his fingers, like the sight might have changed, then groans and turns away. He crosses his arms over his chest then turns around again. \u201cCopy all three thousand rules tomorrow.\u201d He pulls a face, but he usually uses papermen for that and instead spends the time working on his compass, so it\u2019s barely a punishment at all.</p>\n<p>The thing is, he\u2019s pretty sure Uncle Qiren knows that. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Qiren sighs, looking at Lan Zhan again. Something softens in his face, how he always looks at his nephews when he thinks they can\u2019t see him. \u201cLan have no alcohol tolerance, you really should have expected this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s his turn to stare. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you drink. I\u2019ve been out drinking <em>with you</em>. You do not pass out after one sip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI use my golden core to burn away the effects of the alcohol as I drink.\u201d This is the worst thing Wei Wuxian\u2019s ever heard. What a waste of alcohol! \u201cI\u2019m not going to punish Wangji for your actions, although he should know better than to drink something without knowing it\u2019s contents.\u201d Wei Wuxian is certain he wouldn\u2019t be so lenient if this had all come out in the morning, no matter if he\u2019d like to be, because the elders certainly wouldn\u2019t stand for it. \u201cAs for your punishment, in addition to doing lines, you can spend the evening with Wangji until he sobers up. He\u2019s your responsibility until then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t gape, but he comes pretty close. \u201cUm, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says, going to close the door again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Uncle Qiren pauses, raising an eyebrow. \u201cUm, can you fix his forehead ribbon?\u201d</p>\n<p>His face softens even further and he steps forward to gently slide Lan Zhan\u2019s ribbon back in place. That finally gets Lan Zhan\u2019s attention and he looks away from him to stare at Uncle Qiren, who\u2019s hand is resting on top of Lan Zhan\u2019s head, his thumb just barely brushing the ribbon in a gesture that reminds Wei Wuxian so much of his own father that homesickness tightens his throat. He\u2019s been apart from his parents before, of course, like when he\u2019d been with Song Lan and Xiao Xingchan. He can\u2019t follow his parents around the world like a kid forever. He still misses them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Uncle,\u201d Lan Zhan says, his voice syrup slow. He reaches out and touches Uncle Qiren\u2019s forehead ribbon, his touch clumsier but somehow no less gentle.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels like he shouldn\u2019t be here. \u201cI can leave him with you, if you want?\u201d Uncle Qiren can\u2019t usually express affection without yelling and it feels wrong to get in the way of that.</p>\n<p>Uncle Qiren clears his throat and Wei Wuxian pretends he doesn\u2019t notice the tears he\u2019s blinking back. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, reaching up to take Lan Zhan\u2019s hand away and placing it back where he can curl it into Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes. \u201cI\u2019m an old man, Wei Wuxian, I need my sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, right. Wei Wuxian almost calls him on it, but there\u2019s still something fragile in his expression, so he just says, \u201cOkay, Uncle Qiren.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, he doesn\u2019t stop him when he closes the door.</p>\n<p>He warily puts Lan Zhan back on his feet, careful in case he collapses again, but he stands as solidly as ever. \u201cIt\u2019s late, Lan Zhan,\u201d he tries. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we got to bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes widen. \u201cBed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he blinks. \u201cUm, it\u2019s past nine. You need to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, mouth turning down at the corner before he nods. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches out and grabs Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist in a strong grip that Wei Wuxian would struggle to break even if he wanted to. He doesn\u2019t, letting Lan Zhan pull him along to his rooms.</p>\n<p>Except instead of getting ready to go to sleep, Lan Zhan climbs straight into bed and drags Wei Wuxian with him. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he yelps where he has to twist his body to keep from kneeing him in the stomach. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he says simply. \u201cWe\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Uncle Qiren told me to keep in eye on you, I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t mean in the same bed,\u201d he points out. \u201cCome on, let me go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan frowns, as if considering it, then says, \u201cNo.\u201d Wei Wuxian sputters and Lan Zhan closes his eyes and from all appearances instantly falls into a deep sleep.</p>\n<p>His grip on Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t let up at all.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs, but honestly he\u2019s slept a lot more uncomfortable places than Lan Zhan\u2019s very nice bed, and well, Uncle Qiren had told him to keep an eye on him until he sobered up.</p>\n<p>He wriggles until he\u2019s laying sideways in the bad, curled towards Lan Zhan who\u2019s sleeping on his back in a way that doesn\u2019t look at all comfortable.</p>\n<p>The headpiece doesn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know not to touch your ribbon, but surely you\u2019ll be more comfortable with your hair down, hm, Lan Zhan?\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan, unhelpfully, doesn\u2019t provide an opinion either way. But he stays asleep as Wei Wuxian uses his only free hand to carefully tease the pins out of his hair, then the ornament, and finally finger combs it smooth onto pillow.</p>\n<p>If he falls asleep with his head on Lan Zhan\u2019s chest, it\u2019s just because he\u2019s in the middle of undoing a knot at the end of his hair when his eyes slide shut.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren looks from the pile of work he still has to get done, to the candle nubs he typically works by at night to keep anyone from seeing the light in the window, and sighs before reaching for a new piece of paper.</p>\n<p>At some point, Wei Wuxian and Wangji are going to sort themselves out.</p>\n<p>When they do, he figures it\u2019ll be best if they already have the details of an arrangement sorted out.</p>\n<p>He starts another letter to Cangse Sanren and Wei Changze, forgoes any of the gossiping and gambling that he absolutely does not partake in, and gets straight to the point of opening negotiations for a possible marriage contract.</p>\n<p>If Wangji had to pick absolutely anyone to fall in love with, Lan Qiren can admit, at least to himself, that he\u2019s glad it was Wei Wuxian.</p>"
