  "text": "<p>Milena wakes up on her third morning as part of the White Wolf\u2019s court to a gentle knocking at her chamber door. It\u2019s not long after dawn - the light through her new room\u2019s shuttered window is still grey and dim - and she\u2019s still a little bleary from last night, but if someone\u2019s knocking, it\u2019s probably important.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a lad in the plain clothing of the keep\u2019s servants, who grins up at her and says, \u201cBard Jaskier invites you to join him in the hot springs, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even if Jaskier weren\u2019t her friend, such an invitation would be priceless. The White Wolf\u2019s <em>Consort</em> inviting her to...well, anything...is a compliment no noblewoman could possibly turn down. Even if what he\u2019s inviting her to is the absolutely scandalous shared baths of Kaer Morhen.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him I am delighted to do so,\u201d she asks the lad, and closes the door to survey her new rooms in a bit of a panic. She has toweling in the chest at the foot of the bed - she saw it last night when she was looking for spare quilts, as Kaer Morhen is <em>cold</em> even in midsummer - but what does one wear to join a Warlord\u2019s Consort in the <em>baths</em>?</p>\n<p>...Nothing at all, presumably. <em>Getting</em> there, though, is going to be cold.</p>\n<p>She puts on her heaviest dressing gown and makes a bundle of toweling and the day\u2019s clothing, and ventures down through the twisting corridors, feet almost noiseless in thick fur slippers - a gift from Jaskier, as it happens. He\u2019s waiting for her at the entrance to the baths, wearing a dressing gown much like her own, with a swatch of toweling thrown over his shoulder and a bright smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d he says, bowing her into the vast cavern ahead of him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be fine. Nobody will give you any trouble, I promise, and it\u2019s not crowded at this time of day. No Witchers at all.\u201d He winks. \u201cIf you want to see Lambert naked, you\u2019ll have to come back again later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena feels her cheeks go very hot. \u201cYou\u2019re <em>dreadful</em>,\u201d she says faintly. Lambert is a very handsome man, and she would almost certainly not be able to look at him <em>naked</em> without dying of embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I am,\u201d Jaskier says, chuckling.</p>\n<p>Milena follows him over to one of the warmer pools, where two women are already soaking. One is Triss Merigold, who has already proven to be quite kind when not irritated - she is a delightful tablemate, far more pleasant than Marta ever was. The <em>other</em> is the absolutely terrifying Lady Yennefer. They both smile at Jaskier as he puts his towel down beside the pool, strips off his dressing gown - Milena hastily averts her eyes - and slides into the water.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd have you been thoroughly claimed, little flower?\u201d Lady Yennefer asks Jaskier with a wicked smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d says Jaskier, sounding <em>astonishingly</em> pleased with himself. \u201cAnd when have you ever known Geralt to skimp on his duties?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially not when they\u2019re so pleasant,\u201d Lady Yennefer says, chuckling, and then looks up at Milena where she\u2019s dithering on the side of the pool. \u201cOh, come on in, girl, I won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena swallows hard and puts her bundle down, and firmly pretends she\u2019s the only person in the room as she takes off her dressing gown and steps down into the water. Jaskier, bless the man, looks the other way politely, not looking back at her until she\u2019s submerged up to her shoulders. The water is not exactly <em>cloudy</em>, but it\u2019s mineral-rich and opaque enough that she can pretend she\u2019s wearing a particular daring gown and not just - naked. In public.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was the library, the other night?\u201d Triss asks her.</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s cheeks flush again. \u201cIt\u2019s a very nice library,\u201d she says. It <em>is</em> quite a nice library, large and well-cared-for, even if most of the books in it are about war or monsters. She wasn\u2019t there for the <em>books</em>. She was there because Lambert had invited her, and she would have gone almost <em>anywhere</em> he\u2019d asked when he gave her such a hopeful look as he had.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was <em>Lambert</em>?\u201d Jaskier asks, and Milena puts both hands over her bright red cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a perfect gentleman,\u201d she says, knowing her voice is squeaky with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur Lambert, a gentleman?\u201d Lady Yennefer drawls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Milena allows, \u201che only swore every <em>third</em> word or so. And he <em>did</em> offer me his arm, and said my dress looked nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lady Yennefer\u2019s perfect eyebrows go up. \u201cAlright,\u201d she says, sounding a little taken aback. \u201cI stand corrected. For Lambert, that <em>is</em> being a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you asked him about dagger lessons yet?\u201d Jaskier asks. Milena glances over at him, and sees that he\u2019s not looking at her at all, eyes closed as he soaps up his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet. It\u2019s been...a bit hectic since you suggested it,\u201d Milena admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, just a little stabbing, our Wolf intimidating the entire court of Temeria, a brawl, and then our little songbird being named Consort to the Warlord of the North,\u201d Triss says, grinning. \u201cPractically a quiet week!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDownright boring,\u201d Lady Yennefer says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking as the person who got stabbed <em>and</em> got proposed to, I take offense at that,\u201d Jaskier says, and submerges to rinse his hair. Lady Yennefer chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re to be the little menace\u2019s lady-in-waiting,\u201d she says to Milena.</p>\n<p>Milena nods. Triss hands her a bar of scented soap - very nicely scented rosewater, in fact - and she starts to wash, trying hard not to slosh the water too much and splash her neighbors. \u201cThe Warlord was pleased to allow me to serve her,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get used to calling him something else,\u201d Jaskier says, shaking the water out of his hair and lounging back against Lady Yennefer\u2019s shoulder. She sniffs like she\u2019s offended, but she also curls an arm around his shoulders and scritches her nails through his hair gently. \u201cHe\u2019s not terribly fond of that title.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>should</em> I call him?\u201d Milena asks, swallowing hard. She can\u2019t just call him <em>Geralt</em>. Even if she\u2019s sworn herself to him, he\u2019s still <em>far</em> too intimidating to call by his bare <em>name</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhite Wolf is fine,\u201d Jaskier says, closing his eyes and making a pleased humming noise. He looks very relaxed. Milena can\u2019t imagine how he manages to be so fearless around so many <em>terrifying</em> people. \u201cOr just <em>the</em> Wolf. I called him \u2018my lord\u2019 for most of a year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then Eskel tells me you called him \u2018my Geralt\u2019 instead,\u201d Triss says, winking at Milena. Jaskier\u2019s eyes fly open and he flails, splashing all of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he says, \u201cthat was a <em>slip of the tongue</em>, ooh, when I get my hands on Eskel -!\u201d</p>\n<p>Triss and Lady Yennefer are both laughing, and Milena finds herself giggling too. \u201cYou\u2019ll what,\u201d Lady Yennefer teases, \u201cadmit that everyone else knew you two were in love <em>well</em> before you ever noticed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Jaskier says, crossing his arms over his chest and pouting ostentatiously. \u201cYou\u2019re dreadful and I don\u2019t know why I like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like us <em>because</em> we\u2019re dreadful,\u201d Triss says. \u201cExcept Milena, I suppose. Are you dreadful, lass?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot usually,\u201d Milena says. \u201cI...could learn?\u201d Because oh, it looks like so much <em>fun</em>, this easy teasing, this happy camaraderie. She\u2019s only a duke\u2019s third daughter, youngest and least-regarded, nothing like as exalted as a sorceress or the Warlord\u2019s own chosen consort, but she\u2019d like to be properly part of this, if she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Triss says, giving her a warm smile. \u201cGot to have teeth to survive in this court, lass, but so long as you have \u2018em, no one will give you too much trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Milena says. In Redania\u2019s court, a duke\u2019s third daughter who dared to have <em>opinions</em>, much less be <em>snippy</em>, was one who would swiftly find herself married off to a particularly odious nobleman and sequestered at his estate...but she\u2019s not in Redania anymore. As Princess Cirilla\u2019s lady-in-waiting, she can\u2019t be married without the princess\u2019s permission - and everyone in Kaer Morhen seems to <em>know</em> that Lambert is courting her, or at least thinking about starting to court her, and to at the very least be willing to see how that goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYou\u2019ve steel in your spine, and you\u2019re clever enough to see past all of Lambert\u2019s...Lambert-ness to the good man underneath. It took <em>me</em> months and months to get my feet properly under me. Don\u2019t worry if it takes you a little while, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena smiles gratefully at him. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you being uncomfortable here,\u201d she admits. \u201cYou\u2019re so happy, and you <em>fit</em> so well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I was scared out of my wits when I got here,\u201d Jaskier admits, shrugging. Lady Yennefer wrinkles her nose and nods agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you were going to faint at the Wolf\u2019s feet,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cBelieve me, no one was more surprised than I was that I managed to keep my wits about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTakes more than Geralt glowering to render <em>you</em> witless, bard,\u201d Triss says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, these days he does it by smiling,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cOr -\u201d he glances at Milena and doesn\u2019t finish the sentence, but by the way he wiggles his eyebrows he was thinking something <em>truly</em> filthy. Lady Yennefer snorts a surprisingly inelegant laugh, and Triss giggles so hard she slips briefly underwater. Milena resigns herself to the fact that living in Kaer Morhen is going to involve being embarrassed a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth it.</p>\n<p>She follows Jaskier and Triss and Lady Yennefer to breakfast, which is an extremely informal meal in this odd place, and then Jaskier beckons her to follow him up to Princess Ciri\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>The young princess is...almost as disconcerting as her imposing father, honestly. Milena has heard her referred to more than once as \u2018little menace,\u2019 and it seems like a good moniker for a girl who delights in pranks and practical jokes, and also can perform feats of acrobatics and weapons prowess that would challenge most of the trained, adult warriors Milena has ever met. She\u2019s not much like any other princess in the world.</p>\n<p>Then again, if she <em>were</em> much like any other princess, she\u2019d be <em>miserable</em> in Kaer Morhen, so it\u2019s probably just as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cMornings, I teach Ciri anything academic I can get her to sit still for,\u201d Jaskier says as they climb up and up and <em>up</em> the spiral stairs to the princess\u2019s room. \u201cHistory, geography, maths, a little bit of music theory, court etiquette, anything else that comes up. She\u2019s <em>very</em> bright, but sitting still is not her favorite thing in the world. Afternoons, she has training with Eskel and Vesemir and Geralt for weapons, and then they turn her over to Yen and Triss for magical stuff. I stay <em>well</em> out of that, and I advise you do the same. She\u2019s not got perfect control yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no magical talent whatsoever,\u201d Milena says. \u201cIs anyone teaching her embroidery, or painting, or penmanship? What other languages does she speak?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>that</em> is why you\u2019re going to be useful,\u201d Jaskier says, beaming. \u201cI don\u2019t entirely know what noble<em>women</em> learn. She <em>does</em> have a decent grasp of Elder Speech and Nilfgaardian, and can swear in Skelliger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena giggles despite herself. \u201cLet me guess - Lambert?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier winks. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI speak decent Nilfgaardian, so I can practice that with her,\u201d Milena offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cLovely!\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIf you want to try to teach her embroidery, be my guest, but I suspect you\u2019ll have more luck if you point out that tidy sewing will be useful for patching up injuries. She\u2019s a bloodthirsty little thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRuns in the family?\u201d Milena offers.</p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, actually,\u201d he says. \u201cGeralt\u2019s <em>not</em> bloodthirsty, is the thing. He kills monsters because they\u2019re dangers to other people, but given the choice, he wouldn\u2019t raise a hand against <em>anyone</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena pauses on the landing and blinks at him, trying <em>desperately</em> to make that sentence make sense. The Warlord of the North, the White Wolf, the terror of the continent, the man whose unstoppable inhuman armies strike fear into the hearts of monarchs from Skellige to Zerrikania, Poviss to Nilfgaard\u2026</p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t like to kill?</p>\n<p>But then...he hasn\u2019t joined any of the brawls in the great hall - hasn\u2019t even seemed to want to. He\u2019s never less than gentle with Princess Ciri, or with Jaskier, and his interactions with his warriors are <em>friendly</em>, bluff and cheerful as a basket of playful wolf cubs. He <em>does</em> spar with people out on the training grounds, and beats them, too, but that\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s <em>duty</em>, isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s his <em>job</em> to be the finest warrior in the world. But aside from that one elk, on that dreadful hunting trip, Milena\u2019s never seen the White Wolf actually <em>kill</em> anything, and the elk died swiftly and as painlessly as possible, and moreover was <em>food</em>, not a trophy slain merely for bragging rights.</p>\n<p>Several things rearrange themselves in her head, like puzzle pieces that have been put in all wrong and need to be flipped around until they fit.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s known Jaskier was really and truly in love for a while, and she\u2019s heard him say a dozen times and more that he considers the White Wolf <em>magnificent</em>, but it\u2019s still been baffling, how someone as lively and cheerful as Jaskier could fall for such a gruff, glowering, <em>threatening</em> man. But if the White Wolf is\u2026</p>\n<p>Is <em>gentle</em>. Is as kind as Jaskier is - kinder, maybe, Milena has no illusions about how much of a nasty streak Jaskier conceals under the sweet smiles, though he only unleashes it at people who have truly wronged him or those he considers his - and as <em>good</em> as Jaskier\u2019s songs insist. If he is, indeed, <em>magnificent</em>\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, Jaskier\u2019s obvious adoration makes a lot more sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe learned it from Lady Yennefer, then,\u201d Milena says, keeping her voice carefully light, and Jaskier laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you might have something there,\u201d he says, and pulls open the princess\u2019s door.</p>\n<p>Watching Jaskier teach is enlightening. He\u2019s a <em>good</em> teacher, though Milena rather expected that: clear and gentle and willing to explain things over and over in different ways until Princess Ciri truly understands. He also very clearly <em>adores</em> the girl, as much as if she were his daughter - more, maybe, than most nobles love their children.</p>\n<p>He pulls Milena in, too, and Princess Ciri seems delighted to have someone else to practice Nilfgaardian with and to help her puzzle over her maths. Milena <em>likes</em> maths - a good trait for a noble daughter, given that she\u2019s always expected she\u2019d have to run a household someday - and manages to coax Princess Ciri into being interested in a particularly thorny problem by talking about how many yards of cloth and thread are needed to make a dress, and working from there. Princess Ciri apparently has <em>never</em> sewn a dress. Milena shows her the difference between seamwork and embroidery, using the hem and decoration of her own dress as examples, and Princess Ciri asks dozens of questions so rapidly Milena can barely keep up, and Jaskier sits back and grins at both of them and hums little snatches of melody now and again.</p>\n<p>They go down to dinner together with Princess Ciri <em>still</em> asking questions nineteen to the dozen, but when they get to the table, Jaskier pauses, looking taken aback.</p>\n<p>Milena eyes the high table, wondering what has startled him. It looks much as it always does -</p>\n<p>Ah. No. Eskel is <em>already</em> at the table, and he\u2019s sitting one chair <em>away</em> from the White Wolf\u2019s tall seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>,\u201d Jaskier squeaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t gotten the double-wide chair made yet,\u201d Eskel says, smirking. \u201c<em>Consort</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d says Jaskier. \u201cYou. I.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena exchanges a look with Princess Ciri, who is clearly having just as much trouble not laughing as Milena herself is.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Eskel says, almost gently. It\u2019s hard to reconcile this patient, even-tempered man with the snarling wolf who threw the noblewomen out of Kaer Morhen not two days past. \u201cOur Wolf will be happier if you\u2019re within arm\u2019s reach, and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier sits down. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d he says, very faintly.</p>\n<p>Eskel shakes his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking my place.\u201d His smile gets a little toothy. \u201cWe\u2019re just keeping you safe between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier gets a <em>very</em> strange look on his face and nods. \u201cAlright then. I guess I can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel gives Ciri a conspiratorial half-smile. \u201cJaskier, if there is one thing I have learned since you got here, it\u2019s that you can argue with <em>anything</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cOh, fuck you,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>Milena curtsies to Ciri and retreats to her own chair, further down the table. Jaskier and Eskel can hash that out on their own, and she\u2019s not <em>quite</em> feeling up to facing the White Wolf today. He may be her new liege lord and her princess\u2019s father and a truly noble man, but he\u2019s also <em>really</em> intimidating.</p>\n<p>Someday, maybe, she\u2019ll be able to jest with him as the sorceresses do. But not today.</p>\n<p>Lambert finishes his dinner <em>far</em> too quickly, and then sits there contemplating his ale mug until Eskel snorts and elbows him - gently, for Witchers - and says, \u201cGo on, then. She keeps looking at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe what?\u201d Lambert says, and instantly regrets it. He peers down the table, past Eskel and Buttercup and Geralt and the cub and Yennefer and Vesemir and everyone, and sure enough, Milena is peeking <em>up</em> the table, face half hidden behind a goblet of wine - oh, interesting, Yennefer must like her, that\u2019s new - and her cheeks go pink when she sees Lambert looking, and she ducks her head like she really was just taking a drink.</p>\n<p>And then she puts her goblet down and looks up again, shy and nervous, and meets his eyes, and blushes <em>worse</em>, and smiles.</p>\n<p>Lambert falls back in his chair like he\u2019s just been kicked in the chest by a mule. (An experience he has, regrettably, actually <em>had</em>. Mules are bastards.) <em>Fuck</em>, she\u2019s so - she\u2019s so fucking <em>sweet</em>, what\u2019s she doing smiling at a miserable asshole like him?</p>\n<p>Eskel props his chin on a fist and gives Lambert a thoughtful look. \u201cDamn,\u201d he says after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Lambert says, mostly on instinct.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks, you\u2019re not my taste at all,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cApparently you\u2019re Milena\u2019s, though, gods know why. She\u2019s got nothing to do this afternoon. You should do something about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Lambert says again, and gets up. What - what the fuck should he <em>say</em>?</p>\n<p>Buttercup leans back and taps his elbow as he goes by. \u201cWant some advice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert nods. He doesn\u2019t <em>think</em> Buttercup will fuck with him. Not about this. Buttercup\u2019s got a perfectly good mean streak, but only when someone\u2019s <em>earned</em> it.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo suggestions,\u201d Buttercup says. \u201cShe got moved to a new room; you could ask if she needs anything - furniture moved, that sort of thing.\u201d Lambert nods. Moving furniture is easy. Or he could show her where the big communal linen cupboards are, if she needs more quilts or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr, if you <em>really</em> want to get her attention, offer to teach her to use a dagger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert gapes. \u201cShe - but - <em>me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with Ciri,\u201d Geralt offers. There\u2019s a smile lurking around his mouth, but he\u2019s <em>not</em> teasing, which is so kind it makes Lambert want to hit something.</p>\n<p>The cub nods enthusiastically. \u201cYou\u2019re a <em>good</em> teacher, Uncle Lambert!\u201d she says, and then grins, bright and fierce. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be nice to Milena, \u2018cause she\u2019s my lady-in-waiting and I gotta protect her. But I bet she\u2019d like it if you taught her daggers. And she could teach you something! She\u2019s going to teach <em>me</em> embroidery.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s...a lot of information, right there. \u201cDunno if I want to learn embroidery, cub,\u201d Lambert says, because that\u2019s the safest bit of that whole pile of words.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Buttercup says, and hides a grin (badly) behind his hand. Yennefer snorts into her wine goblet.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Lambert tells them, and adds to the cub, \u201cI\u2019ll be nice. Or. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the cub agrees, nodding. Lambert heads down the table before that conversation can turn into even <em>more</em> of a clusterfuck. If this is how <em>Buttercup</em> felt when they were all betting on when Geralt was finally going to fuck him, Lambert suddenly has a <em>lot</em> more sympathy for the man.</p>\n<p>Milena looks up and smiles when he reaches her, and rises. She\u2019s so fucking <em>dainty</em>. Her head barely comes to his shoulder, and he could span her waist with his hands. <em>Her</em> hands are slender and elegant and she\u2019s got rings on half of her fingers - little silver things, delicate and pretty - and her dark hair is braided in some sort of elaborate pattern that Lambert couldn\u2019t recreate if he tried, with a ribbon threaded through it that catches the light. She smells like roses. It\u2019s very distracting.</p>\n<p>Teach her to <em>fight</em>? Are they all insane? He\u2019d fucking <em>break</em> her!</p>\n<p>...Though he\u2019s never actually hurt the cub. If he just treated her like she\u2019s as small as the cub is...which she almost <em>is</em>, Ciri\u2019s a tall child and Milena\u2019s <em>not</em> a tall woman...it could maybe work?</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d he says, and runs out of words that aren\u2019t <em>fuck</em> or possibly <em>help</em>.</p>\n<p>Milena cocks her head at him curiously. \u201cHave you perchance a free afternoon?\u201d she asks. Lambert nods mutely. She blushes, but she meets his eyes squarely. \u201cMight you wish to - ah - spend it in my company? Perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert nods again, far too eagerly. Fuck, why can\u2019t he <em>talk</em>? \u201cButtercup said,\u201d he says, and stops, because <em>fuck</em>, does she even know who he means?</p>\n<p>\u201cButtercup?\u201d Milena asks, and then giggles. It\u2019s fucking <em>adorable</em>. Lambert is not used to thinking of things as <em>adorable</em>. Adorable is for - for children talking about bunnies, or something like that. But Milena is adorable. Fuck it. \u201cDo you call Jaskier \u2018buttercup\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. \u201cYes,\u201d Lambert says, and Milena giggles again, hiding it behind a hand, and blessedly doesn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSaid you - I could - daggers?\u201d Fuck, he\u2019s a <em>lot</em> more eloquent than this, really he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Milena says, lovely dark eyes going wide. \u201cI would very much like to learn to use a dagger, if you wanted to teach me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Huh. That...was a lot easier than Lambert thought it would be. He offers her his arm, because that seemed to please her when they went up to the library the other night, and she tucks her delicate little hand into the crook of his elbow and smiles up at him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an indoor training salle that doesn\u2019t get used much - Witchers like to train outside unless it\u2019s <em>truly</em> unbearable - so he leads her that way. They\u2019re halfway there when he looks down at her slender hands and realizes <em>his</em> daggers will be far too unwieldy. Armory, then. They must have <em>something</em> small enough.</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s eyes go wide when he opens the door to the armory. \u201cThat is...a lot of swords,\u201d she says faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lambert agrees, and heads for the racks of daggers. The smaller ones - the ones for the younger trainees - are near the front. Most of them are <em>still</em> probably too heavy for her; Lambert doesn\u2019t know if dukes\u2019 daughters get any sort of strength training, but he\u2019s guessing no. But there\u2019s a couple sets that various Witchers have brought back just because they were <em>pretty</em>; especially Crane Witchers, who really ought to be called <em>Magpie</em> Witchers if you ask Lambert, with the way they tend to pick up shiny things and bring them home.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says, plucking one slender knife off the rack and holding it out hilt-first. \u201cIs this too heavy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena takes it warily, like she\u2019s worried it\u2019s going to bite. Lambert shakes his head and reaches out to adjust her grip so the knife won\u2019t just fall out of her hand the first time she does <em>anything</em>, and realizes rather belatedly that he\u2019s just <em>touched</em> her, skin to skin, when he\u2019s already got his hand wrapped around hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, ears burning. Her skin is very soft, and her hand is so much <em>smaller</em> than his.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Milena says, blushing just as hard as he is. \u201cIs this - how I should hold it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s horrid, treacherous brain provides him with a <em>completely different</em> context in which she could be asking that, and he wonders if it\u2019s too late to just throw himself off the Trail and pretend he never passed his Trials. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, sounding rather strangled to his own ears. \u201cYou want to grip tight enough you won\u2019t drop it, but not so tight as your fingers cramp up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Milena says. Lambert is still holding her hand. He lets go as if burnt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it too heavy?\u201d he asks again.</p>\n<p>Milena hefts the dagger thoughtfully, fingers curled in a much better grip now. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Lambert says, and grabs the matching one off the rack. \u201cWe\u2019ll - I can get you sheaths for those. If they work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods. \u201cShould I -\u201d she says, pauses, frowns a little - oh no, the little crease in her forehead and the way her <em>nose</em> wrinkles, it\u2019s not <em>fair</em> - \u201cAt home, I think the guards trained with blunt weapons, or wooden ones. Should I\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert...honestly hadn\u2019t thought of that, because Witchers <em>don\u2019t</em> use practice weapons. They train with live steel. But Milena isn\u2019t a <em>Witcher</em>, and if <em>she</em> gets hurt, she won\u2019t heal in minutes the way Lambert would. \u201cI\u2019ll use a stick,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d Fuck, the idea of drawing blood - no. <em>Fuck</em> no. Every Witcher in the keep is still recovering from the horrid smell of <em>Buttercup\u2019s</em> blood; Lambert sure as fuck won\u2019t be adding <em>Milena\u2019s</em> to that.</p>\n<p>Milena blinks up at him. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t worried about me hitting <em>you</em>,\u201d she says after a moment, with a little smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you probably won\u2019t,\u201d Lambert says, quite honestly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll heal. I mean, unless you get <em>really</em> lucky and hit an artery or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should very much prefer not to do that,\u201d Milena says, looking a little ill at the thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hit me,\u201d Lambert assures her. \u201cI mean. To start with it\u2019s all drills anyhow. You won\u2019t actually be <em>trying</em> to stab me for a while. Unless I fuck up, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena giggles, which is better than looking ill. \u201cAlright,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert nods, and leads her down the corridor to the training salle. It\u2019s a big room, and empty except for the two of them; everyone else is outside. Lambert doesn\u2019t particularly want an audience for this, though. Heckling would be...he would probably lose his temper and punch someone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, putting the spare knife down on one of the benches. \u201cSo. First thing. Don\u2019t stab yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena blinks at him for a moment, and then, slowly, <em>grins</em>. It\u2019s broad and sweet and <em>oh fuck</em> but she\u2019s beautiful. What else can he say that will make her smile like that? He didn\u2019t <em>mean</em> for that to be a joke - it\u2019s one of the things Vesemir tells the trainees - but if she\u2019s going to <em>smile</em> at him -</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pointy end goes in the other person?\u201d she asks. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m told, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s <em>jesting</em> with him, and smiling. Fuck. Lambert has to clear his throat before he can respond properly. \u201cYeah, the - the pointy end goes in the other guy. Very important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods. Lambert swallows. \u201cSecond thing is, is stance,\u201d he says. \u201cBalance. If you get knocked over, that\u2019s not good. So. Like this.\u201d He plants his feet the way every Witcher is taught, so that he can move in any direction easily, knees slightly bent, ready for action. They learn this well before the Trials, well before they\u2019re ever given live steel to play with: stand just so, move this way, quick and agile and balanced, because if you get knocked over, it\u2019s fucking hard to get up again before whatever\u2019s trying to kill you gets a chance to finish the job.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to tell if Milena has the stance right, what with her skirts and all. This would be easier if she wasn\u2019t wearing them.</p>\n<p>If she was wearing <em>trousers</em>. Not if she was. If she was.</p>\n<p>Lambert puts his face in his hands and curses quietly. Fuck his <em>brain</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d Milena asks. She smells concerned. She <em>looks</em> concerned, when Lambert peeks out between his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m. Fine.\u201d Lambert says, and hauls his mind back onto <em>dagger training</em> with an effort. \u201cRight. So. If you stand like this, you can go forward or back or sideways easily, see?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena watches him carefully, and then tries to imitate him. After a moment she frowns, and puts the knife down on the bench, and hikes up her skirts a little, and <em>oh fuck</em> Lambert can see her <em>ankles</em>.</p>\n<p>Lambert has <em>actually fucked whores</em>, alright, he is a grown Witcher and has been on the Path for <em>decades</em> and knows what a naked woman looks like and he should not be <em>completely distracted</em> by the sight of a pair of slender ankles in pretty blue silk stockings. Fuck.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re really nice ankles, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she asks, and Lambert crouches down so he can see properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeft foot a little more turned out,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cAnd bend your knees a little more. Yeah. Like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena tries a couple of steps - forwards, backwards, left, right. \u201cOh!\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like dancing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...guess it is,\u201d Lambert says, thinking about Buttercup teaching them how to do courtly dances before that trip to Redania. The stance <em>is</em> a little similar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that helps,\u201d Milena says, and shifts her weight a little, and <em>now</em> she\u2019s moving properly, fluid and easy. \u201cI like dancing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert stands up. \u201cThen think of it like dancing, but with knives,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd. Well. Stabbing your partner, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have had a fair number of dancing partners I would have preferred to stab,\u201d Milena says thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully not me yet,\u201d Lambert says. He\u2019s danced with her a dozen times now, to Buttercup\u2019s pretty music, and she\u2019s always <em>seemed</em> happy about it - has asked <em>him</em> to dance, in fact, and more than once at that. She wouldn\u2019t have done that if she didn\u2019t want to, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not you,\u201d Milena says. \u201c<em>You</em> are not a handsy lecher three times my age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Lambert says, frowning. \u201cI probably <em>am</em> at least three times your age.\u201d That\u2019s bad, right? That\u2019s probably bad.</p>\n<p>Milena blinks at him. \u201cReally? You don\u2019t look it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitchers don\u2019t age much,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d he does some quick math in his head; he lost count a while back, since it doesn\u2019t come up much. \u201cEighty-something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena cocks her head and considers him thoughtfully. \u201cMore like four times my age, then,\u201d she says at last. \u201cStill not a handsy lecher, though, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re on the lookout for a third wife to care for you in your dotage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck, Lambert hates everything about that sentence and what it implies about Redania\u2019s court. \u201cNot anywhere near my dotage,\u201d he says at last. \u201cGot another few hundred years to go at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s eyebrows go up. \u201c...How old is Master <em>Vesemir</em>?\u201d she asks at last.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d Lambert shrugs. \u201cThree hundred, something like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGracious,\u201d Milena says. \u201cWell. Alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo fighting\u2019s a little like dancing,\u201d Lambert says, attempting desperately to get this conversation back to something a little less uncomfortable than the reminder that Milena is so fucking <em>young</em>, and sweet, and what is she doing smiling like that at a prickly asshole like <em>him</em> anyway? \u201cSo. Um. Try and - try and keep the distance between us the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena frowns a little, brow furrowing in concentration - oh no, <em>that\u2019s</em> adorable too - and nods. Lambert steps forward, and she steps back, keeping her balance easily. Forward, back, left, right, varying the distance and the direction at random, Lambert leads her around the salle, and she keeps her eyes on his chest - <em>good</em>, that\u2019s where she <em>should</em> watch, where the first sign will be if he moves his arms - and matches him, stepping light and easy the way she does on the dance floor.</p>\n<p>He stops when her heartrate starts to kick up to what he\u2019s pretty sure is a little too fast, and there\u2019s little beads of sweat along her hairline. She kept up, though. She kept up really fucking well.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood job,\u201d he says, and her cheeks go pink. \u201cNext time, holding the knife. Just to get used to the weight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she says, smiling up at him. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re such a good dancer, if you learned to do <em>this</em> first.\u201d</p>\n<p>She thinks he\u2019s a good dancer. She <em>likes</em> dancing with him. Lambert\u2019s ears are burning again. \u201cIf dancing\u2019s got anything to do with fighting, you\u2019ll be pretty good with knives,\u201d he offers, hoping desperately that it comes across as the compliment he means it to be. He\u2019s not <em>used</em> to giving compliments.</p>\n<p>Milena gives him such a sweet smile he thinks his heart might stop. \u201cWhy thank you,\u201d she says, all courtly poise and delicacy. Fuck, what <em>is</em> she doing spending time with a coarse fucker like him?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s selfish enough not to <em>ask</em>, because then she might realize what a bad idea it is. But he really, really wants to know why - why she\u2019s <em>here</em>, in this cold dark keep, talking to him, learning from him, dancing with him, <em>flirting</em> with him, when she\u2019s so clearly <em>made</em> for southern courts and delicate courtship and the sort of soft-handed noble sons who never learn to use a sword heavier than a rapier and even <em>that</em> only for show.</p>\n<p>Not a Witcher with hard-callused hands and scars too numerous to count and a temper like a short-fuse bomb and a vocabulary <em>far</em> more suited to the gutter.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll figure that out soon enough. Until then, Lambert\u2019s a bad enough person to hoard her smiles and the touch of her delicate hands on his arms, and the way she leans into his touch when they dance, and the soothing rose scent of her perfume.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you walk me to my rooms?\u201d she asks, and Lambert offers her his arm and scoops up the daggers as they pass the bench, and escorts her up to her new rooms just like a real gentleman, although presumably a real gentleman wouldn\u2019t spend the entire walk thinking about tucking his nose into the crook of her neck and inhaling the smell of roses and salt-sweat, maybe even stealing a tiny lick, just so he\u2019d know what her skin <em>tastes</em> like.</p>\n<p>She opens the door to her rooms and turns back with a tiny frown. \u201cWould you - I know every skill <em>I</em> have probably seems very silly, here in Kaer Morhen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if there <em>was</em> something you\u2019d like to learn, I\u2019d be happy to - to trade lessons, so I don\u2019t feel so much as though I\u2019m imposing on your kindness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot an imposition,\u201d Lambert says, and he <em>means</em> to say he doesn\u2019t need any sort of lessons - certainly not <em>embroidery</em>, no matter what the cub thinks - but his gaze snags on her elaborate braids again. \u201cMaybe - this?\u201d he says, and reaches out, and touches her shining hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis?\u201d Milena says, reaching up to bring her braid around and blinking at it. \u201cOh! Braiding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert nods. Fuck, it\u2019s a <em>stupid</em> thing to ask, she\u2019s going to be - horrified, or offended, or something -</p>\n<p>\u201cI would be delighted,\u201d Milena says, smiling that broad sweet smile again. \u201cShall we plan to train again tomorrow? You could - help me put my hair up before we start?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lambert says, too fast, too eager, but she keeps smiling, and she <em>smells</em> happy, bright and joyful like summer flowers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and Lambert nods, and she slips into her rooms and closes the door, and he realizes he\u2019s still holding the daggers.</p>\n<p>Well. Alright. He\u2019ll go and get sheaths made for them, then. And then he can give them to her tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Oh <em>fuck</em>, if she\u2019s teaching him to braid, he\u2019s going to be touching her <em>hair</em>. That. Oh. Oh <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so very fucked, indeed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, how was your afternoon?\u201d Triss asks as Milena sits down for supper, and then chuckles when Milena blushes. \u201cThat good, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was delightful,\u201d Milena says, stubbornly ignoring her own flushed cheeks. \u201cLambert was the very model of a gentleman, and I learned a great deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>did</em> you,\u201d Triss says, and waggles her eyebrows outrageously. Milena squeaks and covers her face with her hands, ears burning.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like <em>that</em>!\u201d she says desperately.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, lass, you are <em>far</em> too sweet,\u201d Triss says, patting her on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s quite adorable, really. And I\u2019ve never seen Lambert so flustered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Milena asks. He\u2019s <em>eighty-something</em>, surely he\u2019s had flirtations before. Though admittedly he <em>did</em> seem rather...out of his depth, perhaps. At least until they started training properly; <em>then</em> he relaxed and stopped looking quite so flustered.</p>\n<p><em>Eighty-something</em>. She wouldn\u2019t have guessed he was more than thirty. Which would <em>still</em> be more than a decade her senior, but - <em>eighty-something</em>, really? Which must mean the White Wolf is that old, too, since she thinks she\u2019s heard he\u2019s <em>older</em> than Lambert, and Eskel\u2019s the same age as the White Wolf, and Master Vesemir is <em>three hundred</em> at least\u2026</p>\n<p>She feels very young, and very small, and very alone all of a sudden. She\u2019s older than the <em>princess</em>, but the princess has been in Kaer Morhen all her life, and is perfectly suited to the keep; and Jaskier is only a <em>little</em> older than she is, but he couldn\u2019t be better matched to this place and these people if it had been <em>designed</em> that way. And she is not a bard, not a Witcher-raised princess, not a sorceress, just - just a noblewoman, meant to be decorative and dainty and <em>delicate</em>. What is she doing here? How could she ever have been so arrogant as to think she could fit in, could earn herself a place among these - these <em>demigods</em> and heroes?</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, lass, you\u2019ve gone white as a sheet,\u201d Triss says gently. \u201cAre you well? <em>Did</em> Lambert do something to harm you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that!\u201d Milena says at once. \u201cHe really <em>was</em> a perfect gentleman, I swear it. I just. I\u2019m not sure why Eskel let me <em>stay</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Triss makes a thoughtful sound and reaches for the basket of bread rolls, taking one and breaking it open and buttering it before she responds. \u201cWell, first off, because Jaskier asked,\u201d she says. \u201cDo him good to have a friend, and both Eskel and Geralt would happily fetch him the stars if he asked for them. And the little menace <em>does</em> need someone around who can help her learn <em>courtly</em> things, because otherwise she\u2019ll grow up as feral as her father, and she has to be able to at least <em>fake</em> courtesy when she\u2019s older. But the meat of it, lass, is you swore to the Wolf and you meant it. Witchers <em>can</em> smell lies. Wolf\u2019s not got so many allies as we can afford to toss one aside, you know.\u201d She gives Milena a long look. \u201cHaving second thoughts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a burden,\u201d Milena says quietly. \u201cTo be - to be <em>useless</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d Triss says, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re clever. And a lady-in-waiting\u2019s not useless at all. \u2018S just not something we\u2019ve had a lot of <em>call</em> for, up here in the north. Really just as well Jaskier thought of it; Ciri <em>needs</em> someone like you. Even if she\u2019s never a queen, she\u2019ll need to deal with court politics, and fuck knows Geralt can\u2019t teach her how to be <em>courtly</em>. And she won\u2019t be able to just scare people into submission like he does. Well. She <em>might</em>, actually, girl\u2019s going to be a <em>truly</em> powerful mage. But still. She needs the skills <em>you\u2019ve</em> got, if only so she can choose which weapon to use, eh? Like Witchers use silver <em>and</em> steel. She\u2019s already learning swords and magic. You can teach her to use <em>words</em>, you and Jaskier both.\u201d</p>\n<p>That...actually helps a great deal. It <em>is</em> something Milena can do - skills she <em>has</em>, skills that are <em>important</em> - and it has nothing to do with whether or not Lambert happens to <em>really</em> be in love with her, or if their flirtation turns into anything with time. Milena sits up a little straighter. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and Triss grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome, lass,\u201d she says, and pats Milena on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no dancing after supper that night, alas, but Jaskier <em>does</em> sing a number of very nice ballads, so Milena isn\u2019t repining. Much.</p>\n<p>Even if it <em>would</em> have been nice to dance with Lambert again.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>She\u2019s up with the dawn the next day, and meets Jaskier and Lady Yennefer and Triss down at the baths again. It\u2019s earlier than she usually likes to rise, but she\u2019ll get used to it, and it\u2019s <em>definitely</em> worth the early hour to spend time with - well, with friends, or at least people she\u2019d <em>like</em> to be friends with. Lady Yennefer might still be terrifying, but she\u2019s <em>amazing</em>, too, and Triss is very sweet, and Jaskier is - well, Jaskier <em>is</em> a friend, and a good one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould I be allowed to write to people in Redania?\u201d she asks as they\u2019re all finishing up their ablutions.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a prisoner,\u201d Triss says. \u201cThough I suppose it\u2019d be wise for someone to read through any letters just to make sure you\u2019re not accidentally giving away secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Milena agrees at once. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do any harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019d do it, but that might be a little awkward,\u201d Jaskier says, frowning a little. \u201cBeing as we\u2019re both Redanian, and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Lady Yennefer says. \u201cNobody will think <em>I\u2019m</em> letting anything through, and I can send the letters by miniature portal instead of them taking months to get across the continent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d Milena says, quite startled by the offer.</p>\n<p>Lady Yennefer smiles. \u201cI assure you it isn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI like having people owe me favors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s terrifying. Milena swallows apprehension. \u201cThere\u2019s...there\u2019s no need to put me in your debt,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cI swore myself to the Wolf, and you are his councilor and chief sorceress. Whatever you require of me, I shall do most happily.\u201d Please let that not be a very stupid promise to make. <em>Please</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Lady Yennefer says, considering her for a long moment. Her eyes are quite disconcerting; that shade of violet is unusual, and they seem to glow just a little. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned, you mean that. How the <em>fuck</em> did you survive in Redania, girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only at court for about a year,\u201d Milena says. Lady Yennefer snorts and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019ll do it; not enough time for them to beat the sincerity out of you. Fine. I\u2019ll <em>still</em> be your letter-checker, and send them for you, too, so long as you\u2019re not sending a dozen every day or something excessive like that. You can help me sort the Wolf\u2019s correspondence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be my honor,\u201d Milena says. It <em>would</em>, too: it\u2019s an astonishing mark of trust.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarly afternoons, just after dinner,\u201d Lady Yennefer says, and smiles wickedly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell Lambert he only gets you when I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena blushes. She\u2019s going to have to resign herself to just spending most of her time with her cheeks and ears bright red. \u201cI\u2019ll - I\u2019ll tell him,\u201d she squeaks.</p>\n<p>Lady Yennefer chuckles. Triss sighs and shakes her head. Jaskier snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe don\u2019t phrase it <em>quite</em> like that,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Princess Ciri is charmingly delighted to see Milena again, and greets her in perfect Nilfgaardian. Jaskier pounces on the opening, and they spend the first hour or so discussing - in Nilfgaardian - the geography and a little of the history of the southern half of the continent.</p>\n<p>When it looks like the princess is getting bored with <em>that</em>, Milena says, tentatively, \u201cWould you like to learn to sew? We could combine that with maths.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Princess Ciri asks, and Milena unfolds the length of linen she brought with her, and unrolls her sewing kit.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a lot of noble ladies, sewing a fine seam is a point of pride,\u201d she tells the little princess. \u201cWe compete with each other to see who can fit the most stitches to an inch, or make their stitches the most even, or things like that. Of course, no one <em>calls</em> it a competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause court etiquette is about being rude politely,\u201d Princess Ciri says, grinning. Milena can definitely tell why so many people in Kaer Morhen call the child the little menace. But she\u2019s not <em>wrong</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Milena says. \u201cSo. This is an ell of linen. If I can sew eight stitches to the inch, how many stitches does it take to hem an ell?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hands Princess Ciri a needle and a length of thread, and shows her how to thread the needle while the girl ponders multiplication. They get through threading a needle, tying a knot, and the most basic straight hem-stitch, and Ciri works out thread-length and fabric dimensions and pricks herself four times and uses a couple of words she <em>must</em> have learned from Lambert. It\u2019s adorable.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At dinner, Milena spends a pleasant half hour chatting with Triss about the various bases which can be used for salves. And then Lambert <em>does</em> come over, and Milena rises to greet him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining?\u201d he asks, and Milena swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mind terribly if we meet at midafternoon instead?\u201d she asks hesitantly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Lady Yennefer has a task for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert considers her carefully for a moment. \u201cNot just putting me off,\u201d he says finally, and it doesn\u2019t sound like a question, but Milena shakes her head vigorously regardless.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, <em>really</em> I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally she\u2019s not,\u201d Lady Yennefer drawls from right behind Lambert\u2019s shoulder. They both jump. \u201cAfraid I\u2019m kidnapping your lady for the next few hours. You can come collect her from my workroom at three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert bristles a bit, crossing his arms over his chest and glowering at Lady Yennefer. \u201cYou\u2019re alright with this?\u201d he asks Milena. \u201cShe didn\u2019t threaten you or anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, how sweet,\u201d Lady Yennefer says.</p>\n<p>Milena reaches out, feeling very daring, and pats Lambert\u2019s arm. \u201cNothing like that,\u201d she assures him. \u201cReally. It\u2019s fine. And I am very much looking forward to our second lesson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lambert says, a bit reluctantly. He looks down at her hand where it rests on his arm, and then, moving very slowly like he doesn\u2019t want to scare her, takes her hand in his and - hesitantly, like he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s doing it right - raises it to his lips and presses a kiss to her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019ll come find you at three.\u201d He whirls and stalks away, looking rather like a cat that just fell off a windowsill and is now pretending it <em>meant</em> to do that, all stiff dignity.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Awww</em>,\u201d Lady Yennefer says, but quietly, not mocking like it was the first time. \u201cDear girl, you\u2019ve caught yourself a Wolf, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena blinks down at her hand. Lambert\u2019s lips were very warm, and it feels like they should have left a mark, a sign that that just <em>happened</em>, but her skin is as pale and unmarked as it ever is.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome along,\u201d Lady Yennefer says, not unkindly, and ushers Milena ahead of her out of the hall.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The White Wolf gets a surprising amount of correspondence, actually. Cities and towns all over his empire send him reports, and pleas for assistance, and questions about points of law.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything that looks like it needs a Witcher goes in the box for Geralt,\u201d Lady Yennefer says briskly. \u201cMonsters, bandits, that sort of thing. Anything to do with the Wolf\u2019s laws goes to Vesemir. Eskel gets the boring reports, poor man. Political bullshit goes to Jaskier. And I get anything that requires a mage.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s simple enough, and most of the heap of parchments covering Lady Yennefer\u2019s desk <em>do</em> fit into one of those categories; Milena only has to set a few things aside for Lady Yennefer to look at more closely. They\u2019re done by two, easily, and Lady Yennefer sits back in her chair and gives Milena a thoughtful look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you want to write to?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents,\u201d Milena says. \u201cI would like to let them know <em>why</em> I\u2019ve chosen to stay. Marta won\u2019t...Marta won\u2019t explain it well.\u201d She considers. \u201cAnd I\u2019d very much like to write to Hanna and Natalia and Piotr and Dawid, my friends at court, because I think they\u2019d - I think it would be useful to the Wolf if they heard why I\u2019m staying in my <em>own</em> words, not whatever nasty rumors get spread around as soon as Marta and Karolina get back to Tretogor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what will you tell them?\u201d Lady Yennefer asks. She sounds genuinely curious, not sarcastic or cruel at all.</p>\n<p>Milena chooses her words carefully. \u201cThat...that the White Wolf\u2019s court is nothing like Tretogor. Maybe it\u2019s because Witchers can smell lies - is that too secret to include? - but everyone here is so - so straightforward.\u201d She waves a hand, trying to find the right phrases. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been in other courts, Lady Yennefer, and they\u2019re all full of - of lies, and secrets, and <em>nastiness</em>. Nobody really likes each other, and nobody really <em>trusts</em> each other, and everyone is ready to sell their own children or their own <em>selves</em> for a tiny increase in power, and most people would stab their own grandmothers if they think it\u2019ll get them a leg up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lady Yennefer snorts. \u201cYou have summed it up very accurately, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that here,\u201d Milena says. \u201cPeople here <em>like</em> each other. Even - Lambert\u2019s an <em>ass</em>, I know that, I\u2019m besotted not daft -\u201d Lady Yennefer makes a sort of gleeful inelegant noise. Milena blushes but keeps going. \u201cHe\u2019s an ass, but he\u2019s got <em>friends</em>, people who tell him he\u2019s being dreadful and who like him <em>anyhow</em>. And - in any other court, you <em>know</em> the king\u2019s right hand would be plotting, but anyone with <em>eyes</em> can see that Eskel\u2019s as loyal as a midsummer day is long; and the Warlord picked a consort he genuinely <em>loves</em> instead of someone who might have been politically advantageous, and - and I want to be part of a court where people genuinely try to do the right thing and not <em>backstab</em> each other all the time!\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s breathing a little hard when she finishes, and Lady Yennefer gives her a surprisingly sweet smile. \u201cBesotted but not daft, indeed,\u201d she says. \u201cWell. Write your letters, dear girl, and I shall see them delivered. Who knows? Maybe the next generation of Redanian nobles will model their court on the <em>Wolf\u2019s</em>. That would be a sight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe the ones who really want a court like that will come <em>here</em>,\u201d Milena says, and Lady Yennefer laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh gods, if this becomes a haven for nobles with morals, we\u2019ll lose Geralt into the mountains for a <em>month</em>,\u201d she says merrily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll what?\u201d Milena says, baffled. Lady Yennefer giggles and settles back in her chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says, \u201cEskel tells me that the very first time anyone sent Geralt tribute\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Lambert shows up at the door to Lady Yennefer\u2019s rooms promptly at three, and stands there in the doorway glowering. Lady Yennefer laughs and shoos Milena towards him. \u201cGo on, go on,\u201d she says. \u201cSame time tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena gives her a proper curtsey and a grin. Lady Yennefer is <em>still</em> terrifying, but she\u2019s sort of nice, too, and sorting correspondence <em>is</em> something Milena can help with, so it feels good to be <em>contributing</em> in some small way to the Wolf\u2019s court. And then she offers her hand to Lambert, who gives her his arm and leads her away a little faster than an easy walk.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d she says once they\u2019re a few hallways away, \u201cLady Yennefer has been nothing but kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking sorceresses,\u201d Lambert grumbles, but he slows down, too.</p>\n<p>When they get to the training salle - empty again, which Milena is glad of; she doesn\u2019t particularly want to make a fool of herself in front of anyone but Lambert - she sits down on the bench and combs her fingers through her hair, tugging it out of the loose braid she put it in that morning and parting it neatly. \u201cCome and sit,\u201d she says, and Lambert sits beside her, leaving a fair bit of space as though he\u2019s worried she\u2019ll flinch away if he comes too close. \u201cHave you braided anything before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHasn\u2019t come up,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cNot like most of us have long hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Milena says, wondering if she should encourage Jaskier to start braiding the <em>Wolf\u2019s</em> hair. It would look very pretty braided. \u201cWe\u2019ll start simple, then. Three strands. I\u2019ll do one side, you do the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lambert says, and watches her hands like - well, like a wolf watching its prey, as Milena divides one side of her hair into three thick strands and begins to weave them together, going slowly at first so he can see how it works. Lambert leans in a little closer, and Milena is <em>deeply</em> charmed to hear him muttering, very softly, \u201cOver, and over, and over...alright, that\u2019s easy enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>She finishes the braid and smiles at him. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert gulps and moves around to sit on her other side, and Milena holds very still as he <em>carefully</em> gathers her loose hair in his hands. \u201cHow...hard should I pull?\u201d he asks, sounding like he\u2019s <em>desperately</em> worried about getting it wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot very,\u201d Milena says. \u201cA little more than that...a little more...there, just like that, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lambert says, and takes a deep breath, and cards his fingers through her hair to separate it out into three sections. \u201cSo this bit goes...over that bit...how do you hang on to both bits at once?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena <em>doesn\u2019t</em> giggle. \u201cFirst two fingers and your thumb for one bit, second two fingers around the other,\u201d she says, and he fumbles for a moment, lets go of her hair and re-separates the locks, and tries again.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh</em>,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cYeah, alright, I see. This bit over <em>that</em> bit, and then <em>this</em> bit over that bit\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena sits quietly and carefully doesn\u2019t laugh when Lambert drops a lock of hair and swears under his breath, nor when he manages to pick it up again without dropping the other two and swears <em>triumphantly</em>. At last he says, \u201cI think that\u2019s got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena takes the braid out of his hands and looks it over. \u201cVery good,\u201d she says, and smiles up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as even as yours is,\u201d he says, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but for a first attempt it\u2019s marvelous,\u201d she assures him. \u201c<em>My</em> first try at braiding hair ended up in <em>knots</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert preens. \u201cWell then,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll get it fucking <em>perfect</em> next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena grins. \u201cAnd then I can teach you a Toussainti braid,\u201d she teases. \u201cThat one\u2019s got <em>four</em> strands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert grimaces. \u201cCruel,\u201d he says mournfully. \u201cLet me have a <em>little</em> triumph?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will wear any braids you give me proudly,\u201d Milena says, and Lambert\u2019s eyes light up with such eager joy that her breath catches in her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them fucking <em>perfect</em>,\u201d he promises. \u201cAnything you teach me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Milena says, and rises. \u201cTraining?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining,\u201d Lambert says, and blushes, and takes something from his belt. \u201cI. I got sheaths made for your daggers.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sheaths are plain leather, but well-made and with loops to fasten onto her belt. Milena takes the sheathed daggers carefully, turning them over in her hands. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and draws one of them, holding it the way he taught her yesterday.</p>\n<p>Lambert eyes her fingers and nods. \u201cJust like that,\u201d he says, and stands. \u201cSame footwork drill as yesterday, but hold the knife, like so - keep your elbow loose - yes, like that. Alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s harder to keep up with his movements while <em>also</em> holding a very sharp blade in one hand, but not <em>much</em> harder, and it\u2019s still like dancing. Milena finds she\u2019s grinning, cheeks hurting with it, the pleasure of easy movement and Lambert\u2019s company and the tidy braids in her hair all like a warm coal in her chest, an ember warming her from the inside out. Lambert\u2019s grinning, too, broad and pleased and not even a <em>little</em> bit prickly.</p>\n<p>Staying here was <em>definitely</em> the right choice. Often embarrassing, frequently distressing, certainly <em>nothing</em> like the Redanian court or her own father\u2019s household - but the right choice, and maybe she\u2019s not quite accustomed to Kaer Morhen <em>yet</em>, but she <em>will</em> be, and not too far in the future, either. She\u2019ll be <em>home</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been five days since Lambert started teaching Milena to use a dagger, and she\u2019s still showing up every afternoon and smiling at him and letting him braid her hair and learning - slowly, but <em>learning</em> - how to hold a dagger and move with it. She hasn\u2019t decided he\u2019s too much of an asshole to spend time with. She <em>wears the braids</em> to supper, holding her head proudly even when Lambert can see the work is lopsided or a little messy, and he <em>still</em> hasn\u2019t gotten used to the sensation of her sleek, soft hair against his own callused hands. She\u2019s danced with him twice more, both of the nights Buttercup has chosen to play dancing music - with him and with no one else but the <em>cub</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not quite sure what he did to deserve this. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s <em>still</em> a prickly asshole, and he <em>certainly</em> has far too foul a mouth, and Milena just -</p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t seem to mind?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s baffling, but Lambert isn\u2019t stupid enough to ruin it on <em>purpose</em>.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s really quite pissed when fucking Clovis accidentally breaks his fucking <em>arm</em>. It\u2019ll heal in two or three days - Witcher healing, it\u2019s a hell of a thing - but he won\u2019t be holding a dagger until then.</p>\n<p>He shows up at the training salle with his arm in a sling - Triss is picky about that sort of thing, and yells at anyone who doesn\u2019t let her patch them up after any injury that won\u2019t have healed by supper - and Milena\u2019s eyes go <em>huge</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>happened</em>?\u201d she gasps, and moves towards him with her hands fluttering like she wants to touch him but doesn\u2019t want to make it worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking Clovis,\u201d Lambert says grumpily. \u201cTossed me through a fucking wall. <em>Again</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Again?\u201d Milena asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, the last time was a decade ago,\u201d Lambert says, because to be perfectly fair it <em>was</em>, but it\u2019s not the sort of thing someone <em>forgets</em>. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a couple of days. It\u2019s just fucking <em>annoying</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Right, Witcher healing,\u201d Milena says slowly. \u201cA broken arm isn\u2019t much more than a hassle to you, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cNot a clean break like this, anyhow.\u201d He shrugs with his good shoulder. \u201cDo you want to do footwork?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t...jar your arm?\u201d Milena asks. \u201cWe could just sit and talk, you know. Or walk, or -\u201d She trails off, looking rather lost.</p>\n<p>Honestly, sitting and talking sounds kind of nice. Lambert <em>could</em> do an afternoon of footwork drills, but one of the unfortunate things about Witcher metabolisms is that painkillers just plain don\u2019t work as well, so his arm <em>does</em> ache. \u201cI. We could sit,\u201d he says hesitantly, unsure that Milena will really <em>want</em> to spend a couple of hours talking to a grumpy asshole like him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Milena says, and then hesitates. \u201c...You can tell me this is foolish,\u201d she says, \u201cbut in Redania, sometimes, if two people are...are courting, and they\u2019re spending time just <em>talking</em>, sometimes one will - will sit at the other\u2019s feet with their head in the other\u2019s lap. Would you. Like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sit at her feet with his head in her lap.</p>\n<p>Would he <em>like</em> that?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, wondering if this is a trick question, and flops down in front of the nearest bench. Milena sits down behind him and smooths her skirts out, and Lambert leans back, and Milena - oh fucking hell - starts to run her fingers very gently through his short-cropped hair.</p>\n<p>It feels <em>really fucking good</em>.</p>\n<p>Lambert closes his eyes and just fucking <em>basks</em>. No wonder Geralt always looks so damn stupid when Buttercup plays with his hair. This is fucking <em>nice</em>. Milena has beautifully-tended fingernails and they scratch against his scalp just so, and Lambert feels like a fucking cat being scratched behind the ears. He\u2019s not sure if he <em>can</em> purr, but he sort of wants to.</p>\n<p>And Milena smells <em>happy</em>. Like this is making her just as contented as it is Lambert, just sitting here and petting his hair and being quiet together.</p>\n<p>She did say talking, though. And - the other night, she said something about poetry. <em>Lambert</em> doesn\u2019t know any poems, unless he counts the really filthy songs he\u2019s got memorized, which he is <em>not</em> going to quote to Milena; he\u2019s fairly sure there aren\u2019t any books of poetry in Kaer Morhen\u2019s library, either. But.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoetry,\u201d he says, and Milena hums. \u201cI don\u2019t know any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know a little,\u201d Milena says. \u201cI\u2019m not like Jaskier, I don\u2019t <em>think</em> in poems, but every noblewoman in Redania is expected to at least have an opinion about poetry. It\u2019s one of the noble arts.\u201d There\u2019s humor in her voice. \u201cAmong all the other very useful things we\u2019re taught.\u201d She pauses, fingers still scritching gently through his hair, and then says, \u201cThere\u2019s one I read a while back, and thought it was funny. And then I met you, and now it isn\u2019t funny anymore, it\u2019s...sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That\u2019s</em> frankly worrying. \u201cGo on,\u201d Lambert says warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me see, how did it go,\u201d Milena says, and hums a little. \u201cRight. <em>They came to tell your faults to me / They named them over, one by one / I laughed aloud when they were done / I knew them all so well before - / Oh, they were blind, too blind to see / Your faults had made me love you more.</em>\u201d*</p>\n<p>Lambert blinks up at her, too astonished to say anything at all. She\u2019s smiling down at him, sweet and soft, and her hands are so gentle, and her legs are warm against his back even through her skirts and his shirt, and she smells so <em>good</em>, roses and happiness together. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says after a long moment. Milena giggles.</p>\n<p><em>Your faults had made me love you more</em>. That\u2019s not \u2018you\u2019re an asshole but I guess I like you anyhow.\u2019 That - somehow, incomprehensibly, <em>impossibly</em> - is \u2018you\u2019re an asshole and <em>I like it</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cI...really like that poem,\u201d he says at last. <em>Really like</em> isn\u2019t quite accurate - it hurts, somehow, but it hurts <em>good</em>, not like a broken arm at all - but it\u2019s the most accurate phrase he\u2019s <em>got</em>, so it\u2019ll have to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good,\u201d Milena says. \u201cWhat <em>do</em> Witchers learn, if you don\u2019t have to memorize poetry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert closes his eyes again. It would be harder to talk about this, but her hands are <em>so</em> nice, and he\u2019s remarkably comfortable, and even his arm is hurting less. \u201cWe memorize a lot of potions recipes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd monsters. What they look like, how they fight, how to kill them.\u201d He pauses, trying to find something in Witcher training that <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> horrify a gently-bred woman. \u201cLanguages.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many do you speak?\u201d Milena asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cCommon Nordling, Nilfgaardian, Skelliger dialect, Elder,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cAnd I can swear in Dwarvish and Gnomish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena giggles. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d She sounds <em>fond</em>, like she is amused and delighted by his penchant for learning as many curse words as he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else do noble ladies learn?\u201d Lambert asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmbroidery,\u201d Milena says. \u201cHousehold management. Basic stillroom skills. Courtesy. I can play a lap harp, but not very well, and paint a little, and judge the price and workmanship of a piece of cloth or jewelry pretty accurately. Dancing, obviously. Formal correspondence - there are books with explanatory tables, you know, telling you exactly how to write a letter for almost any occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds <em>really fucking boring</em>,\u201d Lambert admits. \u201cThe letters, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it is,\u201d Milena assures him. \u201cBut once you get used to the formulae, it\u2019s easier to see what people are <em>really</em> saying, sort of between all the courtesy. There\u2019s a whole second language, almost - everything\u2019s got connotations and hidden meanings, and then there\u2019s <em>flower</em> language, too, so if someone sends a letter with a <em>bouquet</em> it takes half an hour to figure out what they actually meant rather than what they <em>said</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>,\u201d Lambert says.</p>\n<p>Milena laughs. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, that\u2019s part of why I like it here so much,\u201d she says, in the tone of one confiding a secret. \u201cNobody here hides their lies behind pretty words and flowers. Everybody says exactly what they <em>mean</em>, or near enough. It\u2019s very refreshing.\u201d One of her fingers traces the curve of his ear, and Lambert shivers in astonished pleasure. \u201c<em>You</em> don\u2019t hide anything,\u201d she says, even more softly. \u201cIt\u2019s so <em>nice</em>, not having to wonder if you\u2019re spending time with me for some secret reason or other - politics, or wealth, or wanting a titled wife, or what have you. You just - want to spend time with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert opens his eyes, and the smile on her face, even upside-down, is so utterly <em>besotted</em> that he has to wonder if this whole afternoon is some sort of dream - if Triss dosed him with something that makes Witchers hallucinate. Nobody <em>actually</em> looks at him like that. It can\u2019t possibly be real. But she <em>smells</em> real, and her hands <em>feel</em> real, and even in a hallucination he\u2019s pretty sure he couldn\u2019t conjure up the sweet happiness in those dark eyes. \u201cI. I like spending time with you,\u201d he says, silently cursing his own awkwardness.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I with you,\u201d Milena says, nothing but truth in her scent and her heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Lambert is genuinely not sure what he did right to end up here, but whatever it was, he <em>desperately</em> wants to do it again.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cButtercup,\u201d Lambert says, later that same afternoon, and Buttercup makes an agreeable sort of noise from where he\u2019s sprawled on Geralt\u2019s lap across the hot spring from Lambert. \u201cDo you have - do you have books of poetry?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>That</em> gets Buttercup to open his eyes and give Lambert a thoughtful look. \u201cI have a few,\u201d he says. \u201cI could probably get more, if I asked Yen nicely. Why do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt is watching the whole exchange with a tiny, smug smile. Bastard. At least Eskel\u2019s <em>pretending</em> not to listen.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Lambert grumbles. He can\u2019t quite figure out how to say <em>out loud</em> that he wants to find a poem that makes <em>Milena</em> feel as - as warm and happy as the one she recited did for <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope nope nope, no \u2018never mind\u2019ing,\u201d Buttercup says. \u201cYou want poetry, I will <em>get</em> you poetry. Epics? Limericks? Love poems? You name it, I will find it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really fucking annoying how Lambert can\u2019t actually get <em>mad</em> at Buttercup for the teasing, because then he turns around and says something like <em>that</em>. \u201cLove poems,\u201d Lambert mutters, and Buttercup gives Eskel a <em>look</em> that keeps the other Witcher from saying anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d Buttercup says. \u201cGive me three days, and I\u2019ll have you a selection.\u201d And then, thank the fucking <em>gods</em>, he starts rambling about something else - some lady he knew in Oxenfurt, who had a bookshop with a hidden door that led to an entire room full of bawdy novels. \u201cYou should\u2019ve <em>seen</em> it,\u201d he says cheerfully, lounging back against Geralt and gesturing with both hands. Geralt\u2019s got his arms around Buttercup\u2019s waist so the bard doesn\u2019t tip over and slide underwater, and is giving his consort a very silly little smile. \u201cJust - wall to wall <em>smut</em>, it was amazing. Of course she charged through the <em>nose</em>, but!\u201d Buttercup taps his own nose, looking as sly as he can, which isn\u2019t very. Eskel is already snickering. \u201cYou can\u2019t get those <em>printed</em>, they\u2019ve got to be hand-copied, because no printer in Redania would risk their machines being confiscated for aiding and abetting such debauchery. So if you were a <em>clever</em> fellow, and had truly elegant handwriting - <em>which</em> I do, of course - you could make a deal with the proprietress!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou copied them for her,\u201d Eskel says, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, made half my pocket money every year I was at university by doing so!\u201d Buttercup says proudly. \u201c<em>And</em> I learned a lot. None of it suitable to be <em>graded</em> on, of course, but learning is never wasted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, very amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, yourself,\u201d Buttercup retorts, grinning. \u201cI don\u2019t see <em>you</em> complaining about my vast and varied knowledge.\u201d He turns his head to look at Geralt and wiggles his eyebrows outrageously. Eskel falls over onto Lambert\u2019s shoulder - the good one, thank fuck - and shakes with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot complaining,\u201d Geralt says, very complacently. \u201cMight take notes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Buttercup goes off into peals of laughter. \u201cYou,\u201d he gasps, \u201cyou are as much of a menace as Ciri is! <em>That\u2019s</em> where she gets it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d says Geralt, smugly.</p>\n<p>Lambert...wants Milena here, actually. She\u2019s much, much too uncomfortable with the communal baths to <em>actually</em> join them in their usual pre-supper ritual, but he wants her here next to him, laughing at Buttercup and snuggling up to Lambert\u2019s shoulder and maybe running her fingers through his hair again.</p>\n<p>Or sitting on his lap, like Buttercup sits on Geralt\u2019s, held close and safe, happy and protected.</p>\n<p>On second thought, he should <em>not</em> be thinking about Milena sitting on his lap. The water muffles smells, but he does not want Eskel to start asking questions about why he\u2019s started smelling <em>horny</em> in the middle of bathing.</p>\n<p>Maybe he <em>won\u2019t</em> ask Milena if she thinks she\u2019ll ever be used to Kaer Morhen\u2019s communal bathing and would like to join him. That...that might not end well.</p>\n<p>How the fuck <em>Geralt</em> manages to not smell like lust all the time, Lambert hasn\u2019t the faintest idea. <em>Buttercup</em> certainly does. But then, Buttercup smells like lust pretty much every moment he\u2019s within sight of Geralt, so every Witcher in the keep has pretty much gotten used to it. Geralt, the romantic fucker, smells like <em>love</em> instead, every time he so much as <em>thinks</em> about the bard. It\u2019s really sweet, which Lambert will <em>never</em> admit aloud.</p>\n<p>Back when Geralt was first pulling all the Witchers together into the unstoppable army that they\u2019ve become, a fair number of Witchers from other Schools thought he was weak because he <em>didn\u2019t </em>constantly smell like anger. Geralt disabused them of that pretty fast - Lambert still cherishes the memories of watching the White Wolf beat the fucking crap out of half a dozen other Witchers, two and three at a time, because it was fucking <em>beautiful</em> to watch - but it\u2019s still fairly unusual, the way Geralt smells like love whenever he thinks of Buttercup or the cub, of happiness around Eskel or Yen or even Lambert himself, of general calm contentment instead of barely-leashed anger. Witchers are <em>less</em> hated, now, than they ever have been before, but it hasn\u2019t even been two decades yet. It\u2019s taking most of them a while to really adjust to being -</p>\n<p>Well, to being the White Wolf\u2019s army, acclaimed as protectors, instead of being derided as only barely more tolerable than the monsters they slay.</p>\n<p>Fuck, if Lambert spends much more time around Milena, <em>he</em> might start being one of the Witchers who mostly smells like happiness instead of rage.</p>\n<p>That...that\u2019ll be a change.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s maybe looking forward to that.</p>\n<p>Milena has been part of the White Wolf\u2019s court for about a week, and is starting to think she\u2019s maybe starting to figure out how everything works, the day she\u2019s following Lady Yennefer and Triss out of the baths and one of the few female warriors in the keep calls, \u201cGirl. New girl. C\u2019mere a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena goes over to her warily. The woman - Zofia, Milena thinks her name is; she wears a Viper medallion and wields a wickedly curved blade on the practice grounds - beckons her to follow, and walks around a sort of outcropping in the rock, which leads to a little alcove entirely hidden from the main cavern\u2019s view, with a single deep hot spring in it, and a number of ledges on the walls heaped with linen strips and little jars.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too many women in the keep as get our monthlies, but this is where we come when we <em>do</em>,\u201d Zofia says bluntly. \u201cAll the springs are spelled to stay clean, but <em>I\u2019d</em> rather not be bleeding in the water around a bunch of Witchers, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Last month, when she was her sister\u2019s escort, Milena made do with sponge baths in their rooms, which was rather miserable. This looks <em>much</em> more pleasant. \u201c<em>Thank</em> you,\u201d she says, and then grins as the thought hits her. \u201cNobody showed this to Princess Agata.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zofia snorts. \u201cThat prissy bitch? Fuck her. \u2018Sides, I dunno that the sorceresses know about it, nor the songbird either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t?\u201d Milena asks, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorceresses don\u2019t bleed,\u201d Zofia says. \u201cI think the magic burns out their wombs, or something like that. I\u2019ve never <em>asked</em>, mind you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena contemplates asking Lady Yennefer - or even Triss - such a thing, and decides she likes her head <em>attached</em>, thank you very much. \u201cQuite,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, thank you <em>so</em> much for letting me know; I really cannot tell you how much I appreciate it.\u201d She slants a look at the older woman - broad-shouldered, scarred, handsome rather than beautiful and <em>so</em> confident in her stance - and adds tentatively, \u201cWould you - would you mind terribly if I asked you for advice, sometime?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn Witchers?\u201d Zofia asks. Milena nods. Zofia grins. \u201cYeah, sure. Hells, I\u2019ll give it to you right now.\u201d She leans back against the wall and raises a hand, ticking the points off on her fingers as Milena feels her cheeks grow hotter and hotter.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst thing, a Witcher\u2019s the safest fuck you\u2019re going to ever have, girl. Can\u2019t give you a pox <em>or</em> get you with child. Bitey, though, all of \u2018em.\u201d Milena <em>has</em> noticed the many lovebites which decorate Jaskier\u2019s throat and shoulders, and which he shows off proudly. \u201cAnd they\u2019re <em>always</em> fucking up for it, so you gotta be able to tell \u2018em to fuck off when you\u2019re tired.\u201d Milena nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond thing - you a virgin, girl?\u201d Milena nods again, cheeks flaming. \u201cHuh. Well, gotta start sometime,\u201d Zofia says, shrugging, which is <em>not</em> how anyone at court would <em>ever</em> think of it. \u201cBut wait till <em>you\u2019re</em> ready. That asshole\u2019s got two good hands; he can get his own damn self off. Don\u2019t you let him make you feel <em>obliged</em>, girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t - he <em>hasn\u2019t</em>,\u201d Milena says, feeling rather as though she ought to defend Lambert\u2019s honor, which is a very strange sensation. \u201cHe\u2019s been a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat prickly asshole, a gentleman?\u201d Zofia says, eyebrows going up. \u201cHuh. Must be love. Be damned. Well then. My point stands. He can wait till <em>you\u2019re</em> good and ready. Got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods. This is - this is not like the talk she <em>thought</em> she would get someday, perhaps the day before her wedding, probably from her mother or an aunt. It\u2019s a lot blunter, and - she is utterly certain - a <em>lot</em> more useful.</p>\n<p>\u201cThird thing. When you <em>do</em> let him under your skirts, girl, you tell him to put that filthy mouth of his to use before he ever gets his prick in you. You <em>do</em> know how fucking works, right? I don\u2019t have to draw a diagram?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena swallows embarrassment and nods. \u201cThe...man\u2019s prick goes in the...the woman\u2019s cunny,\u201d she says faintly. <em>Mouth</em>, though - Lambert\u2019s mouth? If she\u2019s understanding Zofia correctly, Lambert\u2019s mouth <em>there</em>?</p>\n<p>Oh <em>gods</em>, she can\u2019t think about that, she\u2019ll die of sheer embarrassment right here.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good,\u201d Zofia says. \u201cI\u2019m shit at drawing diagrams. Anyhow. Make sure <em>you</em> get your pleasure, too. Witchers are mostly pretty good about that, but I know nobles are fucking stupid about - how\u2019s it go - \u2018lie back and think of heirs\u2019? And he won\u2019t be getting heirs on you, girl, so you might as well get something <em>else</em> out of it, hey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Milena says. She may actually spontaneously combust from blushing, but she understands.</p>\n<p>\u201cLast thing,\u201d Zofia says, and frowns. \u201cI dunno if the songbird knows about this, actually. How old do you think I am, girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena looks at her carefully. \u201c...Thirty?\u201d she ventures at last. She can\u2019t be <em>much</em> older than that; her skin is still smooth between the scars, her face mostly unwrinkled, her breasts still firm.</p>\n<p>\u201cForty-six last month,\u201d Zofia says. \u201cI\u2019ve been fucking my Auckes for over a decade now, and I feel younger than when I <em>met</em> him.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBest we can tell - there\u2019s not a <em>lot</em> of us who\u2019ve taken Witcher lovers, you know - best we can tell, the <em>Witchers</em> get their lifespans from those mutagen things, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, well, we figure there\u2019s mutagens in their seed. One or two fucks won\u2019t have any effect, but <em>regular</em> fucking, for <em>years</em>, and it starts to build up. We\u2019ve pretty much stopped aging, those of us who\u2019ve been with our Witchers for a while, even gotten a little <em>younger</em> maybe, and we heal faster, too. Not <em>Witcher</em>-fast, but faster than we ought. And we stay healthy. I haven\u2019t gotten a sniffle in three years. So you start fucking your Witcher, girl, and you\u2019ll stay young and pretty a <em>really</em> damned long time.\u201d She snorts. \u201cSongbird\u2019s fucking the <em>White Wolf</em>, he might actually end up immortal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Milena says, knowing her eyes are wide with astonishment. \u201cDo the <em>Witchers</em> know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Zofia says, and snorts again. \u201cTruth of the matter is, we\u2019re waiting to see if they <em>notice</em>. Idiots can spot a nekker half a mile away and don\u2019t see what\u2019s under their noses sometimes. And they\u2019re really fucking bad at <em>time</em>. Comes of being halfway to immortal, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena grins. \u201cWell then, I won\u2019t tell - except maybe Jaskier,\u201d she says. \u201cIs there a betting pool on when they\u2019ll figure it out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zofia guffaws. \u201c<em>There</em> we go, girl, there\u2019s your bite,\u201d she says approvingly. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a pool; you want in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena considers what she knows of Witchers, and says, \u201cTwo crowns on another decade at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d Zofia says, and holds out a hand. Milena shakes it. Zofia claps her cheerfully on the shoulder and leads her out towards the dressing room, looking very pleased with herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Milena says, once they\u2019re both clothed and ready to head up for breakfast. \u201cThank you <em>very</em> much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Zofia says, grinning at her. \u201cAnyone who can turn that asshole into a gentleman is fine in <em>my</em> books. And hey - come find me sometime, and I\u2019ll teach you a couple dirty tricks Lambert won\u2019t. Never know when that sort\u2019ve thing will come in handy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Milena says. \u201cAnd - if you want anything embroidered, or anything like that, I\u2019d be very happy to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Zofia says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t mind having a nice bit of embroidery here and there, couple pretty things for feasts and such. I\u2019ll bring a few things by.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shall look forward to it,\u201d Milena says, quite honestly. She <em>likes</em> embroidery, and if it will help repay the almost certainly <em>priceless</em> advice she\u2019s gotten today, she\u2019s even happier to do it.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a few days later, and Milena is <em>very</em> grateful to have learned of the private hot spring, if rather sad to miss out on her usual morning gossip sessions with Jaskier and Triss and Lady Yennefer, when she gets to the training salle for her lesson and Lambert shoots to his feet, staring at her in horror, and says, \u201cAre you <em>hurt</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Milena says, rather startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell like blood,\u201d Lambert says, hurrying over to her and holding out his hands like he wants to pat her down and find the injury, palms hovering just above her shoulders. \u201cWhere - who hurt you - I\u2019ll fucking <em>kill</em> them -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLambert!\u201d Milena says sharply, and he stops, blinking at her. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>hurt</em>, I\u2019m - I\u2019m fertile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lambert says, blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my monthlies,\u201d Milena says, blushing hotly. Gods, she\u2019s never had to <em>tell a man</em> this before, but - well, if he can smell the blood, then keeping it private isn\u2019t going to work.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour what now?\u201d Lambert says.</p>\n<p>Milena blinks at him. \u201cYou\u2019re eighty-something years old,\u201d she says slowly, \u201cand you don\u2019t know what a woman\u2019s monthlies are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of women in Kaer Morhen,\u201d Lambert says, scowling. \u201cWhat are you <em>talking</em> about, and why are you fucking <em>bleeding</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena rubs her forehead. This was not how she planned to spend her afternoon, but - well - Witchers. Living in Kaer Morhen <em>definitely</em> teaches one to roll with the punches. \u201cCome and sit down,\u201d she says, and takes his hand and pulls him over to the bench. He follows, looking baffled and unhappy. \u201cAlright. So. Women who can...who can have children, once they\u2019re old enough, every month or so they bleed for a few days. From.\u201d She gestures vaguely at her lap. \u201cWell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert stares at her in something like horror. \u201cEvery <em>month</em>? A few <em>days</em>? How do you not bleed <em>out</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <em>that</em> much blood, really,\u201d Milena says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re...built for it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuilt for -\u201d Lambert says, and sort of chokes on the words, staring off into space like he\u2019s been whacked upside the head with a club. \u201cOh fucking <em>gods</em>,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201c<em>Ciri</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo young yet,\u201d Milena says promptly. \u201cBut I suspect it\u2019s part of why Jaskier wanted me to be her lady-in-waiting, yes; she should have <em>someone</em> around who knows about this sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d says Lambert, quite fervently, and looks at her with wild eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019re - you\u2019re <em>not</em> hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it aches a bit,\u201d Milena says, putting a hand to her stomach. \u201cBut I don\u2019t get cramps as bad as some women do. I <em>can</em> still train today. I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lambert says, and rubs the back of his head. \u201cI. Um. I gotta tell Eskel and Geralt, at least. If they smell blood on you, they\u2019ll be worried too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they worry whenever any of the - oh,\u201d Milena says, answering her own question before she finishes asking it. \u201cBecause they\u2019re warriors, so getting hurt is fairly normal. And the servants stay out of your way, mostly. But I\u2019m <em>not</em> a warrior.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert nods. \u201cYou\u2019re not a warrior,\u201d he agrees. \u201cAnd I\u2019m known to be a fucking asshole, so. Most obvious conclusion is <em>I</em> hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>no</em>,\u201d Milena says, horrified. \u201cYou <em>wouldn\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert blinks at her. \u201cYou mean that,\u201d he says at last, and breathes in, slow and thoughtful. \u201cHuh. Yeah. You mean that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI might still be wary of the <em>White Wolf</em>,\u201d Milena says, a little tartly, \u201cbut I stopped being scared of <em>you</em> sometime around the day you carried me down a mountainside so gently I barely even noticed we were moving.\u201d That\u2019s a <em>good</em> memory, in point of fact: his arms were warm and strong and gentle, and the rumble of his voice was oddly comforting, and by the time they got back to the keep, she\u2019d gone from being disturbed by his slitted eyes to thinking the amber shade really quite lovely.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Lambert, looking like he\u2019s been whacked upside the head with a club again. \u201cThat\u2019s. Good?\u201d He swallows hard and looks down and only then seems to notice that she\u2019s still holding his hand. \u201cYou really want to train today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoving helps,\u201d Milena says. \u201cAnd distraction helps, too. And I <em>definitely</em> want to spend time with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert <em>blushes</em>. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says. \u201cThen - um - footwork? I don\u2019t think I can hold a fucking knife on you when you already smell like blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Milena says, and rises.</p>\n<p>Lambert leads her back and forth across the salle for a while, and the exertion <em>does</em> help; she feels much better by the time they finally stop, but also very much like she wants a bath. Lambert gives her a <em>very</em> odd look when she falls into step beside him as he heads down to the hot springs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that you\u2019re <em>not</em> welcome,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think you <em>liked</em> the\u2026\u201d he trails off and waves a hand mutely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a side chamber one of the other women showed me,\u201d Milena says. \u201cAnd I want a bath too much to be scared off by a bunch of naked Witchers.\u201d Big words - with a little luck, she can actually back them up. But she <em>does</em> want a bath quite desperately, and hopefully all the Witchers will be <em>in</em> the water, so she won\u2019t see more than shoulders and heads. She\u2019s gotten quite good at keeping her gaze above the collarbones, these last couple of weeks of bathing with Jaskier and Triss and Lady Yennefer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmph,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cAnybody bothers you, let me know, and I\u2019ll deal with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena smiles. \u201cThank you. Really, nobody\u2019s given me any trouble at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re not an idiot out to trap the White Wolf,\u201d Lambert grumbles. \u201cOr. Um. Any sort of idiot. <em>Fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena chuckles and pats his shoulder gently. \u201cI knew what you meant.\u201d She hesitates, sighs, and says, \u201cYou could tell Eskel and the White Wolf while you\u2019re bathing. About. Um.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you smell like blood,\u201d Lambert says, grimacing a little. \u201cI <em>really</em> don\u2019t like smelling blood on you. It\u2019s just - I keep thinking you\u2019re fucking <em>hurt</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to happen every month,\u201d Milena says. \u201cIs that - can you -\u201d Somehow, nothing in any courtship manual ever covered what to do if your prospective suitor can <em>smell your monthlies</em> and hates the smell of blood on you.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cI don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which is sort of sweet, really. Milena thinks for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about,\u201d she says slowly, \u201cI promise to tell you at once if I ever <em>am</em> truly hurt. Would that help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat - that would help a lot, actually,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods, and Lambert pushes the door to the hot springs open for her. Milena skirts along the side of the room until she reaches the little alcove, and slips into it -</p>\n<p>And turns back, feeling a little wicked, to peer around the outcropping at Lambert as he strips down.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s seen him <em>shirtless</em> before, because Witchers do tend to wander around shirtless even in the cold halls of Kaer Morhen. She\u2019s never really looked her fill, though, because it\u2019s always been in the main hall and she\u2019s felt <em>far</em> too self-conscious to stare. Now, though. Now he\u2019s facing away from her, and no one else is around to see her being so utterly unmannerly as to look.</p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s back is broad and scarred, tanned from the summer\u2019s training. A man\u2019s bare back is only a <em>little</em> scandalous to look at so hungrily - men might go shirtless for hard labor, or hot weather, or to swim. Wanting to <em>touch</em> is a lot more scandalous, but there\u2019s no one here to know, and Milena - Milena really <em>does</em> want to touch. She knows he\u2019s absurdly strong - all Witchers are - but she wants to know if his skin is soft, if the scars would be rough against her fingers, if he would be furnace-warm beneath her hands.</p>\n<p>And then he kicks off his breeches, and Milena bites her lower lip <em>hard</em>. She\u2019s...well, she\u2019s <em>seen</em> a naked Witcher before, that time the White Wolf walked right past all of them without a stitch of fabric on, but she didn\u2019t <em>look</em>; and she\u2019s bathed with a naked man every morning for a week and more, but she\u2019s never looked at <em>Jaskier</em>, either. Now, looking at Lambert\u2026</p>\n<p>The first thing her eyes light on is, in fact, another scar, one that suggests something with large claws dragged one right down Lambert\u2019s back and over his ass. But apart from that, it\u2019s - well, Milena doesn\u2019t exactly have a lot of other examples to compare it to, but it\u2019s quite a nice ass. Nice legs, too, strong and scarred and well-formed. She really shouldn\u2019t be staring like this.</p>\n<p>She likes looking at him, though.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d kind of like to see his <em>other</em> side.</p>\n<p>Lambert steps into the water, splashing the other Witchers around him and eliciting squawks and a half-hearted punch, and Milena shakes herself and retreats into the little alcove, to the quiet solitary pool and a soothingly hot bath.</p>\n<p>Buttercup comes through with surprising tact: he gives Lambert a little stack of books after dinner several days after their conversation, without saying anything to draw attention to it. Lambert squirrels them away in his rooms and reads through them in spare hours here and there, without much enjoyment. Poetry is <em>not</em> something he understands. Most of it is all impenetrable metaphors and stupid flowery language and idiots swearing dumb oaths that don\u2019t even make sense.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s one he kind of likes, from a slim book that <em>also</em> has the poem Milena quoted, the one that hurt and felt good at the same time. He memorizes it carefully, tucking it away like it\u2019s an incantation or a list of potions ingredients. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a good time to recite it, really; while they\u2019re training they talk about <em>training</em>, or about Kaer Morhen and the Witchers and the cub, and in the evenings they dance or end up talking with Triss or Buttercup or the cub, and Lambert\u2019s sure as hell not going to recite poetry in front of anyone <em>else</em>.</p>\n<p>Milena stops smelling like blood after four days, which is such a relief Lambert can\u2019t even express it. Blood is just - blood is just a bad smell on Milena. She should <em>never</em> smell hurt.</p>\n<p>(Also that may have been the least comfortable conversation he has <em>ever</em> had with Eskel and Geralt, and there is some <em>serious competition</em> for that spot. But \u2018Milena smells like blood because <em>apparently this is a thing human women do</em> and also, just so\u2019s you know, at some point <em>Ciri will too</em>,\u2019 was just...really, really unpleasant. The fact that Geralt and Eskel both reacted with about as much dismay and horror as Lambert had was only a very <em>small</em> counterweight to the general fucking disaster of the whole mess.)</p>\n<p>Milena doesn\u2019t learn as fast as a Witcher trainee, but then, she\u2019s a grown woman and doesn\u2019t have any prior weapons training. She <em>definitely</em> keeps at it with a commendable amount of enthusiasm...at least up until the point that she has to try to stab him.</p>\n<p>The first day Lambert says, \u201cAlright, good - now hit me,\u201d Milena raises the knife, flinches hard, and drops it. Lambert blinks at her in surprise. He can\u2019t smell blood - she didn\u2019t <em>cut</em> herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Milena says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cYou - there\u2019s really no way you can hit me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena swallows. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert considers that. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says at last, picking up the dropped dagger. \u201cPut the sheath on it, and hit me with the <em>covered</em> blade. And I\u2019ll stop you. Go as hard and fast as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena takes the sheath off her belt and slides it onto the blade, and gives him a long thoughtful look, and then moves rather faster than he\u2019d expected. He\u2019s genuinely impressed.</p>\n<p>He still catches her wrist, as gently as he can - gently enough not to bruise even very delicate skin - and slides his other arm around her waist, pinning her to his chest so she can\u2019t easily pull away.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d he murmurs in her ear. Milena\u2019s heart kicks up, suddenly almost twice as fast, and her scent spikes with surprise but not <em>fear</em>, no fear at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re so <em>fast</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smells so <em>good</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways faster than you,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise what\u2019s the point in being a fucking Witcher? You <em>can\u2019t</em> stab me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you training,\u201d Milena says thoughtfully, \u201cbut somehow it\u2019s not quite as obvious how fast you are when I\u2019m up on the walltop.\u201d She staring up at him with enormous dark eyes, and she\u2019s a lithe warm armful tucked against him, and she isn\u2019t struggling - doesn\u2019t seem to want to escape his grasp at all, in fact.</p>\n<p>The temptation to kiss her is very, very strong.</p>\n<p>Milena licks her lips, a tiny little flick of her tongue, which does not help at <em>all</em>.</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>Lambert wants to do this <em>right</em>. He isn\u2019t quite sure what that <em>means</em>, yet, but it almost certainly doesn\u2019t mean kissing her while he\u2019s got her pinned and helpless in his arms. Even if she doesn\u2019t mind being there. Very carefully, he lets go, making sure she doesn\u2019t trip as she steps back out of his embrace.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Milena says, and takes the sheath off the dagger. \u201cI <em>can\u2019t</em> stab you. Shall I try anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s pretty sure his grin is somewhere on the wrong side of feral, but Milena doesn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cYeah, you should. Come on, then.\u201d He beckons her with an empty hand, and Milena <em>laughs</em> - fuck, but it\u2019s a beautiful sound - and moves just the way he\u2019s taught her, right and left and back and <em>forward</em>, a picture-perfect lunge.</p>\n<p>He catches her wrist and twists away from the strike, and she recovers expertly, light and easy on her feet, grinning fit to match any wolf alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like that,\u201d Lambert says, throat oddly dry. \u201cJust like that, again.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s been in Kaer Morhen as the cub\u2019s lady-in-waiting for a month and a half, and Lambert still hasn\u2019t kissed her. Well. He\u2019s kissed her hand, twice, and both times felt like he might fucking <em>die</em> at the taste of her lingering on his lips. He\u2019s held her close as they dance, and closer when she fails to stab him - she\u2019s getting better, but he knows she\u2019ll never manage it, and so does she, and they\u2019re both content with that. He\u2019s had his hands in her hair almost every day, has mastered simple braids and Toussainti braids and fishtail braids and reverse braids and even a complicated updo that involves three ribbons and a pin long enough to almost be a dagger in its own right.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s smelled blood on her, copper-hot and dreadful, twice now, four days each time, and hated every second of it; but it was easier the second time, to accept that she wasn\u2019t <em>hurt</em>, just...human.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s memorized the scent of her, rosewater soap and honest sweat, bright happiness and rich lust and something sweet he doesn\u2019t quite dare name; the scent of her hair stays on his hands, lingering through the dark hours and winding its way into his dreams.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s spent hours upon hours talking to her, teaching her to swear in four languages and listening to her recite poetry (though he hasn\u2019t dared do the same, not yet), discussing Witcher training and noble upbringing, learning which flowers to give people if he wants to be as rude as possible, laughing about the cub\u2019s antics and Buttercup\u2019s ridiculously sweet adoration of the Wolf.</p>\n<p>But he hasn\u2019t kissed her.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s waiting for.</p>\n<p>He finds out quite by accident.</p>\n<p>Milena shows up for training looking - a little lost, maybe a little sad. <em>Smelling</em> a little sad. Lambert\u2019s bristling immediately. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he demands, because if someone has <em>said</em> something to her, he\u2019s going to go punch them right in their fucking <em>mouth</em>, doesn\u2019t matter who it is -</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Milena says, and that\u2019s a lie.</p>\n<p>Lambert scowls at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not fucking nothing if you smell like that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d tell me if you were hurt.\u201d Sad isn\u2019t the same as hurt, but it\u2019s all one; Milena shouldn\u2019t ever smell anything but <em>happy</em>, and Lambert will punch as many people as he has to, to make that true.</p>\n<p>Milena gives him a sort of half smile, sad and amused at the same time. \u201cReally, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says, and Lambert scowls harder. She sighs. \u201cOh, fine. <em>Witchers</em>. Worse than bloodhounds. It\u2019s just - oh, hells, it\u2019s my birthday, and I was hoping my parents would - would have forgiven me at least enough to send a letter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer might open a portal to Roggeven if Lambert asks politely and tells her it\u2019s for Milena; she <em>likes</em> Milena. He could go punch the Duke de Roggeven right in his stupid mouth. But that\u2019s maybe a project for later. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was your birthday,\u201d he says. He should\u2019ve asked, but - well - Witchers don\u2019t <em>have</em> birthdays, really; most of them don\u2019t <em>know</em> what day they were born, and celebrating the day they were brought to Kaer Morhen would be really fucking depressing. \u201cI didn\u2019t get you anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena smiles up at him. \u201cI never mentioned it,\u201d she points out. \u201cHow could you have known? And you don\u2019t have to get me anything. Just spending time with you is a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>How the <em>fuck</em> is a man supposed to cope with a statement like that, Lambert would like to know?</p>\n<p>\u201cI. I\u2019d have <em>wanted</em> to get you something, if I\u2019d known,\u201d Lambert says, because it\u2019s true. He\u2019d kind of like to give Milena something, something that would please her, and see her smile. He\u2019s got no idea <em>what</em>, but - he could come up with something. Buttercup would help, if he asked, or the cub, even. \u201cWhat <em>would</em> you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena looks up at him, long lashes half veiling dark eyes, and Lambert honestly can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s thinking. She starts smelling <em>nervous</em>, though. Which makes Lambert nervous, because <em>fuck</em>, she\u2019s got to know he\u2019d give her anything she wanted, there\u2019s nothing - well, almost nothing - she could ask for that he <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> want to give her. She licks her lips, and Lambert is staring and <em>really</em> should look away, but oh <em>fuck</em> she\u2019s so - so close, and so pretty, and smells so good, and it isn\u2019t fucking fair that she can turn him into a fucking <em>mess</em> without ever saying a word.</p>\n<p>Not that he\u2019d change her even if he could. But still.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you do,\u201d Milena says, slowly and softly and carefully, every word individually weighed out like golden coins, \u201cif I said I wanted a kiss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Lambert asks. His voice <em>doesn\u2019t</em> break. It hasn\u2019t broken in fucking <em>decades</em>, it certainly doesn\u2019t <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p>Milena reaches up, slowly, to put her hand on his cheek, and meets his eyes. \u201cIf,\u201d she says, very quietly, \u201cif it would mean as much to you as it would to me - if you love me, Lambert, because I love <em>you</em>, very dearly - then yes, I would like a kiss. But only then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI. You. <em>Fuck,</em> Milena,\u201d says Lambert, and loses every word in his fucking idiot head, and then, thank whichever gods look out for fools and witchers, remembers the poem, the one that made <em>sense</em> when all the others were fucking bullshit. She smiles, and there\u2019s a giggle beginning somewhere deep in her throat, one he wants to hear, but not as much as he wants to get this <em>right</em>. He turns his head to kiss her thumb, and she draws in a short breath, surprised, pleased, <em>waiting</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>But what to me are north and south,</em>\u201d he says, and her eyes go wide. \u201c<em>And what the lure of many lands / since you have leaned to catch my hands / and lay a kiss upon my mouth.</em>\u201d* It\u2019s a proper Witcher\u2019s poem, he\u2019d thought when he first read it. Or - the first bit is a Witcher\u2019s poem. The second bit is - is this, right here, because the world is huge and terrible and full of monsters and the only piece of it he really fucking <em>needs</em> is the woman looking at him, wide-eyed and trembling, not quite yet in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, soft and wondering, and he kisses her.</p>\n<p>She tastes <em>so fucking good</em>.</p>\n<p>And - look, Lambert hasn\u2019t kissed a lot of people, whores charge extra for it and he\u2019s always had better things to do with his coin, but now he\u2019s thinking he was an <em>idiot</em>, or maybe it\u2019s just this good because he actually <em>wants</em> to kiss Milena, because she\u2019s warm and sweet in his arms (and when did he wrap his arms around her?) and her hands on his cheeks are so fucking soft, and she tastes of mint and cloves, and she <em>sighs</em> like she\u2019s been waiting for this forever, and melts against him, trusting him to hold her up. Lambert would be perfectly happy to stand here kissing her for the next <em>decade</em> if that\u2019s what she wanted. It\u2019s just - her trust, her slight weight and soft warmth, the smell of roses and <em>happiness</em> filling the air, her lips so gentle against his -</p>\n<p>This might <em>actually</em> be a perfect moment.</p>\n<p>She breaks the kiss after - a while, Lambert hasn\u2019t been trying to keep track of the <em>time</em>, alright, he\u2019s been busy trying to memorize the way her eyelashes look against her cheeks and the taste of her mouth - but she doesn\u2019t pull away, just slides her hands down from his cheeks to loop around the back of his neck and smiles up at him. He doesn\u2019t remember doing it, but he\u2019s got both arms wrapped around her waist and has pulled her close so she\u2019s pressed up against him, and he can feel her chest rise and fall against his as she breathes. There are spots of color high on her cheeks and her lips are very pink and she smells like distilled happiness, so strong and sweet Lambert thinks he could probably get drunk off just the <em>smell</em>.</p>\n<p>He has no idea what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the best kiss I have ever gotten,\u201d Milena says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt. Mine, too,\u201d Lambert admits. He doesn\u2019t want to think about other people kissing her. He doesn\u2019t want anyone else to ever kiss her again. If he keeps doing whatever the fuck he\u2019s apparently doing right, maybe she\u2019ll never <em>want</em> to kiss anyone else.</p>\n<p>Milena licks her lips. Lambert swallows hard. \u201cWould you,\u201d Milena says, almost a whisper, \u201cwould you mind very much if I said I wanted another?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould I <em>mind</em>?\u201d Lambert says, and kisses her again. Oh <em>fuck</em>, it\u2019s better the second time, because now he knows she likes it if he moves his tongue just so, bends his head a little more and gathers her even closer. She makes a tiny sound against his lips, so soft only a Witcher could have heard it, and he wants to hear it <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>When the second kiss ends, Milena blinks up at him for a long, long moment, and then shifts her weight back. Lambert <em>wants</em> to keep her tucked close, but - no. He loosens his arms, lets her back away as far as she likes. If she\u2019s re-thinking this - regretting it - though she doesn\u2019t <em>smell</em> like regret, she still smells like happiness, sweet and almost overwhelming in its intensity -</p>\n<p>She pushes, very gently, at his shoulders; she couldn\u2019t move him even if she <em>shoved</em>, of course, but he backs up, and she follows, guiding him back again, again, until he\u2019s standing in front of one of the benches lining the walls.</p>\n<p>Lambert sits down, because that\u2019s pretty clearly where this is going, and is promptly astonished when Milena <em>sits on his lap</em>.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s light and warm and soft and <em>right there</em> and -</p>\n<p>Well, Lambert suddenly understands why Geralt is always so pleased to have Buttercup on <em>his</em> lap, because there\u2019s something about having Milena so close, tucked into the curve of his arms and the shelter of his body, that\u2019s so utterly satisfying Lambert can\u2019t even put words to the sensation.</p>\n<p>And then <em>she</em> kisses <em>him</em>, and Lambert can\u2019t help the sound that rises from his chest, somewhere between a possessive growl and a pleased purr. It doesn\u2019t seem to bother Milena; she just snuggles <em>closer</em>, utterly unafraid, and makes a happy little noise in return, and Lambert has no idea how to deal with this except for doing his utmost fucking best to make <em>this</em> kiss even better than the first two were.</p>\n<p>And also somehow <em>not</em> think about the way she\u2019s sitting - straddling him, with her knees on either side of his hips, her skirt puddled around them in heaps of soft deep-brown fabric - she\u2019s pressed up against him and he <em>knows</em> she\u2019s wearing stockings but they\u2019re thin silk and he can feel the heat of her legs through <em>his</em> trousers and if - if they ever do this again, if she ever decides she wants more than <em>kisses</em>, it would be so damn easy to just reach down between them and unlace his trousers and lift her up a little and just -</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t think about it</em>. Kissing. Think about kissing.</p>\n<p>Kissing is, in fact, very distracting, and Lambert is going to memorize every one of Milena\u2019s soft happy sounds and how to elicit them if it\u2019s the last thing he does with his long and mostly unpleasant life.</p>\n<p>She finally draws back a little, panting, after what was either a very <em>long</em> third kiss or possibly four or five shorter kisses, and smiles at him so sweetly it makes something in his chest ache. And then she seems to realize the position they\u2019re in - absolutely scandalous, Lambert suspects, in any court but Kaer Morhen - and her ears go pink and she squeaks. Lambert thinks she\u2019ll get up - maybe even flee the room - fuck, he doesn\u2019t want her to go, but he\u2019s sure as fuck not going to <em>grab</em> her -</p>\n<p>And she buries her face against the side of his throat and makes a little giggly happy noise and <em>stays put</em>.</p>\n<p>Lambert is only a Witcher, not a god of self-control, and the way she\u2019s cuddled against him, the back of her neck and the curve of her throat are bared, and he can smell happiness and roses like the best perfume in the whole damn <em>world</em>. He bends his head and buries his nose against her skin, breathing in like he can fucking <em>absorb</em> the smell, can bathe in it, can <em>keep</em> it forever.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not a good enough man to keep from daring a little, little lick. He\u2019s never <em>tasted</em> happiness before. Or roses, come to think of it. Milena\u2019s breath catches, and Lambert closes his eyes and muffles a curse. That was - that was <em>definitely</em> too much, wasn\u2019t it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I taste like?\u201d Milena murmurs.</p>\n<p>Oh fuck, that\u2019s practically <em>permission</em>. \u201cRoses,\u201d Lambert mutters, and presses a kiss to the soft skin beneath his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Milena says, and giggles. \u201cYou know, Zofia warned me that Witchers were prone to <em>biting</em>, not licking.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Zofia</em> warned her - Lambert winces. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat...what did Zofia tell you?\u201d Fuck, fuck, <em>fuck</em> - sure, Zofia\u2019s been around Witchers long enough that she probably <em>does</em> have good advice, but she\u2019s not exactly <em>fond</em> of Lambert, on account of him being kind of an asshole - she could\u2019ve told Milena any <em>number</em> of nasty little things, all of which would be arguably true.</p>\n<p>Milena squeaks, and Lambert can feel her skin heat against his as she blushes <em>very</em> dark. \u201cSome very good advice that I <em>really</em> can\u2019t repeat,\u201d she says, voice high and thin, and the smell of embarrassment almost overwhelms the glorious scent of happiness. \u201cI promise none of it was bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh fuck oh fuck oh <em>fuck</em>, how does he get the happiness-smell back? If Milena is embarrassed she\u2019ll move <em>away</em>, and Lambert is not ready to <em>not</em> have her cuddled up on his lap, trusting and warm and safe and <em>his</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says desperately. \u201cIt\u2019s - I was just curious - <em>fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena giggles, and relaxes, and the sour smell of embarrassment fades away. Oh thank <em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>And really, whatever it was, it can\u2019t have been <em>that</em> bad, right? Not since Milena <em>is</em> here, is in his arms and smelling like roses and happiness, is apparently -</p>\n<p>Is apparently in love with him.</p>\n<p>Lambert has <em>no fucking clue</em> how he got this lucky, but whatever it was, it must\u2019ve been <em>really</em> fucking good, if it earned him this moment - this whole fucking <em>afternoon</em> - fuck, if this is what reciting poetry earns him, he\u2019ll fucking well memorize it <em>all</em>.</p>\n<p>Milena has been part of the White Wolf\u2019s court for two months, and really she thinks she\u2019s settling in quite well. Her days have fallen into a comfortable pattern: get up in the early grey light of dawn and head down to the hot springs to bathe and gossip with Jaskier and Triss and Lady Yennefer and sometimes Zofia. Breakfast in the great hall, followed by morning lessons with Ciri: maths and history and geography, languages and court etiquette and sewing, music theory and household management and anything else that Ciri\u2019s quicksilver mind latches onto; Milena brings her embroidery up and sews while they\u2019re talking, and has so far adorned three tunics for Zofia, four dresses for Ciri, a very nice doublet for Jaskier, three handkerchiefs for Triss, and several scarves for herself, and is working on a belt for Lady Yennefer. She hasn\u2019t quite figured out what to make for Lambert yet, but she\u2019s got time. After lessons, dinner in the great hall again, and then a few hours either helping Lady Yennefer with the Warlord\u2019s correspondence or Triss with her brewing - Milena doesn\u2019t precisely <em>enjoy</em> working with the foul things Triss puts into her potions, but it\u2019s good to feel <em>useful</em>.</p>\n<p>And then the best part of her day: the hours with Lambert. Talking, learning, laughing. <em>Kissing</em>. Since her birthday, they\u2019ve spent a <em>lot</em> of time kissing. Lambert seems astonished and delighted every time, as though he\u2019s <em>still</em> surprised that she enjoys his company - that she loves him.</p>\n<p>Milena still can\u2019t quite believe that she dared to <em>say</em> that to him. Gently-bred young ladies don\u2019t just confess their love like that. But she\u2019s of Kaer Morhen now, and Witchers say what they mean.</p>\n<p>Or just swear a lot. They do that, too.</p>\n<p>So yes, hours with Lambert - she\u2019s getting quite good with a dagger, actually - and then supper, and then dancing or singing or watching the Witchers brawl, which was extremely startling the first few times but is now just...a thing that happens, because Witchers are <em>ridiculous</em>, and then Lambert walks her up to her rooms and kisses her goodnight.</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s starting to think she might want more than <em>kissing</em>, one of these days. <em>Soon</em>, even. She\u2019s not in Redania any more: her maidenhead is not a bargaining chip, not a way to drive up the price of her inevitable miserable marriage. It\u2019s hers to give wherever she pleases, because Ciri certainly isn\u2019t going to arrange her marriage, and the White Wolf isn\u2019t either. Really, no one in Kaer Morhen cares <em>who</em> she sleeps with - or doesn\u2019t sleep with - as long as no one\u2019s being pressured into anything, as Jaskier quite bluntly informed her some weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Given that her liege lady and liege lords don\u2019t have any particular opinions either way, then, Milena only has two real concerns about - well, about the sorts of things <em>proper</em> young ladies don\u2019t even think about until their wedding nights.</p>\n<p>The first is that she...isn\u2019t entirely sure Lambert <em>wants</em> to do more than kiss. He certainly hasn\u2019t <em>said</em> anything. On the other hand, he always seems so astonished that she wants to <em>kiss</em> him that maybe he doesn\u2019t think she <em>wants</em> anything more, and as prickly and generally crude as he can be, he tries so hard to be a gentleman with her.</p>\n<p>The second is that she doesn\u2019t have more than a very, very broad idea of what to <em>do</em>. She knows only the most basic outline of how bedsport <em>works</em>, because a young noble lady isn\u2019t expected to know more than that. She\u2019d rather like to know at least a <em>little</em> more of what to expect before she...does anything.</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t, so far as she can tell, anything in Kaer Morhen\u2019s library that\u2019s really relevant. If she wanted to learn to kill any sort of monster, make any sort of potion, or learn any sort of history, she\u2019d be in luck, but alas almost every <em>other</em> subject is utterly lacking.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not quite bold enough to ask Jaskier and Triss and Lady Yennefer for <em>advice</em>, or not yet at least, though they\u2019ve gotten a lot less careful about how bawdy their jokes and gossip are, and she\u2019s learned several things just from <em>listening</em>. But that\u2019s not <em>quite</em> enough, not really.</p>\n<p>And then one morning Jaskier comes down to the baths bubbling over with glee, and explains that he\u2019s just gotten a crate of books from a very <em>particular</em> bookseller in Oxenfurt. Lady Yennefer\u2019s eyes light up, and Jaskier promises, laughing, that he\u2019ll lend her several.</p>\n<p>Milena swallows hard and says, feeling her ears burning, \u201cMight I borrow one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier cocks his head at her and smiles, kind and gentle. \u201cOf course you can. Shall I choose one that\u2019s...fairly simple?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Milena says.</p>\n<p>Jaskier hands her a book after dinner, and Milena squirrels it away in her rooms before going to assist Lady Yennefer and spend her usual afternoon with Lambert. Every time she gets something right in dagger training, he kisses her; every time he gets her braids right, she kisses him. They\u2019re both improving <em>very</em> fast. At fighting and braiding, too.</p>\n<p>Jaskier sings after supper, which is usually enough to keep Milena\u2019s attention, but the thought of the book is like a thorn pricking at her mind. She makes it through three songs before she catches Lambert\u2019s eye and slips away.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d Lambert asks anxiously as he catches up to her at the door and offers his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not ill?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena smiles up at him and tucks herself closer, enjoying the heat and strength of his arm under her hand. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. \u201cJust a little tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert frowns at her, and Milena sighs. Witcher senses and the ability to smell <em>lies</em>. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m not tired,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a book I really want to read.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re blushing,\u201d Lambert observes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask?\u201d Milena begs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lambert says, looking baffled. \u201cI\u2019m not asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Milena says, and goes up on her toes to kiss his cheek. Lambert\u2019s cheeks go pink. \u201cI <em>will</em> tell you, I think - just not tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert kisses her goodnight at her door, and Milena curls up in bed and opens the slender book. There\u2019s no title on the cover, and no author listed, and it\u2019s hand-written, not printed, in a very pretty copperplate hand.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also <em>filthy</em>. Milena only makes it through the first three pages before she has to close it and blink at the curtains of her bed in baffled astonishment. Zofia\u2019s matter-of-fact advice about <em>mouths </em>is suddenly <em>much</em> clearer.</p>\n<p>She stays up very late that night, and Jaskier kindly doesn\u2019t tease her at all for her bleary eyes the next morning in the baths. Lady Yennefer laughs at her, not very meanly, and says, \u201cSo, planning to trip your Witcher into bed, then, my girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena <em>does</em> blush, but not as badly as she used to two months ago. \u201cQuite possibly,\u201d she says, with as much dignity as she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Triss says, patting Milena on the shoulder. \u201cHave fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena blushes all the way through breakfast, but thankfully, has it under control by the time she heads up the stairs to Ciri\u2019s rooms. She does <em>not</em> want the little princess joining <em>this</em> teasing.</p>\n<p>That night Jaskier plays dancing music, and Milena spends a pleasant hour in Lambert\u2019s arms, whirling around the great hall happily. Lambert has gotten to be a <em>very</em> good dancer, and he\u2019s easily strong enough to lift Milena or twirl her or dip her, and she never fears he\u2019ll drop her.</p>\n<p>He walks her up to her rooms at the end of the night, and Milena takes a deep breath and looks up to meet surprisingly comforting amber eyes. She\u2019s gotten used to the slitted pupils; it\u2019s rather flattering, now, to see them blown nearly round whenever he looks at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you,\u201d she says, and hesitates. A lock of her hair has come loose during the dancing; Lambert coils it around his finger, smiling down at her, waiting.</p>\n<p>Her choice, as it never would have been in Redania; her choice, because asshole though he may be, Lambert won\u2019t ever ask for more than she cares to give.</p>\n<p>Her choice, and she <em>wants</em> him, prickly and foul-mouthed as he may be - because he has never been anything but sweet to <em>her</em>, and she loves him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s pupils go so wide she can barely see the amber around them, and he makes a tiny squeaking noise that she\u2019s pretty sure he didn\u2019t mean to let out. He takes a deep breath, and licks his lips, and says, \u201cOh fuck, you\u2019re <em>sure</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena nods.</p>\n<p>Lambert kisses her hungrily, and fumbles behind her for the door, shoving it open clumsily. Milena laughs against his mouth and backs up, leading him in, and Lambert kicks the door shut behind him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Milena\u2019s not sure what she expected, really. The astonishing filthy book had a <em>lot</em> of ideas, and the cheerful gossip she\u2019s heard from Jaskier and Lady Yennefer and Triss has provided a great many more, and of course there\u2019s always Zofia\u2019s blunt advice -</p>\n<p>But really, given how Lambert has treated her pretty much since the day he carried her down a mountain, swearing all the way and holding her like fine porcelain, she should have guessed it would be -</p>\n<p>Gentle and overwhelming and <em>sweet</em>, and full of swearing.</p>\n<p>Lambert helps her undo the long line of buttons down the back of her dress, and fumbles at several of them - his thick fingers are so dextrous with weapons, but her buttons are tiny pearls, slippery and delicate - and he swears in four languages while she laughs. And then, when she turns and lets the dress fall and kicks off her slippers, leaving her in chemise and stockings and underskirt, thin silk and linen that conceals very little, he makes a sound like a wounded animal and buries his face against the curve of her throat, licking at her skin and whispering curses in tones of utter awe, arms tight around her.</p>\n<p>Even six months ago, before the White Wolf came to Redania and Milena met Jaskier, the idea of being wrapped up in a Witcher\u2019s embrace would have been <em>terrifying</em>. The stuff of nightmares. Now - now she\u2019s held safe and warm, and the hands that have slain countless monsters are spread across her back so gently they\u2019re almost hesitant, and she doesn\u2019t want to be anywhere but here.</p>\n<p>And it has to be her leading, because Lambert won\u2019t push - doesn\u2019t dare, and she\u2019s starting to understand that her big strong Witcher who fears nothing is afraid that he\u2019ll manage to scare <em>her</em>, that if he does something wrong she\u2019ll go back to believing that Witchers are terrifying monsters. Darling ridiculous man, prickly and foul-mouthed and so sweet underneath it\u2019s almost painful to see.</p>\n<p>So she hugs him, hard, and steps back, and pulls off her chemise, and Lambert squeaks the way he did the first time she asked him to dance, and his pupils go entirely round and so large she can barely see the amber of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you,\u201d she says, and he tugs off his shirt without taking his eyes away from her, drops it behind him carelessly.</p>\n<p>His chest is broad and scarred, marked by a hundred hunts and battles; any mortal man would have been dead a dozen times over, but on Lambert the scars have healed to pale lines, slight ridges. She wants to trace every one of them with her fingers, wants to kiss them. Wants, maybe, to lick - he seems to like the way <em>her</em> skin tastes, maybe she\u2019ll like his.</p>\n<p>But first, she tugs loose the strings of her underskirt, and lets it fall. Lambert\u2019s eyes follow it down, and come back up again <em>slowly</em>, like he\u2019s memorizing every inch of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you,\u201d Milena says again, more softly than she meant to, and Lambert tries to take off his pants without remembering to unlace his boots first, and Milena has to sit down on the bed and <em>laugh</em> while he sits on the floor and wrestles with his bootlaces and swears.</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t be nervous when it\u2019s just - it\u2019s <em>them</em>. Laughter and kisses and swearing, and Lambert trying so very, very hard not to scare her, when she doesn\u2019t think he even <em>could</em> anymore. Other Witchers, maybe, but she\u2019ll never be scared of <em>her</em> Wolf again.</p>\n<p>A naked man\u2019s not as imposing as she had worried, when he\u2019s on his knees in front of her, looking up at her with blown-dark eyes and grinning like the wolf he is. \u201cYou smell so <em>good</em>,\u201d he says, and reaches for her - and hesitates, waiting, until she takes his hands and presses them to her waist, smiles down at him and nods permission.</p>\n<p>Lambert pulls her to the edge of the bed, her knees spread wide by his broad shoulders, and breathes in. \u201cSalt and roses,\u201d he says - <em>growls</em>, really, and Milena shivers at the sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d she says, a little shakily.</p>\n<p>Lambert licks his lips. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s looking at her like he can\u2019t believe she\u2019s <em>real</em>. His hands are broad and warm, almost spanning her waist entirely. The slight roughness of the scars on his arms catches a little against the silk stockings she is still, improbably, wearing.</p>\n<p>Witchers say what they mean, and Milena is learning to do the same. \u201cI don\u2019t entirely know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she admits quietly. \u201cIs there - what do <em>you</em> want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to taste you,\u201d Lambert rumbles.</p>\n<p>Milena reaches out, slow and careful, to run her fingers through his short-cropped hair, down over the scars on his cheek. He turns his head to kiss her palm. \u201cGo on, then,\u201d she whispers.</p>\n<p>To her surprise, he licks a stripe along her inner thigh, and makes a low pleased noise at the taste. Milena giggles from the sheer <em>unexpectedness</em> of it, and Lambert makes another pleased noise and then leans forward and buries his face between her thighs.</p>\n<p>Milena <em>yelps</em>, shocked and delighted, and says a word she learned from Lambert himself. Lambert laughs, which is a really, truly astonishing sensation just now. And then it\u2019s just - overwhelming, genuinely <em>overwhelming</em>, and Milena makes a fist in the sheets and rests her other hand shakily on Lambert\u2019s head and gasps shocked pleasure to the stone walls. Oh - this - yes, Zofia was <em>completely</em> right in saying this was a good idea - and so was the astonishing book - and - really she ought to have expected this given how much he seems to like <em>licking</em> her -</p>\n<p>Milena surprises herself quite thoroughly with the sound she makes as the warmth in the pit of her stomach turns to shocking, limb-shaking pleasure.</p>\n<p>Lambert looks very, very smug. Milena laughs breathlessly at the smirk he\u2019s wearing, the cocky tilt to his head. \u201cGet up here and kiss me,\u201d she says, and Lambert stands and does so. She can taste what must be her own salt on his lips, and it\u2019s shocking and scandalous and she doesn\u2019t mind at all.</p>\n<p>She runs her hands down his chest, tracing the scars, wondering at the softness of his skin. He twitches, just a little, as she trails her fingers down over his stomach, tracing the line of a particularly nasty scar. Milena pauses, glances up at his face, and moves her fingers again, brushing lightly against his skin. Lambert makes a tiny strangled noise and twitches again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>ticklish</em>,\u201d Milena says, delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cWitchers aren\u2019t ticklish, that\u2019s absurd -\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena runs her fingers up over his ribs, and Lambert squawks and flinches.</p>\n<p>\u201cTicklish,\u201d Milena says, grinning. It makes him far more human, somehow - far more <em>touchable</em>, that he should have so simple a weakness.</p>\n<p>Lambert drops his head to her shoulder. \u201c<em>Please</em>,\u201d he says desperately, \u201cyou can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one knows?\u201d Milena asks, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI convinced everyone the Trials burned it out of me,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cFuck, <em>please</em>, Milena. If Eskel or Geralt or fucking <em>Gweld</em> finds out, I\u2019ll never have a moment\u2019s peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Milena says, firmly suppressing a giggle. \u201cTell you a secret,\u201d she adds softly, and Lambert hums a question. \u201cI am too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert breathes a laugh against her skin and raises his head to kiss her again. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur secret,\u201d Milena agrees, and it\u2019s that - that simple silly <em>joy</em>, the laughter and trust that they share even now, that makes it easy and utterly terrorless to look down and reach out and wrap one hand around his prick, just to see how it feels.</p>\n<p>Lambert makes a strangled noise and drops his head to her shoulder again, and his hands to the sheets, and twists the fabric so tightly in his fists she\u2019s a little worried he\u2019ll tear it as she moves her hand in slow, experimental strokes. For long moments he lets her do exactly as she pleases, gasping tiny desperate noises against her skin, and then she must do something <em>very</em> wrong or possibly <em>very</em> right, because he growls, low and loud, and moves so fast it\u2019s a bit of a blur, and she finds herself on her back on the bed with him looming over her, caging her in, broad shoulders and sturdy arms and a look of wild hunger on his face.</p>\n<p>It should maybe be terrifying, but it\u2019s <em>Lambert</em>, and she\u2019s always safe in his arms. He seems to realize what he\u2019s done after a moment, and his eyes go wide and he starts to move away. Milena wraps a hand around his arm - her fingers don\u2019t come anywhere <em>close</em> to reaching around his wrist - and he could break her hold with a thought, but he freezes like she\u2019s pinned him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she says, and he swallows hard and settles back into place above her, huge and warm and <em>safe</em>.</p>\n<p>Well. If being about a hair\u2019s breadth from losing her maidenhead counts as safe. Which...in Kaer Morhen...it does. Because it\u2019s hers to give, if she wants, and she <em>does</em> want. And she\u2019s definitely not going to lie back and think of heirs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cFuck, anything you want, just tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena savors the word on her tongue before she says it. \u201cFuck. Yes. That. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert kisses her, breathing curses like love-names into her mouth, and Milena laughs against his lips and wraps her legs around his waist and does not think of heirs at all - does not think of anything but lust, and joy, and love.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jaskier says, propping his elbows on the sides of the pool and giving Milena and Lambert a long look full of affection and amusement. \u201cI\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a reason Lambert is <em>here</em> on this fine morning, and not, say, still in his nice warm bed, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Milena blushes. Lambert wraps his arms a little more snugly around her waist and says, \u201cOh, fuck off, Buttercup. And stop <em>smirking</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShan\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says amiably. \u201cI am going to be incredibly smug about having been partially responsible for this absolutely adorable relationship for <em>months</em>, and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>dreadful</em>,\u201d Milena says, but she can\u2019t help laughing. Lambert\u2019s chest, pressed to her back, shakes with silent laughter too. \u201cThank you, my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier goes pink. \u201cOh, that\u2019s not fair,\u201d he says, covering his face with one hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be all - genuinely grateful! Dreadful woman. Absolutely horrible. You deserve each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Milena says, and turns her head, and Lambert catches her lips in a kiss. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p>"
