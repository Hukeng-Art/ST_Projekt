  "summary": "<p>John is a Kindergarten teacher. One of his students, a boy named Henry Holmes, refuses to speak in school.

  "notes": "<p>Translation into Russian available: <a href=\"http://ficbook.net/readfic/2049039\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learning Curve</a> by <a href=\"http://ficbook.net/authors/Cub+Fox\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cub Fox</a></p>\n<p>This is my first attempt at any sort of parentlock, but I couldn't get this idea out of my head. I'm a teacher, so I figured...write what you know, haha. This is set somewhere in the United States because I'm familiar with the curriculum here. </p>\n<p>I'd really like it if you readers would leave me comments about things you'd like to see happen in the story. I'm very open to suggestions! </p>\n<p>I might change the rating later on, but for now it's General Audiences.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Updates won't usually be this frequent, but I get impatient and like to post things right when I finish them haha.</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions about what you'd like to see, let me know in the comments!</p>\n<p>As always, I'd love to hear about things you guys would like to see happen!</p>\n<p>I swear there will be more John/Sherlock interaction next chapter. Thanks for sticking with me! I'm on vacation so the next chapter will be up on July 7th at the earliest, but probably a few days after that.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has been reading and commenting. I really appreciate the feedback!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://secretmanlove.tumblr.com/post/55484349375/a-lil-parentlock-doodle-inspired-by-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Art for this chapter</a> by <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/tallenough/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stitchy</a>!</p>\n<p>This was meant to be the 'John comes to dinner' chapter but things got away from me, so that'll be in the next chapter!</p>\n<p>Sorry for the delay everyone! I'm currently busy with two jobs, side projects, and moving so it makes it a little difficult to find good writing time. However, this chapter is about 1000 words longer than the longest chapter up until this point so I hope that makes up for it! </p>\n<p>You can follow me on tumblr for progress updates if you like; my username is allfinehere there as well. </p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/tallenough/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stitchy</a> made <a href=\"https://secretmanlove.tumblr.com/post/55484349375/a-lil-parentlock-doodle-inspired-by-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">art for this fic</a>!

And as always, thank you for your comments and suggestions!</p>\n<p>Hey all! Thanks for picking up on the mistakes I made last chapter and letting me know. If I did any more dumb things this chapter, please tell me! And as always, if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them!</p>\n<p>This chapter was kind of tough. I'm glad to be done with it and moving on!</p>\n<p>Sorry everyone, this chapter's really short. Had a bit of a rough week and writing took a back seat to other things. Hopefully I can make up for it with next week's chapter!</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for all your support last week; you guys are fantastic! I really appreciated all the comments and encouragement.</p>\n<p>Just a reminder that I'm allfinehere on Tumblr, and I sometimes post previews and updates there.</p>\n<p>Attempting to move on with the plot and not get caught up in too many little details! I don't want this to end up being a fic that drags on way too long.</p>\n<p>Many apologies for not posting last week! I work two jobs so I usually write on the weekend, but I had family visiting and was participating in a craft show so I had no time to write. Hopefully in this chapter I've addressed some of the issues brought up in the comments on the last chapter. Thank you all for your continued comments and readership! You're awesome!</p>\n<p>Well darlings, this chapter boosts the fic's rating to M. If you prefer not to read that sort of stuff, it's pretty obvious where it starts up so you can just skip the rest of the chapter. Any helpful suggestions for improvements are welcome!</p>\n<p>In other news, I got a full-time sub job as a Kindergarten TA, which I am excited about. However, it might mean less writing time so I might miss a week here and there. You can check my tumblr (allfinehere) for posting updates.</p>\n<p>Super short chapter this week because that's all I could get done.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I've received lots of comments about how Thanksgiving isn't celebrated in the UK. However, this story is set in the US and we're all about the turkey over here :)</p>\n<p>Once again, I just want to make sure that everyone is clear on the fact that this is an American AU. We very much celebrate Thanksgiving here.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Apparently this chapter posted 3 times, but everything's been fixed. Sorry for the confusion!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_20_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for all the angst! I promise it will get better!</p>\n<p>Apologies for the delay! I think this is the longest chapter so far, so hopefully that makes up for it :) I think next chapter will be the last one, which is a little sad but it will be nice for this to be a completed work. Thanks for sticking with me!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_21_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>The insponsible/repossible thing actually happened in my classroom last week, in case anyone was in disbelief about it ;)</p>\n<p>Also, I realize that I very conveniently got rid of Moriarty, but I just couldn't do the angst haha. So if it was too unrealistic to you, please just suspend your disbelief and look forward to the next chapter ;)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_22_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Ahaha forgive me for the most cliche ending of all time. Anyway, thank you all so much for following the story (despite the many delays) and for your comments and kudos! I really appreciate your dedication, and I hope you enjoyed the last chapter! &lt;3</p>",
  "text": "<p>Fingers tapped out an uneven rhythm as John listened to the phone ring on the other end, waiting for someone to pick up. At least he hadn\u2019t had to call relatives and emergency contacts due to a disconnected number, which happened far too often for his liking. In the middle of the fifth ring, there was an answer.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello?\u201d asked a deep, resonant voice which took John by surprise, though he wasn\u2019t quite sure why.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, hi, this is John Watson. Am I speaking to Mr. Holmes?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou are,\u201d he replied, and then silence reigned on the other end of the line.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood, right. I\u2019m your son\u2019s teacher,\u201d John began. Unfortunately, it had to be said because parental involvement was low and some parents simply didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, I am aware,\u201d came the cool reply. Well, that was at least hopeful for what John had to say.</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course. I\u2019m calling because Henry - well, to be quite frank, I haven\u2019t heard him speak a single word. It\u2019s not unusual for children to be quiet the first few weeks of Kindergarten while they adjust to their new classmates and surroundings, but I haven\u2019t heard him say so much as \u2018hello.\u2019 Does he speak at home at all?\u201d John asked. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, certainly. Incessantly, in fact,\u201d Mr. Holmes replied, with no further explanation. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, well...that\u2019s good to know,\u201d John replied, at a loss as to how to continue the conversation as Mr. Holmes didn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cI was wondering if we might meet - with Henry there, of course - to discuss some ways to get him more vocally involved in the classroom.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Mr. Watson. Thank you for your concern, though. Henry will see you tomorrow.\u201d That being said, he hung up. </p>\n<p> John listened to the dial tone in slight shock for a few seconds before hanging up his own phone. He could not fathom why Mr. Holmes didn\u2019t seem to be concerned about the fact that his son had decided to be selectively mute at school. It would inhibit his learning and his ability to make friends, and he was at an age where successful interactions with peers were just as important as being able to recite and recognize the alphabet. </p>\n<p> Sighing, he picked up a stack of papers. It was Thursday, which meant he needed to go through the completed assignments from the week so they could go home with the students the next day. He got out a blue stamp pad and a stamp with a smiling star that said \u201cGreat Work!\u201d for the assignments that had been completed properly and got started. While he worked, he thought about ways he might get Henry to start speaking. The boy seemed perfectly content to work and play on his own, so getting one of the more outgoing students to befriend him probably wouldn\u2019t be successful. They would be starting a unit on family soon, though, so perhaps John could get Henry to talk about his family. And if he did, that might unravel some mysteries about his father as well.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Several days later the kids were working on little books describing different roles in their families. On each page they were supposed to draw pictures of someone in their family doing a certain job. John had been teaching them how to draw people that weren\u2019t simple stick figures, and was pleased with what he saw as he walked around the room. When he arrived at the Tiger table (each table group was named after an animal), he was surprised to see that Henry had done nothing but write his name on the front of his book. Unlike most of the kids, Henry already knew how to write his name perfectly. His printing was a little shaky, but there were no backwards letters or mixed-up lowercase and uppercase letters. John had encouraged the kids to label their pictures and had been excited to see what Henry would do. At this stage, most kids would write a letter or two to represent a word, but Henry had shown promise in the beginning of the year assessments. However, his paper remained blank.</p>\n<p> John crouched down next to him. \u201cReady to get started, Henry?\u201d he asked. Henry looked at him with large, serious grey eyes but gave no reply. John opened the booklet to the first page. The page said \u2018Mom\u2019 at the top and had a blank space underneath to draw a picture. \u201cSo what\u2019s something your mom likes to do?\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry stared at the paper and gave no answer. John tried again. \u201cDoes she make you breakfast?\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry shook his head. </p>\n<p> \u201cAll right,\u201d John replied. \u201cDoes she take you to the park?\u201d </p>\n<p> Again, Henry shook his head.</p>\n<p> \u201cDoes she play with you?\u201d </p>\n<p> Negative.</p>\n<p> John thought for a minute, then held his hands out palm-up. \u201cWho helps you get ready for school in the morning? Mommy?\u201d he asked, gesturing with his his right hand, \u201cor Daddy?\u201d he asked, gesturing with his left hand. </p>\n<p> Henry immediately reached out and touched John\u2019s left hand. Since that method had been successful, John asked another question. \u201cDoes Mommy or Daddy make dinner?\u201d Again, Henry touched John\u2019s left hand. John was relieved; finally he was getting somewhere. He asked one of his original questions, feeling he knew what the answer would be. \u201cWho takes you to the park?\u201d Henry touched John\u2019s left hand once more, looking almost bored with the little interview. </p>\n<p> \u201cOkay Henry, how about you just skip this first page and move on to the next one,\u201d John suggested kindly. \u201cRemember when we were all talking together and I said if you don\u2019t have to do a page if that person isn\u2019t a part of your family?\u201d he reminded the boy. Henry nodded in reply. The second page said \u2018Dad\u2019 at the top, and Henry eagerly grabbed his pencil and got to work. </p>\n<p> It looked like another phone call to Mr. Holmes was in order, and John was not particularly looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When all the students had left and John had tidied up the room and set out the warm-up work for the next day, he looked up Mr. Holmes\u2019s number and dialed. This time the phone was picked up on the second ring. </p>\n<p> \u201cMr. Watson,\u201d said the voice on the other end that took John by surprise a second time, which was silly since he knew what to expect.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, hello Mr. Holmes,\u201d John began, determined not to be a pushover this time. \u201cI\u2019m calling because Henry had a bit of trouble with one of his assignments today.\u201d</p>\n<p> There was a slight pause. \u201cTrouble? I find that hard to believe. Henry is very intelligent.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really to do with intelligence.\u201d John hesitated, then continued. \u201cI know this is a personal question, but is Henry\u2019s mother in the picture? I only ask because we were working on a family booklet and he had nothing to write for the \u2018mom\u2019 page. I told the kids it was fine to skip pages if that person wasn\u2019t involved in their family, but he seemed particularly troubled by it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo. She is not,\u201d Mr. Holmes replied shortly. \u201cTell me, Mr. Watson. If Henry does not speak in school, how did you gather enough evidence to call me with this issue?\u201d</p>\n<p> That was an odd way to put it, John thought. Gathering evidence? \u201cI asked him questions and gave him two options for answers, one associated with my right hand and one with my left,\u201d John explained. \u201cHe picked the hand with the answer he wanted to give.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHm. I think we should meet to discuss this in person,\u201d Mr. Holmes replied. </p>\n<p> John rolled his eyes. Hadn\u2019t he suggested that last week? \u201cYes, all right. Can you meet after school tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThat would be acceptable. I will see you then.\u201d That being said, he hung up the phone. </p>\n<p> John rubbed his hands over his face, palms rasping against his stubble. This wasn\u2019t going to be an easy meeting, but at least he might get to the bottom of whatever was going on with Henry.</p>\n<p>The following day went by quickly and uneventfully, and John was wiping down the tables as the kids left when he remembered he was supposed to be meeting with Mr. Holmes after school. He hastily took down chairs and set them up at the Meerkat table, then grabbed a few papers, a notebook, and a pen from his desk and placed them at the table.</p>\n<p>Peering out into the hallway, John spotted Henry talking to a tall, dark-haired man with curls that matched Henry\u2019s. \u201cMr. Holmes?\u201d John asked as he stepped out of the room.</p>\n<p>The man looked up and gave John a polite smile that did not reach his eyes. \u201cYes, Mr. Watson. We have a meeting today, I believe?\u201d he asked in a manner that implied it wasn\u2019t a question at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, come on in,\u201d John replied, inviting them into the room. \u201cAnd you can call me John, if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSherlock,\u201d the man replied as he surveyed the room with a calculating glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the conference room is booked today, so we\u2019ll be talking in here. Sorry about the chairs,\u201d he said with an apologetic smile, motioning to the Kindergartner-sized chairs. They weren\u2019t much of a issue for John, but they might prove difficult for someone of Sherlock\u2019s height.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Sherlock replied, sitting and managing to make it look as if he were at comfortably at ease in the undersized chair.</p>\n<p>Henry was standing at his dad\u2019s side, hands clutched around the straps of his backpack. His gaze flickered back and forth between John and Sherlock, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the situation. However, he voiced no concern. John had been hoping he might speak now that his dad was there, but no such luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can go get out some toys if you want, Henry,\u201d John suggested. \u201cOr you could sit here with us. Whichever you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Henry looked uncertainly at his dad, who nodded and gave him a warm smile. Henry gave him a tiny smile in return, then dropped his backpack and headed straight for the shelf with the magnet tiles. He got the tub out, but brought it back to the Meerkat table and proceeded to dump the contents at Sherlock\u2019s feet, where he sat and began building.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d John began. \u201cSo I was -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, John,\u201d Sherlock interrupted smoothly. \u201cWhy does a man go from being a soldier to being a teacher? Obviously you were invalided out of the army, but why choose teaching small children as a career?\u201d</p>\n<p>John\u2019s response should have been something along the lines of \u2018I believe we\u2019re here to discuss your son today, not my career choices.\u2019 What he said instead was, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sherlock smirked. \u201cThe pictures you\u2019ve got on your desk. You\u2019re in uniform in a few, but you\u2019re much younger. And the postcard from your friend who\u2019s been deployed again. You hold your left shoulder more stiffly than your right.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSimple enough to figure out that bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>To Sherlock\u2019s apparent surprise, John smiled. \u201cI should tell you off for being nosy, but that...well, that was amazing,\u201d John admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what people usually say,\u201d Sherlock said with a half-smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. They generally respond with things unsuitable for little ears,\u201d Sherlock replied with a glance at his son, who was busily constructing some sort of fortress.</p>\n<p>John laughed. \u201cFair enough. To be honest, after I got shot and sent home I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I was going out of my mind sitting in my apartment all day, so I started volunteering in my sister\u2019s kids\u2019 school. I liked working with kids, so I went back to school to become a teacher and here I am.\u201d He shrugged, fiddling with his pen. \u201cSo, what made you reconsider meeting me?\u201d he asked, shifting focus to the reason they were currently sitting at a tiny table in tiny chairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes. As you know, Henry does not speak outside of home. On occasion he will nod or shake his head to answer a stranger\u2019s questions, but those are rare. You can imagine, therefore, that I was intrigued to find out that he not only answered your questions, but took a more active role in choosing an answer,\u201d Sherlock replied, folding his hands and resting them on his legs. \u201cIt seems you are a unique man, John,\u201d he said, gazing levelly at John with piercing blue-green eyes. That in combination with his last statement threw John a little off course.</p>\n<p>\u201cI - um, well I don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he deflected. \u201cBut I\u2019m certainly glad he\u2019s shown a willingness to communicate. I can make accommodations for him, but school is going to be difficult for him if he remains selectively mute,\u201d John said seriously.</p>\n<p>Going through the papers in front of him, John pulled out the small family booklet they had been working on and handed it to Sherlock. \u201cHere\u2019s what we were working on the other day. The kids were allowed to leave the pages that didn\u2019t apply to their families blank. Take a look at the page for \u2018dad\u2019,\u201d John said with a smile.</p>\n<p>There was a <a href=\"http://i62.photobucket.com/albums/h112/ebunny7/LearningCurve_1_zpsec2b6ba0.png\">carefully drawn and colored picture of Sherlock</a> wearing a blue shirt, black pants, and black shoes. He wore a smile and held what looked like a microscope in his hand, which was confirmed by the label Henry wrote: \u2018mikroskop\u2019. There were also a few glass beakers (cups) and what appeared to be an animal head wearing headphones in the background (moos). The drawing of Sherlock was holding a violin (viulin) in his other hand.</p>\n<p>John watched Sherlock as he studied the picture. The man smiled as he observed what his son drew, pride showing on his features. \u201cIt\u2019s all very accurate,\u201d he commented. \u201cBrilliant job, Henry,\u201d he said to his son, who looked up and beamed at him momentarily before continuing construction on his project.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is brilliant,\u201d John repeated. \u201cHis ability to discern sounds in words is far above what we\u2019d expect from Kindergartners at the beginning of the year. His attention to detail in the picture is fantastic, too. Do you two work on things at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe read quite a lot,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cI sometimes do observational drawings for my work and Henry wanted to try too, so I set him up with his own little drawing kit,\u201d Sherlock added. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten quite good. He practices nearly every day,\u201d he said, a note of pride returning to his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you a scientist?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf sorts. I like to conduct experiments in my spare time, and I\u2019ll sometimes do them for cases. I\u2019m a consulting detective,\u201d he explained.</p>\n<p>John looked confused. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t heard of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m the only one, so far as I can tell,\u201d Sherlock replied nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo...is that like a private detective?\u201d John asked, still confused.</p>\n<p>Sherlock smirked. \u201cNo. The police consult me when they get out of their depth. Which is often.\u201d</p>\n<p>John nodded, then realized they had strayed off topic for the second time. \u201cGetting back to the booklet there, I was wondering if you might tell me a bit more about Henry\u2019s mother, if it isn\u2019t too private. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s just you and him at home?\u201d John asked carefully.</p>\n<p>Sherlock confirmed with a quick nod. \u201cYes. His mother signed over all parental rights to me after he was born. She doesn\u2019t wish to be a part of either of our lives. I...had thought that Henry understood and was okay with things as they were, but apparently I was mistaken,\u201d Sherlock said, then pressed his lips together in a tight line.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeginning Kindergarten can be a bit of a cultural shock for kids,\u201d John said gently. \u201cThey become suddenly aware that not every family is like theirs and it can be disorienting. You could talk with him about it at home,\u201d John suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to handle it on this end, but I\u2019m not sure how far I\u2019ll get without him actually speaking to me. He might just need some more time to adjust to school and his classmates,\u201d John said lightly, though he was aware that the issue could be deeper. \u201cI could make up a list of books on the topic you two could read together,\u201d he offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sherlock replied, sounding a little surprised. \u201cI appreciate your willingness to help my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>John smiled. \u201cThink nothing of it. Just doing my job.\u201d He looked down at Henry\u2019s creation. \u201cDid you build a castle to keep out the dragons?\u201d</p>\n<p>Henry shook his head and frowned slightly, looking at John expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh...to keep out people?\u201d John ventured.</p>\n<p>Smiling, Henry scooted to John\u2019s side and picked up John\u2019s hands, arranging them so they were both palm-up. Glancing over, John noted that Sherlock was watching with intense interest. \u201cAll right, you want a choice,\u201d John began. \u201cIs the castle for dragons, or for people?\u201d he asked, motioning with each hand for each choice.</p>\n<p>With a grin, Henry picked John\u2019s right hand for \u2018dragons.\u2019 \u201cA castle <em>for</em> dragons. Interesting choice,\u201d John laughed. \u201cI think your dad and I are about done talking, so could you clean up?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a dramatic smash, Henry\u2019s castle came toppling down and John returned his attention to Sherlock, who was staring at him as if he\u2019d performed some great feat. \u201cWell, unless there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like to discuss, I think we\u2019re all set. You can take the family book home with you, and I\u2019ll send home a list of books with Henry tomorrow. Sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sherlock nodded as he helped Henry put his backpack on. \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d he replied. \u201cReady to go home?\u201d he asked Henry, who nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, Henry,\u201d John called as the pair walked out the door. Henry turned to wave goodbye, and then they were gone. With a small smile on his face, John sat down at his computer to compose a list.</p>\n<p>When they arrived home, Sherlock retrieved Henry\u2019s take-home folder from his backpack, as he did every day to check for any notes. Today there was a short newsletter printed on mint green paper.</p>\n<p>Dear Families,</p>\n<p> This past week we began a unit on families, where we have been learning about different kinds of people that make up a family, their roles, what it means to be a family, and that not everyone\u2019s family is the same. So far the students have come up with a lot of great observations and questions, which we will discover the answers to as a class (see reverse side for our KWL chart - the kids can tell you what it means!). Below I have listed some websites and books you might want to check out for further information and discussion as a family. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Have a great week!<br>\nMr. Watson</p>\n<p> Sherlock flipped the paper over to look at the chart. \u201cHenry, what is a \u2018KWL chart?\u2019\u201d he asked as he read.</p>\n<p> Henry looked up from the apple slices he was busily munching. \u201cOh, that\u2019s for seeing things we know - that\u2019s K, and the W is for things we wanna know so that\u2019s our questions, and L is for the stuff we learned when we get answers for our questions,\u201d he replied around a mouthful of fruit.</p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full. But that\u2019s very interesting,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cTell me something you\u2019ve learned, then. That part on this chart Mr. Watson put on the back is blank.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause we\u2019re still doing that part. It\u2019s not done yet.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right. What have you learned?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI learned that Katie gots two daddies,\u201d Henry said offhandedly, very focused on finishing his apple as he eyed a pile of books across the room.</p>\n<p> \u201cShe <i>has</i> two daddies,\u201d Sherlock corrected. \u201cIs one a stepdad?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cNah. She just has two daddies and no mommies. She said she doesn\u2019t need any mommies \u2018cause her daddies love her more than a hundred mommies.\u201d Henry scrunched up his face in a puzzled expression for a moment, as if he were still trying to figure that one out. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s okay that I don\u2019t got a mommy \u2018cause she doesn\u2019t either. But she gots - <i>has</i> two daddies, so am I gonna get another daddy?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock felt a pang of guilt at his son\u2019s innocent question. He tried his best to be enough for Henry - and perhaps he was - but Henry seemed to be fixated on a two-parent household as the norm. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt, ah, doesn\u2019t quite work like that,\u201d Sherlock explained. \u201cKatie has two daddies because they both prefer men. The majority of couples will be one man and one women, but that\u2019s not always the case. Some couples are two women, and some are two men.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry gave him a blank look, and Sherlock realized he needed to explain in a more Kindergarten-friendly manner. \u201cAh...well, I suppose it just depends on whom you love. If a man loves a man and they have a baby, there are two daddies. If a woman loves a woman and they have a baby, there are two mommies. If a man loves a woman, there is one mommy and one daddy.\u201d</p>\n<p> Comprehension dawned on Henry\u2019s face. \u201cSo anybody can love anybody,\u201d he summed up. </p>\n<p> \u201cIn simple terms, yes,\u201d Sherlock replied. </p>\n<p> Henry gave him a look with those serious grey eyes that Sherlock knew meant he was about to have to answer a difficult question. \u201cYou and mommy had me, but she isn\u2019t here. So do you love daddies instead?\u201d</p>\n<p> For a moment Sherlock considered calling up Mr. Watson and putting him on with Henry to answer all these questions, since they were his fault anyway. Not that John would be able to answer personal questions about Sherlock. Ah, the joys of parenting.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s...a bit more complicated than that,\u201d Sherlock began. He had never been one to sugar coat things for Henry or to tell him anything less than the truth, so he forged on. \u201cWhat matters to me is what kind of person they are, not necessarily if they are a man or a woman.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry nodded sagely, as if this was a simple issue to understand. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, finishing his apple. \u201cLet\u2019s read books now.\u201d<br>\nSherlock smiled and followed Henry to the sitting room, mildly relieved that he didn\u2019t have to offer up any more explanations at the moment. He was certain they were far from finished with the topic, though. Much like his father, once Henry became curious about something he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until he had all the answers.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> That night Sherlock laid in bed, staring at the ceiling in thought as sleep evaded him. Before Henry his sleep schedule had been highly erratic, but he realized he needed to normalize it somewhat when his nocturnal activities woke Henry. Now he kept to his room at night, though he made sure to have plenty of things to occupy himself as he needed less sleep than the average person.</p>\n<p> He couldn\u2019t help but feel he was letting Henry down by not actively seeking a partner, but then again Henry might not welcome the intrusion on their family. Sherlock found dating tedious and unpleasant, and he had no real desire to share his life with someone other than his son. The night that had resulted in Henry had been just that - one night. He had been relieved that Henry\u2019s mother wanted nothing to do with them rather than worried about how he was going to cope on his own. It had been a rough transition having a newborn baby in his home, but it was a challenge he had accepted readily and eagerly. Sherlock had done many impressive things in his life, but helping to create Henry had been by far the best. He smiled as he thought of his son currently sleeping in a tangled mess of Avengers sheets, clutching a well-loved stuffed rabbit in a death grip.</p>\n<p> Sherlock had known these questions were going to come up sooner or later, though he had been hoping for later. Tomorrow he would investigate the list of books John had provided in a hand-written note attached to Henry\u2019s newsletter, and perhaps a few of the websites as well. He had to admit to himself that he was intrigued by John. Henry hadn\u2019t responded so readily to anyone outside what he considered to be his immediate family, which included Sherlock, his brother Mycroft, the Lieutenant Sherlock worked with, and their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. What was it that made John an exception to the rule? Their brief meeting hadn\u2019t been enough. Sherlock was going to have to devise a way to meet with him again, though considering Henry\u2019s issues at school it shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem to set up another meeting to discuss them. Of course, before he went any further, he should probably simply ask Henry what made John different.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> The next morning Henry was happily munching on strawberry jam-covered toast, legs swinging off the high stool he was seated on. Unlike Sherlock, who was picky about his food, Henry would eat anything placed in front of him. Sherlock sipped at his tea and asked, \u201cWhy do you like Mr. Watson?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry thought for a moment, then took a drink of his juice. \u201c\u2018Cause he\u2019s nice. He doesn\u2019t get mad when I don\u2019t talk and he doesn\u2019t treat me like a baby like other people do. And he lets us play with Legos at free choice time. He even helped me make a pirate ship one time!\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock chuckled and finger-combed Henry\u2019s wild brown curls. \u201cWell then he must be a good teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYup,\u201d Henry confirmed as he shoved the rest of his toast in his mouth. \u201cOkay daddy let\u2019s go,\u201d he mumbled around his mouthful of toast.</p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full,\u201d Sherlock reminded him for the umpteenth time. \u201cWhy are you in such a rush today?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019re doin\u2019 a science \u2018speriment,\u201d he replied as he pulled on his shoes and stuck his feet out at Sherlock, who obligingly knelt down and tied them. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou need to start learning how to tie your shoes soon.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, Drew can tie his already, but he\u2019s the only one. I could be the other only one!\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock smiled. \u201cYou certainly could. All right, up you get. I want to hear all about your science experiment when I pick you up from school,\u201d he said as they walked down the stairs and out the door. </p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cI\u2019ll make some notes like you do.\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s \u2018notes\u2019 consisted of a few bullet-pointed words like he\u2019d seen Sherlock do, as well as a few lines of scribbles. To be fair, Sherlock had notoriously messy handwriting and to a five year old, it probably did look like scribbles. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell then, I look forward to them,\u201d Sherlock replied.</p>\n<p> The walk to school only took about ten minutes, and soon Henry was bounding up the steps and into the building. Sherlock waved goodbye, then set out at a brisk pace to the nearest bookstore, the note from John in his pocket. He had some research to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Watson! Henry\u2019s crying!\u201d</p>\n<p> John looked up from the pile of guided reading books he was trying to sort into their proper bins. He often got reports of kids crying, and it usually wasn\u2019t a big deal. It also usually wasn\u2019t Henry. Grabbing a tissue, he went over to Tiger table and crouched down next to Henry. He handed the tissue to Henry, who wiped it all over his face to dry the tears. </p>\n<p> \u201cCan anyone tell me what happened?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry\u2019s crying!\u201d blurted Mazie, a small girl with blonde pigtails.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, I know,\u201d John replied. \u201cCan anyone tell me <i>why</i> he\u2019s crying?\u201d</p>\n<p> Mazie pointed a chubby finger accusingly at the boy next to Henry. \u201cRobert was mean to him! He said his family\u2019s the best one \u2018cause he has a dad anna mom anna sister and Henry only gots a dad and <i>I</i> don\u2019t have a sister!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNu-uh!\u201d Robert yelled with a frown. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes you did!\u201d Mazie insisted.</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d John interrupted. \u201cRobert, do you remember our talks about families?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\u201d Robert mumbled, arms crossed over his chest.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd all families the same or different?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cDifferent,\u201d Robert replied sullenly.</p>\n<p> \u201cIs one kind of family better than another kind?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d said the boy, averting his gaze to his handwriting book.</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right then. You need to tell Henry and Mazie you\u2019re sorry for hurting their feelings.\u201d John looked at the other two children. Mazie was angry and self-righteous in her teacher\u2019s justification of her being correct, but Henry was quiet and withdrawn, absently looking out the window. </p>\n<p> \u201cSorry Mazie. Sorry Henry,\u201d Robert mumbled. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Mazie said begrudgingly. Then she continued working in her workbook, all troubles apparently forgotten. </p>\n<p> Henry was not so quick to recover. He was now staring at the floor, playing idly with his pencil. </p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, are you okay?\u201d John asked. Henry looked at John, eyes bright with tears, but made no move to answer.</p>\n<p> \u201cWould you like to come finish your work at the reading table?\u201d he asked. The reading table was a kidney-shaped table near John\u2019s desk where John met with reading groups, and if a child could not concentrate on their work at their table, felt uncomfortable, or were being a distraction to their tablemates, they often came and worked at the reading table. </p>\n<p> Henry nodded slightly and picked up his things, then wove his way through the tables and sat down at his new temporary spot. Looking over as John sat down at his desk, Henry gave him a tiny, watery smile then began practicing the letter I. </p>\n<p> John returned his smile, but he was worried. Robert was a very charismatic child and if other students began to follow his lead talking about \u2018real\u2019 families, that could mean trouble for many of the students in the class who did not come from traditional father-mother families. They would have to have another whole-group discussion this afternoon, and if the behavior continued it meant notes and phone calls home to parents. John knew Mazie would be fine, having already recovered from the incident and moved on, but he would probably need to call Henry\u2019s father after school. Again. Sighing, John picked up a stack of papers that needed correcting and hoped that Sherlock wouldn\u2019t think he was a horrendous teacher.</p>\n<p> Hearing the clank of a chair being clumsily pulled out in true Kindergarten fashion, John looked up to see that Grace had deposited her things next to Henry at the reading table. Grace\u2019s family was from China, and she was a fairly good English speaker but sometimes had trouble coming up words for things. She often wore pink and nearly always wore her hair in two pigtails that stuck out like little tufts from the sides of her head. She was very sweet but outspoken, and apparently she had made it her job to look after Henry. John had noticed that she had recently begun following Henry around and recess and made the same choices as him at Choice Time if there was room in the area Henry had chosen. John smiled to himself. Young girls often took on mothering qualities, especially if they had younger siblings. It seemed like this is what Grace had decided to do with Henry. Thankfully John hadn\u2019t noticed her being overbearing or babying Henry, and he hoped that they might become friends. Henry could certainly use one.</p>\n<p> John watched them as they worked. Henry, of course, said nothing, but he seemed content to work while Grace occasionally showed him a letter that she was particularly proud of. John even spotted him pointing to one of his own letters that he had clearly worked hard on, a very proper-looking T. She smiled and complimented him, and he smiled in return. John was pleased he could give Sherlock some good news along with the bad.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>As John dialed Sherlock\u2019s number, he wondered if this was one of the numbers he\u2019d end up memorizing this year. There were always one or two parents he had to call so often that he knew their numbers by heart by the end of the year. As he waited for Sherlock to pick up, he realized he was nervous, which was odd. There was nothing to be unsure of; he\u2019d spoken to Sherlock before and found him to be pleasant after the initial coldness had worn off. John realized with some confusion that his nervousness was born of excitement. He didn\u2019t have time to think any more on it, though, because there was an answer at the other end of the line.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello, John. Has Henry had more trouble at school?\u201d Sherlock asked expectantly.</p>\n<p> Right to the point. Okay. \u201cWell, I have a bit of good news and bad news this time,\u201d John replied. \u201cThere was a little incident today where a student at Henry\u2019s table was apparently telling Henry and another student that his family was better than theirs because he had a mom and a dad. I think I took care of it, but in light of Henry\u2019s recent upset about not having a mother I thought I\u2019d let you know. He was upset, but I had him move to the reading table to work, and here\u2019s the good news part. Another student named Grace came and sat with him and they seemed to get along. I think she\u2019s determined to be his friend,\u201d John said with a smile, even though he was on the phone.</p>\n<p> \u201cI see. Good news indeed,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cHe did mention playing outside with a friend, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me any more and...\u201d there was hesitation in his voice. \u201cWell, to be quite honest I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a real friend. Henry has a very active imagination and has come up with imaginary friends in the past. It\u2019s been over a year since he\u2019s mentioned them, but I thought perhaps he\u2019d started up again. It\u2019s good to know that the friend is real.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s quite normal for kids to have imaginary friends,\u201d John assured him. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad too. I think it\u2019ll be good for both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI think so as well. Was there anything else you needed to speak to me about?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> There wasn\u2019t, but John found himself wishing there was and almost made something up just so he could keep Sherlock on the line. He frowned at himself. That certainly was not very professional of him. \u201cAh, no, that was all,\u201d he said, affecting a cheerful tone. \u201cJust wanted to keep you up to date.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI do appreciate it. Thank you, John. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll speak soon.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSure, of course. Bye,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Over dinner that night, Sherlock asked, \u201cDid anything happen at school today?\u201d a bit too nonchalantly. </p>\n<p> Henry looked up suspiciously from the mashed potato volcano he was building. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock hesitated, then said, \u201cMr. Watson gave me a call. You\u2019re not in trouble, though.\u201d He didn\u2019t want Henry to be angry with John, but Sherlock wasn\u2019t going to lie to him either.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh okay,\u201d Henry replied, as if he had expected the answer. \u201cRobert told me and Mazie that his family was better even though Mr. Watson said all the families are different so no one\u2019s is better. So Mr. Watson told him he was wrong and I got to go sit at the reading table,\u201d he said, a note of triumph in his voice. \u201cMy friend came to sit with me too,\u201d he added, then shoved a carrot in his mouth and chomped in satisfaction. </p>\n<p> Sherlock nodded. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your friend\u2019s name?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cShe\u2019s Grace and she\u2019s from China,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cShe talks a whole lot and she doesn\u2019t care if I don\u2019t talk. And guess what!\u201d he said excitedly. \u201cShe was my partner for the \u2018speriment yesterday and we had a success! Mr. Watson said a success is when our guess matches what we found out,\u201d he said proudly, then shoveled mashed potatoes into his mouth.</p>\n<p> They really needed to work on his table manners, Sherlock thought tiredly. \u201cWell that\u2019s very exciting,\u201d he replied. \u201cDid you take any notes?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYep! Mr. Watson gave us special papers just for notes. And I drew some pictures too, just like you!\u201d Henry said, jumping out of his seat and running towards his backpack. He pulled out his folder and snatched a single sheet of paper from it, then ran back to the table and plopped into his seat, waving the paper at his dad. Sherlock took it and examined it. </p>\n<p> The worksheet began with a sentence that said \u201cI think lemon juice/soapy water will make my penny shiny.\u201d Henry had circled \u2018lemon juice.\u2019 Below that under the word \u2018Before,\u2019 Henry had drawn a picture of his penny in brown. Next to that under the word \u2018After\u2019 he had drawn a picture of his penny in an orange-yellow, presumably after he\u2019d washed it with lemon juice. At the bottom, there was a question that asked, \u201cWas I right?\u201d Henry had written \u201cYES!!!\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock smiled. \u201cVery nice work. How did you know the lemon juice would work?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry smiled proudly. \u201cCause one time when you left a bunch of money in the bathtub I played with it. It was real dirty but soap didn\u2019t make it clean, so I guessed lemon juice.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood idea. I think we\u2019ll put this up on the fridge. Where did that money go, by the way?\u201d Sherlock asked, knowing full well where it had gone.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, I dunno,\u201d Henry said with an air of innocence. \u201cMaybe down the drain,\u201d he offered, imagining his globe bank into which he had put the coins.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Sherlock agreed with a small smile as he got up and hung the paper on the fridge with a magnet shaped like the letter H. </p>\n<p> \u201cH for Henry!\u201d Henry declared as he picked up his plate. \u201cOkay dinner\u2019s all done, let\u2019s go play!\u201d</p>\n<p>John waved goodbye to the last student leaving at the end of the day, then began to go through returned permission slips. He needed to mark down which ones he\u2019d received as well as which parents were volunteering. It was mid-October now, and he marveled at how fast the first month or so of school had gone by. It was always like that; so much to do and not enough time to do it left him feeling like time was passing by faster than it should. </p>\n<p> They were going on a field trip to a farm with a pumpkin patch, where they would get to see animals, go on a hayride, and pick pumpkins. John took his classes on this field trip every year, and it was always a hit. He usually had lots of parent volunteers - more than he needed, but it was easy enough to accommodate lots of parents and John thought it was nice that they could share this experience with their kids.</p>\n<p> He had gotten most of the way through the pile of slips when he came across Henry\u2019s. Henry was going, and John was pleasantly surprised to see that Sherlock had checked the box next to \u201cYes, I am interested in being a chaperone.\u201d Sherlock hadn\u2019t really seemed like the type to enjoy a trip to the farm. Usually parents were too busy with their children to talk with John beyond a polite \u2018hello how are you doing,\u2019 but that didn\u2019t stop him from hoping he\u2019d get a chance to speak with Sherlock on the trip. He told himself they would, of course, be speaking about Henry to appease his sense of professional pride, but if he was being honest he knew he just wanted to get to know the man better. That was a little dangerous considering Sherlock\u2019s son was John\u2019s student and if John were to become overly friendly with Sherlock, he might be seen as favoring Henry. </p>\n<p> Then again, John was never one to shy away from danger.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John\u2019s class had been eagerly counting down the days to their field trip, and it had finally arrived. They could not have asked for more perfect weather. The sun was out, the air was cool and crisp, the sky was a vivid blue, and there was no sign of wind or rain. John felt a little like he had stepped into a movie as they arrived at the farm, but didn\u2019t have much time to appreciate it as he soon had his hands full of overly excited Kindergartners. </p>\n<p> Before he knew it, the field trip was nearly at an end and the kids were in a patch of small pumpkins, each looking for their idea of the perfect one. He smiled as he saw Grace waving Henry over excitedly to look at a pumpkin with an odd growth on its side, but he found he was a bit disappointed that he hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to talk to Sherlock. He realized with a sinking feeling that perhaps Sherlock simply wasn\u2019t interested in talking to him. Sherlock was intelligent, interesting, and unlike anyone John had ever met, and John was...well, he was a Kindergarten teacher. It was a fulfilling, respectable, and difficult career, but not everyone saw it that way. John still wasn\u2019t sure exactly what Sherlock did for a living beyond the title, but it was probably more exciting to talk about than his own career.</p>\n<p> He was startled out of his thoughts by a presence at his side followed quickly by a statement in a deep, sonorous voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day. This has been an enjoyable trip.\u201d</p>\n<p> John turned slightly so he could face Sherlock but still keep an eye on the kids, and he couldn\u2019t help the small smile that curved his lips. \u201cYeah, we got really lucky with the weather. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a good time. To be honest, I was a little surprised to see that you had volunteered to chaperone. No offense, but you don\u2019t really seem like the farm type,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> Sherlock smiled every so slightly. \u201cYou would be correct in your assumption. If I am to be honest as well, I wasn\u2019t sure I would enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh?\u201d John asked. \u201cThen why did you come? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, that is,\u201d he added hurriedly.</p>\n<p> A surprised look crossed Sherlock\u2019s face before it smoothed back into a cool, collected expression. \u201cWell, Henry said you really needed volunteers. And I rather suspect he thought it\u2019d be funny to see his dad walking amongst cows and seated on a bale of hay. He does tend to get nervous about new environments, so I imagine that played a factor as well.\u201d</p>\n<p> John chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s put one over on you. I always have more than enough parent volunteers for this trip. I just told the kids that if their moms or dads wanted to volunteer, they\u2019d be welcome to.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock laughed. \u201cIt seems he has. Well, I suppose I should thank him. I have had a nice time.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m glad. I think it\u2019s nice for parents to get a chance to interact with their kids while the kids are still together as a class. It gives the parents the opportunity to see what their child is like outside of home,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> Nodding, Sherlock said, \u201cIndeed. It has been...enlightening to observe how Henry interacts with his classmates. I do wish he would speak at school, but he does seem happy and I am grateful for that,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s still early on in the year. There\u2019s plenty of time for him to start speaking,\u201d John reassured him. \u201cHe\u2019s doing very well; he\u2019s an incredibly bright boy. I enjoy having him in my class,\u201d John said sincerely.</p>\n<p> \u201cI...thank you,\u201d Sherlock said. \u201cHis preschool teachers found him frustrating, so I must admit I didn\u2019t hold a lot of hope for this year. I\u2019m, ah, glad he was placed in a classroom with an understanding teacher such as yourself,\u201d Sherlock said as he kept his gaze trained on Henry out in the pumpkin patch.</p>\n<p> John was mortified to find that he was blushing slightly at the compliment. He was a grown man, for God\u2019s sake! \u201cThank you. I just do what I can, and thankfully it works out most of the time,\u201d he said, brushing the praise aside. Changing the subject, he said, \u201cHenry likes science a lot. You mentioned you did experiments at home. Do you two work on them together?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock nodded. \u201cIf it\u2019s safe enough, I allow Henry to assist me. He\u2019s very good at it,\u201d he added with a note of pride in his voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cI noticed. He seems to have a good grasp on the process when we do little experiments in class. He even managed to help the other kids at his table. He didn\u2019t talk, of course, but he arranged their materials in the order they were supposed to use them,\u201d John replied, pleased that he could inform Sherlock with good news.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe likes you a lot, you know,\u201d Sherlock said quietly. \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve impressed him.\u201d</p>\n<p> John wondered briefly if by \u2018him\u2019 Sherlock had meant \u2018us,\u2019 but he quickly dismissed the thought. Wishful and slightly inappropriate thinking. \u201cWell, that\u2019s always great to hear,\u201d he replied.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe talks about you all the time. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about so much of his attention going to someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p> John was about to apologize when he realized Sherlock was smiling.</p>\n<p> \u201cI am joking, of course,\u201d Sherlock chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m glad he has you to look up to. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t always fit that particular bill.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, none of us are perfect,\u201d John laughed. </p>\n<p> Without warning, Sherlock asked, \u201cWould you like to come over for dinner on Saturday?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cOh,\u201d John said in surprise. \u201cI, ah-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s just that Henry was asking,\u201d Sherlock interrupted, suddenly unsure of himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s unconventional or not, but -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes,\u201d John replied, interrupting in turn before he had time to actually think about possible ramifications. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p>\n<p> For a moment Sherlock appeared relieved, but he quickly composed himself. \u201cYes, all right. Henry will be thrilled.\u201d</p>\n<p> Before John could respond, Henry came running over carrying a small but perfectly round pumpkin. He grinned and held it out to Sherlock for inspection, who accepted it and looked it over.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve made an excellent choice. Shall we carve it when we get home?\u201d Sherlock asked with a smile.</p>\n<p> Henry beamed and nodded, then took his pumpkin back and dashed off to help Grace pick out hers.</p>\n<p> John chuckled. \u201cSounds like fun. Well, looks like it\u2019s about time to round everybody up and get them back to school. I\u2019ll see you Saturday?\u201d John asked, a hint of hesitation in his voice, unsure if perhaps Sherlock had changed his mind.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, of course. We look forward to it,\u201d Sherlock replied. John flashed him a smile and then headed toward the class, blowing his whistle for them to line up.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Sherlock and Henry were unable to carve the pumpkin that night or the following, as Sherlock had been called in on a case. Henry accepted the delay without a fuss, having grown used to that sort of thing over his few years. In fact, Sherlock sometimes wondered if he should be worried that his son didn\u2019t throw more fits like the majority of kids his age, but then again it would probably be best not to look a gift horse in the mouth. </p>\n<p> Five year olds tended to be very self-centered, which is not to say that they are always selfish. They simply haven\u2019t figured out yet that the world doesn\u2019t revolve entirely around them and their wants and needs. Henry seemed to be the exception to the rule, knowing that sometimes on short notice his dad had to things other than the activities they had planned. True, he had initially thrown fits, but when he learned they got him nowhere except perhaps timeouts in his room, he\u2019d stopped.</p>\n<p> Sherlock finished his email to Lestrade, the Lieutenant who called him in on cases, and closed his laptop with a feeling of relief. It was two a.m. Saturday morning, and he had been worried he would have to cancel dinner with John in order to work on the case. It had been mind-numbingly easy, and for once Sherlock was thankful. Ordinarily he abhorred boring, simple cases, but Henry would have been heartbroken if they had to cancel dinner with his teacher. He had talked nonstop about it ever since Sherlock told him John had accepted their offer and already had the meal planned out (after Sherlock had vetoed pizza, which was Henry\u2019s favorite food in the world). They would be having lasagna, and due to much pleading by Henry, blueberry pie for dessert. </p>\n<p> Turning off his light, Sherlock decided to get a few hours\u2019 sleep, knowing Henry would be up at the crack of dawn ready to carve his pumpkin and go shopping for dinner.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy!\u201d Sherlock was jolted awake by a rambunctious bounce on his bed. \u201cDaddy it\u2019s time to carve my punkin and go shopping for the \u2018gredients for dinner!\u201d Henry said as he bounced from one side of Sherlock\u2019s prone form to the other. </p>\n<p> Sherlock glanced over at his clock. The cool blue numbers read 6:07 a.m. As expected, Henry hadn\u2019t wasted any time. He grabbed Henry around the waist and pulled him down next to him while Henry erupted in a fit of giggles. \u201cHow about some breakfast first?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd what about your cartoons?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes widened. He had nearly forgotten that Saturday was more than \u2018Mr.-Watson-Comes-to-Dinner-Day.\u2019 Squirming out of Sherlock\u2019s grasp, he ran out to the living room and Sherlock soon heard the chatter of the TV. It sounded like Looney Toons, which Sherlock had been surprised to find was still being aired. Apparently classics really did never die. Stretching, he got slowly out of bed. Henry would be occupied with that long enough for Sherlock to take a shower before making breakfast.</p>\n<p> As he stepped under the hot spray, he mapped out his plan for the day as he usually did and found he was nervous. It frustrated him because there was no good reason for it. He was a confident person, and having Henry\u2019s teacher over for dinner shouldn\u2019t worry him. John had seemed happy to accept the offer, so it wasn\u2019t as if they were forcing him. Sherlock was a good cook, so no worries there either. John was easy to converse with. Sherlock was a grown man; he should not be nervous about this dinner.</p>\n<p> Maybe that was the problem, he thought as he lathered shampoo in his hair. He\u2019d be lying if he said he didn\u2019t find John attractive. His eyes were especially intriguing; Sherlock hadn\u2019t encountered that shade of ocean-blue before. John had a kind smile, and Sherlock suspected he was rather fit under the baggy clothing he seemed to prefer. As he rinsed his hair, he wondered what John might look like in a well-fitting suit. Or a t-shirt. Or maybe shirtless. Heat began to pool in his lower abdomen, and with a slight start of horror Sherlock realized what he was doing and turned the water to cold, then off. It was entirely inappropriate for him to be fantasizing about his son\u2019s teacher. Especially in the shower. He was unused to being attracted to anyone, and it was thoroughly distracting. Sherlock sighed as he toweled himself dry. He had to figure out a way to reign it in before tonight.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> After breakfast, Sherlock and Henry were seated at the newspaper-covered table with the pumpkin in front of them. Sherlock had cut it open, and Henry was now gleefully scooping out its innards with his hands. He had absolutely no aversion to touching the slimy, stringy goop and Sherlock was oddly proud of it. </p>\n<p> Henry brought one of his hands to his nose and sniffed it, wrinkling his nose. \u201cDoesn\u2019t smell good. Can we eat it?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock chuckled. \u201cNot that part, but the shell can be cooked to make pumpkin pie and other sorts of pumpkin things. The seeds can also be baked in the oven.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cCan we do that?\u201d he asked excitedly, already sifting through the goop to pick out the seeds. </p>\n<p> \u201cSure,\u201d Sherlock replied, helping him separate the seeds. </p>\n<p> \u201cWe can give some to Mr. Watson when he comes over!\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cI suppose we could. We\u2019ll put them out in a little bowl, how about that?\u201d Sherlock answered, feeling a twinge of excitement when John\u2019s name was mentioned. He suppressed it immediately. These feelings were not something he could allow.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Daddy?\u201d Henry asked, looking concerned.</p>\n<p> Sherlock realized he must have been making a serious face and smiled. \u201cNothing. Just trying to remember what temperature the oven needs to be.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh okay. I\u2019m excited for Mr. Watson to come over. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d Henry asked, having reverted back to scooping out the pumpkin\u2019s guts, leaving Sherlock the more tedious task of picking out the seeds.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Sherlock replied, knowing that it was all too true.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Hours later after the pumpkin had been carved and Henry had taken a reluctant bath thanks to getting pumpkin innards all over himself, they were on their way to the grocery store. Henry was nearly vibrating with excitement as he felt he was in charge of the whole thing and therefore feeling rather grown up. Sherlock was making nearly everything from scratch, which meant they were a long time in the produce section. </p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, would you go pick out six tomatoes for me?\u201d Sherlock asked as he looked over the herb selection. \u201cMake sure they\u2019re good ones,\u201d he added, though it probably wasn\u2019t necessary. Henry had an uncanny ability for picking out ripe produce.</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and took his bag over to the large display of tomatoes. While he was looking them over, he stepped back to get a better overall view and bumped into a woman behind him. The movement caused her to drop the bag of apples she was carrying, and they spilled and rolled across the floor. She rounded on Henry with a glare.</p>\n<p> \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done!\u201d she exclaimed, motioning to the apples. \u201cThey\u2019re bound to be bruised now, and the store will probably make me pay for them!\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes widened and he stepped back. He knew he should apologize, he <i>wanted</i> to apologize, but the words wouldn\u2019t come. They never did. His throat felt tight as the woman continued to berate him.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou should apologize, young man,\u201d she insisted. \u201cLook at the trouble you\u2019ve caused!\u201d She stared expectantly at him. When he didn\u2019t reply, she prompted, \u201cWell? I\u2019m waiting!\u201d</p>\n<p> Tears stung Henry\u2019s eyes, then rolled onto his cheeks. He wished the tomato stand would open up and swallow him so he could hide away from the angry, terrifying woman. His lips were pressed in a firm line, as if they were making extra sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh for god\u2019s sake, you don\u2019t need to cry about it,\u201d she said in an exasperated tone. \u201cJust apologize!\u201d</p>\n<p> At that moment Sherlock came storming up, and Henry ran to bury his face in his dad\u2019s coat. Sherlock\u2019s expression was dark. \u201cWhat kind of person yells at a child to apologize for what was clearly an accident?\u201d he hissed. \u201cAnd one that was most likely your fault, since you can\u2019t seem to tear yourself away from your phone for two seconds. What is it, texting a lover?\u201d he sneered. \u201cOh, you\u2019re husband\u2019s found out, hasn\u2019t he? You\u2019re trying to salvage the marriage. Don\u2019t bother,\u201d he said savagely.</p>\n<p> The woman stared at him in stunned silence, then turned and hurried away, leaving the apples forgotten on the floor. Sherlock glared daggers at her back, then knelt down next to Henry. He tried not to make deductions like that around his son, but he had been so angry he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cHenry, are you okay?\u201d he asked gently, wrapping his arms around him.</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and sniffed in reply.</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you still want to finish the shopping, or should we go home?\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry wiped his face on his sleeve and took a deep breath. \u201cFinish,\u201d he replied softly, so quiet Sherlock could barely hear. </p>\n<p> \u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry I left you alone,\u201d Sherlock said, guilt written all over his face.</p>\n<p> Henry wrapped his arms around his dad\u2019s neck and hugged him in reply, then picked up his bag and began filling it with plump, red tomatoes. Sherlock watched him, worried. This wasn\u2019t the first time something like this had happened. When it did, Henry usually spent the rest of the day in sad silence, sometimes shutting himself in his room. </p>\n<p> Sherlock could only hope that the prospect of John coming to dinner would ward it off.</p>\n<p>John stood in front of his dresser dressed only in a towel, debating what to wear to dinner. He didn\u2019t want to come across as too casual, but he didn\u2019t want to be overdressed either. Pulling out a shirt, he inspected it, then sighed and put it back in the drawer. Too plain. He grabbed a burgundy sweater and pulled it on, then took it off five seconds later. Too uncomfortable. He was beginning to feel like Goldilocks when he spotted a shirt with thick black and white stripes. It was one of his favorites, and as he put it on it felt like the right choice. It was perhaps a little on the \u2018too plain\u2019 side, but John decided being slightly underdressed would be better than being overdressed. He didn\u2019t want to look like he was trying to hard. There might not even be anything to try for. And he still had the lingering uneasy feeling that this was not something he should be doing.</p>\n<p> Shaking his head, he quickly pulled on boxers, dark jeans, and socks and went to the bathroom to fix his hair. Normally he wouldn\u2019t fuss about it too much but...well, all reservations aside, he wanted to make a good impression. When he stepped out of the bathroom, he was gripped by a slight panic when he realized he hadn\u2019t gotten anything to bring to dinner. Should he have? The customary gift was a bottle of wine, but that wasn\u2019t appropriate for dinner with a child and might send the wrong signals. Not to mention he didn\u2019t know what they were having, so he wouldn\u2019t know whether to get red or white. No, he decided, he didn\u2019t have to bring anything. This was just a casual dinner with a student and his father. It would be fine.</p>\n<p> Before he had the chance to worry himself out of going, John grabbed his jacket and headed out the door. It wasn\u2019t long before he stood outside a small but nice-looking building, a shiny gold \u2018221\u2019 on the door notifying him that he had arrived at the correct address. He knocked on the door with three sharp raps of his knuckles, wondering who would answer since the slip of paper Sherlock had sent in Henry\u2019s folder said 221B. Hearing footsteps on the other side of the door, John\u2019s stomach twisted in an anxious knot. When a spry-looking elderly woman answered the door, he relaxed. </p>\n<p> \u201cUm, hello. I\u2019m looking for apartment 221B,\u201d John began.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, you must be John! Come in, come in, the boys are waiting,\u201d the woman replied with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Hudson, I\u2019m the landlady of this building.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh, nice to meet you,\u201d John replied, stepping into the building and following her up the stairs. \u201cDo you live here as well?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI live in 221A,\u201d she replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a third unit, 221C, but it needs renovation and I just haven\u2019t gotten around to it. Sherlock and Henry are lovely tenants,\u201d she chattered on, making her way slowly up the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see Sherlock having a date over,\u201d she cooed. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, um, I\u2019m not his date. It\u2019s not a date\u201d John corrected, red-faced. \u201cI\u2019m Henry\u2019s teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course, right you are,\u201d Mrs. Hudson said with a wink. John had no chance to reply because she shouted up the stairs, \u201cYoo-hoo boys, you\u2019ve got a visitor!\u201d</p>\n<p> When they reached the top of the stairs, John spotted Henry standing in the open doorway with a smile on his face before he darted back into the apartment. Soon he returned with the tall figure of Sherlock at his side, who was wearing an apron that looked like it might have been a present from Henry at some point. It was black (practical for hiding stains, John thought) with a large yellow smiley face painted on the chest area. </p>\n<p> \u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock said with a smile. \u201cPlease, come in. Dinner\u2019s just about ready,\u201d he said as he stepped aside so John could enter the apartment. \u201cThank you Mrs. Hudson. Perhaps you\u2019ll come up for dessert later?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThank you dear, but I wouldn\u2019t want to interrupt,\u201d she said with another wink, this one aimed at Sherlock. \u201cHave fun, boys!\u201d she added as she headed back downstairs. </p>\n<p> Sherlock\u2019s cheeks were tinged pink, but that was the only sign that the wink had flustered him. Shutting the door behind John, he motioned for John to follow him to the kitchen.</p>\n<p> \u201cIs there anything I can help with?\u201d John asked as he shrugged out of his jacket and set it on a stool. \u201cSmells delicious, whatever it is.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLasagna,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cHenry picked it out. I hope that\u2019s all right?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, more than. I love it,\u201d John replied with a reassuring smile. </p>\n<p> Glancing around the kitchen to make sure it was empty but for the two of them, Sherlock stepped closer to John and said in a low voice, \u201cWe had a bit of an incident at the grocery store today. A woman shouted at Henry for not speaking to her. This isn\u2019t the first time something like that\u2019s happened, and when it has Henry has generally kept to himself in his room for the remainder of the day. He seems to be doing a bit better this time, thanks to your visit I think. But if he seems distant, that\u2019s why,\u201d Sherlock said, worry creasing his brow.</p>\n<p> John\u2019s expression mimicked Sherlock\u2019s. \u201cGod, that\u2019s awful. I\u2019m so sorry that happened. That\u2019s just inexcusable,\u201d he said, feeling angry on Henry\u2019s behalf</p>\n<p> \u201cI...might have yelled at her a little,\u201d Sherlock said, ducking his head in embarrassment. </p>\n<p> John chuckled. \u201cI would have too.\u201d</p>\n<p> Just then, Henry entered the kitchen carefully holding a paper near his chest with the blank side facing out, as if to hide what was on the other side. He stood near his dad, but his eyes were on John.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello, Henry,\u201d John said with a warm smile. \u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry smiled shyly and handed John the paper. It was a drawing of two people (John assumed they were Henry and himself) standing side-by-side outdoors. There was a sun and some birds in the sky, and a carefully drawn rabbit at their feet. Everything in the picture save the sun was smiling, and Henry was holding a black stick with a circle attached to the end - a magnifying glass, perhaps.</p>\n<p> \u201cThis is great, Henry! I love all your details. I\u2019ll hang it up on my fridge when I go home. Thank you!\u201d John responded.</p>\n<p> Henry beamed with pride, and all shyness forgotten came to stand at John\u2019s side. He pointed to the rabbit, then tapped John\u2019s hands. John glanced quickly at Sherlock to see if he\u2019d get any explanation, but Sherlock was simply watching so he looked back at Henry. Holding his hands out, he asked, \u201cIs this a rabbit you know, or is it a rabbit you made up just for the picture?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry tapped John\u2019s right hand, signifying that it was a rabbit he knew. He seemed pleased but expectant, so John continued. \u201cIs he your rabbit or someone else\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p> Again, Henry tapped John\u2019s right hand for the first answer option. John hadn\u2019t noticed a cage or any sign of a rabbit in the house, so after a bit of quick thinking he asked, \u201cIs it a real rabbit or an imaginary one?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry tapped John\u2019s left hand and shot his dad a look, at which point Sherlock interrupted the \u2018conversation.\u2019 \u201cI won\u2019t let him have a real pet yet, so he\u2019s made up a pretend one. He calls it Bluebell because I\u2019ve been reading a book called Watership Down to him and that\u2019s the name of one of the characters,\u201d Sherlock explained.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, I know that book. Haven\u2019t read it in years, though. My mom used to read it to me when I was a kid,\u201d John replied. \u201cI always liked that one character with the extra fur on his head the best.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry perked up, looking like he wanted to say something, but didn\u2019t. \u201cBigwig,\u201d Sherlock supplied.</p>\n<p> \u201cRight, yeah,\u201d John said as the faded memories came back to him. \u201cAnd, uh, that seagull. Kehaar?\u201d he ventured a guess.</p>\n<p> Henry grinned and nodded. Thankfully the oven timer beeped and John was saved from trying discuss the book further. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to, but he was rather rusty on the subject and didn\u2019t know how much more he could really contribute to the conversation.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, will you set the table?\u201d Sherlock asked as he removed the bread from the oven. Henry nodded and began working, setting each item on the table with the utmost care and precision, as though he wanted everything to be perfect. Which, John suspected, he probably did. </p>\n<p> Soon they were all seated around the small square table eating dinner with Sherlock in the middle and Henry and John facing each other. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d John commented. \u201cYou made it all yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Sherlock replied, feeling a warm glow settle in his chest.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhere did you learn to cook like this?\u201d John asked after taking a sip of his wine. Apparently it would have been fine to bring wine. John would have to bring a bottle next time. If there was a next time. Should there be a next time? John put the thought from his mind for now, intent on enjoying the moment.</p>\n<p> Sherlock shrugged. \u201cCooking is simply science; it wasn\u2019t difficult to understand the process.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s got to be more than that,\u201d John laughed. \u201cI can follow directions, but usually things I make never turn out quite right. I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s some sort of natural talent.\u201d </p>\n<p> A wide grin spread across Henry\u2019s face, and John looked at him questioningly. Sherlock sighed and said, \u201cHe probably wants me to tell you about the time I exploded a cake in the oven.\u201d Henry nodded emphatically.</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right, then. I suppose you get to be one of three people who know about my culinary failures,\u201d Sherlock said. It was a joke, but John couldn\u2019t help feeling special somehow. Maybe it was time to lay off the wine.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m still not sure what happened, actually. I must have substituted one ingredient for another. It was a complex recipe, and any deviation seems to have rather...messy consequences,\u201d Sherlock explained, somewhat embarrassed.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, it happens to the best of us,\u201d John replied, wanting to ease Sherlock\u2019s discomfort.</p>\n<p> \u201cIndeed. What Henry neglected to mention as he gleefully told Mrs. Hudson and my brother about the failure was that I tried again and the cake came out just fine,\u201d Sherlock stated.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell of course he didn\u2019t tell that part. That\u2019s not the funny part, right?\u201d John asked, to which Henry smiled and nodded.</p>\n<p> \u201cHm. I think I\u2019d better watch out so you two don\u2019t team up on me,\u201d Sherlock said mock-seriously, and John laughed.</p>\n<p> At the beginning of his visit, John had felt tense and a little awkward. As the meal progressed, though, conversation came naturally and he relaxed. John spent so much time at school that he\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like to simply talk with another adult about something other than assessments or how to make a science unit less boring. He found Sherlock to be engaging and exciting to listen to, especially when he talked about his cases. It was obvious he had a passion for what he did. It was obvious, too, that Henry was the center of his world, which John thought was very sweet and as it should be.</p>\n<p> When they moved on to dessert, John was secretly very excited. Blueberry pie was his favorite kind of pie, but he couldn\u2019t make it to save his life. \u201cThis is amazing. It\u2019s perfect, actually. You are some sort of cooking genius,\u201d John declared.</p>\n<p> At this, Henry sat up straight and held out his hands, which had recently been stained blue. \u201cI think Henry would like you to know that he helped out with the pie,\u201d Sherlock said. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell that must be why it\u2019s so delicious, then. Excellent job, Henry!\u201d John congratulated him. Henry took a moment to smile proudly, then continued shoveling pie and ice cream into his mouth. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d Sherlock asked, continuing their pre-pie conversation. \u201cAny hobbies?\u201d</p>\n<p> John gave a short laugh. \u201cWell, to be honest I spend most of my time doing work-related stuff. I run the Lego club at school, if you could call that a hobby. Henry\u2019s welcome to join it, by the way,\u201d he added. \u201cHe likes to play with the Legos during choice time, so I thought he might be interested.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWould you like to join, Henry?\u201d Sherlock asked, and Henry nodded eagerly in reply.</p>\n<p> \u201cGreat,\u201d John smiled. \u201cWe meet after school in my room on Tuesdays. As for other hobbies, I like to read so I like going to bookstores. I like to go for walks. God,\u201d he laughed, shaking his head. \u201cI sound like an elderly retired person. I don\u2019t really have much of a social life since...since I came back from the war,\u201d he said, accidentally breaching a topic he hadn\u2019t meant to bring up at all. \u201cAnd making friends outside of work at my age isn\u2019t exactly easy,\u201d he said with a laugh, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cBut, like I said, work keeps me busy enough that I wouldn\u2019t have much time to socialize anyway.\u201d </p>\n<p> Sherlock gave him a calculating look, but merely nodded and hummed in agreement.</p>\n<p> After they finished dessert, John offered to help clean up and was grateful when Sherlock accepted. John hated sitting around while things were done for him. They stood side-by-side at the sink, John washing and Sherlock drying. Each time their hands or arms accidentally brushed, John felt a small thrill of excitement that made him feel a bit like a teenager, and he wondered if Sherlock felt it, too. </p>\n<p> Henry had disappeared while they were washing up, and Sherlock worried that perhaps the incident at the store had been too much and he\u2019d retreated to his room. With impeccable timing, Henry reappeared just as there were no more chores to be done holding <i>Watership Down</i>. Handing it to John, Henry looked at him questioningly. </p>\n<p> \u201cI could probably read for a little bit, if that\u2019s all right?\u201d John asked, looking at Sherlock. </p>\n<p> \u201cOf course. It would be nice to hear someone reading it besides myself for a change,\u201d Sherlock replied.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure your reading is much better than mine. You have a lovely voice,\u201d John said without thinking. He felt his cheeks heat up when he realized he\u2019d given Sherlock what could be taken as a rather personal compliment.</p>\n<p> \u201cAh. Thank you,\u201d Sherlock replied, surprised and pleased. \u201cIt will be nice to have a break, then,\u201d he amended.</p>\n<p> John smiled in relief and sat down next to Henry, who was waiting impatiently on the couch. He ended up reading an entire chapter before Henry was satisfied, though he didn\u2019t mind because he found he didn\u2019t want to go. Suddenly the thought of his empty apartment seemed lonely and unappealing, but he didn\u2019t want to overstay his welcome. </p>\n<p> All three of them went to the door as John put on his jacket and got ready to leave. \u201cThank you for having me over,\u201d John said. \u201cI had a really great time.\u201d He hesitated, then said, \u201cIt was nice getting to know you better, Sherlock. You\u2019ll have to tell me more about your cases sometime. I mean, if you want to,\u201d he added quickly. Then, before he could become embarrassed, he said to Henry, \u201cAnd thank you for the awesome picture. I\u2019ll see you on Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt would be my pleasure,\u201d Sherlock replied as Henry waved goodbye. \u201cGoodnight, John.\u201d</p>\n<p> John headed out the door and down the stairs, and it wasn\u2019t long before they heard the sound of the front door closing. Feeling a tug on his pants, Sherlock looked down at his son, suddenly worried. Henry wore a very serious expression. Perhaps the evening hadn\u2019t gone as well as Sherlock had thought. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy,\u201d Henry said in a scandalized tone, \u201cyou can\u2019t call him <i>John</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock laughed and herded Henry back into their home, then shut the door.</p>\n<p>The sound of footsteps on the stairs accompanied by a distinct tap on each stair resulted in two very different reactions inside 221B. Sherlock was in the middle of an experiment testing the effects of different brands of bleach on various items, which meant Henry was, too. The boy was wearing a stained white lab coat with the sleeves rolled up since it was a bit big for him. He also had on rubber gloves and clear plastic goggles, and he wore them all proudly, feeling every inch the scientist. Their current experiment wasn\u2019t really dangerous enough to require such extreme safety measures, but Sherlock insisted upon Henry\u2019s safety gear and Henry liked it anyway. </p>\n<p> When the pair heard the tell-tale noise on the stairs, Sherlock sighed and continued the experiment. Henry, however, lit up, pulled off his gloves, and made a dash for the door. He opened it just as their visitor arrived. </p>\n<p> \u201cUncle Mycroft!\u201d he exclaimed gleefully, throwing his arms around his uncle\u2019s waist. Panic flashed across Mycroft\u2019s features as he wondered what sort of chemicals were on Henry\u2019s lab coat and what they might do to his suit, but before he could worry overly much about it Henry had detached and grabbed him by the hand. No harm had been done. Mycroft had been visiting Henry for five years now, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever get used to the spontaneity and overexcitement of children. </p>\n<p> \u201cCome look at our \u2018speriment,\u201d Henry insisted, dragging him along to the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at bleach on stuff. Daddy has to find out what kind of bleach the bad guy used so he can catch him!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSo Lieutenant Lestrade can catch him,\u201d Sherlock corrected as he compared two small pieces of denim with similar-looking bleach stains. </p>\n<p> Henry appeared a bit put out that anyone, even his own father, would dare suggest that his dad wasn\u2019t the one out catching bad guys. \u201cYeah, but you help. You figure the tricky stuff out. Isn\u2019t this cool Uncle Mycroft?\u201d</p>\n<p> Mycroft, of course, had always felt that Sherlock could be doing something much more worthwhile with his intelligence, but didn\u2019t want to upset Henry by saying so. \u201cYes, very cool indeed,\u201d he said in a manner that made clear he generally did not use the word \u2018cool\u2019 unless describing the temperature. \u201cI heard you had a visitor recently,\u201d he said, the statement directed at Henry since he\u2019d be more likely to get an answer out of the boy.</p>\n<p> Sherlock snorted. Mycroft mentioned it ever so casually, as if he had heard the information in passing instead of very purposefully gathering the information via surveillance. \u201cWe simply had Henry\u2019s -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMr. Watson came over for dinner!\u201d Henry interrupted excitedly. \u201cAnd I got to pick out dinner and I even helped make it and he really liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMm, did he now?\u201d Mycroft asked, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah!\u201d Henry nodded enthusiastically. He scooted closer to Mycroft and said conspiratorially, \u201cAnd guess what. Daddy likes him. He didn\u2019t even make any deductions at him,\u201d he added, eyes wide and serious.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell that <i>is</i> interesting,\u201d Mycroft replied with a smirk. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s called being polite,\u201d Sherlock interrupted with a frown. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be Henry\u2019s teacher for the rest of the year, and I didn\u2019t want to get off on the wrong foot.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course, of course. And we know you always have the <i>utmost</i> concern for manners,\u201d Mycroft said dryly. </p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, Daddy teaches me manners,\u201d Henry agreed, completely missing the sarcasm. Sherlock simply smirked at Mycroft while his son wasn\u2019t looking.</p>\n<p> Ignoring Sherlock, Mycroft said, \u201cSo tell me about Mr. Watson. Is he a good teacher?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Henry replied as he mimicked his father, peering closely at the things they had bleached. \u201cHe\u2019s real nice and lets us do \u2018speriments at school, too.\u201d He pointed to the fridge where his penny experiment paper was hanging. \u201cThat\u2019s mine from our penny \u2018speriment. I had a success!\u201d he made sure to point out proudly. \u201cAnd when Mr. Watson came to dinner he was still real nice even though we weren\u2019t even at school. And guess what else,\u201d he added, not pausing long enough for Mycroft to actually guess. \u201cHe actually listened to all Daddy\u2019s stories <i>and</i> he said he wanted to hear more!\u201d Henry divulged, certain that this was a very interesting fact.</p>\n<p> Mycroft agreed. \u201cWell, that is certainly good to hear,\u201d he said, shooting a glance at Sherlock, whose smile vanished from his face when he realized Mycroft was watching.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd he readed me Watership Down!\u201d Henry exclaimed, having saved what was in his mind the most important detail of all for last. \u201cUncle Mycroft can I have a bunny for Christmas?\u201d he pleaded. It was rare that Henry didn\u2019t ask for a bunny when Mycroft visited. After all, Mycroft often did bring him little presents on visits, and got him especially nice presents at Christmas. It stood to reason that if his father wouldn\u2019t get him a bunny, Uncle Mycroft might.</p>\n<p> Mycroft gave him the same answer as always. \u201cThat\u2019s up to your father, Henry. I\u2019ll read to you if you like. Why don\u2019t you go get your book?\u201d</p>\n<p> Never one to pass up the opportunity to have someone read to him, Henry was off to his room like a shot, leaving the adults to converse privately. </p>\n<p> \u201cWill the day ever arrive when you mind your own business?\u201d Sherlock asked testily as he carefully poured bleach into a test tube.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m merely looking after you, dearest brother. Mummy wouldn\u2019t like to find out that you\u2019re all on your own, not to mention on your own with a child, now would she?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock scowled. That bit of blackmail was getting old, but it remained effective. Sherlock had little desire to associate with his mother, and if she knew his situation a visit and a proper scolding as well as intense meddling would be imminent. And that was unacceptable.</p>\n<p> \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being interested in someone,\u201d Mycroft said, his voice gentler than before. For most of his adult life, Mycroft had stood by his beliefs that sentiment was a weakness. Since Henry\u2019s arrival he\u2019d had to amend those beliefs as he saw how caring for Henry had made Sherlock a better person. </p>\n<p> \u201cI know there\u2019s not,\u201d Sherlock snapped. \u201cBut he\u2019s Henry's teacher. It would most likely be inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p> A knowing smile spread across Mycroft\u2019s face, and Sherlock rolled his eyes when he realized what he\u2019d given away. \u201cBut you enjoyed his company?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes,\u201d Sherlock admitted begrudgingly. \u201cHe\u2019s...puzzling.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d Mycroft hummed noncommittally.</p>\n<p> Henry arrived back in the kitchen, waving his book in the air triumphantly. \u201cFound it!\u201d </p>\n<p> Mycroft allowed himself to be led to the sitting room, where he sat next to Henry (still in full experiment gear, just in case) and began to read. After a page or two, Henry insisted, \u201cYou have to do the voices!\u201d So Mycroft made an attempt at varying his voice for different characters, which made Sherlock grin at the notes he was taking. </p>\n<p> They hadn\u2019t gotten very far when heavy footsteps sounded in the stairwell. \u201cHey Sherlock, have you gotten anywhere with the -\u201d He stopped in surprise when he realized he wasn\u2019t the only visitor. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019t realize I was interrupting.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNot a problem,\u201d Sherlock replied smoothly. \u201cMycroft was just reading to Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThe American government, doing his part by reading to the kids, eh?\u201d Lestrade joked, a warm smile on his face.</p>\n<p> Mycroft returned the smile, tight-lipped though it was. \u201cI actually need to be going,\u201d he said as he stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll read more next time, Henry,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe might be finished by \u2018next time,\u2019\u201d Greg interjected with a laugh. \u201cThat kid devours books.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThat he does. Perhaps I\u2019ll bring him a new one.\u201d</p>\n<p> At this, Henry perked up. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIf you continue to do well in school, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Mycroft smiled. </p>\n<p> \u201cCan you bring me one about how to take care of bunnies so daddy will let me have one?\u201d Henry asked hopefully.</p>\n<p> Mycroft\u2019s smile grew wider as the corners of Sherlock\u2019s mouth turned down. \u201cI would be delighted to. But for now I must be off,\u201d he said, gathering up his umbrella.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt was nice seeing you,\u201d Lestrade said, a little too quickly.</p>\n<p> Mycroft paused, then nodded. \u201cAnd you as well. Good day, Lieutenant.\u201d </p>\n<p> When Mycroft had left the building, Lestrade turned to Sherlock. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he just call me Greg? Or Lestrade, even? I\u2019ve known him for years for God\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, a slight edge of frustration to his voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s a way of distancing himself from people,\u201d Sherlock murmured absently as he jotted down a few more notes. \u201cIf he fears he might become attached, he\u2019ll revert to titles rather than names. Of course, he refers to most everyone by title because it makes him sound important. However, as you said, he has known you for years. I\u2019ll leave you to your deductions on that.\u201d</p>\n<p> Greg\u2019s face was an amusing mixture of hope and disappointment. \u201cErm. Right, then. So about the thief, have you found anything out?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c\u2018Course he found anything out,\u201d Henry snorted. \u201cYou can go arrest the bad guy now. Tell him the bad guy, Daddy,\u201d Henry prompted. This was his favorite part.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe stains on the gloves at the crime scene match a brand of bleach sold only at the store where Hector Ramirez works. I imagine you\u2019ll find the missing money at his flat,\u201d Sherlock replied, then smiled at Henry who was grinning proudly, as if he was the one who had done all the work.</p>\n<p> Lestrade nodded. \u201cRight, thanks. I\u2019ll text you if we need anything more.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019ll be fairly open-and-shut from here on out. He seemed like the nervous type; I doubt you\u2019ll have trouble getting a confession,\u201d Sherlock said as he began to clean up the experiment. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder he ever got this far.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYep, open-and-shut,\u201d Henry parroted with his arms crossed over his chest, thinking it made him appear very official and grown-up.</p>\n<p> \u201cThanks, Henry,\u201d Lestrade grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you boys later!\u201d</p>\n<p> After he left, Henry began to shed his experiment equipment. \u201cGood thing you\u2019re so smart, Daddy,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise Mr. Lestrade wouldn\u2019t catch <i>anybody</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood thing I have a smart helper,\u201d Sherlock replied, mussing Henry\u2019s chestnut brown curls. \u201cAnd Mr. Lestrade is smart as well; he catches many criminals on his own. He only comes to me for the very difficult cases,\u201d he corrected.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, well, good thing we\u2019re all smart, then,\u201d Henry amended.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, good thing,\u201d Sherlock agreed.</p>\n<p>The dinner with Sherlock and Henry left John in a good mood for the entire following week, though he still wasn\u2019t entirely without reservations. There was no denying now that he was attracted to Sherlock, but he still wondered about the moral implications of it. John knew he wasn\u2019t favoring Henry above the other kids, but other parents and staff might not see it that way. It was a frustrating situation.</p>\n<p> When he realized he\u2019d been staring blankly at the unfinished lesson plan on his computer screen for the past ten minutes, he decided to get up and go for a walk. Maybe the fresh air would clear his head and then he could get his work finished. He occasionally envied people with nine-to-five jobs who could leave their work at work, but he loved what he did so the extra effort was always worth it. </p>\n<p> He buttoned up his coat and after a moment\u2019s hesitation grabbed his scarf as well. It was getting colder, a sign that winter was definitely on its way. John had never minded the winter until he went to war. Now that he was back, winter seemed colder and longer than he had remembered, which was why he had a large supply of bulky sweaters to keep warm. Sometimes other staff teased him good-naturedly about them, but he never minded. </p>\n<p> It wasn\u2019t yet Halloween, but plenty of shops were decorated for the holiday. John loved Halloween at school; it was a very busy day, but it was fun to see the excited students in their costumes. Last year there had been five Iron Mans in his class, and he was curious what the popular costume this year would be. John did make an effort to keep up with what was popular with the kids since they always wanted to talk about it, but sometimes things slipped by him. It seemed like Iron Man\u2019s popularity hadn\u2019t waned in the least, so he expected he\u2019d have at least a few of them, and undoubtedly several Disney princess as well. </p>\n<p> Before he realized it, John was at the park. He didn\u2019t recall ever making the decision to go there, but since it was generally where he headed when he went on walks, he wasn\u2019t too surprised. Meandering over to a bench near the fountain, John sat down and absently observed the other people in the park. There weren\u2019t too many there thanks to the chilly weather, so it was fairly peaceful. </p>\n<p> John caught himself daydreaming about what it might be like to go on a date with Sherlock; to go to dinner, maybe walk in the park, and huddle close because of the weather. John shook his head and sighed. It clearly had been far too long since he\u2019d been on a date if he was fantasizing about it like a school boy, and Sherlock probably wasn\u2019t even interested in him. This was just a crush, he told himself, and he needed to move on.</p>\n<p> Someone sat on the bench next to him and John looked over, a little annoyed. There was an entire fountain square full of empty benches, and the stranger had chosen to sit at his. He was well-dressed, wearing a fine wool coat and shiny black shoes. He appeared to be a little older than John and had an overall polished appearance. John thought he looked like a man who knew how to get what he wanted. John\u2019s posture changed; he sat up a little straighter and held himself a little more tensely. </p>\n<p> \u201cHello,\u201d he said easily. \u201cNice evening tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt is, John, but I\u2019m not here for the weather,\u201d the stranger replied with a slight smirk.</p>\n<p> John\u2019s eyes widened in surprise for just a moment before narrowing in suspicion. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d he said in a cool tone.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou are correct, though you have met someone I know rather well,\u201d the man said smoothly.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, of course. So what is it? Do we have the same barber? Same mailman?\u201d John replied sarcastically, not appreciating the man\u2019s secretive behavior.</p>\n<p> The man frowned, making the wrinkles on his forehead pronounced. It seemed like that was an expression he made often. \u201cI believe you know Sherlock Holmes? And his son, Henry?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI might. And since you already seem to know way too much about me, I\u2019d like a name in return if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d John said, wearing a matching frown.</p>\n<p> \u201cMycroft. Mycroft Holmes,\u201d came the reply.</p>\n<p> \u201cSo...Sherlock\u2019s brother, then?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> Mycroft nodded. \u201cYes, though I\u2019m sure if he could choose a title for me it might be more along the lines of \u2018enemy.\u2019 He is fairly dramatic about our relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, he mentioned you once. You\u2019re one of the people Henry speaks to, right?\u201d John asked, though at the moment he wasn\u2019t quite sure why anyone would voluntarily chat with this man.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d Mycroft agreed. </p>\n<p> \u201cBut you aren\u2019t here to talk about Henry, are you?\u201d John ventured.</p>\n<p> \u201cFor the most part, no. What is the nature of your relationship with Sherlock?\u201d Mycroft asked without any preamble. </p>\n<p> Caught off guard, John\u2019s cheeks turned a light shade of pink. He hoped it could be attributed to the cold, but when he saw the small smirk return to Mycroft\u2019s face, his hopes were dashed. </p>\n<p> \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d John replied, having had just about enough of Mycroft\u2019s invasive behavior. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, but I think it is,\u201d Mycroft replied in an annoyingly patient tone. \u201cHe is my brother, and therefore my business.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe is a grown man,\u201d John retorted, almost feeling annoyed on Sherlock\u2019s behalf. He\u2019d known of overbearing fathers and mothers, but he\u2019d never heard of an overprotective brother. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he can take care of himself.\u201d</p>\n<p> Mycroft merely stared at him, as if he had all the time in the world to wait on John\u2019s reply.</p>\n<p> John sighed. \u201cOur relationship has been friendly but professional. I went to dinner at his apartment at Henry\u2019s request. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p> Mycroft arched an elegant eyebrow. \u201cIs it, though?\u201d</p>\n<p> Feeling his cheeks grow warmer, John frowned. \u201cYes. Anything else would be inappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p> To his surprise, Mycroft chuckled. \u201cIt seems that you and my brother have similar notions. Unnecessary, though.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe - what?\u201d John asked; not his most intelligent response.</p>\n<p> Mycroft provided no clarification as he stood gracefully, poised with his umbrella at his side. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll speak again soon, Mr. Watson,\u201d he said. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p>\n<p> John watched him walk away, trying to process the thoroughly weird meeting that had just occurred. He never did find out how Mycroft knew about him; he thought it unlikely that Sherlock had told him. The part he most wanted clarification on, though, was that he and Sherlock had \u2018similar notions.\u2019 Did that mean Sherlock had no interest in him and found the idea of dating his son\u2019s teacher reprehensible? Or was he interested in John, but like John, wasn\u2019t sure if it was appropriate?</p>\n<p> He sat on the bench a while longer, lost in thought. When his toes began to feel icy, he stood up and headed back home, hands in his pockets and head bent against the brisk wind that had picked up, tossing brightly colored leaves around in its wake.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> The next day at school was fairly uneventful, which was good because John was still distracted by his odd meeting with Mycroft the previous night. He considered asking Sherlock about it, but decided it might be weird to call him and say, \u201cHey, your brother tracked me down in a park and knew all about me, then asked about our relationship. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p>\n<p> It was raining, so in lieu of going outside John\u2019s class was having indoor recess. John loathed indoor recess because it always ended up being barely controlled chaos no matter what he did, especially at the end of the day. Ah well; only five more minutes and then it would be time to pack up. </p>\n<p> He was seated at his desk organizing the morning worksheets for the week when a student appeared at his side. John rarely got much work done during indoor recess or free choice time since students were continually coming up to tell him a story, show him a picture, or tattle on another student. The third one happened far more often than he\u2019d like.</p>\n<p> It was Henry, holding a paper which he held out to John almost shyly. John was prepared to praise the picture and then tell Henry to put it in his mailbox to take home, but when he saw it he paused with a sense of unease. </p>\n<p> The picture was of Sherlock, Henry, and himself. They were outdoors, and they were all smiling. They didn\u2019t appear to be doing any activity, and there was the ever-present Bluebell at Henry\u2019s feet. It looked very much like a picture a child might create if they were asked to draw a picture of their family. </p>\n<p> \u201cThis is great, Henry,\u201d John said with a smile that was a tad forced. \u201cI like all your details. Is that Bluebell?\u201d he asked, pointing to the rabbit.</p>\n<p> Henry beamed and nodded, obviously very pleased with himself, and it made John\u2019s heart hurt a little to know that someone was going to have to explain to Henry that life and families weren\u2019t as easy to put together as drawing a picture. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell, nice job. You can go put it in your mailbox to take home, all right?\u201d John asked, attempting to hand the paper back to Henry. </p>\n<p> Henry shook his head and pointed to John. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s for me to keep?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and smiled.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell thank you very much. It\u2019s lovely,\u201d John replied. Henry nodded, and then headed back to the art table where Grace appeared to be coloring a rainbow and composing a song about ponies at the grocery store.</p>\n<p> Looking back down at the picture lying on his desk, John sighed. He had a problem.</p>\n<p>*** </p>\n<p> After school, he dialed Sherlock\u2019s number. Sherlock picked up after two rings.</p>\n<p> \u201cHi, this is John Watson,\u201d John said, feeling like his stomach was doing its level best to turn inside out. \u201cDo you think we could meet? Preferably somewhere with Henry out of earshot. I think there\u2019s something we need to talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p>John should have been more clear on the phone. What if Sherlock thought this was a date? No, of course he didn\u2019t. John was sure he hadn\u2019t sounded excited on the phone. He had probably sounded something more along the lines of \u2018nervous\u2019 and \u2018very serious.\u2019 He had told Sherlock that it was to do with a drawing Henry had done and that it was nothing to be worried about even though he himself was in the process of worrying about it quite a bit.</p>\n<p> In hindsight, he probably could have resolved the issue over the phone. However, he had to admit that a part of him was glad for the chance to meet with Sherlock in person again, even if it was over a conversation that was bound to be awkward. John knew he was probably overreacting to the picture and that it most likely didn\u2019t mean anything except that Henry liked his dad and John. Still, it might be better to be safe than sorry in this sort of situation. </p>\n<p> Sherlock had agreed to meet him at four-thirty that afternoon at a nearby coffee shop, which didn\u2019t give John much time to clean up the room and get things ready for the next day. He hastily put out the morning work at each student\u2019s spot, then sharpened the pencils in the dull pencils basket. Sometimes it felt like he was forever sharpening pencils. When that was finished, he got out the supplies he\u2019d need for the lessons the next day and then took a quick glance at himself in the classroom\u2019s bathroom mirror. He looked tired, had marker stains on his fingers, and some glue had dried on the hem of his sweater. Sighing, he shouldered his bag and locked the classroom door. He didn\u2019t need to look his best; this was simply a meeting to discuss a drawing, not a date. And probably an unnecessary meeting, at that. However, Sherlock had agreed readily and that combined with what Sherlock\u2019s mysterious brother had said left John with a tiny ray of hope that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to extinguish.</p>\n<p> It was a short walk to the coffee shop, and John found that he had arrived a little early. He ordered a coffee and put a generous amount of half-and-half in it. He found black coffee to be much too bitter and often really only drank it for the caffeine. Occasionally he did have a craving for it, and this was one of those times. Otherwise, he would have ordered tea.<br>\nScanning the room for an empty table, he found one in the corner against the window. One one hand, he was glad it was a two-person table as he usually felt guilty for taking up a large table that a family or a bigger group could have used. On the other hand, the two-person table made things seem much more intimate, and this was not a date. John sighed and sipped at his coffee; this was probably all in his head and there was nothing to be worried about at all.</p>\n<p> Unfastening his bag, he pulled out a folder with Henry\u2019s drawing inside and set it on the table, then got out his planner and began going over things for the next week. If he wanted to keep on schedule, he was going to have to somehow squeeze in six math lessons next week, which was not going to be easy. It was hard enough to do five. Maybe he could combine two of them, because really the only thing he could put off was handwriting but he didn\u2019t want to get behind in that as well. He sighed in frustration. There was so much curriculum to get through and not enough hours in the day.</p>\n<p> John was so absorbed in his planning that he didn\u2019t notice Sherlock\u2019s approach until the man pulled out the chair across from him. Startled, he looked up quickly and relaxed only a modicum when he realized it was Sherlock.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he said as he moved his things out of the way. \u201cI guess I was more wrapped up in planning than I realized. That, or I\u2019m more tired than I realized,\u201d he said with a sheepish grin.</p>\n<p> \u201cNot a problem,\u201d Sherlock replied, returning John\u2019s grin with a small smile of his own. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine having to take charge of twenty-five five-year-olds every day.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cTwenty-eight, actually,\u201d John said with a rueful smile. \u201cBudget cuts.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh, of course. Well, even more congratulations for your efforts are in order, then,\u201d Sherlock replied smoothly, taking a sip of his drink.</p>\n<p> A slight blush tinged John\u2019s cheeks and he ducked his head, fussing with the papers sticking out of his planner. \u201cRight, well. Thanks. I do my best, but when there are that many kids it\u2019s just not enough,\u201d he added a little sadly.</p>\n<p> \u201cBe that as it may, I do appreciate your efforts with Henry,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cSpeaking of whom...\u201d he trailed off, looking at John expectantly.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh! Right. Um, I\u2019m probably making a bigger deal out of it that it is, but I just...well, Henry\u2019s a very sweet kid and I don\u2019t want to see him hurt,\u201d John explained as he pulled out the picture and handed it to Sherlock, whose expression betrayed no reaction. \u201cHe gave this to me today, for me to keep. Does he usually draw things like that? I mean, I don\u2019t want to give him the wrong impression,\u201d John said, then closed his mouth before he started to babble.</p>\n<p> Sherlock\u2019s gaze flashed to John before settling back on the drawing, but his expression was unreadable. At length, he spoke. </p>\n<p> \u201cI can\u2019t say that he does, actually,\u201d Sherlock admitted. \u201cHe often draws pictures of him and myself - and Bluebell, of course,\u201d he said with a slight smile and roll of his eyes. </p>\n<p> \u201cI thought - well, it looks a lot like a picture a kid would draw of his family,\u201d John said hesitantly. \u201cDoes he think - has he talked to you about this at home?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAre you attempting to ask if Henry thinks we\u2019re dating?\u201d Sherlock asked with an amused smile, and John wondered if Sherlock was enjoying his discomfort. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be opposed to the idea.\u201d</p>\n<p> Did that mean Sherlock wouldn\u2019t be opposed either? John took a sip of his coffee to give himself time to think. Sherlock took John\u2019s silence to mean that he could continue talking.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe speaks of you more frequently at home, ever since you came to dinner. He also asked again why I didn\u2019t want to - oh, how\u2019d he put it - \u2018get him a mommy or another daddy,\u201d Sherlock said, a flash of sadness distorting his features.</p>\n<p> \u201cAgain?\u201d John asked quietly.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe first time was when you\u2019d begun that unit on families,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cI...try to be enough for him, but sometimes I\u2019m not sure if I am.\u201d He looked equal measures embarrassed and uncomfortable, and John wondered why Sherlock was admitting what were clearly very private feelings to his son\u2019s teacher. Maybe he didn\u2019t have many people to talk to.</p>\n<p> John resisted the sudden urge to rest his hand on Sherlock\u2019s arm in a comforting gesture. \u201cThere are plenty of single-parent families that function just as well as two-parent families - sometimes even better,\u201d he assured him. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert, but from what I\u2019ve seen you\u2019re providing him with a wonderful life. It\u2019s probably just a phase,\u201d he said, though he wasn\u2019t as sure on the last part. </p>\n<p> Sherlock nodded. \u201cThank you. My apologies; I didn\u2019t intend on becoming so personal about it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, it started out as a pretty personal topic,\u201d John replied with a smile to ease the tension. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable. Anyway, maybe you could just explain to Henry that relationships take time and the right person has to be involved, that you can\u2019t force something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d need to,\u201d Sherlock said softly, his blue-silver gaze trained steadily on John. John felt his cheeks flush wholeheartedly, but before he could reply Sherlock stood gracefully.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to get back - Mrs. Hudson is watching Henry and I promised I wouldn\u2019t be gone long,\u201d he explained with a smile that was partially a knowing smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Henry and see what I can do. However, I should warn you that once he sets his mind on something he can be very persistent.\u201d With a wink and sweep of his coat, Sherlock was gone. </p>\n<p> John stared after him for what felt like quite some time, his mind racing to catch up with what had just occurred. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Sherlock felt rather confident as he walked away from the cafe, a smug smile on his face. He had left John sitting there gaping in astonishment like a fish out of water, but had a feeling John wouldn\u2019t hold it against him. Sherlock was already intrigued by John, and there was no doubt that John would be intrigued now as well. Making that suggestion to his son\u2019s teacher was perhaps a risk, but Sherlock had never been one to play it safe. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When John finally recovered and began putting his things away, he noticed a scrap of paper on the table that hadn\u2019t been there before. In an angular, spidery scrawl it read:</p>\n<p> <i>Thursday. 4:30p. Here, if convenient.</i></p>\n<p> With a rush of anticipation, John grinned and tucked the note carefully in his planner and headed home.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaddy, where\u2019d you go?\u201d Henry asked as they walked up the stairs to their apartment.</p>\n<p> \u201cI went to meet with Mr. Watson,\u201d Sherlock said.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh,\u201d Henry replied, jumping up the last two steps. \u201cWell how come I didn\u2019t get to come?\u201d he asked, the beginnings of a pout hovering around his mouth. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt was a grown-up meeting,\u201d Sherlock replied. Before Henry could ask any more questions, he added, \u201cMr. Watson showed me the picture you gave him.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, I drawed it during free choice time,\u201d Henry explained as he pulled out his box of Legos. \u201cCan you help me build a spaceship?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry wasn\u2019t acting like his picture was anything out of the ordinary, Sherlock noted as he sat down on the floor next to his son. Perhaps it was just a picture and nothing more. </p>\n<p> \u201cCan Mr. Watson come over again?\u201d Henry asked as he fitted a black Lego between two red ones.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm, I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019d have to ask. He might not have time,\u201d Sherlock replied. He went with that excuse rather than \u2018he might not want to\u2019 because Sherlock was almost certain that John would in fact want to. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell yeah he probably does,\u201d Henry said in a reasonable tone. \u201cHe has lots of time after school to do whatever he wants \u2018cause he\u2019s a growned-up.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock hid a smile. If only being a \u2018growned-up\u2019 actually meant getting to do whatever you wanted. He made a mental note to share that with John on Thursday, assuming he\u2019d show up. Sherlock had no doubts that he would.</p>\n<p> \u201cSo why did you draw a picture of you, Mr. Watson, and me?\u201d Sherlock asked, trying to sound casual. \u201cWhy not just you and Mr. Watson?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>And</i> Bluebell,\u201d Henry added, lest Sherlock somehow forget. \u201cI drawed all of us \u2018cause we all like each other and I want Mr. Watson to have a picture of you too. \u2018Cause he gots pictures of all of us at school from the first day, but he doesn\u2019t got a picture of you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe doesn\u2019t <i>have</i> a picture,\u201d Sherlock patiently corrected. \u201cAnd why would he need a picture of me?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry rolled his eyes as he attached a wing to his spaceship. \u201c\u2018Cause it\u2019s good to have pictures of people you like and your friends and stuff,\u201d he said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.</p>\n<p> Sherlock wasn\u2019t sure where Henry had gotten that notion, though he expected it was from Mrs. Hudson, who kept framed pictures of her family and friends all about her apartment. </p>\n<p> \u201cHenry,\u201d Sherlock began hesitantly. Wording things delicately and sensitively had never been his strong suit. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Mr. Watson and I are <i>friends</i> exactly. We\u2019ve talked a few times, but I\u2019m not sure that qualifies as being friends.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBein\u2019 friends is easy, Daddy. You just be nice and play together and share stuff, like me and Grace do,\u201d Henry explained.</p>\n<p> Clearly Sherlock needed advice on how to approach this conversation, so he decided to let it go for now. <br> \u201cYes, all right. It sounds like you\u2019ve learned a lot about being a good friend at school,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p> \u201cYep! Some kids aren\u2019t good at it but I\u2019m really good at it. I share all the time. Daddy!\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more later. I gotta go save Bluebell from pirates!\u201d he yelled as he grabbed his spaceship and ran up to his room.</p>\n<p> Sherlock chuckled as he watched Henry go. Space pirates; that was a new one. Reaching for his phone, he quickly typed out a text.</p>\n<p>I need some advice. And don\u2019t you dare breathe a word of it to anyone or I won\u2019t assist on any more cases. SH</p>\n<p>You liar, you can\u2019t resist. You\u2019d be begging for cases within two days. GL<br>\u2028Only the really interesting ones. SH</p>\n<p>Right. So what\u2019s up? GL</p>\n<p>Henry drew a picture of himself, his teacher, and me together. SH</p>\n<p>Ohoho. He\u2019s the guy you had over for dinner, right? GL</p>\n<p>How did you know about that? SH</p>\n<p>Henry told me the other day. GL</p>\n<p>Of course. Then I\u2019ll start out by saying there\u2019s nothing going on between us. SH</p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t say there was, but now I\u2019m a little suspicious since you got so defensive. GL</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t being defensive. Are you going to help or not? SH</p>\n<p>Yeah, yeah. What\u2019s the problem? GL</p>\n<p>I think Henry may be hoping that John and I will begin a romantic relationship. Or at least become friends. SH</p>\n<p>So? GL</p>\n<p>Well how do I tell him that might not happen? SH</p>\n<p>Do you want it to happen? GL</p>\n<p>Irrelevant. SH</p>\n<p>I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty damn relevant. GL</p>\n<p>It would be inappropriate. SH</p>\n<p>Why? Because he\u2019s Henry\u2019s teacher? Are you going to avoid associating with his pediatrician as well? Or his dentist? etc. GL</p>\n<p>Ah, \u2018etc.\u2019 An excellent way to close your argument. SH</p>\n<p>And what a great way to avoid the question. By the way, this would be a lot easier if you\u2019d just call me. GL</p>\n<p>I prefer to text. SH</p>\n<p>Obviously. Do you want to date John? GL</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter. SH</p>\n<p>Stop being a self-righteous dick and answer the question. GL</p>\n<p>Yes. SH</p>\n<p>Then ask him out. Simple as that. GL</p>\n<p>I want to meet this guy, by the way. He must be pretty extraordinary to have gotten your attention. GL</p>\n<p>What do I tell Henry if it doesn\u2019t work out? SH</p>\n<p>That\u2019s setting yourself up for failure. Cross that bridge if you come to it. GL</p>\n<p>If this all goes wrong it\u2019s completely your fault. SH</p>\n<p>I take full responsibility. GL</p>\n<p> Pocketing his phone, Sherlock sighed and went to the kitchen to clear away his equipment so he could make dinner, still unsure what to do.</p>\n<p>John awoke on Thursday feeling like he\u2019d already had two shots of espresso, all because he was meeting one of his students\u2019 parents at a coffee shop after school. Except this time it wasn\u2019t just a meeting; John was fairly certain this time it was an actual date. </p>\n<p> The note from Sherlock was set out on John\u2019s kitchen counter, as if he might somehow forget about it. Impossible, considering he\u2019d spent nearly every spare moment thinking about it. Still, he had to admit he liked looking at Sherlock\u2019s spidery scrawl even if it did make him feel a little as though he were acting like a lovesick middle schooler. </p>\n<p> After a quick shower, John spent an unusually long amount of time picking out his clothes. On ordinary days he didn\u2019t put much thought into it. Clothes were clothes, and as long as they did the job and he looked fairly presentable, he was content. Sherlock was a sharp dresser, though, and John felt the need to impress. Or at least attempt it. Finally settling on dark grey slacks and a light blue sweater, he had to go through the rest of his morning routine fairly quickly in order to get to school on time.</p>\n<p> Today John had to do reading assessments, which weren\u2019t exactly his favorite but there were worse assessments out there, so he didn\u2019t complain. His biggest issue was that it was boring, for both the students and himself. It had to be done, though, so he was thankful that the other literacy centers seemed to be running smoothly because that gave him more time to get assessments done.</p>\n<p> The class was halfway through the literacy block when an argument broke out at the writing center. At this point in the year, their writing still consisted largely of pictures with labels, though some students attempted a sentence or two in the lined space underneath the drawing area. </p>\n<p> Wishing they had waited to argue until after he had finished the assessment he was doing, he got up and walked over, growing more concerned as he saw that Henry was in the writing center group.</p>\n<p> \u201cPirates can go to outside space if they want to!\u201d Grace shouted. It appeared she was defending Henry\u2019s drawing. Henry sat still, glancing nervously from one girl to the other.</p>\n<p> \u201cOutER space,\u201d Sophia replied, poking a crayon in Grace\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd no they can\u2019t \u2018cause there\u2019s no oceans there so what\u2019s their boat gonna go on?\u201d she demanded.</p>\n<p> \u201cMy friends at writing center,\u201d John began in a serious tone, \u201cit is way too loud over here. What\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, though he was well aware of the situation. He had learned early on that kids would not let it go until they were sure their side of the story had been heard. </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s face had brightened when he saw John, but quickly returned to the nervous expression from before. John wanted to reassure him that it would be fine, but that would take away from the lesson he was trying to impart to the arguing students.</p>\n<p> \u201cSophia said Henry\u2019s picture was wrong \u2018cause his pirates went into outside space,\u201d Grace said hurriedly.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell it is wrong!\u201d Sophia protested. </p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d John said, then posed a question. \u201cWhen we\u2019re at free writing center, is it okay to write about whatever we want to?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not <i>real</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd sometimes we only write about things that are real,\u201d John agreed. \u201cBut when it\u2019s free writing center, we can write about things that are pretend, too. So is it okay for Henry to write about pirates in outer space?\u201d he asked gently.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh. Yeah, okay,\u201d Sophia replied, looking a bit put out that she hadn\u2019t been right.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood. Now remember to use your whisper voices, and don\u2019t forget to use lots of good details like we talked about,\u201d John reminded them with a smile, then returned to the reading table. He was thankful it had been a simple misunderstanding; with his date looming in the near future, he wasn\u2019t sure if he had the capability to deal with actual trouble very effectively right now.</p>\n<p> It wasn\u2019t like John to get so worked up about a date. He was quite good at them, in fact. The flirting, the easy laughter; it all came naturally to him. He\u2019d never had a date with someone like Sherlock before, though. Even though John knew mind-reading was something out of comic books, he couldn\u2019t entirely convince himself that Sherlock was not capable of it. There was something about his eyes, something slightly other-worldly that made it seem possible. </p>\n<p> When at long last the school day came to an end, John did his usual end-of-the-day routine, complete with a check in the mirror to make sure he looked presentable. To his surprise, he had managed to make it through the day unscathed and still looking rather good, in his opinion. </p>\n<p> Gathering his things, he left school feeling excited and nervous. It had been such a long time since he had been on a date, and he wasn\u2019t sure why. It wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t want to date, but it had taken a backseat to his job without him really noticing. And it did get tiring trying to find someone exciting and interesting who didn\u2019t spend the entire date talking about their cats or the trip they had just taken to Colorado with their ex. That had been weird.</p>\n<p> John slowed when he realized he was about a block away from the coffee shop, then came to a complete halt in a sudden fit of worry. Ever since he\u2019d tucked Sherlock\u2019s note away after their last meeting, he\u2019d been convinced that this was okay. If he wanted to get to know someone better, he should be able to. It shouldn\u2019t matter that the particular someone had a son in John\u2019s class. </p>\n<p> This is what he had repeated to himself until he believed it, but now they seemed more like excuses or coverups than reasons. He got out his phone and fiddled with it, considering sending Sherlock a message that he couldn\u2019t make it. No matter what excuse he gave, though, he was certain Sherlock would see right through it and John didn\u2019t want Sherlock thinking that he was a coward.</p>\n<p> Eventually he got his feet moving again and arrived at the coffee shop in short order. He went to order something because he felt awkward when he walked into an establishment like this and didn\u2019t purchase anything. This time he got tea; he didn\u2019t need an overdose of caffeine jangling his already shaky nerves. As he had stood in line, he had surreptitiously scanned the shop and located Sherlock, seated on a small love seat tucked away in the back near the table they had sat at the first time. </p>\n<p> Tea now in hand, John took a deep breath, steadied his nerves, and walked over.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John was late. Sherlock looked over at the door for what felt like the thousandth time as the bell chimed, but it was a short black woman in a business suit. Defense attorney, happily married, and decidedly not John. </p>\n<p> Taking a sip of his coffee, he barely noticed the strong, bitter tones as he began to second guess his decision. He knew John was interested, and he had been certain that John would be agreeable to another meeting. A more personal one this time, and perhaps lengthier as well. </p>\n<p> But four-thirty and come and gone, and there was no sign of John. Not even a text to say he was running late. That was when Sherlock began to wonder if he had been stood up, though that didn\u2019t seem like the sort of thing John would do. Then again, how well did he really know John? He knew things <i>about</i> John, and he could extrapolate from those to form a hypothesis, but he didn\u2019t know for certain. </p>\n<p> He intended to find out. </p>\n<p> His gaze snapped to the door as the bell chimed once again, and this time was rewarded by the sight of a tense-looking John. Sherlock smiled into his coffee. He was not being stood up; John had simply been second-guessing his decision. Perfectly reasonable considering his obviously high moral standards.</p>\n<p> Sherlock looked up with a small smile as John approached. \u201cHello, John,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a seat. I would have tried for a table, but as you can see, they\u2019re all full,\u201d he added, gesturing around the room. In truth, he was pleased the couch was the only available seating as it implied a more intimate atmosphere than a table would have. </p>\n<p> \u201cRight, thanks,\u201d John replied, sitting so that there was still a small amount of space between them but not so far over that he was crammed against the arm of the couch. \u201cSo, how have you been?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cJust fine,\u201d Sherlock replied, wishing people didn\u2019t insist upon pleasantries before getting to actual conversation. \u201cCould do with a bit more excitement. My caseload has been slow, which I suppose is good for the general populace,\u201d he said begrudgingly.</p>\n<p> That earned him a grin from John. \u201cYes, terrible that crime is down,\u201d he joked. \u201cWhat do you do when you don\u2019t have cases to work on, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d John asked, settling in as he relaxed into the conversation.</p>\n<p> \u201cI run a website and occasionally take on clients from there, but usually the cases they have are laughably easy or boring,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it unless there\u2019s actual brainwork to be done.\u201d</p>\n<p> John raised his eyebrows. \u201cEven if it helped people?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> Ah, of course. Sherlock took a sip of his coffee, then replied, \u201cMuch of it is petty. A husband cheating on his wife and the wife wanting revenge, a sibling who thinks they have been cheated out of their fair share of the inheritance, someone whose dog\u2019s gone missing. Dull,\u201d he pronounced.</p>\n<p> John nodded, \u201cYeah, I can see how that would become tedious.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cVery much so,\u201d Sherlock replied emphatically. \u201cThough once in a while an interesting one will pop up. Recently I discovered that a mother was killing her step-children with a <i>snake</i> that she let loose in their beds. Can you believe that! It\u2019s as though she was asking to be caught. There are plenty of easier ways to -\u201d Sherlock cut off as he realized the look John was giving him meant he was bordering on \u2018not good.\u2019 \u201cI simply meant - well, it was certainly unusual,\u201d he finished somewhat lamely. </p>\n<p> John seemed to accept Sherlock\u2019s transition back into the world of acceptable. \u201cUnusual indeed,\u201d he smiled. \u201cSo - again, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how does Henry deal with the death that seems to go hand-in-hand with your cases?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, he\u2019s very practical about it,\u201d Sherlock replied with a hint of pride. \u201cHe knows that everyone dies at one point or another, and some people die in unpleasant ways. He also knows that the people who die will be missed by people who cared for them. He\u2019s quite mature about it all.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d John replied. \u201cIt can take kids a while to understand how death works. I know I\u2019ve said it before, but Henry really is a very bright kid.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock smiled. \u201cThank you. I think so as well.\u201d</p>\n<p> The conversation progressed easily, and Sherlock told John about a few more of his cases. John listened eagerly, interjecting with several \u2018amazings\u2019 and \u2018fantastics.\u2019 As they talked, the space between them shrank until their knees were brushing frequently. This was going far better than Sherlock had expected. Perhaps Mycroft and Greg were right and this was something he could have.</p>\n<p> Before Sherlock knew it, it was six o\u2019clock and he was due to pick up Henry. Both men stood simultaneously, and Sherlock\u2019s breath grew shallow as he realized he only need lean in a few inches and he could kiss John. John was watching him intently, pupils dark as he licked his lips. Those were all the signs Sherlock needed; it was clear that John wouldn\u2019t mind if Sherlock kissed him. Sherlock lowered his head, intending to give John a chaste goodbye kiss, but at the last moment John jerked away. </p>\n<p> \u201cI - um, I\u2019m sorry. I have to go. Thank you, I had a great time. I really did,\u201d John said earnestly. \u201cI just - I can\u2019t - thank you,\u201d John stammered, and with a sad smile he left the shop.</p>\n<p> Sherlock watched him go, feeling let down and foolish. He should have never attempted to kiss John on their first date. They hadn\u2019t even clarified that it was an actual date until the very end, for God\u2019s sake. <i>This</i> was why Sherlock stayed far away from the world of dating. </p>\n<p> It never ended well.</p>\n<p>That had not gone as planned.</p>\n<p> Then again, Sherlock hadn\u2019t planned on kissing John on their first date. Had John even known it was a date? Neither of them had mentioned it specifically, but surely John had to have known. He had certainly acted like he was on a date. As for the almost-kiss, John had given every sign that he was agreeable to the notion, but pulled away at the last second. Sherlock wondered if he had scared John off for good. Then again, John had seemed almost regretful of his decision, so perhaps there was still hope.</p>\n<p> Realizing he was attracting attention by standing and staring at the door, Sherlock gathered up and disposed of their trash then headed home at a brisk pace. He couldn\u2019t help thinking that a case would be a nice distraction, so he pulled out his phone and quickly typed out a text.</p>\n<p>I need a case. SH</p>\n<p>Date didn\u2019t go well, I take it? GL</p>\n<p>This was a terrible idea. SH</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not as bad as you think. GL</p>\n<p>I tried to kiss him. SH</p>\n<p>Good god. You really don\u2019t do anything by halves, do you? GL</p>\n<p>It is not funny. SH</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little funny. What happened after? GL</p>\n<p>He apologized and left. SH</p>\n<p>Well if you want to kiss him, maybe next time you should try it after taking him to a nice place for dinner instead of trying to kiss him in the middle of a coffee shop. GL</p>\n<p>Next time? What makes you think there will be a next time? SH</p>\n<p>What makes you think there won\u2019t? GL</p>\n<p>I embarrassed him and made an idiot of myself. SH</p>\n<p>God you\u2019re dramatic. It really isn\u2019t that big of a deal. Just ask him to dinner. GL</p>\n<p>And what reason could he possibly have to say yes? SH</p>\n<p>Quit being a baby and do it. I don\u2019t have a case for you anyway. GL</p>\n<p>Once again, you have been entirely unhelpful. SH</p>\n<p>You\u2019re welcome. GL</p>\n<p> Sherlock shoved his phone back in his pocket as he entered his building and went to pick up Henry from Mrs. Hudson, sighing in frustration.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John regretted his decision to leave the shop almost immediately. Why hadn\u2019t he just let Sherlock kiss him? John had wanted to, and perhaps that is what had scared him into leaving. He had been so quick to imagine kissing Sherlock, spending quiet evenings with him, and taking Henry to the park or the museum. John shook his head, thinking he shouldn\u2019t be able to slot himself so easily into someone else\u2019s life. </p>\n<p> He didn\u2019t even know Sherlock that well, and he hardly believed in the concept of love at first sight or soul mates. Yes, it was important to find a person who complemented you, but relationships took work. John had had many partners over the years, and many of them were lovely, interesting people. They just hadn\u2019t been the right fit; it always felt like something was missing. When John was with Sherlock, it felt different. Then again, he hadn\u2019t spent very much time with the man, so how could he really tell? Maybe this was all in his head.</p>\n<p> John pulled out his phone to call Sherlock and apologize then ask him to dinner, but he hesitated. That might make him seem needy and desperate. The best thing to do, he decided, was wait a few days and see how he felt then. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> The kids were packing up and John breathed an inward sigh of relief. The full moon had coincided with a Friday, which made an already wild day even more hectic. People laughed when he told them the theory, but if you worked with kids you knew that they always got wilder whenever a full moon rolled around. John didn\u2019t have any science behind that fact, just experience. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to hear teachers commiserating every month, attributing the kids\u2019 behavior to what was essentially a giant space rock. It sounded crazy, but John believed in it wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p> John made his way through the maze of backpacks, lunch boxes, coats, and kids to the \u2018mailboxes,\u2019 a slotted shelve where students stored their folders and papers than needed to go home, like notes, finished work, and drawings. </p>\n<p> Pulling out two folders, he called, \u201cDrew! Athena! Come get your folders!\u201d over the din. While he was handing the folders to the kids, a man around his age with grey hair approached the open classroom door, moving to the side to avoid a particularly determined child dragging a very full backpack into the room.</p>\n<p> \u201cHi, can I help you?\u201d John asked. It wasn\u2019t unusual for parents to occasionally pick up their kids a few minutes early, but he hadn\u2019t gotten a note from anyone and he didn\u2019t recognize the man at the door. </p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m Greg Lestrade,\u201d the man said, offering his hand. John took it, noting the firm, professional grip of his handshake. \u201cSherlock Holmes asked me to pick up Henry for him today.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh,\u201d John replied, picking up loose papers on the table and straightening them out. \u201cIs he working on a case?\u201d</p>\n<p> Greg looked at him initially with surprise, then with a smirk and one eyebrow raised. \u201cHe told you about that, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p> John was confused. \u201cUm, yes. Should he...not have?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Greg laughed. \u201cHe just usually doesn\u2019t bother talking with people more than he has to. I\u2019m the detective he works with,\u201d Greg explained.</p>\n<p> John\u2019s eyes lit in understanding. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re one of the people Henry talks to, right?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cYep,\u201d Greg said with a smile. \u201cLast time I was over he told me all about school. And you,\u201d he added, his smile widening into a grin.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood things, I hope,\u201d John laughed.</p>\n<p> \u201cNothing but the best about Mr. Watson,\u201d Greg replied.</p>\n<p> \u201cJohn, please,\u201d John said. \u201cI think Henry\u2019s just about ready, so you can take him whenever he\u2019s set to go.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI can see why they both like you,\u201d Greg said casually, looking out across the room.</p>\n<p> Caught off guard, John could feel the tips of his ears growing pink. He wasn\u2019t so sure Sherlock liked him all that much now that John had rejected him and then run out. \u201cWell, one of them does anyway,\u201d he said lightly, keeping an eye on a few kids who tended to dawdle and conveniently avoiding Greg\u2019s gaze should it happen upon him.</p>\n<p> \u201cListen,\u201d Greg said hesitantly. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Sherlock act this way about anyone. He barely even speaks to anyone twice if he can help it,\u201d he added with a wry laugh. \u201cThis is probably way out of line, but I, ah...heard about what happened the other day and I think you should give him another chance. He\u2019s a great man, and he\u2019s well on his way to being a good one. It wouldn\u2019t hurt him to have a little help, though,\u201d Greg said with a sidelong glance and a grin.</p>\n<p> John\u2019s cheeks flushed, and thankfully Henry chose that moment to come over. He smiled and waved at Greg, his overlarge Avengers backpack on his shoulders. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou all set to go, Henry?\u201d John asked, happy to have an excuse to end the conversation. </p>\n<p> Henry nodded and gave him a thumbs-up. </p>\n<p> John laughed. \u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll see you Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p> He was thoroughly distracted through the rest of dismissal, thinking about what Greg had said.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Later than night, John was perusing the shelves of a book store on a whim when a man a few years younger than him with a lovely smile approached him and began flirting. John was surprised that he felt conflicted as this was a very attractive man, but ended up agreeing to a date on Saturday night. He felt slightly guilty, though he tried to ignore it. It wasn\u2019t as if he was actually dating Sherlock, and maybe a date with someone else would help John figure out what to do about the situation he was in. He left the store with no books, but a phone number and a date.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> On Sunday Sherlock\u2019s phone alerted him to a text, and he rolled his eyes in annoyance when he realized it was from Mycroft.</p>\n<p>John went on a date over the weekend. If you still want a chance at him, you\u2019d best do something about it. MH</p>\n<p> Sherlock put down his phone, stretched out on the couch, and began making plans.</p>\n<p>John\u2019s date went well. David took him to a nice restaurant, but it wasn\u2019t too fancy that it made John uncomfortable. They had interesting conversation, and it became clear partway through dinner that David either intended to take John home or go home with John. John felt a pang of guilt for a short moment, but reminded himself that he wasn\u2019t actually dating Sherlock and had perhaps put Sherlock off altogether. </p>\n<p> They ended up going back to David\u2019s place. They drank the wine David poured for them and chatted a bit, but it wasn\u2019t long before they ended up in the bedroom. Much of the night had been spent not sleeping, and in the morning John felt a weary satisfaction that he hadn\u2019t experienced in quite a while. Stretching pleasantly, he lingered over a cup of coffee and smiled at David, who was cleaning the kitchen.</p>\n<p> \u201cSorry I have to get going so soon,\u201d David said as he wiped down the counter. \u201cI would have loved to stay in bed a little longer,\u201d he added with a sly grin.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s probably just as well,\u201d John mused with a mock-serious expression. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for all that activity.\u201d</p>\n<p> David laughed and threw a towel at John\u2019s head, which hit its mark and fell into his lap. \u201cOh, stop,\u201d he protested. \u201cI could barely keep up with you last night. It was amazing,\u201d he added, almost shyly.</p>\n<p> John smiled and got up to wash his mug, but David took it from him and placed it in the dishwasher. \u201cI had a great time, too,\u201d John assured him, and was surprised to find that it was true. Maybe his feelings for Sherlock were just a crush. Still, there was an excitement that came from being with Sherlock that he hadn\u2019t found with David, but on the other hand being with David was relaxing and held a strong sense of comfort and normality.</p>\n<p> The question was, did John want normal?</p>\n<p> After a brief kiss and goodbye outside David\u2019s apartment, John headed back to his place feeling a little conflicted but mostly pleased with himself. That was why he hadn\u2019t noticed the black car tailing him until he stopped at a crosswalk and the window slid down. </p>\n<p> \u201cJohn. Get in, would you?\u201d came the smooth voice from inside. John recognized it and frowned.</p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t think so. My mom told me to never get in the car with strangers,\u201d John replied, willing the light to change color.</p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019re hardly strangers, though, are we?\u201d Mycroft replied. </p>\n<p> \u201cLook. If you have something to say, say it,\u201d John said flatly. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll thank you to leave me alone.\u201d John could only assume this had something to do with his date with Sherlock, and he really did not want to talk about it with Sherlock\u2019s mysterious, bordering-on-creepy brother. </p>\n<p> \u201cVery well,\u201d Mycroft replied with a hint of annoyance. John could see him as he stepped closer to the car; he was dressed to the nines and had a look on his face to match his tone. \u201cI realize my brother doesn\u2019t have the keenest grasp on social venues, especially when it comes to romance and relationships. I would urge you to give him another chance.\u201d</p>\n<p> John rubbed the back of his neck uneasily. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p>\n<p> \u201cI could make it worth your while,\u201d Mycroft said. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to offer an amount I believe is more than fair-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat?\u201d John spluttered, cutting him off. \u201cYou\u2019re offering to <i>pay</i> me to date your brother, like some sort of escort?\u201d </p>\n<p> Mycroft shrugged, as if the suggestion didn\u2019t bother him in the slightest. \u201cCall it what you will, but if you don\u2019t enjoy the date then at least you would have gotten something out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d John said forcefully. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. Does he know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOn the contrary, he gets upset when I \u2018meddle in his life,\u2019 as he so dramatically puts it. However, he doesn\u2019t always realize when he needs help,\u201d Mycroft replied smoothly.</p>\n<p> \u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d John said shortly. \u201cI think I can make up my own mind about what I\u2019d like to do, and I certainly don\u2019t need any bribes to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p> The light changed, and John walked away from the car with short, angry strides. He was offended and a little creeped out. Maybe it was a sign that he shouldn\u2019t pursue things with Sherlock after all, if events like that were going to happen. However, he did wonder if he should call Sherlock and let him know that his brother was going around offering people money to date him. John would certainly want to know if his sister was doing that to him. Yes, he would be mortified, but he would still want to know.</p>\n<p> When he got back to his apartment he had cooled down enough to think rationally and decided that he should let Sherlock know what had happened. That might get Mycroft to stop bothering him as well. He pulled out his phone and was about to dial when he took the coward\u2019s route and decided to text instead. This wasn\u2019t really a conversation he wanted to have via voice as it promised to be extremely awkward.</p>\n<p>Hi, this is John Watson. This is a little awkward, but I thought you should know that your brother offered me money to go on a date with you. JW</p>\n<p>Did you take it? SH</p>\n<p>What? No, of course not. JW</p>\n<p>Pity. We could have split it. SH</p>\n<p>We what? He basically treated me like an escort, you realize. JW</p>\n<p>Would you like to go to dinner? SH</p>\n<p> John stared at his phone, not quite believing what he was reading. Apparently he hadn\u2019t scared Sherlock off. It also appeared Sherlock wasn\u2019t the romantic type. A dinner invitation over text didn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018let me woo you.\u2019 That was just fine, though; John didn\u2019t want to be wooed. He wanted to get to know someone...which is what he had been doing with David. The Sherlock-David debate came back in full force, but in the end there wasn\u2019t much of a contest at all. And he and David had gone one one date; it wasn\u2019t as though they were in a relationship either. His reply was quick and succinct. </p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to. JW</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> It seemed that when it came to John Watson, none of Sherlock\u2019s plans ever went accordingly. Ideally he had wanted to talk to John face-to-face and apologize for trying to kiss him, then ask if he\u2019d be willing to try again - a do-over, if you will. Failing that, Sherlock would have talked to him on the phone; he could be charming when he deigned to be. But no, in the midst of an embarrassing revelation about his brother\u2019s actions, he instead invited John to dinner out of the blue without his carefully planned apology.</p>\n<p> And John had said yes.</p>\n<p>Treasure this moment, because it will probably be the only one in the foreseeable future in which you were right. SH</p>\n<p>About what? GL</p>\n<p>John, obviously. He accepted my dinner invitation. SH</p>\n<p>See? Told you that you were making too big a deal out of it. But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t text just to tell me I\u2019m right. GL</p>\n<p>Yes. There is a minor problem. He said \u2018I\u2019d love to.\u2019 Love. SH</p>\n<p>Good god you really are out of touch sometimes. That\u2019s a good sign. It means he\u2019s looking forward to it. GL</p>\n<p>Ah. Yes. Of course. SH</p>\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve become your personal relationship counselor. Maybe I should start charging fees. GL</p>\n<p>Fine, I\u2019ll assist you on any horrifically dull case you want. SH</p>\n<p>Excellent. Hope dinner goes well! GL</p>\n<p>Your hopes bear no effect on the outcome of the dinner, but they are appreciated. SH</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John had not only agreed to dinner, but to dinner that night. That meant he would be with two men in the same day, which made him feel a little more promiscuous than he actually was. Ah well; what was done was done, and he wasn\u2019t going to stop himself from enjoying this date. They were going to meet at Angelo\u2019s, an Italian restaurant that was somewhere between classy and casual and was fairly close to both of their homes. Sherlock had said he knew the manager there and John loved Italian food, so it seemed like as good a place as any. </p>\n<p> Sherlock was there when John arrived, waiting outside. He smiled as John approached and a flurry of butterflies erupted in John\u2019s stomach as he returned the smile. As soon as they entered the restaurant, a man John assumed to be Angelo greeted them.</p>\n<p> \u201cAh, Sherlock! It\u2019s been a long time; you must visit more often. But what a lovely man you\u2019ve brought!\u201d Angelo said with a large wink and in a loud enough voice to make John blush, certain the whole restaurant was staring at them \u201cCome, I have a cozy little table in the back that will be perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p> The table was pretty perfect, John had to admit. It was tucked away in the corner with a soft light ensconced in the wall. There was a small flickering candle on the table as well, which John thought was perhaps a bit much but he appreciated Angelo\u2019s enthusiasm all the same. </p>\n<p> \u201cSo how do you know Sherlock?\u201d John asked the large man, missing the look of slight alarm that crossed Sherlock\u2019s face.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, we go back quite a way,\u201d Angelo chuckled. \u201cThis genius here got me off a murder charge, believe it or not! Proved I was in an entirely different part of town robbing a store! Those were the old days, though. I\u2019m a reformed man, now. Life gave me a second chance and I took it! I\u2019ll be right back with some wine for you boys,\u201d he said with another wink.</p>\n<p> John looked at Sherlock in surprise for a moment, then laughed. Sherlock relaxed into his seat with a small smile and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true, and he has been kind to me every since we met. As I\u2019m sure you can tell,\u201d he said wryly.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe restaurant of an ex-thief,\u201d John said with an almost-giggle. \u201cYou certainly know how to show a man a good time.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, well, I wouldn\u2019t want things to be dull, now would I?\u201d Sherlock asked with a smirk.</p>\n<p> \u201cI don\u2019t think things with you would ever be dull,\u201d John said in a moment of sincerity that surprised them both. Before either of them could get too flustered, Angelo arrived with the wine and took their orders.</p>\n<p> Much like the previous times they had spent together, conversation flowed easily and John felt as though everything was a little more vibrant. All too soon the restaurant had emptied out and it was time for them to leave.</p>\n<p> They lingered outside the restaurant, chatting in close proximity. John was determined to have a better end to this date than the last one. Realizing his gaze had dropped to Sherlock\u2019s lips, he refocused on Sherlock\u2019s entire face - not before Sherlock had noticed, however. With a small smirk, the taller man stepped closer and there was no question about his intent. This time when Sherlock leaned in to kiss John, John moved to meet him. Their lips met gently, warm and soft. When Sherlock pulled back just slightly, John\u2019s eyes fluttered back open, though he didn\u2019t remember closing them. </p>\n<p> \u201cI...do you want to come back to my place?\u201d John breathed, throwing caution to the wind and acting on instinct instead.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t,\u201d Sherlock replied, still only inches away. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, yeah, of course,\u201d John stammered in embarrassment. \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou misunderstand me,\u201d Sherlock murmured in a voice that John found far too sexy for his own good. \u201cI\u2019d be very agreeable to going home with you, but I haven\u2019t set up overnight accommodations for Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p> How could John have forgotten? \u201cRight, yeah,\u201d he said with sheepish smile. Then, taking a bit of a chance, he added, \u201cMaybe next time?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDefinitely next time,\u201d Sherlock replied, leaning down to kiss John one more time. John wanted so much more, but he could wait.</p>\n<p> \u201cThanks for everything. I had a wonderful time,\u201d John said, though \u2018wonderful\u2019 didn\u2019t quite do it justice.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou are very welcome. I had a wonderful time as well,\u201d Sherlock replied. He took John\u2019s hand and gave it a squeeze, then let it go. \u201cTalk to you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\u201d John said with a smile stretching across his face. \u201cGoodnight, Sherlock.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGoodnight, John.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now <i>that</i> was a night Sherlock could count as a success.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Daddy did you go on a <i>date</i> last night?\u201d Henry asked with equal amounts of curiosity and disgust when they got home from school. \u201cMrs. Hudson said <br>you went on a <i>date</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock hesitated. He hadn\u2019t intended to broach this subject until he was more certain about things. He had a longstanding policy of not lying to Henry, though, as he didn\u2019t believe in coddling children and shielding them from the truth. \u201cYes, I did. Is that all right?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry mulled over the question as he got out the baking soda. While the baking soda and vinegar combination was an exceedingly simple reaction to create, it amused Henry to no end and he often requested to do this particular experiment. Sherlock got down the food coloring from a high shelf, just to make it a little more interesting.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah. But Grace says that dates are so people can get married. Are you getting married?\u201d he asked as he sifted through several bottles to find the correct vinegar. </p>\n<p> \u201cShe\u2019s correct; dates are good ways to find out whether you get along with another person and to get to know them better,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cBut a date doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to get married.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHm,\u201d Henry said as he dumped a liberal amount of baking soda in a bowl. A fine white cloud puffed up and gently coated Henry\u2019s curls. He stopped to look at Sherlock, a slightly uncomfortable look on his face. \u201cGrace said that on dates people <i>kiss</i>. Is that true?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh. Well, yes,\u201d Sherlock answered, hoping the questions stopped at kissing.</p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSo you <i>kissed</i> somebody?\u201d he asked, mildly horrified.</p>\n<p> \u201cI did,\u201d Sherlock replied with a small smile as he remembered the moment. \u201cThough dates don\u2019t have to include kissing.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGross,\u201d Henry replied, making a face as he mixed red food coloring with the vinegar, splashing it on the counter as he did so. \u201cWell then I\u2019m never going on dates,\u201d he announced.</p>\n<p> Sherlock chuckled. \u201cI think you might change your mind when you\u2019re older. If you don\u2019t, though, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh I won\u2019t,\u201d Henry promised. \u201cOkay, are you ready for the \u2018speriment?\u201d he asked excitedly, as if they hadn\u2019t done it a hundred times before. He adjusted his goggles over his eyes and picked up the pitcher of colored vinegar dramatically. Without waiting for Sherlock to answer (because daddies were always ready), he poured the vinegar into the bowl of baking soda. </p>\n<p> He giggled and then jumped back as the concoction hissed, fizzed and bubbled its way over the edges of the bowl, onto the counter, then down to the floor. </p>\n<p> \u201cOops!\u201d Henry cried gleefully, not one bit remorseful for the mess he had made. When the reaction died down, he pulled a long row of paper towels from the counter onto the mess, not bothering to tear them off. Sherlock leaned over to assist, but froze as he heard Mrs. Hudson coming up the stairs. When she poked her head through the door, an astonished look appeared on her face. Father and son both looked at her with matching guilty expressions.</p>\n<p> \u201cMy goodness, boys! What a mess!\u201d she exclaimed.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt was just an explosion,\u201d Henry sheepishly explained. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy\u2019s it gone all red? It looks like someone\u2019s been murdered up here!\u201d she replied, tossing a hand in the air in exasperation. </p>\n<p> \u201cJust food coloring, baking soda, and vinegar, Mrs. Hudson. Nothing that can\u2019t easily be cleaned up,\u201d Sherlock explained. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell, yes, all right. See that you do,\u201d she said with a mock frown and a twinkle in her eye. </p>\n<p> \u201cDid you need something?\u201d Sherlock asked expectantly.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh! Yes, I\u2019d almost forgotten what with the...explosion,\u201d Mrs. Hudson replied. \u201cI just wanted to check in on you after last night. How was your date with that lovely teacher fellow?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s head shot up from where he had been sopping up the experiment on the floor. Sherlock\u2019s cheeks flushed, and Mrs. Hudson remained entirely oblivious to the fact that Henry hadn\u2019t known who Sherlock\u2019s date was. </p>\n<p> \u201cAh, good. Yes, it was good. A nice evening,\u201d he replied. Not one of his most graceful coverups. </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDaddy, did you go on your date with <i>Mr. Watson</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p> Thus far there had only been a few times where Sherlock wished Henry wasn\u2019t so good at making deductions, and this was one of them. \u201cI did. If it bothers you, I won\u2019t do it again,\u201d he said sincerely. While he would very much enjoy pursuing something with John, Henry was most important person in his life and he always came first.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Henry said slowly, processing the new information. \u201cBut...\u201d he trailed off.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes?\u201d Sherlock asked, suddenly apprehensive.</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy,\u201d Henry said, his large grey eyes very serious. \u201cYou have to promise you\u2019re not gonna kiss Mr. Watson ever ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock laughed and ruffled his hair, then said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You need to finish cleaning up this mess.\u201d</p>\n<p> With a long-suffering sigh and a general disdain for cleaning up that he undoubtedly got from his father, Henry set about soaking up the remains of the red bubbly liquid.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> To put it lightly, John was in a good mood. There was still a lingering feeling of \u2018maybe I shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u2019 but it was mostly squashed by the knowledge that things had gone well with Sherlock and that there was going to be another date. He also still felt a little foolish that he had sort of forgotten about Henry at the end of the date, and hoped Sherlock didn\u2019t think badly of him for it. He had considered texting Sherlock an apology, but then decided that Sherlock hadn\u2019t seemed offended by it at all and perhaps it was best left forgotten. </p>\n<p> He noticed that all throughout the school day Henry kept shooting him glances with an almost smug smile on his face, which John had dismissed as a ridiculous notion because what did a five-year-old have to be smug about? Something was definitely up though, and by the end of the day it dawned on John that Henry might know about the date. He would have to ask Sherlock to find out for certain, and in the meantime he supposed he could be thankful that Henry wasn\u2019t upset about it.</p>\n<p> John\u2019s class had music at the end of the day on Tuesdays, which was nice because it gave him a chance to get things ready for the next day, meaning he could leave school a little earlier. Checking his phone for the time because the clock in his room always managed to be a few minutes off, he was surprised to see a notification for a text from Sherlock.</p>\n<p>I realize this is last minute, but would you be able to meet after school? I thought we might make plans for the weekend, if you\u2019re amenable. SH</p>\n<p>Are you sure you don\u2019t want to meet just so you can see me? JW</p>\n<p>John hoped the teasing relayed well via text.</p>\n<p>Ah, you\u2019ve caught me out. SH</p>\n<p>Good. And yes, that would be great. Same place? 4 work for you? JW</p>\n<p>Yes. Mrs. Hudson will be by to pick Henry up as I\u2019ll be out working until then. SH</p>\n<p>Sounds good. See you then. JW</p>\n<p> After dealing with a child who was absolutely convinced she was supposed to go home with a parent rather than on the bus (and it turned out that she was indeed supposed to take the bus), John was glad to get out of the school. The fact that he had now had something of a personal life was pretty exciting, and he marveled at it as he went to meet Sherlock.</p>\n<p> John arrived first this time, ordered some tea, and sat down on the small love seat they had occupied the last time - the time that didn\u2019t go so well. John was confident that they would not have a repeat of that, though, considering what they were here to talk about. When Sherlock walked in, John couldn\u2019t help the broad smile that stretched across his face.</p>\n<p> \u201cHi,\u201d John said when Sherlock sat down next to him in a great sweep of his coat.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d he asked with an expression that told John he knew perfectly well how John was.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, all right. Getting that text from you was a nice surprise,\u201d John replied with a smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm, perhaps I\u2019ll send them more often then,\u201d Sherlock replied with a wink. An honest-to-God-wink. It took John a moment before he remembered to shut his mouth.</p>\n<p> \u201cSo, this weekend, I\u2019m mostly -\u201d John began, but was cut off by his phone ringing. Frowning, he looked at a number he didn\u2019t recognize.</p>\n<p> \u201cNot someone you know?\u201d Sherlock asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cDon\u2019t think so. I\u2019m supposed to be getting a new student this week, though, so it might be about that. Do you mind if I take it?\u201d he asked apologetically.</p>\n<p> \u201cNot at all,\u201d Sherlock replied.</p>\n<p> John swiped his thumb across the screen to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHey, it\u2019s David,\u201d came the voice on the other end. John\u2019s face paled.</p>\n<p> <i>Shit.</i></p>\n<p> \u201cHi David, how are you?\u201d he asked as he walked quickly to the doors and outside the coffee shop. This must be a work number, and he was an idiot for forgetting to call things off with David sooner. Shit.</p>\n<p> \u201cPretty good. Listen, I had a great time on Saturday and I was wondering if you were free this Friday?\u201d he asked, a definite hopeful note to his voice.</p>\n<p> John felt extremely guilty and was not looking forward to explaining this. \u201cI - ah, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I went on a date before I met you and I thought I\u2019d missed my chance with him - well, I actually wasn\u2019t entirely sure if it was a date,\u201d he rambled. \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t need to know that. The thing is, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see him again, and now I have, and I\u2019d like to continue seeing him. And I think you\u2019re a fantastic person and I truly did have a nice time with you, but he\u2019s...well, I can\u2019t really explain it. Which isn\u2019t fair to you, I suppose. I just...I think I fit better with him,\u201d John ended lamely, hoping that somewhere in that outpouring of explanation was something that made sense to David.</p>\n<p> There was a small pause on the other end of the line. \u201cI see. I mean - yeah, I get it.\u201d His voice was tinged with hurt.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, David. I should have been more up front about it,\u201d John apologized.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. Just - if you two don\u2019t work out, give me a call, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d John replied, and they hung up. </p>\n<p> As he walked back into the coffee shop, he was sure what had just occurred was written all over his face. \u201cWell, with all your deductive skills I\u2019m sure you can figure out what that was all about,\u201d he said a bit miserably as he sat back down. </p>\n<p> Sherlock was sitting stiffly, an unreadable look on his face. \u201cYou had been on a date after our first date,\u201d he began. \u201cThough I suppose neither of us actually clarified that it was a date. You went out with him Friday or Saturday - probably Saturday, and spent the night with him. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t look so guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p> In a fit of cliche, John wished the couch would open up and swallow him whole. He nodded silently.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019ve broken things off with him, and he took it well. You wish he had been angry, because you feel you deserved it. His kindness was harder for you to bear,\u201d Sherlock added.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sherlock,\u201d John replied. \u201cIt\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t know if we were actually dating or anything and he was nice-\u201d</p>\n<p> A flash of jealously contorted Sherlock\u2019s face before he schooled his features back into the blank-slate look.</p>\n<p> \u201cEr - I mean, well. I didn\u2019t intend to hurt either of you, and once I found out you wanted to continue things I meant to call things off with David. Which I obviously forgot about,\u201d John added with a self-depreciating roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I would ask from this point on that we remain exclusive,\u201d Sherlock said, unaware that such a request was considered a fairly serious one by many people.</p>\n<p> John wasn\u2019t bothered in the least. \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he said with a small smile. \u201cSo...this weekend?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p>\n<p> Sherlock mirrored his smile. \u201cYes. Would Friday or Saturday be preferable to you?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cFriday sounds lovely,\u201d John replied immediately, then wondered if he shouldn\u2019t have picked Saturday so as not to sound overeager.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood. I preferred Friday as well,\u201d Sherlock said. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a sleepover for Henry with his friend Grace. He\u2019ll be going to her house. I was a bit worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate if need be, but he assured me that Grace always knows what he\u2019s talking about. Is that...have you noticed this to be the case?\u201d he asked, slightly worried.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s as if she can read his mind,\u201d John replied reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m honestly beginning to wonder if she can\u2019t,\u201d he added with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. Speaking of Henry, does he know about us?\u201d John asked, a little more bluntly than he intended to.</p>\n<p> \u201cAh. Well...yes,\u201d Sherlock replied, a pink flush dusting his cheeks. \u201cPerhaps I should have consulted you first, but he asked and I make it a point to be honest with him. So, yes. He knows. But he has made me promise never to kiss you, so I will have to adhere to that promise,\u201d Sherlock said with a serious look.</p>\n<p> John studied him for a minute, trying to decided if Sherlock was serious or joking. He decided on - and hoped for - joking. \u201cMm, well, we\u2019ll just have to be very sneaky then,\u201d he said, the corner of his mouth turned up in a half-smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cAgreed,\u201d Sherlock said with a smile of his own. \u201cSo seven pm Friday, then?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSounds excellent,\u201d John agreed.</p>\n<p>The apartment was a disaster. John would be there in an hour, and it looked as though a small whirlwind had taken up residence during the last week. Wondering how that had happened, he realized the whirlwind\u2019s arrival coincided with Mrs. Hudson\u2019s absence. Despite her claims of not being their housekeeper, it seems she did a lot of tidying up for them. Now that she had left for a week to visit her sister, her hard work was made very clear by the state of the apartment. Sherlock hadn\u2019t even noticed how messy it had gotten, and Henry might have noticed but said nothing because the less cleaning he had to do, the better. </p>\n<p> Henry had been nervous to stay away from home for the night, but Sherlock promised him he could call to be picked up any time. He seemed assured, and once he was at Grace\u2019s house and rolling around on the floor with the litter of puppies the family dog had given birth to a month prior, all traces of hesitancy were gone. Sherlock left his number with Grace\u2019s parents, but was fairly certain they wouldn\u2019t need it.</p>\n<p> Now he rushed around the apartment attempting to clean up, and after he had cleared out the worst of it, he gave up. Sherlock was many things, but unless it was about his personal appearance, tidy was not one of them. Deciding John would prefer having Sherlock look good than the apartment look good, he got in the shower and planned out the night in his head.</p>\n<p> John would arrive, they\u2019d chat for a bit, then go out to dinner. After dinner they would go back to one of their apartments, most likely Sherlock\u2019s because it was somewhat familiar to John whereas John\u2019s was unknown to Sherlock, and because Sherlock had asked John over to his in the first place. Then they might have a post-dinner drink or coffee - probably something alcoholic in nature to ease the nerves. Then again, maybe not. John had seemed very sure of what he wanted last time they had met. Sherlock remembered the low intensity of John\u2019s voice, which had made his skin tingle in anticipation. It had been a question, but after his initial hesitation there had been an undertone of \u2018do as I ask,\u2019 which Sherlock found quite thrilling.</p>\n<p> Realizing he was running out of time, Sherlock waded out of the memories to find that his cock had taken a decided interest in Sherlock\u2019s reminiscing as well. He rolled his eyes and ignored it as he turned off the water and stepped out, grabbing a towel to dry off. He did not have time for that.</p>\n<p> Not long after, Sherlock was impeccably dressed in black slacks and a lavender button-down shirt. He left off the jacket for now, knowing full well that he posed an intimidating figure when dressed in a full suit. His hair was artfully styled, a few curls falling over his face in just the right places. Sherlock knew he was attractive and wasn\u2019t above using it to his advantage. That, and he knew John appreciated the way he looked, though he hadn\u2019t actually said anything about it. He didn\u2019t need to. His body language practically screamed it. Absently, Sherlock wondered if John knew how much he gave away just through the motions of his body and his responses. Probably not.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Sherlock was nearly vibrating out of his skin when the bell finally rang. He met John at the door, who looked very handsome himself. He had on a dark blue jumper that brought out his eyes. After a polite exchange of hellos, Sherlock led John up to the apartment, depositing him in the living room as he got them each a glass of wine. He paused in surprise when John held out a bag (containing a book, Sherlock noted in a glance).</p>\n<p> \u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d really want flowers,\u201d he said with a smile.</p>\n<p> Sherlock accepted the bag and pulled out a book about apiology. He regarded it and then in turn John with surprise. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou mentioned last time that you found bees fascinating, so I thought you might enjoy it,\u201d he explained with a shrug.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, it\u2019s - it\u2019s really excellent. Very thoughtful,\u201d Sherlock replied, overcompensating for his former silence. \u201cI look forward to reading it.\u201d He found he was quite touched by John\u2019s gesture and fought his every instinct to put his guard up. For once he needed to not sabotage himself and give this a chance. John listened to his stories with actual interest, so he was worth not scaring off simply for that - not to mention his other intriguing qualities.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood,\u201d John said, clearly relieved to see that his gift had been well-received. \u201cSo did you have any ideas for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI thought I\u2019d let you pick this time since last time you were at my mercy,\u201d he replied, the corners of his mouth twitching upward.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe food was fantastic last time,\u201d John assured him. \u201cHow do you feel about Thai?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI haven\u2019t had it in a while. Sounds delightful,\u201d Sherlock said.</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right. I know a good place not far from here,\u201d John said, pleased. \u201cAnd what do you think about getting it to go and bringing it back here?\u201d he asked hesitantly. \u201cTheir food is great but the dining atmosphere isn\u2019t the best,\u201d he explained.</p>\n<p> Sherlock considered this. After their last date he had been eager to go home with John, and would have done so if it weren\u2019t for his responsibilities. Now, however, it seemed he had backtracked in his willingness to be intimate even though they both were undoubtedly aware that\u2019s what this night was about. Eating dinner at a restaurant would have allowed Sherlock to ease into things, but bringing the food back to his apartment felt abrupt.</p>\n<p> Seeing his hesitation, John hurriedly said, \u201cEating there would be fine. It\u2019s a little noisy, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll manage fine,\u201d he added with a reassuring smile.</p>\n<p> Sherlock hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been thinking long enough for John to notice. \u201cAh, no, eating here is all right. I\u2019d like to be able to have a conversation without needing to shout,\u201d he said smoothly. </p>\n<p> \u201cGood, then. We could walk, if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Sherlock replied as he put on his coat, then led John out the door.</p>\n<p> They ordered and got their food, and Sherlock was glad he had agreed to eat at his home. The place, while clean and well-managed, was loud and it would have been difficult to converse. As they walked back, food steaming in a plastic bag, John slid his hand into Sherlock\u2019s so naturally that at first Sherlock didn\u2019t react, as if it were something they did all the time. When he did react, it was only to squeeze John\u2019s hand and smile slightly as they walked, fallen leaves crunching underfoot.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> They abandoned the table for the couch, sitting cross-legged and facing one another and eating straight out of the paper cartons as if they were college students rather than two full-grown men on a date. Sherlock relaxed quickly and told more animated tales about the cases he\u2019d assisted on, marveling at John\u2019s continued interest. John honestly thought Sherlock was amazing, and the way that made Sherlock feel was something he was loathe to let go.</p>\n<p> Stretching a leg out, Sherlock accidentally nudged John\u2019s thigh but John said nothing of it and Sherlock did not retract his long limb. This was nice, he realized. This companionable conversation, sometimes broken by comfortable silences as they ate. Just as he was contemplating how to achieve more physical contact with John without being too obvious, his phone chimed. He automatically put down his food and picked it up, frowning as he read the message. As he scanned the screen, his eyes began to light up.</p>\n<p> \u201cThis idiots couldn\u2019t solve their way out of a paper bag,\u201d he grumbled as he sat up straight. \u201cThere\u2019s been a robbery by a ghost, apparently. No one came in the door and the apartment\u2019s too high up to have entered from the outside. No fire escape,\u201d he said, unconsciously getting to his feet to pace around the room.</p>\n<p> John could see he was eager to investigate. \u201cSherlock, if you want to go check it out, that\u2019s fine with me. We can reschedule.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock looked up, as if he had momentarily forgotten John was there. \u201cOr you could come with me,\u201d he offered. \u201cEver been to a crime scene?\u201d he asked with a smug grin.</p>\n<p> \u201cCan\u2019t say that I have, though I\u2019ve been to war so I imagine I can handle it,\u201d John replied with a broad smile as he got up, already reaching for his coat.</p>\n<p> As it turned out, the crime had been committed by backing a truck up to the building and using a series of ladders to climb to the window, which the owner always left unlocked thinking no one could get to it anyway. After some asking around, they obtained a description of a truck that had been lingering near the building for several days prior to the break-in, and Sherlock set off to find it with John in tow. </p>\n<p> They did find it, and waited in hiding until the owner came to drive away. There was a spirited chase through several alleys until John managed to cut him off and tackle him to the ground. Twisting the man\u2019s arm behind his back to immobilize him, John was out of breath and feeling alive when Sherlock caught up to them. They grinned at one another as the teenage boy underneath John cursed.</p>\n<p> After Lestrade arrived to take the boy in for questioning, John and Sherlock headed back to Sherlock\u2019s flat, both giddy with the night\u2019s excitement. Sherlock let John into the flat, who stood in the entryway with his back against the wall, catching his breath and giggling.</p>\n<p> \u201cThat was ridiculous,\u201d he said between gasps. \u201cThis is by far the best date I have ever been on.\u201d</p>\n<p> That statement took Sherlock by surprise, which mean the wasn\u2019t paying attention to the upturned rug and promptly tripped over it and right into John\u2019s arms. He might have thought about how that was a cliche straight out of a romcom, if he ever watched that sort of thing. His immediate reaction was to apologize, but he found that no words were forthcoming as his senses was overwhelmed by the feeling of being pressed against John. </p>\n<p> John gave a small gasp as Sherlock fell into him, bracing his hands on Sherlock\u2019s hips to keep him upright. As he tilted his head up, Sherlock was surprised and pleased to see that John\u2019s pupils had widened, leaving only a ring of dark blue encircling them. Of course, that could be because of the dim lighting in the entryway, but Sherlock knew that was only one of the contributing factors. Sliding his fingers along the side of John\u2019s neck against his pulse point, he confirmed his theory. John\u2019s heart rate would be higher than normal due to the excitement of the case, but at this point it wouldn\u2019t be this high unless there was another factor - he was aroused.</p>\n<p> Slowly Sherlock inclined his head to meet John\u2019s lips in a soft kiss. John\u2019s grip tightened on Sherlock\u2019s hips as he made a small noise, and then the kiss was no longer slow and sweet but intense and passionate, fueled by the adrenaline singing in their veins.</p>\n<p> Sherlock broke off the kiss with a gasp. \u201cUpstairs. Wouldn\u2019t want Mrs. Hudson to kick me out for lewd behavior,\u201d he smirked, taking John by the hand and leading him once again up the seventeen steps. John followed eagerly.</p>\n<p> Once inside with the door safely shut and locked, John stripped off his jacket and tossed it over a chair while Sherlock did the same, but John backed him against the door before he could do away with his scarf. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re really actually amazing,\u201d John murmured against his skin as he trailed kisses along his jaw, pulling his scarf off gently and letting it fall from his hand to pool on the floor. \u201cThey way you figure things out from practically no information - it\u2019s very sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock let his head fall back against the door, exposing his neck to John\u2019s ministrations and smiling at the idea of what he did for a living being \u2018sexy\u2019. He found that he had untucked John\u2019s shirt and that his hands were roaming over the warm skin of his back, though he didn\u2019t remember doing it. \u201cMm, bedroom?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cGod, yes,\u201d John agreed, backing away so Sherlock could lead on.</p>\n<p> John only had a moment to survey the bedroom before Sherlock crowded into his space, sliding his hands under John\u2019s shirt and tugging it off over his head.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh,\u201d he breathed, brushing his fingertips over John\u2019s scar. </p>\n<p> John looked uncomfortable. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s - just ignore it, if you can,\u201d he said, avoiding Sherlock\u2019s gaze. </p>\n<p> Sherlock shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d he said, tracing the outline of the puckered skin.</p>\n<p> Pink tinged John\u2019s cheeks as he asked, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d Sherlock assented. \u201cThis is an exit wound. Shot in the back, then,\u201d he said, mostly speaking to himself. He gently turned John around to trace his fingers over the entry wound. \u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p>\n<p> John stiffened, clenching and unclenching his left hand. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it,\u201d he said quietly.</p>\n<p> \u201cAh. Um, not good?\u201d Sherlock asked, slightly confused about what he\u2019d done wrong.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s just...personal,\u201d John said as he turned around, determinedly setting to work on the buttons on Sherlock\u2019s shirt, which he undid with quick efficiency. Sliding the shirt over Sherlock\u2019s shoulders and tugging it off, he let it drop to the floor to join his own. </p>\n<p> \u201cMy apologies,\u201d Sherlock replied, pressing his chest to John\u2019s as he kissed him, enjoying the feel of his warm skin. </p>\n<p> John soon forgot the incident and kissed Sherlock with renewed fervor, pressing him back against the bed. Sherlock laid down obligingly and John crawled on top of him, pressing kisses to random places on his chest. Sherlock\u2019s breath caught in his throat when he felt John\u2019s tongue on his nipple, so he pressed his palm against John\u2019s crotch in retort.</p>\n<p> John moaned and captured Sherlock\u2019s lips in another kiss, rocking his hips rhythmically against Sherlock\u2019s. It had been a long time since Sherlock had done this with anyone. Since before Henry was given into his care, in fact. He\u2019d always had superior control over his body, and sex became something he neither wanted nor needed. Well, he almost never needed it. Occasionally his body would require sexual release in order for him to be able to think properly, which he efficiently took care of on his own.</p>\n<p> It seemed that in that time he had forgotten how nice it was to <i>not</i> think and simply feel instead. He focused on John\u2019s weight on him, his smell of shampoo and sweat and tea, his slightly chapped lips against Sherlock\u2019s own. Sherlock craved more, and soon both men were divested of any remaining clothing. </p>\n<p> Wrapping a leg around John\u2019s, Sherlock flipped their positions with ease. John looked surprised but pleased, and Sherlock began a thorough exploration of his body. He longed to pay attention to the scar, to taste and feel and compare, but he didn\u2019t want to upset John again. Perhaps someday John would tell him about it, and then he would be comfortable letting Sherlock do just that. For now, Sherlock was mostly content mapping out every inch of John\u2019s body with care. </p>\n<p> John relaxed into his touch, becoming limp and pliable beneath his lips. Sherlock made his way up John\u2019s left arm and back to his lips, where he kissed John hungrily as he ground his hips purposefully and repeatedly against John\u2019s.</p>\n<p> They both gasped into the kiss; Sherlock because he\u2019d never done this with someone whose company he actually enjoyed, and John because he was already so sensitized to Sherlock\u2019s touch. They kept up a relentless pace, relishing the slide of skin on skin. </p>\n<p> It might have been minutes or hours for all he knew when Sherlock shuddered, his entire body tensing and then relaxing all at once. A couple more slick slides had John following soon after, and Sherlock collapsed half-on, half-off him in sleepy satisfaction. </p>\n<p> \u201cAmazing,\u201d John breathed as he gently carded his fingers through Sherlock\u2019s damp curls.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d was all Sherlock could manage, inhaling John\u2019s scent as he buried his face in the man\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p> \u201cWe should get cleaned up a bit,\u201d John added.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get up.\u201d</p>\n<p> John chuckled and eased himself from Sherlock\u2019s grasp. Finding his way to the bathroom, he wetted a washcloth and cleaned himself up, then returned to clean Sherlock as well. He made Sherlock get up so that he could pull back the covers, then they climbed into the bed together. They kissed lazily for a few minutes, enjoying each other\u2019s presence and the feeling of sated bliss. </p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d Sherlock murmured sleepily.</p>\n<p> \u201cFor what?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cThis. What we did. It was - good,\u201d Sherlock replied, finding it hard to express himself.</p>\n<p> \u201cThen I suppose I should thank you too. This was the best night I\u2019ve had in god knows how long,\u201d John murmured.</p>\n<p> \u201cSuppose we\u2019ll have to do it again,\u201d Sherlock said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to disappoint.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSuppose we will,\u201d John said with a soft smile.</p>\n<p> They lay murmuring to each other for a little while longer, then fell asleep in one another\u2019s arms as the noises of the city went on as always outside the darkened room.</p>\n<p>So, how was it? GL</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve already given you my full report on the scene. I\u2019m certain even your lot can take it from there. SH</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be a dick. I meant your date with John and you know it. GL</p>\n<p>Ah, so you want all the lurid details. SH</p>\n<p>Details of your sex life? No thanks. I just wondered how it went. GL</p>\n<p>Very well. SH</p>\n<p>I am pleased. SH</p>\n<p>Oh really? Must have been damn near perfect, then. He seems like a nice guy. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know him better. GL</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t. We\u2019re exclusive. SH</p>\n<p>For god\u2019s sake, Sherlock. I don\u2019t want to date him. He asked you to be exclusive already? That\u2019s a pretty big step. GL</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t ask. I told him. SH</p>\n<p>Oh my god. And he didn\u2019t dump you on the spot? GL</p>\n<p>No. Why would he? SH</p>\n<p>Generally exclusivity comes after dating a while. And you reach the decision together. GL</p>\n<p>We did. SH</p>\n<p>You are a very lucky man. GL</p>\n<p>Apparently so. SH</p>\n<p>You really are unbelievable. I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019ve got a lead. GL</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> The lead turned out to be multiple leads, and Sherlock had to arrange for Mrs. Hudson to pick Henry up from school. When she reminded him it was Halloween, he groaned. He was going to have to miss trick-or-treating with Henry, and that was not going to be lightly forgiven. Sherlock did his utmost to put Henry before the work, but sometimes it couldn\u2019t be helped. They were after a kidnapping ring that was taking children and selling them to the highest bidder, no questions asked, and Halloween would be a perfect night for them to strike. It was essential they be caught immediately.</p>\n<p> Mrs. Hudson could pick Henry up, but she couldn\u2019t take him trick-or-treating due to her bad hip. Lestrade couldn\u2019t do it for obvious reasons and Grace\u2019s family was out of town (Henry had been severely disappointed by this), which only left one person.</p>\n<p>I have a big favor to ask. You can say no. SH</p>\n<p>What is it? JW</p>\n<p>I\u2019m on a case and I can\u2019t take Henry trick-or-treating. SH</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll do it. Assuming that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to ask, that is. JW</p>\n<p>Yes. Thank you. I owe you. SH</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no problem. I bet he\u2019s not going to be very happy with you, though. JW</p>\n<p>You think so, too? SH</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all he\u2019s been writing about in writing workshop for the past two weeks. JW</p>\n<p>Damn. I might have to relent on the bunny issue. SH</p>\n<p>Maybe. What time should I be over? JW</p>\n<p>7. He\u2019ll be with Mrs. Hudson. She\u2019ll have him fed and ready to go. SH</p>\n<p>All right, sounds good. JW</p>\n<p>We\u2019re after a kidnapping ring, and Halloween would be an opportune time to strike. Ordinarily I do not put my work before Henry. SH</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine, I understand. If I had a kid I\u2019d probably feel the same. Good luck out there and be safe, okay? JW</p>\n<p>Of course. Thank you. SH</p>\n<p>No problem. JW</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John set down his phone, feeling an odd mixture of pleased and worried. He was concerned for Sherlock because it sounded like he was on a dangerous case, but he was pleased that Sherlock had asked him to take Henry trick-or-treating. He wondered what Henry would think about that, though. It was clear that he adored his dad and was extremely excited about Halloween, and John felt like he might seem like an intruder. </p>\n<p> Henry seemed to be okay with the fact that his dad and his teacher were dating, though John didn\u2019t know exactly what that meant to Henry. Maybe he thought John and Sherlock just liked to spend time together. Maybe he just didn\u2019t care. John would have to ask next time he saw Sherlock. </p>\n<p> Sifting through the papers on his desk, he looked up at the clock. Five minutes until the kids came back from lunch and recess. He sighed and sat back, deciding to give himself those five minutes to relax. Halloween was a fun day, but extremely busy. Thanks to the continuing popularity of Marvel superheroes, he had several Iron Mans again this year - one of which was Henry. There were many princess, a ninja turtle, a ghost, a witch, a power ranger, a bunny, two pirates, and a Batman, among other things. </p>\n<p> The remainder of the day flew by in a flurry of Halloween activities, and suddenly it was time to pack up. John called Henry over to his desk to explain the evening, since Sherlock wouldn\u2019t be able to do so himself. </p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, Mrs. Hudson\u2019s going to be picking you up today. Your dad\u2019s on an important case and he can\u2019t leave.\u201d John hesitated, trying to figure out the best way to continue. Henry\u2019s features were already transitioning from cheerful to disappointed. \u201cWhich means he won\u2019t be able to take you trick-or-treating tonight.\u201d And there it was, the crestfallen look of the utterly disappointed. Sherlock was going to owe him for this, because he did not like to be the one responsible for the look on Henry\u2019s face. \u201cHe asked if I would take you. I could do that, if you want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry looked thoughtful for a moment, clearly torn between being disappointed that his dad couldn\u2019t go with him and being excited that he could go with his teacher. Finally he nodded and gave John a small smile, then went to finish packing up his things.</p>\n<p> Well, at least that had been settled without too much trouble. Grabbing the dismissal clipboard, he began calling out the names of the bus kids to line up.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>I would advise against letting Henry trick-or-treat tonight considering what you\u2019ve been up to. MH</p>\n<p>I have it under control. SH</p>\n<p>Do you? Because I\u2019m fairly certain the kidnapping ring has yet to be apprehended. They know you\u2019re after them; what better way to hurt you than by seizing your heart? MH</p>\n<p>Poetry, really? Enough with the dramatics. Everything will be fine. In any case, I won\u2019t be with him, as I am working. SH</p>\n<p>Oh? MH</p>\n<p>John\u2019s taking him. SH</p>\n<p>Interesting. You trust him with your son\u2019s life so soon? MH</p>\n<p>Yes. You don\u2019t know him, so I will thank you to refrain from commenting. SH</p>\n<p>Oh, but I do. Not as...intimately as you, perhaps. MH</p>\n<p>What? SH</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say we\u2019ve chatted. MH</p>\n<p>Ah yes, your bribe. Tell me brother, how did that go? SH</p>\n<p>As expected. We conversed beyond that, as well. MH</p>\n<p>I really couldn\u2019t care less what you think; John\u2019s taking Henry out tonight. SH</p>\n<p>And I think he is a fine choice. MH</p>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t matter what you think anyway. I have work to do. SH</p>\n<p>Of course. Best of luck. MH</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t need it. SH</p>\n<p> After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Sherlock brought the conversation with John up on his phone and typed a quick message.</p>\n<p>A ring of kidnappers is...less than pleased with me. Tonight could be dangerous. SH</p>\n<p> The reply was quick, and made the corners of his mouth twitch up in a small smile.</p>\n<p>I went to war. I think I can handle it. Plus I\u2019m nearly out of candy so getting bite-sized versions by begging for it seems like the best course of action. JW</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John showed up at 221 Baker Street a little before seven. Not ten seconds after he\u2019d rung the buzzer, Henry was opening the door to let him in with Mrs. Hudson trailing happily in his wake. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh John, it\u2019s good to see you again! I\u2019m so glad things are working out so well for you and Sherlock,\u201d she said with a fond smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boy and he\u2019s always so alone up there. He deserves someone - another grown-up, of course,\u201d she said with a wink to Henry, \u201cto share his life with. So it\u2019s a good thing you came along!\u201d Before John had a chance to tell her that they\u2019d just started dating and that while he was enjoying it, it was still early days, she continued with, \u201cHave you eaten, dear? Henry\u2019s just finished eating so there\u2019s plenty of food left.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI actually ate before I came, but thanks for the offer,\u201d John replied with a smile. \u201cAnd I imagine Henry\u2019s ready to get going.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry nodded enthusiastically and grabbed his treat collecting pumpkin bucket in one hand and took John\u2019s hand in his other, hauling him towards the door. </p>\n<p> John laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you later, Mrs. Hudson,\u201d he called, and the door shut neatly behind them.</p>\n<p> Since Henry wasn\u2019t inclined to contribute to conversation, John kept up an easy flow of chatter as they went building-to-building and door-to-door, and Henry replied in expressions and gestures. Despite Sherlock\u2019s warning, it was a fun and danger-free night, and more than once John imagined what this might be like if it was his normal life rather than doing a favor for the man he was dating. Could he be a parent? When he was younger he\u2019d always pictured himself as having a family with a few kids, but as he got older it seemed like the time for that came and went. Perhaps his outlook had simply changed. He did know that if he continued to date Sherlock, having Henry in his life would be an excellent bonus.</p>\n<p> They set off back to Baker Street once Henry\u2019s bucket was nearly overflowing, and when the arrived John was pleased to see that Sherlock was there. Henry bounded up the steps to their apartment and proudly showed Sherlock his haul, then proceeded to dump it all out in the middle of the living room floor to sort through for the best pieces. </p>\n<p> \u201cThank you for doing this for me,\u201d Sherlock said as he pulled back slightly from a hug. \u201cI very much appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, you owe me a gigantic favor now so it was worth it,\u201d John teased. \u201cIt was fun; we had a pretty good time, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p> Suddenly Henry jumped up and ran over, tugging on John\u2019s sleeve. Crouching down, John asked, \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry hesitated, playing with the fabric of John\u2019s sleeve. He stepped closer so that there were about six inches between his face and John\u2019s. \u201cThank you. We had fun,\u201d he said in just about the quietest voice imaginable. Then he grinned and ran back to his candy hoard as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p>\n<p> John stood, looking at Sherlock who wore an expression of utter shock. A wide smile spread across John\u2019s face. \u201cWell. That was...that was amazing,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p> \u201cI - it seems you\u2019re a very unique individual, John Watson,\u201d Sherlock murmured as he pulled John close. </p>\n<p> \u201cNah, I\u2019m just really excellent at candy-collecting. Bet you didn\u2019t know that was the trick all these years, did you?\u201d John grinned, leaning into Sherlock with his shoulder.</p>\n<p> \u201cMm, you\u2019re right. The books never said anything about that,\u201d Sherlock replied with a small smile. </p>\n<p> They both watched Henry sort enthusiastically through his candy, thrilled at the progress he had made.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2: Since people don't appear to be reading the author's notes, I'll repeat it here: I am fully aware that Thanksgiving is not celebrated in the UK. This is a US AU story, hence the US holiday of Thanksgiving.\nOver the next several weeks, John and Sherlock spent a large amount of their free time with each other, often with Henry as well. They fell into a comfortable routine around one another, and John began to find it hard to imagine his life without Sherlock and Henry in it. That was a somewhat unsettling prospect, as he and Sherlock hadn\u2019t been together that long and it seemed risky to be this involved so soon. John had never been one to shy away from risks, though, so he didn\u2019t dwell on it long.</p>\n<p> John sometimes felt like he marked the passing of time in holidays rather than months or weeks. In school the students were continually looking forward to the next holiday, and \u201chow many days until Halloween?\u201d became \u201chow many days until Thanksgiving?\u201d before he knew it.</p>\n<p> Thanksgiving had always been a messy, uncomfortable day in John\u2019s family. They celebrated because that\u2019s just what people did, but his family had a hard enough time sitting through a meal themselves let alone a meal with relatives. There were always fights, and John never understood why they continued to do it year after year. Once he was an adult, he opted out of family holiday celebrations. </p>\n<p> This year he was a little nervous because he suspected he might be invited to 221B for Thanksgiving, but wasn\u2019t certain since spending holidays together seemed like a fairly large step in a relationship. Should he politely decline so as not to intrude? And if he did go, would it just turn into another nightmare dinner? Hopefully not, but it was hard to shake eighteen years of bad experience.</p>\n<p> The kids had created a small storm of coats, hats and boots as they got ready to go out for recess and were attempting to form a line. John roused himself from his thoughts and began to create order.</p>\n<p> \u201cTyler, you don\u2019t get your spot back once you get out of line,\u201d John said to a boy who was trying to shove his way back in line. Tyler grumbled and dejectedly trudged to the end of the line, arms crossed over his chest.</p>\n<p> Though it took the kids ages to get their gear on, it took about ten seconds for them to leave the classroom and dash out to the playground. John shut the door behind him and zipped up his coat. When he turned to follow the stampede to the playground, he noticed that Henry had hung back.</p>\n<p> \u201cEverything okay, Henry?\u201d John asked.</p>\n<p> Henry stepped closer and tugged on the hem of John\u2019s coat, so John crouched down beside him so they could be eye-to-eye. John prepared for a guessing game of invented sign language, as most communication with Henry went. He hadn\u2019t spoken to John since Halloween, but John had figured he\u2019d do it again when he was ready.</p>\n<p> Henry stepped closer and into John\u2019s personal space, which he was more than used to as most Kindergartners did not understand the concept of personal space.</p>\n<p> In a voice just loud enough to be heard over the shouts on the playground, Henry asked, \u201cCan you come over for Thanksgiving? Daddy said I can help this year,\u201d he added proudly. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh,\u201d John said in surprise, both at the request and that Henry was speaking to him in a fairly public place. \u201cUm, well we\u2019d have to ask your dad if it would be okay,\u201d he said with a smile.</p>\n<p> Henry rolled his eyes in a near-perfect imitation of his father. \u201c\u2018Course he wants you to come over. Sometimes he even talks to you, <i>even when you\u2019re not there,</i>\u201d Henry said conspiratorially. </p>\n<p> Again, John was surprised - both by the fact that Henry had been speaking to him for this long, and that Sherlock, apparently, missed him when he wasn\u2019t there. He grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll just double check with him to be safe, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d agreed Henry with a serious nod, then promptly took off for the swing set.</p>\n<p> A warm, pleasant sensation spread through John\u2019s chest as he headed closer to the playground. Obviously he was aware that Sherlock liked him, but now he had a clue as to the extent. He wondered what Sherlock told him when he wasn\u2019t there, and he imagined that Sherlock would not be entirely pleased to learn that particular secret was out. John heard a lot of things from students that parents most likely did not want them sharing, and he had to admit it was pretty amusing.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When John got home from work he retrieved his phone and sprawled out on the couch to send a text to Sherlock. </p>\n<p>I found something out today. JW</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have to be more specific. And interesting. SH</p>\n<p>Oh, I think you\u2019ll find it interesting. JW</p>\n<p>Go on. SH</p>\n<p>Someone told me that you talk to me when I\u2019m not there. JW</p>\n<p>Henry spoke to you again? SH</p>\n<p>Just briefly, out at recess. JW</p>\n<p>Interesting. That\u2019s excellent. What else did he say? SH</p>\n<p>He asked if I could come over for Thanksgiving. I told him we\u2019d have to ask you first. JW</p>\n<p>Well why wouldn\u2019t you? SH</p>\n<p>Well, you know, it\u2019s sort of a family holiday and all that. JW</p>\n<p>Henry wants you there. Of course you can come. SH</p>\n<p>And what about you? JW</p>\n<p>Oh, I suppose some company would be nice. SH</p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll show you how nice it would be after Henry goes to bed. JW</p>\n<p>John Watson, that is highly inappropriate. SH</p>\n<p>And since when are you concerned with being appropriate? JW</p>\n<p>Point taken. Mrs. Hudson will be there for dinner as well, and Mycroft will probably stop by if he can fit through the doorway. SH</p>\n<p>Ah, brotherly love. So touching. JW</p>\n<p>You haven\u2019t known him long enough to understand. SH</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure. Although he did try to kidnap me. JW</p>\n<p>See? There you have it. SH</p>\n<p>Henry said you\u2019re letting him help with dinner this year. JW</p>\n<p>Last year I told him he could help this year and thought he would forget. He obviously has not. SH</p>\n<p>You could always let him help with pie. Pumpkin\u2019s easy to do. JW</p>\n<p>I suppose. SH</p>\n<p>I could come over early and help, if you want. JW</p>\n<p>I\u2019m certain Henry would enjoy that. 4 pm, then? SH</p>\n<p>Sounds good. We\u2019re still on for this Friday, right? JW</p>\n<p>Of course. SH</p>\n<p>Great, see you then. JW</p>\n<p>It was Thanksgiving, and Sherlock was nervous. Once again he had attempted to clean the apartment, but quickly gave up as it was in a continual state of clutter and to be honest, he <i>liked</i> it that way. Thankfully Mrs. Hudson did stop by and tidy up the worst of it, saying with a wink that she would be back in time for dinner and no earlier. Sherlock rolled his eyes at that, which he always did whenever she commented on his relationship with John. It was all in good nature; he knew she was pleased for him, and she knew he was equally pleased about the situation - if not more so.</p>\n<p> Sherlock was currently stretched out on the couch, plucking an aimless tune on his violin while Henry played upstairs in his room. He had gone through another superhero phase around Halloween, but was now back on space pirates. Sherlock would not be surprised to go up to his room and find that Henry\u2019s bed had once again been divested of sheets and blankets to be transformed into some sort of space pirate ship. Sherlock couldn\u2019t really see the design, but Henry always seemed pleased with it.</p>\n<p> The main reason Sherlock was nervous was not really because of the state of the apartment, but because he was given to understand that spending the holidays with one\u2019s significant other was a big deal. John hadn\u2019t told him specifically, but it wasn\u2019t hard to deduce that holidays in his family had never been particularly pleasant. Because of that, Sherlock wanted this Thanksgiving to be as near to perfect as he could make it. It wasn\u2019t entirely selfless, though. A strongly possessive side of Sherlock wanted John to like holidays with him the best because then he wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere but with Sherlock. He was aware that this was perhaps not good, but he also knew he had a very addictive personality and with him it was everything or nothing. And he wanted everything. All of John.</p>\n<p> He carefully hid these feelings as it was still early on in the relationship, and it terrified him to think that John might not want to give all of himself to Sherlock. If he didn\u2019t reveal his desires, John could not reject them. It was as simple as that.</p>\n<p> The turkey was in the oven, and all that was left to do for the moment was wait for John to arrive. Whatever Mrs. Hudson said, cooking was not a mystery to Sherlock. It was a science, and science was second nature to him. It was just that he rarely had occasion to cook fancy meals as both he and Henry were picky eaters.</p>\n<p> A rambunctious clatter came from the stairs as Henry appeared in the living room, still wearing an eyepatch over one eye. </p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hard for me to see with this on,\u201d he complained as he made his way over to the couch.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell then take it off,\u201d Sherlock suggested practically while he was forced to make room on the couch for his son.</p>\n<p> Henry managed to look offended as he squeezed in between the back of the couch and Sherlock. \u201cI can\u2019t take it <i>off</i>,\u201d he said in a scandalized tone. \u201cI won\u2019t be a space pirate if I take it <i>off</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell,\u201d Sherlock mused as he set his violin out of harm\u2019s way, \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain space pirates do not attend Thanksgiving dinners.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry thought about this seriously, head resting on Sherlock\u2019s shoulder as he played with a button on Sherlock\u2019s shirt. \u201cWell...then maybe I can be a space pirate after Thanksgiving,\u201d he conceded, pushing the eyepatch off his face and setting it on Sherlock\u2019s stomach. </p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cGood idea. And you\u2019re supposed to help with the pie later, and I don\u2019t think pirates are very good at making pies.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cProb\u2019ly not,\u201d Henry replied seriously. \u201cThey prob\u2019ly just want to shoot it or hide treasure in it, and then we can\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd then Mr. Watson would be most disappointed if he found out the pie had been all shot to pieces,\u201d Sherlock added with a smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\u201d Henry giggled. \u201cSo no pirate pie.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo pirate pie,\u201d Sherlock agreed.</p>\n<p> They were both quiet for a moment, lying on the couch in comfortable silence. Which, of course, did not last very long with a five-year-old in residence.</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you love Mr. Watson?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock was taken aback by the question. After Sherlock had explained that he and John were dating and part of dating meant becoming friends, Henry had seemed to accept it and continue on with no further questions.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat gives you that idea?\u201d Sherlock asked carefully.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell because Grace says that if you have a boyfriend then you\u2019re in love,\u201d Henry said, as if it was the most obvious fact in the world.</p>\n<p> That gave Sherlock pause as well. He and John had never actually put a label on their relationship, but he supposed that yes, John was his boyfriend. But did he love him? Was it too soon to tell?</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, having a boyfriend or girlfriend doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re in love,\u201d Sherlock began.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat\u2019s nessressarily?\u201d Henry interrupted.</p>\n<p> Sherlock rephrased. \u201cHaving a boyfriend doesn\u2019t mean you have to be in love. You might like each other very much, or you might just be getting to know one another.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBut you know Mr. Watson and you like him too \u2018cause even though you <i>promised</i> I saw you <i>kissing</i> him when he went home last time!\u201d Henry accused triumphantly.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell...you shouldn\u2019t have been spying,\u201d was all Sherlock could come up with. \u201cAnd technically I didn\u2019t actually promise I wouldn\u2019t kiss him. But I\u2019ll try to make sure you never have to see it ever again,\u201d he said with a smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood,\u201d Henry replied, apparently satisfied with the compromise. \u201cSo does Mr. Watson love you?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock was quiet for a moment. \u201cI...we haven\u2019t really talked about it, so I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d Henry replied, seemingly satisfied with the answer. Sherlock wondered if that would actually be the end of it.</p>\n<p> \u201cTell me a story,\u201d Henry demanded.</p>\n<p> \u201cTell me a story, <i>please</i>,\u201d Sherlock corrected.</p>\n<p> \u201cTell me a story, <i>please</i>,\u201d Henry replied, mimicking Sherlock\u2019s tone.</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right. Made-up, or real?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMade up,\u201d came the decisive reply as Henry snuggled into Sherlock\u2019s side.</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay. This happened a long time ago, so things were much different than they are now...\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John smiled as Mrs. Hudson opened the door and greeted him. </p>\n<p> \u201cHello, dear! I wasn\u2019t expecting you so soon. Is everything all right?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, everything\u2019s just fine. I came a little early to help out. Happy Thanksgiving, by the way,\u201d John replied as he entered the building.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell isn\u2019t that thoughtful of you!\u201d Mrs. Hudson said cheerily. \u201cThey\u2019re both up there, go on. I\u2019ll see you in a bit!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThanks,\u201d John replied with a smile, then headed up the stairs. He walked into the apartment to find Sherlock and Henry on the couch together as Sherlock told a story, animating the words with one hand. John thought he might either melt or burst with affection for Sherlock right then, but before he could do either Sherlock noticed he was there.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello, Jo - <i>ugh</i>.\u201d Sherlock\u2019s greeting was cut off by Henry\u2019s mad scramble over his father to get to John, whom he hugged tightly around the waist. Had John not been well-balanced at the moment, he might have been knocked over by the force of it. This was interesting to him as Henry didn\u2019t show the same amount of affection at school as he did privately. John didn\u2019t know whether this was an instinctive behavior, or if Sherlock had talked to him about it.</p>\n<p> \u201cHi Henry. Good to see you, too,\u201d John laughed as he wrapped an arm around the boy\u2019s shoulders. In his other hand was a bottle of wine, which he held out to Sherlock.</p>\n<p> \u201cI know you told me not to bring anything, but I couldn\u2019t just show up empty-handed,\u201d he smiled apologetically. </p>\n<p> Sherlock accepted the bottle and put it in the fridge to chill. When he came back, he said, \u201cAh, I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I believe Lestrade is coming to dinner as well.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind,\u201d John said with a roll of his eyes. He would have continued, but Henry grabbed him by the hand and pulled him into the kitchen, which smelled heavenly. On the counter were ingredients to make pumpkin pie. </p>\n<p> \u201cAre you in charge of the pie?\u201d he asked Henry.</p>\n<p> Henry nodded proudly.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd would you like me to help?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry nodded again, this time a little more shyly.</p>\n<p> \u201cJohn, you don\u2019t have to -\u201d Sherlock interrupted, but John cut him off with a look.</p>\n<p> \u201cI came early to help, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019d be happy to,\u201d he replied.</p>\n<p> Henry grinned and got out every single measuring cup and spoon from the drawer to his right.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> The pie was baking in the oven and everything else was prepared and set on the table when the guests began to arrive. First was Mrs. Hudson, of course, who had insisted on bringing homemade rolls that, in John\u2019s opinion, looked absolutely delicious. Mycroft and Lestrade arrived simultaneously, both looking a little flustered and glad of a distraction as they entered the apartment. </p>\n<p> \u201cUncle Mycroft!\u201d Henry shouted, abandoning his Legos to envelop his uncle in a tackle-hug. \u201cHi Mr. Greg,\u201d he added, having recently decided he could call Greg by his first name if he added \u2018mister\u2019 in front of it. Greg didn\u2019t mind in the least.</p>\n<p> Henry stepped back and narrowed his eyes, observing them in a manner reminiscent of his father. \u201cDid you guys come to Thanksgiving together?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Mycroft replied quickly. A little too quickly, Lestrade thought as he gave Mycroft a sidelong glance. \u201cWe merely arrived at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHmm. Okay,\u201d Henry said suspiciously. \u201cHurry up so we can eat dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, that\u2019s not polite,\u201d Sherlock called from where he was pouring drinks.</p>\n<p> \u201cBut I\u2019m hungryyy,\u201d Henry complained.</p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019ll eat soon,\u201d Sherlock promised. Henry did not appear entirely pleased with this answer.</p>\n<p> Mycroft pulled a small book from his jacket and handed it to Henry. \u201cI believe I promised you this a while ago,\u201d he said with a smile. </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes widened as he reverently accepted the book. It was a book about how to take care of a pet rabbit. \u201cThanks, Uncle Mycroft,\u201d he said, gaze still trained on the book. Entirely forgetting about dinner, he went to the living room to peruse his new treasure.</p>\n<p> When Mycroft looked back up, he found Lestrade watching him. Noticing he had been caught, the detective averted his gaze and walked briskly over to Mrs. Hudson and began chatting with her. Hm. Mycroft would have to file that away to be examined later.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhy must you make my life difficult?\u201d Sherlock complained, suddenly appearing at Mycroft\u2019s side.</p>\n<p> \u201cI am simply encouraging his interests,\u201d Mycroft replied smoothly.</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course you are,\u201d Sherlock retorted sarcastically.</p>\n<p> \u201cSpeaking of interests, how are you and Mr. Watson getting along? Quite well, I take it?\u201d Mycroft asked smugly.</p>\n<p> \u201cThat is none of your business,\u201d Sherlock huffed, and stalked back to the kitchen without another word. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Dinner was delicious and probably the best family event John had ever attended. There was lots of talk and laughter instead of shouting and arguments. Mycroft and Sherlock did snipe at each other, but Greg and John acted as good buffers. To John\u2019s surprise, Mrs. Hudson got in on it, too. She appeared to be a sweet old lady, but she could really hold her own. It was also interesting to John that Henry was very talkative. Though he did speak to John now, he still didn\u2019t talk much around him. Around this table, however, was everyone in the world that Henry spoke to, and perhaps that bolstered his courage. </p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy,\u201d Henry said suddenly, his voice cutting through the din. \u201cDid you know that Uncle Mycroft and Mr. Greg came here together?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock narrowed his eyes, studying the two men in question. Mycroft looked as cool and composed as ever. Greg\u2019s reaction gave much more away. \u201cMm, I\u2019m afraid they didn\u2019t. Just arrived at the same time,\u201d Sherlock corrected. Then, with a somewhat predatory grin, he added, \u201cThough I believe at least one party would have liked to arrive together, if not both.\u201d</p>\n<p> John giggled at that pronouncement, then clapped a hand over his mouth as the dining room had gone suddenly quiet. Greg\u2019s cheeks were flushed and Mycroft looked slightly uncomfortable.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh now Sherlock, stop teasing your brother,\u201d Mrs. Hudson admonished. \u201cEven if they would make a lovely couple, you shouldn\u2019t interfere,\u201d she added with a smile and a twinkle in her eye.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell he interfered first,\u201d Sherlock grumbled. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh <i>really</i>?\u201d Mrs. Hudson asked with interest. \u201cWell Mycroft dear, I\u2019m afraid all\u2019s fair in love and war!\u201d</p>\n<p> Most of this had gone over Henry\u2019s head, and he was getting bored. \u201cMr. Watson,\u201d he said, interrupting the conversation. </p>\n<p> John looked up in surprise. Henry had not spoken to him that loudly or clearly before. \u201cYeah?\u201d he asked, forgetting momentarily about the roll in his hand.</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you love my daddy?\u201d</p>\n<p> The whole table fell silent once again as John\u2019s brain tried to process the question. He could feel his cheeks growing red as he stammered, \u201cI, ah...well, we haven\u2019t exactly, um...\u201d he trailed off. Now this seemed much more like a family dinner - embarrassment and all.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe does,\u201d Mycroft cut in, a small, smug smile on his face. Sherlock glared daggers at him. John stared at his roll.</p>\n<p> \u201cIf he does, great. If he doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Greg reprimanded Mycroft. Mycroft, in turn, looked surprised then somehow approving. John smiled thankfully at Greg.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd I love him as well, so can we please move on?\u201d Sherlock said, gaining shocked looks from everyone but Henry. </p>\n<p> John had imagined once or twice what it might be like when he and Sherlock talked about this subject, and it had never turned out like this - outed at Thanksgiving dinner, when neither of them had even discussed it yet. Despite that fact, John was surprisingly okay with it. He smiled warmly at Sherlock, then continued eating his roll as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p>\n<p> Conversation soon picked up again, and before John knew it dinner was finished, cleaned up, and everyone was headed home. Henry was fast asleep on the couch, so John offered to take him up to bed. As he tucked the boy in, Henry opened his eyes sleepily and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you love my daddy,\u201d before drifting off again. John smiled, kissed his forehead, and went back downstairs.</p>\n<p> Sherlock was on the couch, fiddling with his violin. John sat down next to him, and asked casually, \u201cSo, you love me, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock stiffened, then set the violin aside. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems I do. But you love me too,\u201d he added almost accusatorially. </p>\n<p> John chuckled. \u201cIt seems I do,\u201d he said quietly, then leaned over and kissed Sherlock softly. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure having your brother tell you for me would have been my first choice.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNot mine either,\u201d Sherlock said with a soft laugh, then kissed John. John hummed in approval as Sherlock pressed kisses to his jaw and neck.</p>\n<p> \u201cBedroom?\u201d Sherlock asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cBedroom,\u201d John agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone knows about us,\u201d John said suddenly and quietly into the dark as he lay next to Sherlock.</p>\n<p> Sherlock huffed and buried his nose in John\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve been keeping our relationship a secret,\u201d he murmured against John\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p> \u201cI know,\u201d John replied. \u201cI mean...well, someone left a less-than-supportive comment on my last blog post about it. The post wasn\u2019t even about relationships, and I\u2019ve never written about us.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock shrugged as best as one could while lying down. \u201cThere are bound to be people who are openly against gay relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p> John sighed. \u201cI think you should just read it.\u201d He grabbed his phone off the nightstand and opened the email with the comment. It was, of course, from an unknown sender.</p>\n<p> <i>Anonymous<br>\nMy, my Johnny. You\u2019ve been up to more than you\u2019re letting on about, haven\u2019t you? Got yourself a new \u2018friend\u2019? You should be careful. Kids are very impressionable, wouldn\u2019t want any to get the wrong idea about your friend and his little boy now, would we?</i></p>\n<p> Sherlock scanned the comment, frowning as he did so. \u201cWho exactly is he threatening?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d John asked. \u201cHe\u2019s threatening someone, and he\u2019s mentioned Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you think he\u2019s serious?\u201d Sherlock mused. \u201cJust because an anonymous threat\u2019s been made doesn\u2019t mean anything will come of it.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to take that chance?\u201d John asked quietly.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative? End our relationship because a nameless entity on the internet may have threatened one of us?\u201d Sherlock asked, handing the phone back to John.</p>\n<p> Setting it on the nightstand, John rolled over to face Sherlock. \u201cI don\u2019t want that. I guess...let\u2019s just be careful, and see if anything comes of it. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMm,\u201d Sherlock assented, and wrapped his arms around John to hold him close.<br>\n***</p>\n<p> The next day at work John felt like he was constantly on edge, waiting for something to happen. Nothing did. Once the dismissal bell rang at the end of the day and all his students had gone, he sighed in relief. Maybe Sherlock was right and he was just overreacting to an inane comment trying to cause drama for drama\u2019s sake. </p>\n<p> Just to be safe, though, that night he made a blog post saying he was going on hiatus. There was no need to attract any more unwanted attention. </p>\n<p> <i>Short Hiatus<br>\nI\u2019m taking a break from the blog for a bit. Nothing to worry about! Just need to focus on work - assessments take forever in Kindergarten. I\u2019ll probably be back around Christmas break, hopefully with a few tips for the next round of assessments. Thanks for being patient, and keep an eye out for new posts towards the end of the year!</i></p>\n<p> Before bed, he checked the comments on his latest post. There were lots of well-wishers and \u2018we\u2019ll miss you!\u2019s until he had scrolled to the end of the page. His heart sank when he read the text.</p>\n<p> <i>Anonymous<br>\nGiving up so soon, Johnny? I thought we might have had a little more fun. Guess we\u2019ll have to find a different way to play, won\u2019t we? Maybe I can get your \u2018friend\u2019 interested. He\u2019s like me; we like games and puzzles. I do wonder what he sees in you. Anyway, talk to you later~ </i></p>\n<p> Underneath that was a concerned comment from Molly, Sherlock\u2019s colleague at the morgue. She was very sweet and did her best to accommodate Sherlock\u2019s ridiculous demands. Henry didn\u2019t speak to her, but it was clear that he liked her very much. </p>\n<p> <i>Molly H<br>\nJohn, is everything all right? Who is that^? They don\u2019t seem very nice. Let me know if I can help! &lt;3 </i></p>\n<p> John sighed and rubbed his hands over his face. Clearly ignoring whoever this was hadn\u2019t worked, which made John wonder if this was more than just a prank. He got out his phone and slowly typed a message.</p>\n<p>I got another comment from that same anonymous person on the blog. JW</p>\n<p>I told you that blog is a waste of time. SH</p>\n<p>Sherlock, this isn\u2019t a time to be joking. I think he\u2019s serious. JW</p>\n<p>Or she. But probably he. He\u2019s just trying to rile you up by making that comment about my choice in partners. SH</p>\n<p>Maybe. I still think this is more than a bored person looking for trouble. JW</p>\n<p>All that\u2019s happened so far are a few mildly creepy comments. You worry too much, John. SH</p>\n<p>Okay, fine. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow. JW</p>\n<p>Goodnight. SH</p>\n<p> John crawled into bed, suddenly feeling much more exhausted than he had fifteen minutes ago. </p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When Grace ran up to John at recess with the look of the concerned, determined helper, John knew someone was crying somewhere. It happened at least once every recess; a child would fall or get pushed and begin crying, then one or two kids would come running to tell John as if it was their sworn duty to report any injured person on the playground. Generally the crying students were crying more out of surprise than actual injury, so John wan\u2019t too worried.</p>\n<p> His heart leaped into his throat when he realized it was Henry who was crying. He had seen Henry cry at school only once. John said thank you to the kids who were crowded around and told them to go play. He knelt down next to Henry and put an arm around his shoulders, but Henry jerked away. Grace hovered nearby, waiting to assist need be.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, are you okay? Did you get hurt?\u201d John asked the crying boy, worry creasing his features.</p>\n<p> Henry sniffed and shook his head, looking down at his hands. There was a crumpled piece of paper clutched in the left.</p>\n<p> \u201cCan I see?\u201d John asked, tugging gently at the paper. Henry let it go without a fight.</p>\n<p> John felt sick as he read the text. It wasn\u2019t handwritten, so there wouldn\u2019t be an easy way to trace it back to the writer. It said,</p>\n<p> <i>you are not safe you are not safe you are not safe you are not safe<br>\nit is mr watson\u2019s fault</i></p>\n<p> John knew Henry had read and understood all of it as he was at a very high reading level, which would explain why he didn\u2019t want to be near John. He pulled out his phone with shaking hands and called Sherlock.</p>\n<p> \u201cJohn?\u201d came the slightly confused voice on the other end.</p>\n<p> \u201cSherlock,\u201d John said tightly. \u201cYou need to come pick Henry up from school.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sherlock asked immediately.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry - he\u2019s been threatened. He\u2019s okay, but you need to take him home,\u201d John said quietly, trying to even out his voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cThreatened how?\u201d Sherlock asked in a dangerously cool tone.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe - he got a note. I didn\u2019t see who gave it to him, and he won\u2019t talk to me or even look at me. Because -\u201d John choked up, then took a deep breath so he could continue. \u201cThe note repeats \u2018you are not safe\u2019 and then says \u2018it is Mr. Watson\u2019s fault.\u2019 It\u2019s the same commenter on my blog, Sherlock. It has to be.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d Sherlock replied, then hung up.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry, your dad will be here soon to pick you up,\u201d John said in as friendly a tone as he could manage.</p>\n<p> Henry did not respond.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John stopped by Sherlock\u2019s apartment later than night with a heavy heart. There was only one way to keep Henry safe, and John was not looking forward to it. By the look on Sherlock\u2019s face as he let John in, he knew what John was there for as well.</p>\n<p> \u201cSherlock -\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cI know, John,\u201d Sherlock said quietly, pain evident in his voice.</p>\n<p> \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d John said plaintively, as if he were a child hoping for an easy way out.</p>\n<p> \u201cNeither do I,\u201d Sherlock said, enfolding him in a hug. \u201cBut...perhaps it only needs to be for a short while. Until I find whoever is doing this and make sure they never do it again,\u201d he added coldly.</p>\n<p> John nodded into his shoulder. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said in a whisper. Pulling away from the hug, he straightened himself out and a blank mask settled over his features. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you later, then.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMaybe,\u201d was all Sherlock could reply as he watched John limp out the door.</p>\n<p>The next week was miserable for John. He thought it would get better after a few days - and logically, it should have. There was no confusion about the breakup; it had to be done in order to protect Henry. Still, the heart wasn\u2019t logical and John was glad it was almost the weekend. He couldn\u2019t mope about at work; the kids would be sure to notice and it would affect their learning. </p>\n<p> As he got guided reading lessons ready for next week while the kids were at free choice centers, Henry approached his desk. John looked up in surprise and asked, \u201cWhat do you need, Henry?\u201d</p>\n<p> Ever since the breakup, Henry had been disinclined to talk to John. He probably thought this was all John\u2019s fault, especially after receiving that note at recess. John couldn\u2019t blame him.</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy\u2019s sad,\u201d he said quietly after a lengthy pause. \u201cHe still talks to you even though you don\u2019t come over any more, and he was crying. I heard him in his room.\u201d </p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes were wide with uncertainty and fright. John knew that sensation well. His father had not been a nice man, and John had listened to his mother cry more times than he cared to count. It was terrifying when your parent was crying and you were too young to know how to help.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Henry,\u201d John said, his voice rougher than he would have liked. \u201cI can\u2019t come over any more. It\u2019s to keep you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBut if Daddy catches the bad guy, then you could come to my house,\u201d Henry said hopefully.</p>\n<p> John smiled sadly. \u201cYes, but we shouldn\u2019t get our hopes up. Even though your dad is very smart, he might not be able to catch this one.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry sighed and nodded, as if he bore the weight of the world on his young shoulders. \u201cOkay, Mr. Watson. But I can still see you at school and Lego club, so that\u2019s good,\u201d he added. John appreciated that in Henry; he could always find a positive.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, you can. Now can you go help your friends pack up the drawing supplies? It\u2019s time to clean up,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and did as he was told while John told the class that centers were over and it was time to clean up so they could pack up to go home.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> After the kids had all been picked up, John was tidying things in the room when he saw a drawing on his desk that hadn\u2019t been there before. It was a picture of Sherlock, Henry, and John all holding hands and smiling while a man, presumably Lestrade, put a man with a mad face in jail. The picture said, \u201cTo: Mr. Watson\u201d on the top, and on the bottom it read, \u201cLove, Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p> It broke John\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John had taken to lying on the couch and numbly watching TV for hours after he came home from work until it was time to go to bed. He was doing just that when his phone started ringing. It was tempting to ignore it, but John reached over and picked it up off the floor in case it was something about work.</p>\n<p> The screen displayed Sherlock\u2019s number.</p>\n<p> Feeling as though his heart was trying to make an exit via his throat, John answered. \u201cHello?\u201d he said, because the easy camaraderie between them was gone. All that was left was longing, awkwardness, and broken hearts.</p>\n<p> \u201cJohn,\u201d Sherlock said urgently. \u201cI need you to come over.\u201d</p>\n<p> John felt like he wanted to cry. This wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cSherlock, we can\u2019t. I thought we agreed on this. If -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>John</i>,\u201d Sherlock cut him off. \u201cI need you to watch Henry. I have a case - it\u2019s crucial that I leave now or I\u2019ll miss perhaps my only opportunity and there\u2019s no one else to watch him.\u201d</p>\n<p> John clenched the phone tightly in his hand. Was Sherlock insane, heartless, or both? They broke up for Henry\u2019s safety, and now Sherlock wanted John to watch him? It didn\u2019t make sense. It was also cruel to ask John to spend time in Sherlock\u2019s home where it would be near impossible not to think about him.</p>\n<p> \u201cPlease, John,\u201d came Sherlock\u2019s voice when John didn\u2019t answer, a little softer this time.</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d John said quietly. \u201cJust this once.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThank you. I need you here as soon as possible,\u201d Sherlock instructed, then the line went dead.</p>\n<p> Taking only a moment to make himself presentable, John grabbed a book and his coat and headed out the door.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Mrs. Hudson answered the door looking as if she was just about to leave, and once she saw that it was John who had knocked her face creased in a delighted smile. \u201cOh, John! I\u2019m so glad you and Sherlock are seeing one another again. He\u2019s been dreadfully lonely ever since - well, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m just here to watch Henry,\u201d John said with a tight smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d Mrs. Hudson replied, trying unsuccessfully to mask her disappointment. \u201cSherlock asked me to watch him, but I have a meeting that I just can\u2019t miss,\u201d she explained.</p>\n<p> John nodded, wondering briefly what sort of important meetings Mrs. Hudson went to. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I had nothing to do, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p> Mrs. Hudson patted his arm sympathetically. \u201cI hope you two can work it out. It\u2019s not often you find someone so suited for you - especially in Sherlock\u2019s case. Well, I have to go or I\u2019ll be late. Good luck, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBye, Mrs. Hudson,\u201d John said, then began the trek up the stairs to 221B. It would take a lot more than luck to fix their problem.</p>\n<p> John narrowly avoided being run down by Sherlock at the top of the stairs. \u201cHenry\u2019s already had dinner,\u201d Sherlock quickly informed. \u201cAnd you know all the rest. He\u2019ll need a bath tonight,\u201d Sherlock added, and at least had the decency to look apologetic. \u201cIf there was anyone else -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, I know,\u201d John said shortly. \u201cYou\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock looked at him with an unreadable expression, then nodded before trotting down the stairs and rushing out the door.</p>\n<p> \u201cHi, Henry,\u201d John said as he entered the apartment uneasily. This place felt more like home than his own did, which made it all the more painful to be here. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re sad, too,\u201d Henry declared.</p>\n<p> \u201cThat obvious, huh?\u201d John asked with a weary smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cDaddy teached me how to tell if people are sad,\u201d he replied proudly.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe taught you,\u201d John corrected. \u201cAnd of course he did. He\u2019s a very smart man.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and continued doodling in his notebook. He seemed slightly unsure of John\u2019s presence, but also glad to have him there which John was grateful for.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d John asked as he took off his coat and walked over to sit down next to Henry.</p>\n<p> \u201cA house for my bunny,\u201d Henry explained. \u201cI\u2019m gonna show Daddy that I know how to be insponsible for one. Wait,\u201d he said, screwing up his face in confusion. \u201cRepossible. No. What\u2019s that word?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cResponsible?\u201d John ventured.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah! Responsible. Daddy said I can\u2019t have a bunny until I\u2019m responsible enough. So here it is!\u201d</p>\n<p> John listened with interest as Henry explained each part of the picture to him. It was a nice distraction from every little thing in the apartment that screamed \u2018Sherlock\u2019 to him.</p>\n<p> \u201cHow about we build a little model of it? That would really impress your dad,\u201d John suggested. \u201cDo you have any craft supplies?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry leapt to his feet and opened a low cabinet that was overflowing with just about every craft item available, and John smiled. As a kid he had been quite clever with his hands and spent time building all sorts of models. They didn\u2019t have any instructions, but he was sure it wouldn\u2019t be that difficult to build a model \u2018bunny house.\u2019 </p>\n<p> Time flew by as they worked together, and when they were finished John thought they had built a very respectable bunny house. Henry had made other props such as a food bowl, water dish, and hay rack and got a small stuffed bunny from his room to act in place of a real one. Henry rubbed his eyes sleepily, but beamed proudly at their creation. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s really good!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cDaddy with have to let me have a bunny now.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell I don\u2019t know about all that, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be impressed,\u201d John replied. \u201cReady for your bath?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry nodded and dashed off to the bathroom, because what was bath time but another opportunity to play? By the time John got there, Henry was filling the tub and had unloaded many toys into the shallow water. Quickly divesting himself of his clothes, Henry hopped in and lost no time in setting up a boats versus ducks and dinosaurs battle.</p>\n<p> John hovered awkwardly; he\u2019d never had to bathe anyone\u2019s child before. Should he stay and keep an eye on Henry? The boy was five, though. Surely he wouldn\u2019t drown in the bathtub.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou need to wash my hair \u2018cause I can\u2019t do it \u2018cause soap gets in my eyes,\u201d Henry announced.</p>\n<p> Well, that solved that problem. John gently washed his hair, making sure to keep soap far away from his eyes. Then he left the bathroom for a while to let Henry play, wandering around the apartment and tidying up here and there. When he was sure the bathwater could no longer be warm, he bundled Henry into a towel and with a slight struggle, into pajamas.</p>\n<p> Henry was burrowed under the blankets in his bed and looking quite cozy when John turned to leave.</p>\n<p> \u201cWait!\u201d Henry called urgently. \u201cYou didn\u2019t read me a story yet!\u201d</p>\n<p> Ah, of course. How could he have forgotten about a bedtime story? John picked up the book that was sitting on Henry\u2019s nightstand and sat on the edge of his bed. Henry wiggled over so that he was leaning against John.</p>\n<p> \u201cRedwall?\u201d John asked, not having heard of it before.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes,\u201d Henry replied. \u201cDaddy said it has a <i>hare</i> in it. That\u2019s like a big bunny,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019re on chapter seven. There\u2019s a bookmark!\u201d he added, pointing to the paper sticking out of the book.</p>\n<p> John read until Henry\u2019s eyes drooped and didn\u2019t snap back open. Easing himself out of Henry\u2019s grasp, John set the book on the nightstand and made to sneak out of the room.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou forgot my g\u2019night kiss,\u201d Henry mumbled sleepily from his cocoon of blankets.</p>\n<p> John hesitated, then walked back to Henry\u2019s side to smooth the curls off his forehead and press a kiss to his forehead. \u201cGoodnight, Henry.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c\u2018night,\u201d Henry replied as he drifted off to sleep.</p>\n<p> John stood outside Henry\u2019s door for a moment, trying to will his heart to stop paining him with every beat. It was this quiet pause that enabled him to hear a noise from downstairs that sounded distinctly like footsteps. On high alert, John moved as quietly as he could down the stairs. He made it about two feet away from the last stair when he felt a sharp sting in his neck. He turned immediately to find his attacker dressed in all black, wearing a mask to conceal any identifying features. John struck without hesitation, his body remembering years of training. A solid punch to the diaphragm bent the man in half and an elbow to the back of the neck had him on the floor. John was on him immediately, and a swift punch to the jaw had the man out cold. Wincing at the pain of bone-on-bone, John shook his hand and stood up. </p>\n<p> As he stepped away from the man to see if anyone else was in the flat, he stumbled. His limbs felt heavy and uncoordinated. Remembering the stinging sensation on his neck, he looked around and spotted a syringe several feet away on the floor; his assailant must have dropped it when John attacked. A wave of panic washed over him; what had he been injected with? Henry was still upstairs. What if the attacker regained consciousness before he did? He would never forgive himself if Henry was harmed. John tried to cross the room to get to his phone, but his legs gave way and he landed on the floor with a hard crash before his vision faded to black.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> John was aware of a few things as he regained consciousness. Firstly, his mouth was incredibly dry. He groaned, but it came out as a raspy, croaking noise. His limbs still felt heavy and his mind sluggish, and he opened his eyes only to close them again in the glaring light. </p>\n<p> As he lay in great discomfort trying to puzzle out what the hell was going on, the events leading up to that moment came rushing back. He sat up suddenly with a hoarse cry, intent on getting to Henry\u2019s room and seeing if he was okay. Before he got anywhere, he felt a large hand against his chest, pressing him back into the couch.</p>\n<p> The couch. He had collapsed on the floor, and now he was on the couch. The blurry, bright image in front of him resolved into the concerned features of Sherlock\u2019s face.</p>\n<p> \u201cHenry\u2019s fine,\u201d Sherlock said soothingly, handing John a glass of water. </p>\n<p> John relaxed and took the water gratefully, drinking it in small sips until he felt able to speak. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI just got back minutes ago. You did quite a number on your assailant; he remains unconscious. Henry heard the noise and found you both, then called me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe should have stayed upstairs,\u201d John said instantly. \u201cThere could have been more of them.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThis isn\u2019t the army, John,\u201d Sherlock said gently. \u201cHe was a frightened child seeking comfort. Of course he came downstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p> John nodded and sipped at his water. Of course that\u2019s what a five-year-old would do; he just wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. \u201cWhy was he here? That man?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock\u2019s expression grew dark. \u201cAn attempt to kidnap you, I think. Which would have most likely ended in your demise.\u201d</p>\n<p> John rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, thanks. Very reassuring.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou asked for information, not reassurance.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI was just drugged, you know. Have some pity,\u201d John said with a small smile.</p>\n<p> Sherlock\u2019s expression softened. \u201cHe was in the employ of a man named Moriarty, who also happened to be the man at the head of the kidnapping ring as well as many more notable crimes. He was the one who left the comments on your blog and the one who gave Henry the note. Well, I can\u2019t be sure he gave Henry the note himself, but I\u2019m certain it was from him.\u201d</p>\n<p> John frowned. \u201cSo he wanted me out of the picture, obviously. Was this some sort of massively sick way of...I don\u2019t know, flirting with you?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock looked grim. \u201cHe likes to play games. Puzzles. As do I. He thought-\u201d a spasm of disgust crossed Sherlock\u2019s features \u201c-that we were suited for each other. He was delusional.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWas?\u201d John echoed.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes,\u201d Sherlock replied. \u201cThat\u2019s where I was tonight. Tracking him down.\u201d</p>\n<p> John paled. \u201cYou killed him?\u201d he asked quietly.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Sherlock replied shortly. \u201cThough I would have if the need arose. He threatened my son and separated me from you. He could not be allowed to continue to exist. He was going to be arrested, but tried to attack me and was fatally shot by Lestrade.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSuppose I\u2019ll have to thank him, then,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> Sherlock looked surprised for a moment, then chuckled. \u201cYes, I think thanks would be in order.\u201d</p>\n<p> Silence hung between them for a moment, as did the tension of unasked questions. John broke the silence first.</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you think...I mean, since he\u2019s gone, do you think we could get back together?\u201d He tried not to sound too hopeful; after all, Sherlock might still consider the situation too dangerous.</p>\n<p> Sherlock offered a small smile. \u201cIf you still want to. I know things haven\u2019t been easy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p> John nudged Sherlock\u2019s knee with his own. \u201cYou either. Henry told me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock\u2019s cheeks flushed. \u201cYes, well. I missed you,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p> \u201cI missed you, too,\u201d John replied softly, then leaned forward and pressed a gentle kiss to Sherlock\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p> \u201cI called you an ambulance,\u201d Sherlock said after they parted.</p>\n<p> \u201cWell that\u2019s not very romantic,\u201d John teased.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou were drugged. It was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just need to sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou will do no such thing. You\u2019ll go to the hospital, where we can make sure you are going to be okay. Then I will take you back here and you will sleep in my bed so that I can easily monitor your vital signs,\u201d Sherlock said adamantly.</p>\n<p> \u201cIs that so?\u201d John asked with a grin.</p>\n<p> \u201cYes,\u201d came the staunch reply.</p>\n<p> \u201cAll right then,\u201d John said with a dramatic sigh. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t argue with that. One condition, though,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Sherlock asked, quirking an eyebrow.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou have to stay in bed with me,\u201d John replied.</p>\n<p> \u201cVery agreeable terms, Mr. Watson. You have yourself a deal,\u201d Sherlock said, and leaned forward to seal it with a kiss.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the attack, John moved in with Sherlock and Henry. It was a large step for such a new relationship, but both of them had been certain it was something they wanted to do. John had been in relationships before, but none of them had come with that feeling of certainty; the \u2018yes, this is where I belong,\u2019 until Sherlock. It made the decision easy, and easier still when they told Henry and the boy was so overjoyed at the prospect that he didn\u2019t stop talking for ten minutes.</p>\n<p> The transition was easy and natural. John had expected to have to work out kinks in their routines, but it somehow all slid easily into place. There were, of course, several times where John discovered experiments creeping onto the food side of the counter, but he was alone in the counter\u2019s defense as both Sherlock and Henry were involved in the experimentation process. When confronted, Henry at least had the decency to look slightly abashed. Sherlock claimed they couldn\u2019t help it that genius couldn\u2019t be confined to a mere two-thirds of the counter, which made Henry giggle and softened John\u2019s stern facade. </p>\n<p> John sat on the floor, helping Henry wrap presents for Sherlock. Henry had made him a bee figure out of a plastic ball covered in very shiny black and yellow gems, and was handling it with the utmost care as he placed it into a box.</p>\n<p> \u201cPapa,\u201d Henry began as he tucked tissue paper around the bee. He had started calling John that soon after he\u2019d moved in, and although John and Sherlock were not married nor had John officially adopted Henry, neither had the heart to correct him. \u201cHow come we\u2019re wrapping presents for Daddy if Santa\u2019s gonna bring us presents?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBecause your dad\u2019s on the naughty list,\u201d John replied as he smooth a piece of tape over bright red wrapping paper. When he saw Henry\u2019s distraught expression, he smiled and ruffled Henry\u2019s curls. \u201cJust joking, don\u2019t worry. But even though Santa brings us presents, it\u2019s still nice to get presents for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cMe and Daddy got you a present. A really <i>good</i> present,\u201d Henry said with a smug smile. \u201cBut it\u2019s a secret so I\u2019m not tellin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood, I wouldn\u2019t want my surprise to be ruined,\u201d John replied, finishing off the present with a silver bow.</p>\n<p> Henry looked slightly put out by this, but quickly recovered and continued to wrap his present with good cheer. \u201cDaddy\u2019s gonna love this present the best,\u201d he said with utmost confidence.</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d John replied, equally certain.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> Much to Sherlock\u2019s chagrin, it was decided that a Christmas gathering would be held at 221B. His complaint was that they had hosted Thanksgiving and that had been more than enough for him, thank you very much. However, John retaliated with the fact that three of the six people attending already lived there, and one other was extremely close by. After a large amount of cajoling and a moderate amount of kissing, Sherlock had relented.</p>\n<p> Christmas Day had not yet dawned when Sherlock and John were awoken by a rather exuberant bounce on their bed accompanied by a shout of \u201cSANTA CAME COME LOOK AT ALL THE PRESENTS\u201d before a pattering of feet told them that Henry had rushed back out to the living room. Sherlock pulled the blanket over his head and John groaned.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe\u2019s your son before sunrise,\u201d John mumbled as he rubbed a hand over his face.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat?\u201d Sherlock asked, quirking his only visible eyebrow.</p>\n<p> \u201cLion King quote. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d John replied, rolling to face Sherlock.</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course I have. I just haven\u2019t <i>memorized</i> it,\u201d he teased, planting a kiss on John\u2019s nose. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s - <i>oof</i>,\u201d he grunted as a hurtling projectile fueled by Christmas spirit landed once again in their bed. </p>\n<p> \u201cCome <i>onnn</i>,\u201d Henry pleaded, tugging at various limbs.</p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019re coming,\u201d John said, remembering fondly his own Christmases as a child. </p>\n<p> Soon they were seated around the tree, with tea for the adults and hot chocolate for Henry, which was being ignored in favor of tearing open a present. There was much excited commentary as Henry opened his gifts, and the pile of discarded wrapping grew larger and larger. When Henry had opened everything for him, he crawled under the tree and pulled out a package that read \u201cTo: Papa, From: Daddy and Henry\u201d on the tag. Henry plopped it in John\u2019s lap and sat as close as he could without actually being in John\u2019s lap along with the present. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell doesn\u2019t this look lovely,\u201d John commented with a smile as he took in the many, <i>many</i> bows decorating the top of the package. </p>\n<p> Henry smiled proudly and said, \u201cDaddy helped me with the paper but I did the bows all by myself!\u201d</p>\n<p> John laughed and said in a mock-whisper, \u201cI thought so. Your daddy doesn\u2019t have much of an artistic eye, does he?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry giggled as Sherlock pretended to be offended. \u201cOpen it up!\u201d he urged.</p>\n<p> John did so, being careful not to dislodge any of the bows. Inside the box was the complete series of M*A*S*H on DVD. John looked up in surprise. \u201cHow did you -\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry could contain himself no longer. \u201cSURPRISE!\u201d he shouted about three inches away from John\u2019s face. \u201cI figured it out!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBut - how?\u201d John asked, confused. Meanwhile, Sherlock looked on proudly.</p>\n<p> \u201c\u2018Cause I sometimes sneaked down the stairs to watch you when I couldn\u2019t sleep for naps, and you were watching it on TV!\u201d Henry explained. Then, when he realized he had admitted he hadn\u2019t been taking a nap during nap time, he looked slightly guilty.</p>\n<p> John enfolded him in a tight hug. \u201cYou are very clever, just as smart as your dad,\u201d he said, feeling suddenly overwhelmed by how fortunate he was just to have met Sherlock and Henry, let alone live with them and be a part of their family. \u201cThank you very much. I love it.\u201d</p>\n<p> With a grin, Henry wriggled out of John\u2019s grasp and retrieved a small box for Sherlock, which he handed over with great care before settling himself to Sherlock\u2019s immediate right, half in his lap. Sherlock carefully unwrapped the present, sliding it out of the colorful paper packaging. Opening the box, he lifted out the sparkling bee.</p>\n<p> \u201cI made it all by myself!\u201d Henry exclaimed with glee.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Sherlock said warmly, hugging Henry. \u201cI think I should put it in a special place of honor.\u201d Standing up, he walked to the mantle and placed the bee carefully next to the skull. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry looked somewhat in awe that his creation was keeping the skull company. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p>\n<p> John smiled fondly at both of them, then began collecting the discarded wrapping paper. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to be here in about an hour, so you two might want to change out of pajamas,\u201d he warned.</p>\n<p> When there was no response, John looked over at the pair. They were giving him identical \u2018do we have to?\u2019 looks. \u201cYes, you have to,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When Mrs. Hudson arrived, she immediately enfolded John, Sherlock, and Henry in a hug and made several comments about how happy she was for her boys. Henry wriggled out of the hug, Sherlock rolled his eyes but smiled, and John said polite thank yous and how they were happy too. </p>\n<p> When Mycroft and Greg arrived, Sherlock glanced at them and then did a double take. \u201cOh god,\u201d he groaned.</p>\n<p> John looked up from his food preparation. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock just shook his head and waved at the two men in the doorway.</p>\n<p> \u201cI believe what my brother is trying to say is that Gregory and I are...ah, something of a couple,\u201d Mycroft said delicately. Greg shrugged and grinned.</p>\n<p> \u201cHis name\u2019s not <i>Gregory</i>!\u201d Henry piped up from where he was \u201chelping\u201d put the rolls on a plate (one of which was missing a significant portion).</p>\n<p> Greg chuckled. \u201cGreg is short for Gregory. But he\u2019s the only one who calls me that. Not even my own mom does,\u201d he teased, nudging Mycroft with his shoulder.</p>\n<p> \u201cI think it sounds nice,\u201d Mycroft huffed.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh, spare me,\u201d Sherlock said, sweeping through the sitting room to look out one of the large windows. \u201cYour car is still here,\u201d Sherlock said, narrowing his eyes. \u201cWhy - you <i>didn\u2019t</i>,\u201d he said, aghast. </p>\n<p> \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea what you mean,\u201d Mycroft smirked. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhat?\u201d Henry asked eagerly, tugging at Sherlock\u2019s jacket. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t he do?\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough, I imagine.\u201d</p>\n<p> John looked on curiously as Henry began pestering his uncle for answers. They didn\u2019t have long to wait to find out, though. Two men dressed in impeccable black suits carefully carried in a very large box, several feet long and wrapped in shiny red paper with a large silver bow on top. An equally large gift tag read in precise curving script \u201cTo: Henry; Love, Uncle Mycroft.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers as he carefully approached the giant gift. \u201cThis is the biggest present I ever seen in my LIFE!\u201d he exclaimed as he examined it from every angle. </p>\n<p> It was plain to see he was fit to burst from excitement, so John said, \u201cGo ahead, you can open it. We\u2019ll do the others after dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p> With glee Henry pulled the oversized bow off and tossed it behind him, then began tearing the paper. \u201cOh! Daddy, look!\u201d he shouted as he uncovered the mysterious gift. He was darting back and forth, frantically getting the paper off. \u201cIt\u2019s just like the one me and Papa made!</p>\n<p> Once all the paper had been removed, it was easy to see that what Mycroft had brought was a life-size version of the \u2018bunny house\u2019 John and Henry had created together. It looked exquisitely crafted and included everything a bunny might need.</p>\n<p> From inside the closed-off hutch area there was a small rustling noise. Henry immediately stilled, then carefully crouched down next to the cage and peered inside the small opening. A fuzzy white head with floppy ears poked out, nose twitching as it took in its new surroundings.</p>\n<p> The only sound Henry managed to make was a small squeak.</p>\n<p> \u201cI was assured he\u2019d be quite friendly,\u201d Mycroft began. \u201cHis breed is known for their friendly temperaments. He\u2019s a -\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHolland Lop!\u201d Henry interrupted with a grin. \u201cYou can tell cause he\u2019s so tiny and he has floppy ears and a squishy face.\u201d</p>\n<p> Mycroft smiled. \u201cIndeed. And when he\u2019s old enough, I will cover the cost of having him neutered.\u201d</p>\n<p> Henry jumped up and barreled into his uncle, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist. \u201cThank you for my bunny this is the best present ever!\u201d He pulled back, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation he hugged Greg, too. </p>\n<p> \u201cHow old is he?\u201d Henry asked, kneeling once again in front of the cage to peer at the small rabbit, who had emerged from the enclosed space.</p>\n<p> \u201cNine weeks,\u201d Mycroft replied with a small smile.</p>\n<p> \u201cCan you help me get him out?\u201d Henry asked.</p>\n<p> Mycroft hesitated slightly, and Greg stepped in smoothly. \u201cI used to have rabbits when I was a kid,\u201d he explained, immediately and unknowingly endearing himself to Henry forever. \u201cI can probably help you out,\u201d he said with a grin.</p>\n<p> They didn\u2019t have much trouble with it. As soon as Henry opened the door, the small rabbit immediately came to check it out and Greg confidently and carefully scooped him up, depositing him in Henry\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p> Henry looked in awe at the small creature, gently petting his head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna name him Bluebell, cause he has blue eyes,\u201d Henry declared. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna take the best care of him, I promise!\u201d he added sincerely.</p>\n<p> Despite Sherlock\u2019s earlier protests about letting Henry have a rabbit, John caught him looking on at the scene with overwhelming fondness.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re a big softie,\u201d John murmured teasingly as he nudged Sherlock with his shoulder.</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare breathe of word of it to anyone. I have a reputation to uphold,\u201d Sherlock replied quietly.</p>\n<p> John grinned, then said, \u201cAll right, who\u2019s ready for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p> When everyone had left and Henry had been put to bed (after a long argument about how he could not sleep on the floor next to Bluebell), John collapsed onto his and Sherlock\u2019s own bed with a contented sigh.</p>\n<p> \u201cI had one more present I was going to give you, but I think I\u2019m too exhausted,\u201d John said, looking over at Sherlock, who was changing into pajamas.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhy would giving me a present require - ah. Sex.\u201d</p>\n<p> John rolled onto his side. \u201cYou spoil all the fun. Take the mystery right out of things.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s what I do,\u201d Sherlock replied with a smirk. \u201cNow get changed so we can go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p> With an exaggerated, put-upon sigh, John got up and did as he was told. \u201cYou don\u2019t even sleep half the time. Why are you so eager to go to bed?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m not. But you need your sleep,\u201d Sherlock said, just a little too quickly.</p>\n<p> John crawled in bed with a grin. \u201cYou just like to be in bed with me. Admit it,\u201d he teased.</p>\n<p> Sherlock coughed. \u201cThere is a certain...level of comfort and calm when you are near, yes,\u201d he replied stiffly.</p>\n<p> John laughed and turned out the light, then snuggled up against Sherlock\u2019s back and wrapped an arm around his waist. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he said smugly into the back of Sherlock\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p> After a moment of silence, Sherlock said, \u201cIt would be unacceptable for you to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell I\u2019m pretty beat, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going anywhere for-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Sherlock cut him off. \u201cI don\u2019t mean now. I mean...ever,\u201d he explained haltingly.</p>\n<p> \u201cOh,\u201d John replied, slightly stunned.</p>\n<p> Sherlock turned over to face John. \u201cI want you to stay,\u201d he said quietly, vulnerability flickering across his features.</p>\n<p> To his surprise, John chuckled. \u201cDid you just propose to me?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, I - ah, I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d Sherlock began, flustered.</p>\n<p> \u201cDid you just propose to me on <i>Christmas</i>?\u201d John giggled, grin widening. \u201cHas my life turned into a rom-com?\u201d</p>\n<p> Frowning, Sherlock moved to turn over, but John held him fast in place. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d John said, kissing Sherlock gently. \u201cYou just caught me off guard. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p>\n<p> Sherlock smiled his actual, genuine smile. It was one of John\u2019s favorite things in the world. \u201cAre you accepting my proposal, then?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah, but I thought it wasn\u2019t a prop-\u201d</p>\n<p> John\u2019s answer was cut off by Sherlock\u2019s lips against his. \u201cGood,\u201d he murmured as he tucked his head under John\u2019s chin.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\u201d John replied, wrapping his arms around Sherlock. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>"
