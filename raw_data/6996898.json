  "text": "<p>\u201cScared Potter?\u201d Malfoy sneered, and Harry snapped. He was done, finished, fed up with playing the innocent little Gryffindor with no common sense and a microscopic amount of intelligence. He rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy yes Malfoy, I\u2019m terrified, can\u2019t you see me quaking in my boots? You, a second year child armed with a stick is the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.

Whatever shall I do?\u201d The entire hall fell silent and Malfoy gaped. Harry smirked. Lockhart looked entirely bemused, and he thought Snape might be holding back a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the count of three, then,\u201d Lockhart said. \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSerpensortia!\u201d Malfoy cried, and a large and certainly venomous snake poured out from his wand. An eastern brown snake, Harry thought.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhere am I? Attack!\u201d </em>\u00a0it cried, and lunged toward him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stop,\u201d</em> Harry commanded, deciding to see if he could give Snape an aneurysm. The snake rose to inspect him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>A speaker?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes. I will provide you with food and warmth, and in return you will not bite me.\u201d</em> The snake uncoiled, then slithered toward him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Agreed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry my boy, I\u2019ll sort it out!\u201d Lockhart cried. He raised his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cExpelliarmus,\u201d Harry hissed, and snatched Lockhart\u2019s wand out the air. \u201cYou really are a fool.\u201d Lockhart looked gobsmacked and he could almost\u00a0hear Hermione\u2019s gasp of horror. He knelt before the snake and it coiled around his arm and up his body.</p>\n<p><em>\"Male or female?<em>\u201d </em></em>he hissed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFemale. Obviously<em>.\u201d</em></em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you Malfoy. I\u2019ll be keeping her.\u201d Malfoy was gaping. \u201cExpelliarmus,\u201d Harry said again, and received Malfoy\u2019s wand for his trouble. Snape pursed his mouth. Harry threw their wands onto the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI win.\u201d He grinned and hopped off the duelling platform.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My name\u2019s Harry,\" \u00a0</em>he told the snake<em>. \u201cWhat\u2019s yours? What do you like to eat?\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI am Baneofallrodents,\u201d </em>Harry was summarily informed. \u201c<em>I eat rodents</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cHow could you disarm and insult a teacher?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLockhart is an imbecile, not a teacher,\u201d he said with a smirk, and she gaped.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry! You can\u2019t say that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can. I just did.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeya mate! You\u2019re not actually keeping the snake? And why didn\u2019t you tell us you could speak parselmouth?\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cI am a parselmouth, and I speak parseltongue. And you never told us that you spoke idiot, yet you manage to prove it every time you open your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if to prove him right, Ron frowned, and then gaped as he figured out the insult. \u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs for horses.\u201d Out the corner of his eye Harry could see Hermione giggling.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pea sized brain. To the common room?\u201d They strode off. It was rather easy to make way through the crowds with a snake wrapped around him. People seemed to be afraid of it, for some reason.</p>\n<p>Harry was later summoned to the Headmaster\u2019s office, whereupon he was faced with McGonagall, Snape and Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, Harry, it\u2019s good to see you. Are you well and keeping up with your studies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Harry replied, rather suspicious as to why he was there.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn excellent defeat of young Draco in duelling club I must say.\u201d Harry kept silent. \u201cAnd impressive skills subduing the snake. But I\u2019m afraid I must tell you that you cannot keep it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer,\u201d Harry interrupted. \u201cShe\u2019s female.\u201d Snape\u2019s mouth twitched.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes, very good,\u201d Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cBut my point still stands. She\u2019s not on the list of permitted pets and so I\u2019m afraid she must go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDing,\u201d Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. \u201cThat\u2019s my bullshit detector,\u201d Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. \u201cRon has a rat, Lee has a tarantula, and therefore I can only conclude that the reason you don\u2019t want me keeping a snake is because it\u2019s a snake, and thus has ominous connotations with Slytherin and everything \u2018evil.\u201d Snape\u2019s mouth twitched again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrankly, I suspect that snakes once were on the permitted pets list. A cat for Gryffindors, an owl for Ravenclaws and a toad for Hufflepuffs, and therefore snakes for Slytherin.\u201d Dumbledore blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive points from Gryffindor for your cheek, Potter,\u201d Snape snapped. Harry rather felt that it was because the man was jealous that he couldn\u2019t call Dumbledore out on his bullshit, being employed by him and all.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe that as it may, your snake is an Eastern Brown Snake, one of the most venomous in the world, and potentially a danger to students.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDing,\u201d Harry said again, once more shocking the adults judging by their shocked expressions (gasp!). \u201cLee\u2019s tarantula is venomous, and I haven\u2019t heard a word of complaint against it. And Lee can\u2019t even communicate with it. <em>Baneofallrodents</em> has promised not to bite anyone who\u2019s not trying to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore smiled. \u201cWhat did you call it-her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Baneofallrodents.</em> Oh. Sorry. Baneofallrodents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled again.</p>\n<p>\u201cBane of all rodents? What an unusual name. I suppose you have a point. Very well. You have a week long probationary period, and if it proves to be that you can control her you may keep her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, my boy, I would like to reaffirm that you will be safe at Hogwarts. Nobody will try to kill you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDing,\u201d Harry said, and noticed McGonagall cover her mouth with her hand and exchange an amused look with Snape. \u201cEnormous three headed dogs. A troll. An insane genocidal lunatic who taught Defence Against the Dark Arts. To mention a few.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill that be all, Professor?\u201d he said, pasting on his sweetest and most innocent expression. Snape rolled his eyes and Harry cheered silently in victory.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Mr Potter. That will be all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cArrogant little twerp,\u201d Severus muttered once Potter had left.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Dumbledore said, twinkling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDing,\u201d Minerva said, a sly grin on her face. \u201cOh my, the power\u2019s gone to my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus swept away and into his office and threw a handful of floo powder on the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius was sitting in his office and nodded a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh Severus, I thought I might be hearing from you. I just received a rather interesting owl from Draco. Do come through.\u201d Severus stepped into the floo and joined Lucius at his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will not believe the conversation I just witnessed,\u201d he said, finally allowing his mirth at Potters audacity to show.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter Draco\u2019s letter I\u2019m sure you could tell me that there are pigs with wings and I'd stand and take a look out my window.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco told you about Potter adopting the snake? Being a parselmouth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Albus was of course having none of it, wanted Potter to have as little \u2018Dark\u2019 influence in his life as possible, and told Potter he couldn\u2019t keep the snake, on the grounds that it wasn't on the list of permitted pets. And Potter then goes \u2018Ding. That\u2019s my bullshit detector.\u2019\u201d Severus laughed and Lucius snorted. He filled the other man in on the rest of the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlbus did a one eighty when he realised that it was an argument he wasn\u2019t going to win. Presumably to continue being seen as the benevolent all-knowing grandfather figure, although I rather suspect that Potter's got him sussed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius looked thoughtful. \u201cThat suggests the boy is more independent than we previously thought. Sounds like there\u2019s a bit of Slytherin inside him. I wonder if we can sway him to our side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus privately agreed, which worried him slightly. He\u2019d misjudged the boy greatly. He\u2019d hidden his entire personality, made himself to be the image of a perfect Gryffindor. He\u2019d seen Potter roll his eyes the moment he\u2019d given up. Draco had taunted him, and Potter had found it to be so hilariously stupid that he couldn\u2019t help but say something.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to know the snake\u2019s name?\u201d Severus said with a chuckle, dismissing his current thoughts to dwell on later. Lucius raised a brow. \u201cBane of all rodents.\u201d Lucius smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost humorous,\u201d he agreed.</p>\n<p>Harry strode into Transfiguration, <em>Baneofallrodents</em> wrapped around his neck. There had already been one incident that morning with Scabbers, but Ron had managed to snatch the rat away just in time. \u201cYou should be a keeper, with those reflexes,\u201d Harry had remarked, and Ron had been so astounded by the sudden compliment that he forgot to berate Harry for allowing his snake to attack Ron\u2019s rat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look nice today,\u201d he said to Hermione, seating himself next to her. She blushed. Harry smiled inwardly. Point to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuiet please,\u201d McGonagall said. \u201cToday we shall be learning how to turn a rabbit into a slipper.\u201d There was a flick of her wand and a rabbit appeared on each of their tables. <em>Baneofallrodents</em> lunged forward, biting the rabbit. Everyone stared. <em>Baneofallrodents</em> began the slow process of swallowing it. Harry smiled sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. She\u2019s hungry. Next time give me a warning, and I\u2019ll tell her not to eat it,\u201d he told McGonagall.\u00a0\u201c<em>Naughty. I told you not to bite anything!\u201d</em>\u00a0 he hissed.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou told me not to bite any human,\"</em>\u00a0she replied, rather smug to have found a loophole. Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Well now I\u2019m telling you not to bite anything unless I tell you that it is food.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine,\"\u00a0</em>she replied in a resigned tone.</p>\n<p>Harry smiled winningly. \u201cShe won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall stared at <em>Baneofallrodents, </em>a perturbed expression upon her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee that she doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said, and with a wave of her wand Harry had another rabbit.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, the incantation is \u2018Lepmutavsol\u2019, and the wand movement is this.\u201d She demonstrated. Harry grinned. It was time to start demonstrating to the world that Harry Potter was not an imbecile.</p>\n<p>\u201cLepmutavsol,\u201d he murmured, flicking his wand. Instead of a rabbit sat a pair of fluffy white slippers. McGonagall looked startled, then beamed.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good Mr Potter! Five points to Gryffindor.\u201d Ron was gaping (he did that a lot), and Hermione looked frustrated. He slid his chair closer to hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you perform a spell, what do you feel?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>She frowned. \u201cA rush of magic,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cOkay, now, before you perform the spell, try and pull that feeling to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her forehead crinkled as she focused. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow perform the spell, visualising the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>She did, and there sat a lovely pair of slippers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks Harry,\u201d she whispered. He grinned. He could practically feel Malfoy\u2019s glare. He turned and winked at the blonde, who nearly fell off his seat. Merlin, but\u00a0idiot baiting was so much fun.</p>\n<p>They were sitting at Gryffindor table for lunch when Harry actually began to take note of the whispers surrounding him. They focused on one thing: Harry was the Heir of Slytherin. He tried not to chuckle at the absurdity of that suggestion. People were sheep. Harry decided to take his turn at being shepherd.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about me being the Heir of Slytherin, then?\u201d he asked his part of Gryffindor table. A number of them blushed, or looked away. He could feel the rest of the Hall quiet. Ah, the profits of being famous.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlytherin,\u201d he instructed the table, as if the entire Hall wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cSlytherin is the house of cunning. If I was the Heir of Slytherin, why on earth would I demonstrate that I was a parselmouth, and have a pet snake? It\u2019s far too obvious. Besides, those of you who have done your research know that the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, and I wasn\u2019t even alive then. So it\u2019s obviously not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is in then?\u201d someone cried, and he saw Snape wince. Hehe. He turned to the rest of the hall, not even bothering to pretend that he wasn\u2019t addressing them all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that is the question. Who was alive when it first opened? Who would we least expect it to be? And who is a powerful enough wizard to open the Chamber?\u201d They waited with bated breath. Harry smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Dumbledore, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape looked resigned. Dumbledore looked surprised. Hagrid looked angry. McGonagall looked amused. The students gasped, and as one turned to look at the teacher\u2019s table. Harry supressed a giggle. What a load of idiots.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione hissed to get his attention. Students began running out the hall, likely to inform their parents. Oh he was good, he was so good.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome along minions, off we go to Potions,\u201d Harry said, and led the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione hissed even louder. \u201cFirstly, I object to being called a minion, and secondly, you can\u2019t just say that about a teacher!\u201d Harry rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione your unfounded respect and slavish devotion to figures of authority is going to get you into trouble one day, and I\u2019ll be there to tell you I told you so,\u201d he told her. \u201cBesides, if I was a normal student I\u2019d be feeling horrible about the fact\u00a0that people suspected me of attacking their friends, and that the teachers have done nothing to dissuade them of the idea. So I merely gave them a new one. It\u2019s a load of bollocks, of course, but so is the suggestion that I\u2019m to blame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione wrapped him into a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Harry! Why didn\u2019t you say you were feeling bullied.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eh? How on earth had she drawn that conclusion? He shrugged, and let her believe it.</p>\n<p>He sat next to Hermione in Potions.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw come on mate, we always sit together,\u201d Ron said. Harry smiled viciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re the reason our potions are what some might call disastrous, or others might call catastrophically awful. You lack the fortitude for hard work and concentration that Potions requires, and the mental acuity to understand the interactions between ingredients that is essential for the completion of any potion harder than a cure for boils. Don\u2019t worry, you can partner with Seamus, perhaps that way only one cauldron, instead of two, gets blown up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron frowned. \u201cSo we\u2019re making new friends? Okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared. How had he put up with that imbecile for over a year?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be so hard on him,\u201d Hermione told him snottily, but he could see a faint glimmer of amusement in her eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop being mean when he stops being an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I see. So never?\u201d she said. Harry beamed and patted her on the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHurrah, you\u2019re learning!\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape swished in with his swishy robes swishing about. He watched Harry curiously for the entire lesson, and barely did more than sneer at him. Then Harry felt a light probe of Legilimency. His drew up his barriers, leaving only a message in burning letters. <em>Legilimency on a minor is illegal. </em>Snape pulled out of his mind and gazed at him with wide eyes. Harry smirked, and turned in a perfect potion.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood day sir!\u201d he said cheerily as he walked out the room. They retreated to the common room before dinner, where <em>Baneofallrodents </em>slithered up to him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master, master!\u201d</em>\u00a0he cried. (For Harry was unpronounceable in parseltongue.) \u201c<em>The rodent turned into a human when I tried to eat him!\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cBaneofallrodents, what have I told you about not eating other people\u2019s pets?\u201d </em>Harry hissed, then froze as he realised the implications. <em>\u201cDoes he know that we can communicate?\u201d</em>\u00a0he asked, looking around for Ron\u2019s rat. There it was, dozing in Ron\u2019s hands. Oh holy fuck that was a human. An animagus.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No,\u201d</em> <em>Baneofallrodents </em>hissed. Harry collected Hedwig\u2019s cage.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Ron,\u201d Harry said, casual like. \u201cDo you mind if I take Scabbers to get some food. He\u2019s looking a bit peaky.\u201d Ron peered at Scabbers, and shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Ron muttered. Harry took the rat, which was still asleep, and debated the best course of action as he placed it into the cage, which he shrunk slightly. Snape or McGonagall. Or both? He raced down the corridors and to McGonagall\u2019s office, wand ready to Stupify the rat before it could do anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Professor!\u201d he said with a gasp as he entered the room. Luckily for him they were both present. \u201cWould you mind charming this cage unbreakable?\u201d he asked with a cute smile. McGonagall narrowed her eyes, but muttered the incantation.</p>\n<p>\u201cStupefy,\u201d Harry muttered, pointing it at the rat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Mr Potter?\u201d she asked, and Snape stood with folded arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>Baneofallrodents</em> was trying to eat Scabbers, and then she told me that he turned into a human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this?\u201d Snape growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Weasley\u2019s rat has lived for eleven years! Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s rather suspicious for a rat? And I swear it\u2019s not a joke. He slept in Ron\u2019s bed!\u201d McGonagall and Snape exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe better take this to the aurors,\u201d McGonagall murmured, and Snape muttered an agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf this is a prank\u2026\u201d Snape left the rest unsaid. Harry snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I was going to pull a prank I\u2019d do a much better job than this, and it would be much funnier.\u201d Harry scoffed. McGonagall and Snape fixed him with glares. \u201cNot that I would,\u201d he said brightly.</p>\n<p>It was Snape's turn to scoff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cDumbledore is the Heir of Slytherin?\u201d McGonagall reminded him.</p>\n<p>Harry looked affronted. \u201cDing!\u201d he said. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s not the Heir of Slytherin. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like your father,\u201d Snape muttered. McGonagall gave him an amused glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf you go, Mr Potter. I\u2019ll let you know what we discover.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry met Malfoy on the way back to Gryffindor tower.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter. I\u2019d like to offer you a truce,\u201d he said stiffly.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cYour father finally write back to you then?\u201d</p>\n<p>If possible, Malfoy stiffened further. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scoffed. \u201cIf you say so. Right, you\u2019re a Slytherin. Are you the Heir?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No! I thought it was Dumbledore?\u201d Malfoy said, brow arching as if he disdained the very thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! What gave you that idea? Of course it\u2019s not Dumbledore.\u201d Harry frowned. \u201cDamn. We had such a great plan. Hermione\u2019s brewing Polyjuice, and we were going to kidnap Crabbe and Goyle and pretend to be them to get the information out of you. I guess we don\u2019t have do to that now.\u201d Then Harry narrowed his eyes. \u201cOr have we done it already? Is Crabbe really Harry, and Goyle really Ron, and I\u2019m really Hermione?\u201d Malfoy glanced at him suspiciously, then at the two lumps by his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe we haven\u2019t done it yet, but we will soon. Keep your wits about you! And watch out for Lockhart. Last year the incompetent teacher was actually Voldemort in disguise. Why not this year?\u201d Malfoy looked horrified. \u201cAlright Malfoy, I suppose, after all your begging and pleading, I can accept a truce. See ya later!\u201d Harry said, and ran off, stifling a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione my darling!\u201d Harry cried as he entered the common room. She gazed up warily. He didn\u2019t blame her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy\u2019s not the Heir of Slytherin, I asked him, and then told him about our plan, so we can\u2019t use the Polyjuice for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like I actually ever thought he was the Heir. He\u2019s just too much of an idiot, and besides, he\u2019s got alibis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if the Heir commanded the monster to act after he left?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re giving Malfoy far too much credit. However, I do have an even better idea for what we can do with the Polyjuice,\u201d he said, an evil grin upon his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Hermione muttered. \u201cWhy does this always happen to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Severus sighed after Potter left the room. Bloody Potter. Minerva threw floo powder into the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cAuror\u2019s Office,\u201d she cried. Kingsley Shacklebolt waved them through.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I do for you today?\u201d he said jovially. Minerva placed the cage on his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of our students has claimed that the Weasley\u2019s pet rat is an unregistered animagus, and has been sleeping in Ron Weasley\u2019s bed,\u201d she said with a growl. Kingsley frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is suspicious. Let\u2019s take it to a holding cell.\u201d The rat was deposited into a cell, and Minerva cast the animagus revealing spell. There was a flash of light, and instead of a rat there was a human. Even worse, that human was Peter Pettigrew.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Kingsley said, and Severus rather felt that was an understatement. After a very enlightening veritaserum interview, repeated two times in front of Amelia Bones, and Rufus Scrimgeour, a task force was assembled to retrieve Black from Azkaban. \u00a0Bones was storming around the office.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever had a trial!\u201d she cried. \u201cGet me Crouch in here right now! Bring up the all of the transcripts of these supposed imprisoned Death Eaters! I want answers people, and I want them right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Mr Potter does seem to like causing trouble,\u201d Minerva observed. Severus thought back to the floods of owls Dumbledore was dealing with, questioning their children\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d he muttered. \"Bloody Potter.\"</p>\n<p>The headlines were rather impressive, that morning.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">MINISTRY SCANDAL</p>\n<p align=\"center\">PETER PETTIGREW FOUND ALIVE AND MASQUERADING AS A FAMILY PET</p>\n<p align=\"center\">SIRIUS BLACK INNOCENT</p>\n<p align=\"center\">CROUCH SUSPENDED: INVESTIGATION INTO POST WAR TRIALS PENDING</p>\n<p>Sirius Black, renowned criminal and mass murderer, accused of the homicide of Peter Pettigrew and twelve muggles has been found innocent of all crimes! The handsome Lord of the Black family tells all in exclusive interview to this privileged reporter, me; Rita Skeeter! Black was also believed to be the Secret Keeper for the Fidelius Charm surrounding the Potter\u2019s house in 1981, and the one who betrayed them to You Know Who, resulting in their murder. (For more information on the Fidelius Charm turn to page 12.)</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was that piece of vermin, Peter Pettigrew who was the real Secret Keeper! I was just a decoy.\u201d Black\u2019s stunning blue eyes fill with tears. \u201cHe betrayed my best friend and his wife. When I discovered they were dead I gave my godson, Harry Potter (the Boy Who Lived) into Hagrid\u2019s safe keeping, and chased after him.\u201d He pauses, shaking with emotion. \u201cI found him, but he got the better of me, and blew up the street, yelling that it was me who had betrayed them.\u201d Black\u2019s eyes flash with righteous anger, and this reporter grips the edge of her seat in anticipation. \u201cHe then transformed into his animagus form, a rat, and disappeared into the sewers, and that was when the aurors found and arrested me.\u201d</p>\n<p>A thrilling tale indeed!</p>\n<p>Luckily for Black, Pettigrew, who had been masquerading as a pet rat for the eleven years while Black resided in Azkaban was found by none other than the Boy Who Lived: Harry Potter, who discovered that Pettigrew was an illegal animagus. Potter brought this to the attention of his Head of House, who brought said rat to the aurors. Our young hero strikes again for justice! Black has been freed, and Pettigrew imprisoned, to the relief of all.</p>\n<p>One can\u2019t help but wonder how the Ministry could have failed so badly? What other injustices have occurred?</p>\n<p>Black is currently residing in medical facility to aid his recovery from years of incarceration. A Wizengamot meeting will be held on the 14<sup>th</sup> to determine Pettigrew\u2019s sentence, and reparations for both Black and the Weasleys, with whom Pettigrew hid.</p>\n<p>Currently under investigation is Bartemius Crouch, whom was responsible for Black\u2019s long stint in Azkaban without a trial. All post war trials are to be reviewed and evaluated. Questions are being raised about the competence of both the current and last administration.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else may be residing in Azkaban without cause?\u201d Lucius Malfoy asks. \u201cSirius Black is the Head of an Ancient and Noble House, yet he was tossed away as if he was trash. It is discomforting to consider that I could be in his very position.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur Weasley, whose son Percy first owned the rat before it was passed onto Ronald, claims ignorance of the rat\u2019s true form. \u201cIt is very worrying that he\u2019s lived in my house all this time. I am very grateful to Mr Potter for discovering his deception.\u201d\u2026</p>\n<p>Harry glanced around. The Hall was hushed as each person read the paper. Those that didn\u2019t own their own copy were reading over other\u2019s shoulders. Percy looked like he was going to be sick, and the twins were comforting Ron, while Ginny\u2026 Ginny was absent. Harry frowned. He\u2019d hardly seen her at all this year. Every time he did she seemed to be getting paler and paler.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Baneofallrodents, would you mind keeping an eye on Ginny Weasley. The ginger one.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThere are many ginger ones.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThe female.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOf course master.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. It seemed that some of his Boy Who Lived persona had rubbed off on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Potter,\u201d Percy said pompously. \u201cYou have my gratitude for uncovering this deception.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. But really it was <em>Baneofallrodents</em>. She saw him transform from rat to human, and then informed me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Baneofallrodents</em> hissed her appreciation. Percy eyed her nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you hisssss,\u201d he said, still pompous. Harry chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. Her name is Baneofallrodents. It just sounds like a hiss when I say it in parseltongue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Thank you Bane of all rodents. An apt name indeed.\u201d He nodded to them both, and retook his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cPompous prat,\u201d Harry muttered to himself. The Weasley twins, although still pale, grinned, and gave him a thumbs up.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later Harry was sitting in the Headmaster\u2019s office, and Sirius Black tumbled out the floo.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d he cried.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius,\u201d Harry said with a nod. Sirius scooped him up into a hug and Harry froze. Right. Affectionate caregivers. Harry was going to have to get used to that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo nice to see you again,\u201d Sirius said, looking like he was going to start crying. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for discovering Pettigrew and uncovering the truth.\u201d He squeezed Harry\u2019s shoulder, eyes bright but clear and sharp.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeadmaster,\u201d he greeted cordially. Harry hid a smirk. One of the many things they\u2019d discussed over letters was the fact that Dumbledore, as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, had had ample opportunities to get Sirius a trial. Another was Harry\u2019s treatment at the hands of the Dursleys, which he\u2019d hinted at carefully. Suffice to say, Sirius Black was not a fan of Albus Dumbledore. He was not the na\u00efve follower that had existed twelve years ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cSplendid to see you again my dear boy! And once again I must apologise for not realising the truth and getting you a trial sooner.\u201d Dumbledore hadn\u2019t been told until the day of the trial. Why should he be? He was only Chief Warlock, and therefore required to preside over trials to ensure justice, not interfere with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Sirius said. Harry resisted the urge to ding. He was saving it for later.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well I asked you to come through my office before having your chit chat with young Harry to explain a few things to you. You plan on taking his guardianship?\u201d Sirius nodded. Dumbledore affected a saddened look. \u201cI see. As it stands at the moment, with Voldemort already having tried to attack Harry, I must tell you that you need to leave Harry as he is, with his family. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDing! Ding ding ding!\u201d Harry cried. Dumbledore sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sirius asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my bullshit detector,\u201d Harry explained. Sirius grinned, then chuckled, then coughed, obviously trying to hold in his laughter. \u201cI do not understand! I hate my family, and they hate me, and don\u2019t even try and tell me the wards there are better than anywhere else, because they\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore frowned. \u201cNow Harry, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true. They\u2019re your family, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey loathe me! Family don\u2019t lock you into a cupboard for ten years of your life. Only an imbecile could have missed the signs of abuse when they came to deliver my Hogwarts letter, so of course you sent Hagrid, who couldn't comprehend abuse if it sat on him. There is no way I\u2019m staying with the Dursleys now I have a caring and competent guardian, one whom my parents originally intended me to live with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius was bristling beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear boy, I understand that you are not happy with them, but they are your mother\u2019s blood, and I\u2019m sure they love you. There are blood wards around the house that power the protection granted to you the night your mother died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDing. The wards around the house are barely there. Check.\u201d Dumbledore narrowed his eyes, and pulled a device from a drawer.\u00a0 He tapped it, and it span once, then puttered out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? That cannot be possible. The only way for them to fail would be if\u2026\u201d He stared at a device in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t love me?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cWell done. They don\u2019t. Never have, never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius patted Harry on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems to me, Headmaster that you\u2019ve been interfering where you shouldn\u2019t have. I will be applying for Harry\u2019s guardianship, and he will never see the Dursleys again. Frankly, you\u2019re luckily I\u2019m not bringing both you and them up on charges. Now, will that be all?\u201d Sirius asked. Dumbledore nodded, still staring at the device. Harry and Sirius left the office, and found an empty class room. Sirius smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit detector? I like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \u201cWould you like to meet your saviour?\u201d he asked. Sirius frowned, and <em>Baneofallrodents</em> poked her head out of Harry\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Baneofallrodents. <em>This is Sirius.</em> She\u2019s the one who noticed Pettigrew was not just a rat.<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Sirius said, a bemused expression upon his face. \u201cA snake? And I didn\u2019t realise parseltongue was a Potter trait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaced. \u201cI have a sneaking suspicion it\u2019s from Voldemort. I have a strange connection to him. He possessed a professor last year, and every time I was near him my scar hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius frowned. \u201cStrange. I\u2019ll look into it. So, tell me about this year. There\u2019s a monster loose in the school petrifying people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a basilisk I think. It fits the criteria. Every time it kills only I can hear it talking, and a basilisk\u2019s gaze turns people to stone, or petrifies them if they see it in a mirror, or through something else. I\u2019ve no idea how it\u2019s getting out though, but it\u2019s definitely something to do with Voldemort again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful then. Hopefully the Headmaster will sort it out soon. Now, how\u2019s your year going? Pulling some Marauder worthy pranks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cEveryone thought I was the Heir of Slytherin, so I told them that it was too obvious, and that it had to be Dumbledore, because he was powerful and was here last time it opened. He\u2019s been having some trouble since them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius laughed. \u201cGood job Pronglet.\u201d He ruffled Harry\u2019s hair. \u201cMischief managed indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Hey, I perfected the stupid little Gryffindor act for over a year, I\u2019m practically one of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius looked affronted. \u201cStupid Gryffindor? I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed. \u201cYou will take over my guardianship though, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, trying to hide his anxiety.</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019 gaze softened. \u201cOf course pup. I\u2019ve got a clean bill of health, and the entire Ministry running around trying to make amends. I\u2019ve already lawyers working on it.\u201d Sirius made a face. \u201cI\u2019m taking up the mantle of Lord Black. I\u2019ll probably need it I\u2019m going to be protecting such a scrawny thing as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pouted. \u201cMeany.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius flicked him on the nose.\u00a0\u201cSquirt,\u201d he retorted.</p>\n<p>Harry and Hermione grinned at each other, then downed the Polyjuice. Harry couldn\u2019t actually believe Hermione was joining him, but he wasn\u2019t one to look a gift hippogriff in the mouth. They ambled into the Great Hall, arms linked. Fred and George were sitting side by side, focused on their food. A few people glanced up, then frowned as they noticed there were two sets of Weasley twins, and the whispers began. Harry sat next to twin one, and Hermione sat opposite\u00a0him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Fred,\u201d he said. Twin one looked up and grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello George,\u201d came the instant reply. Then twin one glanced either side of him. \u201cWe\u2019ve multiplied!\u201d he cried. Harry grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I was George?\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cNo. I\u2019m George.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I am!\u201d Twin two declared.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t all be George!\u201d Twin one insisted. Hermione pouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not George, then who am I?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Out the corner of his eye Harry caught a flicker of movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cUho! Bat incoming!\u201d he yelled. \u201cScatter!\u201d All four of them jumped up from the Gryffindor table and ran in different directions. Hermione had evidently embraced her role, and had jumped onto the Hufflepuff table, and was charging down it, sending platters of food crashing to the floor. Twin two was crawling under the benches.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the window,\u201d twin one cried as he ran frantically toward the window behind the teacher\u2019s table.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the wall!\u201d Harry threw himself against the stone wall of the Great Hall. Snape paused, glaring at all of them, trying to decide which one to go after.</p>\n<p>\u201cTil the sweat drips off my-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWEASLEY!\u201d Snape bellowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cRUN!\u201d twin two screamed, wriggling out from between Angelina\u2019s legs, and they all legged it out the hall.</p>\n<p>They ended up in an unused classroom, giggling on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was brilliant!\u201d twin one said. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Who our fellow troublemakers could be,\u201d twin two finished. He whipped out a piece of parchment. \u201cI solemnly swear I am up to no good,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Marauder\u2019s Map!\u201d Harry said. Both twins looked up and frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way!\u201d they exclaimed in unison.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, how did you know?\u201d twin one asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were four Gryffindors called Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter. Sirius was telling me about it in his last letter. Where did you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0The twins grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe owe them so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFound it in our first year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNicked it from Filch\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a wrench to give it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s your birth right.\u201d They beckoned him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know how to use it?\u201d Harry nodded. He tapped the map.</p>\n<p>\u201cFind Severus Snape,\u201d he instructed it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Messers Prongs would like to inform you that Snivellus is rapidly approaching.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Messers Padfoot agrees and hopes you\u2019ve set up a prank.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Messers Moony thinks Messers Padfoot ought to watch out as he might get pranked himself.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Messers Wormtail would like to remind you that you better scramble unless you want to get caught. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Snape\u2019s dot was rather close.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, nobody move,\u201d Harry said. \u201cDissolute,\u201d he muttered, tapping his wand on each of their heads. When he tapped his own it felt like an egg was being cracked open upon him. They all faded from sight and not a moment too soon. Snape pushed the door open, slamming it into the wall behind it. His beady eyes scanned the room, then he strode back out. His footsteps echoed down the hall. When they faded Harry removed the disillusionment charm. Fred and George were beaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d they declared. Harry tapped the map.</p>\n<p>\u201cMischief Managed. You guys are welcome to borrow it whenever, you know.\u201d A few moments later the Polyjuice wore off. Harry flicked his wand, resizing his robes. Hermione grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get changed. See you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pocketed the map.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m off for breakfast.\u201d He trotted out the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait! You didn\u2019t tell us how you managed it.\u201d The call came from behind him. Harry grinned, and sped away. He entered the hall, which was in uproar, and seated himself next to Neville.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. Neville looked rather surprised at being addressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFred and George managed to duplicate themselves so there was four of them, and then ran around the hall while Snape chased them. They\u2019ve just left,\u201d he whispered. Harry chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn. I can\u2019t believe I missed it,\u201d he said with a shake of his head. He grabbed a piece of toast, and began composing his letter to Sirius in his mind. A very successful morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThose darn Weasley twins!\u201d Severus raged, striding back and forth. Minerva hid a smile behind her hand, and Albus hadn\u2019t even bothered trying to hide his amusement. There was a knock on his office door. He wrenched it open to find Draco, accompanied by Dumb and Dumber. Just his luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d he growled. Draco paled.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was Potter! He\u2019s made polyjuice. He told me the other day!\u201d Draco said, his grey eyes bright and irritating. He was practically bouncing with energy. Severus rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to try to get Potter into trouble you may as well come up with a better lie!\u201d he hissed, and slammed the door shut in Draco\u2019s face. Bloody Weasleys! Bloody Malfoys! Bloody Potter!</p>\n<p>\u201cCome now Severus, there may be a hint of truth in what he was saying,\u201d Albus said. \u201cWeren\u2019t you telling me the other day that some boomslang skin had gone missing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if Potter could brew Polyjuice. Next you\u2019ll try to\u00a0tell me that Granger helped him! That rule abiding know it all wouldn\u2019t pull a prank to save her life,\u201d Severus growled. He clenched his fists and took a breath to calm himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want them punished!\u201d he hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong,\u201d Albus pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDisruption of a meal!\u201d Severus cried.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cFive points-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cFive! Fifty points from Gryffindor for disruptive behaviour,\u201d Severus said.</p>\n<p>Albus raised a brow. \u201cForty five points to Gryffindor for ingenuity. Now, that will be all,\u201d Albus said firmly.</p>\n<p>Severus sighed and collapsed into a chair. Bloody Gryffindors.</p>\n<p>Harry spent his first Christmas hols with Sirius, singing carols and eating mince pies, while plying Sirius with mulled wine. Drunk Sirius was the funniest thing he\u2019d ever seen. He kept shifting into Padfoot as he fell asleep, and Sirius could barely coordinate two legs, let alone Padfoot\u2019s four. Harry would douse him with water, and Padfoot would chase him around their cottage, crashing into walls and at one point running straight into a pane of glass he hadn\u2019t realised was there. As he fell back he shifted back into Sirius with a groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy nose!\u201d he cried, groping around for his wand. Harry had just kicked it under a sofa when there was a knock at the door. \u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius said, jumping up and then tripping over his own feet. Harry smirked, and opened the door. He recognised Remus Lupin from photographs, although he looked older and wearier.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello. I\u2019m Harry Potter,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Remus smiled. \u201cRemus Lupin. Call me Remus, or Moony, as I'm sure Sirius has told you to. It\u2019s wonderful to see you again after all this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoony!\u201d Sirius groaned. Harry beckoned him in.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time for Christmas dinner. Mimsy\u2019s setting the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re evil!\u201d Sirius said. \u201cHarry, where\u2019s my wand!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cHow\u00a0would I know?\u201d he asked innocently.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Sirius yelled. Harry ignored him. He led Remus past the lounge and up the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius decorated for you\u2026\u201d The room they\u2019d allocated was covered with reds and golds. Remus chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks wonderful,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Sirius, shall we?\u201d He placed down a briefcase, and they found Sirius lying on the floor, whinging about his bloody nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all Harry\u2019s fault!\u201d Sirius cried. Remus frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius!\u201d he admonished. \u201cYou can't\u00a0blame your twelve year old godson when it's you that's been drinking too much.\u201d Harry smirked at Sirius from behind Remus\u2019 back while Remus fixed Sirius up. Sirius narrowed his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can if he\u2019s laced my mulled wine with fire whiskey. I know you did it.,\u201d he hissed. Harry blinked, his green eyes innocent and wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s firewhiskey?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Remus flicked Sirius on the nose. \u201cBehave.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sat around the table, upon which sat a feast. It smelt delicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrackers!\u201d Sirius declared. Sirius and Remus held one, and Harry offered his to Mimsy, who squeaked in delight.</p>\n<p>BANG. Harry pulled his with Mimsy and the usual fireworks appeared. He gave her the crown, and placed the chocolate frog beside him. They exchanged a sly glance.</p>\n<p>BANG. Sirius\u2019 cracker was pulled, and red and green glitter exploded over him and Remus. They both spluttered. He turned to face them. Sirius wiped glitter away from his eyes, before turning to glare at Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it supposed to do that?\u201d Harry asked guilelessly. Every inch of them was covered. They shimmered as the moved. Sirius shook his head like a dog, and only managed to shake more glitter onto Remus.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius! I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Remus said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! It was Harry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame your innocent godson!\u201d Remus hissed. Harry kept a straight face, and exchanged a wink with Mimsy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly Sirius I\u2019m so disappointed in you,\u201d Harry said, shaking his head. He bit his lip to keep himself from laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cScourgify,\u201d Remus muttered, and the glitter poofed! and multiplied.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvanesco,\u201d Sirius said, and all of his glitter turned pink. Harry couldn\u2019t help it. He snorted, then spluttered with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin your faces,\u201d he chuckled. Both adults turned to face him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Remus said curiously. Suspicion crept into his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Sirius said.</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. \u201cMimsy?\u201d</p>\n<p>The house elf clicked her fingers and the glitter vanished. He held up his hand and she high fived him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Merlin, you\u2019ve corrupted the elf,\u201d Sirius groaned, while Remus looked resigned.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s two of them,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Christmas!\u201d Harry said in delight. They proceeded to have a\u00a0Christmas even better than Harry could have imagined.</p>\n<p>Back at school Harry happened upon a very curious diary. It absorbed ink and wrote back to the author, and Harry had brushed off a pesky\u00a0compulsion to continue writing, and never let it go. He remembered distinctly something that Arthur Weasley had said. \u2018Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can\u2019t see where it keeps its brain.\u2019 And the diary was certainly suspicious. He packaged it up, and sent it off to Sirius with a note, and thought nothing of it. So he was rather surprised by the emphatic and slightly deranged reply he received.</p>\n<p>A red letter hovered in the air before him.</p>\n<p>\u201cA howler!\u201d Ron said, almost in delight. \u201cBetter open it, or else it\u2019ll explode!\u201d Harry raised a brow, and opened it with the tip of his wand. He still remembered Mrs Weasley's scolding.</p>\n<p>\u201cHARRY JAMES POTTER.\u201d Sirius\u2019 voice boomed around the hall, which subsequently fell silent. \u201cWHERE DID YOU FIND THAT ITEM? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS? REPLY IMMEDIATELY, IMMEDIATELY, DO YOU HEAR ME, AND TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT IT!\u201d Harry blinked in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cTELL NOBODY!\u201d He rather felt writing a howler with that directive was something of an oxymoron.</p>\n<p>\u201cAND TO THOSE OF YOU BUGGERS WHO ARE LISTENING IN -PPHHHHHH.\u201d Sirius had blown a long and loud raspberry. Harry bit back a giggle. \u201cLove you Pronglet.\u201d And the letter disintegrated. Harry reckoned he could still hear echoes of it bouncing around in his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cAbout those Cannons.\u201d Ron grinned. Hermione glared at him with disapproval.</p>\n<p>\u201cI reckon they\u2019ve got a chance this season!\u201d Rom exclaimed, utterly oblivious to the silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\" Harry lied, and jump to his feet. \"I just remembered that I need to\u2026 urm\u2026 one sec.\u201d Harry sprinted out the hall, racing toward the Owlery. What on earth had he found?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you suppose that was about?\u201d Minerva asked, infringing upon the silence that surrounded his corner of the staff room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing good,\u201d Severus muttered as he marked the fifth years\u2019 homework. \u2018<em>Is there anything other than air inside your head, Johnson?\u2019</em>\u00a0he scrawled in blood red ink.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wee bit harsh.\u201d Minerva commented, having read over his shoulder. He set down the papers and narrowed his eyes at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you to come with me when I\u00a0go to confront Sirius Black about his rather curious howler to young Mr Potter,\u201d she replied calmly. Severus groaned, pinching the bridge of his snose.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d he mumbled, then louder, \u201cNo! Absolutely not. I\u2019ll go nowhere near that mutt. I want nothing to do with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you at all intrigued?\u201d</p>\n<p>He crossed his arms. \u201cIrrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Minerva cocked a brow, then smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDing,\u201d she said. Severus sighed, very loudly, in an attempt to get his frustration across to her. Her smile only grew wider, like that of the Cheshire cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome along now,\u201d she said, as if she was corralling a child. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lily would be interested in what \u2018dangerous item\u2019 her son had happened across.\u201d Severus glared at her, before snarling and getting to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine! As it seems to be the only way I can get you to shut up and go away,\u201d he hissed, and stalked off to get his outer robe. He chose to ignore Minerva\u2019s stifled snort of laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMinnie!\u201d Severus heard Black cry, and wondered how the man hadn\u2019t been slaughtered already. To his shock Minerva merely huffed. He could imagine the affectionate eye roll that accompanied it. Minerva stepped inside, and Black looked startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSnape,\u201d Black said, eyes flicking between the two of them. \u201cPlease, come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack,\u201d Severus replied, barely keeping the disdain from his voice. If Black could be civilized, well, so could he.</p>\n<p>He stiffly seated himself in the parlour of Grimmauld Place, and sat in silence while Minerva and Black exchanged pleasantries. Eventually, they got to the point.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just here for a social visit,\u201d Black observed.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Severus replied, biting back further vitriol. Black grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about that howler, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Black shook his head. \u201cI must admit\u2026 I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly when I sent it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is quite evident... Well? Out with it! What dangerous item had Harry encountered?\u201d Minerva demanded. Black, for the first time in his entire life, looked entirely serious. Severus was well aware of the irony. He contemplated the both of them, his eyes narrowed as they settled upon Severus.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you both be willing to take a vow not to wilfully disclose this information to another person without my permission?\u201d Black asked. Severus raised a brow, but agreed. Black had been a formidable Auror, even in his youth, loathe as Severus was to admit it. He wouldn\u2019t ask such lightly.</p>\n<p>Once they had taken their vow, Black exited the room, and returned with a safe. He tapped it, muttering a password, then dripped blood onto it before it opened; a decidedly dark ward that Severus was reluctantly impressed by. From within Black withdrew an innocuous black book.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the diary of Tom Marvolo Riddle\u2026 and I also believe it to be his horcrux.\u201d</p>\n<p>Minerva paled, but Severus merely frowned. He\u2019d heard of neither.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d he hissed, when the both looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTom Marvolo Riddle\u2026 that\u2019s a name I\u2019ve not heard in a long while,\u201d Minerva said quietly. \u201cI suppose it is likely easier to show you\u2026\u201d She traced the name in the air, so that the letters were burning as she wrote them.</p>\n<p>TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE</p>\n<p>Then, with a flick, the letters began to move, rearranging themselves.</p>\n<p>I AM LORD VOLDEMORT</p>\n<p>Severus recoiled, looking at the diary in horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dark Lord\u2019s diary,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d Black said. \u201cA horcrux is a dark object that contains a piece of its owner\u2019s soul, torn apart through murder.\u201d Silver eyes met his own. \u201cIn theory, even if the body were destroyed, the soul would live on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus wanted to flee, to leave the room, to storm back to Hogwarts and lock himself away. He didn\u2019t want to be in the same country as part of the Dark Lord\u2019s soul, let alone the same room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may be interested to know that the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, Tom Riddle was a student at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not saying\u2026\u201d Minerva said, covering her mouth with her shaking hand. \u201cThis diary\u2026 is responsible?\u201d</p>\n<p>Black nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cA horcrux is a piece of human soul. It wants a body, to be let free. It was likely possessing a child. I suppose we\u2019re lucky that Harry found it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus snorted. \u201cLuck! Luck has nothing to do with it! That boy is a magnet for trouble.\u201d Black glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look! You know it\u2019s true!\u201d Black sighed, looking his age.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Only Harry would find a part of You Know Who\u2019s soul and send it to me in the post.\u201d Black huffed a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that is what is keeping him alive, then why haven\u2019t you destroyed it?\u201d Minerva exclaimed, having recovered from her shock. Black grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried! Nothing I can do will destroy it. I\u2019ve tried to burn it, to tear it apart, curse it! Nothing!\u201d Black lamented. Severus eyed the diary. It sat on the table, mocking him in its innocent appearance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Severus said, even as he shied away from it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d Black growled. Severus ignored him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there somewhere any backlash can be contained?\u201d he asked instead. Black huffed, but led him to a ritual room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStay back,\u201d Severus warned them. He looked at the diary, and thought of his pain when he had learned Lily was to die, the feeling of betrayal, of hatred toward his former master, his utter loathing of the Dark Lord. His hands shook as he raised his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d The room was lit up in a flash of green light. The diary hissed where the curse struck it, and black smoke poured out, writhing and screaming, before doubling in on itself.</p>\n<p>BANG. The diary exploded, throwing him into the wall. His vision blurred, and spots of light swam before his eyes. His ears were ringing as he scrambled to his feet, and stalked over to the remains of the diary. It was just burnt paper and ash. He kicked it, and the remains disintegrated.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d he muttered, pushing past Black. He couldn\u2019t bear to look at Minerva, not now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus,\u201d she called out. He spun to face her, glaring at her shoes. She placed a hand upon his arm. \u201cWell done,\u201d she said quietly. He glanced up, but none of the revulsion he imagined was in her face, just sadness. He nodded sharply, and stalked out the house. He needed a firewhiskey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master master master master.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Harry groaned and rolled over in his bed. He was back in school for the spring term, unfortunately. It was also the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What is it Baneofallrodents? I\u2019m trying to sleep.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMaster! I have found the King Snake.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0</em>Harry grumbled</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There is another snake, the King Snake.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe King Snake?\u201d \u00a0</em>Harry rolled over. \u201c<em>Not now,\u201d </em>he hissed, and fell back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Exam season was nearing. Half the school was mad with revision fever, and Hermione had reached new levels of crazy. He was conscripted into studying every spare second, and one time she\u2019d even followed him into the toilet. Harry had taken to hiding from her in the most unusual of places, which is how he'd ended up under Lockhart\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>The office had been empty. Unfortunately, Lockhart followed him in moments later.</p>\n<p>His shoes were gold velvet, and twinkled as he walked. Harry could only see the bottom half of his robe, and it was cream, embroidered with portraits of Lockhart in golden thread around the edges, and they waved at Harry, beaming wildly. Lockhart was standing at his desk, humming Madonna\u2019s \u2018Like A Virgin\u2019 to himself. Harry stuck a fist in his mouth to prevent himself from laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMirror mirror, on the wall, who\u2019s the fairest of them all?\u201d Lockhart suddenly sang.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, you, of course, you handsome scallywag,\u201d Lockhart continued in a lower voice. Harry bit down so hard he tasted blood. \u201cIf only I wasn\u2019t a mirror\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh please, you flatter me!\u201d Lockhart said in his usual voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all. Your hair is like spun gold, and your teeth are as white as pearls and shine like diamonds!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry choked upon his spit, and Lockhart stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he called, and almost tripped over his shoes as he spun. Harry glanced at the door, but there was no way he\u2019d make it without being seen.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Baneofallrodents. Help!\u201d \u00a0</em>Harry hissed. Baneofallrodents unfurled herself from Harry\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Open,\u201d </em>she hissed sleepily, before curling back up.</p>\n<p>To Harry\u2019s surprise, the stone wall began unfolding, sliding back like the bricks at the entrance to Diagon Alley. Harry glanced up at Lockhart, who was brandishing his wand at the door, oblivious to the drama behind him, and scrambled through it. \u201c<em>Close!\u201d</em> The stones moved again, and as the last one fitted into the wall, Harry was left in darkness.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked, but his vision didn\u2019t clear. He scrambled for his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cLumos.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slime dripped from the ceiling of the tunnel Harry found himself in, joining the muck the covered the floor. Harry sniffed, and regretted it as the stench of waste filled the air.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>This better not be a sewer,\u201d</em> Harry growled. Baneofallrodents declined to reply, only furthering Harry\u2019s suspicions. He picked a direction, and began walking.</p>\n<p>As Harry walked, the tunnel began steeping down, trickles of water preceding him like a small filthy brook. He muttered the parseltongue for \u2018open\u2019 every couple of steps, but no exit appeared. Down and down he walked, and the further he walked, the colder it got. Occasionally things crunched beneath his feet, but the only time he\u2019d glanced down he\u2019d seen the bones of a rodent long gone from this world. Harry didn\u2019t look down again.</p>\n<p>Occasionally the tunnel changed direction, but never at sharp angle. It meandered like a river, and the stone walls were smooth as if water, or some other substance had eroded them. The tunnel itself was circular, more like an enormous pipe, and Harry hoped he wasn\u2019t about to be washed into the Black Lake.</p>\n<p>The tunnel got steeper, and Harry seriously considered turning back. Surely Lockhart must have left his office by now? But his curiosity had been piqued, and he never had been one to go back on a challenge. He was bracing his hands against the walls in an attempt to keep his balance, but really, when it happened, he should have realise that it would have been inevitable.</p>\n<p>He slipped.</p>\n<p>\u201cAAAAHH!\u201d Harry yelled as he slid down the pipe like it was a disgusting water slide. He\u2019d dropped his wand when he\u2019d fallen, and all he could do was brace his head as he shot down the tunnel, picking up speed until the drop was almost vertical. He could see nothing but darkness ahead.</p>\n<p>A crunch of bones broke his fall. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t think they were his own. Harry moaned, not moving, his glasses gripped so tightly in his hand they\u2019d broken in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he hissed as something landed on his face. He blinked, peering at the shining tip\u2026 of his wand!</p>\n<p>\u201cReparo,\u201d he muttered, and slid his fixed glasses on.</p>\n<p>If anything, the room he was in was even creepier than the tunnel. He couldn\u2019t see the floor for all the skeletons that lay on it. What had once been green tile on the walls was now covered in black mould. The only source of light was his wand tip, throwing eerie shadows about the room.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master\u2026!\u201d </em>Baneofallrodents slid out the tunnel. Harry snatched her out the air with lightning quick reflexes honed by Quidditch. She curled so tightly around his neck he almost couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Too fast,\u201d</em>\u00a0she scolded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the hell am I?\u201d Harry muttered, before catching sight of a pillar, on which a stone serpent was curled. He snapped his eyes shut, heart rate, which had only just recovered, rocketing sky high once again. A half-remembered dream flashed before his eyes\u2026 Baneofallrodents talking about a \u2018King Snake\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Baneofallrodents. Where, exactly, did you find the\u2026\u201d </em>He choked over the word. Apparently, Basilisk didn\u2019t translate into Parseltongue well. \u201c<em>The\u2026basil\u2026 lisp?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMaster?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The bastille licks! The battle lists! Fuck. The basil licks!\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cAre you well, master?\u201d</em> Harry grimaced. He opened one eye, then the other, preparing to snap them shut at the first sign of movement.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The King Snake?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHere, Master!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Great. Harry was stuck in the Chamber of Secrets, with Salazar Slytherin\u2019s hungry basilisk on the loose. And, judging by the tunnel Harry had just tumbled down\u2026 it was enormous.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It\u2019s very friendly, master,\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents said. Somehow, that didn\u2019t reassure Harry one bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Severus was minding his own business, patrolling the first floor, definitely not thinking about the \u2018horcrux\u2019 he\u2019d destroyed a few weeks ago, when he caught sight of an irate Lockhart. He promptly turned on one foot and took off in the other direction. Unfortunately, it seemed lady luck was not on his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus! Severus! Just the man I was after.\u201d Lockhart\u2019s usually pristine hair was mussed, and there was a wild look in his eye. Severus bit back a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was someone hiding in my office!\u201d Lockhart proclaimed. Severus reluctantly followed the man in. Every single portrait was scanning the room, although one slipped him a wink. He raised his wand in warning and it hurriedly turned away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey escaped out a hole in the wall! Right there.\u201d Lockhart pointed halfway up the wall. Severus tapped it with his wand. It was stone, a foot deep, as to be expected for a castle. There was nothing magical about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow big was the\u2026 hole in the wall?\u201d Severus asked, narrowing his eyes at Lockhart. Lockhart waved his arms around wildly. Severus raised a brow. Lockhart eventually settled upon a holding his hands about a foot apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a person hiding in your office, who escaped through a hole in the wall the size of a shoe box that was at least a meter off the ground, all while you were present\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it entirely! Of course, I had my back turned when they escaped, but they must have been hiding under my desk,\u201d Lockhart agreed with a beam. \"Obviously they were too cowardly to face me.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere they, perhaps, invisible, as well?\u201d Severus drawled. Lockhart failed to notice the danger, and continued to blather on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course, you\u2019re completely right! How on earth will we find the culprit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is beyond me. Of course, you are the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher\u2026 are you not? Shouldn\u2019t finding people versed in the art of espionage be your speciality?\u201d Severus smirked as Lockhart paled, and swept out the room before he could hear a single word more.</p>\n<p>Draco fell into step beside him. Damn his luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was Potter,\u201d Draco hissed, glancing about in suspicion. \u201cI saw him go in there, and he never came out!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Severus growled, and Draco took a step back. \u201cFirst dragons, then polyjuice, now this! Making up lies about Potter will get you nowhere! Get out of my sight.\u201d Draco scarpered.</p>\n<p>\u201cTen points from Gryffindor,\u201d Severus muttered as he walked past the House point hourglasses, and was rewarded by a groan of despair from a student in a red and gold tie as they watched the rubies trickle down. Severus smirked, his mood lifted. Now if only to catch Potter actually breaking the rules\u2026 that would be the cherry on top.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How do we get out of here?\u201d</em> Harry asked Baneofallrodents.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Through that door,\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents nodded toward a circular wooden door. It was covered by engravings of snakes, and several years\u2019 worth of grime.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Harry grumbled. \u201c<em>Open.\u201d</em> Nothing happened. \u201c<em>Open up. King Snake. Salazar. Salazar Slytherin.\u201d</em> The snakes on the door came to life, and one by one slithered off the doorway, unlocking with several ominous snicks. The door creaked open. Harry watched warily for even a flicker of movement that might suggest there was an enormous basilisk waiting to petrify him with its gaze, or just eat him, and stepped through.</p>\n<p>On the other side was a long, dimly lit chamber. Stone pillars entwined with serpents towered above him, the ceiling lost in darkness. There was an occasional plop of dripping water, and a rasping noise that echoed, amplified by the vast space.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Who dares enter Salazar Slytherin\u2019s sacred study?\u201d </em>a low voice hissed. Harry froze, jamming his eyes shut, heart pounding in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hello Sally! It\u2019s Baneofallrodents, and my human.\u201d </em>There was a long pause.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh hey Baneofallrodents. Did you bring me any snacks?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Harry burst into hysterical laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What\u2019s wrong with your human?\u201d \u00a0</em>the basilisk \u2013 Sally \u2013 asked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>He\u2019s always like this.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It took Harry several moments to catch his breath. Eventually he got a hold of himself, and nodded in the direction of the voice.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHello Sally,\u201d </em>Harry hissed. \u201c<em>My name is Hassa.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI call him master.\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents informed Sally.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My only master is Salazar Slytherin, and his heirs. Hassa will suffice,\u201d</em> Sally hissed. \u201c<em>You may open your eyes, little human. Mine are shielded and will not harm you.\u201d</em> Harry opened his eyes, and stared at the floor. Slowly, he raised gaze to first take in Sally\u2019s enormous length, easily thirty feet in length, her scales a vivid iridescent green. He forced his eye up further, warily noting Sally\u2019s teeth, as long as any sword. Then, he met her eyes.</p>\n<p>He could immediately see that there was a thin veil over them, and he bowed without a thought. He\u2019d met a basilisk\u2019s gaze and survived!</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You are magnificent,\u201d</em>\u00a0he said honestly. And terrifying, he added in the privacy of his own mind.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThank you, little human. Next time you come, you may bring me snacks.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d </em>Harry wondered what a basilisk liked to snack on. \u201c<em>Why did you attack those children?\u201d</em> Harry asked cautiously. Sally roared and he immediately flinched back.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I was commanded by Slytherin\u2019s heir. I did not kill them. They will recover!\u201d</em> Harry bowed again.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Of course. My apologies.\u201d</em> Sally\u2019s tail flicked, and then moved slowly toward him. Harry kept very still. Sally wrapped it around him, like it was another snake.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Slytherin\u2019s heir has not come in a long time. All is well,\u201d</em>\u00a0she soothed him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I told you she was friendly.\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents hissed from where she was hidden beneath Sally\u2019s tail.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It was lovely to meet you, Sally, but I\u2019m afraid my friends are probably missing me. Is there any way for me to get out of here?\u201d</em> Harry asked the thought that had been plaguing his mind since he\u2019d fallen down the tunnel. He was hungry. Sally hissed in what sounded like amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Come.\u201d</em> He followed her through another set of tunnels, until they reached a pipe like the one he\u2019d fallen down. \u201c<em>Perch on my head, and I shall lift you up.\u201d</em> Harry cautiously climbed up her frame, and Sally lifted them up through the tunnel.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Open</em>.\u201d Harry scrambled onto a tiled floor. He turned back to look Sally in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d someone shrieked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Thank you,\u201d </em>he hissed. Sally disappeared back down. \u201c<em>Close.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHarry! Was that a basilisk?\u201d Hermione yelled. Harry grinned sheepishly at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s called Sally. We\u2019re friends now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t befriend a basilisk!\u201d Hermione exclaimed. Harry shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a crack fic, Hermione. It\u2019s expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hermione said, her brow wrinkled. Harry shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear. Oh, look! A stack of books!\u201d Hermine perked up, and her nose flared, like a hound with a scent.</p>\n<p>\u201cBooks?\u201d She swivelled around and broke the sound barrier to reach the pile of tomes upon the floor next to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must have dropped them.\u201d He helped her pick them up. A glance around showed that he was in a bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my! A boy in a girl\u2019s bathroom! You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Moaning Myrtle floated out of a toilet and Harry bit back a sigh. At least that answered the question of which bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was looking for you,\u201d Harry lied. \u201cI heard that there was a beautiful ghost haunting one of the bathrooms, and I just had to see for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my!\u201d Myrtle moaned. She blushed, and flew into the toilet, splashing water everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fiend, Harry Potter!\u201d Hermione cried with a huff, flicking water out of her eyes, and stalked out of the room. Harry grinned, and trailed after her, winking at Malfoy who was gawping at them as they left the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir! Potter just come out of a girls\u2019 toilet! A <em>girls\u2019</em> toilet!\u201d Draco cried. Severus hit him with a silencing charm, and walked away. Someone would remove it\u2026 at some point. Wouldn\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>He continued on his way to the Headmaster\u2019s office. The gargoyle stepped aside after he snapped out the password. \u201cAcid pops.\u201d Minerva and Black were already waiting for him.</p>\n<p>Albus was sitting at his desk, looking omniscient as always, stroking his beard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell Severus, this is an unexpected surprise. I must I never thought I\u2019d see the day that you would voluntarily spend time in close proximity to Sirius. Lemon drop, anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your nonsense Albus!\u201d Minerva snapped, and wacked Albus over the head with her wand. \u201cI\u2019ve just about had enough of your foolish behaviour lately.\u201d Severus hid a smirk as Black gaped. Albus merely blinked in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, Minerva,\u201d Albus said, although he seemed unsure as to what he was apologising for.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry found this in a girls\u2019 toilet,\u201d Black said, and placed the remains of the horcrux diary on the table. Albus\u2019 grandfatherly facade vanished in an instant. \u201cIt was a horcrux, and we think it was responsible for possessing a child and opening the Chamber of Secrets.\u201d Albus began casting several diagnostic spells, a frown firmly fixed upon his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I would like to know is how the wards failed to detect such a dark device!\u201d Minerva growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlas, of late the Board of Governors has refused to allow me to update the wards, and as such, they are falling into disrepair. We don\u2019t have the budget for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a load of bullshit,\u201d Black said, echoing Severus\u2019 thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous!\u201d Minerva exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe Lucius is likely to have had a hand in this,\u201d Severus murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally\u2026\u201d Black muttered, then an evil grin spread over his face. \u201cWell, I suppose we\u2019ll just have to beat him at his own game. Leave this to me.\u201d Severus shuddered as Black stalked out of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry seems to be a positive influence on him,\u201d Minerva remarked fondly. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Albus said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose Black is minutely less odious than he was in his youth,\u201d Severus allowed.</p>\n<p>Harry snatched up a copy of the Prophet at breakfast, and promptly choked on his pumpkin juice.</p>\n<p>\n<em>BOY WHO LIVED SAVES THE DAY ONCE MORE</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>HOGWARTS BOARD OF GOVERNORS ENDANGERING STUDENTS</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>CURSED OBJECT FOUND AND DESTROYED</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Over the course of this academic year something terrifying has been stalking our students in the very halls we have all once called home; Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Children have been petrified: literally! Ominous messages written in red paint were displayed upon the walls for all to see, claiming the Chamber of Secrets had opened once more.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The origin of these terrible tragedies was a cursed object that was attacking students. Luckily, one clever and brave child faced down the cursed device, and recognised it for what it truly was! Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, wisely sent the cursed object away from Hogwarts and into the care of his guardian, Lord Black, who promptly destroyed it, thus ending the reign of terror.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But how, you may ask, did the object enter Hogwarts in the first place? Hogwarts, allegedly the safest place in Britain has not had its wards renewed for nearly ten years! This reporter is scandalised to discover that the Hogwarts Board of Governors has refused to pay for curse breakers to renew the ward schemes, claiming budgetary deficiencies despite the Headmaster\u2019s yearly requests.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I ask you, wise and caring wizarding folk: would you put a price upon the safety of our children? </em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry cackled aloud, and several classmates slid further down the benches to get away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is shocking!\u201d Hermione exclaimed, reading the paper over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>A flurry of ginger hair and freckles barrelled into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you thank you thank you!\u201d Ginny Weasley cried, hugging him so tight he could barely breath. Then she blushed bright red and sprinted out of the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s totally mad,\u201d Ron commented around a mouthful of food, baring the mush for all to see. Harry exchanged a grimace with Hermione.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady Potter?\u201d Wood called. Harry stood up and saluted him. Time for the final Quidditch match of the year.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir, captain sir!\u201d he cried, and followed the Gryffindor team toward the changing rooms. Hopefully he\u2019d be able to avoid any rogue bludgers or bucking brooms.</p>\n<p>They were playing Ravenclaw today, and the Gryffindor team was frankly superior. Fred and George were menaces on brooms, the three female chases were ruthless and fast, Wood was so determined to win he would block the quaffle with his face if he had to, and all that was left for Harry to do was stop the Ravenclaw seeker, Chang, from getting the snitch.</p>\n<p>Harry was flying loop the loops when he saw the snitch. It was hovering by Chang\u2019s left ear. If she turned even slightly, she\u2019d immediately see it. So, Harry performed the most logical action that he could think of.</p>\n<p>\u201cWooo!\u201d he yelled, tilting his broom forward and accelerating toward the ground. He could hear shouts of glee as the Gryffindors thought he\u2019d seen the snitch. He shot past the Ravenclaw keeper, causing him to spin wildly on his broom.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi!\u201d he yelled, but Harry was gone. The ground was drawing nearer and nearer. One glance was all it took to note that Chang was hot on his heels, and he abruptly drew up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d he said. She stopped next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you catch it?\u201d she asked, bemused as the game continued playing.</p>\n<p>\u201cCatch what?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>She stared at him. \u201cThe snitch\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry waved his empty hands at her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chang narrowed her eyes. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d she hissed, and flew away. Harry grinned. He glanced about the field, noting the snitch had moved once more.</p>\n<p>There!</p>\n<p>It was hiding behind the Gryffindor goals. He casually flew up over the other players, starting a loop of the pitch. When he deemed that he was sufficiently close he spun, speeding toward the tiny golden ball. The snitch ducked and dived but Harry was determined, weaving in and out of the goals and colliding with a quaffle that had made it past Wood. Harry dove, this time for real, getting closer and closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d He snatched it out of the air, holding it up for all to see, and the stands erupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter has caught the snitch, Gryffindor win, 260 \u2013 80! What a brilliant game that was, brought to you by the handsome Lee Jordan, and let me tell you that we all know who the real star player is! Angelina, light of my life, Quidditch Queen and chaser supreme, will you go to Hogsmede with me?\u201d Lee boomed over the speaker phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cJordan!\u201d McGonagall could be heard over the sound of laughter. Angelina hovered in mid-air, posing thoughtfully. Students stamped their feet in the stands as they waited for her to make up her mind. Finally, she waved at the commentary booth and held out both hands, thumbs up. The crowd cheered, even the mopey looking Ravenclaws.</p>\n<p>Harry swooped down to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood game Harrikins!\u201d twin one cried.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent flying!\u201d twin two agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody brilliant!\u201d Ron said around a mouthful of unknown edible substance. Harry beamed as Gryffindor stormed the pitch, lifting him onto their shoulders. Now all he had to do was get through the end of term exams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWeasley, what would I get if I added powdered gundleroot to a shrinking concoction?\u201d Weasley gaped at him, and Severus rolled his eyes. \u201cNothing to say? I suppose it was optimistic to hope for an intelligent response.\u201d He spun to face the Slytherin side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Malfoy?\u201d Draco glared at him, and crossed his arms. Severus frowned. Draco could usually be counted upon to answer. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco opened his mouth to speak, and nothing came out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone silenced him, sir, and no one can remove it,\u201d Greengrass explained.</p>\n<p>Severus wondered if he should feel guilty for leaving Draco silenced for nearly a week, but found it rather amusing that none of the older students had felt inclined to help.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout time!\u201d Draco hissed, and every face in the room fell as he regained his voice. Not even a single Slytherin seemed pleased that he could speak once more. \u201cAnd it would explode\u2026 obviously.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFive points to Slytherin,\u201d Severus awarded. Draco might have been a little twerp, but at least he knew his potions.</p>\n<p>Harry flopped onto a seat on the Hogwarts Express, feeling like he been runover by a dragon.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat potions exam was vicious,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t remember if I included the fifth step in creating a forgetfulness potion!\u201d Hermione worried, rifling through a book.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh,\u201d Ron said. \u201cAt least they\u2019re over now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were done. It was end of term, they\u2019d finished exams, and Harry was about to spend his first summer holiday with Sirius. He couldn\u2019t wait.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a quicker way to get back to London than this?\u201d he complained. Hermione opened her mouth to speak, but surprisingly it was Ron who answered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Knight Bus will take you anywhere really fast, but not everyone would fit on it. Mum used it a lot when we were kids. You just raise your wand, and think of trying to get somewhere.\u201d Ron shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s a right joke though, though I was gonna die last time I was on it. Not worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry huffed. \u201cStupid magical transportation.\u201d Baneofallrodents stroked his cheek with her tail to soothe him.</p>\n<p>The mirror in his pocket buzzed, and Harry withdrew it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius?\u201d His godfather was looking entirely too panicked for anything good.</p>\n<p>\u201cPettigrew\u2019s escaped!\u201d Sirius growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, oh no, oh no!\u201d Ron shrieked. \u201cHe\u2019s coming for me! After all this time sleeping in my bed, he\u2019s coming for me again, oh no, what am I going-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStupefy,\u201d Harry muttered, and Ron collapsed to the floor. \u201cPlease, Sirius, continue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019 lips twitched in what Harry thought was amusement. \u201cDid you just stun Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I say no, will you believe me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius grinned. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to.\u201d Hermione was quietly snickering in the corner. She levitated Ron onto a seat so that he was slumped over \u2018asleep\u2019. \u201cNow, be on your guard when you get off the train. Remus and I will be waiting for you under the sign for the platform, so come straight over, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d Harry said, and slid the mirror away. Hermione picked up a book, and Harry grabbed one of his own, hoping he\u2019d be able to enjoy a peaceful ride back to London before becoming immersed in the chaos of living with Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter!\u201d Malfoy spat, barging unannounced into their carriage. Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re busy right now, Malfoy, so just go away.\u201d He made a shooing motion with his hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll assume that whatever it was that you came in to say was suitably witty and your goons cackled in amusement while I flushed with indignant embarrassment and rage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-what?\u201d Malfoy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes yes, you\u2019re very scary, off you pop now.\u201d Harry flicked his wand and a blast of wind blew Malfoy out of the room and into the corridor, slamming the door shut behind him. \u201cColloportus,\u201d Harry muttered and the lock clicked shut. The door knob rattled several times, but eventually Malfoy stalked away.</p>\n<p>Hermione gave him an appraising look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really improved with your studies lately.\u201d Harry flushed. \u201cWere you holding back before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled weakly. \u201cWell. I wouldn\u2019t say holding back\u2026 exactly,\u201d he hedged.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry James Potter!\u201d Hermione growled, and Harry was lectured about academic achievement and reaching his potential all the way to Kings Cross. He even considered waking Ron up, but realised that just meant two of them would have to suffer. He then considered jumping out of the carriage window, but figured he was just making Voldemort\u2019s job easy for him.</p>\n<p>By the time they reached the station Harry was more than ready to get off the train. Ron had woken up halfway through the rant and was curled up in a corner with his hands over his ears, whimpering. Harry wasn\u2019t far from that state himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you in a couple weeks!\u201d Harry yelled, and grabbed his trunk, running off the train.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius, thank Merlin, you have to save me!\u201d he cried as he almost instantly ran into his godfather. Sirius sneered and Harry frowned. \u201cWait-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cMorsmordre!\u201d Sirius cried, pressing a scarf to Harry\u2019s neck. Immediately it felt as if something had hooked about his navel and yanked. Harry yelled as he was pulled through space, and he landed on the ground with a thud. He rolled with the movement and came up with his wand in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Sirius,\u201d Harry said. Polyjuice, perhaps? Sirius\u2019 doppelganger grinned, and licked his lips. A jet of light flew from his wand and Harry ducked, hiding behind a massive stone. As Harry glanced about he realised he was in a graveyard, nowhere he\u2019d ever been before.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, there was a burst of pain on his forehead and Harry screamed, clutching his scar.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master?\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents hissed. Harry fell forward and curled up on the ground. The pain was fading but it was still there, as if his scar was being created anew, splitting his skull apart.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Run and hide,\u201d</em>\u00a0he replied through gritted teeth and she slithered away.</p>\n<p>His wand was snatched from his grasp, and Harry was bound to a stone angel. He squirmed, but the ropes only tightened, almost choking him. A cauldron bubbled before him and Pettigrew approached, holding something in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d the Sirius doppelganger cried, and clutched his leg. \u201cA fucking snake bit me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are only adders and grass snakes in Britain,\u201d a sibilant voice hissed from the bundle in Pettigrew\u2019s arms, and if Harry hadn\u2019t guessed it was Voldemort before, he knew now for certain. \u201cYou will survive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore the blinding pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cEep!\u201d Pettigrew shrieked. \u201cIt bit me too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop this nonsense!\u201d Voldemort roared, although as he was currently inhabiting the body of a small child it was more of a squeak. \u201cIgnore the bites, and return me to my former glory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, master,\u201d the Death Eaters replied and bowed to Babymort, then deposited him in the cauldron. Harry really hoped Babymort drowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cBone of the father, unknowingly given,\u201d Pettigrew rasped, and a thin trickle of bone rose from the ground and flew into the cauldron.</p>\n<p>\u201cFlesh of the servant, willingly given.\u201d Pettigrew raised a knife, and his own hand, and sliced it off. Harry flinched and looked away from the bloody stump.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlood of the enemy, forcibly taken.\u201d Pettigrew dug the knife into Harry\u2019s arm, even as his own fingers trembled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI give it freely!\u201d Harry cried, but Pettigrew merely snarled at him, dripping the blood into the cauldron. Immediately it began to boil.</p>\n<p>The Sirius doppelganger was swaying on his feet, and Pettigrew had already collapsed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Baneofallrodents, get my wand!\u201d</em> Out of the shadows Baneofallrodents appeared. She tripped the doppelganger, then wrapped her tail around Harry\u2019s wand and slithered over to him. Harry grabbed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDiffindo.\u201d He cut the ropes and scooped Baneofallrodents up. While he\u2019d been planning his escape, Voldemort\u2019s body had been forming from the cauldron.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobe me,\u201d Voldemort demanded. Harry sprinted away toward the nearest country path. \u201cWormtail? Barty! POTTER!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry raised his wand. \u201cThe Knight Bus!\u201d he yelled, hoping it would work.</p>\n<p>With a loud honk an enormous purple double decker bus appeared from out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the stranded-\u201c</p>\n<p>Harry leapt on board. \u201cGo! Go! Go! He\u2019s trying to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The conductor blinked, looking up from the notecard he was reciting from.</p>\n<p>\u201cWut?\u201d A flash of red light flew toward them. Harry ducked and it crashed into the seat behind him, which shrivelled and curled in on itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh bloody \u2018ell, go Ernie go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it away Ern!\u201d Was that a talking skull?</p>\n<p>BANG.</p>\n<p>Harry was thrown to the floor as the bus shot forward.</p>\n<p>The conductor sniffed. \u201cAs I was sayin\u2019. Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be yer conductor for this evenin\u2019,\u201d he said in a nasal voice. \u201cNow, where is it that yer goin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. \u201cMinistry of Magic, please.\u201d He suddenly realised that his mirror was buzzing frantically, and had been for some time now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius.\u201d Sirius\u2019 eyes were wild, but a massive grin split across his face when Harry answered.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry! Oh Harry, thank Merlin you\u2019re all right!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grimaced. \u201cRelatively... I was kidnapped! I\u2019m on the Knight Bus to the Ministry. Shall I meet you there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius nodded. \u201cI\u2019m there already!\u201d</p>\n<p>They jerked to a stop, and Harry handed over payment. He sprinted off the bus and into Sirius\u2019 arms. Sirius squeezed him tight, and Harry hugged back.\u00a0It felt like home.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe now,\u201d Sirius muttered and patted Harry on the head. Harry took a deep breath and disentangled himself. Behind Sirius was a massive group of people including the Minister for Magic, Dumbledore, Snape, and the Weasleys.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Potter,\u201d said a woman Harry didn\u2019t recognise, wearing a monocle and a stern look upon her face. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to hear what happened to you. My office is just inside the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, excellent idea Amelia,\u201d Minister Fudge said. Harry realised\u00a0that she must be Amelia Bones, Director of the DMLE. He nodded. Sirius and Dumbledore followed hot on their heels.</p>\n<p>Director Bones\u2019 office was a tight fit, but Dumbledore conjured enough chairs for everyone. She called for a healer, and St. Mungo\u2019s sent one right over. Harry\u2019s arm was healed, and he was given a blood replenisher. Finally, they were all settled, and she gave him an expectant look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right Harry,\u201d Sirius whispered. \u201cJust take your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, quietly, Harry regaled his tail.</p>\n<p>\u201cCodswallop!\u201d Fudge announced at the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you accusing the Heir of House Black and House Potter of lying?\u201d Sirius hissed.</p>\n<p>Fudge gulped. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true! He can\u2019t be back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I inspect your memory?\u201d Director Bones asked, ignoring their arguement. Harry nodded, and tilted his head. She withdrew a silvery stream of liquid from his mind and placed it into a vial.</p>\n<p>\u201cI refuse to believe You Know Who is back!\u201d Fudge cried.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might not be,\u201d Harry spoke up. Fudge gazed at him, an expectant look upon his face. \u201cIt was definitely him, but my snake had bitten both Pettigrew and Barty, that\u2019s why they collapsed. She\u2019s an Eastern Brown Snake, and the venom is quite fatal.\u201d Baneofallrodents chose that moment to poke her head out from underneath his shirt and Fudge jumped back in surprise, nearly toppling to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>They tasted like rotten rodents.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cPettigrew used his hand to regenerate Voldemort\u2026 he may have passed the poison in his blood stream onto Voldemort.\u201d Director Bones gave both him and Baneofallrodents an appraising look.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go, Minister. Perhaps we should put the Aurors on high alert, just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fudge huffed. \u201cDo as you wish,\u201d he snarled. \u201cBut I will not believe that You Know Who is back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced at Sirius and raised his brows. Sirius rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Heir, Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was still kidnapped. So, regardless of whether You Know Who is back, we need better security. The public will think you wise for putting precautions in place,\u201d Sirius said. Fudge nodded, his forehead creased\u00a0into a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, the public will think that won\u2019t they... Yes, Amelia, put the Aurors on high alert. We cannot have an incident like this happen again!\u201d Fudge bid them all good day, and stormed out of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on Harry,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cTime to go home. May we use your floo?\u201d Director Bones nodded, a frown upon her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDark times are upon us,\u201d she muttered. \u201cStay safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first time in eleven years Severus felt something that chilled him to the bone.</p>\n<p>His mark was burning.</p>\n<p>Harry ambled down the stairs for breakfast, Baneofallrodents curled around his waist. She refused to leave him alone since his kidnapping. He wasn\u2019t going to object. She had likely saved his life.</p>\n<p>Mimsy had cooked pancakes for breakfast, and Harry tucked in. There were loads left, and he realised he must have beaten Sirius to the table, an unusual set of circumstances. There was a slam of a door, and Harry grinned. He hoped into the pantry, pulling the door shut behind him. He\u2019d wait until Sirius was sitting down, then jump out and surprise him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, take a seat,\u201d Sirius said, and Harry froze. \u201cCoffee, tea, anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have tea, milk, two sugars,\u201d Dumbledore said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack coffee,\u201d Snape snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoffee for me as well, thank you Sirius,\u201d McGonagall said. Harry debated his options. Jump out, or listen to them?</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Severus, what\u2019s your report?\u201d The decision had been made for him. How could Harry resist such an enticing invitation to eavesdrop?</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dark Lord called me two days ago. Both Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr were dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrouch Jr?\u201d McGonagall exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dark Lord did not see fit to elucidate me on the means of his survival and escape of Azkaban, and it is currently irrelevant,\u201d Snape drawled. \u201cI believe Potter\u2019s snake poisoned them both, and the Dark Lord too. However, Nagini\u2019s venom was used in the Regeneration Potion, so he has a small immunity to poisons, which is why his body has not entirely deteriorated. He believes Pettigrew screwed up the ritual, and the fumes from the potion killed him and Crouch. Obviously, I have not disabused him of that notion. I have been providing him with various potions, but none of them should counter the venom, and so he will remain weak. He has called no one else to him, but Lucius is getting suspicious as the Mark has darkened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cServes the wanker right,\u201d Sirius growled. \u201cTeach him to kidnap my godson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned. Go Sirius!</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Albus, are you finally going to tell us your ideas on the remaining horcruxes?\u201d McGonagall said. Harry frowned. What on earth was a horcrux? Whatever it was, it couldn\u2019t be good.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow Minerva, it is essential that Harry be the one to find these items, even if we must guide him down that path.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDING!\u201d Sirius shouted. \u201cDing-a-ling-ding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, I agree with Black. Hunting down pieces of the Dark Lord\u2019s soul is no job for a child,\u201d Snape interjected. Harry bit his lip to keep himself from shouting out in agreement. Dumbledore was completely barmy! He hadn't even realised it was possible to lose pieces of his soul.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to feed us some cock and bull about a prophecy,\u201d Sirius snarled. \u201cTell us, or I\u2019ll feed you truth potion myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a long pause in which Harry could imagine Dumbledore\u2019s outraged look. He almost hoped they did feed him veritaserum.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d help him,\u201d Snape said, and Harry grinned.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore sighed. \u201cVery well. The new wards have detected the presence of a horcrux with in the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to tell us!\u201d McGonagall screeched. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally lost it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll collect that later. Continue,\u201d Sirius said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe them to be items from Voldemort\u2019s past, stored in places of great importance to him. Most likely three; the book, a locket that once belonged to his mother, and a ring that belonged to his grandfather. The book was given to his most trusted follower, Abraxus Malfoy, passed onto his son, Lucius. One item is evidently stored in the first place he called home, and one item stored somewhere relevant to his history. Perhaps the town his parents grew up in\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloody fool, Albus Dumbledore, keeping this to yourself,\u201d McGonagall growled. \u201cLet\u2019s go get them.\u201d There was a scraping of chairs, and the four of them left the room. Harry waited until he heard them all leave, and he sneaked out of the cupboard.</p>\n<p>Soul pieces, a prophecy, and an interfering old man. Harry had some research to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Severus eyed the locket, sitting proudly on a podium in what the elves called the Come and Go Room. They\u2019d had to enlist their help, unable to find the specific part of the castle the wards indicated.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo the honours, Snape?\u201d Black said. Severus sneered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think, perhaps, we should examine it before attempting to destroy it,\u201d Albus said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAvada kedavara,\u201d Severus growled, already fed up with Albus\u2019 nonsense.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Albus said. The locket screamed, black smoke exploding from it, filling the room, before tearing itself apart, throwing them all to the ground in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus! I am most disappointed \u2013 ouch!\u201d Albus said. Minerva had flicked her wand, and hit him with a stinging hex.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shut your big gob else it gets you into some more trouble you obnoxious arrogant senile fool!\u201d she spat, her Scottish accent more pronounced than usual. Severus raised a brow, quietly impressed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Black grinned. \u201cNice work,\u201d he said. Severus sneered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he retorted, but his disdain didn\u2019t diminish Black\u2019s cheer.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo down, one to go!\u201d Black remarked gleefully. \u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go explore his parents' digs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus rolled his eyes but followed Black out the room, Minerva and Albus hot on their heels.</p>\n<p>It took very little time to exit the school and apparate to Little Hangleton, and Severus realised with horror that he recognised the area. He disillusioned himself immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlbus! The Dark Lord inhabits the Manor across from here!\u201d he growled. Black and Minerva moved closer and they hid themselves in the shade of an oak tree.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, I suspected as much,\u201d Albus said, eyes twinkling merrily. Severus cancelled the disillusionment charm so as to glare at Albus properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to warn us!\u201d Black hissed, and Minerva had a similarly incredulous look upon her face. Severus took several deep breaths to gain control of his emotions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to be knocking on his front door,\u201d Albus replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cNear enough,\u201d Severus muttered. \u201cJust lead us to the bloody horcrux.\u201d Why did their only source of knowledge have to be an insufferable, delusional old man?</p>\n<p>They followed Albus up a winding dirt path that lead away from the village. It was over grown and had obviously not been used in some time. Eventually they came across a small, rundown shack. Severus fancied he could feel the malevolent aura of the horcrux even from outside. There was a dead snake nailed to the doorframe, and as Albus stepped toward over some unseen barrier it came to life.</p>\n<p>With a flick of his wand Albus dispatched it before it could do more than hiss, even the bones disintegrating to ash.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of you wait outside,\u201d Severus instructed. He cast several detection spells, but the only ward he could find was the one that activated the snake. He followed Albus into the shack.</p>\n<p>Mould covered the walls, and the furniture was in rotten disarray. Albus had his wand raised in silent detection spells, and he eventually pointed to an unassuming piece of floor. With a jerk of his wand the floorboard was ripped up, and there sat a steel box. Severus levitated it out of the hole and began slowly breaking down the curses that it was covered with. Finally, he got the container open.</p>\n<p>\u201cAriana!\u201d Albus cried, and fell to his knees, scrabbling at the box. Severus reacted instinctively, summoning the horcrux toward him and banishing Albus away from it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot have it!\u201d Albus growled, and lightning crackled toward him from the end of Albus\u2019 wand. Severus threw himself to the side. He crashed into the shack wall, breaking through the rotten wood.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a hold of yourself!\u201d Severus cried. He got to his feet and threw up the most powerful shield he knew, barely deflecting the next curse that came his way. Black and Minerva were at his side in an instant. Albus staggered out of the shack, wand raised. Another curse lanced toward them, but fizzled out halfway. Albus was staring at his wand in horror. He threw it away from himself, and his questionable sanity seemed to have restored itself.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies. It seems I am unusually susceptible to compulsion of that kind,\u201d Albus said quietly. Severus took a moment to get this breath back before casting several containment charms upon the steel box.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf what kind, exactly?\u201d Black questioned suspiciously. Albus\u2019 shoulders sagged. With a wave of his wand the shack was restored to its previous state.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps I should inform you after it\u2019s destruction?\u201d Severus huffed, but didn\u2019t disagree. \u201cAlthough\u2026 I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll allow me to examine it?\u201d Severus narrowed his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think, perhaps, you ought to leave, Headmaster, as you seem to be unable to fully resist this object\u2019s charms,\u201d Minerva said.</p>\n<p>Albus nodded sharply, and with one last glance at the box Severus was clutching to his chest, he disapparated.</p>\n<p>Severus placed the box on the dirt, and in one instant, removed all the containment charms and opened it up. In the middle sat an ugly ring, with a gold band and a large brown stone set into it.</p>\n<p>Grey smoke poured out of the stone, slowly forming a body.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Sev, don\u2019t you want to see me again?\u201d Lily asked as her features formed. \u201cAll you have to do is put on the ring.\u201d Severus stared at the beautiful features of his one true friend, the only woman he had ever loved, and the mother whose child he was protecting. Surely it was only right that Severus saw her every day? Black made a choking noise and staggered forward, and the inhuman apparition twisted in on itself and reformed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot! So good to see you old chap. Can\u2019t stay for long, but you\u2019ll always be able to see me if you just put on the ring,\u201d James Potter remarked cheerfully. \u201cDon\u2019t you think Harry would like to see his parents?\u201d Severus shook himself, and narrowed his eyes at his hated enemy. Black was sobbing, and he lurched toward the ring even as Minerva attempted to hold him back.</p>\n<p>How dare the Dark Lord use their losses against them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAvada kedavra!\u201d Severus snarled. Green light lanced toward the ring and the apparition screamed. Black smoke boiled out of the ring, reaching toward them before wailing as it converged into on itself and exploded.</p>\n<p>The ground where the horcrux had laid was brown and barren. At the very centre was the stone that had been set into the ring, and it twinkled at them eerily. Severus didn\u2019t dare pick it up, but it levitated it into the air and blasted it away from them. It flew into the foliage behind the shack, and Severus turned his back on it.</p>\n<p>Black was a sobbing mess, and Severus wasn\u2019t far behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us reconvene in 24 hours,\u201d Severus said stiffly, and he disapparated back to the castle, in desperate need for a glass of whiskey and a good night\u2019s sleep.</p>\n<p>Harry tried researching horcruxes, but could find absolutely nothing about them, so he gave it up as a lost cause. He trusted Sirius to keep him informed if necessary, and that was all he could do. The rest of Harry\u2019s summer was rather uneventful, although he caught Sirius looking at him with tears in his eyes a few times. Harry made sure to prank him extra hard on those days, and he soon cheered up. As much as Harry loved messing around all summer, he missed his friends and he missed Hogwarts, and so he was delighted when September 1<sup>st</sup> came around.</p>\n<p>Harry was seated next to Remus, who was apparently teaching Defence for the year.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione screeched as she entered the carriage and threw her arms around him. Harry patted her on the back awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Hermione. Hey Ron!\u201d he said, spotting the other boy over Hermione\u2019s shoulder. Ron grinned and waved back, throwing himself into a seat. It didn\u2019t take long for them to settle and begin sharing stories about their summer.</p>\n<p>The sorting felt as if it was taking forever, and he joined Ron, for once, in groaning with joy when the food arrived at their tables.</p>\n<p>\u201cBout time,\u201d Ron muttered around a mouthful of potato he\u2019d picked up with his hands and jammed into his mouth. Globs of gravy ran down his face, and Harry couldn\u2019t look away, watching with morbid fascination at the amount of food he managed to consume within seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cRon! Mind your manners!\u201d Hermione scolded. Several first years were also transfixed, and one particularly small girl looked as if she was about to faint.</p>\n<p>BANG! The explosion drew the attention away from Ron. Seamus was grinning ear from ear, his eyebrows burnt to cinders and parts of his hair and uniform still flaming. He held up a goblet.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally!\u201d he cried, and took a swig.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Finnegan!\u201d Professor McGonagall appeared behind him, and despite the scorched appearance Seamus still managed to pale. \u201cWhat in the name of all things do you think you are doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seamus took another swig of his goblet before turning to face her. McGonagall\u2019s eyes narrowed as she inspected the cup clasped in his hand, and she swiped it up and away from him.</p>\n<p>She took a sniff. The entire hall watched with bated breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn excellent water to rum transfiguration,\u201d McGonagall allowed. Harry cheered, even as Hermione glared at him. \u201cUnfortunately, consuming alcohol is illegal for minors. Twenty points from Gryffindor. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Seamus turned back to the table, a mischievous grin upon his face. Several upper year students were eying him contemplatively, and Harry used the following uproar as they tried to buy the spell from Seamus to slip away.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>About time, Master,\u201d</em> Baneofallrodents hissed from her perch on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>He raced towards Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom, and opened the passage to the Chamber of Secrets with a hiss.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sally! It\u2019s Hassa and Baneofallrodents!\u201d</em> There was the faint sound of scales scraping on stone, and Sally poked her head out of the pipe, her second eyelids firmly shut.</p>\n<p>There was a loud scream behind them. Harry turned, wand drawn. Malfoy had both hands clasped over his mouth, but it did nothing to diminish the girly shriek. His eyes rolled up into his head, and he collapsed into a dead faint. Harry poked him with his foot, but he didn\u2019t move at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops!\u201d Harry muttered, and levitated Malfoy out of the bathroom. \u201cForgot to lock the door,\u201d he realised. \u201cColloportus.\u201d He turned back to the basilisk.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How was your hot season?\u201d </em>Sally asked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fun and filled with lots of food. Did the elves bring you the snacks I asked them for?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYes, although they ran away whenever I tried to speak to them.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry barely manage to contain a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d</em>\u00a0he replied. He stroked her large nose. \u201c<em>I\u2019ll come and talk to you when I\u2019m next free, but I better go before Malfoy wakes up.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIf he gives you any trouble, send him to me, and I shall eat him for you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry grinned.\u00a0<em>\u201cThanks Sally. See you soon.\u201d</em> Her head retreated and Harry closed the entrance up once more. He could hear the sound of voices outside, and so pulled on his cloak before leaving the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the last time Draco, what have I told you about telling tales about Potter?\u201d Snape growled. Malfoy was quivering under his glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut sir, I\u2019m telling you, it was a basilisk!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry crept past them so that he was behind Snape\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Snape roared. \u201cDetention!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry lowered the hood of his cloak, and winked at Malfoy. Malfoy gaped.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s right there!\u201d Malfoy cried. Harry pulled the hood back up and Snape spun around. He narrowed his eyes and turned back to Malfoy once more, who\u2019d gone paler than snow.</p>\n<p>\u201cDetention for the rest of the week,\u201d Snape said quietly in a voice more terrifying than when he shouted. \u201cNow begone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sneaked away, laughing silently to himself. Served Malfoy right for being such a prat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Draco Malfoy,\u201d Severus admitted at the first staff meeting of the year. \u201cHis jealousy of Potter knows no bounds. Several times he\u2019s come to me with fabricated excuses for getting Potter into trouble, and although you all know how much I\u2019d like that to be true, the stories he comes up with are ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus frowned. \u201cLike what, my dear boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus sneered at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dragon that in first year Potter was apparently smuggling off the grounds. The polyjuice Potter had apparently brewed. The time Potter apparently hid in Lockhart\u2019s office and escaped through a hole in the wall that disappeared before I could even see it. The girl\u2019s bathroom Potter apparently spends his time in. The basilisk that Potter apparently has at his disposal! It\u2019s ludicrous. He\u2019s seeing Potter when he\u2019s not even there. I think he might be delusional,\u201d Severus concluded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is most worrying,\u201d Albus agreed. \u201cPerhaps we should have a discussion with him this evening?\u201d Severus nodded his approval. \u201cNow, moving on. Any other matters we need to discuss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeamus Finnegan has finally discovered how to transfigure water into rum,\u201d Minerva said. Severus bit back a groan. Every few years a dedicated student managed to create alcohol, and the resulting year was chaos.</p>\n<p>\u201cObliviate him,\u201d Severus suggested. Albus frowned at him over his half-moon glasses in disappointment. Minerva pursed her lips, and Severus was certain she was holding back a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s unethical, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll all have to keep an eye on your older students this year,\u201d Albus said. \u201cAnd Minerva, please impress upon Mr Finnegan the importance of keeping that spell to himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFat lot of good that\u2019ll do,\u201d Minerva muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid anyone see where Harry disappeared to during supper?\u201d Lupin piped up. Severus turned to glare at the werewolf. Lupin smiled mildly back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably getting up to some sort of mischief,\u201d he growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cUndoubtedly. He\u2019s a thirteen-year-old boy,\u201d Lupin agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw him in the Gryffindor Common Room earlier,\u201d Minerva offered. \u201cWhatever he was doing, it was brief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Minerva,\u201d Lupin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything else that ought to be brought to my attention?\u201d Albus asked, and a litany of denials answered him. \u201cVery well. Thank you all for coming, and good luck with your first set of lessons tomorrow. Poppy, would you mind staying behind? And Severus, would you be as good as to fetch Draco for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus nodded and departed to find his troublesome student.</p>\n<p>Poppy was waiting quietly in one corner and she cast a few subtle diagnostics as Draco walked in. Severus glanced at her, but she shook her head; nothing wrong with him, as far as she could tell. Draco was glancing nervously about the office, his eyes darting between the three of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked for me, Headmaster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, my boy. Please, take a seat,\u201d Albus said. Draco settled into the seat before the desk, looking tiny against the large wooden chair. \u201cNow, Severus has come to me with concerns that you\u2019ve been seeing things that aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s jaw dropped and he turned to glare at Severus.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir! It\u2019s all true! I\u2019m not imagining things, I know it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps the best way to settle this would be for us to view the memories with you?\u201d Albus suggested. Severus nodded. A sound idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Draco demanded. Albus frowned, but stood to retrieve his pensieve.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a device that will allow us to extract your memories and view them as if we were standing next to you. Think of the times you believe to have seen something that no one else has.\u201d Draco grimaced, obviously deep in thought. Albus placed his wand against Draco\u2019s forehead, and withdrew a long string of memories, placing them into the pensieve. Both he and Albus plunged forward into the liquid.</p>\n<p>As Severus watched each memory, inspecting it for signs of duplicity, his anger grew and grew. Eventually he fell out of the pensieve to be greeted by Draco\u2019s smug grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you so,\u201d Draco said, while Severus was still trying to find words to describe his anger. Albus was chuckling beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPOTTER!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cI\u2019M GOING TO KILL HIM!\u201d He could feel his eye twitching, and his blood boiling, and his heart felt like it was going to explode. There was a piercing pain skewering his mind and he was swaying where he stood.</p>\n<p>He took a step forward. The pain reached a crescendo, and his brain was shrinking, compressing, dying. His vision tunnelled, and then everything went black.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou killed Professor Snape!\u201d Malfoy bellowed as Harry walked into the Great Hall for breakfast. The whole room fell silent, and expectant eyes turned upon him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an alibi for the last 24 hours,\u201d\u00a0 Harry said quickly, but then he smirked at Malfoy. \u201cBut please, elaborate.\u201d</p>\n<p>The morning post arrived before Malfoy could continue, and Hedwig swooped down with a letter, landing on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>It was a howler. Harry nudged it open with the tip of his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019M SO PROUD OF YOU!\u201d Sirius\u2019 voice boomed. \u201cSNAPE\u2019S IN THE HOSPITAL WING AND YOU LOST MORE POINTS IN A DAY THAN I MANAGED IN A YEAR. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, KIDDO.\u201d It burnt itself to pieces.</p>\n<p>A great cheer erupted around the room, and Fred and George set off some fireworks that exploded in red and gold sparks. People ran over to him, clapping him on the back; Oliver Wood and another sixth year boosted Harry up onto their shoulders. Harry accepted their tributes, as was his due.</p>\n<p>There was a loud bang, and all the fireworks vanished; the Weasley twins booed their dismay. Dumbledore was standing at the podium in front of the teachers table.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I may have your attention.\u201d Reluctantly the room fell silent, and Harry jumped back down to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Snape is merely suffering from a brief illness. He will be back to teaching classes in no time, as I\u2019m glad you will be happy to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a let-down!\u201d someone from Hufflepuff yelled, and sniggers echoed around the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, if you could please return to your breakfast in an orderly and well-mannered fashion, that would be much appreciated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite their disappointment in discovering that Snape was still alive, all the Houses bar Slytherin were celebrating, and Gryffindor didn\u2019t even care that Harry had lost over five hundred points for keeping a basilisk in the school (amongst other things). He was being treated like a hero, and while he felt vaguely guilty he was also smug that he\u2019d finally gotten to Snape.</p>\n<p>In fact, he felt like a true son of a Marauder. Following the Howler, Sirius had written him a long and flowery letter singing Harry\u2019s praises. So, of course, that meant it was time for another prank.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, they\u2019re saying Snape\u2019s in the hospital wing because of you! He had an aneurysm,\u201d Hermione exclaimed. She\u2019d been late to breakfast, and had missed the announcement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, isn\u2019t it great!\u201d Harry replied. Hermione recoiled, and Harry thought back on his last sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, no!\u201d she cried.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, isn\u2019t it awful!\u201d Harry corrected, crossing his fingers behind his back. Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cSo\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Hermione groaned.</p>\n<p>Harry huffed. \u201cRude,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve been thinking, that with a little help from Fred and George...\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows at Hermione, who sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrank time,\u201d she said, sounding about as unenthusiastic as Ron faced with homework.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrank time?\u201d one twin said, popping up next to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cSound like our kind of thing,\u201d the other twin said, from next to Hermione. They grinned, and Harry grinned back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Severus had been out of the hospital wing for two days, with instructions to keep his blood pressure down. He fumed at the utterly useless advice, stalking back and forth within his quarters. At least it gave him an excellent reason to quit his job as a teacher once the Dark Lord was finally dead.</p>\n<p>Severus patted the vial of basilisk venom hidden in his front pocket. He\u2019d had Albus instruct Potter to extract it, the one good thing to come of the entire situation. The boy had barely been punished! He\u2019d been all for letting Filch get out the thumbscrews.</p>\n<p>Pain lanced up his side and Severus hissed, clenching his left forearm with his right hand.</p>\n<p>The Dark Mark was burning.</p>\n<p>Severus flooed Albus. \u201cHe\u2019s calling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Albus said, a solemn look in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Severus flooed to the Three Broomsticks, then apparated to Little Hangleton The Dark Lord\u2019s wards prickled as he passed through them, testing him for the Mark. He swept up three dusty stair cases, the once red velvet runner tattered and worn, and into the master bedroom. The Dark Lord was sitting as his desk, looking as if he\u2019d just forced himself from bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Severus. You have my potions? How was the first week back with those miserable little cretins?\u201d he drawled.</p>\n<p>Severus bowed, and the Dark Lord graciously allowed him to his feet. \u201cI have your potions, my lord,\u201d Severus said. \u201cDumbledore and his ilk are as annoying as usual, and Potter is being his normal spoilt self.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get theirs\u2026 all in good time,\u201d the Dark Lord hissed and he fingered his wand. Severus took a deep breath, and handed the Dark Lord his first potion.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlood Replenisher, Pepper Up, Strengthening Potion, and a Nutritional Supplement.\u201d The Dark Lord swiped each potion from him and drank it down quickly, grimacing at the taste. Severus clenched his hands behind his back as he handed the last one over. He could feel a bead of sweat forming on his brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good, Severus\u2026 you are my most faithful \u2013 ARK!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Dark Lord was clutching his throat, the empty vial of basilisk venom in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cExpelliarmous!\u201d Severus cried, and snatched the Dark Lord\u2019s wand away as he fumbled with it. The Dark Lord \u2013 Voldemort \u2013 stared at him incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus?\u201d he croaked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll your horcruxes have been destroyed!\u201d Severus gloated. Voldemort paled, and his eyes bulged.</p>\n<p>\u201cNooo!\u201d Voldemort gargled, collapsing to the floor. \u201cIt burns, it burns!\u201d he hissed, writhing about and scratching at the carpet, his breath coming laboured pants. Severus watched with distaste, and vague amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cMummy!\u201d Voldemort cried. And then he died.</p>\n<p>Severus took his time walking back down the stairs. He was admiring his forearm; pale, unmarked skin, a little red, perhaps, but it was free from the vile design that had covered it for so many years. He sent off a spell that would alert the aurors to trouble, and sat on a bench in the garden and waited.</p>\n<p>A girl with bubblegum pink hair and a loud voice arrived with Kingsley Shacklebolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cVoldemort\u2019s body,\u201d Severus said carefully, \u201cis in the master bedroom of this house.\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl\u2019s hair turned bright green, and her jaw dropped. Shacklebolt, luckily, was more professional.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo get Madam Bones,\u201d he snapped at the girl. Severus recognised her now; Nymphadora Tonks, mediocrely good at potions for a Hufflepuff.</p>\n<p>Severus proceeded to engage in a staring competition with Shacklebolt that he knew he was going to win. He\u2019d stared down Voldemort, Albus, and Minerva. Shacklebolt simply wasn\u2019t intimidating. Shacklebolt sighed as if he\u2019d realised that, and looked away.</p>\n<p>CRACK!</p>\n<p>Madam Bones, Nymphadora Tonks, four other aurors, Minister Fudge, Rita Skeeter and her photographer arrived. There was an extremely put upon expression on Madam Bones\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was merely a potions mishap,\u201d Severus began, \u201cgone awfully wrong\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>YOU-KNOW-WHO GONE FOR GOOD!</p>\n<p>INTERVIEW WITH THE HEROIC SEVERUS SNAPE</p>\n<p>THE POTIONS MISHAP THAT SAVED US ALL!</p>\n<p>By Rita Skeeter</p>\n<p>\n<em>Upon arriving in Little Hangleton, a small muggle village in Yorkshire, I was greeted by the hero of the hour, Severus Snape. He looked at me, and I swore I could feel him gazing into my very soul, his fathomless eyes so full of emotion it made me shiver. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He painted a striking figure, dark robes draping off his broad shoulders that set off his roguish good looks and smouldering charm. Of course, dedicated journalist that I am, I knew I needed to dig deeper than superficial impressions to discover the truth about You-Know-Who\u2019s defeat.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>RS: \u201cHow did you come to know the location of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>SS: \u201cAs recorded in the transcripts for my trial in \u201981, I have spent the last twelve years working as a mole for Albus Dumbledore. When He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named regained a body, I returned to his side as a spy and he thought me his most faithful. Unfortunately, I swapped out a simple Nutritional Supplement for a vial of Basilisk Venom I was carrying around with me, quite by accident, and so he perished.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>RS: \u201cBy accident!\u201d I was in shock when the daring Professor Snape finished his story. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean to tell me that you mistook Basilisk Venom for a Nutritional Supplement by accident.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>SS: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d I fanned myself; Severus was so brave he hadn\u2019t even meant to defeat You Know Who; it had just happened! I found myself to be flustered by his very presence. Finally, I pulled myself together in order to ask the question we\u2019ve all been wondering:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>RS: \u201cDid he have any final words?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>SS: \u201cHe merely expressed his regrets that he did not get a chance to spend more time with his family.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>A motto that I think we would all do well to adhere to, I\u2019m sure my kind readers would agree!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>RS: \u201cAnd what are you going to do with your life now?\u201d Severus had only just turned down Minster Fudge\u2019s offer of a position with the aurors, and my own suggestion that he hire me to write his biography.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>SS: \u201cI\u2019ll finish the term at Hogwarts, then retire somewhere no one like you can ever find me.\u201d I laughed gaily.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>RS: \u201cYou wound me!\u201d I joked, throwing him a coquettish glance, which he seemed entranced by.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>SS: \u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d he muttered, and I chuckled. Severus was such a joker!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Me, myself and I have formed a special sort of bond with Severus Snape, and I can tell that\u2019s he\u2019s going to be a regular heartthrob. Ask yourself, ladies; has your hubby ever defeated a Dark Lord? Severus Snape has! And he\u2019s still at Hogwarts until Christmas. But get in line: I saw him first!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Albus smiled to himself as he set down the paper, and twirled his beard around his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cPigs will fly the moment Severus Snape is declared a hero!\u201d Harry Potter announced, as he burst into the Great Hall. The students fell silent, waiting with bated breath as they watched Severus fume, and Harry grin.</p>\n<p>Moments later, the screaming began as all the work Harry and his friends had put into their latest prank paid off, and hundreds of pigs flew into the Great Hall, white feathered wings letting them take to the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cPOTTER!\u201d he heard Severus bellow, followed by the sound of giggling children fleeing the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cSave us, my devastatingly dashing hero, with your roguish good looks!\u201d Minerva cried. Albus shot her a disapproving look even as Severus huffed and stalked away from the staff table.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that really necessary?\u201d</p>\n<p>Minerva grinned. With a flick of her wrist she expanded the article and pasted it to the wall for all to read.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am feeling rather flustered,\u201d Pomona added, a gleam in her eye. A flying pig swooped low overhead and she banished it without bothering to look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI rather think I\u2019d suit coquettish,\u201d Filius squeaked.</p>\n<p>Albus sighed. He checked to see if Severus was still in the room; he wasn\u2019t. Then he brandished his wand, and conjured a fan for each member of the faculty, including himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo Severus Snape, the hero!\u201d Albus flicked the fan open, and waved it, allowing the breeze to blow his beard over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019s finally snapped!\u201d Minerva not so subtly whispered.</p>\n<p>Albus merely smiled. Perhaps he had.</p>"
