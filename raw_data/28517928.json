  "text": "<p>Luke bumps up against consciousness a few times before he manages to grab on.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know where he is; doesn\u2019t recognize the low ceiling above him or the loose rumbling of the ship\u2019s engine around him. Someone lays a hand on his forehead \u2014 warm, leather glove, holding him down more than soothing him \u2014 and says, in a voice that strikes a vague chord of recognition somewhere deep in his mind, \u201cGo back to sleep, Jedi.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next time he wakes he\u2019s slightly more aware of his surroundings. Fold-out med bed in the back of a junk trawler that\u2019s not in much better shape than the <em>Falcon, </em>mostly naked with fresh, pungent bacta smeared over ninety percent of his body. Everything hurts \u2014 his ribs, his shredded shoulder, the soles of his feet. He can hear someone moving around overhead, probably in the ship\u2019s cockpit, and he has a moment to think that he should probably get up and go see who it is, try to figure out how he ended up here, but the med bed\u2019s comfortable and keeping his eyes open is a lot of work and he can\u2019t remember the last time he had a full night\u2019s rest, or even a half night\u2019s rest, and he figures if whoever has him were going to kill him they would\u2019ve done it by now, so he lets his eyelids slip shut under the weight of exhaustion and goes back to sleep.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The third time he wakes \u2014 his existence fleeting, shallow, pained \u2014 the lights are off and he can hear someone else breathing in the hold with him, asleep. He floats just below the surface of true consciousness, too clouded by the pain of his wounds to think clearly, for what feels like an eternity. Before he slips away again, forced into white unconsciousness, he manages to maneuver himself into a healing trance; it\u2019s fitful and weak, and probably helps less than the bacta.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cJedi,\u201d the half-remembered voice says again, somewhere in the dark. \u201c<em>Luke</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke is stronger now; he extracts himself from the trance like a fly picking itself off of a spider\u2019s web, one filigree wing, one twiglike foot, sticky silk clinging. His eyes open to slits, giving him a blurred view of the world through his lashes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a man bending over his bed, a Mandalorian. Now that Luke\u2019s mind is clearer than it\u2019s been in days, he recognizes him instantly by his armor \u2014 he\u2019s the Mandalorian that Grogu thinks of as <em>Buir</em>, who Luke met on Moff Gideon\u2019s Imperial cruiser. That\u2019s at least one question answered, though Luke still has a lot more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2014 \u201d he tries to ask, intending to finish <em>happened?</em>, but the word comes out as an unintelligible rasp. His throat is dry, he realizes. Very, very dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m out of intravenous fluids,\u201d the Mandalorian tells him. \u201cSorry \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds the back of Luke\u2019s head and helps him sit up enough to gulp down some water, which Luke chokes on and coughs up all over his bare chest. The Mandalorian doesn\u2019t comment, just grabs a sterile white rag from a bin above the med bed and mops him up. Luke has enough experience being an invalid that it doesn\u2019t bother him too much, but it <em>is</em> strange to have a living, breathing caretaker, instead of a med droid. The Mandalorian runs the rag over Luke\u2019s spit-dribbled chin before getting up to toss it in a bag full of pink- and red-stained linens, and a stray feverish thought shoots across Luke\u2019s brain like a comet: no one has touched him like that \u2014 focused, careful, deliberate \u2014 in a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should try to get some more sleep,\u201d the Mandalorian says, halfway up the ladder to the cockpit. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a few hours.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Where?</em> Luke wants to ask, but before he can, unconsciousness takes him again.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>Question the Force,</em> Yoda once told him<em>, a Jedi does not. Question the path before them, a Jedi does not. Covet, a Jedi does not.</em></p>\n<p>Luke knows why the old Order had to start the indoctrination early \u2014 simple as they may seem, these three edicts are as hard for him to digest at twenty-eight as they were at nineteen. Because no matter how much Luke trusts in the Force, no matter how over-eagerly, bull-headedly accepting he is of the great generational responsibility which has been thrust upon him, most days he can\u2019t help but covet: sleep, rest, guidance, his friends, his family, more hours in a day, Aunt Beru\u2019s cooking, Chewie\u2019s crushing hug, Han\u2019s laugh and Leia\u2019s serene, knowing smile, someone to talk to who\u2019s more than twelve years old, someone to hear his doubts and insecurities who isn\u2019t a glowing blue Jedi master, someone to laugh with in the raw, quiet hours of the night, someone to share his bed, his joys, his sorrows, his life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em>Covet, a Jedi does not</em>, Luke reminds himself, when one of his younglings wakes him in the middle of the night to clean up sheets covered in spew. <em>Covet, a Jedi does not</em>, pacing the hangar level of the Praxeum and remembering how this place used to bustle and teem with life, pilots in orange jumpsuits and astromechs on mag-lifts and pit crews prepping X-wings for liftoff \u2014 now, so empty with his one lonely ship that his footsteps echo. <em>Covet, a Jedi does not,</em> with a manic, desperate edge, splashing water on his face after a particularly disturbing dream involving C-3PO and the feeling of metal on his bare skin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>That one, he doesn\u2019t have any particular trouble letting go of, but the rest creep into his psyche and stay, staining him with dark, dangerous yearning, until the way he reminds himself to let go, releasing his emotions into the Force, makes him feel like a puppet on strings, a one-man exercise in call and response.</p>\n<p><em>Covet, a Jedi does not</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Except a Jedi really, really does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next time he wakes, he\u2019s in his bed at the Praxeum, and Grogu is sitting on his chest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s far from the first time Luke\u2019s woken up like this in the months since the child has come to the temple, so he just smiles softly at him and thumbs the corner of his ear. \u201cHey there, little one.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Aboo,</em> Grogu says, his hands on Luke\u2019s face.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>From the start, he\u2019s been very tactile \u2014 all of Luke\u2019s kids turned out to be that way, once they realized that he doesn\u2019t mind, that he\u2019s not going to reprimand them for it. He knows that\u2019s not how younglings were raised in the temple on Coruscant, that it\u2019s not the old Jedi way, but he decided long before he took his first apprentice that he would be making a few non-negotiable edits to the Code. After all, he can imagine few things more cruel than depriving a child of love.</p>\n<p>In keeping with their usual morning routine, Luke moves Grogu off onto bed beside him, and Grogu takes that as an invitation to curl up like a tookacat in the crook of Luke\u2019s shoulder. Luke usually prods at him gently with the Force and makes him get up for the day \u2014 no matter how cute he is or how small he is or how sometimes Luke feels a tug in his chest like Grogu\u2019s his own child, it doesn\u2019t excuse him from morning meditation \u2014 but today he\u2019s feeling cautious about how nothing hurts, so he just yawns and lets both of them drift back to sleep.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, he\u2019s awakened by Dorsk shouting, \u201cCool, a flamethrower!\u201d</p>\n<p>He figures that\u2019s probably not a great sign, and that he ought to get out of bed. When he finally manages it, he shuffles into the kitchen on bare feet, his robe hanging from his shoulders and Grogu tucked in one arm, to find all his kids crowded around the Mandalorian, who seems to be cooking breakfast with an arm-mounted flamethrower.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em>Buir,</em> Grogu thinks, over their training bond.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stove,\u201d Luke\u2019s mouth says, before his brain catches up with what he\u2019s seeing.</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian looks at him \u2014 well, the helmet tilts his direction, and Luke assumes. \u201cThey broke it,\u201d he says.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThey broke it,\u201d Luke echoes.</p>\n<p>He turns his gaze on his apprentices, but they\u2019ve clearly had enough time to lock down the weak link, because Streen breaks into a flop sweat almost immediately but doesn\u2019t say anything. Kyp is sitting on the counter doing his whole \u2018too cool for this\u2019 act, Dorsk is still watching the Mandalorian\u2019s flamethrower with a look of intense concentration, and Tionne, the picture of innocence, says, \u201cArtoo\u2019s fixing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke looks pointedly at the stove, which Artoo is clearly not fixing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter he fixes your X-wing,\u201d Tionne amends.</p>\n<p>Luke frowns, setting Grogu down in his high chair at the table when he seems likely to make a dive for his breakfast. \u201cWhat happened to my X-wing?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, like no one can believe he just asked that. He at least expects an answer from Tionne \u2014 she\u2019s the responsible one, the oldest \u2014 but even she doesn\u2019t seem sure how to answer. Luke suddenly feels the same way he\u2019d felt waking up in the medbay after his near-death on Hoth; not sure what he\u2019d missed but knowing he missed <em>something</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It\u2019s the Mandalorian who asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke shakes his head. \u201cNo. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian explains as he and Luke go downstairs to take a look at his ruined X-wing in the hangar. He\u2019s not much of a talker, but Luke gets the gist: the Force signature he responded to on Dantooine wasn\u2019t a real child at all, but a trap set up by an Imperial remnant. The second he entered the atmosphere, they shot him out of the sky. Luke was knocked unconscious by crush wounds and G-force, but Artoo managed pilot his broken ship down into a dense forest, where it was hidden well enough that, even after days of searching, the Imperials (\u2018Imps,\u2019 the Mandalorian calls them) had no hope of finding him. When his padawans felt the disturbance through their training bonds, they tried the emergency codes which Luke had left for them \u2014 first Leia, then Chewie \u2014 but had gotten no response. Then they found the Mandalorian\u2019s personal code written on a tag inside Grogu\u2019s tiny robes and figured that would be as good a shot as any.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you came?\u201d Luke asks, incredulous.</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian looks at him flatly. \u201cTry not to sound so surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sorry. It\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019m not used to\u2026\u201d Luke shakes his head, mystified by his own reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since anyone showed up to rescue me, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian keeps looking at him for another long moment, inscrutable behind that helmet, and Luke wishes he were better at sensing people\u2019s feelings, because it\u2019s hard to read someone\u2019s face when you can\u2019t see it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>At last, he can\u2019t take the quiet anymore, so he adds, \u201cWhat I should\u2019ve said is thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian looks away. If Luke didn\u2019t know any better \u2014 which he doesn\u2019t, so maybe he\u2019s right \u2014 he\u2019d guess the man was uncomfortable. \u201cNo thanks necessary,\u201d he says, voice tight. \u201cI got to see the kid, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Luke says, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to rescue me as an excuse. You can see him whenever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>From the Mandalorian\u2019s silence, he infers, \u201cI forgot to mention that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>The continued silence, he interprets as \u2018yes.\u2019<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s just, with the other kids, most of their parents said they wouldn\u2019t want to visit even if they could, and that was \u2014 it turned out hurting them more than not offering at all, so I guess I just\u2026Skipped that part.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although, remembering his brief glimpse of the Mandalorian\u2019s face, his reverent expression and the sudden stab of agonized loss that Luke had felt from him as he handed the child over, he probably should\u2019ve <em>led</em> with visitation rights. Now, standing under his broken X-wing, he feels like an idiot. He\u2019s still shirtless under his robe and mostly barefoot, and he knows he has a mad case of bedhead, too, so he probably also <em>looks</em> like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stay as long as you want,\u201d he says, like that will make up for his blunder. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t interfere with training. There are plenty of empty rooms.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a long, tense beat, the Mandalorian nods, and walks out.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Leia says, when Luke finally manages to raise her on comms. \u201cWe were hiding on an asteroid in hostile territory, you know how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke squints. It\u2019s dark in his room and the holo is very bright. \u201cHostile territory?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHostile to Han, not the Republic,\u201d Leia clarifies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s most of space.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cDon\u2019t I know it. Marrying him is going to be a diplomatic nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cMarrying him?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s not a romantic consideration, Luke. If I don\u2019t marry someone soon, the Chancellor is going to use me as a bargaining chip in some sort of archaic political alliance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not a romantic consideration, why pick Han?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figure the father of my child is as good a choice as any.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke rubs his face with both hands. It\u2019s a two-handed headache. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the Senate arranged marriages.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Senate\u2019s trying to hold the New Republic together with duct tape and chewing gum. Anything goes, as long as it brings about some semblance of order.\u201d Now that he\u2019s rubbed his face vigorously, he realizes she sounds tired \u2014 looks it, too, with her hair loose and circles under her eyes. \u201cIf I bow out, Amilyn\u2019s going to take the brunt of the pressure. Hell, maybe I should go through with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo through with it?\u201d Luke asks. \u201cMarrying someone you don\u2019t love? For what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy duty to the Republic, that\u2019s what,\u201d Leia snaps, then looks immediately remorseful. \u201cThese are the hard days,\u201d she says, softer. \u201cWe\u2019re all having to make sacrifices. That\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re trying to build something that matters, that lasts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s eyes suddenly feel hot and prickly with tears. He rubs both hands over his face again, to cover it up, but Leia\u2019s too smart, too good at reading him. \u201c<em>Luke,\u201d</em> she says, softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he says, and then in contradiction, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re always right.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shakes her head sadly, but doesn\u2019t argue. \u201cAre your students okay?\u201d she asks, changing the subject. \u201cThe comm from the temple \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Luke says. \u201cWe\u2019re all fine. I was late getting back, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia doesn\u2019t look like she quite believes him, but she only says, \u201cOkay. It\u2019s late here. Talk soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees. \u201cTalk soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hang up.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Most of the time when Luke wakes up with Grogu asleep on his chest, it\u2019s because the child had a nightmare and levitated into his room; less often, it\u2019s because Luke had a nightmare and the child toddled in to comfort him.</p>\n<p>None of the other younglings are so sensitive to Luke\u2019s presence in the Force, even with their training bonds, and Luke figures it\u2019s because of all the training Grogu had before the fall of the Order. In a lot of ways, the child is even more experienced than he is in the ways of the Jedi, and there\u2019s something about having the small, warm weight of him curled up on his chest that calms Luke even in sleep. He has no idea if it\u2019s a Jedi trick, like how the child heals scraped knees and stubbed toes, blinking up at his fellow padawans with giant, sparkling eyes and a soft <em>boo</em>, or if it\u2019s as simple as having company in his weakest and most vulnerable moments, coming out of the thick nauseating roil of a dream to find that he\u2019s not alone. Either way, he\u2019s grateful. Hugely, stupidly grateful.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Artoo declines to fix the stove, citing that it\u2019s gross under there and that Tionne didn\u2019t ask him before she told Luke he would fix it, which is how Luke ends up on his back with his head dangerously close to the grease trap, trying to remember what Uncle Owen said when their stove broke back on Tatooine. Luke was ten at the time, so the memory\u2019s hazy, but it\u2019s not like he can call a repairman.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s straining to reach a tool that\u2019s rolled out onto the kitchen floor when he sees the Mandalorian\u2019s boots walk into the room. He senses Grogu\u2019s presence with him \u2014 a bright, happy lilt \u2014 and, mindlessly following the chain of the child\u2019s thoughts, says, \u201c<em>Buir</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boots halt. The Mandalorian crouches, cape pooling on the floor behind him, and tilts his helmet so he can see Luke under the stove. \u201cDin,\u201d he corrects. \u201cDin Djarin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDin,\u201d Luke amends, blushing furiously. He figures it\u2019s no use trying to go back to undo his earlier slip \u2014 directly adressing it can only make things worse \u2014 so he forges on. \u201cCan you hand me that spanner?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian \u2014 <em>Din, </em>Luke reminds himself<em> \u2014 </em>can, and he does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Some mornings, Luke rises with the sun; others, he\u2019s already awake, late nights tending the archives turning into bleary-eyed slurping down caf in the empty kitchen; in both cases, he often climbs the ziggaraut to watch the sun rise over the jungles of Yavin IV.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The rays breaking over the horizon bring him a quiet sort of peace, the same peace he used to find watching the suns set on Tatooine. Sometimes there\u2019s an itch in his spine that makes him stand up and move through katas, an almost restlike meditation in the burn of his muscles; sometimes he simply sits with his caf and feels the balmy wind in his hair and thinks about all the Jedi who sat here before him and all the Jedi who will sit here after him, a simultaneously lonely and companionable ache in his chest.</p>\n<p>This morning, he\u2019s not alone. He senses Din before he sees him, a calm, steadfast presence in the Force. He falters when he climbs the last step and sees Luke sitting on the edge, but when Luke turns to him with a friendly smile and says, \u201cCome on, sit down,\u201d he does.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Shoulder to shoulder, only a foot of space between them, Luke suddenly remembers the comforting sense of him in the dark cargo hold of the ship, the warm sound of his breathing. \u201cDo you sleep with that on?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Din gives him a look that Luke thinks would be a startled blink if he weren\u2019t wearing a helmet. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNot if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke hums. \u201cNot too comfortable?\u201d</p>\n<p>Din huffs something that might almost be a laugh. \u201cNot too comfortable,\u201d he agrees.</p>\n<p>They lapse into comfortable silence for a few minutes, watching the sun creep ever-higher in the sky, before Luke thinks of something else. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to spar?\u201d</p>\n<p>Din considers for a moment, then shrugs. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since Luke\u2019s had occasion to make a new friend, so his overtures of comradeship and fealty are sort of clumsy, but he figures Din\u2019s history of nursing Luke back to health and wiping spit off his chin uniquely qualify him to not give a kriff, so his awkwardness falls away quickly. It helps that they spend most of their quality time in the early mornings, tumbling and dancing together on the dusty mats in the sparring room, Luke sweating in his gray workout kit, Din battened down in full armor, trading hits with a couple of practice staffs that Luke dug out of storage. Luke\u2019s never sparred with someone like this, someone who can meet him blow for blow, and it\u2019s <em>good</em>, so good that he finds himself laughing as he uses the Force to leap around the room, as he ducks Din\u2019s staff and sweeps at him with his own, so good that after, when they both collapse on the mat, Luke flat on his back, Din buckled onto his hands and knees, Luke wants to reach out and touch him.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>So good that, lying in bed at night, Luke can\u2019t help but want to touch him some more, remembering the easy familiarity of their bodies, how they moved together in concert, the sharp barking wood of their staffs and how it felt when Din laid a gloved hand on his forehead in the close womblike cradle of the med bed, murmuring <em>Go back to sleep, Jedi</em>, how he says <em>Luke</em> in the early mornings, low, short, matter-of-fact, and Luke knows it\u2019s just his name but he\u2019s always had an overactive imagination, so it\u2019s easy to imbue it with all sorts of meaning. And Luke can\u2019t bite Din\u2019s palm, he can\u2019t buck his hips up into Din\u2019s grip, so he bites his own palm and bucks up into his own grip and reminds himself, sticky and frustrated in the aftermath, <em>Covet, a Jedi does not.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant to ask,\u201d Din says, some weeks into his stay. \u201cThe scars on your chest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead and ask, then,\u201d Luke teases. He\u2019s pouring tea for the whole clan \u2014 Kyp\u2019s the only one who shares Luke\u2019s addiction to caf. \u201cOr was that a question?\u201d</p>\n<p>Din, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed, just looks at him, not rising to the bait. He\u2019s getting to know Luke too well to fall for it when Luke uses humor to deflect.</p>\n<p>Luke sighs. \u201cIt was a Sith,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Din still doesn\u2019t say anything. Luke, as usual, feels the need to fill the silence. \u201cForce lightning,\u201d he explains. \u201cA darksider ability, one that I pray died with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou killed him?\u201d Din asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says. \u201cMy father did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din makes a short sound. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Jedi had fathers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they not teach biology on Mandalore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up on Mandalore,\u201d Din says, and then, \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke nods as he finishes pouring the last cup of tea. \u201cThat was the old way,\u201d he explains. \u201cChildren were taken from their parents and raised in the Order, forbidden from developing personal attachments. The masters worried that divided allegiance would diminish a Jedi\u2019s commitment to the Order, and thought it was easier to let go if the younglings never knew their parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you worried about it?\u201d Din asks, something reserved and almost dangerous in his tone. \u201cDivided allegiance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke shakes his head. \u201cNo. We\u2019re not at war. I\u2019m not training soldiers. You don\u2019t have to be mindlessly obedient to uphold the ideals of decency and goodness.\u201d</p>\n<p>He puts the tea cups on a tray. \u201cBesides, you can\u2019t expect any being to survive without love. That would be cruel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love them?\u201d Din asks. \u201cYour students?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke falters, caught off guard. He can already hear the talking-to he\u2019s going to get from Yoda and Ben later, but on this one thing he\u2019ll never bend to them, so he answers honestly. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare that his father appears to him, but when he does he comes to Luke at night, in the private, insulated hours before the dawn, when the landscape is dark and the peaceful, sleeping signatures of Luke\u2019s students float like fireflies at the edge of his awareness. They sit close together in the empty meditation room, Anakin\u2019s glowing blue knees nearly touching Luke\u2019s \u2014 if they could even touch \u2014 and Anakin tells him stories about growing up on Tatooine, about pod racing, about Naboo, about the first time he saw Luke and Leia\u2019s mother, the first time he kissed her, how his palms sweated at their wedding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Mostly he shies away from offering Luke advice; Luke knows that his father doesn\u2019t think he has any good advice to give, that he\u2019s not worthy to bestow it, with everything he did. But he does give him one piece of wisdom: <em>Make sure they know they can talk to you. Make sure they know that their problems are your problems, that you\u2019re not going to get mad at them for what they\u2019re feeling. I think\u2026</em></p>\n<p><em>I think,</em> he says, gazing off at the floor with something twisted and regretful in the set of his jaw, <em>if I could\u2019ve talked to someone about Padme, about the dreams I was having\u2026maybe I wouldn\u2019t have fallen.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Luke takes to running to blow off steam \u2014 and with Din in the temple, there\u2019s a lot of steam. Sometimes he takes Grogu with him, in a sling on his back like he used to carry Yoda on Dagobah, light-footed over roots and streams as he circles the temple for hours on end. Din\u2019s taken over some of the basic hand-to-hand lessons that Luke was teaching the older ones, but Grogu\u2019s too young, so while his father\u2019s occupied Luke takes him and does flips over tall trees and handstands with Grogu balanced on his feet, feeling the clear, happy burble of the child\u2019s delight in the Force while he peers down at Luke and says, <em>Aboo.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Luke says back, smiling upside-down. \u201cHow\u2019s the weather up there?\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Grogu might not like being carried, but he certainly delights in being tall, which is why Luke sometimes lets him sit on his shoulder while he cooks dinner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It\u2019s sizzling noodles tonight, like Aunt Beru used to make it, with a side of eggs for anyone who\u2019s too coward to handle the amount of spice Luke likes. Grogu tips over ambitiously toward a raw egg, and Luke steadies him with the Force, laughing. \u201cPatience is a virtue, padawan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d do anything for an egg,\u201d Din says, coming up behind him.</p>\n<p>Luke smiles fondly. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din runs a gloved finger over the shell of Grogu\u2019s ear, and when the child reaches for him he picks him up off Luke\u2019s shoulder and tucks him against his chest. Grogu puts his hands on Din\u2019s helmet and coos up at him, and something heavy passes between father and son that Luke\u2019s helpless to interpret. It feels like something he shouldn\u2019t be watching, anyway, as much as he wants to, so he turns his attention back to his noodles.</p>\n<p>After a minute of quiet, the sauce sizzling on the stove, Din says, \u201cYou can talk to him, can\u2019t you? You can hear his thoughts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Startled, Luke nods.</p>\n<p>Din holds his finger out for Grogu to curl his hand around, and Luke feels a stab of something from him in the Force \u2014 sadness? longing? \u201cCan you teach me?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>With a lurch, Luke realizes that Din has never spoken to his child, that he may in fact die of old age before he ever gets the chance. And he wishes then, standing stupidly with a wooden spoon in his hand, that he could give Din some of his power, that he could let him have this \u2014 but he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Din must read the answer on his face, because his shoulders tighten, and he nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Luke says uselessly.</p>\n<p>Din only nods again.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Luke spends the next several nights in the archives, poring over the scant tomes he\u2019s managed to acquire. Most have come via Lando from black market dealers, some have come through more official channels and Leia\u2019s tri-monthly supply delivery, but all of them have one thing in common \u2014 Luke lacks most of the context to sufficiently understand what they say. Nevertheless, in consultation with Ben\u2019s ghost, he works his way through a dense text about Force bonds and communication, and after dinner one night, while Dorsk and Streen are yelling at each other over the dishes, he pulls Din aside and says, \u201cBring Grogu.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can sense Din\u2019s uncertainty as he follows Luke into the meditation room, and the hesitance stays as he folds down to sit cross-legged on the mat with Luke, Grogu in his lap. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI think I found a way to help you talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din goes very, very still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be acting as a conduit,\u201d Luke babbles in the quiet, inexplicably nervous all of a sudden \u2014 like Din will be mad at him for his presumptuousness, like he won\u2019t like his gift. \u201cSo I\u2019d hear everything, but \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Din says.</p>\n<p>Luke feels a rush of giddy relief. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to touch your skin \u2014 it can be your hand, if you can take off your glove \u2014 \u201d and before he\u2019s even finished speaking, Din\u2019s glove is off, his bare hand resting palm-up on his knee, meditation style. Luke wonders wildly if Mandalorians meditate, or if Din\u2019s been watching him, looking in on the morning meditation. It doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 he scoots forward, close enough that he can take Din\u2019s hand in one of his and rest the other on Grogu\u2019s soft head.</p>\n<p><em>Aboo,</em> the child comments, reaching up to grab Luke\u2019s pinky finger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNow, be quiet, and open your mind,\u201d Luke says. \u201cIf you sense my presence, don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din\u2019s grip on his fingers tightens. Luke\u2019s stomach swoops, and it has nothing to do with the tricky Force work he\u2019s doing and everything to do with the warmth of Din\u2019s palm against his.</p>\n<p>He gathers himself and reaches for his training bond with Grogu, at the same time reaching for the Force-null cloud of Din\u2019s thoughts, like the book instructed him. Luke doesn\u2019t have the background in mind healing that the text expected him to, but he\u2019s quite sure that he\u2019s dedicated more thought to the matter in the last few days than any Jedi in a millennium, so after a few shaky tries, he manages to hook the connection, like fitting a wrench around the right bolt by touch alone.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Din who tells him he has it right, sucking in a sharp, watery breath.</p>\n<p><em>Buir,</em> the child thinks along the bond, and Din laughs.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Later \u2014 after long, happy hours cross-legged on the meditation mat, after Grogu has relayed an entire lifetime in sights and sounds and snacks, after he\u2019s started to tilt over in his father\u2019s lap and tiredness has crept over the training bond, after Luke gently breaks the connection and drifts behind them, suddenly bereft, as Din carries the child to bed, after he lingers in the hallway, unsure of his welcome, and finally tears himself away to head back to his own bed for the first time in a week \u2014 Din closes the child\u2019s door softly behind him and says, \u201cLuke.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something in his voice that\u2019s tight, almost urgent, and Luke stops in his tracks. Din comes down the dark hall, past the closed doors of the other students\u2019 rooms, puts a hand on the back of Luke\u2019s skull, and leans his helmet against his forehead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201c<em>Thank you.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Some vital part of Luke\u2019s anatomy has gone soft and jelly-fied at the feeling of Din\u2019s gloved fingers in his hair, but he manages to choke out, \u201cNo thanks necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The cave swallows him out of a dream about the smoky swamps of Dagobah, and Luke feels his body twist like a knotted wire even though he\u2019s asleep. He knows that he\u2019s asleep, but he can\u2019t wake \u2014 he can never wake when he dreams of the cave, like the hanging roots and the cloying <em>wrongness </em>of the place have taken hold of his unconscious soul. He never sees the same thing twice, like the cave evolves along with his fears, and tonight it\u2019s Grogu\u2019s cries that he hears, Din\u2019s voice yelling for him in the dark.</p>\n<p>He wakes with a start to the feeling of the child settling on his chest, and catches himself before he can dislodge him. His heart is beating a million miles an hour, lungs heaving, terrified sweat drying on his forehead and the back of his neck, and he clings to Grogu\u2019s simple, calming presence in the Force with a desperation that he never has before. Din\u2019s screams echo in his head, and suddenly, cradling Grogu with shaking hands, he wishes that he could cling to him, too \u2014 could run his hands over him and reassure himself that he was okay, that he was whole, that they were all together. The desire is so strong that Luke has to shut his eyes against it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>Covet, a Jedi does not.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>Grogu coos sleepily, tiny hand on Luke\u2019s chin. Luke presses a kiss to his peach-fuzzy head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he tells him. \u201cGo back to sleep, little guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grogu does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s afternoon, and Luke\u2019s leading his padawans through an elementary second form kata \u2014 Streen wobbling precariously on one foot, Tionne textbook-perfect, Grogu lying flat on his back and cooing at a butterfly \u2014 when he hears the whine of a ship\u2019s engine overhead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He frowns as he watches it sink out of atmo, hand raised to shield his eyes from the sun. He recognizes that ship, and the fact that it\u2019s here on Yavin can\u2019t mean anything good.</p>\n<p>\u201cTionne,\u201d he says, \u201ctake everyone to the panic room. Kyp, find Din.\u201d</p>\n<p>As his kids scatter, he walks down the outside of the ziggaraut to meet the <em>Slave I</em> as it lands. He doesn\u2019t take his lightsaber out \u2014 he\u2019s learned over the years that starting from a place of violence is never a good way to get to peace \u2014 but he keeps his hand on the hilt as the ramp unfolds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He\u2019s not taking any chances. Not with the younglings.</p>\n<p>Boba Fett clunks down the ramp in full armor with his hand on his blaster, so apparently Luke made a good call. They stand face to face, mere feet apart, for a tense, silent minute.</p>\n<p>\u201cSkywalker,\u201d says Fett, at last. \u201cLast time I saw you, I was left for dead in a sarlacc pit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurnabout is fair play,\u201d Luke says. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend you weren\u2019t about to shoot me in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p>In a flash, Fett has his blaster out and pointed at Luke\u2019s head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s lightsaber hums in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Fett says. \u201cTurnabout\u2019s fair play. So maybe I oughta shoot you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din\u2019s voice comes from somewhere behind them. \u201cTry it, Fett.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke doesn\u2019t turn his head, but he determines from the minute motion of Fett\u2019s helmet where Din must be standing. \u201cDjarin,\u201d says the other Mandalorian. \u201cJust the man I was looking for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put that blaster down, I\u2019ll be the last man you ever see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouchy,\u201d Fett comments, but all the same he lowers the blaster, puts it away. \u201cYou ought to notify us when you adopt new clan members, Djarin. It\u2019s dangerous, letting your friends fumble around in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke extinguishes his lightsaber and clips it back on his belt, turning just in time to see Din put his own blaster away. \u201cWhat do you want, Fett?\u201d Din asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how\u2019d you find this place?\u201d Luke demands, once his brain stops fixating on <em>clan</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll questions best answered over a nice cup of caf,\u201d Fett says. \u201cAre you going to invite me in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No,\u201d</em> Din says, before Luke can.</p>\n<p>Fett holds up his hands in surrender and turns back up the ramp. \u201cI guess I better invite <em>you</em> in, then. <em>Just</em> you, Djarin \u2014 leave the Jedi out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke catches Din\u2019s arm on his way past. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anything else, but Din holds his gaze \u2014 visor to eyes \u2014 for a long beat, and Luke knows he understands. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d he promises, and sweeps up the ramp after his kinsman.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Less than an hour later, <em>Slave I</em> heads back out of atmo. Luke stands in the opening to the underground hangar bay and watches Din come back towards him across the disturbed dirt of the courtyard, cape whipping in the breeze kicked up by the ship\u2019s liftoff. There\u2019s something tense and charged in how he walks, like he\u2019s carrying energy he hasn\u2019t been able to release yet, and instead of slowing down as he reaches Luke, he steps right into his space, lifts him off his feet, and crowds him into the afternoon shadows, pressing him up against a pillar. Luke grabs onto his shoulders, taking fistfuls of his cape, and holds on hard, like it will help him get a handle on how every nerve ending in his body has come alive at once.</p>\n<p>Din\u2019s helmet presses into the side of his face, cool against Luke\u2019s skin. \u201cYou scared me,\u201d he says. His fingers dig into Luke\u2019s side, next to his spine. \u201c<em>Kriff,</em> you scared me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke remembers the feverish need he\u2019d felt when he woke up from his dream the other night, to hold Din and feel that he was okay, and realizes with a slap of recognition that it must be mutual. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he assures him, sliding one hand up to hold his helmet, wishing he could hold his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ve survived Boba Fett before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din lets out a long, shaky breath into the crook of Luke\u2019s neck, and one of his trembling hands \u2014 still gloved \u2014 slides beneath his shirt to touch bare skin. Luke\u2019s grip on his shoulder and his helmet tightens to something with an edge of desperation, and for the first time he notices just <em>how much </em>of Din is pressed up against him, the hard lines of his beskar armor and the warm leather of his gloves, both hands now, tangled up beneat Luke\u2019s robes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em>\u201cDin,</em>\u201d he breathes, turning his mouth against his helmet.</p>\n<p>Din makes a sound like he\u2019s been kicked, and he tips his helmet under the hinge of Luke\u2019s jaw, like he wants to kiss his neck. Luke slides his leg up the outside of Din\u2019s, wanting to get closer, and hooks it around his waist, so that Din is settled in the cradle of his hips, so that he can grind down against the bulge in his pants.</p>\n<p>He chokes on a gasp, high and thready, and Din says, \u201c<em>Luke</em>, can I \u2014 \u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em>,\u201d Luke says, \u201cgods, please \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>A gloved hand slips under the waistband of his pants, worn leather soft on his cock. Din mutters something in Mando\u2019a that must be a swear, <em>cyar\u2019ika</em>, and Luke clings to him and turns his face into his helmet and tries not to lose himself to how good it feels, which is difficult because he\u2019s <em>on fire.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p>Din\u2019s voice, the shape of him under Luke\u2019s hands, how solid he is, his body pressed tight and unmoving against Luke\u2019s and his hand working furiously between them \u2014 a pressure builds inside him like nothing he\u2019s ever felt in previous sexual encounters, so that Luke\u2019s helpless to do anything but pant against Din\u2019s helmet, his breath fogging the visor, and move into the deliberate, focused squeeze of his hand. \u201cDin,\u201d he begs, and then, acting on some wild instinct, \u201c<em>Buir.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sharp spike of arousal in the Force.</p>\n<p>All the air shocks out of Din at once, and with a final, savage tug, he finishes Luke off.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Luke trembles in his arms, totally boneless. One of his legs slips down, and his foot hits the ground. When he comes back to himself, breathing hard, chest pressed against beskar, he reaches between them for Din\u2019s cock and finds a warm, sticky mess.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Din says, but he doesn\u2019t sound sorry at all. Which is good, because Luke\u2019s not sorry, either.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Retrieving his padawans from the panic room, feeding them dinner, and reassuring them that everything is okay so that they calm down enough to go to bed occupies Luke so completely that he forgets to ask what Boba Fett wanted until Din is already putting Grogu to bed, at which point he starts thinking words like <em>family </em>and <em>home </em>and gets slapped across the face by a really serious existential crisis.</p>\n<p>An hour later, in the pouring rain, he runs into a circle of ruins deep in the Yavin jungle, and falls to his knees. He\u2019s soaked to the bone, freezing, shivering pitifully in the moonlight, and faintly in some part of his brain that\u2019s still capable of coherent thought, he hopes that his blue-lipped appearance will make the masters more receptive to his pleas. He bows his head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cMasters,\u201d he says, then, voice breaking, \u201cFather, hear me. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, he\u2019s alone with the rain and his raging heart.</p>\n<p>Then a soft blue glow suffuses the ruins, and he looks up into his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cLuke,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve had a rough day, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke laughs, and halfway through it turns into a sob. Tears mingle with rain on his face.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTroubled, you are,\u201d says Yoda, behind him. \u201cSense it, I can. Your vows, you wish to betray.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin scowls over Luke\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe never made any vows,\u201d he snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn his heart, he made them,\u201d Ben says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>kark </em>that \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMasters,\u201d Luke cuts in, before this can get out of hand. \u201cFather. I require your guidance. I would be grateful if you could keep your own squabbles out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Appropriately chastised, none of the ghosts says another word.</p>\n<p>Luke takes a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. It\u2019s difficult; he has a lot of them, and none of them are in any particular order. He thinks of his padawans, who he loves, and Din, who he loves, and what he\u2019s read of the old Order\u2019s teachings, that love was dangerous because it lead to jealousy, possessiveness, fear, rage. He tries to imagine a future in which he is alone, in which he has denied himself Din\u2019s touch and Din\u2019s company in his bed, denied his children his protection and affection, and wonders if it\u2019s possible that in cutting himself off from his family he might love them less, might be driven less to fear if they were ever in danger, less to anger if they were ever hurt. He thinks that he could close himself in a Force-dampening cell for a thousand years and not see another living soul and still feel as fiercely and inextricably attached to them as he does now. He thinks that there is not one single version of Luke Skywalker that doesn\u2019t end up here, in the rain, chest empty because he left his heart in the hands of a Mandalorian.</p>\n<p>He turns to his father. Anakin is watching him, expression halfway between pride and sorrow. \u201cMy mother,\u201d Luke begins. \u201cDid you fall because you loved her, or because you weren\u2019t allowed to love her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin doesn\u2019t answer. He probably knows it\u2019s a rhetorical question.</p>\n<p>Luke turns around to look at his first, best-loved master. \u201cBen. You loved your padawan, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ben\u2019s eyes, impossibly old and impossibly sad, find Anakin. \u201cYes,\u201d he admits, after a beat. \u201cHe was my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t fall,\u201d Luke says. \u201cYou never fell, not even when he did. It\u2019s not love that causes a Jedi to fall, is it? It\u2019s denial of it. It\u2019s when you lock it away, let it fester. When it turns into resentment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoda scoffs disdainfully. \u201cFoolish, this line of questioning is. Clear, the Order\u2019s teachings are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke stands, rain pounding on his shoulders.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cDead, the Order is,\u201d he shoots back, and Anakin laughs.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>As he walks back to the temple in the cleansing downpour, mud up to his thighs, Luke lets himself look directly at his feelings for Din for the first time. It\u2019s like staring into a floodlight, into the sun \u2014 he laughs aloud at the swoop of exhiliration in his chest, the sudden freedom of being able to wonder, really wonder, <em>does he smile under the helmet, does he roll his eyes, does he look at me when I\u2019m not looking at him.</em> <em>Does he have all his eggs in one basket, like I have all my eggs in one basket, and is it as new and terrifying for him as it is for me.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s hypothermic and way out of his head by the time he makes it back to the hangar, so it\u2019s a good thing Din meets him by the lift. \u201cHi,\u201d Luke says, smiling big and dopey.</p>\n<p>Din catches him by the shoulders. \u201cWhere have you been? You\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Luke says. \u201cReally \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>Then he sort of passes out, and the next thing he\u2019s aware of he\u2019s sitting in the floor in a \u2019fresher, the shower is steaming up, and Din is wrestling with his muddy pants in a way that feels angry.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Luke says again.</p>\n<p>Din stops, crouched by his feet, and looks at him. The heat has fogged up the visor on his helmet, and Luke reaches out to touch him, struck by the sudden urge to leave fingerprints in the condensation. Din catches his hand before he can, folding Luke\u2019s fingers into his. \u201cYou need to warm up,\u201d he says, in a tone that leaves no room for argument.</p>\n<p>He helps Luke get his pants off, but once he determines that he can stand on his own without falling over, he leaves him to handle the rest on his own.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Luke tries not to feel too disappointed \u2014 after all, it must be getting pretty hot under all that armor. He wants to ask Din to stay, ask him to strip down, to trust Luke with his body, but he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not the right time.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>None </em>of this is the right time, really, Luke thinks, skin turning pink under the scalding heat of the shower. They feel like something that happened by accident, that shouldn\u2019t have happened at all in a pre-ordained universe, and somehow that makes Luke even more sure of it, of them \u2014 Din isn\u2019t destiny, he\u2019s not fate, he\u2019s not some prophecy passed down by the all-powerful all-knowing Force, he\u2019s just a man who stumbled into Luke\u2019s life and decided to stay.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When he emerges from the shower, Din is waiting in the kitchen with tea. Luke\u2019s never seen him brew tea, and he\u2019s sort of bummed he missed the experience, but he figures he\u2019ll get another chance.</p>\n<p>He joins him at the table just as Din stands up. They both falter. Din picks up the tray and says, \u201cI thought maybe somewhere more private.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke swallows, suddenly nervous. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cMy room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Inside, he closes the door. Din sets the tea down on his small table, moving aside Luke\u2019s tablet. Then he sits down and takes his helmet off.</p>\n<p>Luke freezes with his hand on the other chair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Din looks up at him, lips pressed tight together, like he\u2019s awaiting judgement. Luke wants to stare at him \u2014 he wants to spend the rest of his life staring at him \u2014 but he knows what Din needs right now, and it\u2019s not that, so instead he pulls out the chair and sits down.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Din pours them each a cup. They sip. There\u2019s something almost unspeakably intimate about this, for all its simplicity \u2014 sharing a cup of tea. Luke holds hot, fragrant water on his tongue and has visions of waking up in the morning next to this man, falling asleep next to this man, squeezing next to each other in front of the mirror in the \u2019fresher, learning his morning routine and the pattern of his snores and how the hair grows on his legs, how he looks when he oversleeps and jolts awake, disoriented, harried, embarrassed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did Boba Fett want?\u201d Luke asks, trying to keep the conversation as normal as possible.</p>\n<p>Din sets down his cup, licking a shine of tea off his upper lip. \u201cTo tell me Bo-Katan was looking for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBo-Katan Kryze?\u201d Luke asks, momentarily thrown. \u201cWhy\u2019s she looking for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe wants to be king of Mandalore,\u201d Din says. \u201cSo she has to fight me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does she have to fight you to be king of Mandalore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Din says, sort of awkwardly. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m king of Mandalore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Luke comments. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been my first guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Din smiles \u2014 a small, fleeting thing, soft enough to warm Luke to his core. He can\u2019t help but smile back, that big, dopey smile again, which definitely clues Din into the fact that he\u2019s being watched. His smile falls. He clears his throat. \u201cI should say something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Luke says, too fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Din says. \u201cI know. I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a minute, he continues, \u201cI was raised to believe in a creed. I still believe in it, for the most part. I believe in what it means to be a Mandalorian \u2014 in honor, in loyalty, in\u2026family that goes beyond blood. But I know now that there is more than one way. And I might still\u2026I might always hide my face from outsiders. But I don\u2019t have to hide it from the people I love. From my clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s breath is caught somewhere next to his heart. He gets out of his chair, steps around the table, and stops, not knowing how he\u2019s allowed to proceed. His hand hovers over Din\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Din says, \u201c<em>yes</em>,\u201d and reaches up to grab him as Luke climbs into his lap.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>As the rains stop and Yavin crawls into a blazing summer, Luke takes the padawans on a scavenging expedition to one of the neighboring ruins, and Tionne finds a device that turns out to be a laser tattoo gun. Luke tries to forbid its use, Tionne claims to be an autonomous adult at the age of fourteen, and by the time <em>that </em>argument is over he realizes that Streen has already stolen it and is tattooing <em>KICK ME</em> in basic on Dorsk\u2019s butt.</p>\n<p>Luke sighs, rolls his eyes skyward, and decides that the best way to corral the situation is to declare Tionne in charge of the tattoo gun, and make her promise to only use it on the six month setting. She gets it back from Streen in less than a minute and turns <em>KICK ME </em>into <em>KICK MEANIES!</em>, which Luke guesses he supports in spirit even if he wouldn\u2019t have wished it permanently tattooed on the rear end of one of his padawans.</p>\n<p>Tionne covers her own legs in ornate, swirling designs, turns it on the one hour setting and draws doodles on Grogu\u2019s hands and feet that make him coo happily and tilt his head, and refuses to write swear words on Kyp\u2019s forehead while he\u2019s sleeping, which means Streen and Dorsk lose interest pretty fast. She sticks with it though, and she gets good at it, so that at the end of the summer Luke caves and finally allows her to do one on him, like she\u2019s been begging to for months.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asks, when he sits down next to her on the ledge of the ziggaraut, and he starts to say, <em>I don\u2019t know</em>, but then he catches himself, thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d he says, \u201ccan we do this tomorrow? I have to get you a reference.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Din\u2019s asleep, shirtless and rumpled in Luke\u2019s sheets, dark hair a mess against the pillows from how Luke tugged at it earlier, Luke slips over to the pile of his armor and takes a picture of his pauldron.</p>\n<p>In the morning, when he slides his tablet to Tionne, she gives him a knowing look and says, \u201cYou better keep this secret, or Kyp is going to win the pool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke, who prefers to think that his padawans have not been betting on his love life, crosses his heart solemnly. \u201cI promise, if you do a good job with this, you\u2019ll win the bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>She does a perfect job.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s the first one to see it, mostly because Tionne has forbidden Luke to put a shirt on for at least three hours, and he\u2019s taken to hiding in the comms room. \u201cIs that a mudhorn?\u201d she demands, leaning forward to squint at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says. \u201cIt\u2019s a family crest, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia pins him with a stare. \u201cWhat family would that be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke scratches the back of his neck, blushing. \u201cYou should probably take my name out of the Senate marriage draft,\u201d he says, instead of a direct answer. \u201cI think I\u2019m about to marry the king of Mandalore.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Leia\u2019s done yelling and Luke\u2019s done swearing her to secrecy on the subject, she sighs and says, \u201cWell, at least this makes my marriage to Han look a lot better. At least we\u2019re not ancient, mortal enemies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her gaze turns soft, looking at him. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d she asks. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019re happy, Luke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says, not bothering to hide his smile. \u201cYeah, Leia, I\u2019m really happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Luke, because he\u2019s never had an overabundance of patience no matter what he preaches to his students, takes his shirt off at the same time that Din takes his helmet off.</p>\n<p>Din freezes with his helmet in his hands, staring at the mudhorn crest on Luke\u2019s chest. His eyes move from the tattoo to Luke\u2019s eyes, and something in his expression is guarded, like he\u2019s protecting himself against some flood of emotion.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It takes all the wind out of Luke\u2019s sails, and for a second he wonders \u2014 did he misjudge the situation? is he being too forward? does Din want this as much as he does?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>But he\u2019s already come this far, so he swallows, his heartbeat thundering in the quiet of their room, and says, \u201cDin. Marry me. Will you marry me?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that didn\u2019t come out right, it was too clumsy, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cLuke,</em>\u201d Din says, like every other word has been erased from his mind. \u201cYou \u2014 yes. <em>Yes.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Tangled together in bed, sweaty, sated, the skin around Luke\u2019s tattoo swollen with love bites, Din murmurs the words into the close secret space between their face, and Luke murmurs them back: <em>Mhi solus tome, mhi solus dar\u2019tome, mhi me\u2019dinui an, mhi ba\u2019juri verde. </em>He probably butchers the pronunciation, but there\u2019s no one here to hear except Din, who doesn\u2019t seem to care \u2014 who bites into his mouth before he\u2019s even finished the last word.</p>"
