Sorry for leaving it off here? This has been in the works for a while.<br>I finally FINALLY learned my lesson as a writer, and I've gotten essentially all of the concluding chapter written already and just need to edit and add a scene or two, so expect to see that next Sunday.<br>Thanks for reading, and commenting if you do that! I love you guys, and I swear I am also working on my WIPs ;)<br>OVERCOME CHIHOKO<br>AND ALL MISCOMMUNICATION<br>I have a <a href=\"https://kiaronna.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> tumblr </a> and you should have a nice day</p>\n<p>Me: Ahh, I think Yurio's cat is named Sasha. I'll go with that. *posts chapter*<br>Tumblr: *ten seconds later, while I'm browsing* Yurio's cat is named Potya!!<br>me: are u kidding me<br>I have changed the name of Yurio's cat. This is a big announcement, friends, because cats are great and should be respected.<br>Hope you enjoy the chapter.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for sticking with me through this long chapter, and I hope you enjoyed it.<br>I really value your comments, and I am about to go through and respond to all of last chapter's. Thanks so much for the interest and feedback!<br>I've decided to start a new hobby where, with every chapter I post, I highlight a fanfic I've really enjoyed and direct you people to it. <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/9392441\" rel=\"nofollow\">magpies</a> by winchilsea is beautiful and lovely prose, and I recommend that author to anyone, so please check them out if you have the time.<br>Also, I have a <a href=\"https://kiaronna.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> tumblr</a> so come say hi if you'd like!<br>Final bonus: I had a reader (if you want me to put your name here, contact me and I'll do it, I just didn't want to do it without your permission) talk to me about Viktor finding Yuuri's phone number in his phone after the first banquet, and how he dealt with that. They proposed that he'd deleted it because he named it 'Life and Love' and didn't get understand in the morning, which is hilarious and better than my original idea, which was just that he assumed he'd gotten it at another skating competition but also didn't understand why it was initially typed out as \"Katsuki Yuuri (delicious, put him ona pollle)\" courtesy of drunken Viktor.</p>",
  "text": "<p>When his father had said there was a foreigner in the onsen, this had not been what Yuuri was expecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Feltsman,\u201d he squeaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki,\u201d the Russian coach greets, gripping tighter at the towel around his waist. It may be April, and snowing, but the onsen is always warm. He looks Yuuri up and down, lingers at his stomach. \u201cIt seems you\u2019ve let yourself go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri flinches. \u201cAhh. Yes. Sir. Why are you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would like some clothes, before we have this conversation,\u201d Feltsman replies, gruff. \u201cAnd perhaps some dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, it\u2019s set before him, with Hiroko cheerfully bustling about in the background. After two bites, he sets down his spoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s excellent,\u201d he compliments Hiroko, who waves a hand and presses the other to her blushing cheek. \u201cNow on to business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cB-business?\u201d Yuuri asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, business. One of my skaters, Georgi Popovich, has made the decision to retire this season rather than continue to compete against my other student. I\u2019ve been made aware of your recent break with Celestino Cialdini after your low ranking at Japanese Nationals and the GPF. I would like to offer you a trial period where you train under me, in St. Petersburg. There are only three conditions: you will board with another one of my students, you will take ballet with Madame Baranovskaya, and you will help me coach Yuri Plisetsky, who refuses to listen to my criticisms of his spins.\u201d Yakov nods at this point, leans forwards and looks Yuuri in the eye. \u201cI will charge no coaching fees.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Japanese skater nearly faints on the spot. \u201cSir. This is extremely generous. I have to ask\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me why, boy,\u201d Yakov lets out in a booming sigh. \u201cYou take good things when they\u2019re offered, if they\u2019re something you desire. You don\u2019t ask why they landed in your lap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Yuuri breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need time to think about this, Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>A world-class coach, showing up at his door and offering a chance to make a comeback to the world of skating after his shameful showing at the Sochi GPF? There\u2019s no logical reason to hesitate, no reason to say no, if he wants figure skating in his life.</p>\n<p>Yuuri hesitates.</p>\n<p>Because Yakov Feltsman might be offering to coach Yuuri, but there\u2019s another man he coaches. The man Yuuri idolizes. The man Yuuri has loved\u2014in many ways\u2014starting from his first glimpse of him at twelve years old. The man who, even when Phichit pushed and pushed and\u00a0<em>finally</em> convinced Yuuri to send a tentative Instagram message, had only responded back with a message clearly written for him by his public relations department.</p>\n<p>Yes, Yakov Feltsman coaches Viktor Nikiforov, and Viktor Nikiforov is the man who\u2019d promised Yuuri everything he\u2019d ever dreamed, everything he didn\u2019t deserve, at the GPF banquet in Sochi.</p>\n<p>Then, he never called.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, love for skating\u2014for Viktor, too\u2014 wins.</p>\n<p>Feltsman already has a contract written up and printed out. Yuuri signs it with no complaints, and starts to pack. Board with another skater, train with Madame Baranovskaya, train with Yuri Plisetsky. Some people would kill to do the second. Some people would die by doing the third, dealing with the vicious younger skater, but they\u2019d do it happily. And the first\u2014well, Phichit had been Yuuri\u2019s only friend in Detroit. Maybe he and his new roommate can become close, if he\u2019s lucky. He realizes, belatedly, that judging by the people Yakov coaches, that his roommate will probably be Plisetsky himself. Yuuri debates taking some kind of weapon along for self defense.</p>\n<p>Overall, Minako is delighted with the news. She writes a letter to Madame Baranovskaya (\u201cdon\u2019t you have email?\u201d The triplets question, shocked. \u201cYou do not <em>email</em> Madame Baranovskaya,\u201d Minako replies darkly) and sends Yuuri off with a tight squeeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve this,\u201d she says, \u201cremember that.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a second try, at Yuuri\u2019s skating career. Yuuri may not deserve it, but he\u2019s good at trying things again. And again. And again. So he follows Yakov Feltsman to Saint Petersburg, skates and body and soul, and hopes this time he can be better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t know what to expect, as he ascends the narrow yet elegant staircase. Yakov had given him this address, and Yuuri had wandered past the street signs in Cyrillic that he couldn\u2019t read, following his phone\u2019s directions blindly. It\u2019s snowing, despite the time of year\u2014it\u2019s always snowing in Saint Petersburg, if Viktor\u2019s Instagram posts are anything to go by. Yuuri goes by them religiously.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only a few apartments in the building he\u2019s come to, but they\u2019re <em>expensive</em>, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that Yuri Plisetsky, rebellious fifteen year old, emerged from this extravagance. Admittedly, Yuuri knows next to nothing about his family. The complex feels familiar, though, like he\u2019s seen it in photographs.</p>\n<p>Checking the email from Yakov on his phone screen one last time, and confirming the floor of the loft he\u2019ll be sharing, he raises his knuckles to rap at the door\u2014there\u2019s a scrambling then, a scratching of nails on tile, and a surprisingly light thud against the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he says. Apparently, Yuuri doesn\u2019t need to knock, because the door swings open and over a hundred pounds of tan curls and pink tongue are on him; the only thing that\u2019s not on him anymore is his glasses. It\u2019s hard to be too upset with such an excited welcome, though. He ruffles his hands through the curls, kisses the dog\u2019s blurry nose, and laughs. \u201cHello. Who are you? You look just like\u2026\u201d He cuts off, rubs at the dog a little more softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about her,\u201d a voice interrupts, amused, and Yuuri looks up with a squint. \u201cYou\u2019re Yuuri, yes? Please come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other man is wearing a blue hat, and is slim but taller than him. This is all that Yuuri, completely blind, is managing to gather.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Sorry, do you see my\u2026\u201d the other man bends over, slides them smoothly onto Yuuri\u2019s face, and everything snaps into focus with dizzying clarity. \u201cGlasses,\u201d Yuuri chokes out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Viktor Nikiforov, in the flesh.</p>\n<p>Viktor Nikiforov, his childhood idol and crush rolled up into one tall and smiling and gorgeous package.</p>\n<p>Viktor Nikiforov, who he drunkenly danced with and put his hands all over at the Sochi GPF, who asked for his number and then never, ever called him. Yuuri hadn\u2019t been waiting, not at all. He\u2019d suspected, when he woke up the next morning with sore thighs from the pole and a heavy head and a clear memory of Viktor\u2019s hand warm and damp in his, that the other man probably would never want to see him again.</p>\n<p>But now they\u2019re standing three feet apart, and it dawns on Yuuri that Viktor is intended to be his <em>flatmate</em>. Rooming with another student, Yakov had said, and Yuuri had assumed he meant Yuri Plisetsky. Foolishly, foolishly assumed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going white,\u201d Viktor says, \u201cdid Makkachin manage to make you hit your head? I\u2019m sorry, she gets excited.\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go back\u2014to Mr. Feltsman\u2019s office,\u201d Yuuri blurts. Viktor blinks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov\u2019s already gone home, I\u2019m sure. You\u2019ll have to wait for tomorrow.\u201d He glances behind Yuuri, catches sight of the single suitcase. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of your luggage?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s tongue feels swollen. \u201cUm,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand out here,\u201d Viktor says, brows furrowing, \u201cyou can come in. This will be your home, too.\u201d He puts a finger to his lips. \u201cAh, I forgot to have another set of keys made for you. Yuri stole my second set. We\u2019ll drop by a hardware store tomorrow, after practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri still hasn\u2019t managed to say anything. Viktor is still passively standing there, looking soft in a blue beanie and stretched out sweats that are slung low over his hips, his hand resting casually on the doorframe.</p>\n<p>Deep breath. He can speak English. He spoke English for five years in Detroit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d He finally asks, looking Viktor in the eye for however long he dares. The situation is awkward. He\u2019s sure it\u2019s undeniable to the other man: Yuuri is a huge fan, and he\u2019d told him so, <em>repeatedly</em>, after the banquet, whispered and giggling confessions of <em>you changed my life when I was twelve, I love you, you were floating and unreal and beautiful, I\u2019ve always wanted to catch you and hold you </em>to wide blue eyes. And for that night, just for one precious night, Viktor had let him. Let him catch, and hold, and seemed eager to let him.</p>\n<p>Now, he\u2019s acting like they\u2019ve only met in passing. Yuuri supposes that, besides the night of the banquet, that is true. He feels foolish. Twelve years of adoration on his side, and one drunken night on Viktor\u2019s\u2014that can\u2019t add up to a balance, can\u2019t be equal. Yuuri\u2019s sure the other man has had plenty of nights that were more enjoyable, steamier than a few rounds of tango and stumbling childishly through the halls after, cheek to cheek, until they found the hotel\u2019s abandoned ballroom and danced again there, slower. Heavier. Chins pressed into the other\u2019s shoulder, swaying, Viktor\u2019s pale fingers creeping beneath his jacket to thumb gently at the soft skin of his hip, but no farther. Alcohol, swirling over him like dark incense blown by the wind. Viktor, trembling in his arms and nudging in closer, closer, with every step, reeling him in pleadingly after every turn in the dance like Yuuri was going to float off into the darkness and never come back. <em>I\u2019ve never met anyone like you</em>.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shouldn\u2019t have remembered. Shouldn\u2019t have done this in front of Viktor. Shouldn\u2019t have come to Russia at all, no matter how free the coaching had been.</p>\n<p>Is this okay?</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Viktor says brightly, cocking his head as though the question is silly. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble to go get a set of keys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor shows him around the flat, through the minimalist d\u00e9cor that Yuuri is already terrified of getting his fingerprints on or knocking off of the glass shelves. Viktor waves cheerily at Yuuri\u2019s new bedroom, \u201cacross the hall from mine, so grab me if you need me,\u201d shows him the modest collection of vegetables in the crisper drawer of the fridge, and turns on the showerhead in Yuuri\u2019s bathroom for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one,\u201d he admits, twisting at it. \u201cI\u2019ve almost forgotten how to use it, and it\u2019s my own house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor is a god on the ice. He\u2019s going to be a good flatmate, too, Yuuri can tell. Maybe, if Yuuri can swallow these feelings down deep enough into him, dig his fingernails into his palms enough that it hurts more than pretending that night never happened, he can enjoy this time. Invigorate his skating, by being around Viktor, the man he still respects and admires more than anything. Yuuri had been sucked into a whirlpool of his own anxiety, but he always tries to escape it.</p>\n<p>The guest room\u2019s lightbulb is out. Viktor looks sheepish, flicking at the switch with a sigh and then a careless shrug. \u201cAh,\u201d he says. Yuuri looks deeper into the room\u2014there\u2019s no cobwebs, but the room screams <em>unused</em>\u2014the paint perfect, the closet packed neatly with boxes so clothes can\u2019t be stored. \u201cI\u2019ll move them out,\u201d Viktor promises. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in here for so long, I forgot I\u2019d filled the closet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri flicks at the switch four times with trembling fingers. He can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s excited, or terrified, or both.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go to bed now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor glances at his watch. Yuuri doesn\u2019t recognize the brand, but he wouldn\u2019t, see as how three months ago he was a college student who had won a meager amount of skating competitions and dressed in ratty free T-shirts from skate club events. The watch is made of gold. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? It\u2019s early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI go to bed early, most of the time,\u201d Yuuri admits. \u201c\u2026Though I don\u2019t necessarily sleep, once there.\u201d He taps at his phone, and there\u2019s a quirk to Viktor\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did try to look you up on social media,\u201d he says, and Yuuri freezes. <em>After we danced? Did you look for me? Why? Did you ever want\u2014</em> \u201cI thought I\u2019d see what my new flatmate would be like, after Yakov told me he thought I needed one and said he would provide. Alas, your last Instagram picture was nearly two years ago, and that one was\u2026\u201c he considers for a moment. The Japanese skater realizes which account the other man had found.</p>\n<p>Yuuri covers his eyes with one hand. It had been a very, very badly photoshopped version of two men at an alter, his face slapped onto one and Viktor\u2019s onto the other. He\u2019d been drunk when he made it, posted it, he\u2019d been <em>joking</em> because, well, Viktor would never <em>marry</em> him, but a drunken Phichit thought it was hilarious, <em>don\u2019t delete it, Yuuri, this is amazing! Someday Viktor will see it and realize you two are MEANT TO BE</em>!</p>\n<p>Drunk Yuuri had agreed, and changed his account passwords to something that sober Yuuri had yet to figure out. He\u2019d made new accounts, and Phichit had used his magical social media powers to bury it as much as he could, but it was online, if you looked for his name.</p>\n<p><em>Oh. God.</em> \u201cMy friend hacked me,\u201d he lies, desperately. <em>My friend being me, with two bottles of vodka in my bloodstream.</em> \u201cThat\u2019s an old account. I have a new one now, though I don\u2019t use it a lot.\u201d Viktor nods with a slight, cut off laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d He stretches then, a light gesture, one hand clasping at his other arm\u2019s elbow above his head as he arches with a dreamy sigh. Smooth, effortless, and devastatingly attractive. Yuuri thinks, for a moment, that things will be okay, that he\u2019ll just exist in close proximity to Viktor and get to appreciate him, but then Viktor\u2019s arms drop and his mouth opens. \u201cI was a huge fan of Lambiel when I was young\u2014Mila and Georgi always teased me about marrying him, no matter how ridiculous that was, decorated my skate locker with hearts and magazine cutouts of him, once.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost funny. Yuuri can think of three occasions off the top of his head where Phichit or Yuuko had done something similar, and he\u2019s about to share, but it dies on the tip of his tongue. Viktor <em>knows</em>, knows the degree to which Yuuri has a desperate crush on him, probably amusedly remembers his drunken confessions from the banquet night, probably tells stories to his Russian friends. <em>The guy who crashed and burned at the GPF had a crush on me. It was kind of cute, he was such a sloppy drunk! Followed me around like a lost puppy at the banquet, though I don\u2019t know why they let him in! What, be interested in him? Never.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d he says, the flatness of his voice belying the oncoming wave of panic and shame. <em>Let me come with you</em>, Viktor had said. <em>Let me come back to your room.</em> His head rolling soft over the knotted muscles in Yuuri\u2019s leg, pillowed on Yuuri\u2019s lap in the empty ballroom. Yuuri can\u2019t have imagined that. \u201cYou could\u2014\u201c he murmurs, unconsciously seeking some kind of reassurance, but he stops himself. Viktor knows he\u2019s a fan. Viktor seems intent on not bringing the banquet up. Viktor doesn\u2019t want now what he wanted then, and everything is already awkward enough.</p>\n<p>The other man waits, finger tapping lightly on his waist before he takes one step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d Close-lipped smile. \u201cGood night, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shuts the door.</p>\n<p>His fingers dart to his phone before he can help it, pull up the all too familiar folder and flick through it like some kind of coping mechanism. But this, this longing\u2014it\u2019s not coping. He\u2019s not coping, not at all.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s smile, so bright and free, his hand on Yuuri\u2019s cheek. Letting Yuuri dip him until they were breathless, leaning into him like he trusted Yuuri implicitly, impossibly, like Yuuri was a tree in a thunderless, drenching storm and the only cover for miles.</p>\n<p>Burying his mouth into his new pillow, Yuuri cries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri wakes to rapping on his door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d the voice comes through, \u201cYuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s imagined Viktor saying his name a million times since the night of the banquet, but rarely like this, impatient and pressing and\u2014okay, he <em>has</em> imagined it like this, but never for this reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late. I don\u2019t want to barge in, but I\u2019ve got an apple and some milk for you, and Yakov <em>will</em> make us do suicides if you\u2019re late on your first day.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201cHe\u2019ll make <em>you</em> do suicides.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri opens the door. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to?\u201d He realizes after that the question is stupid. Viktor is Yakov\u2019s star pupil\u2014the man probably caters to him, or at least that\u2019s how the magazine articles frame it.</p>\n<p>Viktor laughs. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to convince me it\u2019s worth the practice time.\u201d The blue eyes flicker down, then.</p>\n<p>Yuuri realizes, with a sinking heart, that his shirt has ridden up in his sleep, revealing his slightly pudgy belly. He hadn\u2019t stopped skating for long, but it didn\u2019t take long to put back on the weight, and he\u2019d been stressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe suicides are necessary,\u201d Viktor hums. Yuuri flinches. After he\u2019s changed in his room, Viktor hands him the apple and milk, and Yuuri chugs the milk but <em>does not</em> eat the apple in Viktor\u2019s car, because <em>it is a pink sports car</em>. It\u2019s probably worth more than anything Yuuri has ever earned, combined.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me,\u201d he says, when they get out of the car and Viktor\u2019s swinging his athletic bag over his shoulder from the trunk. \u201cI\u2019m used to walking or riding public transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor props his sunglasses on the crest of his head, shrugs and gives a beatific smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to the same place, won\u2019t we?\u201d Yuuri feels dazzled, and unable to argue.</p>\n<p>They are late.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to make you run anyway,\u201d Yakov grunts, \u201cbut we\u2019ll add on suicides to the five miles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d is all Yuuri can reply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries, helplessly, to set down his towel over the leather seats, so he doesn\u2019t have to sit his sweaty and disgusting bottom half onto Viktor\u2019s pristine car. Viktor gives him a curious look, and slides in. There\u2019s a bead of sweat\u2014exactly one\u2014that rolls down from his forehead, leaving a shining trail. It hangs, precarious and a perfect teardrop, from his jawline before it drops as a wet kiss onto Viktor\u2019s grey practice shirt, right above where his nipple hides. Heartstopping. Yuuri feels like a pile of trash left on a street corner on a hot and sunny day.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit,\u201d the other man chuckles. Yuuri sits. \u201cSo you stay late, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri sneaks a look at Viktor\u2019s watch, glinting on his wrist against the wheel. He can already feel the buzz of anxiety rising again, the urge to get on the ice or into a studio palpable in his chest. It\u2019s only six o\u2019 clock. Yuuri wishes he\u2019d been given a rink instead of a guest room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says instead. Viktor arches an eyebrow and lets it go. This, perhaps, is the most contradicting thing about him. Viktor is talkative, yes\u2014he hadn\u2019t stopped on the way to the rink in the morning\u2014but the silence with him is relaxing, unstrained, surprisingly communicative. He doesn\u2019t mind the quiet\u2014almost seems to appreciate it, sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov seems to have high expectations for you,\u201d Viktor interrupts his thoughts casually. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t stop looking over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had been incredibly perplexed by this. Yakov Feltsman was a very incomprehensible man, to Yuuri. When they\u2019d discussed the contract and what would happen when he reached St. Petersburg, Yakov had fired off rink rules: no phones, no <em>alcohol</em> (Yuuri had flinched at that, knowing Yakov had been exposed to him at the banquet), no kissing or horseplay or <em>anything sexual</em> on the ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Yuuri had assured him, dazedly. Yakov had grunted, scoffed something out in Russian, as though Yuuri\u2014anxious, shy, chubby Yuuri, who broke down at the last GPF\u2014was going to be seducing skaters left and right and pressing them up against the boards for make-out sessions. Incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>But the way he\u2019d looked between Yuuri and Viktor\u2014like he\u2019d <em>expected</em> something. Not Yuuri\u2019s skating, no\u2014the expression on his face when Yuuri skated was something entirely different.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been practicing since the GPF, boy?\u201d He\u2019d asked loudly, when most of the other skaters were gone, Viktor had headed off to the weight room, and Yuuri was absorbed by the music in his own head on the ice. Yuuri had winced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m out of practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yakov had corrected bluntly, \u201cno, your spins and jumps were <em>better</em>, just now. Better than I\u2019ve seen them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yakov would find out eventually, if this trial period managed to last to a competition. \u201cI\u2026 get nervous. At competitions.\u201d This was possibly the mildest explanation he could give. It was enough.</p>\n<p>Yakov had just stood there, mouth slightly ajar and head tilted. \u201cI see,\u201d he concluded finally. \u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t realize you were that kind of skater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri had apologized instantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Yakov said, raising one hand. \u201cI should have figured it out. Nobody takes third during the short program at the GPF, coming off a silver and gold from the qualifying competitions, and then does a free program like that, unless\u2026 hey!\u201d The tears are already brimming. Celestino hadn\u2019t seen Yuuri cry until the third week, and he\u2019d slapped him on the back and offered him a bottle of water, sat with him on the bleachers while they discussed expectations. Yakov\u2019s approach is, instead, to command brusquely, blustering, \u201cdon\u2019t cry! I\u2019m not insulting you. People were expecting you to medal in Sochi, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri hadn\u2019t been expecting to medal.</p>\n<p>Yakov sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing at my rink,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can absorb some of the cocky confidence from the others. Maybe they\u2019ll learn something from you, too.\u201d He pursed his lips. \u201cOn that subject, you\u2019ll meet Plisetsky tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had tried to tell Yakov that they\u2019d already met. Yuri Plisetsky, the boy that had yelled at him in the bathroom after his failure, was unlikely to be thrilled that Yuuri was helping to <em>coach</em> him. Yakov had brushed this off.</p>\n<p>Yakov had <em>expectations</em>. Yuuri\u2019s not sure what those expectations are, yet.</p>\n<p>In the car with Viktor, Yuuri manages to start a conversation. \u201cDo you know Yuri Plisetsky?\u201d</p>\n<p>The corners of Viktor\u2019s mouth stretch up. It seems wrong. \u201cOh! Yes. He\u2019s very fierce. Quite adorable. He hasn\u2019t realized that he needs to practice to keep up in the Senior division, though. We\u2019ll have to call him something else, now that you\u2019re here. Yurio, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri slides down a bit in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov wants me to work with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor doesn\u2019t even try to hide his laughter. \u201cI wish you the best of luck, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Yuuri doesn\u2019t need it. What he had <em>needed</em> was a corner of the rink to himself for a few moments after practice the next day, doing figures and musing on his jumps, but as he moves into a lazy Biellmann Yuri Plisetsky takes the ice.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> think you can coach <em>me</em>?\u201d He demands, finger less than an inch from Yuuri\u2019s face. Yuuri wonders if he had ever been so difficult as a teenager, and seriously doubts it. He\u2019d essentially been raised as an employee of the customer service industry. So he sighs, and ignores the unmerited hostility.</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov decided this was a good idea, and Yakov is our coach. If he thinks you have something to learn from me, he\u2019s probably right.\u201d The blond\u2019s expression sours further, if even possible. Yuuri feels the need for damage control. \u201cThough, I\u2019ve noticed you have the Salchow down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri snorts. \u201cYes. Better than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we could trade skills?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHardly a fair trade!\u201d Yuri announces, but he slides closer to Yuuri with a determined ferocity. \u201cTeach me your step sequence from last season.\u201d</p>\n<p>The one that had Plisetsky yelling at him afterwards in a toilet stall? Yuuri wants to say <em>no way</em>. Instead he launches towards the open ice, with Plisetsky at the back of his blades. They\u2019ve been at it for twenty minutes, Yuri already bafflingly familiar with the steps, before Yuuri notices Yakov, clipboard in hand, watching from the side of the rink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Sir.\u201d He stops, and Yuuri scratches to a halt beside him. \u201cDid you want us to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>is</em> what I wanted you to do. So stop talking to me, and keep doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>They go on, and on, and on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Madame Baranovskaya reads his letter from Minako, on Yuuri\u2019s first day. The turn of her mouth sours slightly. Yuuri hadn\u2019t thought she could disapprove further.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are passable,\u201d she says to Yuuri, and Yuuri can see the widening of the eyes of several nearby danseurs and does not understand, in his panic, what that could mean. \u201cThis is why I agreed to take you. But I am not Minako. I will break you. You will dance differently, for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can only nod, completely lost. Then she claps her hands, and he loses himself in the music.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On their first rest day, Yuuri\u2019s not quite sure what to do. If it was Phichit, they\u2019d hunker down on their old torn-up couch and watch terrible old Japanese or American films while Phichit presented him with the highlights from the world news that week. They\u2019d eat yogurt with fruit and pretend it was ice cream, and Phichit would wheedle and prod until Yuuri put on The King and the Skater II, with English subtitles, dubbed in a random language. The French version was Phichit\u2019s second favorite, beaten out only by his own native tongue. He swore that the songs sounded different.</p>\n<p>Yuuri misses him, so desperately it closes up his throat. Maybe this is why he dares to meander into the living room, peers hesitantly at Viktor\u2019s expensive flatscreen and nudges experimentally at the remote.</p>\n<p>Viktor, of course, walks in with a half-eaten carrot aloft in his hand, and notices.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want to watch something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor turns on the television anyway. \u201cI have Netflix, I think. Mila told me to try it.\u201d He sits on the couch, gestures beside him. Yuuri perches hesitantly on the other end. \u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s answer is vague, and Viktor settles easily on some comedy, plays it in English.</p>\n<p>The Japanese skater <em>likes</em> movies. He also likes movement, which is calming. During a slower scene, he pads off to his room and comes back with a deck of cards. Viktor peers at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSolitaire,\u201d Yuuri explains. Viktor watches, points at opportunities. When Yuuri sets the last card down Viktor claps in mild excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never finished solitaire before.\u201d A pause. \u201cDo you want to play another game?\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, Yuuri should have known better. Viktor is a world champion, and you don\u2019t earn that title without a certain competitive nature. He smacks at Yuuri\u2019s hands mercilessly when they play Slapjack and distracts him with strange stories about his exploits as a teenager during Go Fish, until Yuuri is laughing and laughing, conceding victory rather than bringing out his own competitive nature. They\u2019ve sprawled out on the living room floor, movie forgotten in the background, and when Yuuri shuffles the cards Viktor asks to be taught the technique, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do a simple bridge for you,\u201d Yuuri feels brave enough to tease. \u201cYou\u2019re a novice.\u201d Viktor scoots closer, strong hands curling over the deck of cards, and without thinking Yuuri leans in, corrects them with his own. \u201cGently. You\u2019ll scatter them everywhere, like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks up, a mistake, because Viktor\u2019s face is too close, expression soft and sleepy and pleased. Yuuri can feel the heat rising in his cheeks\u2014he takes his hands back, tucks them into his hoodie pockets.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s expression is no longer sleepy. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he requests, almost <em>coy</em>, and Yuuri wishes he could scramble back, could prevent Viktor from hearing the pounding of his heart against his ribcage.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to learn how to do things on your own,\u201d he scolds, and he doesn\u2019t mean it, and Viktor knows this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to do that,\u201d Viktor replies, tone distant. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri wants to ask him what he means, but those perfect, pale hands are too strong. Cards spray out onto the carpet, into the air, flutter over Yuuri\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor!\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou did that on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I promise.\u201d The other man\u2019s softness is back, an implacable expression flickering over his face. Yuuri can\u2019t bear to look. Yuuri starts scooping the cards up together, and as he does, he mumbles,</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a game.\u201d Viktor hums in response to that, a question, and Yuuri continues, \u201cit\u2019s called fifty three card pickup. Whoever has the most cards wins.\u201d Viktor freezes, and from the corner of his eyes Yuuri can see him opening his mouth, opening it to ask. \u201cI\u2019m going to win this round.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor is moving in a flash, pulling cards towards him. Yuuri yanks at them, pulls them from beneath Viktor\u2019s palms and his knees, where the Russian is shoving them for safekeeping.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheater!\u201d Viktor protests, breathless, \u201cHow scandalous, that you have to resort to cheating to beat me at your own game, Yuuri!\u201d His pale cheeks have the lightest flush.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cheating!\u201d He laughs in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>is</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a shine to his eyes that Yuuri hasn\u2019t seen since the banquet, and it gives him confidence.</p>\n<p>Yuuri straightens, looks over Viktor\u2019s shoulder, towards the apartment door. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Viktor pauses suspiciously, his hand on the Queen of Hearts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMakkachin\u2019s got ahold of your new scarf.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s on his feet too quickly, turning\u2014Makkachin, perfectly innocent, peers up at him from where she\u2019s cuddled next to a heating vent. Yuuri swears he hears the lightest gasp. But it\u2019s too late for the champion.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That</em>,\u201d Yuuri\u00a0 says, \u201c<em>that</em> is cheating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor looks down at him\u2014Yuuri, in his sweats, hair sticking up, stretched out awkwardly towards the last card on the ground a distance away. He\u2019s already collected the cards Viktor used to have pressed beneath his knees. It\u2019s a royal mess. But Viktor Nikiforov is laughing, then, low and rumbling and genuinely appreciative.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s done, Viktor crouches, leans in. \u201cI think, overall, that I won this round of games.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t look at his eyes</em>. Yuuri always drowns in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cFifty three cards,\u201d he says, in a wobbly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s fifty three victories. More than you get, for winning Go Fish three times and Slapjack five times and Euchre six times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, but you admitted that you cheated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri feels them before he registers them fully, the fingers at his pulse point. They\u2019re climbing curiously up the underside of his wrist, his forearm, and the feeling shoots like electricity straight through his veins.</p>\n<p>He looks up into the blue eyes. \u201cViktor?\u201d The fingers stop, drop sweetly from his skin, and Viktor sits back on the carpet.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeach me the bridge again?\u201d he requests. His fringe falls gently over one eye, the other still locked onto Yuuri\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>He pushes the deck towards the other man, and feels a sickening d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Yuuri\u2019s been exposed to a look like this before\u2014all slightly stunned interest, a growing crescendo of excitement. That had been at the start of the banquet, before it deepened and solidified into pure longing. The start of the banquet, the banquet that faded away after like the interest had been fairydust, magic sprinkled over the evening, disappearing when it was over.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s fingers are on him again. \u201cShow me?\u201d He requests, a thumb skimming over Yuuri\u2019s knuckles. \u201cYuuri, show me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri bites his tongue till he tastes blood, tries to steady his hands, and does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yakov comes to them with two videos.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor has choreographed two routines,\u201d he says, gruffly. \u201cHe no longer identifies with them, and must skate something that has finally caught his inspiration, or so he squealed at me this morning. I have to deal with his infuriating arrogance, but you two will benefit from it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe choreographed it for me?\u201d Yurio demands.</p>\n<p>Yakov gives him a strange look. \u201cNo.\u201d The younger skater immediately begins mashing violently at the buttons on his phone. \u201cYour grandfather worries when you text him like that, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>not talking to him about it</em>,\u201d Yurio snaps. \u201cI am asking him something else.\u201d Yuuri vaguely has the thought that Yurio needs a friend his own age to text and rage to, but Yuuri isn\u2019t one to talk. His own texts are limited to Phichit, Mari, and now Viktor, apparently, who has texted him three times since they arrived at practice in the morning, despite eating lunch with Yuuri.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could text me?\u201d He ventures.</p>\n<p>The response is immediately. \u201cShove a skate up your ass.\u201d That earns them both three suicides.</p>\n<p>The response is equally immediate later, though, when a picture of a long-haired cat finds its way to Yuuri\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p><em>She looks so happy in the windowsill</em>, Yuuri texts back.</p>\n<p><em>Of course she is, idiot, she\u2019s a cat,</em> comes the instant reply. <em>Cats are amazing. Send me pictures of your stupid dog. I know you have one.</em></p>\n<p>Yuuri takes a while, to respond to that.</p>\n<p><em>Not anymore,</em> he finally texts. There is an equally long wait for Yurio\u2019s next text.</p>\n<p><em>Come meet Sasha sometime,</em> he says, <em>I\u2019ll teach you proper Russian food while you\u2019re here, cause Viktor has horrible taste. Pirozhki. Remember pirozhki. They\u2019re all you need in life.</em></p>\n<p>Saint Petersburg is very cold, even in April.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you texting?\u201d Viktor asks. There\u2019s the subtlest pout to his mouth. \u201cWhen you weren\u2019t texting me earlier, too, how cruel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was in practice,\u201d Yuuri laughs. \u201cSo were you. And it\u2019s Yuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>By May, it\u2019s surprisingly warm. Yuuri can almost forget Sochi.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Madame Baranovskaya only scowls at him, during practice. He\u2019s been having nightmares. About her, and about other things.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to come into my studio,\u201d she says, \u201cyou will have to learn to dance properly, even when your body is weighted with emotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll work it off,\u201d he assures her, ashamed, \u201cmadame. I\u2019ll do it faster in the future, I apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>The displeasure only grows in her eyes. \u201cI do not ask you to toss your emotions away\u2014they are worth their weight. I am telling you to utilize them.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is an ideology he\u2019s taken to the ice for years. So Yuuri does. His guest room is empty enough, and the floors are wooden, so at night in socks and his pajamas he dances with his emotion. He\u2019s been working up the courage to ask Yakov for after-hours access to the rink. For now, this will do. Plie, tour en l\u2019air, grand jete. Arabesque and detourne. When he needs a change it comes easy in flamenco steps, and a tango for one.</p>\n<p>One night he opens his eyes, with panting breaths, to Viktor: standing in the open doorway with two steaming mugs and wide eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTea,\u201d the other man says, \u201cwith jam. No. Mine has jam. Yours doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shuffles over, tousles at the hair over his eyes self-consciously. He\u2019d been doing a tango for one. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine that Viktor sees the resemblance to the banquet night too, which is probably why he\u2019s tapping at his mug with one finger, troubled, eyes locked on Yuuri\u2019s sweaty frame. Yuuri sips at his drink, half sick with shame.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um, I really appreciate this, but I\u2019m actually very warm from practicing\u2014\u201c he begins, so quiet, but Viktor is on his feet in moments.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get water,\u201d the Russian asserts quickly. Anything to escape the man who still spends his nights reliving their banquet dance, is all that Yuuri can imagine.</p>\n<p>He still returns anyway, nearly shoves a new cup into Yuuri\u2019s outstretched hands. The rapid motion has Yuuri spilling some on his pajama top. They stare at the growing stain together, and Yuuri squeezes his eyes shut slowly as it seeps across the fabric on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he breathes finally, \u201cI have to change my shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d is Viktor\u2019s calm response. Yuuri fiddles at the hem, and his eyes dart up.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, do you\u2026 mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d the Russian laughs, \u201cof course.\u201d He makes to leave the room, and Yuuri watches him go, so collected and beautiful, still clothed in a sweater and expensive, soft sweats. Yuuri knows now that the other man likes to sleep shirtless.</p>\n<p><em>Stay</em>, Yuuri\u2019s whole being seems to be crying, <em>please stay</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your tea,\u201d is all that Yuuri\u2019s mouth says. Viktor circles back, shaking his head at himself, smile warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you always turn your bedroom into a ballet studio?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri lies.</p>\n<p>A chuckle at that. Viktor tilts his head, thoughtful and devastating. \u201cWe should dance together, sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri lies again. He would rather cut out his own heart from his chest with the blade of his skate. Living with Viktor is hard, sometimes. Being close to Viktor is difficult, always, even as it sends him soaring. But dancing with Viktor\u2014dancing crosses the line. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d he says woodenly.</p>\n<p>Viktor echoes it. Every line of his body seems drawn for Yuuri\u2019s eyes to roam over, every turn of his lips something private and breathtaking. It breaks Yuuri\u2019s heart. Breaks and breaks and breaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Madame Baranovskaya says one afternoon, when Yuuri is musing on it during practice, reliving the swell and ache of his chest. Even five grueling hours on the ice in the morning hadn\u2019t been enough to dissipate it, so he gives in, lets himself break rather than worry about breaking, something he can only do while dancing. \u201cThat is how you will dance for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re two months into being roommates, and on one off-day Viktor steps breezily into his room, cocks his perfect silver head, and declares: \u201cwe\u2019re going out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri is in mismatched socks and basketball shorts. \u201cTo the Chinese takeout on the corner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor shakes his head. \u201cNo, no. We\u2019re going to\u2014\u201c the next word out of his mouth isn\u2019t in English. It\u2019s definitely something flowing, something French, something <em>expensive</em>. He must see the look on Yuuri\u2019s face, because he smoothly follows it with, \u201cmy treat, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d Yuuri protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Viktor says. \u201cSo then it\u2019ll be a date?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri knows this is not what Viktor means, that \u2018date\u2019 must be a more casual, unromantic word for him. In the United States, there\u2019s a phrase like this that has only to do with scheduling, and after several moments of confused silence it bursts from his English speaking brain without much thought. \u201cIt\u2019s a date, then. But I\u2019ll try not to go overboard with ordering.\u201d</p>\n<p>The restaurant is exactly as Yuuri had feared. It\u2019s expensive, and stylish, and the owner personally stops by their table and chats with Viktor in French for a few moments while Viktor tilts his flute of red wine. Yuuri had nearly spilled his on the white silk tablecloth, earlier.</p>\n<p>Of course, Viktor insists that they have two appetizers, and the owner insists that they have dessert. They walk home, stuffed and sated, and Yuuri shivers in the cold because his blood rushes to his abdomen. Viktor, in the middle of a step, easily slides their palms together, links their fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter?\u201d He questions.</p>\n<p>It is not better. It\u2019s only making him long for something impossible, stoking a fire in him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d wanted to hold Viktor\u2019s hand again, after the banquet. He\u2019d wanted to hold it every single day, in a clenching and painful way that outpaced his former childhood crush on the man, something he\u2019d never imagined could get any worse. Yuuri had watched interviews and short videos on Instagram from Mila and Georgi and Viktor himself, desperate for pieces of the other man. So he doesn\u2019t let go. He just says, \u201cyes.\u201d Better than the last few months. Not <em>better</em>.</p>\n<p>In the dark of the apartment\u2019s entryway, Viktor slides their hands apart. Starts unwinding the scarf from around Yuuri\u2019s neck, and it makes Yuuri\u2019s lower lip tremble and his mind scream numbly. When he\u2019s done, scarf hung neatly on the coat tree, he settles hands on Yuuri\u2019s shoulders, squeezes lightly at the tense muscles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had fun.\u201d Yuuri nods. It was fun for him, too, once Viktor had\u2014 with no trace of judgment\u2014 shown him which fork was which. \u201cIt was a good date, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri waits for him to step away, to shrug off his own coat. Instead, Viktor\u2019s thumb starts lightly brushing at his neck. <em>Focus on breathing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs\u2026\u201d Yuuri can\u2019t even vocalize it, it makes such little sense. \u201cThe scarf?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor laughs through his nose, just a little. \u201cThis,\u201d he explains, and his lips are brushing at Yuuri\u2019s forehead. It\u2019s a small gesture. It\u2019s tearing Yuuri apart. He leans up, and Viktor leans down, and Yuuri is kissing him on the lips then, desperately, hopelessly.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d done this at the banquet, too, in the ballroom. Gentle, in the silence, the only music their lips moving in light rhythm. <em>I\u2019ll kiss you until you can\u2019t breathe, </em>Viktor had promised, <em>when neither of us are drunk</em>. One month after the banquet, after clinging onto hope for far too long, Yuuri had finally, finally accepted that Viktor hadn\u2019t meant it.</p>\n<p>He nips at Viktor\u2019s bottom lip, and the other man opens it with a willing, small moan, and Yuuri presses in like he\u2019d imagined doing.</p>\n<p>Viktor pulls away too quickly, tugs at the buttons on Yuuri\u2019s coat and his own. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the couch?\u201d His voice is soft, pleased, the curve of his mouth sweet, even with his lips cherry red where Yuuri had bitten at them.</p>\n<p>They kiss and kiss and kiss, tongues and fingerprints on each others necks. When the kisses slow, Viktor settles against him and curls comfortably on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never imagined,\u201d he is saying, his words vibrating over Yuuri\u2019s heart, \u201cthat this would happen, when you showed up at my door.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought they would never kiss again, never be close again?</p>\n<p>\u201cFor so long I\u2019d been\u2026 growing desperate. Life is full of all of the same things, and I was becoming one of them. Sochi was a breaking point\u2014everything was lifeless.\u201d Yuuri can almost feel his breath rattling in his lungs. Sochi. The banquet. Viktor thought it was <em>lifeless</em>. \u201cAnd now you tumble into my home, and it\u2014\u201c he punctuates this with a laugh, a chuckling kiss to Yuuri\u2019s nose, one that shudders over his skin \u201c\u2014everything\u2019s... It seems almost <em>too</em> convenient. Orchestrated by someone, you know, even though that\u2019s impossible. Just\u2026 convenient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConvenient,\u201d Yuuri repeats.</p>\n<p>It must be convenient, to have someone like Yuuri in his house, someone he can kiss and who looks at him with helpless affection. Yuuri can feel the tears welling in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Viktor looks startled at them, almost panicked. \u201cThat was too heavy, wasn\u2019t it. We don\u2019t have to talk about that. I won\u2019t bring it up again. I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the truth is that he\u2019s not pressured. Yuuri had kissed him first, had wanted to, had <em>liked</em> it because it felt like the banquet night again, something quietly intimate and instantaneously close. He\u2019d indulged in the fantasy of Viktor wanting him, needing him.</p>\n<p>And he had, for tonight. On this little couch. Just like he had during the banquet.</p>\n<p>Now Viktor was saying he wouldn\u2019t bring it up again. Just like during the banquet. It\u2019s Yuuri\u2019s own fault, for being emotional and attached and obsessed with Viktor since childhood.</p>\n<p>He wants to stand, but Viktor\u2019s body is a pressure atop him on the cushions. At the shift in Yuuri\u2019s eyes, his shoulders, Viktor scrambles smoothly to a sitting position at one end of the couch. Watches and waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Yuuri says. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the strangest vulnerability that trickles over Viktor\u2019s expression. \u201cYou do?\u201d He questions softly.</p>\n<p>The younger skater nods, and stands, and goes to his room. When he shuffles out to use the bathroom in the hallway and brush his teeth, Viktor\u2019s standing at the end of it, rubbing at the poodle wound about his legs, but his eyes are up, focused. Like he\u2019d been waiting for Yuuri.</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019ve never met anyone like you.</em> That night. Waltzes and swaying and a slow swing dance, then something entirely their own, each step a newly created secret between them.</p>\n<p><em>I waited for you for so long. </em>A confession Yuuri had only dreamed of hearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Yuuri says. Viktor beams, pats at Makkachin one last time.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri expects them not to talk about it or acknowledge it, in the morning. They don\u2019t, for the first half-hour\u2014Viktor chewing at a banana and scrolling through his phone, elbow on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder while they sit at the kitchen counter stools and the Japanese man wakes up.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t acknowledge it when they drive in the ridiculous pink sports car. When they park in the rink lot.</p>\n<p>Then, Viktor swings Yuuri\u2019s equipment bag over his own shoulder from the backseat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to carry it,\u201d he announces, and leans forward to drop a kiss on Yuuri\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>!\u201d Comes a growl, and before Yuuri has much of a chance to register it Yuri Plisetsky is barreling in and shoving his own sports bag between them with all the ferocity a short fifteen year old can muster. \u201cI am <em>not</em> putting up with this at morning practice! And he\u2019s <em>my</em> coach, you stay\u2014\u201c he spreads one arm out gracefully as far as it can go \u201c\u2014you stay <em>this far away</em> at all times!\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles. \u201cOf course, Yurio.\u201d Pleasantly retreats a step, roughly the length of Yuri\u2019s arm. Unfortunately, Viktor towers over the blond by a good seven inches, and when he reaches out a hand it still easily comes to rest on the curve of Yuuri\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Yuri hisses, resignedly now. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Yakov thought this was a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Viktor asks, distracted. His thumb is stroking pensively at the bags beneath Yuuri\u2019s eyes, a subtle frown growing on his perfect lips. Yurio rolls his eyes, and mutters something in Russian that Yuuri can\u2019t catch before slinging his bag back onto his shoulder and stomping off, as gracefully as Yuuri has ever seen anyone manage. \u201cOh. Speaking of Yakov. Do you mind if I tell him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks. \u201cTell him what, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue, I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d phrase it, either. He didn\u2019t like it when I went out with one of the ice dancers from the rink, thought it would distract us.\u201d Viktor\u2019s smile is blindingly bright and utterly confusing. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be working harder now, to impress you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll approve of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri is still unsure what they\u2019re telling Yakov.</p>\n<p>He is unsure until, when he\u2019s again disgusting and gross and has Yakov\u2019s yelling ringing in his ears at the end of the day, Viktor comes over, links their hands, and waves to Yakov as they head out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t just walk away from me,\u201d Yakov booms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYakov,\u201d Viktor sighs. \u201cYakov, Yakov, Yakov. I know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor asserts. \u201cI even spent time making a pro and con list so I could convince you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are no drawbacks, Yakov! We don\u2019t drink together, weeelll not yet, and I\u2019ll teach him jumps and he\u2019ll teach me spins and we\u2019ll show off on the ice for each other!\u201c he pauses, squeezes at Yuuri\u2019s hand, as he absorbs Yakov\u2019s final words. \u201c\u2026We don\u2019t have to convince you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Vitya. <em>Finally</em>.\u201d He points at Yuuri, then, who swallows and wishes they were having this conversation in Russian, because then he\u2019d have an excuse to not understand a word of it. \u201cRemember the rink rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri thinks through them. No phones. Check. Phichit complains about how little he\u2019s on it. No alcohol. Check. He hasn\u2019t touched a bottle since Detroit.</p>\n<p>No sexual activity.</p>\n<p>He glances down at where their hands are interlinked. \u201cSir!\u201d He yelps, and yanks his hand out of Viktor\u2019s. The man visibly pouts, and Yuuri stares at him with wide, disbelieving eyes before Yakov trundles back into the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully now both of you can come out of your slumps and be the inspired but ridiculous skaters I know you to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Yuuri says, desperately. There\u2019s been some kind of mistake. The coach is acting like one night of kissing that Yakov doesn\u2019t even know about, <em>one night, again</em>, and a morning of hand holding has some kind of mysterious, special meaning. Yuuri knows it does not. He\u2019s not sure how long the affection will last, this time\u2014they\u2019re both sober, yes, but soon enough Viktor will lose interest again, and he doesn\u2019t want his new coach aware of something transient and embarrassing like this, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe,\u201d Viktor says, from beside him. \u201cBreathe, Yuuri, he approves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe Viktor just does things like this. Flirts with his rinkmates. Looks and speaks at someone for one night like they\u2019re his everything, like Yuuri is rain and sun and the feel of a perfect slide to a stop on the ice\u2014but only for one night.</p>\n<p>They go back to the car. Viktor turns up the radio, tilts his head with the piano and the dip of the singer\u2019s voice. \u201cThat went well, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>That evening, when Yuuri has snuck away and started playing his 3DS in his guest bedroom, eager for a distraction, Viktor raps on the door. He sweeps in, a small but intricately decorated box in one hand and a comb in the other. \u201cI need to occupy my hands.\u201d So Yuuri moves to the floor, after Viktor holds up one finger in brief thought and retrieves a couch pillow for him to sit on. The Russian settles onto the edge of the bed, starts combing through Yuuri\u2019s short hair, dreamily humming bits and pieces of song, like he\u2019s talking in his sleep. Yuuri is lulled\u2014closes his game, sighs, shifts back and decides to enjoy the affection while it lasts. \u201cYou gel it for competitions, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hmm.\u201d The feeling\u2019s nice, tingling, every sweep of the brush making him anticipate the next.</p>\n<p>\u201cJapanese nationals and Russian nationals are too close together,\u201d Viktor complains, a soft buzz above Yuuri\u2019s head, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to fix your hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s uncomfortable, the implication. Like a promise that Viktor is going to be around in months and months, going to be here and intimate like they\u2019ve been the past few days. Yuuri can\u2019t handle implied promises, not anymore. He tilts his head back, reaches up with one hand, and Viktor makes a noise so softly he almost doesn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I?\u201d He asks. Viktor leans down till his fringe is sleek in Yuuri\u2019s hand. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sure people ask all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor hums, shifts down further, till his forehead is on Yuuri\u2019s, and Yuuri pushes his hand up, past the crown of Viktor\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. Not since I cut it.\u201d There\u2019s a pause. \u201c\u2026And sponsors never <em>asked</em> to touch, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can\u2019t see his eyes. He wishes he could. Instead he scratches lightly beneath the other man\u2019s hair until he melts around Yuuri, pale arms about his neck and shoulders, lips to Yuuri\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stay that way for a few minutes more, just brief sighs and Viktor, relaxing, filling in every crevice on Yuuri\u2019s shoulders and back.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay with me tonight,\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice rumbles, low. It vibrates from his ear straight to his throat, his heart. Yuuri squeezes his eyes shut, flinching, and Viktor sits up, cards his hand through the dark hair one last time. \u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right. I just want to sleep next to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s traitorously tempting, like Viktor sleeping next to him will keep him there tomorrow morning and every morning after that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Yuuri says.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re in bed, Viktor rolls impossibly close, nudges his way beneath Yuuri\u2019s arm and wedges one leg between Yuuri\u2019s. When he\u2019s sure that Viktor is asleep, peacefully, without a care in the world, he presses his face into Viktor\u2019s hair and lets out one tear. One, another, and then his mind collapses into\u00a0twisting dark.</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries to ask Yurio about it, once.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor?\u201d Yuri scowls. \u201cViktor\u2019s always saying things he doesn\u2019t mean. Well, maybe he means them at the time, but he forgets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThings he doesn\u2019t mean,\u201d Yuuri chokes out, and Yuri launches into a spin, completely oblivious to the oncoming breakdown.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he huffs, \u201cthat idiot always forgets things. Or maybe he remembers, and just plays dumb to serve his own interests. It\u2019s hard to tell, with Viktor. He can\u2019t keep a promise for his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Yuuri says. He cannot see, actually, because there\u2019s tears welling up and the ice of the rink has melted into blurry white and dirty brown. \u201cI have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike hell you do,\u201d Yuri replies, all sharpness, but he follows Yuuri there, stands outside the closed stall door\u2014Yuuri imagines him, arms crossed and yanking impatiently at his own ponytail. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, idiot? We\u2019re not at a competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Putting the problem into words would be difficult enough, if he wasn\u2019t trying to explain a private situation to a furious fifteen year old.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, ah, nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t typically call Viktor Nikiforov <em>nothing</em>,\u201d Yuri snorts, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad that you do. What, did he make you a promise too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri opens the stall door, wipes roughly at his own eyes. \u201cSomething like that. At the banquet last year.\u201d He looks up, bites his lip. \u201cHas Viktor ever\u2026 said anything to you about the Sochi banquet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri scowls, but it\u2019s the weakest one of his Yuuri has ever seen. \u201cIt\u2019s an unofficial rule not to talk about the banquet with Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a burning sensation that rises in Yuuri\u2019s face. \u201cOhhhh, god. Us dancing was that embarrassing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHah? No.\u201d Yurio kicks at the bathroom tiles. \u201cYou didn\u2019t meet him before the banquet. You live with him so you\u2019ve probably seen bits of it. Viktor\u2019s a screw-up, sometimes.\u201d He kicks again. The words \u2018screw-up\u2019 and \u2018Viktor Nikiforov\u2019 have never once been close to each other in Yuuri\u2019s mind, except for when the screw-up was Yuuri himself. The dripping of water from a leaky sink permeates the whole bathroom, tears at Yuuri\u2019s ears. Yurio continues on. \u201cA screw-up in his\u2026 head. He only got twenty times worse after Sochi. Yakov thought\u2026 hmph, yeah. We\u2019ve all learned not to talk to him about the banquet or the GPF. Even Christophe Giacometti, who reveals everything from his fetishes to what\u2019s under his disgustingly tight skating outfits, got the hint to not talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fear Yuuri\u2019s felt is swept away, for a temporary moment. \u201cIs he okay? Should I be\u2026 doing something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri glares at him. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot better this season, yeah. I <em>don\u2019t</em> wanna hear the details about how you did that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Yuuri questions, too mild and unsure for it to even be a true question.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, gross, let\u2019s just get back to practice,\u201d Yuri says, \u201cI want to make my step sequence faster than yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri presses his palms into his eyes, takes a deep and watery breath. \u201cWon\u2019t happen till you stop favoring your right side and keeping yourself unbalanced. I know you can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut <em>up</em>,\u201d Yuri growls. His step sequence improves significantly. Yuuri\u2019s got the quad salchow consistently in practice, now.</p>\n<p>He has the rinks late at night for himself, too, after a long and uncomfortable discussion with Yakov. He takes the bus after dinner sometimes, so he doesn\u2019t bother Viktor for a ride, and skates until the buzzing nerves seep from his muscles. Figures, <em>On Love: Eros.</em> The piece he hasn\u2019t named yet, the piece Yakov is making him produce. He thinks of dinners with Viktor, and soft kisses, and never dares to hope.</p>\n<p>At night, no one can see him practice his new jump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days after their talk with Yakov, Mila Babicheva returns from training camp in America, where she\u2019s been since early on in the summer. She sees Yuuri and Viktor curled up, eating bentos the Japanese man had made in a corner for lunch, and slides over to them with a knowing smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it finally happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yuuri questions warily, worry starting to thrum at his chest. He hates this vagueness that\u2019s settled like a haze over so many of his interactions in the past few days.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d she gestures with a hand. Her nails are painted electric blue, and Yuuri stares at them as they dart through the air, dragonflies.</p>\n<p>\u201cDating,\u201d Viktor pipes up. Yuuri drops his chopsticks. One rolls under the bench they\u2019re sitting on. Viktor laughs, nudges at his hand that\u2019s fisted around the one chopstick he managed to save. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you eat, like this. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still be better than me even with only one chopstick.\u201d Yuuri hopes that singular chopstick isn\u2019t shaking, isn\u2019t completely obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, after the GPF, I suppose it was only a matter of time.\u201d Her eyes settle softly on Yuuri. \u201cI was so happy to hear that Yakov had offered you a spot at our rink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the GPF?\u201d Viktor echoes, bright and curious. \u201cAh, well, of course after Yakov saw Yuuri skate, even in a routine that wasn\u2019t his best, he couldn\u2019t resist!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Someone</em> couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d she replies slyly. \u201cMaybe two someones, even?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDating,\u201d Yuuri states stiffly. It\u2019s a mere echo of Viktor\u2019s statement from earlier\u2014it\u2019s taking so long for Yuuri to catch up, to accept that he hadn\u2019t imagined the word.</p>\n<p>Mila giggles, pats him on the shoulder. \u201cOf course it\u2019s mutual, if you\u2019re dating. Then I won\u2019t interrupt your romantic lunch. Stay safe!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can\u2019t stay <em>safe</em>. He\u2019s having a heart attack. Mila sways off, throwing one last cheeky smile over her shoulder, and when she\u2019s gone Yuuri takes a deep breath and shoves his bento to the bench.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re <em>dating</em>?\u201d He hisses. Viktor has the good grace to look jarred. His perfect lips fall open, maybe even tremble a little, and his pale fingers clutch at his bento box. It\u2019s heartbreaking, and completely unfair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, just, for so long I\u2019d\u2014we kept going out on dates in the evenings and after our conversation with Yakov, I\u2014\u201c The Russian swallows, shakes his head. \u201cI always get ahead of myself, I\u2019m sorry. What do you want to call it?\u201d Yuuri just stares at him, trying to work it out. Viktor gives a strange smile, makes eye contact. \u201cYou want to keep your options open? Date other people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Viktor lets out on a quick breath. \u201cThen we can label it anything you want, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri grips lightly at his knees, stares determinedly out towards the rink. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point,\u201d he replies, trying so hard to not let his voice break, \u201cI know it\u2019s not going to last. You don\u2019t have to pretend like it will.\u201d <em>Don\u2019t do it for my sake. It\u2019ll only make it worse when you leave again.</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a perfect silence, something Yuuri is unused to. Viktor can be quiet, can sit in the living room with Yuuri and not talk for hours, just settled sweetly with a book or his phone, but the Russian man likes to tap with his fingertips, likes to communicate with smiling sighs anytime he finishes a chapter. Recently he\u2019s taken to tracing patterns on Yuuri\u2019s skin, dragging the Japanese skater\u2019s legs over him like a blanket when they sit on the couch. Yuuri wants that now, wants it fiercely. But he wants so much, in this world, and his desires are too sharp and strong to keep in his heart. They just make him bleed out.</p>\n<p>The silence doesn\u2019t end, just stretches out thin and terrible, and Yuuri can\u2019t bear to look up from where his knuckles are clutching white against his pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Yakov bursts in with a growl, rounding the corner. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on lunch break for almost forty-five minutes. I agreed to dating, Vitya, I didn\u2019t agree to elopement from the ice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beside him, Viktor stands. \u201cYakov, you know me! I jumped straight to the elopement. We\u2019ll come back now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, when they\u2019ve hung up their coats and are standing in the entryway of their home, Viktor stares down at him and says,</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 a temporary situation. That\u2019s what you want.\u201d Then, quieter, \u201cI can give you what you want, Yuuri. I\u2019m good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries not to shake. Maybe this is what Viktor finds fun. Be someone\u2019s dream, for a night or a few days, make promises of <em>forever </em>and <em>I\u2019ve been waiting for you</em> like the romance is real.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to mold yourself into something for me. Just be Viktor.\u201d Because no matter how ridiculous the promises Viktor makes, no matter how he doesn\u2019t mean most of them, there are other parts of the champion that Yuuri knows has to be real, human. Delighted aggression in winning at cards, the way he cuddles with Makkachin, combing Yuuri\u2019s hair, beautiful things. Things that are even more attractive than promises. Things that Yuuri has been gifted, however temporarily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cEven when you\u2019re cruel,\u201d Viktor says, \u201ceven when you\u2019re cruel you\u2019re good to me, Yuuri. This isn't the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Japanese skater goes numbly to his room, and wonders, in that spiraling agony of the anxious, why Viktor calls self-preservation <em>cruelty</em>.</p>\n<p>When Yuuri was twelve, he looked at Viktor Nikiforov and thought, <em>I want to be special enough for you to notice me.</em></p>\n<p>When Yuuri was twenty-three, Viktor had. But Yuuri\u2019s worth had been in champagne bubbles and spinning, delicate moves on the dance floor: temporary, balanced things, bound to die.</p>\n<p>Yuuri has always known he was nothing special, but it hurts to hope.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri manages to wake up first, which hasn\u2019t happened before in his time living with Viktor. When he shuffles into the kitchen through the darkness of Viktor\u2019s apartment, there\u2019s a wrecked calm to it\u2014the aftermath of a storm. Viktor\u2019s coat and scarf are curiously pooled on the floor, rather than on the coat rack, and Yuuri hangs them up, brushes the expensive fabric off. Time is limited. So Yuuri snags fruit from the counter and does the simple preparation for Viktor\u2019s favorite cereal, and takes it to his door.</p>\n<p>Three knocks, and nothing. Yuuri realizes, swallowing the lump in his throat, that Viktor could have already left for practice. He\u2019ll have to Google the bus schedule, but he\u2019ll definitely be late at this point\u2014</p>\n<p>The door pops open, just enough for a tousled silver head to poke through, bare shoulders following it. Yuuri looks to the door hinges and focuses on his breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late, so I just wanted to\u2026\u201d At first, Yuuri thinks the resulting chuckle and incomprehensible mumble is rough and drawn out with sleep. Then he realizes it\u2019s <em>slurred</em>. Suddenly the strange smell clinging to Viktor\u2019s coat earlier clicks in Yuuri\u2019s mind. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d He asks, stunned.</p>\n<p>Viktor presses his forehead to the doorframe.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably? Yes. Which is good. Better than a hangover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014we have\u2014practice in half an hour,\u201d Yuuri blurts. \u201cWhy are you <em>drunk</em>? It\u2019s a Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRussian tradition,\u201d Viktor assures him, seriously. He ruins the moment for himself when his arm slips on the doorframe, knocking his head into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in no condition to drive\u2014you\u2019re in no condition to skate! I\u2019ll call Yakov\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNooo,\u201d Viktor moans, \u201cno, he worries. And yells. Very loud, so don\u2019t do that, we\u2019ll regret it. I\u2019d rather skate like this. I hold my liquor well. I was just out till\u2026\u201d He squints. \u201cFive am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>five-thirty</em>.\u201d Yuuri stares at the other man, who\u2019s rubbing at his red forehead and swaying slightly. \u201cViktor,\u201d he says, gently, \u201clet me come in. We\u2019ll get you water.\u201d Viktor opens the door fully. \u201cAh! Please put on clothes first.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Yuuri comes back with cool water and a washcloth, Viktor has on sweats and is cross-legged on his bed, staring at him. Yuuri holds out the water, and Viktor\u2019s alcohol-loosened hands run over his forearm and wrist, electric to Yuuri even in this state, before managing to take the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you spill any alcohol on you?\u201d He gestures with the wash cloth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you in a shower by yourself, that could be dangerous. Just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor isn\u2019t listening, and it\u2019s clear from his wide-eyed, clear gaze, even if he looks nearly sober, except for the flush. If Yuuri wasn\u2019t sober himself, it\u2019d be near impossible to tell. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he says, and Yuuri drops the washcloth with a sickening <em>slap</em> onto the wooden floor. \u201cSo good. And mine, for a little while.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Always yours</em>, Yuuri wants to correct. <em>Always. Even when you leave.</em></p>\n<p>Viktor is still going, rolling his expensive sheets back and forth between his hands. \u201cI could stay in bed today. You could stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in a right state of mind, Viktor,\u201d Yuuri says, softly. The Russian looks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had thought being close to Viktor was difficult. Kissing him had been a devastating and essential thing, water he drank and drowned in. Viktor like this is somehow worse\u2014all sweetness and fumbling, staring up plaintively through silver lashes and saying pretty things, things that make Yuuri want to scream and do quadruple jumps until his knees shatter, like <em>beautiful</em> and <em>mine</em>. Like the banquet all over again, except this time the champion can\u2019t disappear in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it matters.\u201d Viktor matters, more than anything.</p>\n<p>The Russian sighs, a wispy thing. \u201cPick up the washcloth, Yuuri?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri does, leans over quickly and plucks it up. \u201cSorry. I won\u2019t leave it on your wooden floor\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Viktor reaches out, takes his hand and the cloth, brings it to his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says plainly. Yuuri can feel the heated flush of his skin, red with alcohol, through the damp fabric between them. He rubs up and down, soft, and Viktor wobbles with the motion, eyes locked onto Yuuri\u2019s own. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult, caring for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caring for him, because Yuuri will always care and Viktor never can?</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, he realizes dimly, running the washcloth slowly and gently down the slope of Viktor\u2019s perfect neck, <em>he just means caring for him when he\u2019s drunk</em>.</p>\n<p>The old interpretation is still just as true.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Yuuri says, and Viktor shivers beneath his hand. Leans into his touch. Yuuri brushes lower on his torso, meticulous and determined, before settling him back into bed with a plastic bag and a pitcher of water by his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Yakov I\u2019m sick,\u201d Viktor slurs. \u201cThat I\u2019m <em>dying</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries. Yakov narrows his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re even worse at lying than he is. That selfish man is hungover, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri blurts in a panic. The coach snorts, disbelieving. \u201c\u2026He\u2019s still drunk.\u201d Yurio <em>cackles</em>. Yakov\u2019s hair is falling out before Yuuri\u2019s very eyes.</p>\n<p>Somehow, his honesty doesn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>When he comes home, Viktor is doing crunches on a yoga mat on the floor. He doesn\u2019t make eye contact\u2014Yuuri assumes he doesn\u2019t want to talk about getting drunk, about missing practice, about\u2026 whatever happened last night. Still, he gathers up water from the kitchen and Tylenol from the cabinet, and goes to kneel next to the Russian.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d Viktor settles back, lays sprawled perfectly on the floor, knees propped up loosely. Yuuri tries not to think too hard about it. Nudges him with the glass of water. Caring for Viktor\u2014that\u2019s easy, like living out the half of his fantasies with Viktor that don\u2019t involve a bed, like they\u2019re married and there\u2019s a domesticity to it, a drowsy affection. If they were married, they\u2019d take sick days off together from the rink, and Makkachin would lay across the top of the two of them while they shivered under the covers in Viktor\u2019s room, warm soup and twenty boxes of tissues stacked on their bedside table. If they were married, they would dance every day, tango and foxtrot and sliding socks on the kitchen floor, screams of laughter\u2014he knows exactly how Viktor\u2019s laughs sound, now. The real ones.</p>\n<p>Maybe Viktor calls self-preservation <em>cruelty</em> because it\u2019s only prolonging the inevitable. Yuuri\u2019s going to love him regardless of whether Viktor wants twenty minutes or twenty years. Maybe it\u2019s better to accept their relationship as it is. Lips and nipping teeth and holding hands and no promises, not anymore.</p>\n<p>He leans forward, settles the glass of water in Viktor\u2019s hand, his lips on Viktor\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou worried me,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cAnd Yakov. I don\u2019t mind caring for you, it\u2019s not difficult, but\u2026 are you going to do this again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor blinks. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Turns his head, follows Yuuri\u2019s mouth as the Japanese man leans back, kisses it twice. \u201cProbably,\u201d he confesses, low. A vibration against Yuuri\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre we going to keep doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This</em>, kissing and closeness, is like some kind of dark, swirling dream.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Are we going to keep doing this?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuri can\u2019t bear to tell him no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Yuuri had called Viktor \u2018affectionate\u2019 at the banquet, he\u2019s not sure what word captures the level of physical intimacy now. He touches Viktor on the arm in the kitchen in the morning, just a touch because Yuuri is sleepy and lazy and Viktor\u2019s blocking his kettle of boiling water. Somehow, that results in the taller skater being wrapped around him while he sips blearily at his tea, standing between the kitchen island and the stove. When he pats at Viktor\u2019s wrist with one hand, he buries in tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want your coffee?\u201d Yuuri asks, gravelly, when their expensive French coffeemaker blinks green.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Viktor says, and doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am actually throwing up,\u201d growls Yuri Plisetsky at practice. \u201cRight in my mouth. This is disgusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not throwing up,\u201d Yuuri disagrees politely, \u201cyou\u2019re throwing your phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <em>mean the same thing</em>,\u201d Yuri snaps. \u201cWhy is he clinging onto you and mooning over you like you\u2019re both about to tragically die?\u201d He pauses, then adds sharply under his breath, \u201cnot like I\u2019d complain about him doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this not normal?\u201d Mila asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith Viktor there IS no normal,\u201d Yuri declares.</p>\n<p>The silver-haired man glides by where they\u2019re standing rinkside, blows a kiss to Yuri (who shrieks) and winks at Yuuri. \u201cHi, Mila!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seems fine to me,\u201d Mila says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Minako comes to the Kyushu championships, squeezes his shoulders while Yuuri tries to control his breathing. Yakov had offered to attend, but Yuuri felt wrong taking him from the other skaters and making him fly hundreds of miles for something that was meant to be small, a regional competition. Something Yuuri shouldn\u2019t have even needed to participate in, except he\u2019d crashed and burned and landed himself here in a charred heap. Yuuri\u2019s phone buzzes. Without much thought, Yuuri opens it while Minako still stands over him.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viktor</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yuuri! You\u2019re guaranteed the win! I\u2019m thinking of you. &lt;3 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Also, did you know that the President of your fanclub has been posting all kinds of pictures on Twitter? From where they\u2019re angled he has to be another skater, I think! You should say hello ;)</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuri types a reply, if just to occupy his trembling fingers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am not guaranteed a win. I lost to one of the competitors last Nationals. We talked about this.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I don\u2019t think I have a fanclub?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIs \u2018Viktor\u2019 the same thing as \u2018Viktor <em>Nikiforov</em>\u2019?\u201d Minako questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri responds abruptly. His phone buzzes again. It\u2019s a selfie of Viktor with Makkachin.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viktor</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We did talk about it. When you get home, we\u2019ll celebrate! I want to take you out on a date.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seductive little <em>sneak</em>,\u201d Minako says, voice beginning to rise at the end, and Yuuri cuts her off with a,</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Minako, please, I\u2019m skating soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she concedes, settling.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viktor</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I think your fanclub president has blonde hair with a streak of red.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks up, scans the area around him, extremely doubtful. Coach, crying fifteen year old skater, aggravated coach, blonde child with Yuuri\u2019s old skating outfit and a flashing cell phone\u2014<em>oh god</em>.</p>\n<p>At the Kyushu regionals, Yuuri takes home a gold and, with the insistence of Minako and Viktor tag-teaming him, has interacted\u2026 <em>positively</em>\u2026 with Kenjirou Minami.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor takes him out, as promised. Sushi. It\u2019s expensive and intimate and Viktor spends half of it with his chin propped in his hand, his shoeless foot brushing at Yuuri\u2019s calf. Afterwards, Viktor tries to call them a cab, but Yuuri gets him to walk for a time along the river. In the rushing sounds and dark they hold hands, stumble together over the cobbled sidewalks. When Viktor sets Yuuri onto his own bed, and kisses down his neck, he murmurs wetly, \u201cmissed you.\u201d It\u2019s been five days.</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d <em>For months, and months, and months</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Why didn\u2019t you want me then, if you promised those things? Why would you want me now?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries not to cry. It works, at least until Viktor\u2019s sleeping, shirtless and curled up against him. He\u2019d wanted Viktor to say that when he first arrived. Now isn\u2019t the time to dwell on these things. Now he has Viktor with him, and he has to take advantage of limited time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Yuuri says, after Yurio has become frustrated with spins after an hour and has gone to cool off in the weight room, \u201cI wanted to ask about\u2026\u201d he swallows, looks down.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor?\u201d Yakov questions seriously, and Yuuri blinks up at him, the words prompting his own reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe trial period.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Your</em> trial period?\u201d Yakov confirms, and then snorts. \u201cWere you still thinking about that, Katsuki? That\u2019s over and done\u2014you\u2019re going to the Cup of China. You are my skater, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d he whispers, ducking his head. Slotting into Russia in some permanent way, something that\u2019s firm and reassuring, has tears building up in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow often are you going to do this to me,\u201d Yakov blusters. Still, he goes to his coaching bag and comes back with a blanket and a bottle of water. \u201cI deal with crying children, but I don\u2019t know how to handle you. I am not a soft man, Katsuki.\u201d Yuuri, drowsily wrapped up in fleece, is starting to wonder about that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is it okay if I come over next rest day to do that pirozhki/katsudon exchange we promised to do? Would your grandfather mind?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We talked about that 2 months ago you asshole</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bother your family</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We\u2019re at the store buying the ingredients so you better come</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Bring the idiot</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, my mistake, we talked about calling him nicer things since he read our texts and sulked and\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Played nothing but Beyonc\u00e9 and sad Russian pop ballads for two weeks on our drive to the rink? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I meant: the Drama Queen</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Also, tell him to stop creeping on your texts.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He\u2019s\u2026 reading this over my shoulder. Sorry.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dgsdfsdkkkk</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Katsudon, what are you doing</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>He tickled me. It\u2019s okay, I escaped the couch and replaced him with Makkachin and my bed</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Neither of you are ever allowed within ten feet of me</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We\u2019ll be over on Wednesday?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>At 6pm. Do not make my grandpa wait on you</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor and Yuuri\u2019s day starts early, in the only international market that sells the appropriate ingredients. Viktor is wandering curiously through the fish selection, but Yuuri pulls him wordlessly away, keeps him by his sleeve, and tries to balance his basket and his phone with the ingredient list in his other hand. Viktor takes the basket, swings it, smiles at him. Distractedly, he fiddles with a box of pocky on a nearby shelf. By now, Yuuri knows that his roommate is impossible to shop with\u2014he grabs already ripe bananas and never checks the vegetables for mold, just buys extra and throws bad food out or feeds the best scraps to Makkachin. He\u2019s ridiculous. He can be wasteful. Yuuri wants to shop with him for the rest of his life, and do laundry while Viktor wanders the house in a bathrobe, and clean their apartment to the sound of figure skating podcasts. He wants the last few months to be years.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Viktor questions about one fruit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014ah,\u201d he muses, and the word for it in Japanese rolls from his tongue, but no English word appears. \u201cHmm. They\u2019re sour? But now\u2019s a bad time of year\u2014they\u2019re best in the summer, we\u2019d have to try it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Viktor says, and shuffles up against his side. \u201cI\u2019d like to come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Yuuri tells him. The international store is fifteen minutes from their apartment, by car. Viktor presses closer, and Yuuri steps back, against boxes of colorful, bumpy fruits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to pick,\u201d the Russian says, switches the shopping basket between his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d help you,\u201d Yuuri says, baffled. \u201cYou just have to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s smile is usually immediate, beaming, but this one comes slow and sweet, syrupy, closed lips and soft eyes. The fruit is sour. Viktor\u2019s expression is bittersweet.</p>\n<p>It occurs to Yuuri that Viktor might think that, once their intimacy dissolves, these little things will go with it. When Viktor wanders off to the rest of the store again, Yuuri doesn\u2019t stop him. He thinks of fantasies of dancing in socks in the kitchen, of Viktor never learning how to pick out good vegetables from bad when they shop together at the supermarket, of lazy days when they\u2019d peek through the shutters out at grim rain or snow and Viktor would drag him back, giggling, through the house and under warm covers.</p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t leave, no, no</em>, Viktor had whispered. Celestino had texted, his words on the phone painfully bright in the dark blur of the ballroom, a sign of the end. <em>Stay with me, Yuuri, please, never leave.</em></p>\n<p>Yuuri leans over the fruits. Clutches at his tightening chest, spreading between his shoulders and threatening to split open, slows his breathing. He does not cry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They manage to make it to Yurio\u2019s house by 6pm, arms laden with paper bags of purchases and freshly made ingredients. It\u2019s cramped\u2014nothing like Viktor\u2019s apartment\u2014but this keeps it close, and lets the sizzling sound of oil in a pan fill the whole of the house. Nikolai is exactly like Yurio, except far more honest and relaxed. He assures them it will only be a few minutes, and then Yuuri can use the small kitchen to start making his katsudon.</p>\n<p>\u201cBring us your cat! Call for her!\u201d Viktor commands cheerfully, and Yurio throws a couch pillow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cat, idiot, you go to him!\u201d This involves a trip into Yurio\u2019s room, which is surprisingly bare on the walls except for a few band posters that Yuuri doesn\u2019t recognize but assumes are heavy metal, from the hooded skulls and gunmetal-grey backgrounds, the occasional splatter of red flame.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotya,\u201d Yurio <em>coos</em>, a sound which Yuuri has to spend a few seconds digesting, and the fluffy cat rolls from his back and trots to Yurio across the bed. Up he goes, into Yurio\u2019s arms, and he turns to Yuuri with heavy expectation in his eyes. \u201cDo you want to pet him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t know if he has much of a choice. \u201cOf course.\u201d Yuuri scratches behind his ears, smooths down his back\u2014his college acquaintance Ketty had a cat, one that sat atop her keyboard in her dorm room, and Potya seems similar. Viktor reaches out, ruffles at the top of Potya's head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a dog!\u201d Yurio barks. Potya seems undisturbed by the yelling. \u201cYou don\u2019t just rub at him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you never met Potya before?\u201d Yuuri questions, and Viktor shrugs. It\u2019s confusing\u2014he\u2019d assumed that Viktor had been here, considering that Yurio occasionally shows up at their apartment in return, seems to have his own set of keys. All he does once he\u2019s there is eat their carrots and use the video game console Viktor has but Yuuri\u2019s never seen him touch, but he shows up consistently. Less, after he walked in one day to Viktor\u2019s hands up Yuuri\u2019s shirt when they were on the couch, but consistently.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Viktor says plainly. \u201cYurio\u2019s never invited me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never mentioned it,\u201d Yurio replies, lip curling up sourly. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you wanted to come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a chill breeze, in Yurio\u2019s room. It\u2019s coming from his windowsill, like it\u2019s never been insulated properly. The home is well cared for, but the paint is cracked, the carpet well-worn, and Yurio\u2019s bedroom is the size of Viktor\u2019s walk-in closet. Yurio has new tiger print clothes, but they\u2019re all cheap\u2014and that\u2019s from Yuuri\u2019s view, who has no sense of these things. Viktor knows how to charm a hundred people all at once, to symbolize seduction and desire and riches with a flick of his hand on the ice, how to inspire other skaters, how to treat a fan with kindness and respect and sign a signature, then move on. But this, this. He has no training to form a relationship with one poor fifteen year old that\u2019s probably looked up to him, been surrounded by The Extravagant Hero of Russia, for years. Strangers, even friends sometimes, leave Yuuri floundering\u2014but the intuitive, gentle touch of <em>family</em>\u2026 that, Yuuri can handle.</p>\n<p>Yurio\u2019s still glaring at them, clutching at a now wriggling Potya. His face is dusted with stubborn red. The silence has been too long.</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio,\u201d says Yuuri. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking forward to this all day. Thank you for letting us meet Potya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the younger skater half snarls, but he props her up higher on his hip, aggravation calming to suspicion.</p>\n<p>Yuuri laces his fingers with Viktor\u2019s, who looks over to him with lowered eyes, and brings their entwined hands up to Potya. The cat sniffs at them with a wet nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor loves pirozhki,\u201d Yuuri continues, \u201cwith beef and mushroom especially, I think? From that little stall on the street corner we go to on Saturdays.\u201d</p>\n<p>The champion hums a noise of assent, and Yuuri thumbs lightly at the back of his hand where they\u2019re still intertwined, dropping them loosely now between their sides. There\u2019s a small sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrandpa\u2019s is <em>better</em>,\u201d Yurio asserts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come here instead, then,\u201d Viktor says easily. \u201cOn Saturdays.\u201d Yurio\u2019s jaw works itself, lips tightening.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust invite yourself over to my house,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the Cup of China, and Viktor has come to support him. This makes Yakov scowl, and he snaps, \u201cdon\u2019t distract Yuuri, Vitya, he has better things to do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter things to do than me?\u201d Viktor asks, and it is only Yakov\u2019s old ears and the screaming of the crowds that saves both their lives.</p>\n<p>The support is\u2014strange. Yuuri\u2019s never wanted another person beside him so much, but it\u2019s <em>Viktor</em>. The Russian comments on skating with him, congratulates him on his short program, wraps around him while they watch the competitors like a sort of insulating blanket.</p>\n<p>Phichit, of course, finds them approximately two seconds after Viktor\u2019s started hugging him from behind and whispering in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Phichit,\u201d Yuuri squeaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d he sighs, \u201cjust because we\u2019re best friends, and I know you, I\u2019ll pretend this isn\u2019t happening for another five seconds. After that I\u2019m going to start taking pictures and uploading them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite Yuuri\u2019s most valiant efforts to peel the Russian off him, Phichit gets pictures.</p>\n<p>Later, when they\u2019re out at hotpot, Yuuri drags Phichit to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, um, don\u2019t seem surprised?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Phichit asks, \u201cWhy would I be surprised?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Viktor and I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit giggles, squeezes Yuuri\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh, my poor best friend. Living in the last century. You do realize Viktor\u2019s Instagram is basically a shrine to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Yuuri says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if I was joking, I could not be as hilarious as the real life situation of Viktor fawning over you. There\u2019s videos of you dancing doing laundry, videos of you at practice, you and Makkachin wrestling. Do you know that you left a plate out the other day and Viktor snapped a pic of the way you\u2019d arranged your leftover peas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019d made a little heart. Viktor thought it was cute. Anyway, Instagram actually took away his verified status cause they thought he\u2019d been hacked by one of your fans, but he contacted them and got it reestablished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a knocking at the door, a velvety voice that passes through it. \u201cYuuuuri. Is something scandalous going on in there? Our coaches are about to start taking shots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be done in a minute!\u201d Phichit yells. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna finish making out with Yuuri! Roommate benefits!\u201d Phichit gives him a quick hug. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. I knew Viktor would come around, after what you told me about the Sochi banquet. Well, okay, initially I thought he was an asshole celebrity who screwed with your head to, uh, not get in your pants? Unsure. I thought he was just sadistic. But now it\u2019s pretty clear that he actually likes you! So that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 good,\u201d Yuuri murmurs quietly. Phichit peers at him, far too aware.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Yuuri,\u201d he says, quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink this, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe likes me,\u201d Yuuri says, voice wobbling only a bit, \u201cfor <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phichit slings an arm around Yuuri, presses him in close. \u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee people will love us forever. Except for me,\u201d he adds fiercely, \u201cI\u2019ll always love you and you\u2019ll always love me or I\u2019ll be forced to take us both down in a blaze of glory.\u201d Yuuri laughs, settles his head on Phichit\u2019s shoulder. \u201cViktor may not always love you. Are you going to let that stop you from having this and being happy now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri whispers. He\u2019ll take anything he can have. The performance has begun, and he\u2019ll draw it out as long as he can.</p>\n<p>When they return to hotpot, Yakov is staring off into the distance, expression deathly serious and cheeks suspiciously pink, while Celestino has begun to foam on the tabletop. Viktor looks like\u2026 Viktor. But significantly less clothed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri!\u201d He gasps. \u201cYuuri, you came back!\u201d Yuuri settles beside him in the booth, and Viktor slings over him, presses two fingers to Yuuri\u2019s lips and when he reels back, startled, lifts up his chin and peers at his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor, what\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo bites, no hickies,\u201d Viktor says, satisfied. Yakov rumbles in the booth beside them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you <em>believe</em> us?\u201d Phichit asks, and dissolves into laughter. \u201cI never thought there\u2019d be a day when Viktor Nikiforov, world champion, was jealous of Phichit Chulanont. Before I even brought home a gold medal to Thailand, too. I am just becoming more amazing every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Viktor cries. It is also not funny when the Russian\u2019s clothing all ends up tossed from the booth and right onto poor, sweet Leo de la Iglesia\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What\u2019s even less amusing is what Viktor says when he drags Yuuri off to the garage, before the free skate. Yakov had watched them go, eyes a warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting him out of here is a surprisingly good idea, Vitya. Don\u2019t stress him unnecessarily.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the Russian champion had clearly not listened.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you miss the podium,\u201d Viktor says, \u201cI won\u2019t come to your competitions, again. I won\u2019t pressure you, or take up your time with date nights, I\u2019ll leave you\u2014\u201c The tears come at that, bursting forth with shuddering heat, and Viktor stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you say that,\u201d he says, \u201clike you\u2019re testing me. Like if I don\u2019t skate well, I\u2019ll lose you, and now you\u2019re just <em>mocking</em> me!\u201d He hadn\u2019t skated well at the Sochi GPF, and at first, that hadn\u2019t mattered, in a boozy night of fun. Now, Viktor\u2019s drawn it out longer, upped the stakes, slept beside him and kissed him and made more promises. His fists shake, clenched at his sides. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that you were wanting to stop doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor is backpedaling, waving hands, looking less and less like the man the reporters could never shake. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t <em>want</em> us to stop doing those things, Yuuri, but I don\u2019t want you to resent me and if you think they\u2019re bothering you\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re <em>not</em>!\u201d Yuuri insists hotly. \u201cThe nerves I feel right now, they\u2019re not always about you! But\u2014but here you are, supporting me and k-kissing my hand on live television, and people think I\u2019m your boyfriend, and now suddenly everything I do is related to you, reflects on you! If I fall, if you are anything less than perfect in your qualifiers, they\u2019ll blame us both!\u201d</p>\n<p>Time seems to stop. The Russian is thinking, a terrifying and calculating thing, eyes flashing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t make any of that go away,\u201d Viktor says lowly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t care what they think. I just need to know how to make <em>you</em> feel better. Should I just kiss you or something?\u201d The words electrify his heart into beating again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d Yuuri bursts, and here they are. Months of yearning, months of fearing, months of lying awake watching Viktor shift in his sleep and wondering if he\u2019d get to do it again the next night. He doesn\u2019t want Viktor\u2019s kisses or Viktor\u2019s promises or the physical intimacy that was preciously devastating. \u201cI just need you to believe in me, more than I do! I need you to stay close to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>The garage echoes with their argument. Yuuri feels as though he\u2019s the sound, slammed and thrown between concrete walls. Breath. Another.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay close to you,\u201d Viktor says, softly. \u201cAnd I already believe in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re just words, always words, but his eyes, the lean of his frame, they make it seem true. Yuuri takes in a deep breath. He\u2019s tired of sitting still every day, of waiting and doubt. If he can\u2019t trust in Viktor\u2019s interest in him, he should be trying harder. He can be alluring, appealing, can send a message and urge the other man to stay as best he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back upstairs,\u201d Yuuri murmurs, and takes his hand.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, Katsuki Yuuri lands a quadruple flip, and Viktor Nikiforov kisses him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Viktor would have joined him in the kiss and cry, but one look at the dead expression on Yakov\u2019s face had Viktor pecking Yuuri on the cheek and waving fondly before disappearing off into the screaming press mob. Yakov yells throughout the entire process, something about <em>rink rules apply to OTHER RINKS TOO, KATSUKI</em> and <em>a clean Salchow could\u2019ve earned you more</em> and finally <em>can you not control Vitya, Yuuri, though I know HE IS A HANDFUL, I thought you could be a good influence but I should have known it\u2019d take a while for you to rub off!</em> The scores come in. Yuuri hugs him, very briefly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, coach.\u201d</p>\n<p>The yelling does not resume.<em>\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time is limited before the Rostelecom Cup. They\u2019re both in it, along with Yuri Plisetsky, and Yakov somehow makes practice sessions more grueling. Yuuri\u2019s never been coached like this, with talent like this beside him\u2014it\u2019s an oddly relieving pressure, to know that he will probably never live up and yet to still try.</p>\n<p>They walk Makkachin together, and usually collapse exhausted at the end of the day onto the couch or Viktor\u2019s massive, plush mattress. Yurio moves in with Madame Baranovskaya, so Pirozhki Saturdays are put on hold. The days blur into each other in a satisfied but quiet haze.</p>\n<p>There are things about Viktor that never change\u2014he likes to hold and be held, to fall asleep wrapped up in one another, to read the newspaper on his tablet in the morning while Yuuri holds a fruit smoothie or a granola bar to his lips. In practice he is indomitable, indestructible. In the pink convertible he is bold, rubbing fondly at Yuuri\u2019s knee and over his inner thigh while they sit at traffic lights. Then, they have a rest day.</p>\n<p>Things slip out at the worst time: when he and Viktor are in bed. The words slip out because Viktor is right there in front of him, all Yuuri\u2019s in this moment and so close, and also because Yuuri is <em>close</em>\u2014he can feel the blinding spark shiver its way from his lower body up to his brain, and then he\u2019s pleading <em>\u201cI love you, I love you</em>\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Thank god, he thinks in the all-encompassing glow of it, that he had spoken in Japanese. For once, the language barrier between them has been helpful. As he comes down, so gently, he pleads the words again, safe in hiding.</p>\n<p>But Viktor\u2019s still beneath him, blue eyes overcome by desiring black, and as he follows Yuuri he gasps, \u201c<em>I love you too</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s in Russian. Yuuri has lived in Russia for the last several months. The words are unmistakable, and terrifying.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I think I love you. I know we\u2019re drunk and hardly know each other, but listen, believe me\u2014 I do, I do, I do. Believe me, Yuuri, you\u2019re so\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou speak,\u201d he breathes heavily, bringing a trembling hand up to his brow in shock, \u201cyou speak Japanese?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor presses his head back lightly in the pillow, eyes not leaving Yuuri\u2019s own. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to talk about, after we\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri chokes out, because the alternative could be listening to Viktor tell him he loves him, again, which is all Yuuri has ever wanted to hear. It\u2019s everything he\u2019s wanted, and it can\u2019t be handed to him and then taken away, not again. Being merged like this, that\u2019s something Yuuri can handle, a memory he will probably relive until the day he dies\u2014it can be a promise or commitment, but mostly is just pure feeling.</p>\n<p>\n<em>You, on that dance floor, smiling at me while you spun. You\u2019re everything, Yuuri. I can\u2019t believe I found you\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s pale skin never hides the flush of activity, except perhaps in the cold of the rink. Yet the pink sinks into deep red, now, as he answers. \u201cI don\u2019t speak Japanese.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you knew what I said,\u201d Yuuri whispers, \u201cyou <em>knew</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>They separate, everything cooling and their connection dissipating out of the air. Yuuri pulls the sheet about him, morbidly conscious of himself. The champion smiles, a thing full of dying hope. \u201cThat\u2019s the only sentence I know,\u201d Viktor admits, slow. \u201cThe only one I\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri squeezes his eyes shut, and wants to believe.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it first,\u201d he replies, very quietly, \u201cyou said it first, so can I assume\u2026 can I ask if you\u2019ve changed your mind? If I\u2019ve\u2026 changed your mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChanged my mind,\u201d Yuuri repeats, \u201cabout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor is so naked before him\u2014body, expression, clear blue eyes. He swallows, moves closer by an inch over the sheets. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t think this would last. Do you think now that you could\u2014 could see your feelings for me, lasting? Not being temporary?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor is cruel, sometimes, but Yuuri is starting to wonder if he intends it. Maybe\u2014maybe this time is different. It\u2019s been months. The words that come from his mouth now are similar to the banquet, but he and Yuuri have been together since the summer.</p>\n<p>Maybe Viktor will stay.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy feelings for you have never been the problem! I meant\u2026 what I said, just now. I\u2019ve always meant it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even when Viktor hadn\u2019t. But maybe now he does, maybe Yuuri can believe. He\u2019ll always wonder, but if he gets Viktor, only for a time, he can try to believe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d the other man says, voice gentle as the brush of his fingers on Yuuri\u2019s face. His voice still trembles on the next words. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head fiercely, the tears leaking out, Viktor\u2019s hand pulling back. \u201cOf course I want you. But you won\u2019t want me,\u201d he babbles, \u201cyou won\u2019t. Someday soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Viktor says, and his voice sounds as if he\u2019s in agony, \u201cI always will. I always have, too, I\u2019ve always meant it\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Yuuri stiffens instantly, lets out a sob, and Viktor cuts himself off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>haven\u2019t</em>. Don\u2019t say that you have, Viktor, it\u2019s never been the same for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His expression is morphing. \u201cIs this because I\u2019m a celebrity? A gold medalist? Is that the problem? You think I\u2019m not capable of feeling anything for anyone, I\u2019ll just cheat on you with whoever comes along like those awful tabloids keep saying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the beginning,\u201d Yuuri grits out miserably. \u201cThat too.\u201d He knows Viktor isn\u2019t like that, now. Viktor is warm and sweet and childish and still the man who promised Yuuri everything he\u2019d ever dreamed of at the banquet and never, ever meant it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>too</em>? Three minutes ago we were making love and you <em>loved me</em> and now I\u2019m gold medalist Viktor Nikiforov, playboy extraordinaire?\u201d The anger is palpable despite the calm and flat tone, his hands fisting in the sheets and pulling, dragging them away from where they\u2019re covering Yuuri. It\u2019s not intentional. It still makes Yuuri vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Until he sees the tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you crying?\u201d He asks, timid. He reaches up to peer beneath the fringe and Viktor slaps his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m crying,\u201d Viktor snaps, \u201cI\u2019m mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pulls back, stares at him as the tears continue to roll.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to believe you,\u201d Yuuri realizes, the feeling coming full circle. He still voices it aloud for Viktor to shoot down. \u201cYou want us to be together.\u201d Maybe Viktor will stay. Maybe Viktor will <em>stay</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to convince you of that for months. Should I stop trying? Tell me to stop trying, Yuuri, if you don\u2019t want me. I\u2019ll leave you alone. I\u2019m not that selfish, not when it comes to you. Just <em>talk to me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d Yuuri says, firmly. Every touch. Every kiss. <em>Real</em>. \u201cStay close to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fight washes from Viktor, easing immediately. He sits back on his heels and just stares, looking strangely small and tired. Yuuri reaches for where his fist is tight around the sheets. It loosens, lets his fingers in until they\u2019re intertwined.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s shower,\u201d Yuuri tells him, soft.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s frame is limp, in the shower, pliant as he lets Yuuri wash him. If Viktor means it, this time, then Yuuri is the one that has to apologize. Following the banquet Viktor lied to him and ignored him for months, afterwards, and never acknowledged it, teased Yuuri with it\u2014 but that was only once. Viktor acts as though he\u2019s been desperate for months. Now he\u2019s despondent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri says, \u201cI am. I shouldn\u2019t have said those things to you. I shouldn\u2019t have made you cry. I was scared because you\u2019ve hurt me before.\u201d It\u2019s the closest he\u2019s come to saying it, to acknowledging it aloud, since he first tried to probe the subject with Viktor the day he moved in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d Viktor says instantly, \u201cI am. I\u2019ll try to never hurt you again. Especially what I said at the Cup of China, that was foolish. I know I apologized then but I\u2019ll say it again now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m to blame too.\u201d People changed. Yuuri shouldn\u2019t have held the banquet against Viktor for so long. He\u2019d been tipsy, high off his own victory, and probably thought Yuuri wouldn\u2019t take his promises seriously. Not like now, when they\u2019re roommates and rinkmates and\u2014</p>\n<p>He takes Viktor\u2019s face between his hands, leans up and kisses him, heavy and dripping with water.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Viktor whimpers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d he says, \u201cnever.\u201d Then, quieter, \u201cplease don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor promises, lips soft and fingers entwining with Yuuri\u2019s under the spray, and Yuuri is starting to believe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Madame Baranovskaya sighs, sharp, when he sees her. \u201cAn ever-changing danseur,\u201d she intones. \u201cWe will work with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The media becomes the third member of their relationship three weeks before the Rostelecom Cup. They\u2019re coming back from dinner, and a paparazzo snaps a picture of them and approaches Yuuri on the street with a confident, completely destructive, \u201chow does it feel to have Viktor Nikiforov as your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>A younger Yuuri had practiced this answer religiously, into a mirror, had mused on it during sleepless nights. Now, all he says is a disaffected,</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse us for a moment,\u201d Viktor says calmly, steering Yuuri into the nearest store by his elbow, as the paparazzo fumbles for his tape recorder. They\u2019ve wandered into an antiques gallery, and Yuuri likes the smell of it\u2014velvet and old varnish, aged wooden picture frames. It\u2019s quiet, and faded sunbeams are weaving through the dust. \u201cYuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe agree that things have changed, yes?\u201d He waits for Yuuri\u2019s nod, then plows onward. \u201cI could be your boyfriend,\u201d he says, and Yuuri doesn\u2019t even hear the words that follow, just plants his frantic eyes on Viktor\u2019s moving lips and waits for something impossible to happen, like the antique store catching flame, to indicate to him that it\u2019s a dream. Viktor is asking him to date, again, and this time Yuuri\u2026 <em>believes</em> him.</p>\n<p>Then, Viktor\u2019s lips stop moving. Yuuri\u2019s mind tunes back in, looks up to where blue eyes are still locked on him, brow low. He must have asked a question, but all Yuuri knows to say is,</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Viktor repeats, careful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri says, \u201cI want to be your boyfriend.\u201d He pauses, looks down at the wooden floors, the gentle sweeping of dust. \u201cWanted to,\u201d he admits, before he can stop himself, \u201cduring the summer, too. But you already know that.\u201d When he looks back up, Viktor\u2019s smile is a wide, all-encompassing thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you are,\u201d he says. \u201cMy boyfriend. You have been, since the summer. We\u2019re deciding after the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri buries his face in his hands, shuffles on his feet. \u201cYou can hug me, you know,\u201d he whispers. Viktor does so. Enthusiastically.</p>\n<p>When the paparazzo enters the store, Viktor is in the middle of purchasing a lovely set of china.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou break it, you buy it,\u201d the old shopkeeper is exclaiming, in Russian. Yuuri\u2019s face is red as he sweeps with a tiny broom at the shards of a teacup. While he cleans a voice recorder is eagerly shoved at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does it feel to have Viktor Nikiforov as your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight now,\u201d Yuuri squeaks, to the progressively more confused paparazzo, \u201clike I\u2019ve just been handed the first thing I really want to hold onto.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you call that feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s response makes Viktor drop the newly purchased tea set with a harmonic, singing shatter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps, when put beside the Cup of China, the Rostelecom Cup is not as exciting in comparison.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Nikiforov, how do you feel about competing against your boyfriend of several months in the Rostelecom Cup?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019ll do wonderfully!\u201d Viktor announces, perfect grin in place, \u201cwe skate for each other, so any success belongs to both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can <em>pinpoint</em> the exact moment when the reporter, and probably millions of viewers, start to melt. They hate Yuuri, still, for taking him. But they can\u2019t help themselves when Viktor turns on the charm, and Yuuri can\u2019t judge them when his own heart is melting too, leaking out his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny success belongs to both of us, really? So I can take gold?\u201d Yuuri teases in the locker rooms. \u201cOr are you going to admit that what you said was just for the sake of the press?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, Yuuri,\u201d Viktor replies, innocently offended. \u201cI meant every word. But I can take the gold, and we\u2019ll share it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know why you two are <em>having</em> this discussion!\u201d Yuri hollers from somewhere in the showers. \u201cI\u2019m going to take the gold and you two <em>saps</em> are going to have to fight JJ, of all people, for silver!\u201d Viktor runs a hand through his hair, comes in close, leans down to whisper in Yuuri\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is Yuri talking about?\u201d He questions. Yuuri pushes him, laughs.</p>\n<p>The champion sweeps the locker room with lazy eyes, then steps forward and presses a kiss to Yuuri\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would love to take a vacation to Barcelona together,\u201d he hums, pulling back, blue eyes crinkling. \u201cYakov has to approve if we\u2019re both already there, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shrugs, smiles cheekily up at him. \u201cWell, if we both don\u2019t make it I\u2019ll just vacation with Yuri. We\u2019ll send you pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot <em>believe</em> you are the same shy man who showed up at my apartment this last summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words fly out before Yuuri can think about them. \u201cAm I still the same man from the Sochi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor rubs a thumb over his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t think about Sochi. This year is going to be different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you never think about Sochi?\u201d Yuuri questions, and he\u2019s scared of the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really?\u201d Viktor hums. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the same for me as it was for you, with what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri already knows this, but it stings to hear. Viktor\u2019s hand is still on his face. Yuuri takes it with his own, swings it down to their sides and lets go. It doesn\u2019t matter, he knows, it <em>shouldn\u2019t matter</em>. It was one night, and now they\u2019ve had so many more together. They\u2019re <em>together</em>. But it was their beginning, and Yuuri is still secretly terrified, still waiting, for it to become their end.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on the ice, Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEyes on you,\u201d Viktor says, so soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Viktor Nikiforov, in essentially top form mentally and physically, is an unstoppable competitor. Even Yuuri and Yuri Plisetsky nipping at his heels can\u2019t slow him\u2014Yuuri knows the man is going to land five quads in the Rostlecom Cup, has <em>seen</em> Viktor run through his program, and it still takes his breath away. He pities those with less preparation of their heart.</p>\n<p>Yuuri, wrapped up in an oncoming wave of tension and anxiety, takes fourth. Somehow, this is enough\u2014Christophe, in a shocking upset, hadn\u2019t managed to take higher than third at his event.</p>\n<p>The GPF will be Phichit, Otabek Altin, Yuri, JJ Leroy, Viktor\u2014and Yuuri. Again.</p>\n<p>Another GPF with Viktor, and Yuuri tries to look forward to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri is stretching out on the floor, palm of his hand to sole of his foot, gentle. It had been a good day. Practice in the studio with the other danseurs, working on his own form for another hour afterwards while Madame Baranovskaya did paperwork in a nearby office.</p>\n<p>Now she is back in front of him, staring down with steely eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know why I began to dance, Mr. Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shakes his head. \u201cNo, madame.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words are sure. \u201cIt\u2019s because I felt myself unbearably ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri falls out of his stretch, stares up at her. He has been to Yakov\u2019s house, following lightly at Viktor\u2019s heels or trailing behind him with their hands linked, dropping off borscht they made together or paperwork the champion had forgotten. Viktor has no reservations about treating Yakov\u2019s home as his own space, and by the second time they visited Yuuri knew why, saw it held in every photo frame. Viktor and Yakov. Viktor and Madame Baranovskaya. Viktor wedged between both of them, so very small.</p>\n<p>Every ballerina is beautiful, when in makeup and costume and defying gravity and blood up on stage. But Madame Baranovskaya, Yuuri knows, was also beautiful off stage.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he admits, quietly. One perfect eyebrow raises at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou admitting this is yet another thing that sets you apart from other students. Yuri becomes frustrated at misunderstanding, and Vitya avoids until he can take action.\u201d Yuuri continues to stare at her. \u201cUp.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stumbles to his feet. Every natural movement of his body in front of Madame Baranovskaya feels like he\u2019s failing a test.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing so ugly,\u201d she continues calmly, as though this makes perfect sense, \u201cI wanted to change myself so thoroughly that others would look to me on stage and say: <em>how far Lilia Baranovskaya has come</em>.\u201d A pause then, carefully timed. \u201cKatsuki. Do you think this made me prima ballerina?\u201d</p>\n<p>The obvious answer is <em>yes</em>, because Lillia had been.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d Yuuri asks, unsteady.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I became prima ballerina,\u201d she says, \u201cit was because they would look to me on stage and say: <em>who is that beautiful monster</em>.\u201d She comes to him, tilts his chin up in unshaking, perfect hands. \u201cDestroy your past self, and only use the beautiful pieces. Every time you take the stage you are a new man, Katsuki Yuuri, with something new to prove.\u201d Her eyes, burning on his. \u201cWe do not let old lives dance with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Redemption does not exist. There is only rebirth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri goes home, toes off his shoes. Viktor is lying on the couch, curled up with Makkachin and a book, and when Yuuri comes in his perfect jaw darts upwards, eyes fearful and shining with joy. Viktor\u2019s <em>scared</em> of him, Yuuri realizes\u2014perhaps not him, but something about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d he says, and Yuuri doesn\u2019t reply, just takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them up. Makkachin thumps off the couch and pushes her nose at him, till Yuuri obliges and tussles fondly at her ears. She shuffles off, curls bouncing, to the guest bedroom. The room is essentially hers, now.</p>\n<p>He pads across the floor to Viktor, still tucked into the couch cushions, his book open on his chest. Yuuri straddles the champion\u2019s long legs, props himself up on his elbows on the armrest so he\u2019s held aloft above the perfect arrangement of silver and blue, creamy white skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d he says, soft. \u201cLove you. How was your day, Vitya?\u201d</p>\n<p>The reply never comes, just Viktor sitting beneath him with a working throat and downturned, wide eyes. Yuuri brushes at his silver fringe with one hand, suddenly nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need a moment,\u201d Viktor breathes. \u201cJust give me a moment, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Yuuri blurts. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d The other man just shakes his head, lifts up and presses a trembling kiss to the edge of Yuuri\u2019s mouth, mumbles something in Russian so quietly that Yuuri can\u2019t catch it. Yuuri\u2019s heart is still pulsing in his chest, winding up, and he presses another kiss down to the pale cheek. When he pulls back, Viktor\u2019s beaming up at him, heart-shaped grin and shining blue eyes and all, and before he really registers it there are arms pressing on his back, collapsing him down onto the other man with a laughing protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmph,\u201d he says into the broad chest, \u201cViktor, Viktor, I\u2019m ruining your book. Let me up.\u201d Between them, Viktor\u2019s hand darts and slides the book out, stretches one arm above his head to place it lightly on the coffee table. Yuuri reaches up, pins him by one wrist, leans down and steals his lips again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked you a question, Vitya.\u201d On his back, Viktor\u2019s free hand fists in the fabric of his shirt, his breath quickening. \u201cI won\u2019t tolerate you ignoring me. How,\u201d he kisses again, \u201cwas,\u201d Viktor kisses him, this time, \u201cyour day,\u201d Makkachin jumps up behind them on the couch, whines, \u201cVitya?\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile is real, the laughter unending. <em>I want you,</em> Yuuri thinks, <em>oh, I want to hold you and catch you, and keep you. This time, you\u2019re letting me.</em></p>\n<p>Viktor waits to regain his breath, to stare up with eyes devoted and sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful day,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cThe best day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They arrive in Barcelona, the beautiful Spanish city, swooping architecture and the steam of street food, and all Yuuri wants is his headache to disappear with a nap.</p>\n<p>Viktor, soaked from the pool, climbs atop him in bed after said nap and ruins all the sheets with the clean tang of chlorine. Yuuri complains for five minutes, until Viktor pulls him into the tiny hotel shower, and he can\u2019t think of anything to complain about, anymore.</p>\n<p>The next day, shopping. Christmas lights in Barcelona.</p>\n<p>Yuuri makes the best snap decision of his life. Maybe even better than a quadruple flip in the Cup of China. Admittedly, maybe they weren\u2019t emotional spur of the moment decisions. He\u2019s been practicing a quadruple flip since he was twenty-one. He\u2019s been planning on marrying Viktor since approximately one day after he first saw him on a television screen, and Yuuko had giggled, <em>do you like him too, Yuuri? He\u2019s so handsome, so stunning everyone wants to be with him.</em></p>\n<p>Handsome is a true word, just like someone could describe Viktor\u2019s eyes as blue. Neither are anywhere close to the breathtaking reality. But Viktor is Viktor in his elated twirls with their bags while they\u2019re shopping, the warm focus he has to him, the implicit trust and understanding and communication he offers along with his gloved hand.</p>\n<p>Yuuri pulls off the glove. Puts on the golden ring.</p>\n<p>Later, at a restaurant, when Viktor tells a choking Yuri Plisetsky, a gracious Otabek Altin, and a delighted Phichit that it\u2019s an <em>engagement ring, we\u2019ll get married when Yuuri beats me in competition and takes gold</em>, and Yuri hollers \u201cif he misses <em>one practice with me</em> because of you I will\u2014\u201c Yuuri can\u2019t even say he\u2019s surprised. Just grateful, and a bit unsettled, and deeply, deeply in love.</p>\n<p><em>Only a year ago</em>, he thinks warmly, <em>look at how far you and I have come</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they return to the hotel, loaded up with purchases and newly escaped from the combined social horrors of JJ and his sister\u2019s or Minako\u2019s fangirling, Yuuri could go to bed and sleep straight through the short program. Viktor, lively as always, is far more interested in distractions.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me <em>see</em>,\u201d Viktor complains. \u201cI didn\u2019t take plane selfies on your phone for them to never see the light of day again!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri just wants to sleep. Grouchily, he shoves his phone into Viktor\u2019s palm, rolls back over in bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the gallery,\u201d he groans, muffled, into his pillow. \u201cYou know the password.\u201d He just gets a gleeful hum in response. Yuuri relaxes, almost falls into unconsciousness when there\u2019s a sudden, trembling,</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha,\u201d he says into the pillow, half asleep. \u201cRest, Viktor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, what is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s fear, in the tone. Deep, unsettled fear. Suddenly, sleep feels a million miles away. Yuuri rises up on his forearms, prays that Viktor has not looked into the folder he thinks he has.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is\u2014us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks. The fates are not kind. He closes his eyes, feeling dizzy. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have kept the pictures. Viktor was tipsy. He was drunk. It\u2019s embarrassing, to have them, to admit that they\u2019re on his phone. That they\u2019re backed up on his laptop with the rest of his pictures of his time with the champion. That on any night Viktor isn\u2019t there, he looks through them, wonders how long he has left.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, I don\u2019t...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he blurts. He flips up the covers, swings his feet out of bed. \u201cIt was stupid. To keep them. I know you don\u2019t want to talk about that night and things are different now and we don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Viktor commands, and it\u2019s desperate. Yuuri stops tugging on his slippers, and Viktor puts a hand over his face and takes in two gasping breaths. \u201cYuuri, please. Sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gingerly, Yuuri does. \u201cViktor. Are you mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMad?\u201d With one shaking finger, the silver-haired man swipes at the phone screen where it lays on the bed, switches to a new picture. Yuuri and Viktor dancing, Yuuri and Viktor twirling about one another, Yuuri dipping him. Then, later, in the dark of the ballroom, them lying flat on the ground with the camera held above, Viktor pressing a kiss to Yuuri\u2019s cheek as their hair fans out black and silver behind them. That one is blurry from the trembling of alcohol, from their giggling. It\u2019s Yuuri\u2019s favorite. \u201cOh,\u201d he breathes. \u201c<em>Oh</em>, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tumbling forward, Yuuri takes the phone back. Viktor\u2019s response to finding the pictures isn\u2019t anywhere close to the awkward laugh Yuuri had foolishly hoped for.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he\u2019s babbling then, \u201cplease don\u2019t\u2014make fun of me. For keeping them. I know it didn\u2019t mean anything to you then, some drunken stupid thing, and I was just some fan that failed to skate, but if you laugh, if you leave me again, you\u2019ll break my\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>He cuts off in a sob, crumples in on himself, and turns his back to Viktor. Viktor, and the bed that\u2019s become theirs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d There\u2019s a light creaking, and Yuuri\u2019s being turned around, slim fingers catching him by the hip. \u201cI don\u2019t remember this, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s face jerks up, heart trembling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he chokes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember that night. Any of it. I was\u2014I must have been\u2014drunk. Sometimes when I drink, I\u2026 black out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri says, shaking his head wildly, \u201cI was drunk. You were just\u2014tipsy. You seemed\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hold my liquor,\u201d Viktor murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m Russian and I hold it very well. Mostly I just take off my clothes.\u201d His eyes dart to the phone, still clenched in Yuuri\u2019s hand, then back to Yuuri\u2019s face, horror dawning in his eyes. \u201cLeave you again?\u201d Yuuri steps forward, away from Viktor\u2019s hands, nods stiffly. He\u2019s still trying to process the words, the last few months, to see them from Viktor\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat night, we\u2026 we were like we are now. We were close. I came into your life and promised things to you, and then never contacted you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you came here, and I flirted with you, and I barged into your life again and never mentioned it\u2014<em>God</em>, Yuuri, you must have been so confused.\u201d There\u2019s agony now, in his voice, and it startles Yuuri, makes him look up into blue eyes. \u201cEvery time you were distant, it was because of this, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot every time. Just\u2014yes, because of that, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor bites his lip, hand coming up to hover next to Yuuri\u2019s cheek. Yuuri\u2019s knees tremble from where he stands beside the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I touch you?\u201d</p>\n<p>A nod. Viktor wraps arms around him, pulls him in close. Then soft kisses are being pressed to the top of his head, his ear, his shoulder, from where Viktor kneels on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shudders. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, quietly, \u201cjust don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t leave me again. Don\u2019t forget me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will never. Yuuri, I want to\u2026 when I said these were engagement rings, I meant it. I want to marry you. I don\u2019t ever want to leave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to marry you too,\u201d Yuuri whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped that,\u201d Viktor laughs, the sound belying his sudden tight grip, \u201cwhen you <em>proposed</em> to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They are still for a few moments, till Yuuri swings himself out of Viktor\u2019s arms to sit, still tense, on the bed beside the Russian. Viktor\u2019s staring off now, into the dark and away from Yuuri, expression wavering and unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole time. It was you.\u201d Viktor presses his trembling hands to his face. \u201cThey tried to tell me. Oh, <em>Yuuri</em>, they tried to tell me about you at first. Christophe and Yakov and Mila and even Yuri. Asking me if I\u2019d <em>enjoyed</em> the banquet, and all I could think was that I\u2019d finally gotten wasted in front of sponsors. Christophe kept talking about how I\u2019d danced with another skater and had fun and asked if I wanted to see pictures and\u2014I\u2019m so sorry, Yuuri. I was in such a dark place after Sochi that I couldn\u2019t even imagine having feelings like that for anyone. Couldn\u2019t imagine\u2026 feeling much of anything at all. All I had were medals and quickly dying inspiration and screaming fans that didn\u2019t know me, and the approval of judges and the ISU. I don\u2019t even <em>like</em> the ISU, Yuuri. Every time my rinkmates mentioned the banquet with those knowing smiles it was like they were mocking me for the lack of life and love. I deleted anything they sent me, and tried not to think about it.\u201d A deep breath. \u201cI just wanted to finish the season, and skate, and sleep. I slept all the time. I practiced and slept and drank. Then I got better and after that you came and\u2026\u201d He looks up, bites at his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor,\u201d he says, quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t say sorry. I\u2019m not blaming you. I could never blame you. If you ever feel like that again, Yakov and I are here for you through it.\u201d Yuuri pulls them back so they lay on the bed, strokes at Viktor\u2019s arm with a watery chuckle. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, this\u2014I thought\u2014every day, I thought <em>this could be like the morning after the banquet.</em> I thought you\u2019d leave me again, but I\u2019d finally come to terms with it, and the entire time you didn\u2019t even <em>know</em>. You were right\u2014I was cruel, and I\u2019m sorry, Viktor. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor squeezes tight, wedges his knee between Yuuri\u2019s legs and his ear to Yuuri\u2019s beating heart. Yuuri remembers holding the wedding bands, fresh from the glass counter\u2014cool and smooth, untouched. Now, entangled together, they\u2019re warm and heavy. Finally, the older man responds,</p>\n<p>\u201cI was worse to you.\u201d As Yuuri opens his mouth to refute this, Viktor shakes his head, silver hair shifting against Yuuri\u2019s lips, and it quiets the Japanese skater. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it up to each other,\u201d he promises, finally. \u201cWe have our entire lives.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ah</em>, Yuuri thinks, a whole year collecting as a painful, happy swell in his throat, <em>we do</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri is so determined to take first in the short program that he <em>can\u2019t</em>. Yuri Plisetsky, youthful rage and passion personified, knocks Viktor to second place.</p>\n<p>Overall, it is a scraping and bloody day, and Yuuri just wants to lay with his fianc\u00e9 and consider how he can somehow improve his mediocrity, can somehow properly demonstrate his love by skating, in the next forty-eight hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should talk,\u201d come the words, in the cab ride home.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he sighs.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk until Viktor is freshly showered, and Yuuri is situated on the edge of their bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor pulls his bathrobe around him, smiles. Yuuri knows this smile\u2014knows it\u2019s not entirely real. The droplets that cling to his hair, his cheeks, are tempting, and Yuuri wants to collect them with his tongue. Knowing that he\u2019s allowed, that Viktor would encourage it, is half the appeal. So Yuuri scoots forward, flashes him a grin in return, places a hand on Viktor\u2019s knee. Then, Viktor breaks him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, after the GPF\u2026 I\u2019m going to end this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>I knew it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The response is instant. Every doubt he\u2019s had about his relationship with Viktor falls and burns, hitting his chest in an immediate meteoric shower of fear. <em>Again, you\u2019re leaving me again, it\u2019s the banquet it\u2019s the banquet\u2014</em> Viktor didn\u2019t know. Viktor didn\u2019t know about the banquet. Yuuri has faith.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Yuuri wishes he were like Viktor\u2014collected and optimistic and not someone who has to lean over and dig half-moons into their knees with their nails when others talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He finally chokes out. He\u2019s sure his face is blotchy, the tears about to burst forth. \u201cTell me what you mean.\u201d <em>At least admit it to me, this time</em>.</p>\n<p>Viktor smiles again, moves to sit beside him on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m retiring, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>The burning constriction in his chest clenches, halts. \u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d This is the last thing he had been expecting to hear. \u201cIs this because Yuri took first in the short? Viktor, you\u2019re not losing your touch, you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not,\u201d Viktor admits. \u201cI could keep skating. I could have another season or two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen <em>why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Yuuri.\u201d Viktor\u2019s voice is still calm, decided. \u201cYakov is doing his best, but his attention is divided. You need more\u2014you <em>deserve</em> more. With you and Yuri and Mila and me on top of it all, Yakov can\u2019t devote time to you. I\u2019ve been skating since I was a child, Yuuri, and this season, with you beside me\u2026 It\u2019s better than I could have ever imagined my last season to be\u2014skating, and life, and...\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, black hair shifting, glasses threatening to tip from his nose with the violent movements of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love skating,\u201d Yuuri whispers. He is in fourth, after the short program. \u201cViktor, you <em>love</em> skating, I\u2019m not worth this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love <em>you</em>,\u201d Viktor corrects, \u201cand you are worthy of everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor means it, he wholeheartedly means that curling, dancing <em>everything</em> that falls from his tongue, with every fiber of his being. The spark in his blue eyes, the taut hope of him, every twist of his blades on the ice\u2014he means it. He means it, and it still breaks Yuuri\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>In the morning, Yuuri speaks with Yakov. Asks to sign the papers, even as Yakov yells at him, boisterous and loud and concerned, hollers at him to reconsider.</p>\n<p>Two days before the free skate of the Barcelona GPF, Katsuki Yuuri decides to retire.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have you done,\u201d Viktor says, later that night, hair wet from his shower. Yuuri still wants to lick the water from the curve of his collarbones, to take the whole of Viktor\u2019s being in his palm and press it tight, private, to his chest. But setting Viktor, uncontainable, beautiful Viktor, free\u2014that\u2019s how Yuuri shows his love.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re each making our own decision,\u201d he says, quietly.</p>\n<p>Viktor\u2019s phone hangs from his hand, Yakov\u2019s image fading from the screen. His voice breaks to let the next words tumble from it, raw. \u201cYuuri, what have you <em>done</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The days before the free skate are tense. They still eat together, sleep together, Viktor pulling so close Yuuri can hardly breathe with it.</p>\n<p>The morning of the free skate, Viktor rolls over, slides his arms around him. The heated whisper against his ear has his blood flow reversing directions, the world tilting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you beat me easily, Yuuri,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I really want to kiss your gold medal.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I still want you. I\u2019ve always meant it. I\u2019ve always wanted you</em>.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shudders in his arms and cries, holds Viktor tighter. When he\u2019s finished he leans up, finds Viktor\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat if,\u201d he hums, \u201cYurio beats you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d he gasps dramatically, \u201cyou wound me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri sighs, \u201cYurio will, if you beat him and then make a scene on the podium.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m spontaneous,\u201d Viktor huffs, \u201cno one can say what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri can. Yuuri can say that Viktor loves him, will love him tomorrow, can say it with the smooth confidence of Viktor\u2019s movements on the ice. Anxiety still clings heavy to his back, weighs down his shadow no matter where he goes, but it can\u2019t take this love from him. Twenty years from now\u2014who can say? Maybe he and Viktor will have been separated by time and circumstances. But this\u2014love, they\u2019ll always have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuri on Ice begins to play.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let Viktor retire, not for him. He can\u2019t take Viktor\u2019s whole world away just to gamble it on his own career. But Yuuri can show himself here, with his free program, his final words and the proclamation of his love.</p>\n<p>Everything comes to an end. When it does, he looks down his arm, the aloft angle of his wrist, to where his lover waits for him. Viktor had watched. Yakov had known better than to try to stop him. His mouth hangs open, tears still shining at the corner of his eyes. For the first and only time, Yuuri doesn\u2019t want to go to him, doesn\u2019t want his embrace. But he has to go to Viktor\u2019s side, and there\u2019s never been another choice for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did so wonderfully,\u201d he says, \u201cmy Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better give me a good challenge, Vitya.\u201d Viktor laughs, takes him into waiting arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you all my love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov is waiting for him, too, in the small space of time they have while Otabek skates. Yuuri joins him and a focused Yurio.</p>\n<p>\u201cThrowing an extra jump in there,\u201d Yakov snaps, \u201crearranging your piece to be more backloaded. You are meant to be the only student that listens to me, Katsuki, and instead you break the world record without even a <em>warning</em> to your coach.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri says, subdued. \u201cSir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think you don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Yakov says, grim. \u201cBut I am proud of you, and your emotion-driven rebelliousness, if it\u2019s an expression of who you are. You are my skater, Katsuki. Still will be, even after you\u2019ve retired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio looks up, then, even as Yuuri feels grateful tears welling. \u201cRetired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYura,\u201d Yakov says sternly, a warning. Yurio doesn\u2019t back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you retiring, Katsudon?\u201d Yuuri bites his lip, nods, and the younger skater explodes. \u201cYou <em>idiot</em>, you <em>asshole</em>, I can\u2019t believe\u2014I\u2019m going to <em>destroy you,</em> and you won\u2019t even <em>think</em> about leaving the ice after I\u2019m done with you! I won\u2019t listen to your coaching if you retire! I will hunt you down in Japan, I know how to find people\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0When Yurio takes the ice, there\u2019s a beautiful ferocity to it. When Yurio passes his score, it almost offsets the sinking disappointment in Yuuri\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>Still, at the ceremony, bronze medal about his neck and two people he loves standing with him, so different from the pressure that had choked him the year before\u2014he can\u2019t be too disappointed.</p>\n<p>The champion had barely outdone Yurio, but it had been enough.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been roommates, rinkmates, lovers, for months, and Viktor still surprises him on the podium.</p>\n<p>He holds out his gold medal, looped around his neck, and Yuuri realizes he\u2019s meant to kiss it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou broke my world record,\u201d Viktor says, with a smile. \u201cI may have taken gold, but everything else belongs to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri reaches up to finger at it\u2014the sleek, warm shine. Then, he pulls.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s Katsuki Yuuri, current world record holder and bronze medalist, kissing his boyfriend and six-time gold medalist Viktor Nikiforov in public. This is certainly a world record for celebrity kisses, folks, I don\u2019t think any other pair has been quite so bold in their displays! Let\u2019s see what their coach, and the only coach in the history of figure skating to have three students make the podium at once, has to say!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yakov, as it turns out, has very little to say. His face is red, huge with the lecture he is holding in. Beside him, Lilia Baranovskaya gives a judgmental little sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally,\u201d she tuts, flatly, \u201che goes and orchestrates this, collects Katsuki from Japan all to make Vitya happy, and doesn\u2019t even try to enjoy it.\u201d The interview, despite being a mere 15 seconds long, trends for a full month on social media. After Yuuri sees it one day at practice, he hides in the bathroom for a full twenty minutes before emerging and wrapping himself into a blanket with Yakov. After Viktor sees it the first time, he buys Yakov a vacation to the Bahamas.</p>\n<p>A reporter is holding a microphone to Viktor\u2019s lips now, the camera panning back so it captures his arms slung about Yuuri and Yurio, whose emotions at medaling and having Viktor wrapped around him are clearly fighting a war on his face. Several professional skating questions have already been asked, but the media is ready to move on to more personal and scandalous things.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and your boyfriend have taken gold and bronze,\u201d the reporter begins. She doesn\u2019t even get to finish the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy <em>boyfriend</em>,\u201d Viktor laughs, tone sternly offended and expression ridiculously delighted. Yurio lets out a screech and pushes at him, while Viktor clamps down his arm around both of them. \u201cThis is my <em>fianc\u00e9</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The media stops maintaining any fa\u00e7ade of calm professionalism. Yuuri smiles, just a smile in a tomato red face as Viktor fields questions like he\u2019d <em>practiced</em> for this, curls his hand around Yuuri\u2019s shoulder so the ring shows off <em>just so</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsudon,\u201d Yurio rages, \u201c<em>Katsudon!</em>\u201d He frees himself from Viktor\u2019s grip, and together they break away, stumbling through the press mob with the raging hurricane force of Yurio\u2019s snarls.</p>\n<p>When they make it outside onto the streets, into relative quiet, Yuuri hugs him. Yuri spasms and shrieks, brings his arms around to scratch at Yuuri\u2019s back before he squeezes, briefly, in return.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Yurio. Your free skate\u2026 you and Madame Baranovskaya worked so hard. It was stunning, groundbreaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it was, it had to be,\u201d Yurio scoffs, \u201cto beat you. But just wait for my exhibition. Katsudon, out there, you\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t finish, and they separate, Yurio\u2019s face locked in a scowl. \u201cHow long do you think your idiot is going to be trapped in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri muses, \u201ctill the other press conference later, at least. We should have time for dinner. Do you want to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if they have katsudon,\u201d Yurio snaps. His expression is breaking into a tiny smile. \u201cBecause you deserve that.\u201d Yuuri laughs, brings out his phone to check, but Yuri isn\u2019t done. \u201cAnd only if we invite Otabek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour friend from dinner the other night?\u201d Yuuri asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Yurio says, and <em>pops</em> the p.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should invite Viktor, actually,\u201d Yuuri ventures tentatively, \u201cso we can both get to know Otabek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God</em>,\u201d Yurio huffs, \u201cif you have to. If Viktor thinks he can get out. Also, you dorks have to be cool. Otabek is <em>cool</em>, do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d better be,\u201d Yuuri says with a smile of his own. His phone dings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viktor</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Of course I can get out of a press mob, darling, who do you think I am?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yuuri</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Maybe you don\u2019t want out of the press mob, Vitya, with that shiny gold ring. I know exactly who you are.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viktor</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You do know me, Yuuri. You do. I\u2019ll see you soon, solnyshko.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Otabek is a nice boy, really, and a great skater. Viktor and Yuuri will have to watch out for him.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, they busy themselves with stealing bites from Yurio\u2019s plate, to holding hands underneath the table as they sit next to each other in the booth.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome to the banquet,\u201d Yurio commands Otabek, who agrees to attend without much thought or visible emotion.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome to the banquet,\u201d Viktor whispers in his ear, \u201cso you can make me fall in love with you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the third time?\u201d Yuuri asks, interlaced fingers tightening. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that seem like too many times, Vitya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Viktor promises, \u201cand again, and again\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can <em>see</em> you,\u201d Yurio hisses, \u201cwe can see you, you <em>promised</em> to be cool, Katsudon.\u201d Yuuri pushes a whining Viktor away from him playfully, focuses. Viktor sighs pitifully and whispers a question in his ear to ask the Kazakh.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell us about your time in Russia,\u201d Yuuri redirects shyly, and from the widening of the reserved younger man\u2019s eyes, he knows the evening will be a good one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re back at the hotel, Yuuri holds his medal up to Viktor. Every success belongs to both of them, even the smaller ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t beat you,\u201d he says, voice small. \u201cI didn\u2019t beat you, and now I have no coach. I signed the documents breaking it off with Yakov.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viktor swallows, takes the medal with careful hands. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA dangerous thing,\u201d Yuuri hums, \u201cwhen it comes to your sharp mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri expects Viktor to break his promise about their engagement, then, with the softness in his eyes. To break it in a gentle and renewing way, to demand they marry right then, honeymoon in Barcelona even if Yuuri\u2019s medal isn\u2019t the right color. He expects sweetness, and honest kisses, and a sunset all by themselves from a tall tower in Barcelona where they\u2019re even with the skyline, arms around one another.</p>\n<p>Viktor surprises him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri. I\u2019ve been thinking about what I can do for you, from now on, as\u2026 your coach. If you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri sits on the bed, and laughs. Laughs, and cries. Viktor sits with him, hands darting and unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri, darling, if this isn\u2019t what you want\u2014I know it sounds insane, coaching and skating at the same time, but I hoped you\u2019d let me do this, I\u2019m confident I can do this\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cViktor,\u201d Yuuri interrupts. Stops him entirely, with a finger to his lips, the laughter taking over, the tears dissipating. \u201cViktor, are you <em>sure</em> you forgot the banquet?\u201d</p>\n<p>The silver-haired man startles, nods his head. \u201cI swear to you I did. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t apologize enough, for that. But what does that have to do with now?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I should really Facetime okaa-san and otou-san</em>, Yuuri thinks. They\u2019ve met Viktor over it, several times, mostly since right before the Rostelecom Cup. But this is something else entirely. This, and their rings\u2014something else entirely. Maybe he should book a flight. Two flights.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already asked you to be my coach,\u201d Yuuri whispers, \u201cand you said yes, Vitya. <em>Oh</em>, you said yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Worlds begins. This time, Katsuki Yuuri goes home to his apartment in Russia, to a barking Yakov and a surly but determined Yuri and a laughing Mila, to his fianc\u00e9 and coach\u2014he goes home with the gold.</p>"
