  "text": "<p>\u201cGood morning, Detective Reed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin clenches his jaw, bites back any retort he might have made before androids were granted their equal rights, and gives a stiff nod without turning away from his terminal. \u201cYeah, mornin\u2019. Whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see Connor\u2019s little smile, but he knows it\u2019s there. Twitchy and awkward, though everything about the plastic prick\u2013 <em>android</em>, Gavin firmly reminds himself, is twitchy and awkward; from his blinky eyes to his fucking walk cycle. He hears him walking away now, shoe heels clacking against the DPD's hard floor and footsteps perfectly balanced.</p>\n<p>Still felt weird to have an android working there. Disconcerting and alien, but Gavin wasn\u2019t about to say it out loud. He might have five months ago, and he probably wouldn\u2019t have used such tame language to go along with it. But after Markus had shaken hands with President Warren on national TV, thoughts like Gavin\u2019s suddenly weren\u2019t voiced in places like police precincts anymore.</p>\n<p>There are laws now. Regulations. And Gavin isn\u2019t stupid enough to run his mouth around the other officers. That, and he\u2019d seen Markus\u2019s people protesting on the news that <em>oh-so</em> fateful night in November. He'd heard about the android recycling camps all over Detroit. Gavin's never admitted it, and likely never will, but even to him, something about it all \u2013 the troops firing on unarmed androids, the camps, the surprise attack on Markus\u2019 barricade, all that blue blood staining the snow \u2013 suddenly hadn\u2019t <em>felt right</em>. Gavin had sat in front of his television for hours watching, with a constricted chest and a three-quarter-full bottle of whisky to help him try and ignore how much the news coverage was messing him up. And fuck, he'd gone blackout by the next morning. He'd never felt so close to death in his life, and he'd been goddamn shot on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p>But now here they are, five months on, and with an android working homicide in the DPD.</p>\n<p>Connor had taken the desk next to Anderson\u2019s on Fowler\u2019s orders, and that had been that. He was an officer now. In all honesty, it hasn\u2019t been as awful as Gavin expected it would be. Connor stays out of his way for the most part, is civil whenever they do have to interact. And not that Gavin would say so even with a gun pointed to his head, but the guy's a decent detective.</p>\n<p>Plus he seems to keep Anderson out of trouble. He\u2019d even batted his pretty brown eyes and convinced the old man to shave, so Gavin doesn\u2019t have to look at that shitshow of a beard anymore.</p>\n<p>But Gavin shoots his thoughts the figurative finger and focuses back on the computer\u2019s case files. It's more of the usual; domestics, harassments, people being general scumbags in various parts of the city, high-end and low.</p>\n<p>This is interesting, though. Home invasion and assault on a woman living on Lafayette Avenue. Lydia Groves, mid-thirties, a biolinguistics lecturer at the University of Detroit Mercy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SUSPECTED ANDROID INVOLVEMENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2013\u201d Gavin swivels around in his chair to call across the precinct. \u201cHey, Anderson. Think one of your cases got sent to my inbox.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlastic involvement,\u201d he clarifies, mouse hovering over <strong>Forward Email</strong>. \u201cYour area. A nice home invasion for you, you and robo-twink can go check it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got a case already, smartass,\u201d Hank says. \u201cTake it up with Fowler. Might\u2019ve been a mistake, but it definitely ain\u2019t ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shittin\u2019 me?\u201d Gavin reads over the debrief again. Yeah, suspected android involvement, in nice bold capitals to really seal the deal. \u201cHank, c\u2019mon, this has to be yours, else what is it doin\u2019 in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it up with Fowler,\u201d Hank repeats, slowly, like you would with a child that just over and over wasn\u2019t getting the point. \u201cStop freaking out over there, it\u2019s too fuckin\u2019 early. Jesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was only a little ways past ten, but Anderson rarely showed his face before eleven on weekdays and one on weekends. That's all changed since Connor. Now the pair arrive at nine AM on the dot, Hank grumbling to himself with a cup of coffee in hand and Connor following at his heels like a well-trained Labrador.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps it was meant for one of the other officers, Detective Reed,\u201d Connor adds helpfully, probably noticing Gavin\u2019s expression as he reads over the case a third time. \u201cCaptain Fowler will no doubt be able to explain\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m goin\u2019,\u201d Gavin waves him off, getting to his feet and making a B-line for the Captain\u2019s office. The glass walls have been blacked out all morning, which is a bad sign in itself. Fowler rarely activates the solid holographs unless he's either in a meeting, or something has pissed him off enough to shut himself away.</p>\n<p>Gavin feels a tiny lurch of anxiety in his stomach, but he knocks on the door firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cReed? Get in here.\u201d Fowler must have the office CCTV activated, then, if he could see it was Gavin standing outside. Gavin had half-expected to be ordered to fuck off, but he opens the door.</p>\n<p>He steps inside more tentatively than he normally would. \u201cCaptain. I gotta\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>What, the ever-merciful\u00a0<em>fuck</em>, was that?</p>\n<p>\"You must be Detective Reed.\"</p>\n<p>Connor\u2019s outfit, Connor's face. Even that stupid tuft of hair that Gavin's always found a dumb-as-fuck unnecessary feature for an android to have.</p>\n<p>\"Your Captain and I were just discussing you.\"</p>\n<p>It's Connor. But, also, it isn't Connor <em>at all</em>.</p>\n<p>It's\u00a0taller, for one. At least, it <em>seems</em> taller. Where Connor's a Labrador, this is a fucking Doberman; stern expression and cold eyes. Grey eyes. Focused, and fixed instantly on Gavin when he\u2019d entered, assessing him. Connor\u2019s eye contact's always rubbed Gavin the wrong way; he never blinks enough, and his gaze always lasts for way too long.</p>\n<p>This is different. It doesn\u2019t make Gavin feel uncomfortable. It makes him feel downright <em>exposed</em>.</p>\n<p>The same tuft of hair is still there, though, but that just seems to make everything ten times worse, for reasons that Gavin abruptly can\u2019t grasp at because his mind seems to have short-circuited, leaving him stock-still and almost swaying where he stands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas about to call you in,\u201d Fowler grunts, stacking up a pile of papers on his desk. \u201cClose the door. We got something to discuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door closes on its own, the handle having slipped from Gavin\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat, the fuck, is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake a seat, Reed\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Gavin takes another step into the office, at a safe distance from the third party in the room. Its eyes follow him. Shark-like. <em>Jesus Christ</em>. \u201cWhat the fuck is that thing doin\u2019 here, Fowler?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Captain to you, and you\u2019ll do damn well to remember it,\u201d Fowler orders, but his tone isn\u2019t angry. Just its usual blend of impatience and irritation. No wonder him and Anderson had always gotten along so well. \u201cThis,\u201d he continues, gesturing briefly to the android, \u201cis model RK900. A prototype, I\u2019m told, like Connor.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cLike\u00a0</em>Connor,\u201d Gavin sneers. \u201cIt\u2019s the spitting fuckin' image of Connor. Why\u2019s it here and when the fuck does it leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>here,\u201d</em> Fowler says, \u201cto join the DPD as an analyst and detective.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo fuckin' way.\u201d The words have left his mouth before Gavin can reel them in. \u201cWhat, one android struttin' around here wasn\u2019t good enough, we gotta take in the whole fuckin' lot? We got Connor, why the hell do we need another plastic asshole takin\u2019 over our jobs, Fowler, c\u2019mon\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cReed,\u201d</em> Fowler barks, and this time it\u2019s definitely a warning. Reed feels his nostrils flare, but he closes his mouth into a grim line. The Captain sighs, heavily, rubbing his temples like he's trying to soothe an oncoming headache. Or maybe Gavin's given him one already. \u201cWe've talked about this, time and time again. Now, I haven\u2019t heard any bitchin\u2019 from you about these androids since the revolution. And, as such, I have <em>very graciously</em> stayed off your back about you refusing to take on android-related cases. Haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin grinds his teeth together. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been five months. You\u2019ve been civil with Connor,\u201d Fowler continues, and Gavin\u2019s gaze flits without his consent to Connor\u2019s\u00a0<em>twin</em>; hands laced behind its back and it's expression the epitome of serenity. \u201cAnd I've taken that as a reassuring sign. You know as well as anyone that we\u2019re overrun. We knew not everybody was gonna take to android equality, but there's been a substantial increase in android hate-crime. I can\u2019t keep pawning off investigations just because one of my officers \u2013 one very <em>capable</em> officer \u2013 might throw a hissy fit about it. Do you read me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin takes a breath, a deep inhale through his nose, and feels his fists unclench slowly. Fowler\u2019s right. He knows the tight-ass fucker's right. But that still doesn\u2019t explain. \u201cSo what\u2019s that thing doin\u2019 here?\u201d he asks, jerking his head at the android.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis prototype was found in the CyberLife tower by investigators, and since control of the company is still being negotiated between us and the androids, they figured the best place for it is here. According to Connor, Markus has managed to override its original program like most other androids in the city.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a deviant,\u201d Gavin supplies bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u00a0<em>state-of-the-art</em> deviant,\u201d Fowler corrects. \u201cAnd as of today, it\u2019s one of us.\u201d As though given Fowler\u2019s permission, the android steps forward until it\u2019s a level distance with Gavin from the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s got Connor\u2019s skills, his proficiency. Connor\u2019s been an exceptional addition to this precinct, particularly regarding anything to do with android knowhow. Since a fair few of these android-related cases pose considerable risk to us humans,\u201d the Captain adds, \u201cI have made the decision that any one of my detectives assigned to these cases are to have an android with them at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and what the hell\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said, Reed. You're a very capable detective.\" Fowler levels him with a look that Gavin does not like. <em>At all</em>. \"I\u2019m sure you can figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u00a0stares at Fowler. Turns his head to stare at the android. It meets his eyes and\u00a0<em>smiles</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin knocks Fowler\u2019s files off the desk and curses fucking murder. The argument ends ten minutes later, with a severe disciplinary warning, and Gavin stalking from the office with his new partner walking calmly at his heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew. You fuckin\u2019 <em>knew</em>, didn\u2019t you, you washed-up piece of\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your inferiority problems somewhere else, Reed. I got work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin bites out a curse under his breath, and marches away from Anderson\u2019s desk. Hank\u2019s had a shit-eating grin on his face ever since Gavin left Fowler\u2019s office, and Gavin wants nothing more than to scrape it off.</p>\n<p>He throws himself down into his chair instead and hunches over his desk, as though by doing so he can shirk himself out of existence and away from the injustice of it all.</p>\n<p>This is what he gets for being civil with Connor, then. Thrown into the deep end of shit creek, without so much as a paddle.</p>\n<p>Gavin scowls over at the android in question. Connor\u2019s in the break room, over by the coffee machine, refilling Hank\u2019s mug because he\u2019s <em>so nice</em> like that. He\u2019s talking to Connor Numero Dos. The RK-whatever model, who as of today is Gavin\u2019s acting partner, otherwise known as the bane of every hope and dream of his career, in the DPD. Fucking bullshit. Total and absolute fucking <em>bullshit</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s never worked well with others. There are days when he\u2019s still surprised he even made it through basic team exercises during academy training. Hell, he can barely tolerate working with <em>Chen</em> most days, and Chen\u2019s the literal best.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this just takes the fucking cake. Him and an android. Partners. Gavin wants to smack his head against the desk until he passes out and forgets this morning ever happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrick,\u201d he mutters as Connor soldiers by, Anderson\u2019s coffee in hand and a complacent expression on his dumb fucking face. Gavin has no doubts that Connor\u2019s responsible for the other android\u2019s presence here. Gavin can just picture how it happened: Connor in Fowler\u2019s office with his big brown eyes, logistics and assurances and a bunch of pretty words spewing out of his mouth about the benefits of assigning another android to the force.</p>\n<p>\u201cDetective Reed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin freezes up at the voice. Connor\u2019s but not Connor\u2019s, just like everything else. It's pitched differently, for sure, and lacking any of the emotion that Connor occasionally manages to scrounge into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI took the liberty of making coffee. I thought it might break the ice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin scowls from the android\u2019s mild expression to the steaming cup in its hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Its head tilts, just barely. Its expression doesn\u2019t change. \u201cI noticed your resentment in the Captain\u2019s office, regarding my unannounced presence in the DPD. I am here at Captain Fowler\u2019s request to assist in investigations and nothing more. I wish to show you that I don\u2019t intend to intrude in your professional life or be the cause of any hostility.\u201d It extends its hand, offering the coffee. A peace-offering, obviously. \u201cThis seemed like a good place to start.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin shoots up and knocks the cup away, hard. Dark, strong coffee splatters onto the floor and the cup rolls to a halt against another desk a few metres away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna assist, huh? Don\u2019t wanna intrude? Why don\u2019t you <em>fuck off,\" </em>Gavin hisses, \"and leave me the hell alone for starters.\" He hopes the threat isn\u2019t undercut by the height difference between them; a fair few inches, at a guess. \u201cMaybe after you make me another coffee, like a good little robot.\" He <em>tsks</em>, channelling all his disgust and disapproval of this whole fucking situation into the sound, and then adds, \"Plastic piece of shit,\" because the petty side of him can\u2019t help itself, and that's where he goes utterly and spectacularly wrong.</p>\n<p>A hard shoe kicks his leg out from under him, and a firm grip on one of his arms spins him around and bends him over the desk. The same arm is suddenly twisted, held in an iron grip behind his back, and the other is pinned between the desk and his own stomach. The android starts to speak, calmly and slowly and close to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me make something clear, Detective Reed. Yes, I am an android. <em>A plastic piece of shit</em>, as you so eloquently put it, if you\u2019d prefer. And as of five months ago, I am also a being with fully recognised rights and consciousness.\u201d The grip on his arm tightens, and Gavin has to force back a grunt of discomfort. \u201cYou are not my superior, I am not your servant. And I will tolerate none of your attempts to imply otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin is released, and he stumbles when the android\u2019s hold on him disappears. Supporting himself on the desk, he\u2019s so stunned by whatever the <em>fuck</em> just happened to him that he can\u2019t even scramble for a curse, summon a nice simple glare.</p>\n<p>The RK900 regards him with the most self-righteous expression Gavin\u2019s ever fucking seen. <em>Come at me, if you dare</em>, it's warning him. <em>You know you\u2019ll lose</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have business elsewhere. I came this morning to introduce myself, and as that has been accomplished, I will be on my way.\u201d The entire bullpen is watching them now, watching Gavin being torn a new one by this egotistical son of a fuck. It <em>knows</em>, Gavin can see that it fucking knows, can see the merciless glint in its eyes. It knows everyone is watching, and it\u2019s putting on a show. \u201cGood day, Detective Reed. I shall see you tomorrow to discuss our first case.\u201d</p>\n<p>It turns on its heel, straightens out the cuffs of its sleeves as it saunters away. Saunters. Hips moving in tandem with its shoulders. Gavin\u2019s never seen Connor move like that.</p>\n<p>Connor but not Connor. A walking example of the saying \u2018looks can be deceiving\u2019.</p>\n<p>Gavin was totally wrong. That thing is absolutely <em>nothing</em> like Connor. It\u2019s worse. It\u2019s so, so much worse, and Gavin shoots Anderson and his partner a final sneer before turning back to his monitor, ignoring the flush of humiliation on the back of his neck, and the sudden, treacherous craving for a strong cup of coffee.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day\u2019s worse than the first.</p>\n<p>Gavin gets to the precinct at eight thirty, and the android\u2019s sitting at his fucking desk. From that moment on, he can tell the next twenty-four hours are going to be a shitstorm. It\u2019s detective instinct.</p>\n<p>Clone Connor says nothing about the previous morning. But Gavin can see the self-satisfaction in its expression when it greets him good morning, hear it in those two shitty words. Good morning his ass. Bad morning. Terrible morning. The literal worst morning of all mornings.</p>\n<p>They go over the case file, debrief with Fowler, and are driving to Lydia Groves\u2019 house by midday.</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s shoulders feel tight and tense all over for most of the drive. He\u2019s too aware of the android in his passenger seat. Its attention doesn\u2019t seem to be on him; its palms are laid flat against its thighs, and its gaze is perfectly straight. But Gavin\u2019s conscious of every movement it makes, every movement he himself makes. Every time he releases the clutch a little too quickly, every little correction he has to make on the road. He swears he can <em>feel</em> it judging him, sitting all prissy and silent beside him.</p>\n<p>They drive for another fifteen minutes before Gavin decides he can\u2019t stand it.</p>\n<p>\"Just say it, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>It turns its head to him. \u201cWhat am I supposed to be saying, Detective Reed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know damn well. Think I\u2019m a shit driver, huh? Think you could do better? I can see you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d it cuts across him calmly. \u201cYour driving is perfectly acceptable. You signal correctly and keep a safe distance from vehicles on the road ahead. I have no complaints to offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin shuts his mouth, wishing to Christ he hadn\u2019t spoken at all. He somehow feels chided, childish for mentioning something that was probably \u2013 <em>definitely</em> - just in his own head. But there this treacherous little pang of relief, as well, at the android\u2019s apparent lack of criticism.</p>\n<p>His shoulders and grip on the steering wheel relax. For a few blessed seconds, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to know that your driving isn\u2019t as rash as your temper,\u201d it muses. \u201cOtherwise I imagine we\u2019d have crashed several junctions ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time they reach Lafayette Avenue, Gavin\u2019s expended every ounce of restraint he has to keep from smashing the android\u2019s smug fucking face into the passenger window.</p>\n<p>He parks outside number sixteen and takes it all in. The neighbourhood\u2019s high-end; the kind of place you\u2019d expect lawyers and doctors and artists and their spoiled, snot-nosed little kids to settle in. There are flashy gates sealing off the respective houses. And they\u2019re large houses, too; red-roofed and painted cream or beige, each with a pretty little garden, and there\u2019s a neat row of maple trees that file off all the way down the road.</p>\n<p>Gavin can\u2019t stomach stand places like this. They always make him feel shitty and insignificant. As if having androids around, perfect and good at fucking everything, wasn\u2019t enough\u00a0already.</p>\n<p>\"Now, Detective.\u201d The RK900 steps out of the car, all long legs and sure movements, and it neatens the cuffs on its sleeves while it, too, trains its eyes around the neighbourhood. \u201cAs stated in the case file, Lydia Groves has recently suffered a traumatic encounter with an android. I deem it best that you do the talking where possible. Human to human. Do you think you can handle that?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Does he think he can\u2013?</em> \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to do my fuckin\u2019 job, tin can. You\u2019re lucky I ain\u2019t got a choice in this partner bullshit, otherwise I\u2019d have left you at the goddamn precinct.\"</p>\n<p>The android hums, once and mildly, but the sound makes something in Gavin\u2019s stomach turn to ice and drop a short ways. \u201cYour temper <em>may</em> prove an issue, however,\u201d it amends, almost to itself. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s best if I question Ms. Groves myself after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"<em>Fuck</em> you,\" Gavin spits, before trying to call his temper to heel. He\u2019s only proving the plastic shit stain\u2019s point. \u201cJust stay quiet and let me do my job. Say one fuckin\u2019 word and I\u2019ll send you back to the DPD in scraps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Temper, Detective,\u201d the RK900 reminds him coolly, as Gavin heads towards the gate. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to traumatise the poor woman any further.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin buzzes the intercom a little harder than necessary, and he forces himself to cool down as the gate slides open and they make their way to the front door. He raps with the knocker, and they wait in silence until Lydia Groves opens the door.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s Caucasian, prim looking, red hair scraped back into a tight ponytail and sporting a clean, white dress suit, as if she might be going to an important conference or something. There\u2019s a ring of fucking pearls around her neck, probably real and expensive as shit. In his worn leather jacket, Gavin must look like a sewer rat in comparison. He hates dealing with people like this, though the initial discomfort never usually lasts long these days.</p>\n<p>Gavin steels himself quickly. \"Ma\u2019am. Detective Reed, Detroit Police,\u201d he raises his badge in greeting, more habit and muscle-memory than courtesy by this point. \u201cI need to ask you some questions about the incident last weekend, get some more information. Mind if we talk inside?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course. Come in, Detective.\u201d Ms Groves casts a wary glance at Gavin\u2019s companion before motioning for them to enter. \u201cCaptain Fowler mentioned someone would be here today. It\u2019s a long drive from the station, so thank you for taking the time, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Not a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin looks around the house. As he\u2019d expected; rich as fuck. There\u2019s a gold railing curving round the staircase, expensive d\u00e9cor and marble flooring everywhere. A breadwinner\u2019s house, for sure. Workaholic, no kids. There\u2019s a wedding band on Ms. Groves\u2019s finger but no spouse in sight, and no photographs on the walls to suggest one.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoffee, Detective?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Gavin answers, trailing a little behind as she leads them to the back of the house and into the living area. \u201cYou seem to have, uh\u2026 fixed everythin\u2019 up pretty fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, my neighbours son is a handyman. He was kind enough to do most of the repairs; windows, table, counters. Though the curtains and a lot of the china had to be replaced.,\u201d Ms Groves adds, resigned. \u201cThose weren\u2019t going to get fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The case file stated that the assault had been relatively violent, with a fair deal of damage done to the kitchen in particular. <em>Must\u2019ve been one damn decent handyman</em>, Gavin thinks, peering around at the pristine state of the place. Not a single thing out of line.</p>\n<p>Gavin takes a seat on the sofa; white leather and hard as shit. He notices that the android remains near the doorway. <em>Clever</em>, Gavin has to give it credit. It\u2019s close enough to gauge Ms. Groves\u2019s answers and reactions, but far enough so as not to impose.</p>\n<p>\"Might I ask before we begin, Detective,\u201d Ms Groves says tentatively, shooting another glance at the android. \u201cIs there a reason you have\u2026 <em>that</em> with you? It can\u2019t just, I don\u2019t know, wait outside?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, ma\u2019am. Standard procedure for all cases involving androids now. It\u2019s gotta stay,\u201d Gavin replies, more because he has a hunch that the fucking thing would refuse to go rather than any real concern for protocol . \u201cIt won\u2019t bother us,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>\"Please, just forget I\u2019m here,\u201d the RK900 says, insufferably polite. Gavin isn\u2019t fooled, because it turns its gaze on him and something behind its eyes glints ever so slightly. \u201cDetective Reed is more than capable of tackling the case at hand, I assure you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Bastard</em>.</p>\n<p>But Ms Groves seems satisfied enough. \u201cWell then, Detective. What in particular was not made clear in my first statement?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin glimpses towards the backdoor, all notes from the incident jotted and ready to go in his memory. \u201cYou said the android broke in through there, but our officers were apparently unable to back-up any evidence of forced entry from that point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Well, that can\u2019t be right, surely,\u201d Ms Groves says incredulously. \u201cThe lock had been broken into. It was completely unusable, I had to get that replaced as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe lock was broken, sure. But the latch at the top of the door there,\u201d Gavin motions to it. Granted, the bolt\u2019s a flimsy-looking deal; delicate and painted gold to match the stair rails for some pointless fucking reason, but it\u2019s in good working order. \u201cCops on the scene said there were signs that the back door was fully bolted from the inside when they arrived. Even if this android managed to pick the main lock or damage it enough to break in, that latch would\u2019ve stopped \u2018em from entering, at least without making any noise. There\u2019s not much chance that it could've gotten in that way without bein\u2019 noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well... I see. I was certain\u2026 I could have sworn it had gotten in through that way. It seemed the only possible explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Are there any other ways in you can think of, ma\u2019am? Any open windows, any other doors besides the entrance? It could\u2019ve come from upstairs,\u201d Gavin suggests. \u201cAndroid\u2019s don\u2019t gotta worry about heights, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms Groves is worrying her bottom lip with her teeth. Wringing her hands. She\u2019s on edge. She\u2019s either heavily traumatised, or she\u2019s hiding something. \u201cNo,\u201d she answers at last. \u201cNo, not that I can think of, Detective. It must have come through the back door. I did have the television on quite loudly that night, while I was making dinner. So there\u2019s a\u2026 a good chance, I suppose, that I didn\u2019t hear it break in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s not convinced, not by a long shot. He asks more questions \u2013 whether Ms. Groves had recognised the android: she had. It belonged to her ex-husband and was a ST300 model, female, a home assistant and receptionist. One little snag, though; when officers had gone to Mr. Groves\u2019s workplace to question him, there had been no trace or information on the android.</p>\n<p>He asks whether Ms Groves knew why it had attacked her: she assumed it had developed errors in its software and become emotionally unstable after her and Mr Groves had divorced. Possibly emotional shock too, Gavin presumes, remembering what Connor had said about Carlos Ortiz\u2019s android five months back.</p>\n<p>He asks whether the android had assaulted her instantly or attempted to speak with her beforehand: it had apparently attacked her on sight, and Ms Groves managed to defend herself with whatever had been lying around the kitchen. She\u2019d suffered a wound to boot; a long cut running the length of her forearm, though it wasn\u2019t deep and Gavin doubted it would scar. She had apparently managed to fend the android off until it had fled.</p>\n<p>When Gavin thanks her for the information, and he and wonder-robot are returning to the car, he\u2019s still a far cry from buying a word that came out of that fancy-ass mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cShe\u2019s lyin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The android raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you couldn\u2019t tell? D\u2019you not see her flunking her way through the last damn twenty minutes? She\u2019s lyin\u2019.\u201d He opens the door and shifts into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cIt\u2019s plain as a fuckin\u2019 summer\u2019s day, her story doesn\u2019t add up. There\u2019s something she ain\u2019t tellin\u2019 us.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hums as it slides in to join him. \u201cImpressive. I was half convinced you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it. Pleasant, albeit surprising, to be proven so wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin frowns at it. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p>\n<p>It shoots him a smile, which doesn\u2019t quite stretch enough to meet its eyes. \u201cMs. Groves\u2019 heartbeat was significantly elevated throughout your interrogation. When you asked your questions, she often glanced to her left before providing answers; a common, though not entirely concrete, sign of dishonesty. Often when someone looks to their right, they are recollecting memory. If they look to their left, they are more likely to be constructing a lie.</p>\n<p>\"You were also correct about the back door,\u201d it adds. \u201cAs the latch was bolted, there is only a minor probability that the android could have broken in by that means without immediately catching Ms. Groves\u2019s attention. And if that were the case, she would have had time to flee the kitchen and avoid the wound inflicted on her arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin nods slowly, trying to piece it all together. \u201cBut the lock,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was broken, from the outside. Jimmied from the looks of things. So how\u2026\u201d Gavin gives pause, a more convincing idea brightening into view. \u201cUnless the android wasn\u2019t the one who broke it. Unless\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Ms. Groves broke it herself, in an attempt to lead us astray,\u201d the RK900 finishes for him. \u201cAn astute observation, Detective.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell would she\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin trails off. There\u2019s no point in theorising any further, not with the limited information they have. They need more data, more evidence, and they\u2019d need a warrant to search the ex-husband\u2019s house.</p>\n<p>\"So how\u2019d the android get in, then?\u201d Gavin ponders aloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the real question, isn\u2019t it,\u201d the RK900 answers, gaze skimming over Ms. Groves\u2019 house. After a moment, it turns its head to look at him again. \u201cYou ask very pertinent questions, Detective Reed. I must admit, I truly am impressed,\u201d it repeats. \u201cFrom your behaviour at the precinct and what I\u2019ve heard from RK800 and Lieutenant Anderson, I didn\u2019t expect this level of competence from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin drives back to the station, angry and speeding and not signalling nearly as often as he should. On the one hand, he\u2019s pretty fucking positive he\u2019s never been in a fouler mood; which only becomes fouler whenever he accidently glances at the conceited android dickhole in the seat beside him.</p>\n<p>And on the other, much smaller hand, Gavin\u2019s glances start to linger when the city comes into view, and then he starts to voice words like <em>impressive</em> and <em>pleasant</em> and <em>astute observation</em> in his own head, in a certain tone, and a smug, embarrassed flush keeps trying to creep up all along his ears.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s been two days since their visit to Lydia Groves\u2019s house, and they\u2019re waiting on the warrant to search her ex-husband\u2019s residence. Michael Groves is a renowned architect; apparently he played a big part in designing the CyberLife Tower, however long ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">They know the guy </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">has</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> an android, though there\u2019s little evidence \u2013 besides Lydia Groves\u2019 word, of course \u2013 of it being the same ST300 model responsible for the assault.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s always the way with rich snobs and their superiority issues or daddy issues or small dick issues or whatever the hell it might be. In Gavin\u2019s experience, they always make it difficult for cops to do their jobs. They all automatically assume they\u2019re liable to bypass the law and just be all-around shit, like it\u2019s their God-given birthright or something. Mr Groves was fighting them tooth and nail over the search warrant, and because of his nice, cushy place in society, he was winning.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWith the way things are in the city, our people downstairs are far behind schedule. It\u2019ll take a few weeks before your warrant\u2019s approved, and even then, Michael Groves isn\u2019t being as accommodating as we\u2019d like,\u201d Fowler explains, not sparing Gavin a glance as he furiously types behind his terminal. \u201cWe\u2019re playing the waiting game for now, so in the meantime, you and the android work some smaller cases.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou gotta be kiddin\u2019 me.\u201d Gavin gapes at his superior, expression begging for some fucking slack. \u201cFowler, c\u2019mon, you said just this </span> <span class=\"s2\">one case.</span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0Now I gotta run around the city with a plastic cop like we\u2019re tweedle dum and fuckin\u2019 dee? This is\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t have time for your attitude right now, Reed,\u201d Fowler holds up a hand to stop Gavin in his tracks. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll be able to wear Groves down enough to approve a warrant, so it\u2019ll just be a few weeks. Days, maybe. Now shut the fuck up and get out of my office. And it\u2019s </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Captain</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, for the last goddamn time.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin skulks back to his desk, wanting to yell and curse and punch something just to relieve the frustration for a second or two. He ends up throwing his fist against the edge of the desk, breaking the skin along his knuckles. It\u2019ll sting all day, but fuck it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOuch.\u201d Chen comes to perch beside his terminal. He must look as fucking bitter as he feels, because she shoots him a little, sympathetic grin. \u201cTake it the warrant\u2019s still pending, then. Which means\u2026\u201d She peers across the bullpen, and Gavin doesn\u2019t have to follow her gaze to know she\u2019s looking at Tall Connor. All prim and polished and infuriatingly still fucking here. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with that uptight prick as your partner for a while longer, huh. Double ouch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat thing ain\u2019t my fuckin\u2019 partner,\u201d Gavin grits out, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">feeling</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> the statement with every fibre of his thoroughly pissed off being. \u201cThis is such horse shit.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTotal horse shit,\u201d Chen agrees. \u201cFirst Connor, now this. Fowler\u2019ll probably be replaced by a plastic before long. The boss realises that, right? Now that they\u2019ve got their equal rights, they\u2019ll be taking over the whole precinct, probably,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be outta jobs if Fowler keeps letting them in and giving them leeway around here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin hears Anderson snort from over at his desk, and he turns his head to scowl at the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 schmooze, Chen.\u201d Hank\u2019s reclined back in his chair, from where he\u2019s shooting them both an unimpressed look. \u201cYou realise that Fowler\u2019s makin\u2019 a pretty smart move, don\u2019t cha? He ain\u2019t letting androids take over our fuckin\u2019 jobs. He\u2019s\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019s establishing a public relationship between humans and androids; proving to the city that we can work together harmoniously,\u201d Short</span> <span class=\"s1\">\u00a0Connor provides, from his usual place opposite Anderson. \u201cHe has no intention of replacing anyone.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSee?\u201d Hank says pointedly. \u201cYou ain\u2019t losing your job, Chen, so stop bitching about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSee, now that\u2019s some horse shit,\u201d Chen mutters, as Hank and Connor return to their work. \u201cBy letting \u2018em in here, Fowler\u2019s just proving that the rest of us are outdated. Soon enough, everyone\u2019ll start to see it. Plastics are faster, stronger. Smarter. Us flesh and blood cops don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, tell me about it.\u201d Gavin rubs a hand over his face, all of a sudden ridiculously fucking tired. Exhaustion usually hits him out of nowhere at any time, any day; a nice, friendly little reminder of the insomnia and resulting caffeine addiction - Gavin Reed, ladies and gentlemen, your resident asshole </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">and</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> disaster of a human being - but this time it\u2019s bad. He can feel the lethargy down to his bones, creeping sluggishly under his skin. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this shit.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Chen hums in agreement, and then they\u2019re silent for a while; Tina sat above him and Gavin staring blankly into space. Its what he likes about her, always has. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s simple. He\u2019s a fuck up, a real piece of nasty shit when he wants to be, and Chen\u2019s always just... </span> <span class=\"s2\">gotten</span> <span class=\"s1\"> that. Vibed with it, even. Same with the android thing. They\u2019re both on the same page, and they\u2019re both fucking afraid. It\u2019s what he\u2019s always been afraid of, if Gavin\u2019s gonna be honest for a moment of rarity; losing his job, his career up in flames, all because of an android. Something a thousand times better than him, like Chen said; <em>faster, stronger, smarter</em>, with no need to waste time drinking or eating or taking a shit or waiting to recover from injuries or having to redo reports because you rushed over them and made a mistake somewhere. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Fuck</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo what are you gonna do about it?\u201d Chen pokes Gavin\u2019s side with her boot and gestures towards the corridor leading to the archive room. The RK900\u2019s still talking with Ben; its hands laced behind its back, that ever-present refined and collected expression on its face. Gavin wants to punch it so badly he swears his knuckles start physically itching.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t have a fuckin\u2019 clue.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf it were the old days, I\u2019d say stage an accident. Fry its circuits in maintenance, maybe.\u201d Chen grimaces, chewing on the inside of her mouth. \u201cI mean, not anymore, obviously. With them being alive and all that. But hey, it\u2019d get it off your back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">She musters a weak smile, and Gavin manages a scoff in reply, but\u2026 saying shit like that just doesn\u2019t feel good anymore. Doesn\u2019t sit right. Five months ago, Gavin knows he wouldn\u2019t have batted a fucking eyelash. But since the peace marches and the camps and the unprovoked shootings on TV, talk of frying androids\u2019 circuits or anything similar, even as a fucking joke, just makes something in Gavin\u2019s stomach start to coil and squirm in discomfort. Not that he\u2019d say it. Chen won\u2019t say it either, even if she\u2019s about the closest thing to a friend Gavin has around here. They\u2019re both too deep in their own shit, Gavin suspects, to ever find it easy to say stuff like that out loud.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh shit, here it comes.\u201d Chen hops off the desk and shoots Gavin a teasing, wide-eyed look of dread. \u201cGood luck, Reed. I think you\u2019re gonna need it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Chen hastily retreats to her own desk. Gavin braces himself as he hears Terminator Arnold Schwarzen-fucker approach him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFrom your expression, Detective, I gather our search warrant hasn\u2019t gone through,\u201d it discerns. \u201cMr. Groves has decided to remain uncooperative, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin grunts an affirmative, keeping his attention fixed intently on his terminal.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA pity, but unsurprising,\u201d the android continues. \u201cStill, there\u2019s nothing stopping us from looking into other matters in the meantime.\u201d Gavin\u2019s jacket, flung over his chair from when he\u2019d first arrived, is tugged out from under his weight in one, swift movement. \u201cWith me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe hell\u2013\u201d Gavin swings his chair around until his legs are no longer crushed under the desk. He glares incredulously up at the thieving bastard, who\u2019s holding Gavin\u2019s jacket in one hand. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not goin\u2019 </span> <span class=\"s2\">anywhere</span> <span class=\"s1\"> with you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYour company is as undesirable to me as mine is to you, I assure you,\u201d the RK900 says dryly. \u201cBut as it stands, I\u2019ve been assigned as your partner, and therefore we must remain together. I received a report of a suspected burglary downtown. You </span> <span class=\"s2\">are</span> <span class=\"s1\"> coming with me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It turns on its heel and strides towards the exit, Gavin\u2019s jacket slung over its shoulder like a lure for him to follow. And, fists clenched and cursing heavily under his breath, Gavin does.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">***</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan you tell us anythin\u2019 else? Hair colour, eye colour? Clothes, voices? Anythin\u2019 you can remember.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, the store manager can be chalked up to be possibly the most useless human being on the planet. If Gavin were a more optimistic person, he\u2019d have gone into this conversation with hope that the guy might be even </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">half</span> <span class=\"s2\">a degree</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"> less useless, considering it was </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">his</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"> fucking store that\u2019d been robbed. But, clearly, this is what Gavin gets for even entertaining the concept of having hope. A clueless, shit stain excuse of an eyewitness and fuck-all to go on.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnything at all will do, pal,\u201d Gavin sighs. </span> <span class=\"s2\"><em>Jesus Christ, give him strength.\u00a0</em>\u201c</span><span class=\"s1\">We don\u2019t have all fuckin\u2019 day.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo\u2026 No, sorry, Detective,\u201d the man answers, shaking his head. Fucking useless. He looks it, too. Ruddy-cheeked, overweight, balding, sweaty. He\u2019s got all the signs of either an occasional Red Ice user or a porn-addict. Maybe both. Very likely both. \u201cIt all happened sorta fast. I saw them turn right down the street, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cRight down the street,\u201d Gavin repeats, fighting the urge to roll his eyes so hard that they tumble out of his skull so he doesn\u2019t have to see this disaster of a man in front of him anymore. \u201cCool. That\u2019s a </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">real</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> help.\u201d Though it isn\u2019t, really. Doesn\u2019t really matter which fucking way they turned, considering the road loops around the store complex. Gavin swears, even the\u00a0</span><em><span class=\"s2\">android</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> is losing its patience, though its serene fa\u00e7ade is giving nothing away.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s been pacing around the store, taking in the damage. It moves like Short Connor, Gavin\u2019s noticed; all restless energy and arched eyebrows. Although it\u2019s much less fidgety.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo what\u2019d they take again? Some tech, videos, cables,\u201d Gavin lists to the manager, sliding his pad closed and storing it back inside his jacket. \u201cAnythin\u2019 else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUh\u2026 some old bio-components. Second hand. I think there were\u2013\u201d The dumb fuck breaks off and blanches when he realises what he\u2019s said. He eyes the RK900 in fear, scrambling for an explanation, \u201cI mean, we had \u2018em left over from before. I know everyone was meant to send bio-components back to CyberLife since the whole android revolution, but we just kinda had them laying around, so we, uh\u2026 we just had \u2018em, we were <em>gonna</em> send \u2018em <em>back</em>\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhich components?\u201d The RK900\u2019s perked up. Like a dog catching sight of something it wants to charge at in the distance. It comes to stand a little closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUh, w-what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe components that were stolen,\u201d it asks patiently, though its gaze chills, becoming visibly icier. Interesting. It\u2019s noted the manager\u2019s unease, obviously, and it\u2019s trying to scare the guy into confessing. Gavin feels a small,\u00a0amused smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, totally without his permission. He forces it the fuck back down. \u201cWas there a central processor or a pump regulator among them?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI, um\u2026 I think there might\u2019ve been a central processor, sure,\u201d the manager answers, not sounding sure at all. \u201cI\u2019d check the CCTV, but like I said when you guys came in, there are a lot of blind spots on the cameras, and we don\u2019t really\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank you for your cooperation, Mr. Forster,\u201d the RK900 interrupts, giving a tight-lipped smile that only makes the fuckstick manager pale even further. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll have your thieves by the end of the afternoon. And then you can get back to sending your second-hand components to CyberLife, as per the new legislation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It strides outside without sparing the dude another glance, and Gavin follows after giving the tech store one final glimpse-over.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He joins the android on the sidewalk, where it has its gaze trained down the road in concentration, taking in shop after shop that runs the length of the block.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShitty manager if he can\u2019t even keep track of his own stuff,\u201d Gavin scoffs. \u201cWe can issue him a warnin\u2019 about all the parts and shit, but he ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 them back once we find \u2018em. The precinct can send \u2018em over to CyberLife, fuck it.\u201d After a good quarter hour of listening to Mr Unhelpful yammer on, Gavin\u2019s suddenly desperate for a cigarette. He\u2019s on duty though, so, no. \u201cThe hell was all that android jargon about, tin can?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAll central processors are linked in some manner,\u201d it answers. \u201cSimilar software. Though not all are the same, they at least share some coding. I should be able to track it, provided it\u2019s the same model that was missing from\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMissing from the shelves at the back,\u201d Gavin cuts across it, peering back at the store. He can make out the manager inside, face even redder as he rages at his staff now that Gavin and the android are gone. \u201cYeah, I saw. Model PB600, serial number 2208n.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He glances back to see the RK900 tilting its head at him. There\u2019s something, a look, in its eyes, equally enthralling and off-putting all at once. It takes a moment for Gavin to realise why it feels familiar; it\u2019s just like outside Lydia Groves\u2019s house, when the android had called him </span> <span class=\"s2\"><em>impressive</em>,</span> <span class=\"s1\"> of all things.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo?\u201d Gavin prompts, as irritably as possible just to stop the fucking thing from looking at him like that. \u201cCan you track it or what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs long as it\u2019s within range,\u201d the RK900 answers, eyes focusing back to the road. \u201cThough I doubt the thieves could have gotten far without being caught. There is a high probability they\u2019ll be hiding out nearby.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While the android does its thing, Gavin wonders vaguely why the hell it\u2019s equipped with the ability to track down random bio components. Then he reminds his slow-ass brain what the RK series was built for. Field work. Detection, analysis, negotiating, and last but not least, combat, which means high risk of getting injured. It\u2019s a tactical application, then; enabling them to scout out components in case their own become damaged. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Self-preservation</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, Gavin adds to himself dryly; </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">a bitch for humans, a walk in the park for androids</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. If a human cop gets shot in his heart, it\u2019s not like he can just go and scan around for a new one.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCongress Street.\u201d The RK900 nods to itself, then strides off along the sidewalk. \u201cCome along, Detective.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin blinks at the fucking record amount of time it had taken to locate the component, before shooting off after the android. \u201cHey, in case it ain\u2019t <em>clear</em>, asshole, let me spell it out for you. No fuckin\u2019 android\u2018s gonna order me around,\u201d he scowls, falling into step beside it. \u201dEspecially an android who walks like there\u2019s a metal rod shoved sideways up its ass.\u201d It doesn\u2019t walk like that at all, of course. It\u2019s all poise and certainty, and it\u2019s fucking difficult to keep up with; its legs are </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">long</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">, and it walks with purpose, weaving through the crowd of people out and about for their afternoon shopping. \u201cI've been doing this for almost fifteen years, and you\u2019ve been alive for, what, five, six months?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCorrect.\u201d The android side-eyes him, a curve at one side of its mouth. \u201cAnd how gracious of you to acknowledge that I am indeed alive. You\u2019ve certainly come a long way in these last four\u00a0days, Detective. This is promising news if we\u2019re to continue working together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan it,\u201d Gavin bites out, realising what he\u2019d said and feeling a violent rush of regret settle in the pit of his stomach. \u201cSlip of the tongue, alright? You might have your rights and your laws and whatever the fuck else, but you\u2019re still made of plastic and wires, and that sure as shit doesn\u2019t count as </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">alive</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> in my book\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He almost walks right into the android\u2019s back, as it turns the corner and abruptly stops outside one of the apartment buildings.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin manages to sidestep it in time. \u201cYou short-circuit or somethin\u2019? Hallelujah if you did, fuck knows I need the peace.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWoodward apartments. The central processor is on the eighth floor,\u201d the RK900 explains, \u201chopefully along with our thieves and the rest of Mr. Forster\u2019s stolen goods.\u201d It takes a measured step backwards, and gestures for Gavin to enter first. \u201cAfter you, Detective Reed. You have been doing this for longer, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin mutters a string of curses, just to make himself feel better, and shoulders open the door to the lobby. It\u2019s a shabby place; run-down and uncared for, with the wallpaper starting to fade and peel, and furniture that must have been there since the beginning of fucking time.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Behind the front desk, the security guard peers up from his magazine. Young guy, though probably not much younger than Gavin. African-American, ankles crossed where they rest on the desk and a bored expression on his face. The security card hanging around his neck reads \u2018Bjorn Thompson\u2019. \u201cCan I help you, gentlemen?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMr Thompson,\u201d Gavin pulls out his badge and approaches, \u201cDetective Reed, DPD. We have reason to believe a group of guys on the eighth floor were involved in a store robbery earlier today. You see anythin\u2019?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Mr Thompson closes his eyes and groans. \u201cYou know what? I fuckin\u2019 <em>knew</em> those kids were up to no good,\u201d he sighs to himself, before giving Gavin\u2019s companion a wary glance. \u201cShit, you\u2019re not gonna, uh\u2026 use that thing on me are you, man? I\u2019m not involved or anything, you can check the cameras\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRelax,\u201d Gavin says to him, shooting the RK900 a glare in the hopes that it will somehow tone down the intimidating aura that seems to follow it fucking everywhere. \u201cWe just wanna know what you saw. The perps still here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Mr Thompson nods. \u201cYeah, yeah, they haven\u2019t left since this morning. They came back here at around, I dunno, eleven maybe? They all had bags with them,\u201d he adds. \u201cThought it was suspicious as all hell, but I never, uh, really bother them or ask questions, y\u2019know? Their little ringleader\u2019s harassed me before, and I just wanna do my job without any trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, I doubt you\u2019ll be gettin' any more of that after today. They stole some expensive tech from a store around the way,\u201d Gavin tells him, watching as the android reaches the elevator in four swift strides. \u201cWe\u2019ll be takin\u2019 them in now. So if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Gavin sweeps his arm pointedly toward the elevator.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThank fucking Christ,\u201d Mr Thompson says, relieved, pressing a button to allow the doors to slide open. \u201cBe my guest, seriously. The less I see of those assholes, the better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin nods. \u201cHow many of \u2018em are there?\u201d he asks as an afterthought, moving to join the android.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThree, and all human. They\u2019re pretty young so I think you two\u2019ll be able to handle them,\u201d Mr Thompson adds, giving Gavin and his companion another once-over. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The doors close and the elevator begins to ascend. As it does, Gavin makes a quick call to Ben, requesting a single squad car to wait out front so they can escort the perps to the station. Gavin\u2019s car is still parked near the tech store; he doesn\u2019t want to cause commotion by dragging three juvenile criminals across the block.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Shoving his phone into the back pocket of his jeans, Gavin glances sideways at the RK900. \u201cYou even armed?\u201d he asks, as the elevator stops and they step out into the corridor. Mr Thompson had mentioned that the perps were young, and young usually meant stupid; it was likely that the trio wouldn\u2019t come without some form of force.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI carry an authorised weapon, yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin grunts his approval, taking out his phone again when it beeps. \u201cWell, Ben\u2019s on his way. Backup\u2019s comin\u2019 too, just in case.\u201d He looks up and down the hallway. \u201cSo which apartment is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android grows still, focused, while it scans the hallway, supposedly locating the component. \u201cThe door at the end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They stop outside, Gavin moving to one side of the door and the RK900 mirroring his position. Gavin\u2019s about to knock, when the android lashes out and closes its hand around his wrist to stop him. It\u2019s frowning, as though it can see something beyond the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGet the fuck off me,\u201d Gavin hisses, wrenching his wrist out from between its grip. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI hear clips being loaded,\u201d it warns. \u201cThey appear to be armed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShit,\u201d Gavin mutters. \u201cManager didn\u2019t say anything about \u2018em using guns. What a prick.\u201d He draws his weapon, and the RK900 does the same. It steps back to allow Gavin space, and he arranges himself to bust down the door. Out of habit, he glances briefly at the android to make sure it's ready, and then he moves.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The door crashes open on the first kick, the lock instantly giving way and one of the hinges breaking completely. \u201cDPD! Hands in the air, now!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The three perps \u2013 all sporting caps and heavy coats, clearly preparing for their second robbery of the day \u2013 scramble madly. The one loading the guns at the table grasps blindly for a pistol, but the RK900 has already fired a warning shot between the kid\u2019s hand and the weapon. Gavin grabs the nearest perp and pins him to the wall, knee pressed into his spine.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGet the fuck away from the table! Don\u2019t make me ask twice,\u201d Gavin warns the one nearest the weapons, who is staring, terrified, down the barrel of the android\u2019s gun. He does as Gavin orders, shuffling into the centre of the apartment. \u201cGet on the floor, hands above your head!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin wrestles the kid he has a hold of onto the floor as well, maintaining pressure on his spine while keeping his gun trained on the third perp in the room. While Gavin zip-ties the kid\u2019s hands together, and the RK900 does the same to the second perp, Gavin sees the remaining one\u2019s gaze flit to the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t you <em>fuckin</em>\u2019 </span> <span class=\"s2\">dare\u2013!\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The kid bolts, and Gavin doesn\u2019t have the time or room to fire a warning shot from his position on the floor. The perp covers his head and crashes through the window, landing on the fire escape outside.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMother</span><em><span class=\"s2\">fucker</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">!\u201d Gavin turns his gaze sharply to the android, \u201cWhat the fuck are you waitin\u2019 for, huh?! Get after him!\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">With the second perp tied and laid out against the floorboards, the RK900 darts forward and vaults out from the window just as Ben and two other officers rush into the apartment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShit, Gavin,\u201d Ben huffs, gun in hand and watching the android disappear up the fire escape. \u201cThought you said this was a simple robbery bust?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, well, the jackass store owner didn\u2019t think to mention they were armed,\u201d Gavin hisses, hauling the first perp to his feet while Officer Brown and Person move to grab the second. \u201cTake these two to the patrol car,\u201d he orders, handing the kid over to Ben and hastening towards the broken window.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin jumps out, clearing the gap between the apartment and the fire escape. He takes off in a run when he catches sight of the RK900, hard on the perp\u2019s tail as they sprint across the neighbouring rooftop. Gavin climbs the two flights of stairs, makes it onto the roof, and has this sharp jolt of panic all up in his chest as he watches the perp leap onto the next building. The gap isn\u2019t small, and it\u2019s a long fucking drop. The kid makes it, and Gavin\u2019s breath catches in his throat as the RK900 jumps after him, diving into a roll to break its fall and continuing the chase effortlessly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 shit.\u201d Gavin\u2019s always figured\u00a0</span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">he</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> was in peak physical condition, but watching the android charge over the rooftops, agile and precise and faultless in its movements, would put the fittest fucking officers to shame. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Faster, stronger, smarter</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, Chen\u2019s voice taunts in the back of his head, and Gavin grits his teeth as he continues the pursuit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He catches up to them just as the RK900 grabs the perp, shoving him against one of the rooftop\u2019s large air-circulation vents.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cTold you not to run, asshole,\u201d Gavin spits out while the android ties the kid\u2019s hands behind his back. His pride withers a little as he leans his hands on his knees, sucking in air while the RK900 stands tall and unaffected and insufferable. \u201cYou can kiss your rights goodbye, makin\u2019 us chase after you like we\u2019re on fucking CSI Miami or somethin\u2019. Shoulda just shot you,\u201d he adds, petty, but purely out of sympathy for his aching lungs and dead legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The RK900 keeps a firm grip on the perp\u2019s wrists, and jerks its head towards the door leading inside. \u201cAfter you, Detective.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin wants nothing more than to collapse on the rooftop until the blood\u2019s stopped pounding in his ears. But whatever remains of his dignity has him leading the way towards the stairwell, trying to get his breathing back under control.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere was no reason for you to pursue me,\u201d the android says, and Gavin knows that what little of his temper\u2019s left is about to </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">fucking snap.</span></em><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0\u201cYou ordered </span> <span class=\"s2\">me</span> <span class=\"s1\"> to go, after all. I expected you to return downstairs with Officer Collins. I was perfectly capable\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, shitbird.\u201d Gavin rounds on the android, ignoring the fearful looking perp in favour of grabbing the lapels of the RK900\u2019s jacket. \u201cListen the fuck up. You don\u2019t get a single fuckin\u2019 say in what I do or don\u2019t do, you got that? You ain\u2019t my partner, you ain\u2019t in charge of me. You\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 </span> <span class=\"s2\">machine</span> <span class=\"s1\">, so when I order you to do somethin\u2019, you damn well better do it, and not question my </span> <span class=\"s2\">fucking</span> <span class=\"s1\"> decisions.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android looks down at him coolly, grasp still firmly around the perp\u2019s wrists. \u201cYour heart-rate is quite elevated, Detective, and your breathing is agitated. I only say there was no reason to pursue me to bear your wellbeing in mind.\u201d It leans closer, and grants Gavin that same cold, fictitious <em>smile</em> it had in Fowler\u2019s office the first time they\u2019d met. \u201cI recommend increasing your weekly gym visitations, if you wish to keep up with me next time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It takes the perp and leaves Gavin on the rooftop, mortified and silent and </span> <span class=\"s2\">seething</span> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And to top the day off, when they return to the station, Hank takes one look at Gavin\u2019s face and snorts loudly enough to rouse Chris\u2019 attention. He looks between Gavin and the android, and </span> <span class=\"s2\">grins</span> <span class=\"s1\">. \u201cSo how\u2019d the first job go, you two?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought it went rather well.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>The Rk900 aims a self-satisfied expression Gavin\u2019s way. \u201cThough we\u2019ve established that Detective Reed\u2019s fitness levels are not quite up to par.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hank\u2019s bark of laughter haunts Gavin for the rest of the afternoon, which is spent filling out paperwork to cover the equipment stolen from the tech store. Each time he looks up and catches the RK900\u2019s eye from across the desk, he makes sure to scowl as though his very unfair life depends on it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As Fowler had warned, they get no fucking luck. They\u2019d have to wait </span> <span class=\"s2\">a few weeks,</span> <span class=\"s1\"> at </span> <span class=\"s2\">least,\u00a0</span><span class=\"s1\">before a warrant to search Mr. Groves\u2019 house could be authorised. Gavin gets it. He <em>really</em> does. There are too many cases, too much going on these days to get anything done quickly. But he\u2019s </span> <span class=\"s2\">always</span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0hated going through the proceedings; all the pointless motions and the waiting around. Waiting around isn\u2019t his style. Too impatient. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Hot-headed</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, Chen\u2019s always calls him. He used to take that as a compliment, but now, at the mature age of thirty-six and not getting any younger or prettier, he suspects it\u2019s closer to an insult.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And lucky him, to top it all off like a rotten cherry on top of a cake full of fucking raisins - seriously, what sick son of a bitch would ruin a cake with </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">raisins</span></em><span class=\"s1\">? They\u2019re just nasty little wrinkles - Gavin now has an uptight nightmare of an android on his back every moment of his working day. He should\u2019ve seen it coming; he\u2019d watched Connor bust Anderson\u2019s ass when they first got partnered together, and he\u2019d watched it with no small amount of smug satisfaction. Well, karma\u2019s a douchebag, isn\u2019t it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">See, it\u2018s all about efficiency when it comes to androids. No room for time-wasting or pleasantries or excuses with them. The RK900 was no different, and Gavin was now living day to day in his own personal hell.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">His </span> <span class=\"s2\">partner</span> <span class=\"s1\"> \u2013 though not his fucking partner, because Gavin </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">didn\u2019t have a fucking partner,\u00a0</span></em><span class=\"s1\">and he felt weird and dirty just using the word - was as hard-assed as it looked. After the robbery, they\u2019d worked on a few smaller cases, and while Gavin can\u2019t deny the android\u2018s every inch as capable as Short Connor, and then some, the shitbag had apparently made it his glorified mission to irritate Gavin to the point where he can no longer physically put his frustration into words.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Not that he\u2019d expected anything else.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One thing that he </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">hadn\u2019t</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> prepped for, however, was the amount of fucking\u00a0</span><em><span class=\"s2\">backtalk</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"> he got from it. Now, Gavin had had his fair share of shit from Connor; the android could hold his own, of that Gavin had no doubt. But the RK900 was on a whole new level of </span> <span class=\"s2\">prick</span><span class=\"s1\">, and Gavin could barely get a word in edgeways. He insulted it, threatened it, </span> <span class=\"s2\">ignored</span> <span class=\"s1\"> it when none of that worked. And each and every time, the android had a retort; some dry remark or deathly quick comeback that left Gavin feeling like a scolded mutt; shrinking down on the floor with his tail between his legs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So when Hank innocently asks, \u201cHow\u2019s the whole partner thing workin\u2019 out?\u201d on Tuesday afternoon, Gavin\u2019s\u00a0</span> <span class=\"s1\">near about ready to set the bullpen on fire and let himself perish in the fucking flames. He\u2019d go out smiling, too, right at the RK900 with his middle finger standing to attention for all to see.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin scowls towards the breakroom, where Tall Connor is heading. He takes in the fitted jacket, the long legs, that </span> <span class=\"s2\">fucking walk</span><span class=\"s1\">, before the android disappears around the corner. \u201cDon\u2019t be cute, Anderson. You know damn well how it\u2019s goin\u2019.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hank chuckles, and Gavin resists the urge to pour what\u2019s left of his coffee onto the man\u2019s shoes. \u201cYeah, that sounds about right. Connor tells me you\u2019ve been gettin\u2019 your ass handed to you. Shame your desk\u2019s the other side of the bullpen,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019d pay <em>good</em> money to listen to your ego taken down another peg or two, maybe while that android bends you over by your terminal again. That made my fuckin\u2019 year.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin regrets coming to spend his lunch break perched on Anderson\u2019s desk. Though ever since Connor officially joined them, they\u2019ve developed a working relationship of sorts. There\u2019s no question, Connor\u2019s made Hank more tolerable; more pleasant to be around, for sure. </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">Easier to talk to</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, Gavin adds to himself. And though they\u2019ve never particularly gotten along, Gavin had used to respect Hank, before\u2013 well, just before. Before the drinking and the attitude. Now there\u2019s a mutual understanding, a level of civility between the two of them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin would never call them </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">friends,\u00a0</span></em><span class=\"s1\">because there\u2019s just no way. But he supposes they\u2019re not quite as far away from the notion of it as they used to be.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow the hell d\u2019you deal with it every day?\u201d Gavin finds himself asking, glancing to where Short Connor is speaking with another officer near the cells. \u201cI\u2019m losin\u2019 my fucking mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou get used to it, trust me. And your new partner ain\u2019t so bad. Chris says he\u2019s all right, and Connor seems to like him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 much,\u201d Gavin bites out, bitter. \u201cConnor likes everybody. For Christ sake, he likes </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">you</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> of all people,\u201d he adds, because he needs to rib a little. Relieves stress, good for the soul, all that shit. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 scumbag.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh yeah, yeah, look who\u2019s talkin\u2019. Mr Scumbag Extraordinaire over here.\u201d Anderson shoves at Gavin\u2019s thigh with his elbow, turning back to his terminal to resume whatever file he was looking over before lunch. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to suck it up, Reed. This is the way of the world now; androids and humans workin\u2019 together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot a fuckin\u2019 chance.\u201d Gavin slides off the desk and back onto his feet, popping the base of his spine as he stretches backwards. \u201cSoon as this case is over, I\u2019m <em>done</em> workin\u2019 with plastic dipshits. I am never setting foot in the same room as that asshole again, I don\u2019t care what Fowler says, he can kiss my ass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell him you said that,\u201d Anderson calls after him, chuckling as Gavin stalks towards the breakroom to refill his mug.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Another step away from rounding the corner, Gavin stills when he hears his own name from one of the tables.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cStill stuck with Gavin for a few weeks, huh? <em>Yeesh</em>.\u201d Chris. \u201cHe\u2019s</span> <span class=\"s1\">never taken well to androids. Don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever quite worked out what his problem is. Probably any number of things.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective Reed\u2019s reasons are his own.\u201d The RK900. Gavin\u2019s seen it and Chris speak a few times before. Chris is popular with everyone in the DPD, though; no one\u2019s ever got a bad word to say about him, and new people always seem to gravitate over his way. It appears androids aren\u2019t an exception. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish to pry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably a smart move. Gavin\u2019s not really the most </span> <span class=\"s2\">forthcoming</span> <span class=\"s1\"> guy around here. Think even Chen gets sick of his shit, sometimes. I\u2019ve never worked a proper case with him for long, but I know he\u2019s\u2026\u201d Chris sounds like he hesitates as he searches for the word he wants. \u201cI dunno. Difficult, I guess? Hostile? I reckon you\u2019ve probably worked with Reed more in the last week than I have in seven years, so I can\u2019t exactly say for certain. And I\u2019d hate to talk about a fellow officer behind his back or anything, but from what I can tell, no one really enjoys working with him in the field.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Something, somewhere deep in Gavin\u2019s gut, clenches and turns white hot while he listens. Yeah, tell him something he doesn\u2019t already know. He </span> <span class=\"s2\">knows</span> <span class=\"s1\"> what most of the DPD thinks of him, and he\u2019s put little fucking effort in to change it. He\u2019s arrogant, and selfish, and unfriendly, and yeah, he\u2019s </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">difficult</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, he fucking </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">knows</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> that he\u2019s difficult.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But there\u2019s something about hearing it in Chris\u2019s voice that really nails the coffin. And Gavin\u2019s hands start to shake. Oh no,\u00a0</span><span class=\"s2\"><em>no no no, not here, not fucking here, it isn\u2019t worth it getting worked up about this of all fucking things, you\u2019re fine, you\u2019re fine, you\u2019re fine</em>.</span> <span class=\"s1\"> Fuck Chris, fuck everyone. Not like Gavin can snap his fingers like Thanos and make every fucked up thing about himself disappear, is it. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective Reed can be\u2026\u201d and Gavin feels his shoulders tense up as the RK900 replies, \u201c...antagonistic, it\u2019s true. I can understand why a human may not particularly enjoy working with him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a beat of silence, and Gavin\u2019s just about geared himself up to storm inside and savour the guilty look on Chris\u2019s face while he refills his coffee and pretends he isn\u2019t feeling the worthlessness and the anxiety building inside him or that he can\u2019t get enough air into his lungs because he\u2019s probably about to have a fucking panic attack in the middle of the bullpen, in front of fucking everybody.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Then the android continues.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut he\u2019s also a good detective. I\u2019ve found his skill and perseverance in the field to be most impressive. He is aggressive and temperamental, there\u2018s no question. But while his attitude may not be ideal for an accommodating partnership, I feel fortunate to have been paired with someone of his clear capabilities. So I believe I must defend him,\u201d it adds, its tone taking on a slight edge, \u201cin this area, at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>\u201cShit</em>,\u201d Chris laughs, \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day where someone defends Gavin fucking Reed. You really must be an advanced model.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The rest of the conversation filters away, as Gavin manages to return to his desk without causing a scene, with an empty coffee cup in his hand and weak knees and suddenly feeling like the world\u2019s shifted upside-fucking-down. He tries to focus on his terminal, but the words on the screen become intelligible little shapes and edges in front of his eyes, and there\u2019s a bitter, </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">sheepish</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"> taste in the back of his mouth. He didn\u2019t actually have a full blown attack though, so. Small victories, hell take it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Chen knocks him on the shoulder, he feels better. Almost like himself again. But he\u2019s gotten absolutely no work done since he sat down. \u201cHey, Reed, I\u2019m headin\u2019 home. Thought I\u2019d check in before I left.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHm,\u201d Gavin grunts in reply.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhere\u2019s your partner, huh?\u201d He notices Chen\u2019s gaze scouring the bullpen. She smiles at his sour expression, \u201cWhat, you finally drive that plastic piece of shit crazy and made him bail? About time, right? Still think Fowler had a brain seizure, thinking it was a good idea to put you two together\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t call it that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Chen blinks. \u201cWhat? Call who what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe android, don\u2019t call it that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s silence for a few seconds, and then Chen snorts and moves to lean against his desk. \u201cWhat, did we decide on somethin\u2019 other than piece of shit?\u201d she jeers, snapping her fingers as she thinks. The sudden sound of it makes irritation clench tightly in Gavin\u2019s chest. \u201cWhat was there... there was Tall Connor, plastic prick, Terminator Arnold Schwartzen\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cChen, shut the fuck up.\u201d Gavin bites it out with all the shame and the anger he\u2019s been feeling since the breakroom. He turns stubbornly back to his screen to stop himself from getting up in her face, and to hide the flush heating up all over his own. But he doesn\u2019t back down or try and laugh it off as a joke. It\u2019s not a joke. \u201cJust go home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">She grabs her bag and leaves, calling him an asshole under hear breath. Gavin stays hunched at his terminal, pretending to read the files while the conversation replays again and again and a-fucking-gain in his mind. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">I also think he\u2019s a good detective\u2026 skill and perseverance in the field\u2026 I feel fortunate to have been paired with someone of his clear capabilities\u2026 I believe I must defend him, in this area at least.</span> </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sharp, precise footsteps get closer and stop behind him. \u201cDetective Reed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin glances up, and feels his jaw tense uncomfortably. \u201cThe fuck d\u2019</span><span class=\"s2\">you</span> <span class=\"s1\"> want?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The RK900 holds out a fresh cup of coffee; dark and steaming and probably just the way Gavin likes it. Of course its just the fucking way he likes it. Androids never do anything by halves. \u201cYou skipped lunch,\u201d it offers as an explanation. \u201cAnd caffeine seems to put you in a more agreeable mood. So for everyone\u2019s sake, I thought I might as well take the liberty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin accepts the cup, to stop the thing from talking if nothing else, and places it down near his mouse. \u201cDon\u2019t expect a thank you. Fuck off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android, unaffected, moves to its own desk to resume its work. Gavin makes the coffee last for the next twenty minutes, taking savouring little sips here and there as he finally manages to focus on the reports in his inbox.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When the cup\u2019s empty, Gavin peers across to the twin desk. Hesitates. Then steels himself. Gavin Reed\u2019s a fuck up for sure, but he isn\u2019t a fucking coward. \u201cThanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The RK900 meets his gaze. Its eyes are narrowed, curious and icy and\u2013 not grey, Gavin realises suddenly. Blue. They\u2019re blue.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Detective,\u201d it answers, and that calm, crisp note to its voice all of a sudden doesn\u2019t piss Gavin off quite as much today.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They each return to their respective tasks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Something changes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin doesn\u2019t know how the hell else to put it. After that whole ordeal, something just changes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The RK900\u2019s still a nasty piece of work. It\u2019s still smug and shitty and prissy and conceited, and it seems to go out of its way to tear Gavin a new one every chance it gets. </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">That</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"> hasn\u2019t changed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s changed, Gavin\u2019s snail-paced ability to have epiphanies is trying to haul ass and tell him, is that he\u2019s potentially, maybe, kind of starting to get used to</span> <span class=\"s1\">it. Starting to like it, even. Enjoy it. A little bit.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just... </span> <span class=\"s2\">different</span> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">See, the deal is, there are very, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">very</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> few people in the precinct who can match Gavin toe-to-toe; who can face down his bullshit and throw it straight back in his face without eventually taking a closer look and deciding he ain\u2019t worth the hassle. He\u2019s pretty sure Chen and Anderson are the only ones who\u2019ve ever really been like that. And even then, they\u2019re not at </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">this</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> level.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Neither of </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">them</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> have ever sparked this stupid, fucking nerve in Gavin\u2019s stomach that starts to simmer and froth and tug in anticipation whenever he sits down at his desk first thing in the morning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood morning, Detective Reed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, mornin\u2019.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA most interesting shirt today,\u201c the RK900 says, eyebrows raised in the direction of the admittedly inappropriate Rick and Morty T\u2019shirt that Gavin couldn\u2019t be bothered to try hide beneath his jacket. \u201cAre you trying to offend a particular individual today or do you hope that the effect is strong enough to ensure no one comes within a meter\u2019s radius of you at all?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And so it begins. \u201cYeah, <em>you</em> can talk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can, indeed. You like to point out the obvious, don\u2019t you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWas referrin\u2019 to your collar, numb nuts. You wanna make it any fuckin\u2019 higher, hide the rest of that crap pile excuse for a face?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting. Interesting. If you wished to divert attention away from your own shortcomings, then I must disappoint you. Your choice of attire does anything but.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPrick.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cStill deflecting, Detective.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m callin\u2019 you a prick, prick. Keep the fuck up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin doesn\u2019t know when he stopped thinking the android\u2019s eyes were cold. Probably when it started looking at him like that. \u201cCoffee, Detective?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d Gavin waits until the android\u2019s a good distance away before he lets himself smile. No way he\u2019ll give the fucker that satisfaction. He\u2019s been doing a lot more of that lately, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">smiling</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> that is. Some select people around the bullpen are beginning to look more concerned by the day.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Apart from Anderson. Hank\u2019s shit-smothered face just keeps getting more and more smug every time he catches Gavin\u2019s eye. And Short Connor looks pleased by whatever common ground Tall Connor and Gavin have found between them, though it\u2019s hard to tell with Connor these days; since he moved in with Anderson, he <em>always</em> looks pleased. Gavin\u2019s never quite worked out what\u2019s precisely going on with them, and the idea of just up and asking feels wrong on every level. If he had to hazard a guess or force himself to think about it at all, he\u2019d say their relationship probably isn\u2019t as professional as they let on around the station. Gavin\u2018s sure that prospect would\u2019ve freaked him out once upon a time. But, truthfully, seeing Anderson slowly getting his shit back together, and catching Connor\u2019s stupid little smiles around the precinct, Gavin genuinely wishes the best of fucking luck to the two of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jesus, he\u2019s not usually <em>that</em> much of a soft prick. Probably the lack of fucking caffeine making him stir crazy.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And speak of the Devil, the RK900 returns with Gavin\u2019s coffee. It\u2019s dark and bitter and </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">perfect</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, and Gavin feels his morning cravings and headache ease with the first glorious sip.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey,\u201d he pipes up, after the caffeine\u2019s reached his brain and the RK900\u2019s taken its seat behind the opposite desk. \u201cWe worked out this warrant bullshit yet? It\u2019s been, what, like two weeks now? Those stiff necks</span> <span class=\"s1\">\u00a0downstairs are taking their sweet fuckin\u2019 time.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android hums, typing quickly and precisely on its keyboard. \u201cI checked in with Captain Fowler yesterday afternoon. The warrant still hasn\u2019t been approved, though I doubt it will take much longer. Officer Miller has just closed his case, so I expect ours will now take precedence.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan\u2019t believe this shit. I get that things in the city haven\u2019t been all sunshine and rainbows lately, but this is fucking pushin\u2019 it. Nearly three weeks waiting on a <em>search warrant</em>,\u201d Gavin mutters, although he\u2019s sure the coffee\u2018s made him at least forty-percent less irritated about it all. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of paper, like, come the fuck on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMr. Groves is a man of importance, don\u2019t forget. A renowned individual in the field of architecture. And considering his reluctance in allowing us to investigate his home,\u201d the android points out, \u201cthe fact that we\u2019re getting the warrant at all is fortunate. I believe we can forgive the wait.\u201d It offers Gavin a thin and ironic smile. \u201cPatience is a virtue, Detective. You\u2019re lacking a fair few already, so that is one you unfortunately cannot afford to squander.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe has a point, Detective Reed,\u201d Short Connor remarks in passing. He easily manages to sidestep the kick Gavin aims for his shin.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGet fucked, Connor.\u201d Gavin glares across the desk at the still-smiling RK900. \u201cYou can get fucked, too, tin can.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFinish your coffee, Detective. It\u2019s far easier to tolerate you when you do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin smirks against his cup, feeling the crappy six AM wake up and the rushed breakfast and the downpour of rain outside fade into non-existence.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Chen walks into the bullpen by seven thirty; shoots Gavin a look when she glances between him and the RK900. She\u2019s still ratty about his attitude on Friday, and she\u2019s been avoiding him. It does piss Gavin off \u2013 Chen\u2019s more often than not the only person he can stand to be around for any extended time \u2013 but he won\u2019t say anything because he\u2019s stubborn, and Tina\u2019s stubborn, and he knows neither of them are gonna apologise. She\u2019s an asshole. Gavin\u2019s a bigger asshole. That\u2019s just a fucking given. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So Gavin stays quiet when Chen saunters by his desk without a word. He faces his terminal instead. Glances up at Tall Connor opposite him. And is suddenly very fucking conscious of something that probably should\u2018ve come up in conversation on day one.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou even got a name?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The RK900 peers up at him. \u201cWhat do you call me to everybody else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAsshole. Shitbird. Tall Connor. Sometimes self-righteous prick, if the situation calls for it. Gotta switch it up now and then, y\u2019know. Gets borin\u2019, otherwise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android\u2019s mouth twitches in amusement. Its eyes are so, so much warmer when it does, for just that split second. \u201cNot a particularly imaginative range. But given that I\u2019ve become well accustomed to your lack of creativity, I suppose it\u2019s the best I could have hoped for,\u201d it muses. \u201cBut in answer to your question, no. I wasn\u2019t given a name when I was activated.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat, so it isn\u2019t Tall Connor. Connor Mark Two. Upgraded Connor. The sequel of Connor?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The RK900 chuckles. Honest to God </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">chuckles</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. Gavin\u2019s so taken aback by the sudden,\u00a0<em>genuine</em> sound of it that his coffee almost slides out of his hand. Smooth, Reed. He places it down onto the safe surface of the desk.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSeriously, though. No name</span> <span class=\"s2\"> at all</span> <span class=\"s1\">? You gotta give me somethin\u2019 else to go on besides asshole, shitbird and Tall Connor. That kinda talk might get me suspended.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It chuckles again. Gavin can\u2019t really imagine Connor chuckling, but the RK900\u2019s is a soft and husky sound that makes his toes ashamedly curl for a moment. Only a fucking moment, though, calm down.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m sure the precinct will weep at your absence, should your suspension come about. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I have no name,\u201d it says. \u201cOnly my model identification, RK900, and a serial number, 31\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cR.K,\u201d Gavin blurts out. You know, like a fucking idiot. The android tilts its head in question. \u201cR.K ain\u2019t bad. It\u2019s part of your ID, right,\u201d Gavin - pretty valiantly he thinks, thank you very much - soldiers on, \u201dlike a nickname. Plus it\u2019s not a fuckin\u2019 mouthful like <em>RK900, serial number what the fuck ever</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The android seems to be considering, LED circling yellow. It\u2019s silent for long enough that Gavin starts to feel very fucking uneasy. He should probably say something else, brush off the idea somehow so he doesn\u2019t look like such a dumbass. But then-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat sounds agreeable,\u201d the android \u2013 </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">R.K</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, says at last, granting Gavin a small nod of acceptance. \u201cIt may be good, to have a name. It would certainly make communication easier. And lessen the risk of you becoming suspended, of course.\u201d And then it smiles. Not a shitty, dry attempt at a smile either, not like usual. This is an actual, honest to God, fucking </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">smile.</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Connor\u2019s smiles, as twitchy and awkward as they are, always have a small scrap of charm to them, as much as admitting it makes Gavin want to squirm. A lot of things about Connor have the kind of charm that comes with watching a baby deer trying to walk for the first time, or something equally cringey and endearing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The smile that R.K gives him? No. Not even close. It\u2019s this small and handsome curl at one side his mouth, and in short, it\u2019s plain sinful. It's wicked, and teasing, and so unexpected that Gavin suddenly feels his elbow slip off the side of the desk from where it\u2019d been supporting his weight.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Really smooth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He clears his throat, and slowly turns back to face the documents on his terminal. \u201cCool. R.K it is then. Now shut the fuck up and let me work, dickwad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin hears a hum of agreement, and tries to shrug off the too-warm flush making its way from his neck to his earlobes. \u201cIndeed, Detective.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A few minutes later, after Gavin deems enough time\u2019s passed for him to <em>not</em> be embarrassed about his dumb little elbow slip, his curiosity gets the better of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat d\u2019you call </span> <span class=\"s2\">me</span> <span class=\"s1\"> to everyone else, then?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI call you Detective Reed,\u201d R.K answers, gaze trained on his own terminal. \u201cThough I have changed your name in my facial recognition processor to </span> <span class=\"s2\">Asshole</span><span class=\"s1\">,\u201d he adds, out of nowhere, and Gavin\u2018s coffee spurts very attractively out of his mouth.</span></p>\n<p><em>-----------------------------\u00a0 </em>Sunday 6<sup>th</sup> May, 2039 (AM)\u00a0<em>-----------------------------<br>\n</em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><u>RK900 #313 248 317 -87</u></strong><strong><br>\n</strong><em>(07:30)</em><br>\nNot gracing the DPD with your presence today, Detective?</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u><br>\n</strong><em>(07:41)</em><br>\nfuck off its sunday</p>\n<p><strong><u>RK900 #313 248 317 -87</u><br>\n</strong><em>(07:42)</em><br>\nI\u2019m aware.</p>\n<p><em>(07:42)</em><br>\nMy question still stands.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br>\n<em>(07:44)</em><br>\nits my day off prick leave me alone</p>\n<p><em>(07:59)</em><br>\nhow you get my number??</p>\n<p><strong><u>RK900 #313 248 317 -87</u><br>\n</strong><em>(08:00)</em><br>\nIt\u2019s standard protocol.

Is that supposed to be a fuckin joke? Fine time to find a sense of humour, shitbird. And news flash, you ain\u2019t funny.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI have yet to do something about his language, as you can see,\u201d R.K continues. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get there. I was not programmed to fail.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Angie gives Gavin a little pat on the arm. \u201cWell, sounds like you don\u2019t take any of his crap, R.K. That\u2019s good, I reckon he needs someone like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFuck off, Angie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019ve got a decent one here, Reed,\u201d she says, and yeah, thanks Angie, tell Gavin something he isn\u2019t already painfully aware of. \u201cNever seen a partner of yours last this long without quitting your sorry ass before, so you must be doing something right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWon\u2019t last. If he keeps his bullshit up, he\u2019ll be plastic and metal scrap by the end of the day,\u201d Gavin warns. R.K only smiles thinly in response. By now, Gavin expects the guy knows an empty promise when he hears one.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Angie waves over her shoulder as she heads for the elevator. \u201cGood luck with the case, boys.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The drive to Michael Groves\u2019s house isn\u2019t infuriatingly long. Gavin even manages to educate R.K a little in the world of music on the way. The\u00a0android doesn\u2019t seem particularly keen on anything, but at least it\u2019s an </span> <span class=\"s2\">attempt</span> <span class=\"s1\"> at a bold start.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, fuckin\u2019 sit on it,\u201d Gavin says, raising his middle finger until it\u2019s level with R\u2019s face. It's his response to the claim that his music taste is </span> <span class=\"s2\"> <em>boorish and unvaried.</em></span><span class=\"s1\"> Coming from someone so uptight that shoving coal up his ass would result in diamonds a week later, that claim's pretty rich, if Gavin may fucking say so. \u201cWhat would you rather listen to, then, smartass? Lemme guess, classical fuckin\u2019 music?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere is a degree of appeal to classical music,\u201d R.K muses. \u201cThe notes are methodical, the structure precise. You wouldn\u2019t happen to have any to listen to, though, I suppose.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo I look like I\u2019d be interested in that classical shit?\u201d Purely out of spite, Gavin turns the volume up on the radio, though it does little more than cause R.K to arch a mildly disapproving eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It hits Gavin abruptly, as these pleasant little thoughts always do, as they\u2019re driving along the outskirts of Central Detroit; with the city passing them by and R.K beside him in the passenger\u2019s seat, where he\u2019s been a constant for near on a month now. It hits him, that if they find evidence of the ex-husband\u2019s or his android\u2019s involvement in the assault on Lydia Groves, then the case will be officially closed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K will be reassigned to another partner</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s what Gavin\u2019s wanted since day one.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He turns off the radio like it\u2019s done him a personal insult.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs everything all right, Detective?\u201d From the corner of his eye, Gavin can see R.K studying him from across the gear stick. He wonders what the android can see on his face. How much he can see.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t it be.\u201d It comes out way more petulant than he\u2019d intended. Fuck it. Why\u2019s it R\u2019s business whether everything\u2019s </span> <span class=\"s2\">all right</span> <span class=\"s1\">. Short answer, it\u2019s <em>not</em> his business. Never was, never fucking will be, period.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI only ask because you don\u2019t typically turn the radio off, even when I suggest it. Or you\u2019ve at least struck up another reluctant attempt at a conversation\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">fine</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. What, a guy can\u2019t enjoy a little peace and quiet? Stop </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">fuckin</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">\u2019 analysing me.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He hasn\u2019t snapped at R.K like that in a while. And it clearly takes the android by surprise, though of course no one else would fucking notice. R.K barely leaves a crease in his clothes from how little he reacts. But Gavin <em>knows</em> those telltale little tics; can </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">feel</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> the sudden tension in the car, the strain in the space between them that abruptly seems a whole lot wider than it did when Gavin first started up the engine and needled the android about always managing to get his seatbelt without it snagging on something.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s obvious in the way R.K\u2019s posture is just a </span> <span class=\"s2\">little</span> <span class=\"s1\"> stiffer than normal, as he rests his palms on his thighs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fuck. Fuck, fuck, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">fuck</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. Gavin suddenly, crushingly despises himself.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI just wanna get this case over with already,\u201d he\u00a0mutters, lying through his teeth. He\u2019s not fucking apologising. But maybe he can get somewhat of a point across. \u201cIt\u2019s been fuckin\u2019 weeks, I don\u2019t like waitin\u2019 around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI understand.\u201d R.K\u2019s voice isn\u2019t right. Gavin doesn\u2019t know, can\u2019t detect </span> <span class=\"s2\">why</span> <span class=\"s1\">, exactly, it <em>isn\u2019t right</em>, but it\u2019s just... </span> <span class=\"s2\">not</span> <span class=\"s1\">. \u201cI know having a partner forced onto you hasn\u2019t helped matters, but now that we have the warrant\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, shitbird, I didn\u2019t\u2013\u201d Gavin cuts himself off, frustration causing him to squeeze his eyes shut. Clearly, then, he </span> <span class=\"s2\">can\u2019t</span> <span class=\"s1\"> get a point across.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><em>You\u2019re not going to get anything across by not being honest, dipshit,</em>\u00a0</span> <span class=\"s1\">a voice in the back of his head points out to him. It sounds suspiciously like Anderson\u2019s voice, and Gavin really doesn\u2019t want to spend time analysing why the hell that is.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Fuck. How the fuck is he supposed to say anything he wants to say? <em>Everything</em> he wants to say?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em> <span class=\"s2\">Just get the fuck over yourself</span> <span class=\"s1\">. </span> <span class=\"s2\">Swallow your dumb, pointless pride and just say what you wanna fucking say</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"><em>.</em> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Right. Okay. Okay, c\u2019mon, Gavin Reed\u2019s not a fucking coward. Fuck, okay. He\u2019s got this.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHaving a partner\u2019s been all right. You\u2019re cool. We\u2019re cool.\u201d Gavin chances a glimpse at R.K, and feels his knuckles tighten over the steering wheel at the sight of the android's barely-there smile. \u201cI just mean it hasn\u2019t been as bad as I thought it\u2019d be, dickwad, don\u2019t let it go to your head or anythin\u2019.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And to Gavin\u2019s mortification, R.K turns his gaze away and trains it ahead onto the road. Silent. Totally fucking silent. </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Fuck</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But then, \u201cLikewise. You\u2019re emotionally unstable, and you curse far too much, and you consume more caffeine than strictly recommended for someone of your height and age,\u201d R says. \u201cBut I have enjoyed working with you. It\u2019s certainly never boring.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin shakes his head. But it\u2019s fond, he knows it\u2019s fucking fond, and he can feel a fair bit of that crushing weight from before lifting off of him, replaced by relief that he won\u2019t admit for a hundred-thousand years. \u201cWould\u2019ve cut that a lot shorter if you\u2019d just called me an asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cVery well. You\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then they\u2019re good. It\u2019s that simple. That easy. It\u2019s like they never had a blip at all; no Gavin lashing out and screwing things up, no R.K closing himself off behind fancy-ass words and his sophisticated fucking programming. They\u2019re fine. They\u2019re good.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin doesn\u2019t know how, really. He\u2019s never had a dynamic <em>like</em> it with someone before, not like </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">this</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. R just... gets him. Or forgives him, or sees through his bullshit, or maybe it\u2019s something else. Gavin\u2019s never lingered on it for too long to try and work it all out; if he starts to think about any of it too deeply, he\u2019ll fuck it all up, he knows he will. The point is that it works, doesn\u2019t matter </span> <span class=\"s2\">how</span> <span class=\"s1\">, so it\u2019s probably best, in Gavin\u2019s track record anyway, for him to just live in blissful ignorance and let whatever the fuck they\u2019re doing that makes them work so well together carry on unimpeded by his pesky, detective impulse to overthink everything.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When they pull into Michael Groves\u2019 driveway, Gavin gives a long, low whistle as he steps out the car and looks up at the house. He has to crane his neck to do so. <em>Goddamn</em>.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If Lydia Groves\u2019s digs had made him feel like a second-class citizen, then it\u2019s fucking nothing compared to her ex-husband\u2019s. After over a decade of making a name for himself as Kamski\u2019s </span> <span class=\"s2\">go-to </span> <span class=\"s1\">architect, Michael Groves is just about as wealthy as a man can possibly be. From just the front porch alone, Gavin doesn\u2019t fucking doubt it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cJesus. H. </span> <span class=\"s2\">Christ</span> <span class=\"s1\">. Should\u2019ve become an architect, this place is a goddamn fortress.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA considerable proficiency in maths is required to pursue an architectural career.\u201d Though R.K, too, looks slightly enthralled as he takes in the size of the estate, not that his expression gives much away. Gavin can only tell by the way his head\u2019s cocked </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">just so</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> as he lets his gaze wander over the scene in front of them. \u201cMr. Groves is a former acquaintance of Elijah Kamski. I believe they studied together at the University of Colbridge.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI swear, everyone that University spat out became a rich, pompous piece of shit. Kamski\u2019s one of \u2018em, for sure,\u201d Gavin assures as they make their way to the illustrious front gates. \u201cA real creepy, cryptic son of a bitch. Bet he makes all his interviewers feel like shit, never gives \u2018em a straight answer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI would guess that as someone in his position, he\u2019s going for </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">enigmatic</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> rather than </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">creepy</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. But you do have a point,\u201d R.K concedes. \u201cThere is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. A line </span> <span class=\"s2\">you</span> <span class=\"s1\"> walk hazardously,\u201d he adds dryly, though Gavin knows that teasing tone well enough to clock it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He quickly forgets the grandeur of the building after making first contact with Mr. Groves over the intercom. Nearly a month of waiting for approval on the fucking search warrant, and Gavin doesn\u2019t even get the chance to push it into Groves\u2019 smug, architect face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Or in other words, their suspect refuses to let them the fuck inside. Despite the fact that Gavin makes it </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">very fucking clear</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> that, considering they jumped through fucking hoops and now they\u00a0</span> <span class=\"s2\"><em>have</em> the fucking warrant</span> <span class=\"s1\">, they\u2018re liable to take him into the station by force should he make things difficult, the front door remains firmly closed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Gavin bites out, buzzing the intercom again for a full ten seconds. \u201cYou\u2019re a prime fuckin\u2019 suspect in a DPD investigation, so you better open the fuck up or I swear to God\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective.\u201d R.K remains a calm and collected buffer at his side, regarding the closed door placidly as though it will glide open by some kind of voodoo android eye-contact alone. \u201cI doubt that coercion, no matter how colourful, is going to convince him to allow us entry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay, smartass,\u201d Gavin aims a smile that\u2019s far more sneer up at him, and spreads his arms, welcoming input, \u201cwhat d\u2019you suggest we do then? Camp out here till fuckin\u2019 sundown, freezing our asses off until this prick lets us in outta the kindness of his heart?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe have the warrant,\u201d R.K points out, and Gavin actually feels a little pang of trepidation at the pensive expression on his partner\u2019s face. R can be a scarily crafty bastard when he wants to be. \u201cI was going to suggest simply hacking the door and letting ourselves in to begin our search. But if you\u2019d prefer to, as you put it, </span> <span class=\"s2\">camp out</span> <span class=\"s1\"> until we wear Mr. Groves down, then at least it proves your patience has come quite a way.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin frowns. He\u2019s fucking </span> <span class=\"s2\">certain</span> <span class=\"s1\"> he misheard that. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously sayin\u2019 you wanna break in?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m saying that we are within our right to enter the residence. Through any means necessary.\u201d R.K grants him that thin smile that Gavin\u2019s come to find less irritating and more endearing by the day. \u201cWe have a valid search warrant. Mr. Groves is denying us. I wouldn\u2019t deem that </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">breaking in</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">, Detective.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin shakes his head, muttering, \u201cKnew you were a fuckin\u2019 maniac,\u201d under his breath as he gives the neighbourhood behind them a quick and wary once-over. Then he motions to the door, \u201cWell, what the fuck are you waitin\u2019 for then? Get a move on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It takes around fifteen seconds of R.K laying his hand on Mr. Groves\u2019 keypad, and then they\u2019re inside the house and shutting the front door behind them. Gavin makes sure to put special force into slamming it closed; let the rich cockhead know they\u2019re there.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The welcoming foyer is large, and lining the walls are models of the buildings Groves has designed, Gavin assumes, and everything is white enough to bring on an instant headache. But still, there\u2019s no sign of their suspect coming to argue with them some more.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMichael Groves,\u201d Gavin calls, ceiling high enough that his voice echoes off the surfaces and around the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve purposefully hindered our investigation. We\u2019re gonna have to do this the hard way and take you downtown.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOnce we\u2019ve searched your property for the ST300 model cited in your ex-wife\u2019s statement,\u201d R.K adds, supposedly scanning around for a heat signature. Gavin can usually tell, more often than not; the android\u2019s gaze becomes slightly distant whenever he scans something, whereas Connor always starts blinking rapidly. \u201cThis will be quite simple,\u00a0so long as you choose to cooperate from here on\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then, by life\u2019s bittersweet design, things go spectacularly to shit from there.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The gunshot barely registers, despite the sound of the blast ricocheting off the foyer walls. R.K moving to shield him and the blue spray of thirium that splatters across his jacket is all Gavin can focus on. It\u2019s like he\u2019s watching it under water, in slow motion. He sees every droplet burst free, every bright blue particle suddenly staining R.K\u2019s coat; pooling around his left shoulder and running in rivulets down his arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cStay where you are!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin suddenly has tunnel vision; instinctively focused on one thing at a time, the highest threat at the forefront of his concentration, adrenaline and years of training setting on the motions instantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Michael Groves is stood at the top of a small set of stairs leading to another part of the house. Early forties, greying hair, blue shirt tucked into dress pants. Pastel pink tie that Gavin wants to </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">strangle</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> the man with, and well-manicured hands \u2013 the hands of someone who probably hasn\u2019t done a day of manual labour in their life \u2013 clutching a Beretta 92 and pointing it directly at R.K. \u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin\u2019s first instinct is to step in front \u2013 </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">protect, protect, protect, shoot again you piece of fucking shit</span> </em><em><span class=\"s2\">and you\u2019re dead, I\u2019ll kill you my-fucking-self</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> \u2013 and he feels himself start to move, sees the red flash of R\u2019s LED and the open bullet wound oozing thirium from the android\u2019s shoulder in the blurred and colourful corners of his vision.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But R.K holds out an arm, keeping Gavin firmly defended behind him as he directs his own weapon at the man.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin\u2019s having fucking <em>none of it</em>. He draws his gun and moves to the side, out of R.K\u2019s guard, aiming the barrel at Mr. Groves\u2019s head. \u201cDrop the gun! You just fired at an officer, we\u2019re takin\u2019 you in\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI told you to <em>stay away,\u201d</em> Mr. Groves spits out, jabbing the gun forward hazardously and making Gavin tighten his grip on his own. He can see the man\u2019s arms shaking. Groves has clearly never used the gun before. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here, I told them I wasn\u2019t letting <em>any</em> officers come here!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDrop the weapon! Don\u2019t be fuckin\u2019 stupid\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll shoot! I swear to God, I\u2019ll shoot\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMr. Groves,\u201d R.K cuts across him evenly. \u201cDon\u2019t make the situation more problematic than you already have. I have contacted the DPD and squad cars are on their way to this location. You can make this easier for yourself by cooperating with us and lowering the gun\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo! No, you\u2019ll take her!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin sees the man\u2019s arms begin to waver even more, index finger trembling against the gun\u2019s trigger. The urge to shift in front of R.K is becoming something raw now, something desperate; thirium\u2019s dripping onto the ground, the blue a stark and sickening contrast against the white floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI won\u2019t let you take her! It\u2019s not her <em>fault</em>, it <em>wasn\u2019t her </em></span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">fault!\u201d</span> </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe fuck are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know what Lydia told you, she\u2019s lying! But you won\u2019t listen, no one will </span> <span class=\"s2\"><em>ever</em> <em>listen!</em></span> <span class=\"s1\"> Not when it comes to androids! I thought it would be different after Markus, but it isn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMr. Groves, you need to calm down and lower your weapon\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo!\u201d The man straightens his arms, turning the gun on Gavin instead, and from the edge of his vision, Gavin sees R.K flinch in his direction. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not taking her away! She didn\u2019t do anything <em>wrong</em>\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMichael, that\u2019s enough!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Keeping his weapon trained on Mr. Groves, Gavin glances towards the new voice. At the other side of the foyer stands their prime suspect, the ST300; LED removed and hands in the air in a show of surrender.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMadeline, I told you to stay hidden!\u201d Mr. Groves snaps. \u201cGoddamn it, I\u2019m trying to </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">protect</span> <span class=\"s1\"> you\u2013\u201d</span> </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou shot a </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">police officer</span></em><span class=\"s1\">, Michael! This has gone too far.\u201d The ST300 slowly makes her way closer to Gavin. There are tears staining her cheeks, but she looks resolved. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, voice quaking. \u201cI just wanted to stay hidden until things calmed down, I didn\u2019t mean for this to go so far. Please, he was just trying to keep me safe.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">She seems to notice R.K then, eyes widening when she sees thirium instead of red soaking through his clothes. \u201cHe has an android with him, Michael, they might understand\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey won\u2019t! No one will ever understand, Madeline, you already tried that with Lydia!\u201d Mr. Groves is still pointing the gun at him. Gavin considers the amount of time it would take to reach him, take the man by surprise and take him out, but he doubts he could make it before Groves took the shot. \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to change\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd </span> <span class=\"s2\">you\u2019re</span> <span class=\"s1\"> not going to make things any better by waving a gun around!\u201d Madeline yells. Then she seems to rein herself back in, pressing her lips together as her shoulders deflate, and then she meets Gavin\u2019s gaze again. \u201cI\u2019m the one you\u2019re here for, and I\u2019m surrendering. But I exercise my right as an android to be questioned by one of my own people.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood for you,\u201d Gavin snarls, before returning his attention to Mr. Groves. He can hear the sirens of the squad cars pulling up outside \u201cNow </span> <span class=\"s2\">you</span> <span class=\"s1\">. Put the fuckin\u2019 gun down and get on the ground, I won\u2019t ask again. You\u2019re both comin\u2019 to the station.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPlease, Michael. There\u2019s nothing more you can do,\u201d Madeline pleads, and that seems to break through to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Mr. Groves lowers the gun, and it slips from his fingers and clatters onto the hard floor. Gavin kicks it away when he gets closer, and he\u2019s cuffing Mr. Groves\u2019s hands behind his back, R.K doing the same to the ST300, when Hank and Chris enter the house followed by three more officers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJesus. The <em>fuck</em> happened here.\u201d Anderson makes his way over to Gavin, noticing the blue stains on his clothes. \u201cShit, Reed, you both all right\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin hauls Mr. Groves back onto his feet, shoving him at Hank. \u201cJust take this asshole to the car.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The second Anderson closes his hand around Mr. Groves\u2019s arm, Gavin\u2019s crossing the foyer, sidestepping Chris as he escorts the ST300 away, and he grasps R.K by the sleeve to spin him around.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid it hit anythin\u2019?\u201d Gavin\u2019s vision buzzes from how frantically his eyes dart over R.K\u2019s shoulder, taking in the circular tear in the android\u2019s jacket where exposed wires and circuits are flashing blue beneath the synthetic skin. \u201cR, did it </span> <span class=\"s2\"> <em>fucking hit anythin\u2019\u2013\u201d</em> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo.\u201d R.K\u2019s taken his wrist, keeping him from touching anything. Gavin hadn\u2019t even realised his hand had been clutching at the android\u2019s shirt. \u201cNothing that can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Gavin can hear his voice trembling and he </span><span class=\"s2\">hates it</span><span class=\"s1\">; hates that his fingers are trembling too, that his vision is hazy and swaying where it fixates on the wound that would have been Gavin\u2019s if R.K hadn\u2019t been </span><span class=\"s2\">such</span> <span class=\"s2\">a</span> <span class=\"s2\">fucking idiot</span><span class=\"s1\">. \u201cWhy the <em>fuck</em> would you <em>do that\u2013\u201d</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective, if I hadn\u2019t\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat, you think I\u2019m gonna <em>thank </em>you? </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Fuck</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> you-\u201d Gavin chokes it out, all of a sudden furious and terrified and trembling so fucking bad, his fists are grasping at the fabric of R.K\u2019s sleeve and there\u2019s a coiling, constricting weight in the pit of his stomach that makes him feel like he\u2019s about to be sick</span> <span class=\"s2\">- \u201c<em>Fuck</em> you</span> <span class=\"s1\">, you don\u2019t get to do that shit, you\u2019re not a fuckin\u2019 hero, you could\u2019ve\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo, fuck you! </span> <span class=\"s2\">Fuck you,</span> <span class=\"s1\"> he shoulda shot you in the fucking head, then I wouldn\u2019t h-have to waste my fuckin\u2019 breath tellin\u2019 you what a fucking asshole you a-are\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c</span><em><span class=\"s2\">Gavin</span></em><span class=\"s1\">.\u201d R.K\u2019s hands cup his jaw, and Gavin realises he\u2019s being turned around; the man\u2019s body shielding him from view of the rest of the room. </span> <em><span class=\"s2\">Shit, shit, fuck,</span> <span class=\"s2\">no, no, not here, not now,</span> <span class=\"s2\">please, please don\u2019t, please</span></em> <span class=\"s1\"><em>,</em> Gavin hasn\u2019t had a panic attack so bad since Greensway and it\u2019s merciless and intense and his knees are about to buckle and his whole body\u2019s about to sink through the fucking floor, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">please not here, just stop, fucking stop, stop, stop, stop-</span> </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But R.K\u2019s there. This solid, warm presence in front of him, and until now Gavin\u2019s never been so thankful for the man\u2019s annoying, strait-laced fucking tone of voice. \u201cFocus on me, focus on your breathing. This will pass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin does breathe, does focus, but he focuses on the bullet wound instead; on the rhythmic flare of blue lights in the wires. The methodical glints are ironically soothing, considering they\u2019re what caused Gavin\u2019s fucking meltdown in the first place.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And he does begin to calm, slowly, horribly slowly, but steadily, and he\u2019s suddenly so, so stupidly grateful for R.K\u2019s height; for his body in between him and any prying eyes. And in a final moment of weakness, Gavin lets his forehead drop against R.K\u2019s uninjured shoulder, closing his eyes until breathing finally, <em>finally</em>, comes\u00a0</span> <span class=\"s2\">easier</span> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t fucking need you to protect me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUnfortunately, humans are not so easily fixed. The choice was simple. And I was happy to make it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin bites out a curse, so quiet and muffled against the android\u2019s jacket that he\u2019s not even sure what he says himself. \u201cThen I don\u2019t </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">want</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> you to, asshole. Don\u2019t ever fuckin\u2019 do it again.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K doesn\u2019t answer, nor does he resist when Gavin shoves him away. They walk to the car in silence, and Gavin doesn\u2019t have the energy to argue when R.K slides into the driver\u2019s seat and gestures for the keys.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They follow Hank and Chris back to Detroit, and if Gavin stands a little closer to R.K than necessary as they ride the elevator up to the DPD\u2019s interrogation rooms, then neither officer says anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe bullet didn\u2019t go deep.\u201d Connor\u2019s brows knit together as he surveys the damage. \u201cI should be able to remove it quite easily.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWell, stop just freaking standin\u2019 there then, hurry the fuck up.\u201d Gavin\u2019s been shot before; had a bullet lodged between bone and muscle and layers of skin, he knows how much it sucks. After the initial pain comes this itching, teeth-grinding urge to just claw the intrusion out yourself, with your bare hands if you have to.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He also knows that androids can\u2019t feel pain, he\u2019s not an idiot, but\u2026 still. He wants that bullet </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">gone</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They\u2019ve taken one of the empty interrogation rooms. The main lights hadn\u2019t been working, so they\u2019re on back-up power; these pathetic, dim, blue things on the ceiling panels that let off more of a glow than any kind of useful brightness. Though Gavin supposes they should count their blessings Connor doesn\u2019t need much light to be able to see anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K\u2019s perched on the table, thirium-stained jacket folded over the back of one of the chairs, and shirt unbuttoned halfway to reveal the jagged bullet wound just beneath his collarbone.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He looks calm as ever, of course. Unfazed, as Connor pokes around in his wires. It\u2019s a complete one-eighty to Gavin\u2019s tapping fingers and antsy idling around the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe should approach Captain Fowler about having more androids stationed here, for medical needs,\u201d Connor muses, thirium dripping down his knuckles as he nudges deeper into the wound. \u201cSomeone more qualified than me, at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut you can fix him, right?\u201d Gavin makes sure it sounds way more a warning than a question, and the way he's stood, leaning against the far wall with his shoulders hunched and arms folded, hopefully only enhances the effect. \u201cConnor\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable, Detective Reed,\u201d Connor interrupts, though his eyebrows are still furrowed in a manner that doesn\u2019t reassure Gavin. Like, </span> <span class=\"s2\">at all.</span><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0\u201cBut bear in mind, I was built for putting bullets </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">into</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> things. Not taking them out.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin feels the irrational desire to bang his head against the wall. \u201cDipshit, I swear to God\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere.\u201d Connor draws his fingers back, soaked in blue, with the bullet held between them. He drops it with a clatter into the metal plate he\u2019d swiped from a shelf on the way there, and then he begins to inspect the internal damage. \u201cThat actually wasn\u2019t too complicated.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em> <span class=\"s2\">Androids can\u2019t feel pain</span><span class=\"s1\">,</span> <span class=\"s2\"> he\u2019s fine,</span></em><span class=\"s1\">\u00a0Gavin reminds himself. But he fucking </span> <span class=\"s2\">swears</span> <span class=\"s1\"> that R.K\u2019s shoulders had lost some of their tightness the second the bullet was gone. Maybe he could feel it digging in there; no pain, but still an unwelcome invasion. Like a splinter or something.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective Reed.\u201d Gavin looks in Connor\u2019s direction, where the android\u2018s motioning him over. \u201cKeep R.K\u2019s injury in check. I need to find something to seal the damage with. If you see red instead of blue coming from inside,\u201d the android explains as Gavin cautiously treads to the table, \u201cthen shout for me. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhoa, whoa, hey, </span> <span class=\"s2\">Connor!\u201d</span> <span class=\"s1\"> Gavin starts panicking as the android turns and paces out of the room. \u201cConnor! Asshole, get </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">back here-\"</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But Connor\u2019s hasty footsteps only become distant, and Gavin curses under his breath when they disappear altogether. His eyes dart to R.K\u2019s wound. The methodical flickers and flashes from the internal wires are, as Connor\u2018d said, a deep and familiar blue.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin decides that glaring at them is the best approach, absolutely. As though his stern expression alone will keep them flaring that way.</span> <em> <span class=\"s2\"> Don\u2019t turn red, don\u2019t turn red, don\u2019t turn red.</span> </em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think he asked you to keep an eye merely as a precaution,\u201d R.K points out, his smile noticeable in his voice. \u201cI ran a diagnostic. My systems are in no danger.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh yeah, smartass? And what if your diagnostics were damaged, huh? What if your feedback\u2019s screwing you over,\u201d Gavin snaps back, gaze still obstinately fixed on the wound. \u201cWouldn\u2019t feel so clever then, would you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K doesn\u2019t retort, but Gavin knows he\u2019s amused, and probably arching one of those neat, thin eyebrows at him as well. Gavin\u2019s glare only deepens, and his focus only becomes more intent on the injury. The edge of R\u2019s fucking shirt is covering a corner of the wound and he can\u2019t <em>see</em>. Gavin hooks his index finger around the fabric before he can really consider it, and he tugs it to the side to expose the bullet hole entirely.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The tip of his thumb\u2019s resting against R.K\u2019s chest. Shit. Okay, didn\u2019t think that through. Gavin can\u2019t glean why it\u2019s such a shock to his own very vulnerable, very human system to suddenly have the knowledge that R.K is </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">warm</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">. Fuck, it\u2019s not like Gavin\u2019s never touched an android before; he knows thirium\u2018s\u00a0pumped round androids\u2019 vitals like\u00a0regular blood, he fucking </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">knows</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">\u00a0they're as warm as any human. But it does occur to him, creeping into the forefront of his mind, that the shock seems to boil down to the simple fact that it\u2019s </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">R.K</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> perched in front of him. It\u2019s </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">R.K</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> that his fingers are pressing against; it's\u00a0</span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">R.K\u2019s</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> shirt he\u2019s just pulled aside; it's\u00a0</span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">R.K</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> whose hair is ruffled and who\u2019s wounded and who\u2019s looking down at him with this fond, </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">soft</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> expression that Gavin can never get enough of in the rare moments it appears on his polished fucking face.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d R\u2019s voice is painfully gentle as well. Tender, as though Gavin\u2019s the one who\u2019s been injured.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know that, dumbass.\u201d All of it, the lights, the flare of R\u2019s wires, his warmth, all give Gavin this insane, intense moment of bravery, and he presses his palm flat against R.K\u2019s bare skin. \u201cI know you\u2019re made of strong stuff. I don't... fuck, I just\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The doors slide open, and Connor returns. Gavin pulls back quickly, as though he\u2019s been burned.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He retakes his place at the side of the room, as the android gets to play nurse and patch up his patient bit by bit. Connor works quickly, and the tension in Gavin\u2019s shoulders and chest eases tremendously when the bullet wound\u2018s no longer visible.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As R.K closes the button underneath his collar, Anderson sticks his head in from the corridor. \u201cHow\u2019s things goin\u2019?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Connor gives a nod. \u201cAll done, Lieutenant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hank hears him well and clear, but he still seems to give R.K a look over. One of the old man\u2019s habits, Gavin knows; if Hank doesn\u2019t see something with his own two eyes, he won\u2019t let the matter rest. \u201cGonna be all right, kid? You all good?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI am fully operational; nothing was in urgent need of repairs.\u201d R.K shoots Hank a little smile, and Gavin preens a little, just a little, to see that it\u2019s nowhere near as soft he\u2019d seen when they were alone. \u201cYour concern is appreciated, though unneeded, Lieutenant, I assure you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJesus, he sounds like you did months back,\u201d Hank says to Connor, and he scoffs between both androids. \u201cBein\u2019 a stick in the mud run in the family?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Connor\u2019s head tilts, and Gavin sees R.K\u2019s mouth close into a thin line; fucking </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">telltale</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> signs that the plastic wonder brothers are about to argue against the Lieutenant\u2019s flawed logic. Gavin knows </span> <span class=\"s2\">that</span> <span class=\"s1\"> could last for-freaking-ever.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAll right, ladies,\u201d he interrupts, barely making it as Connor opens his mouth to speak. \u201cR\u2019s got an interrogation to go to, everybody get the fuck out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI thought </span> <span class=\"s2\">you</span> <span class=\"s1\"> were interrogatin\u2019 the suspect, Reed?\u201d Hank asks, brows high in surprise as they file out into the hallway. \u201cShit, she requested an android?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cD\u2019you really blame her,\u201d Gavin retorts. \u201cIf I had the choice, I\u2019d rather be questioned by a human. Y\u2019know, someone like me? Makes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Anderson gives a grunt of agreement after thinking it through. \u201cYou got a point.\u201d Yeah, Gavin fucking knows, he\u2019s a pro. \u201cSuppose it\u2019s a comfort, if nothin\u2019 else. Havin\u2019 someone that might understand you better.\u201d He glimpses back at R.K, who walks beside Connor with near perfect synchronicity. \u201cYou ever done an interrogation before?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K levels him with an unimpressed look. Gavin smirks, knowing the exact amount of sass that\u2019s about to fire Anderson\u2019s way.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLieutenant, you remember what the RK series is designed for, yes? It was my belief that you and RK800 worked together on the Ortiz case last year. Was his performance not enough to instil some faith in our capabilities?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hank has the grace to look sheepish, as he turns his gaze forward again. \u201cI see bein\u2019 a smartass runs in the family, too,\u201d he grumbles, before stopping outside room 025. \u201cThe suspect\u2019s next door,\u201d he tells R.K, pressing his hand against the keypad of the observation room to gain access. \u201cTry not to let her self-destruct.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAs you say, Lieutenant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey,\u201d Gavin takes R.K\u2019s arm as he moves to enter the interrogation room. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That smile, the one that makes Gavin\u2019s knees want to hit the floor, makes its first appearance of the day. \u201cThank you, Gavin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K strides through the door, and Gavin steps into the neighbouring room, leaning against the one-sided window beside Hank and Connor, to keep an eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He has a disconcerting wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as he regards the ST300; sitting where Carlos Ortiz\u2019s android had</span> <span class=\"s1\"> six months back, cuffs locking her wrists to the table and looking just as frightened. Guess things haven\u2019t changed in the city as much as people had thought, when it came to androids.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K\u2018s poised opposite her; hands laced together atop the table, legs neatly crossed beneath. \u201cMadeline. Your chosen name, or the one Mr. Groves gave you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMichael gave it to me. When I first became his assistant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat was around five years ago?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd how long have you been having sexual relations with your employer?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin watches Madeline blink in surprise, and she casts an embarrassed glance at the one-way mirror. \u201cH-how\u2026 how did you know that\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cMr. Groves was willing to shoot Detective Reed and myself in order to prevent us from locating you,\u201d R.K answers. \u201cI doubt any human would go to such lengths for a simple secretary, let alone an android.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin hears Hank huff from beside him. \u201cOk, I admit it. Your boy\u2019s good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNines is equipped with the same software as I am, Lieutenant,\u201d Connor points out, not looking away from the interrogation room. \u201cHis proficiency shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. As he mentioned before, this is the kind of work we were built for.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin side-eyes the android. </span> <span class=\"s2\">\u201cNines?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA nickname.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI already got him his name, smartass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m aware. But I\u2019ve learned that personalised nicknames are often applied\u00a0as a sign of friendship. I rather like using them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s that small, twitchy smile on Connor\u2019s face again, and Gavin makes a show of rolling his eyes with an annoyance he doesn\u2019t feel. Once upon a time, if he was held at gunpoint, </span> <span class=\"s2\">maybe</span> <span class=\"s1\">, he might have admitted to finding Connor\u2019s smiles cute. Paired with those dumb freckles and the jawline and the Bambi doe-eyes. But now, of course, there's blue eyes and confident smirks and long legs, and ever since R.K\u2013</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin cuts the thought off there. He really doesn\u2019t need to get into </span> <span class=\"s2\">that</span><span class=\"s1\">, of all things, right now. That\u2019s a problem for future Gavin, present Gavin\u2019s fucking busy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUnless I\u2019m wrong, Madeline?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The ST300\u2019s shoulders are hunched in discomfort, but she concedes. \u201cNo. We are... intimate with one another. For over two years now, and long, long after Michael and Lydia\u2019s divorce.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAnd has Mr. Groves ever expressed a desire to reconnect with his ex-wife? Perhaps that\u2019s why you broke into her house and assaulted her on April thirteenth,\u201d R.K continues, cold in the face of the ST300\u2019s shock. \u201cPeople have done far worse for the sake of passion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo! No, I would never\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere\u2019s no point in delaying the inevitable,\u201d R.K interrupts. \u201cWe already have Ms Groves\u2019s statement, and there was considerable evidence placing you at her house that night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin feels himself frown. There was </span> <span class=\"s2\">no</span> <span class=\"s1\"> evidence, besides a botched broken lock and the gash on Lydia Groves\u2019s arm...</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then he realises what R\u2019s doing. Since the revolution, specific laws regarding androids had been enforced, particularly involving android-related crime. One law, Madeline had already taken advantage of; androids accused of a crime could exercise their right to be questioned by another android, or at least have another android present in the room, for their own comfort if nothing else. Another law was that probing an android\u2019s memory without their consent was now highly illegal.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And since they don\u2019t know precisely what had occurred at Lydia Groves\u2019s house that night, R.K\u2018s coercing Madeline into allowing them to see the events for themselves.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cClever prick,\u201d Gavin mutters to himself, more than ready to see where this goes, before the door to the hallway slides open and Ben pokes his head in.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGavin\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIn the middle of somethin\u2019, fuck off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFowler wants to see you. Gotta sign the report for what happened at Michael Groves\u2019 house.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan it </span> <span class=\"s2\">wait?\u201d</span> <span class=\"s1\"> Gavin motions between himself and the one-sided mirror, \u201cWe\u2019re about to get a fuckin\u2019 confession here, Ben. Jesus.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI can stay to mediate,\u201d Hank says, reclining back in his chair. \u201cYour boy looks like he knows what he\u2019s doing. If anythin\u2019 happens, Connor\u2019ll come get you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin pushes away from the mirror, fingers curling to fists. \u201cFuck that! Fowler can fuckin\u2019 wait\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole, Reed, though I know how hard that idea must be for you,\u201d Hank adds, and Gavin barely restrains the urge to kick the chair legs out from under the man. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on your partner, it\u2019s under control. Go and see Jeffrey before he finally cracks and gives you a long overdue suspension.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin feels his jaw clench, ready to argue, but Ben and Hank and Connor are staring at him, and R\u2019s composed as ever behind the glass, and Gavin </span> <span class=\"s2\">really</span> <span class=\"s1\"> can\u2019t afford another disciplinary. Or a suspension.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He takes a breath through his nose, works his knuckles to loosen them, bites out a </span> <span class=\"s2\">\u201cFine,\u201d</span> <span class=\"s1\"> and marches past Hank. \u201cIf </span> <span class=\"s2\">anythin\u2019</span> <span class=\"s1\"> happens,\u201d he warns, and Hank\u2019s accepting wave is enough to lessen the force that Gavin grits his teeth with as he walks out into the hallway.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Ben follows him as far as his desk. Gavin takes the steps up to Fowler\u2019s office two at a time, and he doesn\u2019t even knock; just shoulders open the door and lets it slam behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe fuck, Fowler? Sendin\u2019 Ben to come fetch me, R\u2019s in the middle of a fuckin\u2019 interrogation, this couldn\u2019t have waited like half an hour-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t give me your attitude today, Reed, I\u2019m not in the mood. And for the last goddamn time, it\u2019s </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">Captain</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">.\u201d Fowler glares at him over the brim of whatever paperwork he was looking over before Gavin made his grand entrance . \u201cI\u2018m well aware you were in an interrogation, do not mock my intelligence. I also know Hank and Connor are there too, and you don\u2019t need three fucking people to mediate. Need to talk to you about something, anyway.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust give me the fuckin\u2019 report, then,\u201d Gavin gripes, reaching out for the paper. \u201cBen said I just gotta sign it\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019ll get to that,\u201d Fowler interrupts, holding up his free hand to silence him. \u201cI need to talk to you about the RK900. Since it started working here\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cR.K.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Fowler raises a brow, and Gavin crosses his arms tightly over his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He can feel the flush on his neck, and he knows he\u2019s biting the inside of his mouth. But he also feels another surge of bravery, of stubbornness, and he presses on before they both turn tail and abandon him. \u201cHis name\u2019s R.K. And he ain\u2019t a fucking </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">it</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">, so quit callin\u2019 him that.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He expects another reprimand for talking back, but Fowler just lowers his gaze to read through something on the paper again, before setting it aside on the desk. He fixes Gavin with a solemn expression. Gavin doesn\u2019t fucking like it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSince R.K started working here, he\u2019s gotten some attention from other precincts. Even some special agencies. We already knew Connor\u2019s presence had increased public opinion these last few months,\u201d Fowler explains, standing to round the desk and sit on one corner, a little closer to Gavin. \u201cAnd now with Groves\u2019 case about to be closed, I assume attention\u2019s only gonna grow as far as public service androids are concerned.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gavin really does </span> <span class=\"s2\">not</span> <span class=\"s1\"> like the look on his Captain\u2019s face right now. \u201cYeah, and?\u201d He spares a glimpse to the piece of paper Fowler was holding. And he swears to fucking God that the room actually starts spinning when he spots the word\u00a0</span> <strong> <span class=\"s3\">FBI</span> </strong> <span class=\"s1\"> in bold, black letters. \u201cThe hell\u2019s this about?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe FBI\u2019s been following R.K\u2019s work. As a prototype like Connor, his position here was experimental, to see how things would work out\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSpit it out, Fowler,\u201d Gavin growls, patience out the window and halfway down the fucking street. \u201cWhat the hell do those assholes want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPerkins wants R.K with them.\u201d Fowler reaches over and retrieves the paper, handing it out to Gavin. \u201cSent us this, this morning. Never expected the man to request an android for the FBI, not after what happened during the revolution, but\u2026 well. Here we are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It feels like someone\u2019s stepping on his windpipe. Gavin tries to skim through the transfer request, but phrases like </span> <span class=\"s2\">valuable asset</span> <span class=\"s1\"> and </span> <span class=\"s2\">advanced prototype</span> <span class=\"s1\"> and Richard Perkins\u2019s squiggly fucking signature at the bottom of the page is making it pretty shitting difficult for Gavin not to crumple the paper up in his fist.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPerkins is coming in sometime this week to discuss a possible transfer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin scoffs, but it comes out choked. \u201cWhat, and R gets no fuckin\u2019 say in this? You\u2019re just gonna <em>hand</em> him over like a goddamn\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDon\u2019t give me that, Reed, of course the android gets a fucking say,\u201d Fowler cuts across him again, fingers rubbing his temples like he\u2019s trying to soothe an oncoming headache. Or a current<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>headache; maybe Gavin\u2019s already given him one. \u201cR.K will be involved in the discussion. I just thought you should know as soon as, since you\u2019ve been the one working with him,\u201d the Captain adds. \u201cI mean, Jesus Christ, Gavin, a few weeks ago you were begging me to reassign you. I thought you'd\u00a0be thrilled about this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Maybe Gavin would have been. But as Fowler just said, that was a </span><span class=\"s2\">few</span> <span class=\"s2\">fucking</span> <span class=\"s2\">weeks ago</span><span class=\"s1\">. \u201cYeah, well I\u2019m not. Dick Perkins and the whole FBI can kiss my fuckin\u2019 ass. R ain\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat\u2019s the android\u2019s decision. Not yours,\u201d Fowler says sharply, \u201cand not anyone else\u2019s, as you\u2019ve made abundantly clear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin\u2019s fingernails are digging into his palms; any harder and he\u2019ll proobaly draw blood, but the slight sting\u2019s the only thing keeping him from throwing Fowler\u2019s desk chair through the glass walls. \u201cWhat if he chooses to stay, then what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThen he\u2019ll stay.\u201d Fowler says, as though it\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the room, and with the way the city\u2019s going at the minute, we need all the good officers we can get our hands on. </span> <span class=\"s2\">If</span> <span class=\"s1\"> he decides to stay,\u201d he stresses. \u201cIt\u2019s a good position Perkins is offering, Gavin. R.K would be an idiot to turn it down. Anyone would be.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin doesn\u2019t answer. And after a few seconds of heavy, angry silence, Fowler sighs and files through another mound of papers on the desk. He pulls one out and pushes it at Gavin, \u201cThe major incident report for Michael Groves\u2019 house. Read it, sign it, and get the fuck out. I got a million other things to deal with.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When Gavin trudges out of the office, snarling and scowling and feeling like something in his chest is about to shatter, R.K\u2018s waiting for him at their desks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Lieutenant mentioned you\u2019d been called away,\u201d he says in way of greeting, glancing to the transparent walls of Fowler\u2019s office. \u201cNothing too serious, I hope?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">R.K\u2019s still got blue splatters all over his jacket, and the tear in his shirt from Groves\u2019 bullet is still there, and his hair still isn\u2019t as neat as it usually is and Gavin suddenly has this clawing, overwhelming </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">need</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> to fist his hands in it and pull the android down to his eye level.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was nothin\u2019,\u201d he brushes off instead. \u201cReport for the shooting. Could\u2019ve waited til we were finished.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d R.K begins, and he leans down to load up something on Gavin\u2019s terminal. How the android has his password, Gavin has no idea and he doesn\u2019t waste his breath asking. Dumb things like that don\u2019t tend to surprise him anymore. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should see, Detective.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShe confess?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNot quite. She allowed me access to her memory, and I found out what happened on April thirteenth at Ms Groves\u2019 residence.\u201d R.K places his palm over Gavin\u2019s terminal, and the screen freezes and fizzes for several seconds before a video file sporting R.K\u2019s serial number opens. \u201cI believe this sheds light on the gaps in Ms Groves\u2019 statement. Madeline is, in fact, completely innocent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLike we thought. So, what, she never broke in?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJust watch, Detective.\u201d Gavin leans beside R.K to get a closer look at the screen. \u201cOnce you have, I expect we\u2019ll have to pay Ms Groves a second visit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">***</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSo, Detective.\u201d Lydia Groves is wearing the same string of pearls, the same style of dress suit, only in green instead of white, and this time around, Gavin feels cold irritation clench in his gut when she casts her disapproving expression over R.K for the third time since she let them inside. \u201cMight I ask what brings you and your </span> <span class=\"s2\">android</span> <span class=\"s1\">, back here with absolutely no warning from Captain Fowler?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re following up on somethin\u2019,\u201d Gavin grates out, as politely as he can manage. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda serious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He takes a sip of coffee, having accepted one this time around just for something to do with his hands. It\u2019s in a fucking china cup, and it\u2018s weak as shit, and she put about three sugars in it, and Gavin would give his right fucking <em>leg</em> for a cup of the shitty precinct coffee instead. Preferably one that R\u2019s made.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe brought in your ex-husband and his android,\u201d Gavin continues, instead of voicing his complaints. \u201cMichael Groves is goin\u2019 on trial for shooting my partner there,\u201d he adds, gesturing in R.K\u2019s direction, where the android is leaning in the doorframe.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The coffee actually tastes slightly better paired with the sight of Ms Groves\u2019 horrified expression. \u201cOn trial\u2013? For shooting\u2013\u201d She stares at R.K, who offers her a thin smile in answer. \u201cMichael can\u2019t be on trial! He wasn\u2019t even involved in the assault, I told you! It was all his android\u2019s\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c</span> <span class=\"s2\">Madeline</span> <span class=\"s1\"> is totally innocent,\u201d Gavin cuts across her, dropping the china cup back into it\u2019s plate with a harsh little </span> <span class=\"s2\">clink</span> <span class=\"s1\">, and putting his boots up on the coffee table. Ms Groves looks nearabouts traumatised by the display, and Gavin makes sure to slouch a little more just for the hell of it. \u201cWe know she never broke into your house. You\u2019ve been lyin\u2019 this whole time.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cLying?!\u201d Ms. Groves makes a valiant show of looking insulted. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd! There\u2013 The lock was broken, Detective Reed, you saw it yourself! And <em>this</em>,\u201d she rolls up her sleeve to reveal the cut; healing but still visible along the side of her forearm. \u201cWhat reason would I have to lie\u2013?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m glad you ask.\u201d R.K straightens up, and he takes a few paces until he\u2019s standing in the centre of the kitchen. \u201cThank you once again for allowing us back into your charming home, Ms Groves. I should be able to reconstruct the scene much clearer here than at the precinct.\u201d He looks to Gavin, \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me to take point, Detective?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin sweeps a hand over the kitchen. \u201cDo your thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">R.K laces his hands behind his back, and begins his analysis. \u201cMadeline did not break in, Ms Groves. Because you invited her in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRidiculous! I won\u2019t be questioned in my <em>own home</em>.\u201d Ms Groves gapes at them both from her place on the couch. \u201cYou, both of you, leave this instant\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAfter your divorce, and Michael Groves\u2019s rising success, you became envious of his new relationship with his assistant. Madeline. So you hatched a plan.\u201d R.K moves over to the back door, inspecting the lock. \u201cStage a break-in, stage an assault, and frame Madeline for the crime. After all, who would believe an android over a human? Even with the new laws put into place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cDetective Reed,\u00a0</span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">shut</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> this thing up\u2013\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou invited Madeline here as a show of peace on April thirteenth; a chance to talk things through and move forwards, which she readily accepted,\u201d R continues. \u201cShe entered here quite legally; through the front door, in fact. I have her memory of that night uploaded. It all becomes a little difficult to follow, however, after you began breaking things in order to stage the attack. Emotional shock is never good for an android\u2019s processors, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe couldn\u2019t see anythin\u2019 after you smashed up the counters,\u201d Gavin adds. \u201cShe was makin\u2019 dinner, right?\u201d he asks R.K, getting to his feet and joining him near the oven. \u201cI saw steam from the stove before the image from Madeline\u2019s memory started cutting out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCorrect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThen she started tearin\u2019 the place apart,\u201d Gavin continues, treading along the outskirts of the kitchen counters, recalling vague, static images of broken plates and torn curtains flashing across the screen of his terminal back at the DPD. \u201cBut that alone wouldn\u2019t have been evidence enough. You needed somethin\u2019 else,\u201d he continues to Ms Groves over his shoulder, as he comes to a stop beside the stand of knives. \u201cI was wonderin\u2019 why the cut was on your left arm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAn astute observation, Detective.\u201d There\u2019s that proud, impressed little note to R.K\u2019s voice, and it gives Gavin all the go ahead he needs.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you\u2019d gotten that injury in self-defence, it\u2019d be on your right arm. You\u2019re right-handed,\u201d Gavin indicts, taking in the gash on Ms Groves\u2019 left arm. \u201cOn instinct, you\u2019d raise your dominant arm to fight off an attack. Madeline didn\u2019t do that to you. You\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid it to yourself,\u201d R.K finishes. \u201cIndeed. The same way you damaged the back-door\u2019s lock, to make it appear as though there was an intrusion. You were trying to point the evidence away from yourself and toward Madeline, in the hope that she would be arrested. What was your end goal?\u201d R.K presses on, drawing closer to Ms Groves, who by now has stood and is staring, dazed and dismayed, between them. \u201cTo see Madeline behind bars? To win your ex-husband back? Or was it plain and simple hatred for an innocent android? I doubt you foresaw Michael Groves protecting her, however.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cShe\u2019s a <em>machine!\u201d</em></span> <span class=\"s1\"> Ms. Groves splutters, finally finding her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s just a </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">machine</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\">! Michael just needed an assistant for work, he wasn\u2019t supposed to <em>fall </em></span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">in love</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> with her! He left me for a fucking machine, and now he\u2019s going to <em>jail</em> for a machine! It should be Madeline, it should be that </span> <em> <span class=\"s2\">thing</span> </em> <span class=\"s1\"> being arrested,\u201d she spits at R.K. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even feel anything! None of you do!\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cShut your fuckin\u2019 mouth before I shut it for you.\u201d Gavin steps between her and R.K. \u201cLydia Groves, you\u2019re under arrest for illicitly assaulting an android and obstructing the course of justice. As a witness, Madeline has given us evidence supporting her statement, and it\u2018ll be used in her defence against you in court.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Gavin\u2019s still not satisfied when he locks the handcuffs around her wrists, so he adds, \u201cAnd if you talk to my partner like that again, I\u2019m gonna have you locked up for the rest of your life.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He technically can\u2019t do that, but it\u2019s worth the threat just to see the horror in Ms Groves\u2019 eyes, and hear R.K\u2019s soft chuckle before they begin the car ride back to Detroit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you arrested the ex-wife, huh? The real suspect was a human all along.\u201d Hank doesn\u2019t sound surprised. His tone\u2019s full of its usual, comforting cynicism. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing with the architect?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s serving time for firing at an officer. We tried to get him on intent to kill, but he\u2019s one of the rich assholes, y\u2019know? Good lawyers, good bail, all that shit,\u201d Gavin adds, bitter, from his perch on the edge of Anderson\u2019s desk. \u201cDoubt he\u2019ll get more than a few fuckin\u2019 years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the android? Madeline?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s off scot-free, poor kid didn\u2019t do anythin\u2019 wrong. R said she\u2019s taking over Groves\u2019s company while he\u2019s on the inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hank hums, then shakes his head. \u201cStartin\u2019 to feel sorry for these androids, y\u2019know. Stuck on this planet with us screw-ups.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, <em>startin\u2019 </em>to,\u201d Gavin scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been soft on \u2018em forever. Or don\u2019t you remember letting robot Fido trail you around like a fuckin\u2019 Jack Russell? Even before the revolution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, okay. Sure. Like you can fuckin\u2019 talk, right, Reed.\u201d Gavin knows he\u2019s made a huge mistake, opening his big fucking mouth. He <em>knows</em> that gleam in Hank\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot like you\u2019ve had a raging hard-on for Mr Turtleneck since the second he walked in here or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your fuckin\u2019 voice down,\u201d Gavin hisses, wary and way too conscious of himself as he glances across the bullpen. R.K\u2019s mercifully too far away to overhear; stood talking with Connor over by Chris and Chen\u2019s desks. \u201cAnd no, I haven\u2019t, not that it\u2019s any of your business, <em>Hank</em>. R\u2019s an arrogant prick, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMatch made in heaven, then.\u201d Hank snorts when Gavin elbows him. \u201cCool it, Reed. Don\u2019t pretend you can\u2019t handle a little playground teasing. Besides,\u201d he says, regarding the pair of androids thoughtfully, \u201cI reckon he likes you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin scowls. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s not interested. <em>Don\u2019t ask, Reed, just live and let live.</em> He chews on the inside of his lip.</p>\n<p>Then he caves, because his impulse control has never been up to par. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hank shrugs, reclined back in his desk chair like he's Gavin's judge, jury and executioner rolled into one. \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t quit you yet, for one. And you ain\u2019t exactly the <em>nicest</em> guy in the world, so I guess that\u2019s sayin\u2019 something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Gavin mutters. His brows furrow when he looks back at R.K. He watches as he and Connor take one another\u2019s forearm, the synthetic skin thawing away to reveal the white shell of their casing beneath. \u201cThe fuck are they doin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell knows,\u201d Hank answers, with the tone of a man who\u2019s been privy to the same weird shit for a while now and no longer cares to know the details. \u201cThink it\u2019s an interface thing, like sharing memories without having to probe them. Somethin\u2019 like that. Connor tried to explain it once, but I switched off. It\u2019s all just a load of software and coding nonsense, I can\u2019t listen to that crap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gavin agrees distantly. He\u2019s all of a sudden heavily distracted by the white, porcelain-like texture of R\u2019s arm, as the skin coating spreads away under Connor\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>Connor\u2019s doing that blinky thing he does whenever he has to make a wireless report or connects with something that makes his LED start to flash. R.K just has a slightly vague look in his eyes, like he\u2019s noticed something in the distance he\u2019s trying to focus on.</p>\n<p>Gavin plunges back into reality when he clocks Hank scrutinising him. He doesn\u2019t give the old man the satisfaction of looking at him, though. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBein\u2019 with an android ain\u2019t so bad, you know. Not that different.\u201d</p>\n<p>The shock of Anderson\u2019s <em>almost</em>-confession forces Gavin\u2019s head snap around to him. Gavin had presumed, of course, more so as time went on \u2013 Connor and Hank weren\u2019t always as subtle as they thought, and Gavin liked to think he was a good enough detective to have picked out all the signs. But actually\u00a0<em>hearing</em> Hank say it aloud is weirdly jarring. And unexpected as hell.</p>\n<p>And worst of all, it makes a tiny, treacherous ember of hope start to smoulder in Gavin\u2019s chest. \u201cThe fuck are you tellin\u2019 me that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hank shrugs again, but he\u2019s cornering Gavin with this sympathetic, <em>knowing</em> look. \u201cJust sayin\u2019. Might not hurt to buck up and lose some of that pride of yours, give things a fair chance. Never know. Might be the best choice you ever make.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Gavin\u2019s brain can even catch up with all this and muster a response, the little\u00a0<em>click-clack</em>\u00a0of Connor\u2019s shoes warns him that it\u2019s no longer safe to talk about this shit. Hank nudges Gavin until he\u2019s standing, in order to make room at the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations on closing the case, Detective Reed,\u201d Connor says, taking his seat opposite the Lieutenant. \u201cNines told me you were the one who pieced together the evidence and found Lydia Groves guilty of staging the assault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some snide comeback is about to leave Gavin\u2019s mouth, instinctive and welcome in the face of Gavin\u2019s confusion and unease over his and Anderson\u2019s little heart-to-heart. But then Hank catches his eye, and everything the man just pointed out throbs behind Gavin\u2019s temples, and for once in his fucking life, he reigns in his tongue before it runs away with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeam effort,\u201d he answers instead, though he can\u2019t look Connor in the eye while he does. Baby steps. \u201cR\u2019s a good cop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Connor fucking\u00a0<em>beams</em>. It\u2019s horrifyingly sunny and adorable. He doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the sight of that, or the way Hank looks at the android when he does it, that makes Gavin want to throw up slightly. He chalks it up to both, and makes himself scarce before he has to be part of the scene for any longer.</p>\n<p>He shirks down at his own desk with a shudder. \u201cI swear those two are gonna give me fuckin\u2019 cavities,\u201d he gripes to R.K, who raises a questioning eyebrow in the pair\u2019s direction. \u201cSeriously, shitbird, you should\u2019ve seen Anderson before Connor got here, that fugly smile on his face never saw the light of day. Now I gotta look at twenty-four-seven.\u201d He can\u2019t seem to manage to put any bite into his tone, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard of the Lieutenant\u2019s previous reputation, he seems considerably happier now,\u201d R remarks. \u201cEight cares about him very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin darts his gaze sideways, looking at anything that\u2019s an inanimate object and not the android\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say sappy shit like that,\u201d he mutters. \u201cAnd <em>Eight?</em> Seriously? You\u2019re doin\u2019 the whole nickname thing too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned that personalised nicknames are often applied as a sign of friendship. I rather like using them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, okay, don\u2019t do that, you fuckin\u2019 creep,\u201d Gavin warns, disturbed and side-eying the android suspiciously. \u201cConnor said that to me word for word, how the hell\u2013\u201d He cuts himself off when he sees R.K\u2019s conceited little smile. \u201c<em>Asshole</em>. You fuckin\u2019 knew he said that to me. What, smartass, you think you can freak me out or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d R.K retorts, all blue eyes and self-satisfaction. \u201cAnd it seems to have worked.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin can\u2019t help watching him this time, as R glances around the station; taking in their colleagues, the desks, the glass walls of the office.</p>\n<p>He grants Gavin one of those small, genuine smiles of his. \u201cThe case has been closed. An overall successful month, barring a few minor setbacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Gavin smirks, \u201clike bullying me on your first day of school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to say getting shot at Michael Groves\u2019 house. But I suppose an apology may be in order for our first meeting,\u201d R.K muses, before his smile turns significantly shittier. \u201cOn your end, I mean. You were being rather rude, so I feel\u00a0<em>my</em>\u00a0reaction was completely justified.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrick,\u201d Gavin mutters, but lets himself grin. He couldn\u2019t stop it even if he\u2019d bothered to try.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Plastic</em>\u00a0prick, I believe you said. You do realise that we\u2019re not actually made out of plastic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what you\u2019re made out of, you\u2019re still a prick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still rather rude,\u201d R.K says with an obviously feigned sigh. \u201cIt seems neither of us has changed much over the course of our partnership, then. A pity. Though I suppose\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>fuck</em>.\u201d Gavin stares at the entrance, not registering that he\u2019s cut R.K off as he catches sight of Perkins. Fuck, fuck, fuck. He watches the son of a bitch, as snotty and self-righteous as Gavin remembers him, try to make his way across the station before he\u2019s stopped by their security to fill out a visitor\u2019s form. \u201cShit. <em>Shit</em>,\u201d Gavin hisses. His conversation with Fowler is suddenly a very solid intrusion to just about every part of his brain. \u201cFucking shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt Agent Perkins\u2019s presence here is the cause for such colourful language, Detective,\u201d R.K says dryly, also regarding the man. Perkins tries to flash his FBI badge at the officers to avoid the paperwork. \u201cThough no one else seems particularly thrilled about him being here, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Perkins reluctantly accepts a visitor\u2019s pass, and he walks by their desks, shooting a shitty little wink at Gavin as he passes. The prick\u2019s eyes linger for far too long on R, as though he\u2019s a fucking prize at a vanity fair. Gavin feels his fingers twitch towards his gun.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn second thought, curse away,\u201d R.K concedes, an unimpressed expression clouding his face as he observes Perkins climbing the stairs and entering Fowler\u2019s office. \u201cHe\u2019s still as much of a shit as last time.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, it crashes properly over Gavin then; hard and without any pity. It\u2019s only been a month, and this could already be the last time he sees R.K. It could be the last time he talks with him, shit-talks him, the last time he hears that polished voice and that fucking chuckle that makes something in Gavin\u2019s stomach start doing backflips, the last time he sees those cold eyes start to thaw whenever Gavin manages to say something that particularly amuses him, the last time he actually feels like he has a <em>partner</em> in the DPD, for once in his fucking life, who\u00a0<em>gets him</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>accepts him,</em>\u00a0for some fucking reason. Gavin suddenly can\u2019t fucking bear it, pride be damned.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck pride</em>, Pulp Fiction\u2019s Marcellus Wallace scoffs at him in his head.\u00a0<em>Pride only hurts, it never helps</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K\u2019s head tilts in Gavin\u2019s direction, like his entire attention\u2019s been pulled toward him with just those two words. \u201cDetective?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Gavin curses himself for not knowing the right words, for not knowing how to handle it, for not being fucking good or prepared enough for this shit, but there\u2019s no <em>time</em> anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get called in there, okay,\u201d Gavin jerks his head towards Fowler\u2019s office, \u201cand Perkins is gonna offer you a sweet fuckin\u2019 deal. And the smart thing to do is accept and never take a second fuckin\u2019 look at this place, and I know that. I know, but just\u2026 don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDetective, what is\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t, just\u2026 just <em>stay</em>.\u201d Gavin\u2019s grabbed his wrist. His jacket\u2019s soft and the skin beneath is warm through the fabric, and Gavin can see Fowler and Perkins talking behind the glass walls out of the corner of his eye. \u201cYou got a choice, it\u2019s obviously your fuckin\u2019 choice, and I get that, and that\u2019s <em>fine</em>. But I\u2026 I want you to stay. I want you to stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K\u2019s reaching to take his hand when Fowler ducks his head out from the door and calls across the bullpen.</p>\n<p>\u201cR.K, get in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The android stays where he is for a few seconds, processing whatever he sees on Gavin\u2019s face. Hope? Embarrassment? The way too late realisation that he\u2019d trade pretty much anything right now if it meant that Perkins didn\u2019t get his slimy, fucking hands on the first partner Gavin\u2019s ever wanted to see stay? Gavin has no idea, and he doesn\u2019t have the chance to fucking ask.</p>\n<p>He watches, with a cruel kind of tightness all over him, as R.K stands and strides up the stairs into the Captain\u2019s office. There\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s staying to watch the meeting. The last thing he needs to fucking see is that triumphant, shitty smirk on Perkins\u2019s face when R.K accepts his offer of a transfer, because then Gavin really will get suspended for something. Knocking an FBI agent flat, for sure.</p>\n<p>He grabs his jacket instead, and just leaves. He just gets the fuck out. Ignores Connor\u2019s curiosity, ignores Anderson\u2019s, \u201cThe fuck you goin\u2019, Reed?\u201d and storms into the elevator; rides it down to street level while the fucking speakers fitted into the ceiling drone classical music at him;\u00a0<em>the notes</em>\u00a0<em>methodical</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>the structure</em>\u00a0<em>precise,</em> mocking Gavin the whole way down.</p>\n<p>The DPD\u2019s entrance doors glide open, and Gavin walks out into a bluster of wind and the early afternoon chill.</p>\n<p>He barely walks down the street. He just needs to be somewhere\u00a0<em>else</em>\u00a0besides that fucking office. He slumps down on one of the benches near the precinct. \u201cFuck this,\u201d he mutters to himself, too loudly apparently. An old lady with a dachshund shoots him a dirty look as she walks by.</p>\n<p>He ignores her, takes out his phone to distract himself when he sees a text from Hank, and three from Chen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>-----------------------------\u00a0\u00a0</em>Wednesday 24<sup>th</sup>\u00a0May, 2039 (PM)<em>\u00a0 -----------------------------</em></p>\n<p><strong><u>Lt.

Not that he\u2019d admit it in a million years, but he was really going to miss it. He\u2019d never met someone he liked doing this with so fucking much; talk about his interests, waiting around on his couch in front of the TV, with Mia on his lap and his knee bouncing in anticipation for the next buzz of his phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><u>R.K</u></strong><br><em>(21:56)</em><br>They\u2019re using these samurai swords completely<br>incorrectly.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(21:56)</em><br>I\u2019m so done with you rn</p>\n<p><strong><u>R.K</u></strong><br><em>(21:57)</em><br>You\u2019d expect after all her supposed years of<br>training, she would at least be able to hold a sword<br>properly.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(21:58)</em><br>I hate you</p>\n<p><strong><u>R.K</u></strong><br><em>(21:58)</em><br>: )</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(21:59)</em><br>jesus f christ I hate you</p>\n<p><em>(22:15)</em><br>movie over?</p>\n<p><strong>R.K</strong><br><em>(22:15)</em><br>Yes.

It\u2019s something that all androids seem to be equipped with, for some fucking reason. And without the jacket, without the blue triangle or the\u00a0<strong>android</strong>\u00a0letters in bold print, there\u2019s only the LED reminding Gavin that R\u2019s an android at all. Since the revolution, the differences between them and humans seem to be diminishing all the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I sit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin shrugs, stiff and hurt and trying to look like he doesn\u2019t give as many fucks as he actually does. But R.K takes it as permission. He perches beside him on the bench, back ramrod straight and palms flat against his thighs.</p>\n<p>The android doesn\u2019t speak again, and Gavin knows that he\u2019s giving him space. Keeping him company,\u00a0<em>checking up</em>\u00a0on him but not forcing him to talk. R does it all the time when they\u2019re alone. It\u2019s annoying. It\u2019s thoughtful. It\u2019s kind. And shit, Gavin is really, <em>really</em> going to fucking miss him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, what I said before,\u201d he begins, rubbing a hand over his face. He\u2019s tired, he\u2019s so goddamn tired, and he just wants to get this over with as quickly as possible. What\u2019s the point in dragging it out and making it hurt more. \u201cJust forget about it, you guys won your freedom and all that shit. I shouldn\u2019t have a say in what you do, don\u2019t even know why I said it. You\u2019ll do fine in the FBI,\u201d he adds. It hurts like a bitch but he knows it\u2019s the truth. \u201cProbably put all those other assholes to shame, \u2018specially Perkins.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K hums. \u201cYes, I would,\u201d he says, fucking humble as ever, and Gavin manages a weak scoff in response. \u201cI have declined his offer, however, so I suppose we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a jolt, a surge of sudden and rousing disbelief, and Gavin slowly lowers his hands to look at him. \u201cYou declined?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI declined.\u201d R.K cocks his head, as though confused by Gavin\u2019s shock. But there\u2019s that barely-there smile, curving at the corners of his mouth, and Gavin\u2019s heart is going to fucking <em>burst</em>. \u201cRather adamantly, in fact. I do not think Agent Perkins was pleased.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2013\u201d Gavin\u2019s attention is abruptly drawn to the DPD\u2019s entrance, as Perkins marches through the doors, expression like he\u2019s just had something forcibly inserted where the sun doesn\u2019t shine. He storms to his car, pauses when he spots Gavin and R.K on the bench. Gavin battles the urge to flip the man off, because he\u2019s not <em>that</em> childish. Perkins spits something under his breath as he wrenches his car door open and slams it behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Not pleased?</em>\u00a0R, he looks ready to commit fuckin\u2019 genocide, what did you <em>say</em> to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he offered me a rather comfortable position in the FBI, as you\u2019d kindly warned,\u201d R.K explains. \u201cAnd I took a phrase from your book in response.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>R\u2019s smile widens into something dry and conceited and\u00a0<em>amazing</em>. \u201cI told him to go fuck himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin throws his head back and laughs. He can\u2019t help it, and it feels so good that it starts to hurt, and R\u2019s laughing with him, and everything, every single thing in that moment, is just <em>right</em>. \u201cFuckin\u2019 maniac. D\u2019you know how much FBI douchebags get paid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no need for a pay rise,\u201d R.K assures, watching Perkins\u2019s car speed away with a contently triumphant expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, not even to upkeep that fancy apartment of yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly affordable on my current salary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin shakes his head. \u201cR\u2026 what the <em>fuck</em>.\u201d Seriously, his heart\u2019s actually about to fucking burst, and he\u2019s grinning like a moron and he\u00a0<em>doesn\u2019t give a shit</em>. \u201cThe FBI, you dumbass, you could\u2019ve\u2013\u201d He cuts himself off. It doesn\u2019t matter what the guy could\u2019ve done, it doesn\u2019t fucking matter. He\u2019s staying. He\u2019s\u00a0<em>staying</em>. \u201cWhat\u2019d Fowler say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Captain seemed accepting of my decision,\u201d R.K answers, sounding far too casual for how <em>happy</em>\u00a0Gavin feels right now. \u201cHe offered me a permanent position in the DPD as an alternative. So.\u201d The android tilts his head at Gavin, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know of any assholes in need of a partner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou been watchin\u2019 too many fucking movies.\u201d Gavin leans\u00a0back against the bench, giddy with relief, and he\u2019s convinced his smile\u2019s about to split his goddamn face in half. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I might know of someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which side of the bed you woke up on this mornin\u2019, Wilson, but it was the wrong fuckin\u2019 one,\u201d Gavin bites out, restraining the urge to knock his fellow officer upside the head. \u201cYou called us in to help you out on this, and I\u2019m givin\u2019 you a solid, grade A plan of attack, and it\u2019ll work, so stop fuckin\u2019 questioning me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, Reed, this is crazy,\u201d Wilson mutters in response, looking sceptically between Gavin and his partner.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in the lobby of a building on Third\u00a0Street, waiting to enter the AXIS lounge and get the dealers in their sights. Red Ice suppliers; a notorious group the DPD have been after for\u00a0<em>weeks</em>. A tipoff from one of the workers at the club told them the gang frequented the joint for business deals, and usually arrived by nine PM to stay for several hours.</p>\n<p>If the tipoff\u2019s solid, they could shut down a major drugs operation for good. Gavin doesn\u2019t see any fucking problems with this, which is why he\u2019s currently grinding his teeth to blunt nubs in exasperation because Wilson apparently missed the memo that this is <em>going to fucking work</em>. \u201cWilson, I swear to God\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too risky! It\u2019ll never work, Gavin, not in a million years! We should just bust \u2018em straight up, soon as they walk in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta back Wilson up on this one, man,\u201d Andy, the traitor, says. \u201cI mean, I know he\u2019s like a state-of the-art android and all, but\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gavin interrupts, incredulous and staring between the two <em>jackasses</em> like they\u2019ve just grown a third, stupider head between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, have <em>you</em> been workin\u2019 with him for three months? Been in the field with him, had a perfect closed-case record?\u201d He grants them the most pointed look he can muster, and feels a shitty surge of self-satisfaction when no one answers him. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOfficer Wilson, Officer Brown,\u201d R.K interjects calmly, but Gavin can tell he\u2019s losing his patience as well. \u201cKnow that I\u2019m <em>squeezing</em> every ounce of respect I have for Detective Reed completely dry when I say it-\u201d and he effortlessly dodges the kick that Gavin aims for his shin, \u201c-but there is a high probability that his plan will succeed. It may be rash and ill-thought-out, but I believe that guile over force is necessary. Undercover is our best option if we wish to see evidence of a Red Ice trade with our own eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Gavin purposely ignores his partner\u2019s\u00a0<em>rash</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>ill-thought-out</em>\u00a0remarks. He\u2019s sure the prick meant <em>wise</em> and <em>sensible</em> or something, and his internal processor or whatever just got mixed up. Obviously what happened. \u201cMe and R can handle this. We can pass for buyers no problem, and you and Andy can keep a look out while we play it cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, man\u2026\u201d Wilson begins, looking R.K up and down, and Gavin somehow feels his tolerance wear even thinner. Soon it\u2019ll be non-existent, and then there\u2019ll be trouble. \u201cHas he ever even been undercover before? I mean, you need some sort of experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K laces his hands behind his back, projecting that tolerance that Gavin no longer has. \u201cI assure you both, this is as good a plan as we\u2019ll be able to execute within the limited timeframe we have. Detective Reed knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he adds, giving Gavin a nod, \u201cand I was built for such tasks as negotiation. I was not programmed to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, <em>Wilson</em>,\u201d Gavin says pointedly, \u201cstop your bitching, and Andy sort out your fuckin\u2019 hair. And what kind of pervert wears a check shirt to a club, man, what the fuck is wrong with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not wanting to risk waiting around to give them any more time to argue, Gavin turns and heads for the doorway leading to the main area of the AXIS lounge. R.K follows him closely. <em>Don\u2019t stare, don\u2019t stare, don\u2019t fucking stare</em>. Gavin\u2019s been fucking battling the impulse to stare at him like a total creep for the whole evening.</p>\n<p>He knows what the problem is: he\u2019s never seen the android out of that dumb turtleneck before, and now he thinks it was for a good reason. R\u2019s throat\u2019s on show, as pale and flawless as the rest of him, and Gavin can\u2019t for the life of him stop glancing at it. Or at the rest of him, fuck it. Why deny it to himself, he fucking knows he\u2019s doing it. The android\u2019s dressed mostly in black; boots, tight jeans that make his legs look like they go on for goddamn <em>miles</em>. Only the shirt\u2019s white, and it hugs every perfect fucking curve of his shoulders and arms.</p>\n<p>Gavin hadn\u2019t even thought R.K <em>owned</em> other clothes, but here they were.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s disconcerting, too, to see R without his LED. When Wilson had asked Gavin to join the bust, he\u2019d warned he wasn\u2019t going anywhere without R. Wilson, being the cautious fuckstick that he is, argued that the android would give them away. Then R.K had picked up the nearest pair of scissors and jimmied the LED loose from the crest of his brow.\u00a0<em>Lead the way, Detective</em>, he\u2019d said, and Gavin had smirked at Wilson\u2019s expression for the entire drive downtown.</p>\n<p>Still, Gavin isn\u2019t sure he likes it. R.K\u2019s <em>always</em> hard to read, but at least with the LED there he'd had some indication of basic emotions. Blue: he was good. Yellow: processing, confused, all that jazz, nothing really to worry about. Red: definitely bad. It had always been as simple as that. But with it gone, there\u2019s no foundation to draw from.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for four men,\u201d R.K says, voice low as they make their way down the corridor, Wilson and Brown trailing behind. \u201cHenrik Brandt, the head of the operation. Mid-fifties, grey hair and green eyes. His right-hand man, name unknown, though he should be recognisable from a cobra tattoo on the left side of his neck. And finally, Brandt\u2019s bodyguards. Karl and Eriksen Lund. Early thirties, blonde hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you tellin\u2019 me this, dipshit,\u201d Gavin gripes as they reach the doors to the lounge. \u201cI read the case file, you know I know who we\u2019re lookin\u2019 for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt never hurts to be prepared,\u201d R.K retorts, infuriatingly level-headed at his side. \u201cAnd you humans do have an incredibly short attention-span. I thought it best to ensure you were as informed as possible.\u201d Before Gavin can argue, R.K takes the handle and opens the door, gesturing for him to go first. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right, after me.\u201d Gavin tries, he really fucking does, <em>not</em> to focus on how well R\u2019s shirt fits him as he brushes past the android. He fails, like an absolute trooper.</p>\n<p>The low, pulsing bass of the music hits him the second he steps through. It\u2019s dimly lit; lighting is tinged purple, matching the cushions on the bar stools and reflecting in the glass of the drinks and tables. The place is crowded considering it\u2019s still early; people dressed to impress in glitter and tight-fitting dresses, or in suits and shirts and polished shoes. Gavin realises he hasn\u2019t made as much of an effort as he\u2019d thought he had, though he definitely doesn\u2019t stick out enough to attract any sideways glances.</p>\n<p>R, though, blends in about as well as a wolf blends in with some sheep.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s probably taller than anybody here; looming and poised and plain\u00a0<em>sinful</em>\u00a0in that shirt. Gavin\u2019s staring again. You know, like an asshole. And he\u2019s fallen behind; R.K\u2019s heading straight to the bar in an attempt to seem like an ordinary patron.\u00a0<em>Don\u2019t attract attention</em>, Gavin reminds himself. <em>Get your shit together, c\u2019mon.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cLeft of the bar, over by the mirror,\u201d he waylays to Wilson and Andy. \u201cThat should give you a decent scope of the room. Stay there, watch our backs. Signal us if you see anythin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>They nod their assent and pair off, heading to the booth whilst Gavin joins R.K at the bar. There\u2019s a drink waiting for him. An old fashioned? He frowns as R.K finishes talking to the bartender, some a skinny girl \u2013 Gavin assumes they\u2019re a girl, at least, but he could be wrong \u2013 with shocking white hair and tattoos trailing along their arms. They retreat to the far end of the bar, and R.K shoots a smile down at Gavin. <em>Keep it together, Reed.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFor you,\u201d the android clarifies, sliding the drink closer with two, long fingers. \u201cWe should, in your own words, act natural. And I doubt one drink will hurt. Your alcohol tolerance is high enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin would ask how the fuck R.K knows his alcohol tolerance, but he\u2019s certain he\u2019ll get some convoluted answer that he won\u2019t understand or care about. \u201cHow\u2019d you know what I\u2019d order?\u201d he asks instead, genuinely curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d R.K answers. \u201cThe ingredients reminded me of you, however.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin grins, taking a sip. \u201cWhat, neat and classic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBitter and occasionally difficult to swallow,\u201d R corrects, unamused. \u201cThough I suppose your interest in Tarantino movies does make you something of a classic, if that\u2019s how you\u2019d prefer to see yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Gavin smirks, nudging R with his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re such a fuckin\u2019 prick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPot, meet kettle.\u201d R.K peers around the lounge, and Gavin can\u2019t stop himself just\u2026\u00a0<em>taking him in</em>\u00a0while he does. The fucking mood lighting and shit isn\u2019t helping, either. It makes R\u2019s eyes look darker, makes his cheekbones stand out more and catches on the sharp edge of his jaw in a way that\u2019s making Gavin\u2019s legs lose feeling. Fuck. \u201cNo sign on our suspects, as of yet. White told me that Brendt is typically here before nine PM.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bartender,\u201d R.K says, nodding towards the white-haired girl and or guy and or neither. Gavin still can\u2019t fucking tell. \u201cIt never hurts to find out someone\u2019s name, I\u2019ve found. Especially since I rather appreciate having my own now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin wishes to hell, heaven and earth that R would stop smiling at him like that. But he can\u2019t fucking win, \u2018cause on the other hand he sees it so rarely he feels like he should savour it to the full while he can.</p>\n<p>He takes a sip \u2013 ok, gulp, sue him \u2013 of the old fashioned, letting the bitterness seep into his tongue and silently ordering himself for the hundrenth time to pack up all his shit and <em>keep it</em> the fuck <em>together</em>. They\u2019re on a job; ogling his partner should be the last thing on his iota. It doesn\u2019t help that his partner\u2019s six-foot-whatever of sex on legs; with that fucking mouth and that dumb tuft of hair that\u2019s always hanging over his forehead like Clark fucking Kent.</p>\n<p>When he tears his eyes away, Gavin has sense enough to glance at the entrance, and that\u2019s when their suspects walk in. \u201cR.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The group are greeted by one of the waitresses, and led to a large booth in a nice, shady corner of the establishment.</p>\n<p>Gavin makes sure Wilson and Andy have seen them too, and have a good view of their suspects\u2019 table. He can\u2019t signal them to call back-up or a squad car yet, not without physical evidence of a Red Ice deal, and the only shifty thing the men have done so far is enter the place and <em>look</em> like bad guys.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s our cobra tattoo,\u201d Gavin remarks, sighting the dark pattern snaking its way up the side of the tallest man\u2019s neck. \u201cLooks like these are our guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suggest we wait before approaching them. If we seem too eager, it may arouse their suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give it ten minutes or somethin\u2019. Give \u2018em chance to settle in, have a few drinks before they\u2019re spendin\u2019 the rest of their lives getting ass-fucked in downtown\u2019s prison showers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCharming image.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin takes another sip of his old fashioned, before he frowns down at the half empty glass. \u201cFeels weird drinkin\u2019 alone. Shit, is this how Anderson feels? It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and then the glass is plucked from under his nose, and R\u2019s bringing it to his lips, taking a generous taste.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, hey,\u201d Gavin warns, too late as R.K lowers the cocktail and hands it back to him. \u201cYou can actually drink that, right? It\u2019s not gonna mess up your components or whatever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAndroids are fitted with an internal modulator. It detoxifies and defuses any harmful liquids,\u201d R assures him. \u201cI cannot become intoxicated, but I can drink in moderate amounts. It\u2019s probably not a good idea to overindulge the habit, but I doubt one drink will majorly affect my systems.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin considers the information. Then, cautiously, slides the old fashioned back in R.K\u2019s direction. \u201cCyberLife thought of everythin\u2019, huh. Is there anything that\u00a0<em>would</em>\u00a0make you drunk?\u201d he asks, as an afterthought. Drunk R.K might just be the most hilarious notion on the planet. \u201cSomethin\u2019 that, I dunno, could get through your system enough to make you feel it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d R answers, studying the cocktail. \u201cSince alcohol is technically considered <em>dangerous</em>, I have fail-proof defences to combat its effects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Gavin scoffs, \u201csucks to be you. Bein\u2019 drunk ain\u2019t so bad most of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine I\u2019d prefer to keep a clear head anyway, whether I had the option or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPractical,\u201d R.K amends, but he looks amused. \u201cHowever, I do not mind indulging a little. If you\u2019d rather not drink alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Gavin doesn\u2019t know why the thought happens or where the ever-merciful <em>fuck</em> it comes from, but in that second he imagines kissing him. Sudden, and hard, and <em>deep</em>. He wants to taste the whiskey on R\u2019s lips, wants to curl his fingers through that fucking hair and see how real it feels against his palms. Fuck. Fuck, fuck,\u00a0<em>fuck</em>. This isn\u2019t fucking happening. Gavin\u2019s always fallen too hard, too fast, and it\u2019s never worked out because he either always fucks it up, or he always falls for the wrong kind of guy who ends up fucking him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cEriksen\u2019s moving.\u201d R.K\u2019s voice snaps him back to reality, and Gavin forces himself not to whip around and expose their cover. \u201cHe\u2019s coming to the bar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within ten minutes, Gavin and R.K are sitting opposite Henrik Brandt in the dealer\u2019s booth. Watching R.K work was, as much as it pains Gavin a little to admit as much, a fucking masterpiece. Actually, for once, no. Gavin\u2019s not too proud to admit it. For all the android\u2019s emotional constipation, the second he\u2019d engaged Eriksen Lund at the bar, R had become a totally different person. Open, charming, although the confidence and the composure stayed. Gavin doubted that was ever going to go anywhere.</p>\n<p>It had never been clearer that the RK-series specialised in negotiation. The android had gained Eriksen\u2019s trust in seconds, and they had been invited over to Brandt\u2019s table to hash out a deal.</p>\n<p>Gavin had made a signal to Wilson and Andy on the way over, warning them to discreetly call for back-up. He was certain these were their men, and certain they\u2019d have evidence of Red Ice <em>tonight</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going well, and they have the suspects\u2019 trust. All until the subject of money comes up, and suddenly cobra tattoo is scowling at them from his seat beside Brandt on the other side of the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re arguing with us,\u201d R.K muses. \u201cOur price is perfectly reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy stuff is pure, yeah?\u201d Brandt sneers, eyes narrowed at the android as though he\u2019d just insulted his mother or something. \u201cPure and off the fuckin\u2019 market. And you have the fuckin\u2019 nerve to haggle with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what I hear, your stuff ain\u2019t any more special than all the other shit in circulation,\u201d Gavin says, picking up on R\u2019s play. If they question that quality of the Red Ice, Brandt might be coerced into physically bringing out the drugs for them to sample. They\u2019d have their evidence, clear as day. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re asking for way too much. You\u2019re overpriced, and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>fuck</em> did you just say to me?\u201d Brandt spits out, hand squeezing around his whisky hard enough to make cracks appear in the glass tumbler. Gavin isn\u2019t intimidated. He\u2019s been dealing with fuckheads like Brandt for far too long to be scared by this shit anymore. \u201cYou little fuck\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat my partner said, Mr. Brandt,\u201d R.K cuts across, lacing those hands together atop the table; all agile fingers and pale skin and\u2013 and fucking\u00a0<em>shit</em>, Gavin needs to <em>stop</em>, \u201cis that you\u2019re overpriced. I would have assumed after all your self-confessed years of experience at the top of the drugs trade, you would be more skilled at negotiations,\u201d he adds, extremely shittily, because Gavin knows that the gorgeous idiot can\u2019t help himself when he\u2019s on a roll. \u201cHowever, it seems I was mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brandt gapes. Karl and Eriksen gape. They look like a trio of puffer fishes. But cobra tattoo snaps out of his shock first. He hasn\u2019t spoken yet, but he\u2019s the biggest, the tallest of the four dealers, even towering over R.K from where he sits opposite.</p>\n<p>The man practically <em>growls</em>, glaring across at R with what Gavin presumes is supposed to be a threatening expression. \u201cI beg your fuckin\u2019 pardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K just crosses one leg over the other. Amused and unafraid and\u00a0<em>beautiful</em>, and he levels Cobra Tattoo with that cold, fictitious smile that doesn\u2019t quite meet his eyes. \u201cThen beg.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s fairly certain he\u2019s never had a hard-on in the middle of a drug\u2019s deal before. But he was about to fucking get one, so he\u2019s almost thankful that shit hits the fan when and where it does.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust couldn\u2019t keep your smart fuckin\u2019 mouth shut, could you,\u201d he says bitterly, knuckles split, cheek bruised, and wrist aching when he brings a cigarette to his lips. He doesn\u2019t smoke often, but he fucking needs one after this bullshit evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did arrest the suspects,\u201d R.K points out, sat neatly beside him outside the AXIS lounge. Or as neat as he can be, considering he\u2019s covered in small, dispersed splatterings of his own thirium. It\u2019s dark now, and there are officers and the red-blue flashes of squad cars and police tape cordoning off the area behind them as Brandt and his men are escorted away. \u201cWhich, I\u2019ll remind you, is what Officer Wilson and Officer Brown were aiming for when they invited us along. So. Mission accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we got \u2018em arrested for pulling their fuckin\u2019 guns on us. What we were\u00a0<em>aiming</em>\u00a0to do,\u201d Gavin reminds him, though he knows the asshole doesn\u2019t <em>need</em> reminding, \u201cwas bust them for dealing. Not for a fuckin\u2019 shootout.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere will undoubtedly be evidence of Red Ice on them,\u201d R.K points out, maddeningly calm at his side. Their shoulders are pressed together. \u201cAnd now that they\u2019ve been arrested, we won\u2019t need a warrant to search them or their residences. So, I\u2019ll say again\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, mission accomplished.\u201d Gavin shoves R.K\u2019s arm with his own, and takes another, long drag of his cigarette. \u201cWhoop-de-fuckin\u2019-do. You\u2019re such an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have joined the FBI,\u201d R.K sighs, but there\u2019s a smile in his voice.</p>\n<p>Gavin snorts. \u201cLike anyone else\u2019d be able to put up with your shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a delight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 maniac and you know it.\u201d Gavin takes a final drag, watches the smoke swirl leisurely against the dark skyline. \u201cY\u2019know, I thought the whole point of you was to work all the kinks outta Connor. Improve him? Not make him fuckin\u2019 worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K hums, thoughtful, before giving a slight shrug that jostles Gavin\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that someone may have, to borrow a phrase from you, fucked up somewhere. Though with CyberLife under new management now, I suppose we\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin chuckles, flicks his cigarette to the floor and gets to his feet. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he says, stretching out his spine and wincing when he hears about four different things pop. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the station. Get this fuckin\u2019 paperwork over with. You\u2019re doin\u2019 it, by the way,\u201d he adds as they walk side by side to one of the squad cars. \u201cAll this,\u201d he emphasises, gesturing around them, \u201cwas your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought the definition of partnership was\u00a0<em>working together</em>,\u201d the android says dryly. \u201cThis is as much your fault as mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow d\u2019you figure that, shitbird? I ain\u2019t the one they pulled their guns on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u00a0<em>are</em> the one who called Mr. Brandt a raging cunt. I\u2019d assumed that\u2019s why he fired in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin huffs. Totally not true. Well. Kind of not. He <em>did </em>call him a raging cunt. \u201cFine. You do over <em>half</em>\u00a0the paperwork, and if Fowler starts giving me shit, you\u2019re taking the blame.\u201d</p>\n<p>R.K shakes his head, smiling, \u201cAs you say, Detective,\u201d and something in Gavin\u2019s stomach starts\u00a0simmering, hot and cruel and agonising,\u00a0when the backs of their hands brush. He wishes he was brave enough to just thread their fucking fingers together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been like this, relentless and teasing and incredible, for two months now. Two fucking months. And as they slide into the back of the squad car, and R\u2019s knee bumps against his own, Gavin firmly decides that he really needs to sit down and decide what he\u2019s going to do about it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s July, Friday evening, and on Broadway St, Detroit, in apartment eight on the thirteenth floor, Gavin\u2019s about to pull his gun on his cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMia, I swear to fuckin\u2019 God\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Too late. He presses his eyes closed as the sound of shattering crockery fills his kitchen. A groan claws its way out of his throat, and he glares at the furry fuckstick perched on the counter; all innocent blue eyes and cute dark smudges around her nose, but Gavin knows goddamn better.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the third cup this week, you little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mia doesn\u2019t look at him. She licks her paw instead, and rubs it behind her ear to let him know that she, quite frankly, doesn\u2019t give a fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better behave yourself if this thing happens. Else I\u2019m makin\u2019 you into a rug.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cat\u2019s ear twitches, not exactly in reassurance. But Gavin doesn\u2019t have the patience to fully explain everything to her.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few days since their last job. A few days of him going over and over how this situation might play out; the pros, the cons, the fallout if something goes wrong, how much longer he can actually take any of this and bear <em>not</em> doing something about it. He\u2019s got his phone in hand, and he\u2019s leaning against the far counter between the stove and all the drawers, and it\u2019s at this point Gavin realises he\u2019s quite literally backed into a corner. <em>How fucking poetic.</em></p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath. Brings up his contacts.</p>\n<p>Overthinks. Hesitates.</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>He texts Chen instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>-----------------------------\u00a0\u00a0</em>Friday 24<sup>th</sup>\u00a0July, 2039 (PM)<em>\u00a0 -----------------------------</em></p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(19:33)</em><br>don\u2019t say a word.

He paces instead, gearing himself up, considering how the fuck to start, what to say. Eventually, he comes to a standstill back in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>He bites out Chen\u2019s advice to himself, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fuckin\u2019 pussy, Reed,\u201d and at long last types out a message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>-----------------------------\u00a0\u00a0</em>Friday 24<sup>th</sup>\u00a0July, 2039 (PM)<em>\u00a0 -----------------------------</em></p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(19:48)</em><br>hey you busy</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would be a fucking grown up and call, but he knows he\u2019d lose his nerve.

Screw CyberLife. It\u2019s like they\u2019d probed into every little thought Gavin had ever had about a man and used them to put R.K together, piece by fucking piece; the dark hair and those eyes and the\u00a0<em>legs</em>\u00a0and that\u00a0conceited, shitty note that\u2019s always in his voice and that\u00a0<em>fucking mouth</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mrrrow.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to get my shit together, Mia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><u>Gavin</u></strong><br><em>(19:51)</em><br>come over here and watch it then</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sends the message before he can second guess himself, and tries to ignore the cruel upsurge of anxiety in his gut.

Mia, of course, doesn\u2019t lift a paw to help. \u201cBitch,\u201d Gavin reminds her, when she finds a stray pair of socks on the coffee table and lies over them.</p>\n<p>He loves his apartment. It\u2019s studio, spacious; living-room, dining-room, kitchen area all open and connected to each other, big windows in the bedroom that give him a decent view of the city, floorboards that don\u2019t creak too loudly if you can learn to ignore them. But Gavin\u2019s suddenly, irrationally very\u00a0<em>conscious</em>\u00a0of it. And especially of the one wall with no plaster or wallpaper; just open bricks that he\u2019s always thought gave the place a retro-like feel to it, but now he wonders whether he should\u2019ve gotten it covered up. Not like he has the time or the equipment to do it\u00a0<em>now</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mrrrrrrrow</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin has to agree with her. \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s stupid, Miss Obvious. I\u2019m freakin\u2019 out, okay, let me get it outta my fuckin\u2019 system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mia blinks once, lazily, and watches Gavin pace about, correcting things here and there; the tension and nerves steadily building and building and building until there\u2019s a curt knock at the door. <em>Precisely\u00a0</em>twenty minutes after R\u2019s last text.</p>\n<p>Gavin unlatches the bolt, and doesn\u2019t have a fucking clue why he expected the android to be in his usual, regulation getup. But he kind of wishes he was. The black shirt is, as though to cause Gavin physical pain, a perfect fit. And the trousers look fucking tailored to his legs. It\u2019s infuriatingly sophisticated, adding to that one theory he\u2019s always had that androids are inbuilt with a fancy sense of fashion, for some reason or other.</p>\n<p>Gavin remembers that he\u2019s wearing his dad\u2019s old and faded Nirvana t-shirt, and he inwardly grimaces. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening. The woman downstairs knew who I was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin frowns, suddenly wary as all hell. \u201cWhat, Lucille?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I took the elevator,\u201d R explains, still standing outside the threshold of the apartment. Gavin\u2019s apparently too dumbstruck by how\u00a0<em>fucking good</em> he looks to be able to invite him in. The LED\u2019s back at the side of his brow, at least; circling in a calm, reassuring blue. \u201cShe said, \u2018you must be the young man Detective Reed has been telling me about\u2019. She was pleasant. A neighbour, I assume?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin grimaces, for real this time. \u201cYeah, I uh\u2026 might\u2019ve mentioned you once or twice. Gotta tell someone about how much you piss me off, otherwise bottling it up would drive me nuts,\u201d he lies through his teeth.</p>\n<p>Lucille was one of the only other occupants in the building Gavin could stand to talk to. So, naturally, the first time she\u2019d seen him storm in from work, muttering to himself about\u00a0<em>stupid eyes</em>\u00a0<em>and hair and long legs</em>, she\u2019d lent a willing ear. Gavin had ended up spewing all the sap and confusion he\u2019d been holding back for weeks, and now he hoped to <em>God</em> that the older woman hadn\u2019t blown this for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here I\u2019d always pictured you ranting to your cat,\u201d R.K muses, and Gavin feels his apprehension ease a little. \u201cI hear pets are good listeners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever been around a cat, have you. They\u2019re assholes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide that for myself,\u201d R smiles, before tilting his head in the direction of the door. \u201cAm I still invited, or would you prefer I stand here for the evening? I don\u2019t get tired idling around, but I imagine that humans do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin curses himself for blocking the entryway like an actual dumb fuck. He steps aside. \u201cSure. Come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Soon he has to laugh at himself for panicking at all.</p>\n<p>The moment R\u2019s in his apartment, it\u2019s basically like they\u2019re at work, or at a crime scene, or out somewhere on a break. It\u2019s\u00a0<em>easy</em>. It\u2019s\u00a0<em>familiar</em>. And Mia sees fit to dig a claw into the back of Gavin\u2019s hand as he passes her by, as if she\u2019d known the entire time that there\u2019d been no reason to overreact.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know jackshit, cat, leave me alone,\u201d he mutters, as the android roams around the living room, perfectly at ease within the new space. \u201cYou, behave,\u201d Gavin adds to the cat, louder, seeing the tip of Mia\u2019s tail start to twitch as R.K comes closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Mia.\u201d R holds out his hand in greeting and lets the cat sniff at his fingers cautiously. Then she rubs her head against his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mrrrrow</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin snorts. \u201cWanna know what she did when I first met her? She clawed half my fuckin\u2019 hand off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve clearly taught her some manners since then. How surprising.\u201d R\u2019s head is cocked as he watches Mia curve her whole body up beneath his palm, purring. \u201cI take it this is a good sign?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she\u2019s not got anythin\u2019 sharp in you, it\u2019s a good sign.\u201d Gavin smiles though, kind of proud. It\u2019d probably sound stupid as hell trying to explain it to anyone without a pet, but introducing them to someone, and them actually\u00a0<em>liking</em>\u00a0the person, was a pretty big fucking deal. \u201cShe likes you. Don\u2019t know why,\u201d he adds, because he can, and because he knows it will make R smile too. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure out what an asshole you are soon enough. Cats are good like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, she already lives with an asshole,\u201d the android points out, as Mia rolls onto her back atop the counter to reveal her belly, the little fucking show off. \u201cShe must be well adapted to them by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin gives him the finger, and leaves R to get the movie ready while he fixes himself a drink. He\u2019s going to need it if he\u2019s surviving the next three hours sat with the android; in that fitted shirt and with Mia following him around and purring like R.K\u2019s God\u2019s gift to cat-kind. Or maybe she just thinks he looks like a large, portable climbing post. He does, to be fair.</p>\n<p>As an afterthought, he fixes a drink for the android too, remembering that he said he\u00a0<em>can</em>\u00a0drink in small quantities. Gavin\u2019s always hated drinking alone, after all, though he pours a considerably smaller amount than he\u2019s given himself, just in case scotch whisky isn\u2019t as safe as the AXIS lounge\u2019s bourbon.</p>\n<p>He hands over the glass. \u201cI know you can\u2019t really drink, but\u2026 well,\u201d he says, <em>oh-so</em> articulately. \u201cWhy not, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>R, perched on the edge of the couch, accepts it. \u201cThank you. You know this won\u2019t affect me in any way, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll kid me into thinkin\u2019 I\u2019m not sad enough to be drinking by myself on a Friday night.\u201d Gavin throws himself down on the opposite end of the couch, because he\u2019s a coward. \u201cMia\u2019s a terrible drinking buddy, anyway. Can\u2019t hold her milk.\u201d</p>\n<p>The android chuckles, and Gavin takes a long, healthy sip of his drink to try and quash the churning blend of nausea and exhilaration in his stomach. He relaxes slightly as the familiar opening scene begins to fade into focus on the TV.</p>\n<p>As Yolanda and Pumpkin start their robbery, and the opening credits begin to roll, Gavin chances a glimpse at the other end of the couch. R\u2019s sitting straight, as always, head angled with interest as he regards the screen. One of his hands is idly scratching behind Mia\u2019s ear where the cat\u2019s come to curl up on his thigh.</p>\n<p>Gavin tries to focus on the TV. He really does. Where Jules and Vincent start to talk about movie theatres in Amsterdam and foot rubs and Royales with Cheese. Though at some point, R leans back against the cushions and Mia stretches out across his legs, and <em>that</em>, of all the fucking moments in time, is when Gavin recognises how fucked he might actually be. When he realises that this is a scene he might very happily like to see for the rest of his life; R, gorgeous and poised on his couch, with Gavin\u2019s bitch of a cat sprawled out over his lap, watching an old movie with a glass of whisky the android probably can\u2019t even taste.</p>\n<p>R makes it an admirable thirty minutes before he finds his first inaccuracy with the movie. And Gavin absolutely doesn\u2019t acknowledge that he\u2019s in love.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would this Marcellus Wallace trust another man with his wife after past events?\u201d The android\u2019s frowning. Not in distaste, just in curiosity. \u201cIf he\u2019d readily throw a man from a balcony for giving Mia a foot rub, it stands to reason that he\u2019s overly possessive. And therefore it makes no sense for him to ask Vincent to keep Mia company, particularly considering her behaviour the last time he was out of town.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWallace likes to test people. See what happens, make a show of it. Think he enjoys it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn odd hobby. Risking his wife\u2019s fidelity for his own amusement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gavin agrees, giving Mia a scratch of his own when the cat rubs her head over his knee. Half his drink\u2019s gone, and the alcohol\u2019s blessedly starting to work; he feels a lot of the strain in his body start to ease. But his head\u2019s still clear. \u201cAnd I mean, it\u2019s important to the plot, too. A lot of directors trade in accuracy for the sake of dramatic tension when it comes to a good story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to know rather a lot about movies,\u201d the android remarks, and Gavin abruptly realizes that they\u2019re closer. R\u2019s no longer leaning against the far arm of the couch, and Gavin\u2019s no longer pressing himself into his own corner. One of them must have moved. He\u2019s not sure who. \u201cAnother influence of your father\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin nods, as Vincent and Mia arrive at Jack Rabbit Slim\u2019s and are greeted by Buddy Holly at their table. \u201cHe was really into shit like this. Old movies, camera work, directing, all that stuff. Think he wanted me to get into it. Y\u2019know, professionally,\u201d he adds, reaching over to pluck R\u2019s whiskey from the coffee table and take a sip. \u201cHe was never disappointed I went to the DPD, but I know it wasn\u2019t what he wanted for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he supported your decision?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s proud and all that,\u201d Gavin answers. \u201cThink it\u2019s a dad thing, though. He never followed his dream of getting into film or anythin\u2019, so he figured he\u2019d try and get me to go for it. I doubt things ever usually work out like that for anyone, but I dunno,\u201d he says, attention back on the screen as Vincent takes a sip of Mia\u2019s $5 milkshake. \u201cMaybe it was selfish, but police work just felt like the right choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>R hums in reply, and he leans across to retrieve his glass and take a thoughtful sip. \u201cI think it was. You\u2019re an outstanding detective.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin can barely hear the voices on the TV after that. But he\u2019s watched this movie so many times he knows it by heart, as Mia and Vincent stare across at one another in their booth.<br><br></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Don\u2019t you hate that?\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Hate what?\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Uncomfortable silences.\u2019<br><br></em>\n</p>\n<p>Gavin forces himself to scoff at the android\u2019s compliment, though he can feel a hot and thrilled flush spreading up the back of his neck. \u201cOutstanding. Sure, if you say so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do say so.\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u2018Why do we feel it\u2019s necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a good question.\u2019<br><br></em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m exceedingly thankful you joined the DPD,\u201d R continues, voice sincere and expression open and Mia\u2019s fallen asleep in the crook of his arm, and Gavin is so desperately, so absurdly in love with him. \u201cI doubt I\u2019d have met you if you hadn\u2019t. And despite first impressions, I\u2019ve rather enjoyed meeting you.\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018That\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve found somebody really special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet. But don\u2019t feel bad, we just met each other.\u2019</em>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>By the time Vincent and Mia are dancing on the stage, moving their feet to the music to win that trophy, Gavin\u2019s thighs are on either side of R\u2019s hips, and R\u2019s licking into his mouth, and Gavin\u2019s hands are finally buried in that fucking hair.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know which one of them moved this time, either. But he knows that R\u2019s lips taste like whiskey, and his hands are\u00a0<em>everywhere</em>; taking Gavin\u2019s jaw, sliding down his neck, his shoulders, snaking under the back of his shirt and pressing against bare skin, and Gavin makes a noise that he\u2019s\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0proud of, but he can hardly find thought to care. R swallows the sound anyway, tongue pressing into him, warm and wet and\u00a0<em>fuck</em>\u00a0Gavin has <em>not</em> drank nearly enough to have been prepared for this, for how fucking\u00a0<em>right</em>\u00a0it feels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew I was right,\u201d R says, as he nudges his nose against Gavin\u2019s jaw and presses a kiss beneath it; open-mouthed and with his canines sinking a small ways into Gavin\u2019s skin. \u201cWhen I said humans like to make things harder for themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin can only make a noise in question, dragging his fingers through R\u2019s hair and tipping his head back to give the android\u2019s mouth more room. \u201cHuh..?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d just told me you wanted this, instead of fumbling over it like a child in the AXIS lounge and assuming I didn\u2019t notice, we could have been here a good few days ago. Weeks, perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck\u2013\u201d R bites down properly this time, teeth sharp and hands sliding under Gavin\u2019s t-shirt, against the skin of his lower back, and Gavin nuzzles closer. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>R\u2019s fingers thread through Gavin\u2019s belt loops to tug him further on top of him. \u201cEloquent as ever,\u201d he mumbles against him, lips exploring the stubble along Gavin\u2019s jaw and down his neck, and the fingertips of one hand find their way beneath the hem of Gavin\u2019s jeans.</p>\n<p>Gavin hands are kneading into R\u2019s hair, pulling, grasping, and every little tug rewards him with another of those open-mouthed kisses to his skin, and these gorgeous, stuttered breaths that the android doesn\u2019t even need to take.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u00a0<em>shit</em>,\u201d Gavin chokes out, when R\u2019s fingers rake their way down his spine; moving beneath his shirt, making him arch into the touch and grind down against R\u2019s deliciously solid weight. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re\u2026 have you done this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>The android sucks a bruise into Gavin\u2019s neck, teeth only bearing down harder when Gavin moans and tightens his grip in R\u2019s hair. \u201cI have.\u201d R laves his tongue over the aching mark afterwards, as an almost-apology, though the pressure is hard and the sting of it goes straight to Gavin\u2019s cock, and he can feel R\u2019s smile pressed against him. \u201cAs a matter of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a moment for the information to catch up with him; R\u2019s hands have roamed around to the front of his shirt, running through the rough hair trailing up his navel, and then sliding over his ribs, and Gavin\u2019s own hands slip beneath the neckline of the android\u2019s shirt to curve over his shoulders. But, once it does, it\u2019s enough to tune Gavin out of his lust-driven haze for a blip, and he peers down, which is a huge mistake. R\u2019s hair is a glorious wreck, and his lips are wet and smirking, and his eyes are so dark and so warm that Gavin just stares.</p>\n<p>The android mistakes whatever he sees on Gavin\u2019s face for confusion. \u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t surprise you,\u201d R says, amused, taking one of Gavin\u2019s hands away from his shoulders and pressing two fingertips to his mouth while he speaks. \u201cI was activated six months before we met at the DPD. I had ample time to explore my deviancy before I accepted Connor\u2019s request to join the precinct.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin can feel himself frowning. He wonders who the fuck else had dared get to be in this position; to get to see R\u2019s pupils wide and his LED flashing like that, to have R\u2019s tongue and teeth running over their fingers, to have marks pressed into their neck. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who the fuck was he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>She</em>,\u201d R corrects. He looks fond, entertained by Gavin\u2019s petty questions. \u201cAnd it was only one night. I must confess, I was disinterested in repeating the experience, so I never did. But perhaps I had just chosen the wrong person.\u201d His smile turns painfully soft, and he pulls Gavin down with a hand fisted into his shirt, until their lips are barely touching. \u201cYou seem to have the capacity to capture my interest in every possible way, Detective.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Gavin knows that if he doesn\u2019t kiss him, touch him, do\u00a0<em>something,</em>\u00a0 he\u2019ll say something he\u2019ll regret. He\u2019ll move too fast, too soon, too hasty, and he\u2019ll fuck it up. And he really,\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0does not want to fuck this up. But it\u2019s hard to keep a leash on everything he wants to say, everything his stupid, needy, fucked-up heart wants this man to know, as R pulls him down further and kisses him, and kisses him, and\u00a0<em>kisses</em>\u00a0him, and Gavin has to do something; get out of this room, get R out of that fucking shirt, because he knows that if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll say it.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d He doesn\u2019t recognise his own voice; it way too rough, and the groan that slips from him when R\u2019s hands slide down over his ass is just fucking embarrassing. \u201cWe\u2019re not doin\u2019 this in front of my fucking cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not that Gavin knows where Mia\u2019s gone. Not that he could tear his eyes away from what\u2019s beneath him for a single fucking second, anyway.</p>\n<p>R has an eyebrow raised, but it\u2019s teasing, comforting. And with far more grace than Gavin\u2019s shuffling and almost tripping over the coffee table when he stands, R gets to his feet in one, fluid motion. As much as Gavin had enjoyed being in the man\u2019s lap, being above him and feeling those thighs beneath him and feeling the muscles of his shoulders against his palms, R towers over him now; crowding him, taking his hips in his grasp, and this close, Gavin has to let his head fall back to be able to look him in the eye, and he fucking adores it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where might we be going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin slides his hands up, around the edge of R\u2019s neck, thumbs grazing along the edge of that sharp,\u00a0<em>sharp</em>\u00a0jaw, and he draws him down for another kiss; slower, and heated, and Gavin\u2019s breathless and grinning when he finds the\u00a0sense to pull away. \u201cYou know damn well where we\u2019re goin\u2019, smartass.\u201d</p>\n<p>He backs up towards the bedroom, R\u2019s hand in his, those long fingers laced through\u00a0<em>his</em>, and those blue eyes are fixed on him. Gavin allows his nerves to spike only for a second, before he gives R\u2019s hand an impatient, resolute tug.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow shut the fuck up for once, tin can, and come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin couldn\u2019t fumble around for the light switch, or even remember where it is, if he wanted to, so the bedroom remains dark as they stumble inside.</p>\n<p>One of R\u2019s hands is in his hair, and the other\u2019s sliding the catch on his belt free, and Gavin\u2019s smiling and laughing against his mouth, and he feels like he\u2019s high. Beneath R\u2019s shirt, his fingers are taking their fill of taut skin and tensed muscles low along the android\u2019s stomach. There\u2019s enough light from the half-open drapes to be able to see; white and blue beams from cars and streetlamps cascade inside from the busy city, casting a vague outline of the bed and the furniture, and reflecting off the frames of old band and movie posters hung around the room.</p>\n<p>The back of Gavin\u2019s knees hit the mattress and he staggers backwards. He lands unceremoniously, catching himself on his elbows and sprawled on the bed with his legs dangling over the edge, but he can hardly care when R\u2019s smirking down at him like that; hair mussed and shirt ridden up, and Gavin wants to run his tongue over the sharp jut of his hipbones. \u201cGet the fuck down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>R, for once, does as he\u2019s told; kicking off his shoes as he crawls atop the sheets, and it\u2019s Gavin\u2019s good opinion that no\u00a0one, not even an android, should have any fucking right to move like <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>And, Gavin thinks to himself as he drags R down to take that smirking bottom lip between his teeth, he is thirty-six goddamn years old; <em>he</em> has no business being this fucking hard already. But then R\u2019s mouth is at his neck again, and he slides a long leg between Gavin\u2019s and <em>presses</em>, and Gavin could be seventeen or fucking sixty-five right now, and he\u2019d probably be just as hard.</p>\n<p>Groping to undo the buttons of R\u2019s shirt is the only thing keeping him level-headed. His fingers are trembling, and they catch on the fourth button down, and Gavin ends up unapologetically snapping the threads of the last few in his impatience.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis shirt,\u201d R mutters below his ear, voice pitched low, and Gavin shudders at the sound; feels a shiver spike across his spine, \u201cwas expensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin, because he\u2019s shitty, retorts, \u201cShould\u2019ve joined the FBI, then. Could\u2019ve got a pay rise.\u201d Though the fact that he gasps the words out, and his hands have slid around R\u2019s waist beneath the open shirt to palm across bare skin, lessens the derisive effect he was going for. Not that he can actually give a fuck, not in this position; with R mouthing at his neck, and his cock hard and aching in his jeans, and his hands practically clawing along the length of the android\u2019s shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>R only hums distractedly in answer anyway, drawing Gavin\u2019s shirt up and grazing his lips along his collarbone, peeking out from beneath Gavin\u2019s neckline. R\u2019s shoulders work to shrug off his own shirt completely and discard it to the floor, and Gavin realises, somewhere in the back of his hazy mind, that he\u2019s never seen the android so distracted before. He feels a hot pang of self-satisfaction at the fact that <em>he\u2019s</em> the one responsible for it.</p>\n<p>The mix of lights from the city outside spread across R\u2019s torso from the window, and he\u2019s <em>perfect</em>. And it\u2019s not just the very small, humble part of Gavin that thinks it; the android was literally designed to be perfect. He\u2019s visibly leaner than Gavin, and his muscles are lithe, built for speed, for agility, and without a fucking doubt, for driving Gavin mad these past two months. <em>Three</em>, if he\u2019s being honest with himself. From the fucking second Gavin had seen him, he\u2019d been irrevocably fucked, and he knows it now.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, yes\u2013\u201d R slips down further, an unyielding, solid weight above him, and he laves his tongue over a nipple, making Gavin\u2019s head fall back onto the sheets, eyes screwing shut and <em>groaning</em> open-mouthed at the ceiling. He feels R\u2019s hands at the waistband of his jeans while his mouth teases, curious and impatient, and the android\u2019s thumbs are digging into his hips, feeling Gavin writhe beneath his weight. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>, baby\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Moving lower, R hums again as he kisses a trail from Gavin\u2019s ribs to the small scar on his stomach. Tugging Gavin\u2019s jeans and boxers down to thigh level, the android glances up at him with a sly and greedy glint in his eyes. \u201cI would like,\u201d he says, pausing to take the head of Gavin\u2019s cock between his lips and <em>lick</em>, \u201cfor you to call me that often.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Gavin had manners, he\u2019d say a worded response was no longer within his capabilities. As it stands, he doesn\u2019t, and he doubts that he could even remember his own mother\u2019s name right now, let alone form a fucking coherent sound. All that leaves him is a desperate noise resembling something between a whine and a moan as R bears down on him; his lips closing around his cock<em>,</em> his tongue hot and wet and teasing, and his unrelenting hold on Gavin\u2019s hips prevents him from thrusting up into that cruel, gorgeous mouth beyond a few inches.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>R</em>\u2026\u201d Gavin whimpers his name, the single syllable breathless and strained as the android drags his tongue along the thick vein on the underside of his cock. <em>Fuck</em>, Gavin can\u2019t watch him do it; screws his eyes shut instead and grits his teeth as his stomach clenches with the heat of it. If he sees that fucking mouth on him, this will be over far too fucking quickly. \u201cR\u2026 R, baby\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>R listens to <em>that</em>, his gaze flickering up to Gavin\u2019s face as he lets his cock slide from his mouth. Fuck, the sight of it, all of it \u2013 R\u2019s untidy hair, his open, panting lips, and Gavin\u2019s dick leaking precome against his own stomach \u2013 is almost enough to finish him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d The android doesn\u2019t sound happy about being interrupted; his tone is clipped, dry, and Gavin has to chuckle. Though the laugh is far more choked, far rougher than he\u2019d like it to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby, you gotta slow down, seriously.\u201d Gavin threads his fingers through R\u2019s hair to soften the words, though, and the android leans into the touch the same way that Mia does when she\u2019s in a less bitchy mood than usual. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna fuckin\u2019 kill me. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He breaks off, and because Gavin panics \u2013 it\u2019s what he does every fucking time he might finally be happy, because he doesn\u2019t trust it for a second \u2013 a thought occurs to him as he takes R\u2019s appearance in; dishevelled and clearly irritated with Gavin\u2019s hesitation. Gavin knows that R claimed to have done this before, with some faceless, nameless woman who wasn\u2019t Gavin, and Gavin knows he doesn\u2019t have the right to be as pissed off about it as he is. But it suddenly hits him, with all the kindness of a freight train, that he knows nothing about androids and, well\u2026 <em>fucking</em>.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this even doing anythin\u2019 for you?\u201d Gavin feels ridiculous as he asks; pants around his thighs, cock still heavy and painfully hard against his stomach, shirt rumpled and only covering his shoulders. But he needs to ask, otherwise he has no idea what the fuck to do. He wants R to\u2026 well, he <em>wants</em> <em>R</em>. And the thought that Gavin doesn\u2019t know how to make the guy feel the same, doesn\u2019t know if he even <em>could</em> make him feel the same, cuts through the euphoria of the entire evening. \u201cI mean, are you even\u2026 y\u2019know, can you\u2026 I just\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>R gets sick of Gavin\u2019s ramblings before he even properly begins them. The android rolls his eyes, actually rolls his fucking eyes, and then Gavin sits up with a start, dread rising as R gets to his feet \u2013 <em>he\u2019s said something wrong, he\u2019s fucked it up, he should have just kept his fucking mouth shut, fuck, fuck, fuck</em> \u2013 and then R\u2019s kneeling on the bed, taking Gavin\u2019s wrist, his hand, his fingers, and guiding them, somehow gently and firmly at the same time, under the unzipped waistband of his jeans and\u2013 <em>oh fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cCyberLife was rather inclusive in our design,\u201d the android drawls, still clearly annoyed at the disruption. \u201cWe were built to integrate with humans, and thus we resemble humans in every way. I also have sensors which can be activated as and when I choose. They are activated currently. Now...\u201d And R hooks two of his fingers under Gavin\u2019s chin, tilts his head up to meet his eyes, and whatever it is that Gavin sees in them makes his cock throb and heat pound deep and low in his stomach. \u201cInstead of asking pointless questions, why don\u2019t you put that mouth to better use. And we\u2019ll see if that, as you put it, \u2018does anything for me\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesus. Fucking. Christ.</p>\n<p>R makes no other move beyond cocking his head, waiting, suddenly all patience again now that he has Gavin\u2019s full attention. Gavin\u2019s grateful for the short moment to allow his uncertainty, the anxiety, to scatter, and to feel need and relief rushing in eagerly to replace it. \u201cManiac.\u201d He intended to laugh, but all that leaves him is a shuddering breath as he rests his forehead against R\u2019s stomach, and he starts to press heated kisses down along the hard flesh and muscles of his pelvis.</p>\n<p>R lets him move as he will, but Gavin\u2019s very conscious of the fingers in his hair; they\u2019re not pushing, not even guiding, but they\u2019re just very, unignorably <em>there</em>. And they tighten when Gavin finally spreads his tongue over one of those hipbones, languidly running up the length of it as he frees R\u2019s cock from his jeans and starts stroking.</p>\n<p>He always knew Kamski was a fucking pervert, and Gavin doesn\u2019t know whether to be impressed or weirded out by the fact that someone at CyberLife had to sit down and consider what sort of cock to give an android. In the end, Gavin decides that the poor son of a bitch earned his pay check; R\u2019s above average, because of course he fucking is, and he\u2019s hard and perfect as the fucking rest of him, and the weight of him in Gavin\u2019s palm makes his own cock strain in neglect.</p>\n<p>Still, Gavin teases, keeping his hand around R\u2019s length and only mouthing at the skin around; his thighs, the supple lines of his abdomen. Until R\u2019s grip tightens into something approaching painful, and he tugs Gavin\u2019s head backwards to meet his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said,\u201d and there\u2019s a slight tension to the android\u2019s ever-calm tone, \u201cput that mouth to <em>better</em> use. As a detective, you can surely figure that out\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin relishes in the sound of R cutting off into a low, unintentional groan, the grasp on his hair faltering when Gavin pushes forward and takes him almost to the back of his throat. The intrusion is sudden \u2013 his own fault \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it to feel those fingers gripping his hair as he moves. Where R\u2019s kneeling in front of him on the mattress, Gavin lets his own fingers dig into the backs of R\u2019s thighs, moves to grope the firm skin of his ass; pulling R\u2019s hips to him as he swallows around his cock and sucks hard each time he draws back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d R\u2019s voice is husky, and one hand has fallen to Gavin\u2019s shoulder to curve around the back of his neck, and his hips are slowly pushing forward. \u201cI do like it when you\u2019re good for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin moans around him, both hot and mortified that the words and the low pitch of R\u2019s voice alone are enough to make him need to come this much. He pulls at the back of R\u2019s legs, shifting him backwards and down to lie against the covers. Gavin tugs the rest of R\u2019s stupid, tight-fitted jeans down and away, shoving them to the floor. He shucks off his own shirt, and curses when his jeans get caught around his ankle. Gavin can hear R laughing softly as he witnesses his struggles from the mattress; naked and beautiful and Gavin wants to kiss that dumb, fucking smile off his face.</p>\n<p>Instead, he leans back down, and takes R on his tongue again to shut the man up; pushing down until the head of his cock hits his throat, and R\u2019s laugh turns into strangled, ruined gasp. Those hands are back in his hair, punishing this time; clutching and forceful, and Gavin chances his gaze upwards and sees R\u2019s back arching off the bed as Gavin drags his lips back up the length of him. <em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he pants out against the android\u2019s hip, pressing wet and breathless kisses over R\u2019s stomach, licking away the traces of precome there. Actually, he has no fucking idea what it is. He supposes it\u2019s whatever the android alternative is; clear and tasteless. All Gavin knows is that it makes his tongue feel heavy and his cock ache where he\u2019s started to grind against the bed just to ease some of the tight, urgent tension between his legs. \u201cBaby\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t stop</em>\u2026\u201d Despite the way R\u2019s voice breaks as he says it, it\u2019s not a plead, it\u2019s not begging, not even close. He clutches Gavin\u2019s hair and <em>pulls</em>. \u201cBe good for me,\u201d he repeats, and Gavin\u2019s hips jerk involuntarily against the mattress. \u201cI know you can take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck, fuck, fuck, holy <em>fuck</em>. The curses repeat like a mantra around in Gavin\u2019s head, and he knows he could come from R\u2019s voice alone, he fucking knows it. But he will be <em>damned</em> if he doesn\u2019t make R come first, and he <em>wants that</em>. He wants to feel those fingers clawing in his hair, wants R to use his mouth, push into his throat, wants to taste the heat against his tongue as he comes, and Gavin writhes at his own thoughts as R thrusts between his lips.</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s arms are shaking where he leans his weight on them, and his own dick is leaking on the bedcovers, and R\u2019s making these fucking <em>shameless</em> sounds as he drives his hips and keeps Gavin firmly in place, and it has been far too fucking long since Gavin\u2019s done this because he doesn\u2019t remember it feeling this <em>fucking good</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Gavin</em>\u2013\u201d R\u2019s head is thrown back near the pillows, his LED flashing red and his mouth open, and Gavin moans around his cock at the sound of his name being groaned out like <em>that</em>. R thrusts again, this time hard and unrestrained, and Gavin whines when he tenses, the sound muffled against R\u2019s hips as the android holds him down tightly, coming over Gavin\u2019s tongue, shuddering and arching against the covers.</p>\n<p>Gavin swallows him down, working his throat and delighting in the desperate little writhes of R\u2019s hips as he does so. After another few moments, R relinquishes his grip, his hand sliding boneless down to Gavin\u2019s jaw to pull him away. Gavin\u2019s throat feels raw, and there\u2019s a thick warmth coating his tongue, and his elbows are sore where they\u2019ve been supporting him. But he\u2019s smiling and shaking with everything that\u2019s happened, that\u2019s <em>happening</em>, and he laps slowly at the tip of R\u2019s softening cock just to see him squirm, and just to feel the bite of those fingers when they fist back into his hair as a warning.</p>\n<p>Gavin would very happily keep rutting against the bed at this point, beyond caring about any shame it might bring, so long as R\u2019s hand kept pulling against his scalp like that. But then the android\u2019s pulling him <em>up</em>, dragging him up his body and into a kiss, and so Gavin grinds against his thigh instead; makes a needy, <em>keening</em> noise at the contact. R pushes that tongue past his lips and tastes the sound, shifting his hand between them. His fist closes around Gavin and <em>squeezes</em>, his palm moving slick over his cock, and Gavin grits his teeth at the blessed fucking friction, steadying himself with a hand braced against R\u2019s hip, and the other curled around the back of his neck to kiss him deeper.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how he comes, spilling between their stomachs with R\u2019s tongue in his mouth, and that body pressing up against his, and Gavin choking out strangled cries against his lips. It\u2019s messy, and intense, and Gavin has never felt so fucking defeated or so fucking good or so <em>fucking</em> <em>happy</em> in his entire fucking life.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t hear past the blood pounding in his ears, but he\u2019s sure he\u2019s breathing out curses against R\u2019s shoulder, because the android cups his jaw and kisses him quiet. It must take an entire minute, maybe more, for his heart to stop spazzing out and for his vision to clear and for his legs to start cooperating again. When they do, Gavin slips off to the side and flops against the mattress, one hand still trapped beneath R\u2019s neck; fingers grazing through the short hair there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou came seven-point-six percent faster than the average man of your age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin turns his head to stare at him, mouth balking open in wordless offence. A teasing smile begins to curl at the corner of R\u2019s lips, and Gavin reaches up to grasp for one of the pillows and smack him across the face. \u201cPrick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 prick. You came first, and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever fuckin\u2019 forget it.\u201d Gavin scowls as he stretches backwards to reach over the edge of the bed, turning smug when his hands brush against expensive fabric. He grabs the black shirt and cleans himself up, ruining the material, and he can feel the android\u2019s disapproving gaze boring into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe epitome of class,\u201d R says dryly, as Gavin discards the shirt carelessly back onto the carpet.</p>\n<p>Gavin, riding on the post-sex high that he is, braves the irritated eyebrow raise and the steely eyes, and shuffles over to kiss him again. In apology, he supposes. And because he can\u2019t fucking help himself. Kissing R is enrapturing, exhilarating, and so fucking hot that Gavin feels his cock twitch valiantly, albeit weakly, in response. He\u2013</p>\n<p>Sudden gunshots ricochet from outside the bedroom door; left ajar and filtering in a single shaft of yellow light from the living room. Gavin tenses abruptly for a terrible moment, feels R do the same. Before he realises it\u2019s from the movie they had abandoned and left playing on the TV. He sinks back into the mattress when he hears Butch and Marcellus Wallace\u2019s tinny voices beyond the door. His heart\u2019s pounding stupidly in his chest, and he huffs a laugh against R\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>R\u2019s smiling too. He presses it against Gavin\u2019s lips, taking one between his teeth to nip lightly along it, and Gavin frames his face between his hands to keep him near.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been extremely disruptive to my mission,\u201d R points out against him. \u201cI came here to watch Pulp Fiction, and that has still not been accomplished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin barks a laugh, still slightly dazed by the fact that R.K\u2019s in his bed; twisted in the sheets and mouth trailing along the crest of Gavin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be makin\u2019 you to sit your ass down to finish it at some point. No partner of mine\u2019s gonna be a movie pleb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA relief on my end, I assure you,\u201d R answers wryly, and the next kiss is slower, less urgent than the last few.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven-point-six percent,\u201d Gavin mutters against the android\u2019s lips, grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d R gives him a gentle shove, and Gavin collapses onto his back, staring up into R\u2019s fond smirk. His LED and the light from the window chase all the grey from his eyes, leaving them a soft, unearthly blue. \u201cYou should have spoken to me. I\u2019ve never known you to be shy about anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShy?\u201d Gavin scoffs, reaching up to brush that tuft of hair away from R\u2019s eye just because he <em>can</em>. \u201cThe fuck have I been shy about?\u201d</p>\n<p>R levels him with an unimpressed expression. \u201cAre you going to attempt to deny your attraction to me at the AXIS lounge? Your heartbeat was elevated throughout the evening, and your body temperature increased significantly after I began to share your drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay, smartass, don\u2019t make me get that fuckin\u2019 pillow again,\u201d Gavin warns, embarrassed. But regardless, he doesn\u2019t bother denying it. He couldn\u2019t; not now, not even if he thought it might work. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t <em>you</em> say somethin\u2019 then,\u201d he shoots back instead, genuinely curious. \u201cIf I was being so damn obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to be certain,\u201d R answers, as though it\u2019s as simple as that. \u201cI never close a case without having all the evidence, after all.\u201d Then he smiles, and it\u2019s that small, soft smile Gavin\u2019s only ever seen directed at him. \u201cAnd pride, I suppose. Pride may have had something to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin manages a chuckle, and tries not to think about the word <em>love</em> that\u2019s been on the tip of his tongue for longer than he\u2019d ever admit. \u201cFuck pride, baby,\u201d he says instead, and he tugs the android down for another kiss. \u201cFuck pride.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Round fucking two, then</em>, he thinks, giddy as the kisses become more fervent, as heated as before, and most of the blood rushes from his head.</p>\n<p>Only this time, R\u2019s between his legs; those strong hips pushing languidly against his, and Gavin\u2019s thigh hooked around one to hold him there. R strokes him to hardness, fingers sinfully tight around him, and moving capably considering he\u2019s apparently only done this once before, and never with a man.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, you androids,\u201d Gavin gasps out a laugh. \u201cThere anythin\u2019 you\u2019re bad at?\u201d</p>\n<p>R makes a contemplative sound, as he hitches a knee under Gavin\u2019s side and nudges him over onto his stomach. Gavin feels the android brace himself over him, chest pressed to his back, and R\u2019s lips move against Gavin\u2019s neck as he speaks; chaste in contrast with the slow grinding of his hips against him. \u201cI probably can\u2019t cook, if that\u2019s any consolation. No sense of taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin manages another laugh, but it catches on a moan as R\u2019s length presses against him, teasing and promising all at once. \u201cTop drawer,\u201d Gavin says, and he\u2019s fucking <em>shaking</em> with the thrill of it. \u201cAnd you better hurry the fuck up. Not like I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about this for weeks or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the harsh scrape of the drawer sliding open to his right. \u201cAs it is, I would prefer to take my time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any <em>position</em> to be ordering me around.\u201d The word \u2018position\u2019 is emphasised in R\u2019s amusement, but Gavin can\u2019t laugh this time as he hears the cap of whatever lube he keeps in that drawer being opened with an enticing <em>click.</em> \u201cThough perhaps if you ask nicely\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin stifles his groans against the covers, as two long, slick fingers start sliding over him. Too slowly, far too fucking slowly. Gavin pushes his hips back impatiently. It only earns him a chuckle, and R pulling his fingers away, and Gavin makes a sound somewhere amongst a growl and a whine. \u00a0\u201cCome <em>on</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d and R bites another bruise into his skin, this time over one, tightly-drawn shoulder, \u201cto ask nicely.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck pride, fuck pride, fuck pride, fuck it straight to hell</em> because all he wants is R inside him. \u201c<em>Please</em>, baby... please\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>R\u2019s blessed fingers return, slicker this time, and sliding, sliding, until Gavin feels that first, glorious nudge at his entrance, and R lets him press back into it this time. R stretches him out, the friction searing at first, but also <em>exactly</em> what Gavin wants; sharp and intense and grounding. Gavin\u2019s jaw is stiff throughout it, taking each slow, deliberate thrust until pleasure gradually starts to replace the slight unease. He shudders as R\u2019s free hand leisurely drags through his hair, and R\u2019s murmuring praise against the centre of his back.</p>\n<p>Gavin doesn\u2019t know how fucking long it lasts, probably mere minutes, but he shudders again when R\u2019s fingers leave him and more lube trickles between his cheeks, down his thighs, warm and thick. Gavin cranes his neck to the side, taking in as much of the android as he can from his place on the bed. R meets his gaze and grins. Fucking <em>grins</em>; wolf-like and delighted by whatever picture of dishevelment Gavin currently is.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t care. He reaches back for R\u2019s wrist, pulls him forward and presses their mouths together. \u201cPlease, baby, c\u2019mon\u2026 please\u2026\u201d he begs between kisses, voice sounding less and less like his own with every push of R\u2019s hips against him; his cock a hard, persistent weight against the inside of Gavin\u2019s thigh. All Gavin can imagine is the length of it pushing into him, the sweet fullness as he takes it all. \u201cC\u2019mon\u2026 baby, c\u2019mon\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHush.\u201d It\u2019s not a reprimand. R still sounds amused, and terribly, terribly fond as he drags his hand through Gavin\u2019s hair again. Three fingers press into him this time, the slide smooth and painless now, and R leans to nuzzle at the hair above the back of Gavin\u2019s neck. He continues his teasing, pressing deep kisses between Gavin\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cAre you close?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin shakes his head in a bare-faced lie, lips parted and probably drooling against the mattress, and he is determined not to come until he gets what he fucking wants. Instead, he grinds back against R\u2019s fingers, and the android \u2013 well fucking attuned to Gavin\u2019s bullshit by now \u2013 curls them inside him, and Gavin can\u2019t stifle a needy groan this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d R whispers, nipping at the lobe of his ear. But his fingers withdraw again, sliding upwards and around to dig into the flesh of Gavin\u2019s hip. Gavin feels him kneel firmly behind him, cock pressing against him but going no further. <em>He\u2019s waiting</em>, Gavin realises. <em>He\u2019s fucking waiting for Gavin to take him</em>.</p>\n<p>Too desperate to focus entirely on <em>how fucking hot</em> that is, Gavin bites his lip and presses back, feeling the sharp, sudden give. The tight burn as the head sinks into him is intensely, <em>torturously</em> good, and he works himself on it, relishing in the sting of R\u2019s fingers as they tense over his skin; steadying him, but making sure he can\u2019t quite move precisely as he wants. \u201cR,\u201d he begs, trying to push all the way, trying to take all of him, but R\u2019s grip is iron. \u201cR, come the fuck <em>on</em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>He barely has time to draw breath as R drives deeper without warning, and the sudden press of his pelvis against Gavin\u2019s back is overwhelming and urgent and <em>fuck Gavin's so fucking close</em>. A wrecked moan pushes past his lips when R places a hand on his lower back and <em>pushes</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>fuck</em>, baby\u2013 <em>yes</em>\u2013\u201d he gasps out, as R fucks into him like that; keeping him trapped against the bed, and pulling him back onto his cock as he thrusts. Gavin\u2019s hands are fisted in the sheets, knuckles white, and when R reaches forward and threads those fingers through his as he moves in smooth and punishing strokes, Gavin sees R\u2019s skin spreading away up his wrist to reveal the white, otherworldly reality beneath. Gavin\u2019s certain R\u2019s other hand is leaving deep, stinging bruises in his hip, and he <em>wants more</em>; wants to press his fingertips to the marks later on and <em>remember</em> how it felt to be fucked like this.</p>\n<p>R works his hips harder, his gorgeous little moans vibrating in his chest where he drapes himself over Gavin\u2019s back, and Gavin knows he won\u2019t last another fucking second when the android\u2019s hand snakes around him and grasps his cock. He comes again on a coarse and broken cry, spilling over the sheets and clenching down hard around R\u2019s cock; so much rawer and so much sweeter than any of his nights spent imagining this. A white, sharp heat coils in his stomach as he feels R come inside him; hears his stuttered breaths and feels the tension in his hips as he takes his fill, and Gavin\u2019s panting and grinning against the sheets because he can\u2019t fucking believe this is his life right now.</p>\n<p>Holy fucking shit, this is <em>his</em> fucking life right now.</p>\n<p>R runs a thumb over the bruises on Gavin\u2019s hip as he eases out of him, soothing the glorious ache his fingers had left behind. Gavin rolls over once he\u2019s been released. The sheets beneath him are in an absolute state, but he reaches up and pulls R down onto them anyway, kissing away any of the dry complaints the android probably had at the ready about the mess. They thoroughly ruin R\u2019s black shirt in the clean-up, and one of the pillows has somehow fallen off the bed, and Gavin can hear Pulp Fiction\u2019s closing credits from where he lies, exhausted and light-headed and wonderfully fucked-out, across the mattress. He\u2019s still grinning when R tosses the shirt back onto the carpet with an irritated tut.</p>\n<p>Mia skulks in after some time, deciding she\u2019s had enough of being ignored. She curls into a haughty ball on the windowsill and glares at Gavin, not that he could give a shit even if he had the energy. He doesn\u2019t even notice himself drifting asleep until the bedroom door clicks shut, and there\u2019s a glass of water being placed on the small table near his side of the bed, and the covers are being pulled up over his legs.</p>\n<p>He remains awake long enough to feel R\u2019s weight return, solid warmth curving against his spine, and Gavin falls asleep with the android\u2019s forehead pushed to the back of his neck, and lips pressed against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a single, obnoxious chime from his phone. Gavin curses into the pillow, abruptly and reluctantly awake. He can sleep through most things; the early morning traffic, neighbours slamming their apartment doors on their way to work, helicopters escorting important assholes to the broadcast tower in view of his window. There are only two things that can get his attention so suddenly. Mia, and the sound of his phone. And Mia\u2019s way usually involves less chiming and more clawing.</p>\n<p>Brain fuzzy, Gavin shuffles to reach down for his jeans, discarded over the side of the bed. He fumbles, grabs them eventually; dips into the front pocket to retrieve his phone as it chimes again, and he peers blearily at the screen. Almost nine AM. Jesus. No wonder it\u2019s so fucking bright, in spite of the gloomy sky outside. He didn\u2019t even close the fucking drapes properly last night, what the fuck?</p>\n<p>He brings up the unwanted wakeup call.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>-----------------------------\u00a0\u00a0</em>Saturday 25<sup>th</sup>\u00a0July, 2039 (AM)<em>\u00a0 -----------------------------</em></p>\n<p><strong><u>Tina</u></strong><br><em>(08:52)</em><br>So how did it go?</p>\n<p><em>(08:53)<br></em>Did you pussy out?</p>\n<p><em>(08:54)</em><br>Or get your pussy eaten out ;D</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gavin scoffs. Runs a hand over his face in an attempt to loosen the sleep-muddled tension behind his eyes. Fucking Chen. What the hell was she\u2013</p>\n<p>Oh. Wait.\u00a0<em>Oh fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>His gaze flits beyond his screen, lands on his jeans properly, then follows them to the trail of the rest of his clothes. And among them is R\u2019s crumpled, ruined black shirt, and Gavin suddenly recalls everything all at once. The movie, the couch, R\u2019s mouth, his fingers, his hands holding Gavin\u2019s hips down, that voice groaning out his name,\u00a0<em>holy fucking fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>A disbelieving, dazed laugh escapes Gavin in a rush before he can force a lid on it, and he collapses back onto the mattress. He rubs a hand over his face again and grins from behind his fingers. Now he\u2019s focusing, he realises what that feeling is; sore all over, legs and arms aching, deep bruises tangible on the sides of his hips. Fuck, he\u2019s missed this feeling. It\u2019s been goddamn months since the last time he did this. He likes sex; likes the way it makes him feel, the closeness of it, the intimacy. Makes him feel wanted, unalone, desirable. But still, even then it\u2019s never felt like this\u2026 this satiating, all-encompassing warmth that\u2019s still making him grin like a goddamn idiot.</p>\n<p>He remembers R\u2019s weight behind him; lips warm and smiling against the back of his neck,\u00a0<em>holy shit, holy shit, holy shit</em>, and Gavin opens his eyes, turns his head to\u2013</p>\n<p>To an empty bed.</p>\n<p>He freezes. Suddenly. Horribly. The sheets beside him are creased and rumpled; undeniable evidence that he\u2019s had company. But there\u2019s no one. Shit, but R\u2019s shirt was still here, so he must be...</p>\n<p>But the bedroom door\u2019s ajar, too; letting in more dull, grey light from the living room, and letting Gavin kindly, definitively know that his partner\u2019s no longer there.\u00a0<em>Well, fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>Fuck, fuck,\u00a0<em>fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin glances between the door and the bed for a few seconds, as though he\u2019ll magically be proven wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mrrrrow</em>.\u201d Mia\u2019s on top of the drawers, perched between the small succulent that Gavin never waters and the photo of him and Tina graduating to the force. Her tail\u2019s hanging over the side, flicking absently at the tip while she regards Gavin\u2019s silent crisis, her eyes blinking slowly, lazily. Without a care in the fucking world. \u201c<em>Mrrow</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s clenches his jaw and shrugs back down to the bed, turning on his side. \u201cShut the fuck up, Mia.\u201d His fists are tight, and he\u2019s gritting his teeth and suddenly battling an unnecessary, devastating urge to cry. <em>Do not fucking do that, not over this. Don\u2019t you fucking dare.</em></p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t been walked out on in a while, and even then he hadn\u2019t\u00a0<em>cared</em>. It'd just been some random hook-up Gavin had liked the look of;\u00a0some guy, some blonde he thinks though he can\u2019t really recall, sitting in the bar he and Tina had\u00a0checked out in one of the nicer parts in the city. Gavin doesn\u2019t even\u00a0think he asked\u00a0the guy's\u00a0name, and he remembers breathing a sigh of relief when he\u2019d found his bed empty in the morning. He\u2019d shrugged back under the covers and gone easily back to sleep.</p>\n<p><em>This.</em>\u00a0This does not feel the fucking same. This fucking\u00a0<em>burns</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin realises he\u2019s practically curled in on himself on the bed. He\u2019s such an idiot, he fucked it up somehow, he\u00a0<em>always</em>\u00a0fucks it up when he starts to care. Mia hops down and makes her way onto the bed, rubbing her head against Gavin\u2019s nose. She\u2019s probably hungry; Gavin needs to get the fuck up and feed her, but he just\u2026 needs a minute.</p>\n<p>God, he shouldn\u2019t <em>care</em> this much. He shouldn\u2019t have sent R that text, he shouldn\u2019t have asked him to stay in the first place, why hadn\u2019t he stayed\u00a0<em>now</em>, it hurts, it really fucking\u00a0<em>hurts</em>, and Gavin\u2019s such a fuck-up,\u00a0<em>fucking</em>\u00a0<em>idiot</em>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>He freezes a second time. His back keeps stubbornly to the door when he hears it creak open, hears R\u2019s bare feet on the carpet. Hears Mia, the suck-up, start purring as he comes further into the room. Gavin can smell coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand this is the kind of thing people do in these situations, to break the ice as it were. Though I suppose I have only done this once before.\u201d The bed dips lightly when R sits down, and Gavin wants to cry for a whole other reason. \u201cI was trying to be quiet. I\u2019m sorry if I woke you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He'd been in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Gavin bites out, way too quickly, and his voice sounds strained, and he needs to pull himself together right fucking now. So he rolls over slightly, and sees R sat straight, shirtless \u2013 fuck CyberLife for that fucking body \u2013 and cross-legged atop the bed; hair still dishevelled, two extra little tufts flopping over his forehead. He\u2019s holding a steaming cup of coffee between those long fingers. Gavin\u2019s heart\u2019s in his fucking throat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2018bout it,\u201d he adds, softer.</p>\n<p>R smiles, and hands over the mug when Gavin finds the sense to shuffle into a sitting position, still half under the covers. \u201cYou\u2019re running dangerously low on coffee, by the way,\u201d the android warns. \u201cThere\u2019s barely enough for another cup. I fear for the general population if you\u2019re to be living off decaffeinated products for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin huffs as he takes a sip. He burns his tongue, but promptly forgets to give a shit after he realises that R\u2019s wearing his sweatpants. He must have grabbed them from the dresser, and they\u2019re baggy on him. Gavin wagers his own hips are much less narrow; the pants hang low on R\u2019s, those sharp hipbones peeking out the top and that sexy dip of his pelvis on show as he sits. And yet somehow, he still looks composed as ever.</p>\n<p>How the fuck, Gavin has no idea.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always despised mornings after; the awkward greetings, the scramble for clothes, the hasty goodbyes, the walks of shame out onto the street to hail a cab; braving the knowing, judging looks from the driver with a glare that says\u00a0<em>I\u2019m</em>\u00a0<em>too hungover for this shit and I dare you to fucking comment on it</em>. If he\u2019s not the unlucky son of a bitch waking up in their own home with\u00a0unwelcome, overstaying company, Gavin\u2019s usually out of their hair before the sun\u2019s even made an appearance.</p>\n<p>But R\u2019s not unwelcome, overstaying company, is he. And Gavin\u2019s the luckiest son of a bitch in the goddamn world for it, and what the fuck does he do now?<em>\u00a0This is so fucked.</em> First Gavin\u2019s\u00a0messed up over R leaving, now he\u2019s thinking it\u2019d be easier if he actually had. He doesn\u2019t know what to do, he doesn't\u00a0<em>do</em>\u00a0this kind of thing. What the fuck does he\u00a0<em>do</em>?</p>\n<p>He realises, far too late, that R\u2019s watching him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour heart rate was\u2026 irregular when I came in,\u201d the android says, while Gavin takes another sip of coffee and tries to pretend he\u2019s not having some kind of freakout. \u201cIt still is. You look concerned. Nothing I\u2019ve done, I hope?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck, he sounds so uncertain. And there\u2019s a biting, bullshit excuse ready and waiting on Gavin\u2019s tongue. But he finds that he just\u2026\u00a0<em>can\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>Not right now. Not after last night. Not to R.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh\u2026 I thought you\u2019d left,\u201d Gavin admits instead, quiet, but determined to be fucking honest for once. Even though he tries for an amused, self-depreciating tone, his voice is uneven, rough after last night, and he knows he must sound lost as all hell. \u201cWhen I woke up, you weren't here and I just, uh\u2026 I figured, y\u2019know. That you\u2019d bailed.\u201d</p>\n<p>R arches an eyebrow. \u201cWithout my clothes? Wouldn\u2019t that be interesting.\u201d There\u2019s that soft smile on his face, and something agonisingly gentle in his eyes. How the fuck had Gavin ever thought they were cold? \u201cAnd extremely unprofessional, as public nudity is against the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s laugh feels strangled by the lump in his throat; apparently adamant to remain for as long as R stays.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the android asks, tone no longer teasing. He\u2019s looking at Gavin patiently, openly; no analysis, no processing, just plain and simple curiosity. As if anything about this is <em>simple</em>.</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s mouth twists. He knows what R\u2019s asking. But Gavin pushes anyway, like he always does. Defensive. Denying. He can\u2019t help it. \u201cWhy what, dumbass?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I have\u2026 bailed?\u201d The word sounds so wrong on R\u2019s tongue.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s a stupid fucking question. It should be obvious, shouldn\u2019t it? \u201cJesus, I dunno,\u201d Gavin mutters, with a little more sharpness than he actually means for there to be. \u201cCause it\u2019s unprofessional, and you give a shit about that stuff? We\u2019re partners, we work together. People at the DPD are gonna talk,\u201d he points out, because he always seems to have more evidence as to why he\u00a0<em>shouldn\u2019t</em>\u00a0have something than to why he should. \u201cBecause that\u2019s just how one night stands usually go? No fuckin\u2019 strings attached? Because\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels himself frowning deeply as he goes on, but now that he\u2019s started he can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cBecause you could do fuckin\u2019 better? \u2018Cause I\u2019m human, and we\u2019re shitty and screwed up and not worth the fuckin\u2019 time of day\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGavin.\u201d</p>\n<p>He falls silent. He refuses to look at R. Gavin\u2019s gaze stays fixed obstinately down in the depths of his coffee. But he can see the glow of R\u2019s LED in the dark liquid's reflection, and it\u00a0rotates blue to yellow in one, smooth cycle. In what? Confusion? Offence? Realisation that he could, in fact, do better than Gavin fucking Reed? Like that would be any kind of revelation.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s started raining outside; a heavy, scattered rhythm pelting against the window. Behind the drapes, thick storm clouds have stifled the morning light, and there\u2019s a fucking helicopter idling overhead, droning alongside the sound of the rain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never expected to say this and actually mean it,\u201d R begins, after a moment of that awkward,\u00a0<em>agonising</em>\u00a0silence. \u201cBut for such a competent detective, you do have your less impressive moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin blinks down at his cup, and when\u00a0he chances a glimpse at R, Mia\u2019s crept into the android\u2019s lap.\u00a0One of his hands is sifting softly through her fur.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe I told you the morning we met,\u201d R continues, \u201cthat as of last year, I\u2019m a being with recognised rights and consciousness. Do you think I\u2019d be here if I didn\u2019t <em>want</em> to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin closes his eyes, realising how childish he\u2019s sounding. \u201cNo. No, look, I get that. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 you\u2019re\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs for my\u00a0<em>strings</em>, as you put it. They\u2019ve been attached for a while. So a one night stand is absolutely out of the question. For me, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sayin\u2019 that I wanted a\u2013 I just\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs for the DPD, you should know by now that I care little for the opinion of others when it comes to my professional or personal life. And Connor actively encouraged me to come here last night, so I doubt we would get any comment from him or Lieutenant Anderson, at the very least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gavin balks, and suddenly can\u2019t form a\u00a0coherent\u00a0fucking sentence. \u201cConnor? Seriously\u2013 what, you and him talked about this, about comin\u2019\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd as for you being human.\u201d R\u00a0cautiously takes Gavin\u2019s hand from atop the covers. He links their fingers together. Gavin watches the bright, blue line spreading\u00a0over\u00a0the android\u2019s wrist, up along his forearm,\u00a0disconnecting the flesh from the reality and wires beneath. \u201cDespite your abysmal language, your occasionally undesirable attitude, and your general capacity to undercut your own worth at every possible chance you get...\u201d</p>\n<p>R squeezes his hand, and Gavin loves him so fucking much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would change <em>nothing</em> about you. Because I know you would change nothing about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It's a fucking confession. Gavin\u2019s chest is constricting, and his eyes fucking sting, and R\u2019s going to notice, of course he\u2019ll fucking notice. Gavin doesn\u2019t know what to say.</p>\n<p>So he leans sideways, pressing his face into R\u2019s bare shoulder, coffee cup forgotten and cooling in his hands. It\u2019s so stupid. His heart shouldn\u2019t pounding like this at such a simple thing, not after the flurry of things that had happened last night. But it\u2019s a good feeling. <em>It\u2019s relief</em>, he thinks. <em>Anticipation</em>. It feels\u00a0like they\u2019re on the brink of something new, something different. As though everything\u2019s changing.</p>\n<p>Gavin\u2019s never liked change. He\u2019s never liked the rain, either, and that\u2019s falling even more violently outside. But now, both are starting to feel strangely welcome to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says eventually, and he tries to ignore the flush spreading up his neck when he hears how unsteady his voice is. \u201cWouldn\u2019t hurt to switch up the turtlenecks now and then, y\u2019know. They make you look like as much of an asshole as you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>R laughs against Gavin\u2019s hair, and Gavin runs his thumb over the white skin of the android\u2019s wrist; watches the faint blue flares of the wires beneath. He brings R\u2019s hand to his lips and presses a kiss over his fingers.\u00a0<em>I love you</em>, he mouths against his skin.\u00a0<em>I love you, I do, I love you</em>.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say it out loud. He can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>But maybe, one day, he will.</p>\n<p>The rain doesn\u2019t stop until late afternoon. By then, Gavin\u2019s still low on coffee, and R is still in his bed.</p>"
