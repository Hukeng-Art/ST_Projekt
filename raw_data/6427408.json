  "text": "<p>Harry started wearing the cloak in desperation at first. He thought a couple of weeks after the war would\u2019ve done it, and the press did back off a little, but that was when ordinary people started pushing in. They waylaid him on the way to the Department of Aurors, they came up to him in shops, they stood outside in the street on Grimmauld Place and waited for him to come out. He didn\u2019t know what they even <em>wanted</em> from him. Half of them only told him thanks and shook his hand, but some of those kept coming back every so often, as if they needed another dose. Others wanted photographs of him and didn\u2019t ask before taking them, flashbulb lights going off in his face, and others wanted to show him photos of other people that Voldemort and the Death Eaters had killed, and others wanted to tell him all about what they\u2019d done to help, which generally didn\u2019t seem to be a lot, when you actually let them get down to it, and they\u2019d talk longer and longer the less they\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a whole pack of them started pushing in on him and he had to shove through and literally run, and once in a while they <em>chased</em> him. He couldn\u2019t even Apparate to get away, it was impossible to focus on where you were going when there were five people all clamoring at you loudly and trying to grab you, and the one time he tried taking the Floo, somehow a man grabbed him <em>in the Floo</em> and jerked him out into the dressing room at Madame Malkin\u2019s two streets down, much to the dismay of all concerned except his beaming captor, who seemed as pleased as if he\u2019d just hooked an enormous fish.</p>\n<p>Finally, one morning looking out his window at the milling crowd outside, Harry looked at the coatrack, swung on the cloak, and just slipped easily past all of them. He got to the office in a leisurely and blessedly uninterrupted walk, and he got to his desk and took off the cloak and stroked it gratefully after he put it away in the drawer.</p>\n<p>He wore it more and more after that. He\u2019d already been avoiding shops, sending Kreacher out for things instead, and restaurants had been given up entirely. People mostly left him alone when he was working, as if that were all right, he was allowed to be doing things for the public, just not left to his own devices, but after he\u2019d spent a few weeks successfully avoiding the hunters, some of them <em>did</em> start showing up outside the department.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, that\u2019s enough from you,\u201d Ron said sharply, holding one of them off as he tried to press an autograph book into Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWasting Auror time is a criminal offense, you know!\u201d but Harry couldn\u2019t arrest people just for wanting his autograph, so he started slinging the cloak on to go out on assignment, until he got to wherever they were headed.</p>\n<p>He kept it with him all the time, after that, and started wearing it more often than not\u2014he\u2019d forget he had it on, and if he was doing a shift at one of the desks, people would come by and then go away again without asking him to do anything and he\u2019d belatedly realize they hadn\u2019t been able to see him. He tried using it to go out to lunch with the others, which seemed like a good solution at first, but sometimes they\u2019d forget he was <em>there</em>, and then he\u2019d say something and they\u2019d all jump, and they started to get a bit uncomfortable round him after. \u201cSorry, Harry,\u201d Ron said apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s a bit creepy, isn\u2019t it? If we don\u2019t know if you\u2019re there or not\u2014you might be there <em>all the time</em>,\u201d and Harry knew he only made it worse by forgetting in training sessions, or out in the field, and then there was the horrible day when he forgot while he was down in the records vault, and one of the older Aurors, one of their <em>instructors</em>, came in and started preying on the clerk, a pureblood girl a few years older than Harry, whose extended family had produced two Death Eaters and who did her work efficiently and kept her head down and never talked to any of them.</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t notice at first, trying to figure out whether his case file ought to go under the name of the primary victim or under the responsible creature, and then he decided to ask the clerk\u2019s advice and looked up and Gorthley had gone round her desk and was putting a hand on the back of her neck and nuzzling at her, and she was cringing away in obvious horror, saying in a voice barely above a whisper, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, just\u2014stop, please, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you <em>doing?</em>\u201d Harry said, appalled, and Gorthley jerked up and looked around wildly, and that was when Harry realized he was <em>invisible</em>, and he jerked off the cloak and Gorthley\u2019s face went a sickly pale white.</p>\n<p>And Harry was glad he\u2019d been wearing it, he <em>had</em> to be, because they kicked Gorthley out on his unswerving testimony even though the girl refused to so much as admit he\u2019d done anything\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d she told Harry flatly when he tried to tell her he\u2019d support her story. Her face was hard and proud. \u201cMy family wouldn\u2019t let me keep coming if I admitted to them anything like it had happened, and we need the money, my father lost his job and my brothers can\u2019t get hired anywhere.\u201d\u2014but after that\u2014after that, everyone looked at him askance, even the ones who were just as disgusted by Gorthley\u2019s behavior as he was.</p>\n<p>He tried to remember to take it off more often, but it was more than a habit by then: it was a <em>comfortable</em> habit. He relaxed when he put the cloak on, and when he wasn\u2019t wearing it, <em>he</em> got jumpy, always waiting for someone to come at him wanting something\u2014and now they did it even more urgently, if they ever saw him, because most of the time, nobody did.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>All that first year, they were hunting the remnants of Voldemort\u2019s army. Only about half of the Death Eaters had actually been at the Battle of Hogwarts, loads of others had fled their Ministry positions and strongholds after the loss, hidden themselves away. Of course, for every one of them who\u2019d actually escaped, the Aurors got a hundred false reports, people either excited or paranoid\u2014or one memorable time, wanting to <em>meet Harry</em>. They <em>did</em> arrest that particular celebrity-hunter, and fined him a thousand Galleons, which Harry hated but Shacklebolt insisted had to be done to prevent others from doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, the false reports were meant to harass another wizard. They got a report of Dark activity at Malfoy Manor every other day, generally from people who clearly had never so much as been inside the gates and couldn\u2019t have seen the things they reported. Most of the reports got binned, but every once in a while something remotely credible showed up. Harry tried to avoid those cases\u2014he didn\u2019t really want to go back to the Manor, and he didn\u2019t really want to see Draco or Lucius or Narcissa again. He\u2019d testified at their joint trial on their behalf, of all things\u2014he\u2019d told everyone that Narcissa had lied for him to Voldemort, that Draco had refused to identify him and had tried to stop Crabbe killing him. And by then everyone knew that Harry had beaten Voldemort with Draco\u2019s wand, which the solicitor brilliantly suggested that Draco had <em>let</em> Harry take from him, so Harry could escape.</p>\n<p>The solicitor hadn\u2019t put Draco on the stand, he\u2019d just spun out the narrative in his beautifully delivered closing speech: a wizard who at sixteen had disarmed the great Dumbledore had simply <em>lost</em> his wand, to an unarmed wizard who had just been subjected to torture, and while standing on the grounds of his own house? Surely it stretched the bounds of credulity\u2014and Harry hadn\u2019t been able to say that the story wasn\u2019t true, even though the prosecutor and Ron and Hermione and everyone had wanted him to. He couldn\u2019t remember anything but desperation and panic and fury, grabbing the wand out of Draco\u2019s hand because he <em>had</em> to, but\u2014his face had still been swollen up, he\u2019d barely been able to see. It probably <em>should\u2019ve</em> been harder. He didn\u2019t know about Draco doing it on purpose, but\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to say for certain that Draco hadn\u2019t, not to make better odds of sending him to Azkaban.</p>\n<p>But he certainly hadn\u2019t any desire to see Draco again. There were plenty of other people willing: most of the Aurors resented the Malfoys\u2019 escaping prison, and Ron wasn\u2019t the only one sure they were helping some of the missing Death Eaters escape. Lucius and Narcissa had left the country three times since the trial\u2014\u201cFor his health, they say,\u201d Ron sneered. \u201cMore like so they could slip another one of their pals out in a trunk, if you ask me,\u201d even though their baggage had been thoroughly searched each time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d stick their necks out that far, personally,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cThey\u2019re far more interested in protecting themselves and repairing the family image. They wouldn\u2019t be smuggling Death Eaters out to Paris or Milan or Madrid\u2014they\u2019re traveling to be seen at parties where no one cares enough about the war to snub them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t care to argue about it either way. He let other people go to the Manor, and the complaints came in and were dismissed at the same rate, until one day they got six separate reports in a single morning that the Death Eater Byronus Shent had been seen on the grounds. Chief Auror Skadden came in to their training room and said, \u201cWeasley, we\u2019ve got a live one, we think. Find Potter and report to Redmayne\u2019s unit, I want everyone who knows the Manor grounds on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stood up from the corner\u2014he hadn\u2019t actually been wearing the cloak, just then, but he sat out of the way all the time, now, so that if he <em>was</em> wearing it, people didn\u2019t trip over him. He slung it on as they left the building, automatically, and Ron muttered, \u201cReckon you\u2019d better keep it on for this one, Harry. We might really get Malfoy this time, and better odds if he doesn\u2019t see you coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco met the unit at the gates, looking irritated. \u201cDo you lot never get tired of wasting your time and mine?\u201d he demanded coldly, swinging the gates open after they\u2019d handed through the warrant. \u201cHave at it, and if you trample the garden <em>again</em>, my mother will be calling the president of the National Gardens Scheme <em>again</em>, so if you want to endure another Ministry inquiry on Aurors causing damage to historical property, by all means enjoy yourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slipped inside the gates. He didn\u2019t follow the rest of the Aurors as they trooped onto the grounds, just stayed near Draco, who was standing at the gates with one hand on them, frowning after the team.</p>\n<p>Draco looked well. He\u2019d been shadowed and silent at the trial, pale in his stark black robes and barely looking up, except when he\u2019d stood to hear the verdict. Thin to the point of gaunt, worn down; but he\u2019d put some weight back on, now, his cheekbones not quite so sharp, and he was actually wearing clothes with some color in them: a deep green that was <em>almost</em> black, but not <em>quite</em>, and embroidered in gold. He stood a moment longer, tilting his head contemplatively, and then said, \u201cAs though I\u2019d hide a Death Eater on the grounds of the <em>house</em>,\u201d with a cool, contemptuous air, and then he stepped <em>out</em> of the gates.</p>\n<p>Harry darted back out after him and just made it through before the gates slammed shut. Draco set off into the woods across the road, pushing through a wall of brush and disappearing. Harry stood on the roadside for a moment, weirdly reluctant\u2014of course he had to go after Draco, but\u2014he didn\u2019t <em>want</em> Draco to be hiding a Death Eater somewhere in the woods. He didn\u2019t want to end up in court again, testifying to send him away.</p>\n<p>But he pushed through after him, onto a narrow overgrown path that wound through the woods for a stretch. Draco was already some distance along, his silver head bright among the dark trees. Harry trotted to catch him up as he came to a hedge maybe ten feet high, with another ironwork gate set into it, the Malfoy M worked into the metal. Draco opened it and went inside, and Harry dived through again just in time, into a small circular garden. A potions-brewer\u2019s paradise: at least, if you wanted to brew poisons and Dark infusions. Amanita mushrooms and faintly glowing phosphorescent fungi grew in tidy beds, death\u2019s-head ivy fought with charnel roses for the trellises overhead, and a tiered black stone fountain stood in the center: water silently bubbling up from beneath and softly waterfalling over the sides, steaming hot at the top and falling to cooler levels below.</p>\n<p>Draco was already halfway across the garden, passing through the clouds of mist towards a door at the other end. Harry couldn\u2019t go through the steam: he went around the outer rim of the garden instead, breaking into a run, and as he dashed, a vine lying across the path suddenly raised up into his way, and as he tripped and fell, more of them came lashing out from the wall of thick ivy behind him, loops and thick thorny coils grabbing hold of him: Devil\u2019s Snare.</p>\n<p>Harry went limp and the coils started to ease back at once, but before they\u2019d let him go, the sizzling spark of a Shocking Jinx hit the vines. As they tightened again, Draco stalked right up to him, and he reached up and pulled the cloak off Harry\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t look in the least surprised. He had his wand out, held low and dangerous right at Harry\u2019s gut, immobilizing position. \u201cYou know, Potter, it\u2019s funny, this warrant you lot handed me applies only to the grounds of Malfoy Manor,\u201d Draco said icily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cover our park, home farm, or kitchen gardens. Which means that <em>you</em> are trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of that sank in; Harry was too busy staring at him. \u201cYou knew I was there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cYou always did think flinging that cloak on took you to the heights of subtlety.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt more relieved than anything. \u201cYou\u2019re not hiding Shent, are you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I were hiding someone, you lot certainly wouldn\u2019t find him by looking,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIs that the idea that impelled this grand invasion? Lately these searches have been getting so perfunctory, I\u2019ve started to feel as though I\u2019m being unsociable not to offer tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got six different reports he was here,\u201d Harry said. The vines had loosened up again; he shrugged them off and stepped out of their reach.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDid they come from Malstoke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said; it was the village just south of the Manor. \u201cDo the inhabitants have it in for you or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked away. \u201cGreyback and some of his lot liked to go and amuse themselves round there,\u201d he said shortly. He stood frowning a moment. \u201cSix is rather elaborate, however. It seems rather a coordinated effort just to waste your time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He abruptly took off running back towards the gate, and Harry blinked and then ran after him. There were some old broomsticks leaning against the hedge, outside the garden, and Draco snatched one and shot off through the woods. Harry grabbed another and went after him, speeding wildly through the trees\u2014across the road, just barely dodging a blaring lorry with a staring, goggle-eyed driver, who probably would decide not to believe what he\u2019d just seen\u2014and across the Malfoy estate. Harry caught glimpses from the corner of his eye of the Aurors working their way systematically through the formal gardens and the flash of Seeking Spells from the windows of the house and the orangery. Draco was skimming dangerously low and close to the trees, obviously keeping out of their sight. He came to a low half-crumbled stone wall and turned west to follow it along the edge of the property, flying slower now and scanning the edge.</p>\n<p>Harry caught up to him just as Draco dived to the ground and came off his broom, leaning it against a tree. He crept slowly towards a small hillside where the ground fell away from the trees and sloped down to the wall, with tree roots and moss hanging down over the edge. As they came closer, Harry saw there was a small ragged cave behind the roots, barely a depression in the rock, and a shaggy-beared man sleeping inside, wrapped in a tattered cloak with ragged flappy-soled boots poking out.</p>\n<p>Draco stood there, his hand clenched round his wand, and then he ducked underneath the curtain of moss and nudged the man\u2019s boot. \u201cShent,\u201d he said, and the man jerked awake and stared up at him, one eye so bloodshot it glared almost solid red. \u201cThe Aurors are on your trail,\u201d Draco said, \u201cand now you\u2019ve got ward-fever. What possessed you to come here? You must\u2019ve known my father revoked permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shent stared up at him. His hands were protectively wrapped round a large hunk of bread in his lap, the remnants of what had clearly been a much bigger loaf. \u201cThey gave me the bread,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cIf I\u2019d cross the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s lips thinned. He looked round at Harry, and Harry slowly lifted a fold of the curtain of roots and vines and came in. Closer, he could see what Draco was talking about: there were spiderwebbing lines of green visible all over every bit of exposed skin, pulsing faintly, and Shent\u2019s hair and clothes were matted with fever-sweat. \u201cDo I need to keep him suffering, or will you witness he came onto the grounds without permission?\u201d Draco said tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said quietly. Draco immediately turned and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome on my family\u2019s lands,\u201d and the green lines almost instantly began to fade out of Shent\u2019s flesh, his face sagging with relief, and he sank back against the wall limp and half unconscious.</p>\n<p>Draco looked away, his jaw clenched. \u201cCall your fellow jail-feeders,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cAnd treat him gently. I\u2019ll have a lawyer at headquarters for him in an hour.\u201d He turned and walked out of the cave. \u00a0</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The next day, Harry went back to Malstoke and interviewed all the people who\u2019d sent in the reports: he\u2019d volunteered for the job. None of them were at all happy to meet him. They avoided his eyes while he asked them questions about when they\u2019d seen Shent, and when he finished with those, he went and interviewed everyone else who\u2019d previously sent in reports about the Manor.</p>\n<p>At the end of each interview, when he stood up, he said quietly, \u201cI understand being angry at the Malfoys. But there\u2019s loads of Voldemort\u2019s people still out there. The kind who really liked what he was doing and wanted him to win and want to keep hurting people now. And every time we get a report that sends us chasing the other sort, it makes it harder to find them. Just something to keep in mind,\u201d and they all darted ashamed looks at him and muttered their goodbyes as he walked out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It was getting late and colder when he finished, the sun going down, and he slung on the cloak automatically as he left the last house. He walked to the Apparition point at the edge of the town, dodging the people coming home from work, and paused there a moment. The Manor was visible in the distance up on its hill, lit golden from inside, and Harry understood without any trouble how the people here could still be angry, knowing the lords of the castle had brought in werewolves and Death Eaters to prey on them and their children.</p>\n<p>He looked up at it a while longer, and then abruptly he kept going and hopped the wall. The wards were only a faint tingle on his skin that faded right away: it was a stretch to call this official business, but not too much of one, and the warrant was still valid. He climbed up the hill and came through the gardens\u2014sadly it looked like an entire plot of Imperial Snapdragons <em>had</em> been trampled, so there went a dozen afternoons being lectured by angry gardeners.</p>\n<p>From here, he could see that it was only the dining room lit up, making ready for service. A white cloth was smoothing itself out over the table, and the silver was hopping out of the drawers and lining up to be polished. He couldn\u2019t see who was going to eat, though: all the second floor was dark, and no one at all seemed to be moving through the house. Harry had to walk a long way down the path before he finally found Draco, alone in a mostly dark sitting room with a handful of candles ablaze around him, a single small illuminated island at a desk in the corner. He was writing a letter, a long velvety-black feathered quill with its silver tip moving rapidly over the parchment, and when he finished, he folded it up and sealed it with green wax.</p>\n<p>He got up and came to the window and opened it, and called, \u201cBellerophon!\u201d The eagle owl swooped downwards, snatched the letter from his hand with its enormous talons, and shot off into the sky. Draco stood with his hand on the open window, watching the bird go, and then he frowned suddenly and turned and looked right at Harry. \u201cPotter, not that I don\u2019t appreciate your trying to hand me more grounds to sue the Aurors for harassment, but what are you <em>doing</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared back at him from under cover, then slowly pulled the cloak off, bewildered. \u201cHow could you even tell I was there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cI had to watch my back around Death Eaters. You\u2019re such an incompetent Occlumens, you could wear ten of the things in layers and toss on a couple of Silencing Spells, and I\u2019d <em>still</em> notice you. And you haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was down interviewing the people who\u2019d sent in the reports,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Draco said. \u201cI assume they swore up and down that Shent burst out of our grounds, charged through town blasting innocents left and right, howling \u2018Long live the Dark Lord, whom the Malfoys serve!\u2019 as he went, then returned straight to our house, where I was waiting to receive him with noisemakers and cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry choked half a laugh. \u201cThey had a hard time looking me in the face, actually. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it again. But you know, Draco, it wouldn\u2019t kill you to try making some peace with your neighbors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco glared at him indignantly. \u201cWould that be the neighbors who just had a bloody good go at sending me to Azkaban?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve no right to be angry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow exactly do you think I\u2019m going to make <em>peace</em> with them? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be delighted if I publicly confessed to a litany of crimes and offered myself up to be pilloried, but you\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019re a lot of families down there that look like they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cI saw a lot of medicinal potions and herbs about, and more than a few kids who weren\u2019t at school. A lot of the houses could do with some repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s face was hardening as Harry spoke, going rigid, his mouth turning down at the corners. \u201cThanks ever so, I\u2019ll give it thorough consideration. Was there anything else, or would you like to get back to lurking silently outside my window?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Harry said dryly. Draco shut the window and went back to his solitary desk and started writing again, and Harry walked away.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>That Sunday, Harry was reading the <em>Daily Prophet</em> leisurely at breakfast\u2014he got through it cover to cover these days, as he didn\u2019t leave the house at the weekend if he could help it\u2014and saw a small advert blinking on the lower corner of the front page saying <em>War Victims Fund for Wiltshire</em> with a note saying <em>Individuals residing in Wiltshire and having suffered injury or damage to property as a consequence of the War are advised to contact our offices for assistance. All cases considered promptly.</em> He couldn\u2019t help but feel glad, seeing it; like he\u2019d got something right, a hunch that had paid off.</p>\n<p>He was nearly to the office the next day when he spotted Draco coming out of a building further down the street, a solicitor\u2019s office, and Harry hesitated a moment and then hurried to catch him. He pulled off the cloak first, this time\u2014he didn\u2019t need Draco to make any more pointed digs about him lurking\u2014and got to him on the corner, before Draco had stepped into his carriage. \u201cDraco,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said coolly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw the advert,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco shot him an irritated look. \u201cYes, and if you talk about it some more and ideally just a bit louder, people will figure out I\u2019m behind it, and then no one will take the money,\u201d he said pointedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want them to know it\u2019s you?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco made an impatient gesture. \u201c<em>Eventually</em>,\u201d and then he frowned suddenly, and Harry jumped as a big meaty hand came down and landed on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d the man said, beaming\u2014Harry sighed inwardly, it was one of the hand-shakers, back for maybe the eleventh time, <em>and</em> he was also one of the would-have-been heroes, with a particularly excruciating story he\u2019d told Harry four times about how he\u2019d secretly mislaid several forms filed by superiors back while the Death Eaters had been in charge of the Ministry.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yeah, hello,\u201d Harry said unenthusiastically, while the man grabbed his hand and pumped it up and down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Murglethump,\u201d the man said helpfully. \u201cWarwick Murglethump. Just wanted to say thanks again for all you did. Can\u2019t tell you what a relief it was, to me and all the fellows down in the Population Records Division, seeing You-Know-Who go down. We did our small bit, of course\u2014why, that fellow Thicknesse sent down all sorts of orders to my office, you know\u2014well, let\u2019s just say, they weren\u2019t all filled promptly, were they, ha ha!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, unsuccessfully trying to extricate his hand. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve got to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMurglethump, is it?\u201d Draco said suddenly, and Murglethump jerked his head round and did a double-take at him. Draco was regarding him with the incredulous expression of a man who\u2019d just been triumphantly served a plate full of caterpillars. \u201cLet\u2019s see, where did I hear your name? Population Records, is it? That\u2019s right, \u2018remarkably cooperative,\u2019 Yaxley called you. \u2018Served up the addresses of two dozen Muggle-borns in three days, worth recruiting.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p>Murglethump\u2019s face was draining of color, and his whole mouth was trembling. \u201cYou, you\u2019re,\u201d he blurted. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014I never, I\u2014\u201d He threw a look at Harry, stricken.</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cGet out of my sight, you pathetic cur, before I make Potter here an offer to give testimony against you. The Aurors keep pestering my family, I wouldn\u2019t mind giving them something else to do,\u201d and Murglethump dropped Harry\u2019s hand like a live coal and fled down Diagon Alley, blundering into half a dozen people before he vanished into the crowd.</p>\n<p>Harry gaped after him a moment, stunned, and looked at Draco. \u201cWhat\u2014how did you\u2014you\u2019d <em>heard</em> of that man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI was at <em>school</em> last year, Potter, how would I have heard any reports from the Ministry? I didn\u2019t need to. He might as well have been yelling it in full voice, that performance he was putting on. Why on earth were you tolerating him, anyway? <em>Thanks for all you did</em>? Do you really not get enough attention that you need to let strangers grovel at your feet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot<em>\u2014</em>not\u2014<em>get enough attention</em>,\u201d Harry strangled out, almost choking, and then Draco whipped his wand out and snapped, \u201c<em>Expelliarmus!</em>\u201d and a woman standing three paces away taking aim yelped in dismay as the camera in her hands went flying and smashed on the cobbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI only wanted a picture!\u201d she said, wringing her hand as if it hurt her.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo and photograph your own friends, if you <em>have</em> any, since you\u2019re the sort of grotesque who\u2019ll go around shoving cameras in strangers\u2019 faces without permission,\u201d Draco said. \u201cUmbral! Come down here, and if any more of Potter\u2019s <em>adoring fans</em> show up, clear them out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The enormous coachman clambered down from the seat, all massive many-caped overcoat with a tall turned-up collar and a top hat, with nothing actually visible in the dark space between, like the uniform had taken service with the Malfoys back in the Regency and was still going without anyone needed inside. The woman retreated before him, wide-eyed, and he took up position blocking them from the street.</p>\n<p>Draco looked back at Harry with a frowning, half-astonished expression. \u201cWait a minute, are you actually so helpless that you\u2019re skulking around in an Invisibility Cloak <em>all the time</em> just to avoid dealing with these people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said, because the answer to that did seem to be yes, only he wouldn\u2019t quite have put it in those exact words.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s possibly even more appalling than <em>they</em> are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not good at being rude to people,\u201d Harry said defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a joke? You\u2019re <em>smashing</em> at being rude to people, you\u2019ve never <em>stopped</em> being rude to me a day in your life!\u201d Draco said. \u201cThe first time we <em>met,</em> you all but spat in my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not!\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe first time we met, <em>you</em> insulted Hagrid and Muggle-borns and every other house but Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt Madame Malkin\u2019s!\u201d Harry said. Draco looked utterly blank. \u201cWhen we were getting fitted for robes! You don\u2019t even remember, do you, it\u2019s all a giant blur of sneering at people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco glared at him. \u201cSee, Potter, no trick to it, is there?\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I <em>know</em> you,\u201d Harry said. He sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d Draco said. \u201cCome on, get in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em>carriage</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019ll drop you at your office, so I don\u2019t have to experience the existential horror of watching you turn yourself into a ghost to haunt us all before you\u2019re even dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>He climbed into the carriage without another word, and Harry hesitated a moment, torn, but <em>haunt us all before you\u2019re even dead</em> had an uncomfortable taste of accuracy to it. Draco had always had a gift for finding the sorest spot to push on. Harry got in. The Malfoy carriage was a small sitting room on the inside, full of comfortable armchairs and tea waiting on a low table. A cup was already pouring for him, milk and sugar mixing in just to his taste.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got money, why haven\u2019t you set up a carriage of your own?\u201d Draco demanded as it lurched into motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like walking!\u201d Harry said. \u201cNot all of us want to be shut up pretending the rest of the world doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, your solution is pretending <em>you</em> don\u2019t exist,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even lurking round me on purpose at all, were you? No wonder it was such an appalling shock to you that I noticed you were there. Nobody else <em>does</em>, do they.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flushed and looked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cHand it over,\u201d Draco said abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said, jerking back. Draco was beckoning at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cloak. Hand it over, I\u2019m keeping it for a day. You owe me for running off those two, that\u2019s my price. What, don\u2019t think you can manage without it for that long? I\u2019ll give you a lift to your office tomorrow morning, and you can have it back then, as long as you haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, dissolved yourself in acid or immolated yourself just to avoid facing the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a wealth of scorn in his voice, so cutting that Harry glared and chucked the bundled-up cloak at his head. Draco caught it and hung it over the arm of his chair. \u201cBravo,\u201d he said. \u201cOff you go, Potter, try not to shock anyone too badly by walking into rooms or saying hello or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>The carriage door swung open onto the doors of Auror headquarters, and Harry glumly got out, wondering what had possessed Draco and what had possessed him, except he had the weird and horrible suspicion the first was pity, which was probably why the second was mortification. Draco Malfoy of all people feeling <em>sorry</em> for him\u2014Harry really wanted to say he hadn\u2019t fallen that far, but maybe he <em>had</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron said in surprise when he walked in, blinking at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, hi,\u201d Harry said. The rest of the morning rush went like that. He and Ron were on duty together at the Misdemeanors Desk that day, and people came past on the way to their offices, doing double-takes when they saw him. Harry winced a bit at how puzzled everyone was, saying hi.</p>\n<p>Eventually the tide finished coming in, and they could settle down to work, but not ten minutes later, Ron said, \u201cSomething more with the Malfoys?\u201d as he caught one of the folders flying out of the chute, on its way to their inbox. \u201cWell, that\u2019s new.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said, looking up. Ron did <em>another</em> small double-take at him and then said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s some woman complaining Draco blasted her camera out of her hands in the street today. Sounds a bit thin\u2014but we might as well look into it. At least we can help his lawyers suck some more gold from the vaults.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, er,\u201d Harry said, and cleared his throat. \u201cActually, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d Ron looked up questioningly. Harry gave up feeling guilty and said, \u201cLook, let\u2019s just bin it, all right? He did it\u2014for me. She was trying to take a photo of me, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron frowned. \u201cWhat, just shoved a camera in your face without asking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cThey never ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Ron screwed up his face with distaste. He looked down at the report, gave a small regretful sigh, then tossed it in the <em>Do Not Investigate</em> bin with the other nine-tenths of the reports that got skipped for being too insignificant or pointless to investigate.</p>\n<p>They worked until lunch, and then Ron said, \u201cD\u2019you want to go out and get something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t want to, but he had to leave the building at some point. He took a deep breath. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said, and got up. Ron kept eyeing him all the way outside. \u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Ron said. \u201cNothing.\u201d Then a moment later, \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI let Draco\u2014borrow it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Ron said blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026he sort of\u2026he bet me I couldn\u2019t live without it for a day,\u201d Harry said, which wasn\u2019t exactly right, but close enough, he figured.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you what?\u201d Hermione said that night, after Ron finished telling her, to Harry\u2019s private dismay. \u201cYou <em>gave</em> your cloak to Malfoy? Harry, who knows what he might use it for!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just for a day!\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s giving it back to me tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014I can\u2019t understand\u2014what did he <em>say</em> he was going to use it for?\u201d Hermione said. \u201cWhy did he even <em>claim</em> to want it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Harry said, although she was making him feel a bit stupid. \u201cHe just\u2014he thought I was\u2014using it too much,\u201d he finished, in a mutter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, just because you\u2019re using it to get past the crowd who hang about outside Grimmauld Place every morning?\u201d Hermione said, bewildered.</p>\n<p>Harry squirmed. He would\u2019ve liked to avoid the question, except\u2014he darted a look at Ron, who was starting to look a bit uncomfortable himself, and Hermione was frowning as she looked between them. \u201cEr, well,\u201d he said, and it came out in bits and drabs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been wearing it <em>all the time?</em> At the office, too? <em>Indoors?</em>\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said lamely. \u201cI just\u2014forgot I was wearing it, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Confused was shading rapidly to appalled. \u201cIs that supposed to be a <em>joke?</em>\u201d Harry stared at her. \u201cHarry, I\u2019ve <em>worn</em> that cloak! Who are you lying to exactly, me or yourself? You can\u2019t <em>forget</em> you\u2019re wearing it! The whole world looks odd!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014you get used to it!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you do if you\u2019re wearing it <em>every waking hour!</em>\u201d Hermione said. \u201cHow did you get to that point?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opened his mouth and shut it again.</p>\n<p>Hermione kept staring at him a moment longer before she threw up her hands and whirled on Ron, who backed away with a guilty and alarmed expression. \u201cAnd <em>you</em> just let it get to this state? It takes <em>Draco Malfoy</em> staging an intervention, for who <em>knows</em> what awful reasons of his own, for me to even find out about this\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Ron and Hermione had half convinced Harry he\u2019d need to go and beat down the gates to Malfoy Manor to ever get his cloak back, but Draco\u2019s carriage arrived the next day just as he was finishing his eggs. It rather carelessly swiped the curb, knocking down the eight people who made up the regular morning crowd. Their determination hadn\u2019t been dampened by the months-long lack of an appearance. Harry thought for some of them it had just become a social thing\u2014one of them brought croissants, another brought coffee, they all stood about chatting outside his gates.</p>\n<p>Draco swung open the top half of the carriage door when they all picked themselves up and started yelling. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be run over, don\u2019t congregate in the street. And by all means <em>do</em> call the authorities, they can cart the whole lot of you away for loitering and harassment. Are you <em>littering?</em>\u201d he added, even more icily, to the one who\u2019d dropped a coffee cup.</p>\n<p>Harry made a dash for it, and got into the carriage before any of them recovered enough to try for him, although one of them did run up to the carriage and put her hand on the door, calling, \u201cWait, wait, Mr. Potter\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you care to keep your fingers, you can, but it\u2019s all the same to <em>me</em>,\u201d Draco told her, and slammed the upper half shut in her face\u2014she did jerk her hand back just in time\u2014before he set the carriage going. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to regret asking this question, but why exactly are you permitting people to gather on your porch, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t just run them off,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThey\u2019re on the pavement, not my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cGet some Repelling Yew and throw in some wild mint. To attract razorwing butterflies,\u201d he added, when Harry looked blank. \u201cYour hangers-on will back well off if they know what\u2019s good for them, and if they don\u2019t, they won\u2019t be troubling you for long. Besides, that\u2019s a ridiculous excuse to begin with. Of course you could run them off. You\u2019re <em>you</em>. You could start flinging Unforgivables in broad daylight and no one would make a peep.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to start flinging Unforgivables at people!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrow jinxes instead,\u201d Draco said. \u201cOr don\u2019t, endure the endless siege, I\u2019m already bored.\u201d He waved a hand towards the table: the cloak was neatly bundled up on top. \u201cThere it is. Are you crumbling in desperation, or can you manage without it another day, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. Hermione had lectured him for an hour, and he\u2019d promised not to use it anymore\u2014<em>after </em>getting it back from Draco\u2014and then three people had accosted him on the way home from her and Ron\u2019s flat. He\u2019d only managed to evade one of them, the other two had followed him the whole way. There\u2019d be more tonight. If he had it with him\u2026 He looked away. \u201cYeah, fine,\u201d he said tightly.</p>\n<p>When he got to the office, he did get the phone book out and rang up a gardening service. \u201cEr, would you have any\u2014Repelling Yew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeighborhood riffraff hanging about outside your house?\u201d the assistant on the other end said in knowledgable tones. \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s a terrace, is it? Right, you\u2019ll want four of the big ones, in pots, and if you like we can come by once a week for the maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd\u2014some wild mint?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said. \u201cJust remember you\u2019ll need to explicitly invite anyone you <em>want</em> to come in!\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything had already been delivered by the end of the day. Harry gratefully spotted the tall plants behind the fence as he got to the house\u2014a woman at his heels for the last six streets, talking at him without a pause about how much she <em>admired</em> his <em>heroism</em> in the war, how <em>young</em> he was for such <em>heroism</em>, how <em>heroic</em> his <em>heroism</em> had been. When they got to the gates, she finally stopped long enough to take a deep breath and got a strange look on her face. Harry opened the gate and went inside, and before he\u2019d even finished locking it, she had backed across the street and was looking after him with a longing and vaguely queasy expression.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the crowd had thinned to just four, and they were all on the pavement across the way when Draco\u2019s carriage pulled up for him. The horses put their ears back unhappily, and Harry hastily said, \u201cDraco Malfoy\u2019s welcome at my house!\u201d from the front door, and they shook their heads and relaxed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmazing, Potter, you can be taught,\u201d Draco said, when Harry had climbed unmolested into the carriage. \u201cHere.\u201d He tossed Harry a small black box with an elaborate jeweled clasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Harry said, trying to open it, except halfway through the sentence he got it open and something glowing came hiccuping up his throat and out his mouth and went into the box, which slammed shut on it, and his lips finished moving without a sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Voice Box,\u201d Draco said. \u201cFor when people in the street insist on yowling at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opened it again, and the glowing lump shot back into his mouth. He swallowed it down into place. He made sure the lid was firmly closed before he said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded coolly. \u201cDo you suppose you could endure the rest of the week?\u201d he asked, and Harry opened his mouth to say he didn\u2019t need Draco keeping hold of the cloak anymore. He could just give it to Ron, at the office. \u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he tried to imagine Ron refusing to give it back, or even so much as giving him a hard time for asking for it, if they were out together and someone started to\u2026 Harry swallowed. \u201cYeah, fine,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you on Monday,\u201d Draco said, as he deposited Harry at the Auror Department.</p>\n<p>Harry went out for lunch with Ron again. About ten minutes in, the historian popped up tableside. He wasn\u2019t really a historian as far as Harry knew, he just liked to ask detailed questions about every event of the War, and especially to gleefully call Harry out for any details he misremembered, like maybe he was lying about having been there or something.</p>\n<p>Harry said to Ron, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything for a minute,\u201d and opened up the Voice Box. The man\u2019s mouth kept moving, but he went completely silent, and then he stopped, open-mouthed and shocked. Harry clenched his hand on the box and said tightly, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s all right to barge in on me when I\u2019m having lunch, but I\u2019m not having it anymore! If you want your voice back, stop bothering me, and I\u2019ll let it out again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man stared at him stricken. Harry determinedly looked back at Ron. \u201cYou were saying about the budget?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron was a bit open-mouthed himself, but he rallied and said valiantly, \u201cYeah, er, yeah\u2014the supplies, you know,\u201d which didn\u2019t actually make sense, but they managed to keep talking somehow, and after a few minutes the man slunk away to his table in the corner, and Harry opened the box and let the voice slip back out.</p>\n<p>He used it again on the way home, for a woman who tried to proposition him. He hated that almost more than anything else, especially when they started listing horribly obscene things they were willing to do. Maybe they thought their best chance was him secretly wanting something grotesque, something an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t do. Sure enough, this one started in on, \u201c<em>Anything</em> you\u2019d like,\u201d with what she probably thought was a seductive smile, and tried to take his arm. He yanked loose so hard she nearly fell. He pulled out the box, vengefully shut her voice up with a snap and said, \u201cStay away from me, or the next time I\u2019ll chuck the box in the Thames!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stalked the rest of the way back home almost shaking. It wasn\u2019t <em>fair</em>, it wasn\u2019t fair he had to <em>do</em> this sort of thing to people just to get them to leave him decently alone, and his eyes were prickling and hot, but he was angry too, wildly angry, and when another man came towards him at the corner of Grimmauld Place, Harry didn\u2019t let him get out a word, just spat, \u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re my biggest fan? Fuck off, go and find your own life and stop trying to cling on to mine! If I wanted toadies I\u2019d get <em>better ones</em>,\u201d as rude as even Draco could have liked him to be.</p>\n<p>The man recoiled, wide-eyed. Harry shot past him and was at the safety of the pavement in front of his own house, with the sweet fragrance of mint and yew branches in the air, and he banged his gate shut behind him and slammed inside the house, and then he sat down in the hall and put his head against his knees.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry spent the rest of the week angry. People at work eyed him a bit nervously, especially after the incident on Thursday morning where a woman came in supposedly with a complaint and stopped by his desk to ask for an autograph, just in passing. \u201cDo I look like a tourist attraction?\u201d he said savagely. \u201cThis is a working office. If you haven\u2019t any business being here, <em>get out</em>,\u201d and she flinched back and literally fled the building.</p>\n<p>Nobody except Ron talked to him at all the rest of the day. Harry kept his head down and plowed steadily through half a dozen case files, none of which were even worth leaving the building. He stayed late, because at least that way the streets wouldn\u2019t be as crowded, and just as he was walking downstairs to leave, an alert blared out and the alarms began to flash: a Class 5 dangerous beast, threatening imminent harm.</p>\n<p>Harry turned and dived down the stairs to the locker rooms and threw on his combat gear with a whisk of his wand before the night shift had even made it downstairs. \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201d he shouted as he dashed past them, going back up, and Hodges nodded acknowledgement. The Apparition booster was primed with the coordinates, but there were no details yet; Harry shouted, \u201c<em>Apparate!</em>\u201d and threw up a Shield Spell the instant he landed, without even looking to see where he was.</p>\n<p>Then he blinked, because he knew the place: he was standing at the Apparition point in Malstoke, and then a horrible shrieking wail raised up all the hair along the back of his neck. He was shaking with induced fear, but he already knew where it was coming from, and real fear made him move: he managed to grate out the Cheering Charm and steady himself, and then he was racing up the hill towards the Manor, his heart thumping in his throat.</p>\n<p>The gardens were littered with broken glass, all the windows and glass doors in the back wall of the building shattered. The Fury was already inside the house, roaming the corridors: Harry glimpsed her ragged white train floating past the dining room. She wailed again, sounding baffled and enraged: at least that meant she hadn\u2019t caught Draco yet. He ran ahead to the sitting room and hit the window latch with a quietly hissed Opening Charm. Then he climbed in and crouched low as he crept towards the door. Furies were almost impossible to summon and to kill, they only came if you offered them your own heart in a horrible and complicated Dark ritual, and they only ever went away again after they\u2019d devoured the heart of the target, too. Harry couldn\u2019t even imagine how someone could have hated Draco enough\u2014hated anyone enough\u2014to send one after him.</p>\n<p>He leaned out from the sitting room and fired a Stunning Spell, but it barely made her wince away a moment, and then she came flying down the hall at him, hissing and with hands outstretched, a huge metal-studded scourging whip in one hand and the other full of bloodstained talons. Harry backed away throwing a Charm of Entanglement, which did some good: two of the massive tapestries on either side of the corridor flung themselves on the Fury and wrapped her up in a thrashing heap of heavy fabric.</p>\n<p>But her claws came ripping through in a moment, and then her head came snarling out and she drew a deep breath to shriek again directly in his face. Harry snatched the Voice Box out of his pocket and opened it just as the Fury started to scream her rage, and an enormous glowing knot came erupting out of her throat and hurled itself inside the box so hard that Harry staggered back a few paces.</p>\n<p>The box immediately began to heat up uncomfortably in his hand. Harry turned and ran for what he devoutly hoped were the kitchens, as faint wisps of smoke came threading out from under the lid. The Fury finished tearing her way out of the tapestries and came flying after him even more agitated, her mouth open in a soundless wail. Harry flew down the stairs and scrambled out into the kitchen and pulled open the freezer. He chucked in the Voice Box and slammed it shut before whirling round again and shouting, \u201c<em>Protego Maximus!</em>\u201d and throwing up a shield wall in front of the kitchen door just in time.</p>\n<p>The Fury crashed into it full tilt and started scrabbling at it wildly. Harry had never seen a detailed illustration of a Fury\u2019s face, no one usually lived long enough to get one. She had five bloodshot-red eyes and the suggestion of a sixth, staring in all directions, bright blue snakes writhing wildly for hair like a medusa, and her mouth and all the way down her throat was like a pit of concentric saw-edged rings. He had a good view because she kept trying to shriek at him. Every time she did, the whole freezer behind him rattled violently, banging against the wall and groaning, but thankfully the Malfoys must have updated the kitchens recently, because it was a massive squat thing built of stainless steel, obviously the single most expensive model you could possibly get, and it held.</p>\n<p>Harry concentrated on keeping up the shield while the Fury clawed more and more desperately, letting out one silent howl after another, until she finally stopped a moment, panting, and glared at him. Harry glared right back at her. \u201cThe rest of the Aurors will be here in a minute, want to see if we <em>can</em> figure out a way to kill a Fury?\u201d he yelled, and she hurled herself against the shield afresh, beating her horrible flail wildly at the barrier, tearing away paint and plaster from the walls, cracking the door frame. But fortunately they were down in the cellars and the walls were solid stone, so she didn\u2019t make much headway, and she finally had to stop again. She stared at him with her claws flexing and working in mid-air, her whole face twisted with mad frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting him!\u201d Harry said to her. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>care</em> why they sent you. I\u2019m sorry they were hurting, I\u2019m sorry they\u2014I\u2019m sorry for whatever they lost, whatever they went through that was so bad they couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. But it wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Fury was still staring at him, her chest rising and falling, but the writhing snake-nest of her hair had begun to droop as he spoke, her arms lowering and her mouth closing up a bit, as if she was actually listening to him.</p>\n<p>Harry stared back at her and swallowed. \u201cDraco made mistakes,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cHe made a lot of them. But he didn\u2019t make the <em>real</em> ones. He didn\u2019t kill. Even when he thought his own life might depend on it, he didn\u2019t kill. And\u2014I don\u2019t know if he tried to help me in the war, if he really meant to\u2014but I do know he\u2019s sorry. He\u2019s <em>sorry</em>,\u201d he finished softly, suddenly sure of it himself, and the snakes were smoothing into a solid blue that went spilling down her back like fabric.</p>\n<p>The Fury\u2019s face was smoothing too, going calm and oddly miserable. It was somehow harder to bear than her rage, tears prickling at Harry\u2019s eyes involuntarily as she looked at him, and then she reached up her arm and took hold of the blue and pulled a long heavy fold of it over her face and the front of her body, like a shrouding veil. Harry stared in sudden shock. Suddenly she looked just like an <em>Eleos</em>, one of the mercy spirits that people almost never saw, no one knew where they came from\u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014and then the veil kept sweeping round, and she whirled away and vanished with it entirely.</p>\n<p>Harry stood panting. His shield had come down. On the steps just behind where the Fury\u2014or the Eleos\u2014had been, there was a sudden stirring in the air, and Draco slowly pulled off the cloak. Harry almost gasped with relief, and then he saw that Draco\u2019s face was\u2014was wet, dripping with tears, stricken.</p>\n<p>Harry ran to him. Draco\u2019s whole left cheek was badly scratched like he\u2019d been hit with flying glass, and his hand and arm were bloody, the sleeve of his jacket and shirt shredded, the Dark Mark scored with gashes so the skull was weeping blood. But when Harry got to him, Draco choked out, \u201cI am. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m <em>sorry</em>,\u201d his voice breaking, and Harry put his arms round him, and Draco buried his head against his shoulder and wept.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The night-shift team got there soon after, with the emergency healer; she saw to Draco\u2019s injuries, although she said there would probably be some scarring. The rest of the team went after the Fury\u2019s trail, and they reported in an hour later: they\u2019d found the summoner dead in Malstoke, a woman alone in a run-down cottage with photographs of the husband and child she\u2019d lost, lying in a summoning circle made of lumps of turquoise, with her heart torn out of her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the address?\u201d Draco asked, and after Harry told it to him, he was silent and then said, low, \u201cI just sent her money. That\u2019s how she bought the supplies,\u201d and he got up and walked out of the room.</p>\n<p>The other Aurors packed up, carefully\u2014there was still broken glass everywhere, it would be an ungodly time cleaning up the mess. \u201cReckon we can take care of the report, Harry,\u201d Hodges said to him. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m sure the research people are going to want to grill you all day tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, and after they\u2019d all gone, he went upstairs looking for Draco. He found him in a bedroom at the front of the house, its windows still intact, just standing by them looking out towards the gates and the woods beyond.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d give you back your cloak,\u201d Draco said, a little dully, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I put it down somewhere, and now I don\u2019t know where I left it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019ll turn up sometime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it <em>will</em>, actually,\u201d Draco said dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, too,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d And he <em>was</em> glad, he was almost desperately glad that Draco had made it; he\u2019d had one awful sickening moment of thinking what if he\u2019d come later, what if he\u2019d said <em>no, give it back to me</em> in the carriage three days ago, and Draco hadn\u2019t had the cloak; if he\u2019d walked in through the shattered doors and found Draco lying on the ground with his heart torn out of his chest, horror and agony written on his face in punishment for the war that should\u2019ve been over.</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t say anything, then after a moment he huffed out a small laugh. \u201cDo you know, I am too,\u201d he said, and turned and looked at Harry, half-smiling, and Harry smiled back helplessly. He had a sudden vivid impulse to hug Draco again, properly this time, without the blood and tears and shaking, although he couldn\u2019t actually imagine, <em>hugging</em> Draco Malfoy\u2014Draco would probably think he\u2019d lost his mind. Then Harry suddenly decided he didn\u2019t care, and took a step in, and Draco did just stand there like a perplexed hatstand for a moment, but then he actually put his arms round Harry, too, and his hand curled round the back of Harry\u2019s neck, and Harry gulped as a shiver ran over his skin.</p>\n<p>He turned his head, just a little\u2014not enough that Draco couldn\u2019t just ignore it, but Draco didn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t stare at Harry, either; he didn\u2019t say anything like <em>who\u2019d have thought Harry Potter was gay?</em> or <em>I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me</em> or even just <em>wow, really?</em> He only paused a moment, and then his hand tightened a bit, and he turned and fitted their lips together. His hand came up to cradle Harry\u2019s cheek and he kissed him over and over, sweet lingering kisses, and Harry pulled him in even closer and wrapped his arms round Draco\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should probably be calling someone to come and fix my windows,\u201d was all Draco said, breathlessly, as he broke away and reached up to tug open the collar of his shirt. \u201cBut really, fuck it all.\u201d Harry laughed, joyful, and he grabbed his own shirt and pulled it off over his head.</p>\n<p>Draco caught him by the hips, pressing him backwards to the bed with kisses, and when they hit, he pushed Harry flat and nudged him to keep going. Harry heeled off his shoes and scooted himself up, and Draco climbed up after him and straddled his thighs, looking down at him almost curiously: <em>look what turned up in my bed, I wonder how it got here</em>. \u201cI have no idea when I even started to <em>like</em> you,\u201d he said, half accusingly, as he bent down and started nuzzling along Harry\u2019s jaw, kissing him everywhere, stroking his hands over every part of him.</p>\n<p>Harry laughed. \u201cI started liking <em>you</em> as soon as you stopped being a vicious bastard to me all the time,\u201d he said, wonderingly, and gasped as Draco nipped at him in punishment. \u201cOh, fuck, <em>Draco</em>,\u201d and Draco kissed his mouth again, hot and sweet, and pushed him back into the pillows.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry did have to spend the whole next day in with half a dozen deliriously happy people from the Research Division, and a sketch artist who covered almost an entire wall with illustrations of the Fury-Eleos with Harry\u2019s best guidance. They got curry delivered for lunch and kept working, asking him endless questions and making him try to dredge up exactly what he\u2019d said, the timing of when Draco had undertaken his fund\u2014\u201cIt certainly would have had a thaumaturgical impact!\u201d one excitable researcher told Harry gleefully, groping around the table for the pen that she\u2019d stuck into her falling-down knot of hair. \u201cThe fact that the materials came from his own act of compassion\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the compassion!\u201d another one said. \u201cIt was the <em>remorse!</em> It was clearly an expression of remorse which triggered the\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! They\u2019re spirits of <em>mercy!</em>\u201d the first one said, and they went tearing off again into the debate.</p>\n<p>Harry thought he would just slip out of the room while they were all embroiled, but he\u2019d barely taken half a dozen steps towards the door before the conversation suspended and all their heads swung round towards him. \u201cYou\u2019re not <em>going</em>?\u201d one of them said.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said bemusedly, \u201cWell, er, I think I\u2019ve told you all I can, and I\u2019m going out for dinner, actually\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They looked at the clock as if they were all surprised that it was half past six, and rather reluctantly conceded that yes, okay, he was allowed to go for the night and they couldn\u2019t really stop him. \u201cBut if we do have any other questions\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the office on Monday,\u201d Harry said firmly.</p>\n<p>He walked home quickly. Draco was picking him up at half-past seven, and he\u2019d given Harry strict orders to dress properly. \u201cI\u2019m taking you somewhere I can rely on the staff not to tolerate any interlopers more monstrous than a photographer for the society pages,\u201d he\u2019d said firmly. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not <em>prepared</em> to deal with any cretinous intruders as they deserve, but that\u2019s hardly the mood I want you in when I take you home after.\u201d He\u2019d purred that last bit meaningfully, so Harry hadn\u2019t exactly argued very hard or anything.</p>\n<p>It was late enough on a Friday that rush hour traffic had died down a bit, and no one came at him until just the end of Diagon Alley, when he heard someone come running up from behind him. \u201cHarry! I mean, Mr. Potter!\u201d she called, a bit breathlessly, and caught up to him. \u201cSorry\u2014sorry, I hate to bother you, I just wanted to say\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>And he almost said <em>well you are bothering me, so shove off,</em> but instead he stopped in the street and turned round and looked her straight in the face. She was a younger witch\u2014vaguely familiar, actually; he thought she\u2019d been a Ravenclaw seventh-year, when he\u2019d first come to Hogwarts. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but I want a quiet walk home after work like anyone else, all right? Is this something really important?\u201d</p>\n<p>She stopped, staring back at him like she\u2019d only then noticed she was pushing herself on a stranger. \u201cOh\u2014no, I\u2019m\u2014no, sorry,\u201d she said, stifled, and promptly turned and darted right into the nearest shop.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked, and then he turned and kept going, a bit surprised but deeply relieved. The Voice Box was still in the freezer, which had been carefully chained up and carted away whole to Auror Headquarters this morning. They were still debating whether it was safe to try and open it. \u201cSorry we\u2019ve got to take your freezer,\u201d Ron had said to Draco, a bit dubiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve come out of the bargain reasonably well,\u201d Draco had drawled, and then he\u2019d smirked at Harry and made him turn pink, just in time for Ron to notice, and then to notice also that Harry was still there at the Manor, for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Ron had said to him, as they were leaving, \u201cweren\u2019t\u2026weren\u2019t you wearing those clothes yesterday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas I?\u201d Harry had said, trying valiantly not to turn more red. \u201cLook, I\u2019d better get going, they want me down in Research,\u201d but he was seeing Ron and Hermione Sunday, so he was going to have to come clean then. He didn\u2019t really mind. He knew they were going to give him a hard time, but it was only going to last until they saw he was\u2014happy, no matter how improbably.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I up to standard?\u201d he asked, when Draco came in to get him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Draco said, and promptly subjected him to what Harry felt was either an excessively or insufficiently thorough examination, which involved looking him all over and also for some reason checking just how snug his waist was and running his hands over Harry\u2019s arms. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll do,\u201d Draco finally allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Harry said wistfully. \u201cYou could, um. Look a bit more closely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I mean to,\u201d Draco said, and kissed him.</p>\n<p># End</p>"
