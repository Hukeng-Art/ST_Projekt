  "text": "<p align=\"center\">\n<strong> <em>Steve Rogers: A Hauntology: A History of Captain America on Screen, 1946-2011</em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">by Morgan Leigh Davies, \u00a9 2012, Oxford University Press<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p>In the decades that have passed since his much-mythologized demise, historians and biographers have spent much time \u2013 and many books, magazine articles, and made-for-TV documentaries \u2013 trying to answer the question: who was Steven Grant Rogers? As with any historical figure, but particularly one who died before his time, the answers have been many and varied: the greatest of American soldiers (or perhaps of all soldiers since Achilles), the central figure of the European front in the Second World War, a tortured young man who should never have been sent there in the first place, just a humble kid from Brooklyn, a symbol of virile American masculinity, the most famous closeted gay man in American history \u2013 the list goes on.</p>\n<p>The paucity of documentation left behind by Rogers in the wake of his untimely death shortly before V-E day has done little to clarify his image \u2013 a native of Brooklyn, he never moved out of the borough, and his most meaningful relationship, with childhood friend and later brother in arms James Buchanan Barnes, evades the public record entirely: the only letters the two men would have had occasion to send to each other, during the period when Barnes was in the military and Rogers had not yet enlisted, have not survived. All that remains of Rogers (and, indeed, of Barnes) are a modest collection of photographs from his time in training and later, on the front, where George Stevens recorded the only moving images of him that exist. His voice was never documented.</p>\n<p>It would be fair, then, to say that Steve Rogers is a ghost haunting the American people \u2013 or, rather, haunting the twentieth century, for the question we should be asking ourselves is not who he is but rather what he means to us. The man Steve Rogers was has been lost forever to the ice of the Arctic Ocean and to the passage of time \u2013 and yet Captain America lingers in the American consciousness, a shadow of the greatest generation that hangs over our national psyche and that continues to chase us into the twenty-first century. We are not the nation we were when the likes of Steve Rogers walked the streets of Brooklyn \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t we like to imagine ourselves as purely good as he seemed to have been? Wouldn\u2019t we like to think that our war efforts, our foreign policy, our government were as \u201cgood\u201d as they were in the pre-Nixon era? And so our fascination with \u2013 and glorification of \u2013 his ghost continues.</p>\n<p>Starting almost immediately after the conclusion of the War, with Charles Vidor\u2019s <em>Captain America </em>(1946), Hollywood became the site of America\u2019s Captain America fervor, although notably, it was not until 1974\u2019s <em>Heartbreak on the Western Front</em> \u2013 not accidentally, one might imagine, the same year that Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal \u2013 that what I shall refer to as the Captain America machine truly picked up speed. The Captain America machine has churned out pictures regularly since, and as I shall investigate in each chapter of this book, these films situate \u201cSteve Rogers\u201d not so much in the 1940s but instead in their own particular historical moments: we see the post-Vietnam conservatism of the Reagan era on full display in <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> (1982), the rise of the Moral Majority in <em>The Song of Steven Rogers</em> (1989), and the dominance of the Hollywood blockbuster taking shape in Sylvester Stallone\u2019s nonsensical <em>Jurassic Park</em> rip-off <em>Maximum Retribution</em> (1995). These Captains America are romantic heroes, neo-con action stars, or, in the one memorable case, Jesus analogues. (Captain America has also been memoralized in adult film on numerous occasions, perhaps most notably by Dirk Diggler in the late 1970s; for more on this subject, see Chapter 4.)</p>\n<p>The backlash against these films in the late nineties and early aughts came from both France and Hollywood, in the forms of <em>Enfants de la patrie</em> (1998) and <em>Into the Valley of Death</em> (2002), seen as the two most serious and worthy films in the genre by different types of film critics \u2013 the former was never released in the United States, while the latter won nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Ron Livingston (Best Director and Best Actor went to another World War II film, <em>The Pianist</em>). Here we have what are essentially the fundamental oppositional points of view on Rogers by so-called \u201cserious\u201d students of history: the Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg vision of the troubled but ultimately earnest American war hero, or Matthieu Kassovitz\u2019s more cynical European vision of Rogers and his Howling Commandos as normal men pushed to the breaking point by the horrors of war. <em>Enfants de la patrie</em>, notably the only non-American film to take up Rogers as its subject matter, undermines the national Captain America project by de-heroizing him \u2013 and by explicitly casting his relationship with Barnes, often speculated to be erotic in nature, as intensely sexual.</p>\n<p>And yet all of this is simply another form of twisting the narrative \u2013 for the self-serious historical projects of Spielberg and Kassovitz are also mere imaginings of what might have transpired, no more real in their way than 2011\u2019s <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>, the Channing Tatum vehicle that grossed a whopping $176 million at the domestic box office. As long as Rogers remains at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean \u2013 and we cannot expect him to rise any time soon, for, despite what <em>The Song of Steven Rogers</em> might have us believe, the man was not the son of god \u2013 we will never know what he lived through, or what he thought about the War, or how he really felt about James Buchanan \u201cBucky\u201d Barnes.</p>\n<p>What, we might imagine, would he have thought about what has happened to his image in the time that has passed since his death? But this is an idle and an impossible question \u2013 for even those of us skeptical of the Captain America machine must necessarily create a fiction around the man behind the mask in order to answer it. And, it must be said: even if he did come back to life now, would it really matter? For his legend has forever been enshrined in the annals of history as the conscience of the modern nation, and consciences \u2013 like ghosts \u2013 like images projected on a screen \u2013 do not have bodies, even if they wear costumes, and even if we believe we can see their faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>Modern American(ish) Cinema 101</strong><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, there\u2019s something we may have kept from you,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cI know you\u2019re not prone to self-Googling anyway, but we figured we might as well use Stark\u2019s creepy, invasive firewalls for something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your\u2026 public image,\u201d she says delicately.

It\u2019s famous for being The Worst, but it\u2019s one of those movies whose terribleness is enthralling because of <em>why</em> it\u2019s so goddamn bad.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re any kind of Captain America enthusiast, you\u2019ll probably have heard of <em>Star-Spangled Man: The Life and Times of America\u2019s Most Unlikely Hero</em>, which is THE definitive biography of Steve Rogers.</p>\n<p><em>Star Spangled Man </em>doesn\u2019t have the patriotic fervour you see in most History Channel documentaries or whatever, and it only briefly touches on the famous mission where Cap freed 150 Allied soldiers from a HYDRA base. Instead, the book spends more time on Steve Rogers\u2019 childhood and upbringing than on the year or so he spent leading the Howling Commandos in Nazi-occupied Europe. There\u2019s an entire chapter dedicated to his political background as the child of Irish immigrants living in 1920s/30s Brooklyn. <em>Star Spangled Man </em>also delves deep into the importance of Steve\u2019s relationship with his best friend Bucky Barnes, which indirectly wound up being a huge influence on the trash cinema nightmare that is <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em>.</p>\n<p>Steve and Bucky grew up in the same neighbourhood and became friends after Bucky defended Steve from some schoolyard bullies. This origin story is as immortal as Voldemort killing Harry Potter\u2019s parents or Superman crash-landing in rural Kansas, but between then and Steve Rogers making his chemically-enhanced transformation into Captain America, the story tends to get a little muddy.</p>\n<p>In the original run of Captain America comics (which were published during Steve Rogers\u2019 USO tour and time with the Howling Commandos), Bucky made his first appearance as a child sidekick, often riding around in Cap\u2019s motorcycle sidecar. I assume this was so he\u2019d be more appealing to kids, but it comes across as a little weird in the context of more recent speculation that the pair of them were lovers in real life. At the very least they had an unusually close relationship, possibly due to the many years they spent together as a family unit before Bucky marched off to war. In reality, Steve Rogers was only about a year older than Bucky Barnes, which made no difference to their childhood relationship since Steve was held back in school due to ill health.</p>\n<p>The reason why I\u2019m spending so much time talking about some history book from the 1970s is that originally, <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> was meant to be a direct (or at least direct-ish) adaptation of <em>Star Spangled Man</em>. Authors Miriam Feldt and A.E. Lassiter were signed on as consultants when the movie was first pitched in 1979, at the insistence of the original screenwriter Harvey Bushnell. I wish to god there was some way to read the screenplay they turned out, because I bet it was amazing.</p>\n<p>Of course, the resulting movie was very much NOT amazing, but it did have the unintended effect of turning Captain America into a gay icon in the 1980s and \u201890s. Ironically, this was thanks to the incredibly conservative studio exec who bought Harvey Bushnell\u2019s screenplay in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"http://cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/captain-01.jpg\" alt width=\"620\" height=\"349\" align=\"middle\"></p>\n<p><br>\nUnfortunately for Bushnell, a historically accurate and politically insightful Captain America movie was not really on the cards in 1980. For one thing, the first Indiana Jones movie was already in the works elsewhere, and Universal Studios decided that a wholesome 1940s hero like Steve Rogers would seem like a pussy compared to the unshaven and smirking Harrison Ford. Secondly,<em> Captain America and the Red Skull</em>\u2019s producer, Lawrence Gilmore, was the kind of guy who thought Ronald Reagan was dangerously subversive. His vision for Captain America was an action hero who blew up foreigners, championed free-market capitalism, and (inexplicably) took time out during several fight scenes to make fun of the French characters\u2019 accents \u2013 just a few of Gilmore\u2019s bizarre suggestions that made it into the final, disastrous cut of the movie.</p>\n<p>Somewhere between Harvey Bushnell\u2019s screenplay being bought by Universal Studios in 1979 and the movie coming out in 1982, <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> mutated into a wildly violent, historically nonsensical, bizarrely right-wing paean to the good ol\u2019 days when a man could end an argument with his girlfriend by slapping her across the face. (Yes, Gilmore is almost certainly responsible for that iconic .GIF of vintage Captain America backhanding a 1980s-permed Peggy Carter.)</p>\n<p>Basically, if Lawrence Gilmore could\u2019ve cast Sylvester Stallone as Cap back in the early \u201880s, he would\u2019ve done.</p>\n<p>On its own, this setup was already the perfect recipe for one of the many movies that gets ruined by the Hollywood production process. But the thing that makes <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> a true masterpiece of disastrous filmmaking is the fact that against all the odds, some of Bushnell\u2019s original vision manages to shine through. Without a doubt, the most glorious example of this is the infamous homoerotic tension between Steve and Bucky \u2013 something that all subsequent Captain America movies tried to either avoid or emulate, always to rather dubious results.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the success of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Universal Studios cast a bodybuilder in the role of Captain America, a previously unknown \u201cactor\u201d named Dirk Buckley (definitely a fake name) whose only other credits were for sports equipment commercials.</p>\n<p>The reason why you\u2019ve never heard of Dirk Buckley in any other context is because he acted in literally nothing else afterwards. Put simply, he was not an actor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/Captainamerica2.jpg\" alt width=\"512\" height=\"380\"></p>\n<p><br>\nBucky Barnes was played by a doe-eyed 19-year-old Matthew Broderick, four years before he made his big break in <em>Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off</em>. His role was basically to provide comic relief, which worked out OK until it was time for his death scene, which unfortunately turned out to be the funniest performance in the entire movie.</p>\n<p>You know how sometimes you\u2019ll watch something from the 1980s and think, \u201cWow, they must\u2019ve been doing a lot of coke when this movie got made\u201d? Well, <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> is a textbook example of this phenomenon. Over the course of its 95-minute runtime it includes:</p>\n<p>Looking at this list, I\u2019m disappointed that Lawrence Gilmore didn\u2019t go all the way and make Steve Rogers punch Hitler in the face for realsies. Also, all this overblown violence and unexamined hyper-patriotism seems even weirder when coupled with the fact that Steve and Bucky are super, <em>super</em> gay in this movie. Like, super gay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.frailsistercomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/WarGames021412001.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"http://www.frailsistercomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/WarGames021412001.jpg\" alt width=\"589\" height=\"311\"></a>\n</p>\n<p><br>\nI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever made a proper behind-the-scenes documentary about <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em>, but if they did, I suspect it\u2019d be a doozy. By the time the movie actually went into production Harvey Bushnell had officially been fired by the studio for complaining too much about Gilmore\u2019s rewrites, and the original authors of <em>Star Spangled Man</em> were consultants in name only. The director was a guy who had only ever worked on TV and a handful of straight-to-video action movies before, and was clearly just trying to finish the job without getting fired like all the people who failed to tolerate Gilmore\u2019s maniacal desire to imbue Captain America with the personality of Richard Nixon.</p>\n<p>Still, Harvey Bushnell reputedly met with the entire cast in secret to discuss their roles, and persuaded the replacement screenwriters to let him work on edits of the new, Hollywoodized version of his screenplay.</p>\n<p>Obviously he didn\u2019t have much influence on curtailing such visionary scenes as the one where Cap drops a live grenade into a Nazi\u2019s pants and then uses his shield as an umbrella against the gore explosion, but Bushnell did manage to retain one shining example of his original masterwork: the implication that Steve and Bucky are hella gay for each other.</p>\n<p>I assume that Matthew Broderick had no idea what was going on here. If you look at his performance on its own, he appears to be playing Bucky with the same level of emotional attachment you\u2019d expect from an action movie sidekick whose most important role is to die in the third act.</p>\n<p>However, Dirk Buckley, the actor playing Steve Rogers, was gay IRL (although obviously not out to his employers, otherwise he\u2019d never have gotten hired in the first place) and was hip to Bushnell\u2019s original plan to include homoerotic subtext between Bucky and Steve. Along with a handful of desperate stabs at historical accuracy (for example, skinny Steve smoking \u201casthma cigarettes\u201d in the earlier scenes), Bushnell\u2019s main impact on the final movie was to school Dirk Buckley into playing Steve Rogers as if he was head over heels in love with Bucky Barnes.</p>\n<p>The end result is a jarring mixture of cheesy 1980s blockbuster movie stupidity, and the occasional scene where Dirk Buckley stretches his limited acting abilities to portray a one-sided romance between himself and the appealingly twinky Matthew Broderick.</p>\n<p>This, combined with the multitude of inadvertently homoerotic action movie cliches (pointless shower scenes, at least ten manly friendship hugs between Cap and the Howling Commandos, shots where the camera pans lovingly over Captain America\u2019s rippling abs, etc), resulted in a film that feels as if it could degenerate into actual gay porn at any moment.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia tells me that <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> made an awe-inspiring $38,000 at the box office, which was terrible even in 1982. The actress playing Peggy Carter (a singularly thankless task) went on to star in a handful of soap operas, Harvey Bushnell spent the next decade licking his wounds before settling into a successful career writing for HBO, and Dirk Buckley died in the early \u201890s, leaving behind a small but dedicated fanbase of \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good\u201d B-movie aficionados, one of whom helpfully scanned in Buckley\u2019s 1987 <em>Village Voice</em> interview so I could write this blog post.</p>\n<p>Rewatching <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> in the light of Steve Rogers\u2019 real-world resurrection, I find myself wondering if he\u2019s ever watched any of \u201chis\u201d movies, and if he\u2019d even understand how something like <em>Red Skull</em> could come into being.</p>\n<p>I like to imagine that Steve Rogers is a pretty forward-thinking guy \u2013 he fought alongside women and led an integrated unit during the War, after all \u2013 and would get a kick out of an unemployed gay bodybuilder using Captain America\u2019s warped public image to rebel against a dictatorial Hollywood studio exec. <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> is definitely funny to watch, but I hope that the real Steve Rogers would be more offended by the portrayal of himself as a trigger-happy racist asshole, than the subtext of him eyeing up a 19-year-old Matthew Broderick in the communal showers. Either way, I hope one of his friends sits him down and makes him watch one of the other Captain America films that are actually <em>good</em>, because they do exist.</p>\n<p>But personally, I\u2019d rather just rewatch <em>Captain America and the Red Skull</em> for the fifth time, and marvel at the fact that Hollywood somehow managed to churn out a movie that combines a phallic flagpole-climbing sequence, Agent Peggy Carter wearing a 1980s prom dress to a USO ball, and a scene where the Red Skull reveals that his personal guard is made up of honest-to god Japanese ninjas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">**</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 I just \u2013 look at the way he\u2019s looking at him!\u201d Steve splutters as Bucky crunches his popcorn loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2013 he looks like he\u2019s sixteen!

It\u2019s the kind of radical filmmaking that you still wouldn\u2019t find in the US today \u2013 at least, not with any amount of studio money behind it.</p>\n<p>That it managed to find a studio in France willing to stump up a fairly major amount of cash means that in its action sequences, there\u2019s an authenticity and brutal refusal to look away that many films made away from Hollywood simply can\u2019t afford. Savings <em>were </em>made with the cast \u2013 almost entirely non-professionals, most of whom never acted in anything on this scale again \u2013 and yet, of the films made about Steve Rogers and his time as Captain America, this is surely the finest. Although the accents are sometimes shaky, the acting is often astonishingly good, and the benefit of the use of actors who are not famous is that it often becomes easy to forget that you are not watching the real people \u2013 that this is not, in fact, a documentary.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strange that it took a French director and a mostly-French cast and crew (the actors playing Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes \u2013 Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan \u2013 were both Americans who learned enough French for the film to pass, and both of whom went back to the stage after this film found no release in their home country) to tell this story, but then again \u2013 it is also very unsurprising. The unglamorous missions undertaken by the characters in this film \u2013 many of which seem very dubious, ethically, to modern civilian audiences \u2013 are apparently depicted accurately enough that it was rumoured that they launched an internal inquiry in one of the US intelligence services, until it emerged that much of the script was based on unpublished memoirs from a group of members of la R\u00e9sistance.</p>\n<p>While Steve Rogers and his comrades are shown to be good men in increasingly difficult situations, they are not super-heroes in the way that they are usually represented on film (see: 1982\u2019s Captain America and the Red Skull for comparison, although it\u2019s one of the worst-reviewed films of all time for good reason). They take on covert missions, at times they use methods that border on torture, and they are often desperately unhappy. They fight side-by-side with women (Peggy Carter, a member of the English Intelligence services, plays a prominent role in the command \u2013 but there are women amongst the resistance fighters, too), and their unit of elite soldiers is desegregated, ahead of the rest of the US army. This is not a film that is afraid to shy away from history. Nor is it not afraid to speak the real truth that power would rather suppress. Steve Rogers is not a lone, macho hero \u2013 he is the opposite. He is a true comrade.</p>\n<p>The emotional climax of the film comes after Bucky Barnes, Steve Rogers\u2019s best friend, sometime-lover, and brother in arms, has been thrown from a train into a ravine far below. Rogers sits in a bombed-out pub somewhere in London, and drinks it dry, even though he cannot, of course, get drunk. It is then that he announces that he will destroy the entire wing of the German command that he and his unit were fighting when Bucky died \u2013 it is only then. His eyes are wet. He is not fighting out of righteousness, but out of anger, love, vengeance, helplessness. Of course, I was being disingenuous when I suggested that the reason that the film never saw an American release was down to its script containing unsavoury scenes of covert warfare \u2013 this was always the real problem. American audiences, or so the distribution companies think, would be much more willing to watch a film in which Captain America behaves less than righteously in war than a film in which he is shown to be romantically involved with another man.</p>\n<p>There is, yes, a sex scene between the two men, and after Bucky falls to his death we see a flashback to them, much younger, at home in Brooklyn, kissing while they patch each other up after a fight from which Bucky only just managed to rescue Steve. What is radical is that this film, made in 1998, treats this as it treats everything. There is no judgement, just understanding, and tenderness. It allows Steve Rogers, and all of the men and women around him, to be human. The characters love, they fuck, they smoke, they cry, and they fight dirty. By all reliable accounts, this is accurate. Anybody who\u2019s read any of the memoirs of the men they fought with in Europe can be in no doubts as to the true nature of their relationship \u2013 and why should they be? Love is as important in war as it is anywhere \u2013 more important, maybe, as it keeps us from losing hope, from losing our humanity.</p>\n<p>It is Bucky who comforts Steve and strokes his hair when he is distraught about the next mission they face, as he feels that he can\u2019t bring himself to fight against a group of soldiers who have been turned into monsters without free will. This film would not be as powerful as it is without this moment. It is through these close, loving scenes that we see internal conflicts externalised. The beautiful dark lighting of these scenes \u2013 many of them taking place inside tents lit with a single lantern \u2013 contrasts wonderfully with the light and colour that characterise the action sequences, which are shot clinically, expansively, in landscapes varied and open. These images say everything about the relationship which could not be said on film, before or since. But all was said here.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been ten years since <em>Enfants de la patrie</em> debuted on the European festival circuit, and soon had its only public showings in the US cancelled because of a string of protests against the cinemas where it was due to be shown. In the intervening years, it\u2019s been hard to get hold of the film \u2013 there was never an official VHS, or DVD, and the bootleg copies were of an early cut that left out about ten minutes of the fighting, with very bad subtitling throughout. It\u2019s surfaced with a big screening every few years, but this is not enough \u2013 this film is an important document, as well as a great work of art, and it needs to be readily available.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m pleased to announce that after some long negotiations, the BFI is now issuing this important film on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time. To celebrate, the BFI is holding a season where we will be showing all of the films that have been made about Captain America to date. There will be regular screenings of <em>Enfants de la patrie</em>, and we will also be hosting a gala screening with an introduction by the film\u2019s director (Mattieu Kassovitz) and a Q&amp;A afterwards. Do plan your visit today, and pre-order your copy of the film \u2013 it is a vital piece of the 20th century that we can\u2019t afford to lose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">**</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is making me very uncomfortable,\u201d says Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave it on,\u201d says Bucky, a vein throbbing in his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Sam, wondering how this was the movie night he wound up attending. \u201cI\u2019m going to... go to the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d they both shout.

There was a sad light in his eyes.</p>\n<p>They were camped out in the Ardennes, waiting: they were always waiting, it seemed, in this war; even them, even the Howling Commandos: for that was war. That was the bitch of it all. The rain was falling on them \u2013 not too heavily, but not too lightly, either. It was the perfect kind of rain. Picturesque.

You push through it and you try to survive because you know that what you\u2019re doing is right. That it\u2019s for the good of everybody. The French, the Dutch, the Brits \u2013 hell, even the Germans. Even the Germans, Bucky. Even though they don\u2019t seem to bleed when we shoot them, which I always thought was kinda funny. But that\u2019s not the point I\u2019m trying to make. We came in here because every man deserves the right to be free, Buck. Every man. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what this bastard took from all these people. And if we can do something to give it back to them \u2013 if we can do anything, even if it means laying down our lives \u2013 well, we\u2019ve got to do it, don\u2019t we, we\u2019ve got to do it.

I think you\u2019re gonna get yourself killed one day, with all of that. But by god, I\u2019m gonna be right there with you. If it\u2019s the last thing I do, Steve.

I died fighting dinosaurs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does anybody want to watch any of them?\u201d Bucky says, baffled. \u201cThey were \u2013 they were so bad, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were <em>so awful</em>,\u201d Steve says. \u201cWell, I mean \u2013 the one with Matt Damon was all right, I suppose, if you pretend it wasn\u2019t about us \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHalf of it was you monologuing about America,\u201d Bucky says, side-eyeing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, better that than \u2013 than \u2013 well!\u201d Steve huffs, going red at the ears. \u201cAll of that \u2013 we didn\u2019t ever have sex, Bucky. That wasn\u2019t what we \u2013 I don\u2019t know why anybody would ever have thought that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky blinks at him, once, slow. \u201cI liked that one,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the only one that was good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Steve starts, jerked out of his (incoherent) monologuing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cI liked it. It was artistic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. I guess it was better than the one where I dropped a grenade down a guy\u2019s pants,\u201d Steve says, and swallows. \u201cBut half of it was \u2013 was those guys \u2013 was us having sex! Not that there\u2019s anything \u2013 wrong \u2013 with that \u2013 but! Us! Doing! Sex things! \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bucky says, narrowing his eyes. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is lost for words.</p>\n<p>\u201cOtherwise it was pretty accurate,\u201d he continues. \u201cAs far as I can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 yes, I suppose it was,\u201d Steve says, remembering the war, and the muck, and the feeling of slamming his shield down against somebody\u2019s skull and watching the life slip out of his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t really like watching it. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 well.\u201d He pauses. \u201cMostly because of the sex, though. Which we were not having. At any point. In any of those places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky says, \u201cthat would have been way more fun than what we were actually doing, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve chokes on nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/37f6a24a667b086229905e121f7fcf21/tumblr_no80fl8xWa1qzip18o10_r1_540.png\" alt width=\"500\" height=\"750\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><br>\n<strong>Steve Rogers at 100: Celebrating Captain America on Film at FSLC</strong><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\u201cOh Captain, My Captain!: Captain America and Mysterious Beau Attend Opening of Film Society of Lincoln Center Festival\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Steve Rogers \u2013 otherwise known as Captain America \u2013 attended the opening night of the Film Society of Lincoln Center\u2019s film festival in his honor last night with a new mystery man on his arm. Looking sharp in a custom Ferragamo tux, Rogers only graced the press line briefly before becoming distracted by his date, who seemed distressed by the photographers, and ducked behind the backdrop after only a few minutes of glaring at the cameras. Rogers quickly followed, and the pair were not seen again until festival programmer Richard Pe\u00f1a introduced Rogers at the beginning of the screening of the 1946 movie <em>Captain America</em>. Rogers seemed bashful but game, while one of our sources spotted his date slouching in his seat in the front row.</p>\n<p>Nobody has yet been able to identify the mystery man, who, at contrast to always-stylish Rogers, was looking decidedly out of place, and perhaps in need of a good wash, shave, and haircut. Still, the couple seemed to be in good spirits \u2013 when eyes could be laid on them \u2013 and one very famous partygoer who wishes to remain anonymous described them as \u201cacting like schoolgirls in love, it\u2019s sickening, I\u2019m disgusted \u2013 quote me on that, please, but don\u2019t tell them it was me who told you, I\u2019ll never hear the end of it.\u201d Rogers and his unnamed date were not available for comment.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most intriguingly, the mystery man \u2013 who wore gloves the entire evening \u2013 bears a striking resemblance to Rogers\u2019 deceased comrade James Buchanan \u201cBucky\u201d Barnes, with whom Rogers is speculated to have had, in the parlance of the day, relations. Could this be a confirmation that the old roommates were more than just friends? Some might say that finding a twenty-first century replacement for a long-dead flame is a little creepy \u2013 but we think it\u2019s more than a little bit romantic. Let the fanfiction writing commence.</p>"
