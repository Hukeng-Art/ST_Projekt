  "text": "<p>Izuku\u2019s quirk showed itself when he was four and a half, nearly five, literally <em>showed</em> itself. In the form of wings, large white speckled wings, it was a horrible experience of which he would never wish on another human soul, appendages tearing through his back, the only thing worse then having appendages tearing through your back is having it done alone, Izuku\u2019s mother had passed away shortly before his manifestation, car accident, and Izuku had been so terrified of the people in suits that he fled, he ran, he ran as fast as his little legs could carry him, until he found a place to hide.</p>\n<p>A hole in an old building, falling apart around him, but still somewhat whole, he found a small section with a small covering of the roof over it, and set up shop.</p>\n<p>He slowly piled together different soft materials he could find, discarded blankets and hoodies, he found a pillow once, he made himself a little nest from old blankets and lost hoodies, and his single pillow, and slept contentedly, as contentedly as a winged four year old could sleep.</p>\n<p>Izuku, being an intelligent four year old, collected little metal pieces from Dagobah beach to sell for scrap to earn a few yen to buy himself food, he cut holes in the too big hoodies to accommodate his wings when he decided to go out. People would watch him walk passed, with his small white speckled wings and oversized hoodies, but never stopped him, for which he was grateful.</p>\n<p>He had a calendar, and he decided, one afternoon as he ate from a cup of ramen, that he\u2019d learn to fly when he turned five.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy birthday, Izu.\u201d The small newly aged five year old whispers to himself in his nest of blankets and hoodies, a small cupcake resting on a notebook, a single candle flickering in the darkness of the disappearing sun beyond the horizon, the cupcake had been a bit much, he\u2019d had a tough time deciding between the cupcake and a cup of noodles, but it was his birthday, and he wanted something good for his birthday, so he went without the noodles in favor of the cupcake. \u201cI miss you mommy. I\u2019m five today. I love you mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blows the candle out with a small puff, and smiles, carefully pulling it out from the top of the treat, setting it aside, outside of his nest, and peeled the paper off, taking a bite of the sweet cake, he giggles when icing sticks to his nose and tries to lick it off for a minute before wiping it up with a finger and licking it off from there. He eats his cupcake slowly, wanting to savor it, not wanting to eat it too fast and not enjoy it.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finished, he licks his fingers clean, rubs his hands on the front of the oversized hoodie he\u2019s wearing, and slowly curls up, reaching for his pillow, curling his wings around him for some warmth, and settles down.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>He awakes the next morning, early, but not too early, the sun\u2019s been up longer then him, and yawns, stretching his arms and wings out wide, rubbing at his eyes as he looks around his corner, leaning over the edge of his next for the small pocket sized photo tucked safely in his shoe, and smiles down at it. \u201cHi mommy.\u201d He rubs at his eyes when a small tear splashes down on the picture. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try and fly today. Wish me luck mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scurrying out of his nest, he sets the small photo down on the windowsill and tugs his hoodie off, exchanging the Gang Orca hoodie for a Hawks hoodie, he figured it was good luck, because Hawks had wings and he could fly, and he had wings and he was going to fly too. Carefully stuffing his feet in his sneakers, he ties them, and reaches for his photo, tucking it in the hoodie pocket, he pulls the hood up, and carefully makes his way out of his little hidey hole home.</p>\n<p>He wanders through the crowd, wings tucked in close, so people don\u2019t touch them, the hood of his too big Hawks hoodie shielding him from prying eyes, and he weaves his way through the crowd towards the park, lots of open space to try flying like he told mommy he was going to do.</p>\n<p>The park was nearly empty, a few kids were playing on the swings, but other than that, it was deserted.</p>\n<p>The small winged boy isn\u2019t really sure how to start or what to do, and stands next to the slide in contemplation, looking around the park.</p>\n<p>He could swing really high and jump off and try.</p>\n<p>He could climb to the top of the jungle gym and jump off and try.</p>\n<p>Izuku taps his lip thoughtfully, before shrugging, pulling his picture out to press a quick good luck kiss to it, he tucks it back in his pocket, and carefully climbs up the jungle gym, he finds, as he stands at the top, wind blowing through his feathers, that its much higher then he thought it was, and he stares down at the ground that seems <em>soo</em> far away.</p>\n<p>Closing his eyes, he asks mommy for good luck, opens his wings, and jumps\u2014\u201cWoah, baby bird.\u201d He yelps as he snatched up mid air and immediately curls up. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not gonna hurt you.\u201d Slowly, he peeks, taking note of the arms curled around him, and the ground, something of which he is not standing on, before he looks up, and smiles when Hawks smiles. \u201cGotta learn to fly before you jump, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles brightly and waves a small hand at the winged hero. \u201cHi!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawks chuckles softly. \u201cHi.\u201d He slowly lowers them to the ground but noticeably doesn\u2019t put the small winged child down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Izuku!\u201d He holds up a hand proudly, with all five fingers, and grins. \u201cI\u2019m five!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Izuku, it\u2019s nice to meet you, I\u2019m Keigo, I\u2019m twenty-two.\u201d He bounces the boy lightly. \u201cSo, you\u2019re trying to fly for the first time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods slightly. \u201cYea, I told mommy I was gonna do it, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s here?\u201d The hero looks around. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p>\n<p>The small greenette leans back to fish into the pocket of his overly large Hawks hoodie for his small photo and shows it to the man. \u201cHere!\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo takes one look at the photo and takes the proclamation that comes with it, and his heart <em>drops, </em>it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out how to put those pieces together. He doesn\u2019t let the sadness seep through though, he keeps it to himself, and smiles at the photo. \u201cShe\u2019s really pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she!\u201d Izuku pulls the old worn photo around and smiles at it. \u201cI love mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she loves you too, Izuku, you look just like her.\u201d A small sad silence settles over them and he takes a moment to figure out how to break it. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>The child\u2019s face lights up, and he stuffs his photo back into his hoodie pocket and curls his small hands over his shoulders. \u201cReally!\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles at the child\u2019s exuberance. \u201cReally!\u201d The blonde leans over to set the small boy on his feet. \u201cOkay, do what I do, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods firmly, the look of pure determination that overcomes his babyface is utterly adorable, and he resists the urge to take a picture of it with great difficulty. \u201cOkay!\u201d He bites his lip, opening his wings in the same fashion the man does, and sweeps them downwards in the same fashion, yelping when he lifts himself from the ground. \u201cGood Izuku, now, keep beating your wings in a sweeping motion.\u201d The hero lifts himself just a bit higher and holds his hands out. \u201cFly up to me, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>The five year old nods slightly, and practices for a moment, before kicking off the ground, sweeping his wings like he was told to, it\u2019s shaky, but he meets the outstretched hands, smiling when they curl around his middle and snag him up. \u201cYou did it, baby bird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did it! I did it!\u201d Izuku claps excitedly and jumps forward, hugging his arms around the pro\u2019s neck tightly, pressing their cheeks together. \u201cThank you, big bird!\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles, hugging the little fledgling closer. \u201cYour mom is so proud of you, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little bird falls silent for a moment and sniffles softly. \u201cI miss mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, baby bird.\u201d Keigo curls a hand around the back of the boy\u2019s head, curling his wings around them, squeezing him closer. \u201cShe misses you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls back, tears make his green eyes shimmer. \u201cMommy told me to stay with Auntie \u2018Suki and Kacchan and said she\u2019d be right back, she had to go to the store, and then a long time passed, and these guys in blue suits came and said mommy had been in an accident and Auntie \u2018Suki started crying and Kacchan got angry when the guys said they were gonna take me away and Auntie \u2018Suki started yellin\u2019 and Kacchan took me to his window and pushed it open and told me to run \u2018cause he didn\u2019t want me to get a mean new mommy and daddy so I climbed out and ran and hid from the guys in blue suits so they couldn\u2019t take me away to a mean new mommy and daddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby bird,\u201d he choses his words very carefully. \u201cDo you have a new mom and dad; do they know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d The greenette chirps and shakes his head, patting the pocket of his hoodie. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Keigo tilts his head. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head. \u201cNo, mommy\u2019s here too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s just you and your mom,\u201d the winged man asks. \u201cNo one else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d He chirps again. \u201cJust me and mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Concern fills him for the little baby bird at the implications of that statement. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea!\u201d Izuku smiles and nods. \u201cWe are a\u2026..what\u2019s it called\u2026umm\u2026.a\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlock?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea!\u201d Izuku nods again. \u201cYou got wings and I got wings and birds have wings and more then one bird is a flock and there\u2019s two of us and we\u2019re like birds and that means we\u2019re a flock!\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles at him. \u201cWe sure are. Can you show big bird where you and mommy live?\u201d</p>\n<p>The little winged boy nods lightly. \u201cYep!\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo nods and lands, setting the child on his feet, smiling at the feeling of little fingers curling around his. \u201cLead the way, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my window, and this is my table, and this is my cup, and this is my nest!\u201d His heart breaks at the accommodations the excitable child has as he shows him everything, he looks down when the small child holds a book up to him. \u201cAnd, this is my bird book, I like it, \u2018cause I like birds, Kacchan used to say that it was silly because I was like a bird and I liked birds and Auntie \u2018Suki showed me what bird I was like!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yea?\u201d He squats down and smiles at him. \u201cWhich bird are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles a big smile. \u201cI\u2019m like a snow owl, cause my wings are white with black dots, and a snow owl has white wings with black dots.\u201d The five year old opens his bird book and flips through the pages until he finds the one he\u2019s looking for, pointing at a bird, a red-tailed hawk. \u201cThis is you! \u2018Cause your name is Hawks and you have red wings and this one is a hawk, and it has red wings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really smart, baby bird.\u201d Keigo taps the picture of the hawk. \u201cThat\u2019s my bird, alright.\u201d He looks around the small little home made up in a corner with a lone awning of a roof, and points at the mound of old blankets and lost hoodies. \u201cThis is your nest?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bright child nods happily, closing his bird book and hugging it to his chest, and pokes the mound with his foot. \u201cYea! I made it all on my own! I made it outta lost stuff!\u201d He turns and gives him the most serious look he\u2019s ever seen on a five year old\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019 steal any of it! I found it all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he holds up his hands in surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you did, and I most certainly didn\u2019t say so.\u201d He hums deeply, he can\u2019t in good conscience leave a <em>five year old</em> out here on his own, legally, as a hero, he\u2019s obligated to take him in, he\u2019s technically a runaway, but the little bird has already been through so much, and he was adorable, and they were apparently a flock, as the child had proclaimed, and he didn\u2019t really <em>want</em> to give up his new baby bird. \u201cI have a nest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bright green eyes meet his. \u201cYou do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, it\u2019s a <em>big</em> nest!\u201d He spreads his arms and wings. \u201c<em>This</em> big!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That</em> big!\u201d The five year old leans against his knees. \u201cThat\u2019s <em>really</em> big, big bird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a big bird, I need a big nest, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tilts his head and thinks, his thinking face is adorable, if he could, he\u2019d take a picture. \u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo smiles at him. \u201cWanna come see <em>my</em> nest, I mean, you showed me <em>yours</em>, can I show you <em>mine</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I!\u201d The little bird bounces slightly. \u201cI wanna see your nest!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, you can,\u201d the child shrieks when he stands, scooping him up with him, cradling him in his arms. \u201cYou can try out my nest and tell me which one you like better.\u201d</p>\n<p>The winged child nods. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Keigo\u2019s not really sure how he\u2019d left his apartment with the intention of getting some fast food, probably KFC, he likes fried chicken, fucking sue him, and ended up returning with no food, and a small five year old winged child, feathers and curls damp from a bath, wearing one of his old t-shirts.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s learned not to question fate.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is <em>my</em> nest.\u201d He waves a hand at the large pit filled with pillows and blankets, the small boy standing at his side, the fingers of his right hand curled in the leg of his pajama pants. \u201cI told you it was big, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>really</em> big!\u201d Izuku grins up at him. \u201cBut, you\u2019re a big bird, so you need a big nest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, too.\u201d He leans over and scoops the boy up under the arms. \u201cTry it out.\u201d And tosses him into the mess of pillows and blankets.</p>\n<p>Izuku shrieks, as he\u2019s thrown forward, kicking his legs and waving his arms, giggling brightly when he lands on a large soft pillow, and rights himself.</p>\n<p>The hero smiles at his giggles and drops down himself, grunting softly when he lands, he flops over and just sprawls out, spreading his arms and wings out wide, closes his eyes, and just lays there. Listening to the soft giggles, it\u2019s heartwarming, his apartment had always been so <em>quiet</em>, he likes the soft giggling. He doesn\u2019t move when he feels a small body climb up on top of him, a light weight laying on his chest, and smiles when a finger pokes his cheek, opening his eyes to meet the baby bird\u2019s.</p>\n<p>He giggles down at him. \u201cI like you, big bird, and I like your nest too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, you like me?\u201d Izuku giggles and nods, Keigo smiles at him, curling his arms and wings around them as he rolls them over, resting on his elbows above the small child. \u201cWell, I like you too, baby bird.\u201d He leans in closer and they stare at each other, until Izuku licks his nose and giggles again, as he makes a face and leans back. \u201cYou little\u2026\u201d The winged child squeals brightly when he tickles his sides and squirms, pushing at his chest as much as he can, and he chuckles. \u201cSay you\u2019re sorry, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2014Sohohohorry! S\u2014S\u2014Sohohohorry, bihihihig bihihihird!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops, after another minute, because the kid\u2019s bright laughter is adorable, and leans in to lick his nose lightly in revenge. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods. \u201cYea!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he rolls off the five year old and sits up, raising his arms when the boy follows, and climbs up to sit in his lap, lowering his arms to curl around him. \u201cWhat\u2019re hungry for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d The greenette shrugs. \u201cCan we have something other then noodles though because I eat noodles all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea, sure, we can have something other then noodles.\u201d The blonde nods lightly, hugging the small boy close. \u201cI really want some chicken, have you ever had chicken before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods and tilts his head back to look up at him. \u201cYea, I like chicken nuggets!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, baby bird, you\u2019re gonna fit right in!\u201d He smiles when the boy giggles when he uses his wings to lift himself to his feet, taking him up with him, and settles him on his hip as he steps out of their nest. \u201cLet me get my phone and we can order some.\u201d Keigo leans forward when they\u2019re close enough to the island to scoop up his phone, and one handedly, he opens the doordash app, and leans back against the counter as he scrolls through the restaurant list for his favorite chicken place. Izuku curls his arm over his shoulder and leans in closer to watch him scroll down the list as he chews on his fingers, until he finds it, and selects it, then scrolls through the menu. He himself wants hot wings and adds nuggets to the cart for the fledgling. \u201cWant some fries?\u201d</p>\n<p>The small boy nods, and his curls brush against his cheek when he leans in closer to watch him tap things he wants, he confirms their order, and turns to the boy resting on his hip, Izuku smiles at him around his fingers, and he returns his smile, leaning in to peck his nose, before turning to set his phone back on the island. \u201cNow, we just wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tot pulls his fingers out of his mouth. \u201cThanks for bringing me, big bird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, baby bird.\u201d Keigo turns back to the white winged boy. \u201cHow would you feel about staying here, I got enough room, and I\u2019m kind of attached to my baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can <em>stay</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cIf you want to, I can find you another home if want, but if you wanna stay here, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna stay!\u201d Izuku smiles widely. \u201cWe\u2019re a flock!

Izuku shrieks and squeals when he tickles his belly, bringing them to hover in the air, and he holds him out, smiling as the little bird spreads his white speckled wings wide. \u201cCaught you, baby bird!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPapa, you\u2019re a cheater!\u201d Izuku cries out in a fit of giggles. \u201cYou cheated!\u201d</p>\n<p>He chuckles softly. \u201cHow do you cheat in tag?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, but you did!\u201d</p>\n<p>The five year old flaps his wings and pulls out of his grip, leaning forward, until they\u2019re face to face, and licks his nose, giggling as he darts away when he yells playfully, and makes chase again. He follows the little bird to the balcony of their penthouse apartment, Izuku lands roughly, stumbling as he runs through the doors, and he lands behind him, continuing the chase, and swoops the five year old up before he can reach the safety of the nest, the safe zone, and he shrieks as he\u2019s tossed up, flapping his wings to keep himself airborne.</p>\n<p>The hero stares up at him. \u201cYou know the rules, mister, no flying in the apartment.\u201d Keigo catches the fledgling when he tucks his wings in and drops, pulling him in close. \u201cDid you have fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles and nods, rubbing at the scruff on his chin. \u201cLike flyin\u2019 with you, papa!\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrieks softly when he tries to bite his fingers. \u201cI like flying with you too, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku hides in papa bird\u2019s shoulder as they approach the big building, he\u2019s not <em>scared</em>, he\u2019s <em>not</em>, he just <em>wants</em> to hide in papa bird\u2019s shoulder, that\u2019s <em>all</em>. The fingers of his right hand curled in the back of the man\u2019s shirt, the fingers of his left hand in his mouth, watching the big kids walk passed them silently.</p>\n<p>Papa bird opens a door, and walks up some stairs, the door closing behind them, the room is dark, not too dark, he can still see, and there\u2019s big tv\u2019s on the front wall, and chairs, some of them are empty, and he perks up slightly when he sees people, heroes, like papa bird.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, Takami,\u201d both man and child turn at the call of a woman, Izuku thinks she\u2019s pretty, and she waves at him, he doesn\u2019t wave back, but he does smile at her around his fingers. \u201cIs this your mysterious baby bird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea, this is him.\u201d He turns when papa bird turns, smiling when he kisses him on the nose lightly, before turning back to the woman. \u201cIzuku, this is Kayama, she\u2019s Midnight, you remember me telling you about her, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d The tyke nods. \u201cShe puts people to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Takami, you told him about me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls his fingers out of his mouth and waves at her. \u201cYou\u2019re really pretty, Ms. Midnight!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwww, baby bird!\u201d Midnight coos softly. \u201cCall me Auntie Nemuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay Auntie Nemuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ve got a little little listener joining us today!\u201d The little winged boy turns in the direction of the new voice, at another blonde man, who smiles and waves at him. \u201cYou can call me Uncle Hizashi, little bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks over when Keigo pokes his belly. \u201cYou remember who I said he was, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cPresent Mic!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwwww!\u201d The voice hero gushes. \u201cHe knows me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA small problem child is among us?\u201d Izuku turns to see a dark haired man in black clothes with a large grey scarf, and smiles, waving at him over papa bird\u2019s shoulder, the man smiles lightly and waves back. \u201cYou can call me Uncle Shouta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Uncle Shouta!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t Hawks and his mysterious baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>The winged boy smiles and waves at the stoat in the big chair. \u201cHi, Uncle Nedzu!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, little Takami, it\u2019s a pleasure to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He giggles and nods, fingers returning to his mouth. \u201cYou too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is there a child here?\u201d A sickly looking blonde man inquires as he enter\u2019s and everyone turns to look at him. \u201cIs that truly a good idea, children have a habit of chattering, he might reveal sensitive materiel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo curls a wing around his kid protectively. \u201cHe\u2019s my son, All Might.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might nods. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been best to have someone watch over him instead of bringing him here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving my son in the care of strangers.\u201d He shakes his head firmly, his wing twitching when little fingers curl in his feathers, and pushes it back slightly so green eyes can peer out from behind it. \u201cHe goes where I go. Very few people know about him, for his safety, and I\u2019m not allowing someone who might go blabbing about him watch over him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d All Might starts. \u201cHe could have been left with another hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d the winged hero shakes his head. \u201cNishiya was busy with his new sidekicks and Rumi is on a mission. He\u2019s staying, get over it.\u201d He looks at his baby bird and smiles when he sticks his tongue out at the number one hero and blows a raspberry. \u201cYea, you tell\u2019em, baby bird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midnight laughs softly, giving the baby bird a thumbs up when Hawks turns to claim his seat between Nedzu and Eraserhead, settling the boy on his lap and giving him his phone to entertain himself with, Izuku is a godsend, he does not require to <em>be</em> entertained, he is perfectly capable of entertaining himself, give him your phone, and he\u2019ll be entertained for hours.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>The first day of class is something, it truly is, he dresses himself in his hero costume, as was the way, and because he thinks he\u2019s hilarious, he dresses Izuku in a Hawks t-shirt and a pair of pants, the owlet wanted to go barefoot, so he said what the heck, and let him go barefoot.</p>\n<p>At every opportunity, All Might took the time to tell him how it was a bad idea to have a child with them, and at every opportunity, he kindly told him to shut up and his kid would blow a raspberry at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI AM ENTERING THROUGH THE DOOR LIKE A NORMAL PERSON!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles when he groans, and immediately curls a small hand around his mouth when he turns to glare at him playfully, following after the older hero into class 1-As homeroom. The students perk up at the sight of a small winged boy sitting on the number three hero\u2019s arm chewing on his fingers, the greenette surveys them all. The girls coo softly when he ducks into the winged hero\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Hawks groans again, and glares at the boy once more when he giggles again, causing the girls to coo and aw, but he\u2019s smiling when he turns back around. \u201cAll Might, normal people don\u2019t announce themselves when they enter a room.\u201d The greenette smacks a small hand over his mouth and giggles softly and the room smiles at the sound of it. \u201cOkay, everyone, we\u2019re your heroics teachers, put on your hero costumes and meet us down in Beta three, you\u2019ve got ten minutes.\u201d He turns out of the room, heading for the simulation joint, and smiles down at the small child, tickling his belly lightly, making him giggle again. \u201cYou like seeing me suffer don\u2019t you, baby bird?\u201d The small child giggles and leans up to kiss his cheek. \u201cAww, baby bird, I forgive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might\u2019s following after them, he can hear him, but chooses to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Entering the viewing room for the mock city, Izuku stretches, stretching his arms and wings wide, and yawns, flopping forward against his shoulder, ah, naptime.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku quickly comes to the conclusion that All Might is just like the men in blue suits who wanted to take him away when he introduces him to two men in black suits.</p>\n<p>\u201cTakami, these nice gentlemen are going to watch over you today while your father works.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, he may only be five years old, but he\u2019s a very good judge of character, and he knows, that the way the two men in black suits are watching him makes them bad people.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother kid with an avian quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other man nods sharply. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s able to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man next to him nods too. \u201cHe could be another success story, like our first avian quirked kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku knows, at the very first word, that he wants two of two things, one, to be very far away from them, and two, papa. He screams when one of the two mean men in black suits reaches out for him, jumping backwards, wings flaring in what is intended to be a threatening manner, but the one man steps forward, and snags his arm when he\u2019s close enough, and he screams again when he doesn\u2019t let go, a sob tearing from his chest when he\u2019s pulled forward, and the other man grabs his other arm, nodding at the number one hero. \u201cThank you, All Might, we\u2019ll most certainly provide him with supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p>He struggles, flapping his wings wildly, tearing and tugging at his arms, dragging his heels, screaming and sobbing in terror as the two men drag him down the hall.</p>\n<p>And, then it happens, the temperature in the hall drops drastically, it starts <em>snowing</em> in the hallway, and the two men let go and shake their hands, their palms frostbitten, he knows what it looks like, he\u2019s been frost bitten before.</p>\n<p>They snarl at him and reach out with their other hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to have any representatives from the Hero Commission visiting U.A.\u201d He\u2019s never been more relieved to hear Uncle Nedzu\u2019s voice. \u201cBut, it is standard protocol for guests to be brought to my office before given access to the rest of the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the men\u2019s surprise at being caught, Izuku darts around, running for the legs of the nearest person, and sobs when Uncle Ryo picks him up, whispering soothingly, letting him curl around him as best as he can, arms, legs, and wings.</p>\n<p>The man with red hair in a black suit regards the stoat cautiously. \u201cHe\u2019s not a student, Nedzu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nedzu shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re correct, his is not, but he is the child of one of my teachers, and therefore has the same protection.\u201d His gaze sharpens. \u201cYou are not permitted to take anyone off my campus without my expressed permission, that was the agreement made between myself and the president, and I happen to know you did not discuss his removal with myself <em>or</em> her before attempting to take him.\u201d The stoat presses his paws together. \u201cI\u2019d hate to think what might happen if word were to get out that two Commission representatives were going to kidnap <em>another</em> child.\u201d The Commission had taken a heavy strike from the public and Japanese Government when word got out about what had been done to the current number three hero, <em>kidnapped </em>at such a young age, tortured, brutally trained, treated less then human. \u00a0Nedzu had a sort of kinship with the winged hero, he too know what brutal abuse felt like, it was one of few things they had in common. \u201cAnd, nevertheless, the child of the hero who was the cause of such heavy restrictions imposed by the Japanese Government, they gave one chance at redemption before they did some restaffing and delivered persecution for such heinous treatment, I do wonder how they would feel about you attempting to kidnap the child of their favored hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dark haired an in a black suit glares down at the principle. \u201cAre you threatening the Commission?\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves a paw dismissively. \u201cHeaven\u2019s no, I\u2019m merely inquiring, no one would have to be none the wiser of this current predicament we find ourselves in, if you leave my campus and refrain from attempting to have contact with young Takami again.\u201d He crosses his paws again. \u201cAfter all, you both wouldn\u2019t want to be the reason the Commission is rebuilt, your President loses her job and faces criminal charges, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The two Commission representatives exchange looks and nod firmly, turning to make their leave, noticeably, <em>empty handed</em>, their dress shoes crunch over the snow accumulating under foot as the disappear around the corner.</p>\n<p>Nedzu turns to the owlet crying into Hound Dog\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYoung Takami, it is alright, do you think you could make it stop snowing, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to slip on the snow and hurt themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>The small winged boy curls around the larger hero tightly, but the snow does stop falling, and the stoat nods, thought intrigued by the boys quirk and what exactly it entailed, he knew now was not the right time to inquire about it, the priority in this situation was getting the frightened child with an otherwise unknown quirk back to his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, Ryo, it is imperative we return him to Hawks before any more unintended quirk usage occurs.\u201d He nods, turning in time with the stoat, and together they make their way down the snowy hall, snow crunching underfoot, a cleaning bot would be sent to clean up the mess.</p>\n<p>They find them on the training field, overseeing the students battling each other, and both heroes turn at the sound of the child\u2019s cries.</p>\n<p>All Might and Hawks frown for very different reasons.</p>\n<p>The winged hero reaches out for his young son. \u201cBaby bird, what\u2019s wrong, you were napping in the staff lounge, I was coming back after class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku curls around the hero, sobbing into his shoulder, curling his wings around himself as best as he could. Hawks rubs his back soothingly and looks up at the two who\u2019d brought his extremely distraught son to him sharply. \u201cWhat happened, he was down for his nap, he should still <em>be</em> napping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nedzu presses his paws together. \u201cSomeone,\u201d his gaze briefly flickers to All Might before returning to the other. \u201cCalled in representatives from the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <em>what!\u201d</em> He bounces the five year old lightly in an attempt to calm him down, and it works, slowly but surely. \u201c<em>Who!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>All Might clears his throat and they turn to him. \u201cI did. I thought they should be made aware of the child\u2019s predicament.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawks glowers at him over the silent child in his arms. \u201cYou <em>what</em>! What <em>predicament</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe should not be here.\u201d The other blonde nods in assurance. \u201cIt is unsafe. He should be looked after elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you would have taken my son from me without my knowledge?\u201d He snarls lowly. \u201cYou would have been complacent in him being kidnapped?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have kept him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey kept <em>me</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d they all turn at the young voice that calls out, the blonde teen with the explosion quirk, and he\u2019s glaring at the number one hero. \u201cYou almost let the bird boy be kidnapped?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sniffles and turns around to see, rubbing at his nose with the back of his right hand, his other curled tightly in the collar of papa bird\u2019s coat. \u201cK\u2014Kacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugo Katsuki nods. \u201cHey, bird boy, it\u2019s good to see you again, safe and sound.\u201d</p>\n<p>The winged child giggles softly. \u201cMissed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you too.\u201d The normally gruff and brash teen\u2019s tone is surprisingly gentle and soft. \u201cYou should come over and see mom and dad, they\u2019d be really happy to see you, they\u2019ve been worried about you all this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods and looks up at the hero holding him. \u201cCan we go see Auntie \u2018Suki and Uncle \u2018Saru, papa?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawks smiles down at him and nods, nuzzling their cheeks together. \u201cOf course, we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blonde teen nods. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my mom and dad and get back to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero turns and nods at the teen. \u201cOf course, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d He glares at All Might before he turns to return to the class.</p>\n<p>\u201cHawks, a word?\u201d The winged man turns back to the principle, perched on Hound Dog\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYoung Izuku\u2019s quirk may be more then a simple avian mutation. He made it snow in the hallway and gave the two representatives frostbite from mere touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hawks turns to smile at the small child, tickling his belly lightly, making him giggle brightly, a far cry from his sobbing minutes ago. \u201cIs my little owlet a powerful little thing?\u201d Izuku squeals softly when he turns to try and get away and fingers tickle his side instead. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to look into this, aren\u2019t we, little snow bird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPapa! Papa!\u201d The winged child cries between fits of bright bubbly laughter. \u201cStop! Tickles! Stop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d he brushes their noses together and smiles when the little trouble maker licks his nose. \u201cBut you\u2019re gonna get it later for licking my nose, you little brat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku knows he\u2019s going to be in big trouble, when papa tells him to go hide when the villains attack the USJ, and he flies over their heads to the blue haired man taunting Uncle Shouta, and lands just beside him, making the man jump in surprise, clearly not expecting a five year old winged child to just appear.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d He waves up at the man. \u201cI\u2019m Izuku! I\u2019m five! What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Red eyes watch him for a long time, and he smiles, waving again, before the man slowly smiles, and squats to be on his level. \u201cHello, little bird, I\u2019m Tomura, I\u2019m twenty.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little child bounces slightly and points at his hair. \u201cI like your hair! Blue is my favorite color!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Izuku,\u201d Tomura ruffles his curls with a gloved hand. \u201cI like your hair too, my favorite color\u2019s green.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans forward against the man\u2019s knees. \u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d The man shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m just doing as I was told to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen,\u201d Izuku tilts his head and his wings flutter curiously. \u201cWhy are you hurtin\u2019 everyone if you\u2019re not mad? You were told to hurt people? Why? Do you wanna hurt people? Are you gonna hurt me too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Tomura stutters, for the first time in his life, he\u2019s stumped, and by a small winged five year old boy no less. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man tilts his head slightly. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t want to hurt kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>The greenette tilts his head to the other side. \u201cBut aren\u2019t the others just kids too, I mean, they\u2019re big kids, but aren\u2019t big kids still kids too? Why are you doing something you don\u2019t want to do? That doesn\u2019t sound right. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to do something you don\u2019t want to do. People who make you do things you don\u2019t want to do are meanies and I like you and I don\u2019t think you should listen to meanies because meanies hurt you and I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Tomura did <em>not</em> plan for this, for a small winged child to tell him, one, that he liked him, two, that he shouldn\u2019t have to do something he didn\u2019t want to do, and three, if he didn\u2019t want to hurt kids then he shouldn\u2019t be hurting the hero brats because they\u2019re still kids, albeit, in the little birds words, big kids. He did not plan for this turn of events. \u201cI never thought of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles, and by god, it\u2019s the most adorable thing he\u2019s ever heard in his entire lifetime, and he does what he usually does to people he really likes, leans up on the man\u2019s knees, and licks his nose.</p>\n<p>His new friend laughs softly, and he shrieks when he\u2019s scooped up into the blue haired man\u2019s arms, as he rises. \u201cYou\u2019re right, little bird, I shouldn\u2019t hurt kids if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tickling the little bird\u2019s belly lightly, just to make him giggle again, because his giggles are adorable and he needs them in his life now that he\u2019s heard them, when Kurogiri warps in behind them. \u201cShigaraki, what is your plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSend the others back, Kurogiri.\u201d Tomura smiles down at the giggling child. \u201cI\u2019m not hurting kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure, Shigaraki?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blue haired man nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure, take the Nomu too, I don\u2019t want it around the little bird, you can return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the warper does as he\u2019s told and warps their entourage away with the Nomu. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles and finally catches his hand before he can tickle his belly again. \u201cI\u2019m staying with the little bird.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>The little owlet sniffles softly as he walks out of papa\u2019s room, rubbing his bottom lightly, and rubs at his nose with the back of his hand, then his eyes with his fists, and returns to rubbing his bottom.</p>\n<p>He supposes it was deserved, he <em>did</em> ignore what papa told him to do, he knew he\u2019d be in big trouble when they got home, but he hadn\u2019t thought of <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>Izuku hops down into their nest and plops himself down on the lap of the man resting inside, he supposes it\u2019s worth it, he got a new big brother out of it, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby bird, you better not be pouting when I join you guys in the nest.\u201d He giggles at papa\u2019s warning and ducks into Tomura\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
