  "notes": "<p>Now a <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/16703521/chapters/39175498\" rel=\"nofollow\">PodFic</a> by c_doves! Please go give it a listen, it's amazing!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I would like to retroactively apologize for all of my just crap knowledge about science. Ignorance, I think is what it's called. I'm sorry. I'd also like to apologize for any subsequent science stupidities. I've put my love into the wrong characters, them science nerds, because I know nothing.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I'm just totally wowed by the positive response this story has gotten! Thank you all so much! It makes me so giddy seeing all of the wonderful comments, and the kudos... all the kudos. </p>\n<p>I've got most of the story outlined, so no worries that this beaut won't get finished. And I've even got fever dreams of a sequel <em>and</em> a prequel. Because I <em>need</em> more things on my plate. Of course I do.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to publish chapters at least bi-weekly, though that might slow down a little in July, as I'm traveling overseas and probably won't have too much time to write things. </p>\n<p>Till then, I'll hope to steadily be updating. Thanks again for the strong support!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>This is coming out quicker and quicker, I think. I'm hoping to get it all out before I go abroad and will be pretty much incommunicado for a whole month. On the downside, I've really really got stuck on a sequel for this (which is annoying since I haven't even got the original out in its entirety yet) so that probably won't come out till august???? Or later?<br>Eeeeither way, I hope you enjoy this installment (do the kids still use that phrasing? Why do I have no idea what's happening in popular thingies) *cough cough* I've gotten out of control.<br>Here you go!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope Thor wasn't too ooc? I'm so bad at writing him, I don't know why my brain insists on doing so, I really don't!<br>And Hair! Huzzah!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>You guys are Awesome! Thanks for all the wonderful responses, reading the comments always makes me squeal in really awful ways that just scare my dogs to death.<br>I'm trying to churn this out faster, because I'm leaving in a week and I don't want anything to slow this story down, but since I <em>am</em> leaving in a week, I'm actually really busy doing pre-leaving in a week things? Like packing? And calling my bank to tell them not to shut down my account if I use my cards overseas (which reminds me that I should actually do that immediately).<br>Cheers!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>You guys are literally the most sweetest of all people ever. Your comments give me life, and your kudos... well the swell my already too-big head, so... yeah. Thanks though, you're all awesome!</p>\n<p>I have recently had no time to do anything fun. I wrote this chapter as quick as I possibly could, because I had to read Dracula, which was 160k words of period-acceptable sexism and really cliched (can it be cliched if it was the originator of the cliche?) vampire plot points. I should also point out that despite these things it was a fun book. I recommend, like 7/10. I enjoyed it, though it <em>was</em> for school, and so, while necessary, completely soul-destroying, as I read the whole thing in like, 2 days. </p>\n<p>I know, I know, I could have done it in 1, but then I would have collapsed from exhaustion... and one of those days was Fathers Day so I had to... you know... interact with my father...</p>\n<p>Shhhh! I'm an adult, I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks again, and I hope this Chapter was up to par!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>Oh My God! I am so, so, so sorry about the wait on this. I honestly had this chapter (short as it is, and I'd like to apologize for that too) written days ago. But then I was doing last-minute packing, and then I was on a plane for hours and then I was in an airport, and then I was on another plane for even longer, and then I got here and I am so low on sleep that I have no idea what to do. </p>\n<p>So....here's this thing. </p>\n<p>And it's shorter than I'd like as well, :( but here this is. Because Wifi here is spotty at best, and I'm not only doing schooling but also in the most Amazing London (my first time overseas, I'm excited beyond measure) I might not have time to update as much as I'd like, let alone write as much as I like. Things might slooooow doooown, but I'm going to try to get the next chapter up fast to make up for this mini one.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for all of your awesome kudos and comments,</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n<p>Hello again, I hope the wait hasn't prematurely killed any of you off. I've somehow got all of this written besides visiting seemingly everywhere in this beautiful city, and a few places outside of it, and all with doing massive amounts of homework as well (yay school!). Do you know, I popped by both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and I didn't meet the Queen either time? I think it's ridiculous. And I've seen the crown jewels and totally did not steal them, I don't even know what you are talking about right now, you are a crazy person, what? And Big Ben, and Parliament, and both the London Bridge and the London Tower Bridge and the Queen's Gallery, and Kew Gardens, and my feet have asked me politely if I would please just leave them alone for the rest of my life. </p>\n<p>I actually finished writing this chapter just now in a bit of a funk, because despite all of the cool things I've been seeing, homework is still a thing, and yet others in my class disagree, and we just got a mass email from our teacher pretty much saying \"You suck, class is cancelled until you can get your shit together. I am seriously disappointed in all of you. Etc. Etc.\" So I felt super bad, and as a result the ending of the chapter is... something?</p>\n<p>Either way, enough about me. I know who you're really here for. </p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>It has been a long time, my friends. I'm talking years, here, and I hope this is suffice for such a long wait. I think I'm getting close to the end here, and so there'll only be few more chapters. And then an angst-ridden wait for me to figure out how to begin a sequel.<br>Cheers!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Ahhh, so I think that after this there's only going to be one more chapter. I've got it kind of mapped out, and as much as I'd like to prolong your suffering--I mean this story, I think that is going to be it. Until the sequel...</p>\n<p>Anyway, till then, cheers!</p>\n<p>So guys, this is it for this one. It took a bit longer than usual because plane rides from England to US are long and I died inside.</p>\n<p>And for you guys expecting Logon to show up...I am so sorry. You're going to be so disappointed D:</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>How'd you like it? Not too bad, I hope.<br>Well no worries, I've got a sequel in the works, and have even got it all kind of planned out on the back of an Olive Garden napkin, so there's that...<br>It's a coming, that's all that's important, right?<br>Don't hurt me.</p>\n<p>Edit:<br>It's out!<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/4721882/chapters/10789061\" rel=\"nofollow\">Petey and Wade are obviously an item, so why is Spiderman trying to be a homewrecker?</a></p>",
  "text": "<p>It was all very domestic, Peter thought, as he watched his lover (ex-enemy/spandex guy/crazy mercenary with a soft spot for the tex-mex side of Mexican food) rifle through their mail. It was a good day. Spiderman and Deadpool had caught some really stupid bank robbers the night before (tried to rob an ATM for God sake. Who does that? Not to mention that they were armed with water pistols and wore pantyhose for masks. The flesh colored ones. You could totally see their faces) and it had been easy and fun to team up with his boyfriend. The banter was a constant comfort, and all together it was just warm and light to hear Wade screaming about halibut as Peter webbed a guy\u2019s face to a wall. It was the best kind of date.</p>\n<p>And then they made out on the roof of their apartment, their masks riding up to just above their noses, and it was greedy and sloppy and Peter could feel his blood running hot beneath his skin, and his last really coherent thought went into swinging them both down into their bedroom through an open window before they ended up having completely steamy, spandexy sex as their alter egos on the roof of the apartment of their \u2018normal\u2019 egos. Again. But it was all good because Peter then lost any semblance of coherency and had completely steamy, spandexy sex in the comfort of their own bedroom (if not their own bed) and Wade took off his mask all the way which had Peter groaning and coming way sooner than he\u2019d meant to. </p>\n<p>And then round two.</p>\n<p>And three.</p>\n<p>Four five and six, and then again lazily when they woke up the next morning.</p>\n<p>And the best bit was that it was a Saturday, which meant that they could just laze around the house the rest of the day, having languid sex, playing video games, and eating all of the tacos that Wade could order. Peter didn't even have any nagging worries about missing any homework because in some weird twist of fate, all of his professors had decided to go homework-free since it was the weekend before finals week. </p>\n<p>He would regret it later, he knew. He could be studying. Majoring in bio-mechanical engineering was all good, but memorizing everything was hard, okay? And finals were going to be a bitch. But he didn't care, because right now he was too busy admiring Wade as he flipped through the mail (and insulted each one individually, sometimes even going so far as to curse their family in the name of jelly or something equally ridiculous). Because it was domestic and 50s-sitcomish, and also Wade was completely naked except for a pair of thigh-high stockings with little bows on the back of each leg and a garland of laurel leaves he was wearing around his head like he was some Caesar turned prostitute.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck do we gotta pay electricity each month?\u201d Wade complained, gesticulating wildly with a ripped-open envelope in one hand. \u201cWe save this damn city, we should get light for free. And why do we need light anyway? Moles can do the whole life thing blind, why can't we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked and had to force himself to not smile indulgently at his boyfriend. \u201cWell, for one, no one knows we save the city, especially since you usually wreck it more than you protect it,\u201d Wade gave a little pout that pulled his scars into some jumbled, knotted mess. Peter had the sudden urge to kiss each one of them smooth again and then keep going until they were pulled into something equally messy but more delicious and moan-inducing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd two, no one else gets exempt from paying bills just because they do their jobs. Even the ones who work for the government. Besides, you have a shit ton of money from all those contracts from before you stopped killing innocents for cash. I like to call it your reformation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>For love!</em>\u201d Wade drew the words out in a soft southern-belle sort of falsetto and swooned against the kitchen counter. Then he threw the shredded envelope at Peter\u2019s head. \u201cWhy do they call them bills anyway? Did they used to be called Williams and people just thought the name was too long?\u201d He flipped to the next envelope \u201cWilliam!\u201d which he also threw at Peter. \u201cAnd why do we have to pay for them every month? What made months so important? Why couldn't it have been every day or every week? Every year? Every hour? I don't mean that I'm going to make you go to that paying place every hour on the hour, sweetie Petey, I just want to know \u2013 William!\u201d He threw this one at Peter too, \u201cwhy months? Oh hello\u2014what\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade held up plain white envelope and then flipped it over so Peter could see the giant \u201cSTARK INDUSTRIES\u201d printed on it in bold black letters.</p>\n<p>Peter sat up straighter in his chair, a frown marring his face. \u201cIs it for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shook his head and Peter\u2019s eyebrows shot up, but before he could confirm that it was then for himself, Wade, for some reason, felt the need to elaborate and started talking again (which was no surprise actually, because he never really shut up). </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, because they don't know I live here. It isn't exactly mercenary chic, or even ex-mercenary chic to give out my home address to people who have dirt on me, and bigger guns then me (sadly), and who don't know I'm living with my very hot, very young, very innocent and smart and sexy and oh my god Peter do you wanna do that thing we saw in the back of Kama Sutra last week? I know we've been saving it for a special occasion but I really can't wait and you're super flexible so I think we could probably handle it? You're even, like, more flexible than the chick in the drawing, so I bet we could get your leg all the way up there. Better angle.\u201d He blinked a few times, and Peter took the time to smile at his boyfriend (and internally grimace at himself because he shouldn't find rambling tangents to be that adorable) before clearing his throat and effectively putting Wade back on the right track. \u201cRight, so no, the Avengers don't have my home address. I wouldn't give it to them even if they asked, and especially not Stark, but they wouldn't send me letters anyway, Petey-Pie because this is the 21st century and no one uses snail mail. There's this new technology? Telephones, you just hold them to your ear\u2014\u201d Peter threw a pillow at Wade\u2019s face, which he dodged, \u201cor email, not that anyone uses that anymore either\u2026texting? You could even Facebook message me, if you find out which Da Reelz Deadpool FB account is mine.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEither way, it's for you.\u201d And he held the envelope out for Peter to take.</p>\n<p>Peter made a grabby motion with his hand and Wade sighed in a put-upon manner (as if Peter was the one who was being weird and troublesome) and threw the letter at Peter\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Babe,\u201d Peter said as he caught the letter between two dexterous fingers before it had even thought about leaving a paper cut on his face. Wade stuck his tongue out at Peter in a perfect imitation of a five year old.</p>\n<p>Peter ripped open the envelope, unfolded the letter, swatted at Wade who was trying to sit in Peter\u2019s lap and who was thus effectively blocking the letter from Peter\u2019s line of sight, and then read the troublesome thing (not Wade, the letter).</p>\n<p>Then he read it again because it just didn\u2019t seem likely that he wasn\u2019t hallucinating (he wasn\u2019t on any kind of drugs, he\u2019d had the perfect amount of sleep and he wasn\u2019t drunk), but it seemed less likely that what he was reading was real.</p>\n<p>Peter cleared his throat and flapped the letter, embossed and shiny and everything that screamed I-make-more-money-in-a-day-than-you-do-in-a-year, at his boyfriend.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, hmm,\u201d Peter cleared his throat, \u201cWade, darling, could you read this please? I could swear it was a letter from the great Tony Stark himself congratulating me for being accepted into his internship program, but that can\u2019t be right.\u201d Peter blinked a few times.</p>\n<p>Wade slid across the room in his stocking feet and grabbed the letter out of Peter\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, honey-boo-boo. You got in. Congrats!\u201d Wade looked at Peter\u2019s rapidly paling face and amended his statement, \u201cNot-congrats?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter breathed out harshly through his nose, and Wade sat down next to him on the couch. Peter\u2019s eyes were drawn almost at once to first the dangly bits between Wade\u2019s legs that were casually hanging out on their sofa, and then to Wade\u2019s eyes, which looked muddled and confused. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really mean to apply.\u201d Wade raised his eyebrows and the laurels tottered over his ears in an endearing way, \u201cI mean, I did, but I never thought I\u2019d get in!\u201d Wade did not look impressed, but he obviously knew enough about Peter by now to know to be silent and let the younger man explain himself fully before telling Peter he was a self-degrading dumbass. \u201cAunt May told me I should do it, and I did, just to make her happy! I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get in. It\u2019s a great program, super prestigious. I thought, what\u2019s the harm in trying, it isn\u2019t going to happen. Because if it did happen, if I did get in,\u201d here his words were coming quicker, a note that real panic was setting in, \u201cthen I\u2019d be working side by side with Bruce Banner and Tony Stark who are both amazing creatures of intellect and light, but also super super super smart Avengers who will definitely find out my secret identity and then I\u2019ll get them all killed or they\u2019ll throw me in jail for being an arachnid vigilante fighting guy and I just can\u2019t take that. Plus, I\u2019ll be in the same building as the rest of the Avengers, and if by some weird lucky-fate-chance-thing the two smartest scientists in the continental US don\u2019t figure out who I really am, there are lots of others who would be more than willing to de-mask me. And spies! SHIELD spies everywhere!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe, baby boy,\u201d Wade intoned, his lips pulled wide in his own special version of the indulgent-boyfriend smile. \u201cHere\u2019s what you are going to do. You are going to take the internship because if you don\u2019t you will literally regret if for the rest of your life, which means that you\u2019ll be thinking about it a lot, and I can\u2019t have that because you need to be thinking about <em>me</em> a lot for the rest of your life. I\u2019m not going to compete with regret; it has the kind of nag power that I can only dream about. And after you start working there, you\u2019re gonna see how ridiculous you are because no one expects little Petey-piper to be sex-in-spandex\u2014rhyming!\u2014spidey-dude because he\u2019s way more witty than you are, my man!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am just as witty!\u201d Peter snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gaped at his boyfriend. \u201cI am literally the same person.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gave him the same smile you would give a child who insisted he were a duck, the patronizing \u2018<em>yes, of course you are</em>,\u2019 chuckled and blew off Peter\u2019s statement. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re gonna be super smarter, and you\u2019ll wow Hulk and Ironman with your big, gorgeous, pulsating brain, and they\u2019ll love you. And then in a decade or so, once everyone is all buddy-buddy, then you can tell them you\u2019re Spiderman and they\u2019ll say \u2018Oh Em Gee! That\u2019s so great because you\u2019re so great and now you can be on the team! Hashtag May I have your children?\u2019 and then I\u2019ll have to kill them all because you are <em>mine</em> and no one but me can have your children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade, we are both men. Neither of us are bearing any children.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade scoffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Then he looked off into a middle distance for a second before saying, \u201cK\u2019duh! Science is super advanced! No\u2014ugh, I hate arguing with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter let Wade finish whatever debate he was having with his boxes but couldn\u2019t stop himself from wringing his hands in nervous anticipation. </p>\n<p>Could Wade be right? He <em>was</em> always super careful about keeping his mouth shut about the super hero thing, and he made sure to appear as not-threatening and as human as possible at all times. He never even jumped on the ceiling when Wade flew at him with both katanas drawn anymore (though that might actually be <em>more</em> of a problem considering that swords actually <em>were</em> dangerous and he most definitely didn\u2019t want to die). And maybe the scientists would be too busy being part-time scientists, part-time super heroes to notice that Peter was also part-time scientist (college-student, good boyfriend, etc), part-time super hero.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus!\u201d Wade squealed, interrupting Peter\u2019s internal debate, \u201cI\u2019ll be working with the Avengers pretty often now that SHIELD\u2019s psych people have given me the green light and I\u2019ve proved that I probably won\u2019t be murdering anyone in the near future, so we can have <em>lunch dates</em>!\u201d He squealed and jumped to his feet, doing a little happy-dance that somehow incorporated the waltz, the robot, and some Irish jig Peter had never seen before.</p>\n<p>The younger man\u2019s resolve melted. It was a paid internship, which was good, he\u2019d be meeting the foremost smartest scientists to ever be alive during Peter\u2019s lifetime, which was pretty awesome, and he\u2019d get to eat lunch with Wade every day, which he would adore. No downside. He let a huff of laughter pass through his lips and he nodded. He would accept the internship.</p>\n<p>He walked into the lobby of Stark Industries his first day on the job, his heart beating about a million miles a minute because he was about to meet Tony Stark, richest/smartest super hero ever, and would be lying to him for the foreseeable future. And what if he wasn\u2019t what Stark wanted anyway? What if it was all a mistake and Stark would start talking about something so smart that even Peter couldn\u2019t figure out what he was saying and Stark would see that Peter wasn\u2019t right for the job and would fire him on the spot?</p>\n<p>Then he forced himself to breathe because Stark would know that Peter was only a college student and wouldn\u2019t think he would know stuff above his pay-grade. Or, just grade, like, school-level. He smart, but not, graduate-student-about-to-get-a-doctorate-with-three-dissertations-under-my-belt smart.</p>\n<p>Peter looked around him. People in suits were bustling by, quiet conversations muttered too low to be easily heard (unless super hearing was coming into play, in which case Peter would have no qualms telling you that that blond man in the green and black tie was planning on dumping his girlfriend that evening, and that the two women huddled close together were hiding their relationship from their bosses). He checked his watch and saw that he was still fourteen minutes early. The front desk was manned by a brunette with a scarlet blazer, and there was no one in front of her, but Peter still couldn\u2019t work up the courage to ask her what to do. </p>\n<p>Plus he was still early which made Peter\u2019s mind spiral off on a tangent about punctuality. Aunt May had always said that punctuality was a sign of a good worker, and that if he wanted to impress his teachers (or his bosses, including but not limited to the hard-ass J. Jonah Jameson who he used to sell photos of Spiderman to back when he was photographer extraordinaire, which he still sometimes moonlighted as when he needed the extra cash extra quick). But, punctuality, did that cover also being early. Being on time was good, late was bad, on that scale, the earlier you arrived, the better off you were, which might be nice, but what if they were busy? They being whoever he was meeting. Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, x number of other interns who were probably all much smarter than Peter and who would show the two important ones just how unimportant <em>Peter</em> was.</p>\n<p>The clicking of heels on tile getting closer to him with every step drew Peter out of his head and he looked up in time to see a smiling red head stretching out her hand to meet his. Her hand was cool and smooth, but her grip was firm, and the red lacquer on her pointed nails did nothing to sooth his harried mind. What her handshake failed to do, her voice and smile made up for in spades, and when she talked, Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile in return.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Parker?\u201d she asked, and her smile was so warm and welcoming that Peter could feel his nerves settle. He smiled and nodded, letting her know that yes, she had found the right scared-out-of-his-wits intern. \u201cWelcome. My name is Virginia Potts, and I am the CEO of Stark Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s smile vanished, and he could feel the blood draining from his face. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts gave a delighted little smile and led him over to the elevator, whose doors opened immediately. \u201cI know. I\u2019m not sure any other CEO would take time to show the new interns around, but I was Mr. Stark\u2019s PA for so long, and it is nice to meet the fresh new faces again. Paperwork is too much sometimes, and it isn\u2019t like Tony\u2014Mr. Stark is going to remember to fetch you himself.\u201d Then, addressing the elevator as a whole, she said, \u201cFloor twenty six please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s brow scrunched together because, was this woman crazy? Or did all CEOs talk to elevators? Peter was just about to lean over and press the button himself, when dulcet British voice reverberated through the small metal room. \u201cOf course, Madam.\u201d The elevator did not even give a jolt as it started to ascend.</p>\n<p>Peter gave a shaky laugh. \u201cUmm,\u201d he gulped, \u201cwhat?\u201d Peter could have smacked himself for sounding so lost when he could easily have just pulled off the nonchalant \u201coh, yeah, this is a talking elevator. Didn\u2019t think they were out in the market already. I thought they weren\u2019t even going to start production until next January,\u201d but then Mrs. Potts turned to him with a slightly amused, slightly guilty look.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that, I forget sometimes that others haven\u2019t met Jarvis. Jarvis is Tony\u2019s AI, he manages all of the mechanics of SI. Jarvis, this is Peter Parker. Peter, this is Jarvis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Parker,\u201d the voice intoned, and Peter could catch a tiny hint of what sounded like actual, natural kindness in the AI\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>Well then, easy, just another person to meet. \u201cThe pleasure is all mine, Mr. Jarvis. I would shake your hand, but, and I hope I\u2019m not being rude, I don\u2019t know if you have one or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Potts stifled a chuckle.</p>\n<p>Jarvis\u2019s voice definitely held amusement when he spoke. \u201cI do not. But do not worry, the possible forthcoming conversation where both of us politely try to avoid the subjects of prosthetics may be postponed, as you have just arrived at your destination.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he stopped talking, so too did the elevator come to a stop and the doors slid open. Mrs. Potts led them out without hesitation, but Peter said a quick, \u201cGoodbye Mr. Jarvis,\u201d before following the CEO down a short corridor, a sharp left turn through a glass door. </p>\n<p>And then Peter\u2019s heart stopped because\u2014Holy mother of Hell!\u2014this was a lab that wet dreams were made of. Holographic floating computer screens in blue and black, transmission electron microscopes, a small robot who was sweeping with a hand broom at a completely clean square of floor, screwdrivers, a basket of wiring boards, an actual sledgehammer (actually, maybe this lab was just full of really weird stuff) and\u2014oh shit! Tony Stark himself, tinkering with a motherboard with a screwdriver in one hand and another in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Peter gaped at him, couldn\u2019t stop really, and Stark was just sitting there fiddling with tech so tech it was too tech for Peter to fully grasp, but it looked sort of like the base for an Artificial Intelligence upgr\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cTony!\u201d Ms. Potts snapped and Stark\u2019s head jumped up to glance first at Ms. Potts and then stare a little longer at Peter. Finally he stood, dropping both screwdrivers on the metal table, and swaggered over to where Peter was standing, a meeting-the-press smile on his face and his hand outstretched in greeting.</p>\n<p>Peter met Stark\u2019s hand with his own and gripped it, not too loose nor too firm. \u201cMr. Stark, I\u2019m Peter Parker. I, uh, was accepted for your internship program?\u201d Unfortunately, despite Peter\u2019s strong handshake (represents confidence, Wade said) Peter\u2019s voice still wavered, and his statement ended up sounding more like a question.</p>\n<p>Stark gave a kind, if formal smile and said, \u201cPleased to meet you, Peter. And by all means, geek out. I know a fanboy when I see one. I won\u2019t judge.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows and, honestly Peter was meeting Tony Stark, so\u2026 Stark was right. Peter was totally fanboying his little heart out at meeting, hello, the foremost mechanical engineer/scientist in, like, the world.</p>\n<p>Peter gave an excited little squeak, and jumped right in. \u201cOh my God, Mr. Stark. It is such an honor to meet the man who got into MIT at 15 and in four years graduated with two masters and who pretty much cleared the field with your work in quantum physics. I honestly cannot even believe that someone so advanced in the fields of electrical and mechanical engineering would accept me into their program. It is such an honor to work with such an esteemed individual and now I am blabbering, but it is just so good to be standing into the same <em>room</em> as someone who was actually able to make clean energy for the future more than a mere fantasy with the invention and use of the Arc reactor and who actually has plans for using it in the works. Do you even know? And you created your own AI who has become practically sentient, not to mention able to think and process data faster than a human\u2019s mind. I just met him in the elevator and he was super cool and very life-like, so like, kudos!\u201d Peter stopped himself with a quick bite to his lip, and in a more sedate tone said, \u201cI mean, thanks for this opportunity and everything, but right now I can kind of only focus on the fact that I\u2019m in the same room with the guy who built a working life-support and suit in a cave, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark gave a delighted little laugh and looked at Ms. Potts where she still stood behind Peter. \u201cI like this one. I\u2019m keeping him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell he <em>is</em> your intern, Tony.\u201d She sounded exasperated, but fond, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but think that Ms. Potts was perhaps the Peter to Stark\u2019s Wade. </p>\n<p>Tony gave him a mischievous smirk and then dragged him away to show him around the lab, which was glorious in its beauty and new and clean unlike any lab he could find on campus, and then introduced him to Dr. Banner which had Peter fanboying all over again. Dr. Banner could really blush, too, which Peter learned when he continued to gush over all of his accomplishments and dissertations. Of course, once Dr. Banner (\u201cCall me Bruce\u201d) had started blushing, Peter just had to keep going. It was like a challenge, wasn\u2019t it? To see how much redder he could make the good doctor? But soon everything calmed, and Stark left Peter to do his own work and Peter could finally settle down into whatever tasks Stark had left him. Peter smiled at the little to-do list written in green ink, and relaxed into his seat, ready to work.</p>\n<p>It was fun work, fiddling with little mechanized bots and trying to find the miniscule issues in miles of coding, and that explained why he almost forgot to take his lunch break, but Dr. Banner was kind enough to come over and remind him to go eat. Peter checked his watch and it told him he was already three minutes late to his date with Wade. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit!\u201d Peter exclaimed and hoped off his stool so quickly that he was afraid he\u2019d revealed his super powers to call-me-Bruce, but Dr. Banner only laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave somewhere to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s lips curled into a goofy smile (he could feel it being silly and couldn\u2019t stop himself) and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got a lunch date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce chuckled. \u201cWell, go on then. Don\u2019t let an old man like me keep you waiting. Go have lunch and I\u2019ll see you in an hour?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a silly little salute and said, \u201csure thing\u201d and scampered off to go have his first ever eating-at-work lunch with his boyfriend. Ok, yes he was excited. Shut up. </p>\n<p>Finding the cafeteria (it was an office building, they definitely had a cafeteria) was not hard, but it was sort of far away, and by the time Peter arrived he was already ten minutes late. Which, looking around the cafeteria and not seeing Wade, Peter realized meant that he was still early. Wade wasn\u2019t good at times. Being late wasn\u2019t just something wade did, it was something he excelled at. When they had first started dating, and Wade was still in his this-is-a-hallucination-or-I\u2019m-dreaming-or-Peter-is-drugged-and-I\u2019m-too-selfish-to-snap-him-out-of-it-because-I-can\u2019t-stand-not-being-around-him phase he had been punctual to everything. Every date, or meeting, even between Spiderman and Deadpool. But the more comfortable he became with the idea that Peter was not going anywhere (except for those few times when they\u2019d had fights so bad that Peter had left to spend the night at Aunt May\u2019s and Wade had mistakenly taken that for breaking up and he\u2019d gone and done something stupid like get himself killed, or blow up a building, or write Peter a sonnet, etc. etc. etc.) the more often he was late. Not because he meant to be late, but he just wasn\u2019t good at keeping appointments. He always got side-tracked. </p>\n<p>So Peter stood in line and got double orders of chicken curry, double orders of potato wedges, a cup of fruit for him and another order of potato wedges for Wade, and then another order of potato wedges for Wade. What? They didn\u2019t have anything remotely Mexican or hotdogs, almost-french fries were the next best option. And yes, the stringy dude running the cash register did look at him weird, but who cared what he thought? Peter was on a date!</p>\n<p>He snagged a booth at the back of the cafeteria and opened his fruit cup. Wade probably wouldn\u2019t be much longer, but if he was super late Peter still only had an hour lunch so his food had to get eaten at some point. He popped a grape in his mouth and kept an eye on the door. Of course, because he was specifically waiting for Wade, it was not Wade who next walked through the door. It was Black Widow.</p>\n<p>Now, why the Black Widow would deign to eat cafeteria food when she had her own kitchen upstairs (They all lived in their own suites upstairs, Wade had told him one afternoon, and they had even given Wade his own place, a smaller, guest-roomier feeling place, but a place all the same. Wade had told them he had a place, but they hadn\u2019t believed him, thought he was just trying save face) peter didn\u2019t know. The room was relatively empty, and no one even glanced up when the fierce looking woman entered, but Peter couldn\u2019t help but think that that was more because the Avengers were weird and everyone had gotten used to it and not because the assassin was being sneaky.</p>\n<p>She looked around her, taking in everything, every chair out of place, every spat of conversation, and very briefly her eyes landed on Peter, he saw her glance fleetingly at the tray of food in front of him, the slice of pineapple half-way to his mouth, before dismissing him. She swung around, her short red hair fanning out behind her, and raised her wrist to her lips. Some sort of communication link in her sleeve cuff? She spoke into it, and it was quiet, too quiet for a normal person to hear, but Peter was Spiderman, could hear more than the average human. She said, \u201cHe\u2019s not here. I\u2019m going to finish sweeping the rest of the floor and then I\u2019ll head up to the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glanced away.</p>\n<p>It must be some Avengers business then. Wasn\u2019t his place to eavesdrop.</p>\n<p>Peter was halfway through Wade\u2019s second order of potato wedges when the man himself walked through the door. Well, walked was too kind a word. He flounced in, dressed to the nines in his full Deadpool regalia. Katanas strapped to his back, guns strapped to his thighs, and a belt loaded with probably explosives around his waist. Red and black really did look good on him.</p>\n<p>Wade spotted Peter and skipped over to his table, grabbed the plate of chicken curry that Peter had set before himself, and crouched on the back of the seat opposite Peter. He curled his legs up under him and for a split second Peter worried that Wade would fall flat on his face, sitting criss-crossed on the top of a seatback. But this was Wade Wilson, doing the impossible was practically his M.O. </p>\n<p>\u201cHello, you sexy thang!\u201d Wade squealed and lifted the bottom of his mask just far enough to be able to feed himself, and continued, all the while stuffing food into his mouth. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gorgeous young man like you doing in a place like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter huffed playfully and gave Wade a fake pout. \u201cWaiting for my boyfriend, actually. What are\u2014\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGot him,\u201d said a voice from above and a blond man wearing a leather jacket dropped from the ceiling onto their table.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter exclaimed, shooting backwards. He had just enough sense of mind to keep himself from clinging to the walls or webbing the man in the face, but he couldn\u2019t keep the surprise from his voice. He sneaked a glance upwards and saw that the man had dropped from a vent above their table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelloooooo Clinty-boo,\u201d Wade sing-songed and stuffed another handful (yes handful, he was using his hands, not silverware) of curry into his face.</p>\n<p>The man, Clint (must be Hawkeye) gave Wade an exasperated look and said, \u201cDeadpool, we need you for the debriefing. Get back to the conference room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade let out a little, high-pitched whine which made a small smile appear on Peter\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool, move it!\u201d Clint said again, and Wade reluctantly unfolded himself from his position on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said in his most petulant voice, \u201cbut I\u2019m taking this with me.\u201d He grabbed the tray with all of the food on it and held it close to chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool,\u201d Clint began, his voice low and dangerous, \u201cI do not have time for your shenanigans. Leave the poor boy his food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter put up his hands, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint gave him an assessing gaze, but finally nodded. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll see <em>you</em> later, Mr. Sex Appeal,\u201d Wade put in, winking saucily in Peter\u2019s direction before sauntering off.</p>\n<p>Clint strode after Wade, saying something along the lines of, \u201cNo you won\u2019t. You are not allowed to harass people trying to eat their own lunch. He might have let you eat it, but you <em>will</em> pay that kid back for whatever you stole from him today, got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll pay him back all right,\u201d Peter heard Wade say in his most seductive voice, and then Clint groaned and the door closed behind him, and Peter could hear nothing more.</p>\n<p>Peter smiled to himself and got up from the table, content to head back to work since Wade was no longer available to keep him company.</p>\n<p>Back in the lab Bruce was elbow deep in what looked like a torn-open toaster sprouting alfalfa, but he looked up when Peter walked in and asked, \u201cHow was lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a little laugh. \u201cNot too bad. Kind of got high jacked before it could really begin, but there\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Bruce looked interested. He removed his arms from the foliage and asked, \u201cHigh jacked? How?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a little wave. \u201cSome guy jumped in, and I didn\u2019t get to eat much. Actually, there were a lot of people jumping around, coming in and out. And by a lot, I mean three. But three is kind of a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cDo you know who they were?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing by what they were calling each other and the fact that I own a TV and actually watch the news, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Deadpool, though Deadpool doesn\u2019t really count because he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool? Really?\u201d His eyes got this far away look like he was seeing right past Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d When Bruce didn\u2019t immediately explain, Peter asked \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shook his head and refocused on the young man before him. \u201cWell, he\u2019s\u2026ah\u2026sort of a loose cannon at the moment. But he never really eats here? He socializes, sure, practically dotes on the rest of us when he isn\u2019t, you know, accidentally blowing things up, but he\u2019s always eager to get things done and get out.\u201d And then in an almost flippant tone, \u201cI wonder if he has someone waiting somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowned. \u201cWell, actually, yes, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>An alarm went off throughout the lab, cutting off what Peter was saying. Bruce quickly checked his phone and his eyes went wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apologies Peter, I\u2019ve got to go. Avengers stuff, you know? Terribly sorry.\u201d He was halfway out the door when he turned back and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this some other time, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded and Bruce left, but their conversation was soon the farthest thing from Peter\u2019s mind. He was a little preoccupied with whatever might be happening in New York that needed the Avengers. Wade was out there. And Spiderman couldn\u2019t help because Peter needed an alibi.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t thought this through. How was he supposed to fight crime without the Avengers noticing that Peter disappeared around the same time Spiderman showed up? The cameras placed everywhere around the tower kind of destroyed the possibility of sneaking out.</p>\n<p>But before he could get too caught up in <em>that</em> train of thought, his text alert went off, and he looked at his phone for a message from Wade:</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sorry Sweetums, might be a little late for dinny. Mutant rats attacking NYC again. Jeeeeezus. Love, Pookie, I mean Wadey, I mean honey-bear &lt;3</em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter gave the phone a slow smile before putting it away and getting down to work. He had a toaster to de-alfalfa.</p>\n<p>Day two of interning at SI was\u2026good. Tony had started calling Peter Peter, and had asked Peter to call Tony Tony. So, now he was on first-name basis with two of the Avengers. Time to celebrate!</p>\n<p>And then Tony asked Peter to help hack into SHIELD\u2019s database, and even though Peter knew that Tony was only asking to test him (because Hello! He was Tony Stark. He could fucking hack into the Pentagon, he didn\u2019t need help getting into SHIELD), and that it was really really really illegal, he did it because it was fun and Tony and his running commentary was hilarious and this was practically the best job ever!</p>\n<p>And then lunch! Which meant Wade time, and their first ever (not counting the failed attempt on day one) lunch break date. </p>\n<p>Bruce waved him off again, and even Tony was there to wish him happy eatings! </p>\n<p>Walking into the Cafeteria, Peter\u2019s face lit up because there was Wade, lounging on the table of the booth Peter had sat in the day before, with chimichangas and unopened bags of Fritos strewn across his chest. \u201cHey, Sexy Mama!\u201d Wade shouted from across the room and Peter could feel his face heat up and a smile tugged on his lips that refused to go away even as he tried to dampen it.</p>\n<p>He walked quickly over to Wade and snagged a bag of Fritos that had been lying innocently over Wade\u2019s left nipple. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve such a buffet laid out before me?\u201d Peter asked as he opened the bag and popped a handful of salty, orange curly, goodness into his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer the word smorgasbord, actually.\u201d Wade rolled his eyes and sat up, causing most of the food to fall unceremoniously to the booth. \u201cWell, honey-boo, Se\u00f1or Bow-and-Arrow insisted that I pay back \u201cthat poor boy\u201d and I thought, why not? You do so much for me, sweetums, why not give you a little something extra?\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestured down at himself and subsequently also the fritos and chimichangas that were lying in heaps on the bench below him.</p>\n<p>Peter snorted and shoved another handful of chips into his mouth. \u201cYou are perfect,\u201d Peter said slowly, trying to be understood around his mouthful of food.</p>\n<p>Wade gave a fluttery little hand gesture in the air between Peter and himself, and Peter could see the crease in his mask that meant that he was smiling widely beneath the layer of spandex. Before he could say anything, however, the sound of the cafeteria doors crashing open drew both of their attentions towards the two assassins who were making their way over to the booth that Wade was still lounging in.</p>\n<p>When Wade caught sight of them he whined. \u201cC\u2019mon guys? I didn\u2019t skip out on anything today! Leave me alone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawkeye grimaced at Wade and held out a hand to help Wade to his feet. Black Widow gave Peter an appraising look and Peter could totally tell why people would be horrified of her. As it was, Peter was a superhero, he was strong, so he only gulped the rest of his Fritos down, ignored the way the chips almost lodged in his throat, and tried to ignore the tensing of his shoulders. She looked him up and down before asking in an almost flippant tone, \u201cIs this guy bothering you?\u201d She jerked a thumb over at Wade who stuck his tongue out at her (not easily done in a mask).</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head emphatically, but Black Widow wasn\u2019t looking at him any longer. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool,\u201d she said quietly, and Peter could see that even Wade straightened up under her powerful gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, little missy?\u201d Wade said, in his most southern of Cowboy voices. He tipped an imaginary hat. \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Black Widow\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Steve wants to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what did I tell you about harassing\u2014\u201d Hawkeye started, but Wade interrupted him with a whine.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Cliiiiinnnt! I even took your advice, see?\u201d He waved his hands at the bag of Fritos in Peter\u2019s hand, and the pile of food strewn across the booth. \u201c<em>I</em> bought the food this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawkeye made a disgruntled noise and dragged Wade out of the room, Wade complaining the entire time.</p>\n<p>Peter was left with only the Black Widow and a pile of fast food for company. She let out a sigh and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSorry about him. He\u2019s not so bad really, but he doesn\u2019t seem to understand\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries, really!\u201d Peter interrupted her, and he waved his Fritos bag around to prove his point.</p>\n<p>Black Widow\u2019s eyes narrowed, but after only a few seconds of Peter being frozen in absolute terror under her gaze, she turned around and walked out. </p>\n<p>Peter let out a relieved sigh and slumped down into the booth. Only when he heard a muffled pop come from beneath him did he remember the bags of chips. He fished his cell out from his pocket, sent a quick <em>What did Captain America want? See you at home. Still having Enchiladas for dinner?</em> to Wade, gathered up the scattered food, and headed back to the lab. He could eat the Chimichangas and Fritos just as easily alone at his worktable as he could alone in the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wade said, from where he was, curled around Peter piggy-back style as Peter swung around New York in his Spiderman suit, \u201che actually talked about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s voice was uncharacteristically serious and that alone caused Peter to make a pit stop on the roof of an office building only half a mile from their apartment. Wade clambered off of Peter\u2019s back and sat on the edge of the building, his back to the skyline.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Peter asked and scratched the back of his head. He itched to take off his mask so he could run his fingers through his hair, a habit he just couldn\u2019t shake, even though it was a sure-fire way for anyone who knew him to be able to tell that he was confused.</p>\n<p>Wade kicked his feet against the concrete. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really paying attention, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>A snort escaped Peter before he could finish fully comprehending what Wade had said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade smiled up at Peter. \u201cHe called me in, all of the Avengers actually, and sat me down to talk about you, Petey-pie, but then I started thinking about all those chimichangas I just <em>left</em> there that I couldn\u2019t really concentrate. I mean, chimichangas, Baby Boy! And I just left them!\u201d He threw his hands in the air in a totally scandalized manner and Peter couldn\u2019t stop a smile from lighting his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Wade. I gathered them up. Then I ate some, \u2018cause I was hungry, but the left-overs are in the fridge at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade jumped to his feet and planted a spandex-on-spandex kiss on Peter\u2019s cheek. \u201cI love you so much!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed but then a zing went up his spine and he straightened.</p>\n<p>Wade lazily stretched. \u201cThat Spidey sense of yours tingling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter noded and scanned the surrounding area. There! He heard a scream coming from three alleys over.</p>\n<p>Peter looked over at where Wade lounged. \u201cComing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe later, sexy!\u201d Wade said and wiggled his hips suggestively. \u201cBut right now I think I\u2019ll let you take care of this. Too many sightings of Deadpool and Spidey teaming up and people are going to start getting <em>ideas</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter let out a short laugh and stepped onto the edge of the building. \u201cWe\u2019re <em>dating</em>, Wade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know that,\u201d Wade scoffed playfully, and made a shooing motion with his hand. \u201cGo on, then. I\u2019ll meet you at home, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded absent-mindedly and dove off the building. </p>\n<p>Another scream, this time a higher pitch.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s arm shot out, a string of web attaching itself to a corner of an office building, and then he was flying through the air, another shot of web, two more swings and he was dropping into a dark side street right behind a would-be mugger. The guy had a balaclava on and was pointing a gun at man in a polo shirt. Behind the man was a little girl with pigtails, polo\u2019s daughter probably, and her eyes lit up when she saw Peter behind the bad guy.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your money!\u201d The guy demanded, and he took a menacing step forward. The polo-man\u2019s hands were raised above his head and he too watched carefully as Spidey mimicked the bad-guy\u2019s movements behind the guy\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Peter noted that the man held the gun in a loose grip, and that his hand shook infinitesimally beneath the gun\u2019s weight. He was nervous. Definitely not a hardened criminal then. </p>\n<p>But, you know, still holding a gun to a dad and an eight-year-old (she looked eightish. Maybe nine. Ten. Maybe seven, whatever) was super not ok, so\u2026still going down.</p>\n<p>Peter poked the guy on the shoulder. \u201cYou know, balaclavas are sooo last year.\u201d The man spun around, but Peter was already using the man\u2019s shoulder as a hand hold, and then he swung up, kicked off the wall above the man\u2019s head, and clothes-lined the guy to the ground. \u201cNow I\u2019m not usually a fashion police sort of guy,\u201d Peter shrugged and looked down at the groaning man on the ground, \u201cbut I\u2019m used to a higher caliber bad-guy. Suits or something. Maybe a solid mask. None of that ski affair, half-price at Dick\u2019s or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man groaned again, and tried to aim his gun at Peter, but Peter made a tsking noise and shot a web at the gun. \u201cYoink!\u201d Peter pulled at the web and the gun came flying towards him which he caught effortlessly. </p>\n<p>A startled squeak behind him reminded Peter that he wasn\u2019t alone, and he turned to see the father-daughter pair hugging each other. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d Peter said and then patted the father\u2019s shoulder. Before the either of them could say anything Peter heard a shout from\u2026four blocks over? \u201cWell, tonight is going to be a busy night, I can tell already.\u201d He turned towards where he\u2019d heard the sound come from. \u201cByeee!\u201d he shouted over his shoulder as he webbed away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it about Tuesdays that have villains running every which way trying to ruin everyone\u2019s night?\u201d Peter asked himself as he soared through the city, slinging webs left and right.</p>\n<p>There\u2014was that a bear clinging to a fire escape?</p>\n<p>He swung closer.</p>\n<p>Yes. Yes it was. And it wasn\u2019t any baby bear or koala or anything, this was a full-grown grizzly hanging on to the outside of the fire escape rail for dear life.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not get paid enough for this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter dropped onto the sidewalk beneath the flailing bear where a group of concerned citizens were watching the bear struggle. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d he asked in what he hoped was his most authoritative tone.</p>\n<p>A woman with short dirty blonde hair wearing scrubs turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure? He\u2014it\u2014he was hanging there when I got home. Bev called the police\u201d a small wiry Asian woman waved at Peter \u201cbut they said to just wait for animal control to arrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t freaking you out? Even a little? I mean, I\u2019m Spiderman and this has even got me thrown.\u201d</p>\n<p>A man in a green work jacket spoke up. \u201cWell, yeah, this is really weird. But the poor thing\u2019s been stuck there for a few hours now\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014and we\u2019ve all kind of gotten used to him. Feel sorry for the guy of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bev spoke up, \u201cDo you think you could at least get him down? Animal control can take him somewhere nice, but I don\u2019t know how they plan on getting him to the ground first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. \u201cUh\u2026I can try.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first woman smiled, relieved. \u201cThanks, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter held up a hand, \u201cWait!\u201d he fished a vibrating phone out of a pocket he\u2019d sewn into his suit and saw that it was Wade calling. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take this,\u201d he swiped to answer and then held the phone up to his ear, \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hello, pookie</em>,\u201d Wade said on the other end of the line, \u201c<em>what\u2019re you up to?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked up at the bear. It was gnashing at the railing with its teeth, and one of its feet slipped off the steel floor. The beast trembled and tried to right itself without falling.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh nothing much. You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Making dinner, boo. Enchiladas, your favorite.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Same difference.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>With a small spurt of web, Peter\u2019s phone was stuck to his head, leaving his hands free. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not. Listen, babe, I might be a little late. I\u2019ll probably have to wait for the cops to show up for this one.\u201d He looked up at the bear again, tried to see what angle the creature would fall at, and began constructing a net beneath the bear with his webs.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why, what\u2019s up Petey-pie.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m on the job,\u201d he said, a hint of warning in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Spidey-poo then.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes and added another layer of webbing. The net was attached to the brick wall of the apartment complex, and one corner was attached to a stop sign and another to a trashcan.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m currently weaving a web to catch a bear with. And then I\u2019ll have to wait for the cops to protect the populace from said possible rampaging bear. Put the Enchiladas on low, they\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ooohh, are you bear-hunting?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter tested the web with his hands, pulling at different threads to make sure they would be strong enough to take the bear\u2019s weight.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that kind of catching. I\u2019m not running after some furry beast that could mangle me with one paw tied behind his back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Give yourself some credit, my arachnid lover. You\u2019re pretty resourceful.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat I mean is that there is a bear above me who might fall, and I\u2019m making a net to catch it before it hits the ground so if it falls I won\u2019t have to clean bear guts off the suit. And the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>The threads were holding. Test #2, Peter jumped onto the net and hopped up and down. Wheeeee! Bouncy! Maybe he should quit superheroing and go into the trampoline-making business. And yes, they were still holding.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How did a bear get up wherever it is?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one is really sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter patted at his phone to make sure it was adhered to his ear well, and then began scaling the wall of the apartment building.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Can we keep him?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Awwwwww! But we need a pet, Spidey Babey! Someone to keep me warm at night when you\u2019re off doing Spiderman things.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne, we don\u2019t need a pet. We are barely home enough to feed ourselves, never mind feeding an animal, and taking it out, and whatever people do with pets. Two, what do you mean keep you warm at night? Whenever I\u2019m doing Spiderman stuff, you\u2019re out too doing Dea\u2014\u201d Peter looked down at the mass of people who were all probably listening to his side of the conversation. \u201cYou know, you stuff. <em>And</em>, you are now part of an awesome boy-band, so really, I\u2019m alone more than you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter reached the bear, and this close he could tell how scared the creature really was. The bear\u2019s eyes were wide, his pupils dilated. There was foam dripping out of its mouth, and its head whipped back and forth, trying to look all around itself constantly. Peter reached a hand out slowly, trying not to startle the beast, but the bear swung at him with a free claw, and then proceeded to wobble on the railing from the sudden shifting of its weight.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>All the more reason to keep Teddy\u2014we can name the bear Teddy, right? It would just be a waste if we didn\u2019t\u2014around. He\u2019ll keep me company when you\u2019re gone, and keep you company when I\u2019m gone.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes narrowed, focusing on how to get the bear down safely, which limbs to incapacitate with his webbing that would cause the least amount of damage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <em>not</em> keeping the bear as a pet. We live in an <em>apartment</em>, W\u2014Babe. That\u2019s not enough room to keep a bear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shot a web at the bear\u2019s front paws, webbing them together, and then another web at his back paws, webbing <em>them</em> together.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019ll buy us a cabin somewhere in the woods. Then Teddy can roam free when neither of us are home.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The bear fell, having lost the ability to hold on to anything, and the crowd below gave a worried gasp, but Peter shot out another web which wrapped around the bear\u2019s limbs and caught the creature before it had dropped more than a few feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t buying us a cabin. We are not keeping a bear as a pet. Ok, actually, you can buy us a cabin, because it might be nice to spend some vacation time out in the forest. Nature is pretty cool, or so I hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lowered the bear slowly, adding more webbing to the rope to let the bear descend at an even pace.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>A romantic getaway!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The bear let out a confused growl but didn\u2019t fight against the web\u2019s hold on his paws.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Maybe in a few years, when New York quiets down a little, and they don\u2019t need Spiderman getting underfoot all hours of the day and night.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bear finally touched the net, and Peter released the web he was holding, letting he bear fall onto the trampoliney web-net.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Or our honey moon!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed and dropped down into a crouch next to the net where the bear was struggling to get upright. It was having a hard time, since what it was sitting on was constantly moving, and all of its limbs were out of commission.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you proposing?\u201d Peter asked, and it was playfully said, but then there was a pause on the other end of the line. Wade cleared his throat. And then again.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Actually\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shot to his feet. \u201cNo! No, you are doing this in person. I am coming right home, screw the bear. Wait! I\u2019ll be there in a sec! Oh my god!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter quickly twisted his web into a makeshift tent-like cage, trapping the rolling bear in its confines. Then he shot a web at the top of the apartment building and was swinging away.</p>\n<p>The last thing he heard before he swung off was the scrubs-lady asking, \u201cBut what about the bear? And animal control?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave an excited little laugh as he swung, and shouted back, hopefully loud enough to be heard, \u201cThe police can handle it, lady! I\u2019m a little busy at the moment, getting engaged!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter twisted his engagement ring (ENGAGEMENT RING!!!) around his ring finger as he stared at the computer at his work table in SI. Wade had actually proposed! It was awkward and wobbly, but very sweet and Peter had kissed him before he\u2019d even had time to say yes. And then he\u2019d said yes, and then kissed him again. His boyfriend\u2014no! His <em>fianc\u00e9</em> had then carried him off to the bedroom and they\u2019d spent quite a bit of time in there. That morning, before Peter had headed to work, Wade had thrown the ring (literally thrown it) at Peter. It was just a thin band made of steel, but it had Wade and Peter\u2019s names etched around the inside, and seeing their names curling around each other like that warmed Peter\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>He shook his head to clear his head. Yes, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about his fianc\u00e9. Yes, he was excited because he had a <em>fianc\u00e9</em>! But that didn\u2019t mean that he could get away with not focusing at work. He shook his head again and tried to focus on the microscope he was looking into. He adjusted the lens. </p>\n<p>Nope, just as fuzzy.</p>\n<p>He adjusted the lens again, drawing the particle into focus.</p>\n<p>A tap on Peter\u2019s shoulder had him turning around to look into the kind face of Dr. Banner.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, Tony and I were wondering if you wanted to eat lunch with us today?\u201d Peter raised his eyebrows, and Bruce went on to explain. \u201cWe just noticed that you\u2019ve been eating alone and we thought it might be nice to eat with friends. If you have other plans we understand, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head. \u201cHonestly, it sounds awesome, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My Anaconda Don\u2019t</em>\u201d Nicki Minaj sang from Peter\u2019s pants pocket. He blinked and dug his phone out. For some inexplicable reason, Wade was always changing the text alert on Peter\u2019s phone for when Wade messaged, and for the past month it had been Nicki Minaj. The text read, \u201c<em>Hola Boo-boo! Guess what? Imma hafta back out on lunch today sadface :( The avenging idiots are sending me out on recon? I don\u2019t know. Something far far below my obvious skill set, baby. I will meet you at home I guess. Unless you wanna play hookie and follow me to Wisconsin? I know, I know, you can\u2019t cuz you\u2019re a goodie two shoes :P I\u2019ll pick up Chinese on the way home. See ya later, snookums!!!!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked at his phone, let himself process what had just happened. Then he turned back to Bruce. \u201cUhhh\u2026 Nevermind? I\u2019d love to join you guys for food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce smiled and ran a hand through his salt and pepper curls. \u201cLunch plans fall through?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then you have no excuse not to eat with us. Come on. Gather your things. I think Pepper ordered Thai. You like Thai?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d Peter stuffed his phone back in his pocket, and the two of them headed to the elevator. </p>\n<p>When the doors closed, Bruce addressed Jarvis, \u201cJarvis, could you take us to the common room please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Dr. Banner,\u201d Jarvis said and his voice echoed almost ominously through the small room. Peter decided to chalk it up to his own accelerated heart rate, because Jarvis was a pretty cool guy, and Bruce didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d just heard something ominous. It was definitely all in Peter\u2019s head then. And speaking of why he might be a little frightened\u2026</p>\n<p> \u201cWait, are we venturing up into Avengers territory?\u201d The question ended with a little squeak that Peter would totally deny having spouted. </p>\n<p>Bruce grinned. \u201cYes sir-ee!</p>\n<p>Peter gulped and let out a high pitched giggle. \u201cLike, the Avengers? The actual Avengers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce gave a little pout. \u201cYou do know that me and Tony are Avengers too, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter waved his hands around his head. With ever floor they passed his stomach dropped a little farther. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say that it wasn\u2019t the same because he\u2019d already spent time with Tony and Bruce and felt safe with them, but they were going into territory where <em>more</em> people would be able to see him in his comfortable state, and do you know what would happen then? He would slip and people would figure out he was Spiderman, and then everything would change! These people were spies, and gods, and smart people and, and, and\u2014</p>\n<p>Peter swallowed the bile working its way up his throat and gave Bruce his calmest smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s just you know\u2014I <em>did</em> freak out about meeting the two of you as well, right? And now I\u2019m coming into the <em>house</em>\u2014the, the <em>living area</em> of really famous smart people, strong people? It\u2019s just kinda\u2014\u201d Peter\u2019s hands flew up around his head in the international sign for BOOM, \u201cwhoa. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce gave Peter a guilty look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t even think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s fine! Really, I just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The elevator gave a little ding as the doors opened, and Bruce led Peter out into the living area. Peter felt <em>no</em> qualms about staring at the area, and <em>yes</em> that was a little bit because he was in <em>the Avenger\u2019s home</em> and he was still a fanboy. But then he found himself not just checking out the half-circle of leather couch and the giant TV, and the big circular dining room table, but also checking all of the windows for latches for easy access, and doors that could lead outside, escape routes. His eyes skimmed over the kitchen, noting all of the knives and their placement so he could see if one was missing. </p>\n<p>Only when his mind completely bypassed Tony and Ms. Potts who were both sitting at the giant dining room table with cartons of food in front of them, arguing at each other beneath their breath did Peter shake himself out of super hero mode and force himself to relax.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d Peter said at a deadpan, just loud enough for the two to be heard.</p>\n<p>Tony swung his head around and a giant grin blossomed on his face. \u201cPeter! Hotstuff!\u201d Then he turned to Bruce. \u201cSo the retrieval mission was a success. Good going Banner!\u201d</p>\n<p>Banner scratched the back of his head, a light blush dabbing at his cheeks. </p>\n<p>Ms. Potts motioned for Peter and Bruce to take a seat, and then started dishing out plates of delicious smelling food items that Peter could not pronounce. \u201cSo Peter, may I call you Peter?\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cWell, how do you like it here at Stark Industries. I haven\u2019t had time to talk to you since your first day here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled at the red-head. \u201cI love it, I really do! Tony is great and Bruce is great and everything is just really great.\u201d It seemed that Peter had suddenly lost his ability to locate any variety of adjectives at all.</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts laughed. \u201cWell that\u2019s good. I know Tony talks very highly of you, which means something, believe me, but it\u2019s good to hear it from the victim\u2019s own mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVictim!\u201d Peter laughed, relaxing now that <em>someone</em> was being rude to him, in the kindest of ways of course. Peter turned to Bruce and asked in a faux whisper, \u201cDoes she know she\u2019s a CEO?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce snorted to cover a laugh and reached out for the plate Pepper was handing him.</p>\n<p>Tony put on an affronted look. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that my girlfriend is the best CEO there ever was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts gave him a knowing look and held out Peter\u2019s plate for him to take. But, when Peter reached a hand out to receive it, Ms. Potts gasped. Not really an expected response. All he\u2019d wanted was some food. He hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, had he? Peter instinctually pulled his hand back, but Ms. Potts grabbed it and pulled it towards her, hauling Peter bodily across the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is new!\u201d the woman accused, pointing at Peter\u2019s engagement ring (ENGAGEMENT RING!!!).</p>\n<p>Peter blushed. \u201cIt is,\u201d he conceded.</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts squealed, but it was Tony who spoke next. \u201cWait, you\u2019re married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEngaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts rolled her eyes. \u201cOh my god, Tony. It\u2019s been less than a week. I don\u2019t think Peter could have gone from unengaged to married in three days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could have eloped!\u201d Tony said, defending himself with an irritated huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Bruce said, and held his hand out. Peter shook it firmly, a smile on his face and a blush suffusing his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSooooo,\u201d Tony asks, waggling his eyebrows, \u201cyou\u2019ve got a fianc\u00e9 now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded giddily. \u201cHe actually proposed last night. Tried to do it over the phone he got so flustered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Potts laughed and handed Peter his plate, and they all dug in while Peter talked about Wade. It was really nice to finally be able to talk someone about his boyfriend. Peter didn\u2019t have many friends. Any, really. Some acquaintances in classes, but being Spiderman really put a damper on his social life, and it wasn\u2019t often that he was able to extol Wade\u2019s romantic gestures or wax lyrical about his boyfriend. Of course, by this point, it was obvious that not only did no one <em>know</em> Peter was dating Wade, but they probably wouldn\u2019t approve of it, and Peter wanted this lunch to be light and happy, so he never mentioned Wade by name. But that didn\u2019t seem to matter to the others, and they teased him mercilessly about it nonetheless. Peter smiled. It was nice feeling this comfortable, and that was enough to let Peter finally relax</p>\n<p>While Peter was busy blushing as he rambled on about his boyfriend, and while Pepper facilitated his obsession and excitement by asking questions about Peter and the boy\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Tony and Bruce locked eyes and exchanged quick nods. A short pact to protect such an innocent boy.</p>\n<p>When Peter left for work the next day, Wade gave him a good morning kiss and promised to definitely eat lunch with him that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Instead when lunch hour rolled around, Peter got a text that said, \u201c<em>Hola again, Sexy bear. I\u2019ve got more bad news. They\u2019re sending me off to reconstruct the irish mafia, or something. I\u2019m not really sure. In fact, I think this is all a deep-seated plot to keep me from eating with my boyfriend, since I\u2019m always being sent off just when his lunch break starts.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sent him a text with only one word, a correction: \u201c<em>Fianc\u00e9.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade responded with an emoticon of a wedding ring, and text that said \u201c<em>Love you. See you at home, Sweetie-Petey?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>So, when Bruce asked, \u201cYou going to join us for lunch today?\u201d Peter could do nothing but shrug.</p>\n<p>In the elevator Bruce warned him, \u201cTony and Pepper couldn\u2019t make it today. Something about having to run a company?\u201d He gave such a mockingly confused expression that Peter couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is it just you and me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shook his head. \u201cNo. Thor and Steve will be there too. Steve is cooking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gulped, and he could feel the blood draining from his face, but he refused to walk into the trap of scared intern meeting saviors of the human race clich\u00e9, so he squared his shoulders and held his head up high. In his periphery he could see Bruce struggling to keep a straight face.</p>\n<p>The doors opened and Bruce led Peter back to the dining room where Captain America (cue fanboyish screech) was dishing out meatloaf and mashed potatoes, and Thor was spinning his hammer above his head almost absent-mindedly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Peter whispered at Bruce out of the side of his mouth, and Peter could see his lips quirk upwards in a quick sketch of a smile before stepping ahead of Peter and into the room. </p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, Thor, I\u2019d like you to meet Peter Parker. Peter interns with Tony down in R&amp;D mostly, though he sometimes helps me out too. Peter, this is Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America,\u201d Peter gave him a dirty look (as if he wouldn\u2019t know who Captain America was!) and Bruce smirked back at him, \u201cand Thor Odinson, a visitor to Earth from Asgard.\u201d </p>\n<p>Thor gave a little wave and the Captain wiped his hands off on a little towel before sticking out his hand for Peter to shake. \u201cCall me Steve, please.\u201d Being this close to Captain America was almost making Peter swoon, but he forced himself to do nothing but smile and say, \u201cThen call me Peter,\u201d instead of fainting or demanding an autograph or jumping out the window.</p>\n<p>Hellooooo! This was Captain-Fucking-America!</p>\n<p>Thor stood and stuck his hand out awkwardly. \u201cI have been told that it is custom on Midgard to shake hands good-naturedly. I welcome you Peter of Parker. Perhaps we shall fight side by side some day and become not only comrades and friends but also brothers in blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked, and he could hear Steve snorting a little in the background, but Peter was adaptable if nothing else. In tenth grade there had been a Vietnamese foreign exchange student in his English class and everyone else had stumbled their way around talking to her, but Peter had been taught to accept people for who they were, no matter differences caused by language barriers or cultural differences. Thor was no different than Ngon.</p>\n<p>Peter shook Thor\u2019s hand firmly and smiled. \u201cI am afraid I wouldn\u2019t be much help in battle, but I am really honored that you would count me as worthy to fight beside. It would be great to count you as my friend.\u201d He gave as big a smile as he could muster and Thor let loose a booming laugh that rattled the windows.</p>\n<p>\u201cI very much like this one. Peter of Parker, we shall be brothers, if not in battle than is camaraderie!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Steve said, motioning to the food laid out on the table, \u201clunch is ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sat around the table, and it was no time before Peter was stuffing his face. He\u2019d missed breakfast that morning, and had been on patrol late into the night, burning off more calories than he\u2019d had time to replace.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Peter said around a mouth of delicious, home-made mashed potatoes, \u201cWhat\u2019s Asgard like?\u201d</p>\n<p>And they were off. </p>\n<p>As it turns out Thor could talk about his homeland for an extraordinary amount of time. He talked about his father, Odin, mother Frigga, even his brother, Loki, who Peter knew had had a hand in the whole New York being destroyed by aliens thing. But that was ok, because family was family, and in all probability, if Aunt May went on a horrible rampage and killed lots of people, yes Peter would take her out (arrest! Not kill!), but he\u2019d still love her and be proud of her accomplishments pre-murder. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Lady Sif swung at him with such force that he flew backwards, right off of the tower. We were frightened that he might have become damaged during such a fall, but when we looked over the edge, there was Volstagg hanging from the parapet by his finger tips.\u201d He laughed, and though Peter hadn\u2019t comprehended most of the story (it was confusing with all the different names and places, and people\u2019s relationships to Thor and each other) he still laughed, because even just watching Thor tell stories of daring deeds was funny since he gesticulated so wildly to prove points and to explain actions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you, young friend?\u201d Thor asked when his mirth had lessened. \u201cDo you have any tales of amazing feats? Adventures?\u201d</p>\n<p>If only he knew. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter said with a small chuckle, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the closest I\u2019ve come to any life-or-death adventuring were my SATs. Horrifying, those were.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor banged his fist down on the table, his lips stretched into a hearty grin. \u201cYou must tell me of Esaytees. They are some monster no doubt. How did you defeat this Esaytee?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce held up a hand to hide his mouth but he couldn\u2019t hide his chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Peter explained through his own smile, \u201cThe SAT is an examination testing a person\u2019s worth concerning intelligence and knowledge. It is an assessment that you have to take before you can apply to college, or um, higher education? Depending on your score, it might be easier or harder to get into a college, a place of education, that is more prestigious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor nodded sagely. \u201cAh yes. The hardest battles are always of the mind. Memory is a fickle mistress, and knowledge an unruly beast. You are very smart then, Peter of Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blushed. \u201cI do ok. And please, just call me Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor laughed again. \u201cPeter then, my wise comrade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sent Bruce a pleading look, but the scientist just shook his head. Instead it was Steve who saved him.</p>\n<p>Captain America cleared his throat. \u201cWell, Peter, how do you like interning here? You work for Tony in his shop, correct?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cAnd sometimes with Bruce too. We\u2019re currently studying this interesting vein of vegetation, a mutation if you will, that reacts to iodized metals of all things. It does not need fertilizer, or even sun or water as far as we can tell, in order to flourish.\u201d Steve gave a slow blink, and Peter took that to mean that he should explain in more basic terms. \u201cFor some reason there are alfalfa sprouts growing in one of Tony\u2019s old old old machines, a toaster, and we\u2019re trying to figure out how and why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smirked a little. \u201cAnd you like working for Tony?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but he\u2019s a genius, always has another angle to look at, it\u2019s great. And it\u2019s good to be able to do science without having to worry about grades all the time. Homework is just such a hassle. And tests, dear god I want to stab my eyes out around finals. No, this is great, all the fun without any of the repercussions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you can slack, you know,\u201d Bruce threatened good-naturedly around a slice of meatloaf.</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d Peter drew an X over his heart with his finger. Then he turned back to Steve, \u201cWould it be awful if I asked you a question about the Avengers? Or actually I just mean, like, when you fight in general? I know you probably get these all the time, and I don\u2019t mean to be all fan-y about it, so totally tell me if I can\u2019t and I won\u2019t bother you, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve almost choked trying to laugh with a mouth full of mashed potatoes. When he finally caught his breath he said, \u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk,\u201d he took a deep breath, \u201cwhen you take off the cowl after fights, do you have bed head?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce full on spit the remnants of meatloaf in his mouth across the table and succeeded not at all in trying to keep himself from laughing. Thor looked confused for a moment and turned to Steve. \u201cFriend-Steve, I too would like to know how you keep your locks looking so well-kept after hours in your helmet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it <em>doesn\u2019t</em> do the bed head thing?\u201d Peter confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNay,\u201d Thor intoned darkly, \u201cit does not.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d Peter drew the word out slowly.</p>\n<p>Steve blinked in confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s just hair, guys. It does what it wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Steve,\u201d Peter insisted, \u201cI put on my\u2026helmet, for my bike that I totally own, or a hat, for even just a second, and the moment it comes off my hair is everywhere!\u201d He gestured with his fork towards his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty. And a comb doesn\u2019t do nearly enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you have that,\u201d Bruce also pointed toward Peter\u2019s head with his fork, \u201canti-gravity follicle thing going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know Bruce, one of these days Tony is going to ask me to help him prank you, and I\u2019m going to say yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce rolled his eyes. \u201cNow that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Looking back at the good captain, Peter could see him combing his hair with his fingers self consciously. Peter sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t mean anything by it, really. I\u2019m just kind of jealous. Are you sure you don\u2019t\u2026 do something to it? To make it stay all nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shook his head, bewildered.</p>\n<p>Thor looked down at his hands where they rested on the table. \u201cThen it is a dark day indeed.\u201d He too took a moment to thread his fingers through his hair.</p>\n<p>Steve tried to get out of whatever hole he\u2019d fallen into by changing the subject. \u201cSo, you\u2019re a fan of the Avengers, I think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave Steve a nasty look. \u201cDuh. I mean, hellooo, you like saved the city and America and the world. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce grimaced. \u201cA lot of things. There was a lot of damage during the Chitauri incident and many people blame the Avengers for all of the destroyed buildings, rightfully so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve too nodded, a guilty look on his face.</p>\n<p>Peter could empathize. Sometimes doing your best wasn\u2019t good enough and stuff got wrecked. Sometimes even people got hurt, innocents caught in the crossfire, or hostages. Saving people was not an easy job, and it certainly wasn\u2019t one that came without casualties, whether they be human or inanimate. </p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I guess you\u2019re kind of right on that one. The Avengers are at least partially to blame for the knocked down buildings.\u201d Bruce put down his fork and sighed. \u201cBut! Don\u2019t get me wrong, yeah you did some damage, but without you it would have gone a lot worse. We all would have <em>died</em>! I would be dead right now.\u201d Peter looked past Steve, out the giant glass windows that made up the walls of this floor. His gaze skittered over the skyline that New York was famous for and the blue skies. \u201cAnd all of that would be gone. I know it sounds callous to say that there were acceptable casualties, but a few buildings are worth the lives of millions of people! Whoever doesn\u2019t get that can go shove a\u2014 a\u2014 I don\u2019t know, but not something nice, and not anywhere nice either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded his head decisively and put on a stern expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so yeah,\u201d Peter continued when no one spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of the Avengers. You save the world, or whatever. It\u2019s pretty cool. Pluuuuss, I might have been a fan of Captain America since literally forever. My Uncle Ben started buying me Captain America comics when I was four and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve laughed a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen Steve is your favorite of the Avengers?\u201d Bruce asked.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly the only one with comics with his face on them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor leaned in closer. \u201cIf it is not Steven, then who is your favorite of the Avengers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed a little hysterically. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Um, you guys all work so well together. I mean, the fact that Iron Man incorporates his knowledge of mechanics and quantum physics into making and piloting his suit is pretty rad. And of course, Captain, you\u2019ve got that wicked, jumping around, motorcycle riding, shield thing going on. Knocking bad guys in the head with a glorified Frisbee, no offense, is pretty legit. And Bruce, you get all big and angry, but no, I\u2019m actually sorry, you\u2019re kind of a victim of human experimentation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce held up his hands. \u201cI understand. The other guy doesn\u2019t exactly have much finesse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a guilty little shrug, but continued. \u201cThor, you\u2019re amazing ability to harness weather is, well, amazing, and you can fly with a hammer. Mind blown! And Hawkeye has like mad skills with a bow and arrow. Like, he can hit anything! I\u2019ve seen the news footage, his aim is fantastic. But, you know, I think Black Widow might actually be my favorite, objectively speaking. In person she\u2019s kind of horrifying, but in the field she\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure,\u201d Bruce asked with an innocent expression so genuine it had to be fake, \u201cthat your decision has nothing to do with the face that Natasha fights in skin tight leather?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stuck his tongue out at Bruce. \u201cOh shut it, Banner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor laughed at Bruce\u2019s affronted expression and Steve said, \u201cWell now we know that he\u2019s learning more than just mechanics with Tony. At this rate Peter will have the sass of a Stark in a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019ve always been this sassy. I\u2019m a witty guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce gave him a deprecating look. \u201cUh-huh. You aren\u2019t getting off that easy. Why is Tasha your favorite Avenger, especially over me, the incredible Mr. Green.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cI guess, at least partially it\u2019s because of the way she\u2019s completely able to control her body. I mean, have you seen those acrobatics? What is she, an Olympic-level gymnast or something? It\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, awesome, but still ridiculous. And then there\u2019s the fact that she named herself Black Widow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Steve asked.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve got a certain fondness for spider based super heroes. I grew up in Forest Hills, attended Midtown High, that\u2019s all Spiderman territory. We were rooting for him before the lizard and electro. He was saving our hides back when he was just a little guy.\u201d He blushed a little, embarrassed to be talking about himself, \u201cAnd he kind of does the gymnast thing too. Have you seen youtube videos of him fighting bad guys? It\u2019s all flip, flip, flip, contortion, web in the face. Black Widow is like a, uh, better version? A more grown up, constrained, knows what she\u2019s doing version?\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, Peter would kill for a one-on-one sparring session with the Black Widow as Spiderman. She was like, the master. Everything he could do, she could do better (minus the webbing and the sticking to things and the actual physical strength gifted to him by having spider stuff in his DNA). The things she could teach him. He could have swooned just thinking about it.</p>\n<p>Thor grinned. \u201cThen you praise Warrior Natasha for her skills and likeness to a hero closer to your home. That is honorable and commendable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. \u201cThanks, I think. Oh, wait! You\u2019ve got W\u2014Deadpool on your team now, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve winced a little.</p>\n<p>Bruce looked incredulous. \u201cAre you going to switch from the impossibly impressive assassin that is the Black Widow to the Merc with a Mouth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gives a little shrug. \u201cWell, he has at least given up his job as a mercenary.\u201d And then a little more darkly, \u201cAs far as we know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. Wade had actually given up taking jobs as a mercenary around the time him and Peter had gotten together. Peter wouldn\u2019t have been able to, like, morally, date a guy who killed people for money. It was just one of those things. Some people couldn\u2019t date blondes, some couldn\u2019t date people who never put down the lid on the toilet, Peter couldn\u2019t date murderers. So yeah, Wade was murder-less. And now that he thought of it, what kind of fianc\u00e9 was he that his boyfriend wasn\u2019t even his favorite Avenger. Granted Wade was on, like, temporary, you-aren\u2019t-a-real-Avenger-yet level, but still.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeadpool\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Peter shrugged. \u201cHe works with Spiderman sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve seemed to relax a little. \u201cSo it\u2019s more of a home team sort of thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. \u201cI guess. How\u2019s he doing, by the way. He\u2019s kind of an Avenger now, right? How is that working out?\u201d</p>\n<p>It would be nice to hear from an unbiased source, AKA not Wade.</p>\n<p>Thor frowned. \u201cThe Water of Death makes many references that I do not understand, but I do know that he does not take this job as seriously as one should.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter almost spit hearing Wade being called \u201cWater of Death\u201d but held it in. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s a funny kind of guy. Both funny, ha ha, and funny, like weird. I think he plays at being more flippant than he actually is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gave Peter a look he couldn\u2019t identify, but instead of saying anything about it he asked, \u201cWhen do you guys have to return to work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looked at his watch and cursed, \u201cShi\u2014I mean we\u2019re late. C\u2019mon Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce stood from his seat and smoothed down his lab coat almost self-consciously, while Peter tried to quickly shove the rest of his food into his mouth before standing up.</p>\n<p>He swallowed quickly, wincing as a chunk of food too large for comfort squeezed itself down his esophagus. \u201cIt was nice meeting you guys. Maybe we could hang out some time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve nodded and stood to shake Peter\u2019s hand once more. \u201cI\u2019d like that. You\u2019re an interesting kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVerily,\u201d Thor agreed. \u201cSomeday we shall speak more of your knowledge-garnering abilities and hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed and gave a short wave before scampering off to follow Bruce back to the lab. And the toaster.</p>\n<p>By the next Wednesday, Peter was starting to think that he\u2019d never actually get to hang out with his boyfriend at work, even though they both worked in the same building. It was ridiculous. Every day he\u2019d plan to eat with Wade, and then around lunchtime he\u2019d get a text from Wade saying that the Avenger were sending him off into the wide blue world. On the other hand, he\u2019s been eating with some combination of Avengers every day, so that was pretty cool, and they were all really awesome people, but it still didn\u2019t beat actually eating lunch with Wade.</p>\n<p>And sure enough, just as lunch hour rolled around, Peter got a text from Wade saying he couldn\u2019t make it today either. If it had been anyone else, Peter would have wondered why they hadn\u2019t just blown up by now and insisted on being free for lunch, but this was Wade. His biggest dream was working for the Avengers. He might bitch and moan every time someone forced him to do work, but he honestly wouldn\u2019t jeopardize life as an Avenger by slacking off.</p>\n<p>Peter understood, honestly he did, and he still got to see Wade at home like normal. But that was just it! One of the reasons he was so hyped to work at SI was because he thought he\u2019d be able to see Wade more. And he loved his job, yeah, but he wanted to see Wade at work at least <em>some</em> of the time.</p>\n<p>And maybe Peter had a guardian angel after all. </p>\n<p>After lunch with Pepper (the only person available to eat with, the Avengers off doing Avenger stuff) in her office (where she insisted he call her Pepper, even though she was CEO of the company he interned for), he went back to his lab and hadn\u2019t walked two feet in the door before Peter\u2019s phone began insisting that it didn\u2019t want none unless Peter got buns, hun.</p>\n<p>The text from Wade said: \u201c<em>I know I missed lunch again, boo-boo, but I thought that since I missed seeing your face devour tacos once again, that I\u2019d swing by your office (get it? Swing? Because I\u2019m dating a spider?) and chill out. Just the two of us, Sexy. Plus, I haven\u2019t seen where my spidey-bear works yet and that is sacrilege!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter paused before sending back a response. He wasn\u2019t sure what the protocols were for inviting significant others into the work space. This was the lab where Bruce Banner and Tony Stark worked, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of through-traffic, but it wasn\u2019t off-limits to non-sciency people either. Pepper came in often enough, though she was the CEO, so her access to the building should be unlimited, so maybe that didn\u2019t count? But the other Avengers dropped in occasionally, and even though Wade was Peter\u2019s boyfriend/fianc\u00e9, he was still an Avenger. He was probably allowed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sure. Swing by. Literally. If you don\u2019t physically swing through the door than I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A loud screeching noise that sounded suspiciously like his boyfriend echoed through floor, and before he could think about it, there was the sound of boots pounding on tile, the doors of the lab flew open, and there was Wade, dressed to the nines in his typical red and black, shooting a grappling hook at the ceiling. Then he swung in.</p>\n<p>Peter let out a cheery laugh as Wade dropped down next to him and drew him into a languid kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cHola, boo-boo,\u201d Wade whispered into Peter\u2019s mouth once he had let up.</p>\n<p>Peter nodded, trying to catch his breath, and leaned against his table.</p>\n<p>Wade took the time to look around him. \u201cSo this is where you work, huh? Well, it does feel very sciency.\u201d Wade adjusted the settings of the microscope and swung one of the computer screens haphazardly. \u201cVery you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grinned up at his boyfriend. \u201cNice to see you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade giggled. \u201cYes. I can finally have office sex with my hot boyfriend while our bosses are away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cNo office sex, especially not with JARVIS everywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade harrumphed and crossed his arms over his chest petulantly. \"What\u2019s the point of getting us alone if no office sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really even an office.\u201d Then his eyes narrowed, \u201cWait! You said \u2018getting us alone\u2019\u2026 Did you have anything to do with the Avengers being sent away?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade grinned wildly (it may seem like a weird adjective to use to describe a smile, but anything was possible where Wade was concerned). \u201cWinky face!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just say an emoticon at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t say \u2018semi-colon end parenthesis.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly not much of an improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gasped melodramatically in faux-shock. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWade, emoticons were invented to show emotions in writing, you know a fake face when a real face isn\u2019t available. Your face is <em>right here</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade stuck out his lower lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d Peter explained, \u201cis that you could have just winked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have, duh! But it isn\u2019t the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLies!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cLook, emoticons said out loud are almost useless. The subtleties of body language cannot be accurately represented through a series of words representing punctuation facsimiles of said emotional responses!\u201d </p>\n<p>Wade paused to think through what Peter had just said. And in response said \u201cColon, capital P.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter threw up his hands, but a small smile lit his lips. \u201cYou are hopeless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLess-than symbol, three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Peter deadpanned, his arms crossed firmly across his chest.</p>\n<p>Then, like a descending angel, Hawkeye dropped onto the scene.</p>\n<p>Peter jumped back. \u201cThe fuck? Dude, what were you doing up there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade, who had not been affected by a full grown man dropping from the ceiling at all, said, \u201cI think he lives up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. \u201cIs he right? Is that where you live slash how you travel? I swear I\u2019ve only ever seen you enter rooms through the ventilation system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade nodded in agreement and then shook himself. \u201cWait! Why are you here? I thought you guys were all doing important Avengers things!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI came back a little early.\u201d Clint looked between the two a little confused. \u201cAre you two getting along? I saw Deadpool down here and figured he was bothering you, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded slowly. \u201cUh, yeah. We\u2019re getting along fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade unholstered one of his guns and aimed it at various pieces of technology around the room. \u201cYeah! And I haven\u2019t even started shooting up the place yet!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawkeye\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWere you thinking about doing that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade made little pew-pew noises as he mimicked shooting different parts of the room. Peter huffed out a laugh, an indulgent expression on his face. He couldn\u2019t help it. Wade\u2019s antics made Peter happy. And no doubt if anyone else mimed shooting up a science lab, Peter would have webbed them to the wall, but this was Wade.</p>\n<p>Hawkeye looked between the two of them, a confused expression on his face, but instead of saying anything he just let out a sigh and grabbed one of Wade\u2019s arms. \u201cOk, Deadpool. I know hanging out with interns is fun, but it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Wade squealed as he tried to squirm out of Hawkeye\u2019s hold. </p>\n<p>Hawkeye shook his head, and Peter could almost see his resolve hardening. \u201cWe\u2019ve got things to do. Avengers things. Things that are not bothering the scientist Tony and Bruce work with.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Clint manhandled a whining Wade out of the door, Peter couldn\u2019t help but say, just loudly enough for them to hear him as they left, in an almost petulant tone, \u201cHe <em>wasn\u2019t</em> bothering me.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, yes, Peter had been hanging out with the Avengers for a few weeks now, and it was pretty great. Running around town as Spiderman, he\u2019d always wondered if he\u2019d someday run into the Avengers, at least for more than a few seconds, and it was a little surprising that it was as Peter that he got to do it. Plus they were like, heroes! Real heroes! Not that he wasn\u2019t a real hero, but still they were like, the real heroes.</p>\n<p>Plus they were all super cool people besides. It was great just chatting with people. And they all seemed to like him, which was weird. Not weird because he didn\u2019t think he was likable, but because they were the <em>Avengers</em>, and he was just some kid. A smart kid, but not someone who should be on their radar at all (and thinking that made him panic, for just a second, he swore! But for that one second he couldn\u2019t help but think that they\u2019d found out he was Spiderman after all, and that they were just playing nice until they had time to unmask him and take him in to Shield for being a vigilante and arrest him or worse. But then he threw that thought out the window because he\u2019d <em>definitely</em> know if they suspected him. Spidey sense was good for something, after all).</p>\n<p>And it was more than just lunch! Because yeah, most days he ate with at least some of the Avengers, but some of them also stopped by the lab to just chill. Steve was there most often, and he\u2019d sit in the corner with a sketch pad and a number of pencils and charcoals and he\u2019d just sketch, Peter would work on whatever Tony or Bruce had thrown at him earlier that day, and sometimes they\u2019d chat, and sometimes they would just sit in comfortable silence.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Wade would show up and (Peter loved those times the best because) Wade would just fly in like some sort of storm, leaving confusion in his wake. He\u2019d threaten to shoot up the place, or flirt, and though Peter tried to keep it professional, he couldn\u2019t help blushing any time Wade tried anything funny in the lab. But those times were always getting shorter because Hawkeye (\u201cCall me Clint, I swear to fuck. I like Hawkeye fine in the field, but this is my relax-y place. Thank you, Jesus.\u201d) would drop from the vents like frigging reverse deus ex machina and haul Wade away to finish his paperwork (and at home one night, curled in on each other on the couch, Golden Girls in the background, Peter asked \u201cI suppose you couldn\u2019t just do it on time? Then he wouldn\u2019t have an excuse to drag you away.\u201d Wade had shrugged and said, \u201cPaperwork is annoying. I \u2018d rather just go shoot things.\u201d Peter had smiled and given him a kiss.).</p>\n<p>And Peter was also starting to get to know Clint and Black Widow better as well. (Clint had immediately insisted he be called by his first name. Black Widow sometimes glared him down if he took too long to answer a question. There was no familiarity there.) They also sometimes took to hanging out in the lab. Clint was funny, so Peter always counted him as good company. You never had to look far for a laugh if Clint was in the vicinity, and that was doubly true if Tony was in residence as well. The banter practically flew between the two of them. It was like watching a tennis tournament.</p>\n<p>Black Widow never really talked much, but if you asked her a question very politely (not like Peter had asked her anything with anything less than perfect manners, thank you Aunt May) she would answer easily enough. It was at first disconcerting (and continued to be, if Peter was being honest) because she\u2019d just sit in a corner of the room picking dirt from under her fingernails with a dagger, but Peter just had to know if she really could flip a man into a choke hold with only her thighs, because Spiderman could do it, but all he had is his new-ish (still) instincts and moves he\u2019d seen on TV, and if someone with actual skillz could give him some advice that would be super! And so he\u2019d asked her, and she\u2019d continued cleaning her fingernails for another minute, making Peter fidget horribly and consider turning around and hiding under a rock, but then she\u2019d flipped the dagger around in her hand, sheathed it, and began detailing exactly how one might go about flipping a man into a choke hold using only one\u2019s thighs, and she did it in the most logical and scholarly way. It was almost like listening to a lecture for one of his classes. And when she finished she asked if he had any questions (which he didn\u2019t because he already kind of understood the idea of it, and what he hadn\u2019t known she had been very thorough in explaining), he shook his head, and she returned to cleaning her nails with the dagger.</p>\n<p>But, now that Peter thought about it, those three came in often: Steve, Clint, and Black Widow, but they never overlapped. It was almost like they were taking turns.</p>\n<p>Peter blinked, and sat back from his microscope.</p>\n<p>Why didn\u2019t they ever overlap? If they were coming by just to chill with him, it would make sense that sometimes there would already be someone in the room when one showed up.</p>\n<p>Peter frowned, and looked over at where Clint was intensely playing Candy Crush on his phone. It was just the two of them in the room.</p>\n<p>Peter furrowed his brow. That is actually how it usually was. Sometimes someone, Clint or Steve would come in when Tony or Bruce was in residence, but it was often when they had stepped out for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Were they guarding him? Taking different watches, like prison guards? Or security guards? Did they think he was going to steal something?</p>\n<p>Peter tried to subtly study Clint. Clint was not watching Peter. He wasn\u2019t watching Peter at all.</p>\n<p>Maybe bodyguards?</p>\n<p>Peter almost laughed, why would they be protecting him? What would they be protecting him <em>from</em>?</p>\n<p>He was probably being ridiculous. </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like there was someone after him, someone who was coming for him. In fact the only people he ever saw with real regularity were Pepper and the Avengers. And Wade of course, but Wade didn\u2019t count because he was an Avenger. And Peter\u2019s fianc\u00e9. There\u2019d be no reason to protect him from Wade.</p>\n<p>But the idea was stuck in Peter\u2019s head, and it became apparent that he was wrong. The more he thought about it, the more obvious it became. They never left him alone with Wade. If Wade showed up, he was always dragged off to finish paperwork, and he was always sent on missions at the exact time when Peter was eating lunch.</p>\n<p>They were protecting him from his own fianc\u00e9.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t help but let out a small snort of amusement at that, and he waved off Clint\u2019s questioning glance. It suddenly felt like he\u2019d been thrust into an on-going game, and everyone else knew the rules, but until this moment, he hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d been playing. But now he knew! And he was definitely going to win!</p>\n<p>The next day before heading off to work, Peter left Wade a note telling him to meet Peter at the Pizzeria down the block from SI for lunch. </p>\n<p>It was best to just leave Wade directions like that. If they had talked, they might have debated about any number of things from whether or not Wade could get away from work to if they really had to have pizza because Wade had been craving nachos and he knew this great place, only a five minute walk away, and oh please, Peter! Please! How can you say no to nachos?</p>\n<p>So he left a note and went to work.</p>\n<p>In the lab he couldn\u2019t stop smiling, causing Bruce and Tony to both look at him funny. But when Bruce asked why he was smiling so much, Peter just said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m meeting my boyfriend for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce gave him a rueful smile. \u201cThat mean you\u2019re abandoning us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded.</p>\n<p>Bruce gave a faux-dramatic sigh and said, \u201cI guess that\u2019s fine. See you after lunch?\u201d And Peter smiled and nodded before rushing out to meet Wade at Lorito\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Wade was already there, in a booth in the back with an extra large half-hawaiian, half-meat lovers on the table. The pizza was even untouched. Wade had waited. Though his mask was already pushed up past his nose, so obviously he wasn\u2019t going to wait much longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, snookums,\u201d Wade said softly when Peter reached the booth, and leaned across the pizza for a long kiss.</p>\n<p>When Peter sat back he was out of breath and blushing, but couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how is work?\u201d Peter asked.</p>\n<p>Wade shrugged. \u201cA little busy, I guess. We found some remnants of Hydra in, like, Cambodia yesterday, so I\u2019m thinking that SHIELD is going to send some of us off to take care of that in a few days. Not that the \u201cus\u201d ever really includes me.\u201d He pouted, but it didn\u2019t look even remotely genuine since he still had half a slice of pizza hanging out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, babe. Just give it some time\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade waved the words away like they were spelled out in the air in front of him and could be scattered by a light breeze. \u201cI know, I know. Give them time to learn that I\u2019m a totally awesome guy and that they\u2019ve been missing out. I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave him an indulgent smile. \u201cWell, yes. Not the words I would have used\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know what words you would have used.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014but the meaning is the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade harrumphed, and stole a chunk of pineapple off of a slice on Peter\u2019s plate.</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat did you escape just now? I know they usually throw something at you right at lunch, what is it today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade grimaced. \u201cMore paperwork, can you believe it? And I was actually reading some of it today, because I was getting bored of just sitting there, and would you believe it is the exact same stuff that they had given me last week?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cThey\u2019re giving you copies of paperwork you already got?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade nodded, and then looked around like he was about to say something scandalous. Peter leaned in close. \u201cI know, it\u2019s awful rude of them. Especially since I put so much effort into burning the originals to ashes and hiding the ashes in the accountant\u2019s refrigerator.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snorted and threw himself back into his seat. \u201cI know we\u2019ve had this conversation before, but if you just <em>did</em> your work, there would be less work to <em>do</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade rolled his eyes and stuck two slices into his mouth at once.</p>\n<p>Peter quirked an eyebrow. \u201cWhy are you eating so fast, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>It turned out the Wade actually <em>did</em> have work to do, like actual work that he should have already started, so they stuffed their faces pretty quickly, and Peter made it back to the lab before his break had ended.</p>\n<p>(Not that they\u2019d mind if he was late. A few times he\u2019d even come into work late after accidentally sleeping in post a really long Spidey patrol night, and Tony had greeted him like nothing. Bruce had smiled, made a quick quip, but then dropped it immediately. He\u2019d tried to stay late to make up the time, but Tony had just laughed and waved him off. \u201cGrowing boys need their beauty sleep. I\u2019m not going to punish you for your biology.\u201d). </p>\n<p>Walking into the lab, seeing Bruce and Tony tinkering away, with Natasha in the corner painting her nails with a bowie knife clenched between her teeth, Peter smiled. He\u2019d just won this round. Or maybe he\u2019d leveled up. (He wasn\u2019t sure what type of game this was. Were there levels? A point system? Was it going to get harder as the game progressed?)</p>\n<p>(The answer was yes.)</p>\n<p>If Peter was going to play this game well, he decided, than the best plan of action was to not make anyone suspicious. So, the next day, when Bruce invited him to eat with Steve and Black Widow, Peter agreed readily.</p>\n<p>Black Widow was already seated when they arrived, typing something lengthy on her phone, but Steve was still in the kitchen cooking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a-cooking, good-looking?\u201d Peter asked as he pulled out a chair and slid into it.</p>\n<p>Black Widow glanced up. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d she asked in a scathing tone.</p>\n<p>Peter immediately straightened in his seat and gulped. \u201cUh, no ma\u2019am. Nuh-uh.\u201d He pointed over towards where Steve was frying something up on the stove. \u201cNo, I was talking to Captain Rogers, uh, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce took a seat next to Peter and stuck his tongue out at Black Widow. \u201cLay off those jokes around the kid. He hasn\u2019t caught on to your sense of humor yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head solemnly. \u201cAnd I never will, nuh-uh, no way in hell, um, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve walked in then, carrying four plates which he set down in front of everyone else before serving himself. \u201cPeter, did I hear you call me good looking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded absent-mindedly, too busy admiring the salmon and asparagus.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a common phrase, rhyming cooking and looking,\u201d Bruce said in the same serious tone of voice that he used whenever he really, really, wanted to be laughing. </p>\n<p>Peter did not trust that tone of voice, no he did not. It was always used before Tony said something hilarious at Peter\u2019s expense, or after Peter said something that was about to blow up in his face. He tore his eyes away from the delicious looking food only to look up and see that Steve was flushed a magnificent shade of red.</p>\n<p>Peter only barely kept from laughing himself. \u201cHas no one told you you were good looking?\u201d He clucked disappointedly and made little pinching motions in the direction of Steve\u2019s cheeks. \u201cPoor boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even Black Widow looked like she was holding back laughter, and since he\u2019d once seen her stare ahead with a completely neutral expression on her face through the entirety of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Peter knew that this was serious business.</p>\n<p>Steve opened his mouth, but no sound came out. He gulped, and tried what sounded like it might have been, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d but it came out more like a squeak, and then his mouth snapped shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cI lied,\u201d Black Widow said suddenly, \u201cI like this one. <em>I\u2019m</em> keeping him.\u201d Then she turned abruptly in her seat and stuck out her hand for Peter to shake, which he did hesitantly. \u201cHello, my name is Natasha, nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Peter gasped out, and then finally Bruce couldn\u2019t take it anymore and he began laughing hysterically, his hand clamped over his mouth though it did nothing to muffle his mirth. And then Natasha (First name basis with the Widow! Score!) started laughing too, more refined than Bruce but still genuinely happy. And then Steve and Peter looked at each other, saw the confusion and amusement in each other\u2019s faces and began laughing at the same time.</p>\n<p>Peter clutched at his side as the hilarity rocked through him, and only after a long interval of stop-and-go giggling did the laughter finally die out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you guys,\u201d Peter said, his voice still a little breathier than it should be, and his cheeks smarting from laughing so hard. And then he breathed out a quick sigh and finally tucked into lunch, only to immediately swear and say, \u201cNever mind, screw you guys. I love this food!\u201d He took another bite of the salmon. \u201cYep, definitely divorcing the Avengers and running away to elope with this fish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gave a short bark of laughter. \u201cNope. You are not allowed to divorce us. Uh, I mean, at least <em>I</em> was the one to make the food, so how can you have it without me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded, like a student would after hearing his teacher spout something deep and philosophical. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Steve, will you marry me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce pointed at Peter\u2019s ring finger with his fork. \u201cI think you might already have someone for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked at his engagement ring (ENGAGEMENT RING!!!) with a moue of fake disgust. \u201cAre you kidding me? My fiance can\u2019t cook worth crap! I\u2019ve got to do all the cooking in the house. I mean, at least I make him do the cleaning up, but still, slaving over a hot stove for a man who can\u2019t even boil water?\u201d </p>\n<p>He tsked to himself, though that was not necessarily true. Wade could boil water just fine. He was a functioning adult fully capable of working all of the appliances in the kitchen with the same efficiency as he used his Uzi or his hand grenades. It was what he chose to <em>create</em> that had Peter running for the hills. Macaroni and Jellyfish. Calamari and sriracha . Hamburger a la cookie dough ice cream. Really horrifying stuff.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you do all the cooking stuff?\u201d Natasha asked, spearing an asparagus stalk and biting into it gracefully. (Can you bite into an asparagus stalk gracefully? How? Peter wanted to know, because he was pretty sure he\u2019d just seen an assassin do it, but was too scared to ask.)</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t <em>really</em> mind it though. I like throwing things together and coming back with a delicious and enjoyable meal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Steve said, and then admitted in a more sedate tone of voice, \u201cand it\u2019s good for calming me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter agreed, \u201cAnd my food isn\u2019t half-bad, not as good as Steve\u2019s but not bad. My baking though,\u201d he whistled, \u201cI have an apple pie that would knock the socks right off of your feet, screw the shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve raised his eyebrows, and his eyes shone with something that resembled competitive gleam. \u201cOh yeah? Well I\u2019ll have you know that <em>I</em> can make a pretty mean apple pie myself. And my recipe uses all fresh ingredients. None of that pre-made pie-crust, or apple filling from a can that seem so popular nowadays.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter swallowed the piece of salmon in his mouth and set down his fork on the table with a quiet <em>chink</em> of metal on metal before crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI am offended, my good Captain. I\u2019ll have you know that my apple pie was taught to me by my Aunt May, the dearest of women, and a stickler for making pastries from scratch. I have never even <em>touched</em> a pre-made pie crust. Canned apple filling? Hah! Only good for children and the weak!\u201d Peter narrowed his eyes. \u201cIn fact, during apple season, we drive upstate to Warwick to pick our own damn apples to use as filing. What do you think of <em>them</em> apples?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that, yeah, fresh apples are important, but I\u2019ve got something you don\u2019t have, Mr. Parker. I\u2019ve got history on my side. I\u2019m sure your apple pie is alright, but was it made to help keep you warm when the depression started to seep into your bones? Make you smile when all around you are sad, dirty faces?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stuck up his nose and gave a little sniff. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it then, this all-american, soul-warming, Captain-America-approved apple pie.\u201d Steve paused a moment to think, but Peter didn\u2019t let him. \u201cWhat? You think maybe I\u2019m right? Were you bluffing, Mr. High-and-mighty? Huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve set his shoulders and straightened his spine and started detailing how the famous pie was made. Yeah, yeah, slice the apples thin, add cinnamon crumble top, it was all stuff that sounded nothing more than ordinary to Peter, but the more Steve talked the more it sounded both absolutely scrumptious and also really, really, familiar. By the end of Steve\u2019s spiel, Bruce looked like his mouth was watering, Natasha was making really subtle grabby motions with her hands, and Peter was sitting with his mouth gaping open.</p>\n<p>Steve smirked at Peter\u2019s dumbfounded expression. \u201cNot feeling so hot now, huh, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>my</em> recipe!\u201d Peter exclaimed, and yes, he could admit in his own head that he sounded like a petulant child who had just lost a contest, but that was <em>his</em> recipe, the one Aunt May had taught him and made for him a bazillion times.</p>\n<p>Bruce actually looked genuinely disappointed in Peter when he said, \u201cNow Peter, just because you can\u2019t trump Steve doesn\u2019t mean you have to go and be such a sore loser.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave the scientist an unimpressed look. \u201cBut it <em>is</em> my recipe, or my Aunt May\u2019s recipe.\u201d Peter rounded on Steve who was giving his own unimpressed look, but Peter was not about to be waylaid about this. He\u2019d been helping his aunt make that recipe since he was seven, and had been eating it for much longer, he knew what he was talking about.</p>\n<p>Natasha seemed to agree with him, surprisingly (and suspiciously) enough, and said, \u201cWell can you prove it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter paused, thinking. It wasn\u2019t like he could just call up Aunt May. They might think she\u2019d side with him over anything just \u2018cause she was his aunt (which she would totally not do at all. Help him out? Yes. Lie for him? No sir-ee!). And it wasn\u2019t like he could describe something else about the pie, Steve had gone into enough details. And it was the same pie. The directions were the same, and Steve had sounded like he was reciting them verbatim from the same scrap of paper that Aunt May had tucked away in her old cook book, pressed between the unused pages detailing how to make jellied pork and tomato soup spice cake. Not like that scrap had been seen in years. Aunt May had never needed it when she made the pie, and had only shown it to Peter the few times he\u2019d helped before he too had memorized it. It was one of those family trade secret things. In fact it hadn\u2019t even been touched since before Peter hit double digits. It was really impressive that Steve knew it all, he\u2019d even left out the bit about the crumble top that Aunt May had always warned against telling anyone about. She\u2019d said, yes, you can try to impress a girl or a next door neighbor with the pie, even write down for them the recipe, but leave out that extra cinnamon/vanilla/nutmeg crumble top because that\u2019s what keeps them coming back for more. And just like Aunt May had always told Peter, Steve had left out that extra step.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s head shot up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve quirked an eyebrow. \u201cReally now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded and rose from the table. Yes, he could prove that the pie was his, but the secret was still a secret. He hunched over Steve\u2019s shoulder (and Steve tensed subconsciously) and whispered in his ear the step he\u2019d left out. And then because Peter could be a melodramatic bastard when he wanted, he calmly sat back in his seat and smiled innocently at the people around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cVerdict?\u201d Natasha asked.</p>\n<p>Steve gulped and gave Peter a searching look. \u201cHe\u2019s right. He knows it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Bruce asked.</p>\n<p>Steve ignored his question to ask his own. \u201cPeter, how could you possibly know that recipe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged. \u201cMy Aunt always said it was a family secret. She learned it from her mom who learned it from a family friend who learned it from her mom. Of course that was back when Aunt May was growing up and she lived in Brooklyn back then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho lived in Brooklyn?\u201d came a voice from the hall and in walked Tony Stark carrying a broken sewing machine and a plate of orange jello. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d Bruce started to ask, pointing at the plate and the machine before cutting himself off and saying, \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Aunt May grew up in Brooklyn, her parents lived there, and their parents, for generations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony pointed at Steve with his chin. \u201cKind of like Capsicle here, except Cap spent a lot of those generations in ice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes at Tony. \u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to say is I\u2019m old as dirt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tony exclaims, and almost dropped the jello. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to say for forever! You\u2019re a dinosaur, man! A fossil!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve turned to Peter, ignoring the mechanically inclined man-child. \u201cMaybe your family got it from my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr your family got it from mine.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve nodded, and a note of exasperation leaked out as he said, \u201cYes. Either way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony trudged over and slammed both the sewing machine and the plate of jello down on a section of unused table. \u201cWell enough about whatever you were talking about, who wants to try some of this very safe and not at all experimental jello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye,\u201d Natasha said and ran away so quickly that Peter could barely hear her as she dashed out the door. </p>\n<p>\u201cSee you guys later,\u201d Steve said, only fractionally slower than Natasha and also made a run for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta jet!\u201d Bruce exclaimed, looking at where a watch would be sitting on his wrist if he had been wearing one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho says that anymore?\u201d Tony exclaimed at Bruce\u2019s back as Peter tried to subtly sneak away. \u201cWhat about you, Pete? Do you want some dessert?\u201d He gestured at the ominous fluorescent orange and Peter shook his head violently.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, uh, no thanks. Some other time, maybe. I\u2019ve got to, ah, get back to work. See you later Tony?\u201d And before Tony could answer, Peter too was out the door.</p>\n<p>Tony sighed and sat himself in the chair in front of the sewing machine. \u201cOh well,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cmore for me I guess,\u201d and popped a chunk of jello into his mouth.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s next move was to eat a really delicious hot dog with Wade at lunch the next day.</p>\n<p>It was good strategy, by Peter\u2019s way of thinking, because it killed three-ish birds with one hot dog, and that was good math (and Peter was a Maths and Science sort of guy, so you could trust him on that). The three-ish birds were: 1) he got to eat lunch, always a plus, 2) he got to see Wade and kiss him a little and look into his eyes and discuss what dinosaurs would <em>actually</em> have looked like because a new article came out saying that bright feathers were probably a thing and Wade really liked that idea (and so did Peter, but shhhhhh, because he liked playing devil\u2019s advocate to make Wade ramble faster), and 3) Peter earned more points.</p>\n<p>Cause this was definitely a game.</p>\n<p>And he was <em>winning!</em></p>\n<p>The \u2013ish was because Peter still wasn\u2019t sure what sort of game this was, and if there even <em>was</em> a points system, or if it was just see-how-long-you-can-last, or if he could get to the next level.</p>\n<p>But it didn\u2019t matter because Peter is still <em>winning</em>, and he even got back to work on time, and after a short patrol as Spidey where absolutely nothing happened (what the fuck is wrong with this town? Villains used to be so reliable...), Peter could go back home and curl into Wade on the couch and nibble on chips while he tried to beat the shit out of his boyfriend in Tekken. </p>\n<p>He lost.</p>\n<p>392 times in a row.</p>\n<p>That was ok. </p>\n<p>And Peter was ok. More than ok, he was happy.</p>\n<p>And it was ok if he wasn\u2019t winning all of the games.</p>\n<p>But the next day, when Peter served his court-ordered stint with the Avengers for lunch, he thought that maybe he hadn\u2019t read all of the rules for this game after all. When Bruce and Peter and Tony (too. It\u2019s kind of a nice surprise because more often than not, Tony just completely forgot to stop to eat, or sleep, or do anything but work crazy hours) stepped off the elevator and into the Avenger\u2019s common room floor, there, sitting at the table between super spy Natasha Romanoff and super spy Clint Barton was none other than Wade Wilson, mercenary and boyfriend extraordinaire. </p>\n<p>The three standing paused and stare dat the three sitting and Peter blinked.</p>\n<p>Wade did this weird arm waggle thing that he always did when what he wanted to do was jump up and scamper about and possibly kiss the living daylights out of Peter, but he was being forcibly held to his seat by either really good ropes or the glare of a Russian ex-assassin, and said, \u201cHola, mis tres amigos. Estoy caliente.\u201d </p>\n<p>Bruce shuddered, and Peter didn\u2019t know if that meant he was the only one who understood Spanish or if the others were just better at remaining completely neutral in the face of all things pertaining to both this mercenary and to sex. Peter only knew that Wade had just said he was horny because he said it often enough in the comfort of their own home. And, all over the city, actually. Everywhere and whenever he wanted. </p>\n<p>Clint cleared his throat a little self-consciously and said, \u201cWe hope you don\u2019t mind. Wade is, reluctantly, one of us now, and leaving him out of Avengers lunches was starting to seem a little rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha looked like she wouldn\u2019t mind continuing to be a little rude.</p>\n<p>Peter gave Clint a grateful smile, because it was nice that they were trying to accept Wade. It had made Peter feel kind of weird when he\u2019d realized that these guys were spending more time with him, a cocky intern half their age, than their own teammate, no matter what his status was. </p>\n<p>He\u2019d talked to Wade about it, but Wade didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. \u201cYou\u2019re Spiderman! Of course they\u2019re going to love your more.\u201d He hadn\u2019t sounded upset at all, even a bit proud of Peter\u2019s \u201caccomplishment.\u201d The accomplishment being, of course, that he was a good guy superhero, and that he had been for five-ish years.</p>\n<p>Peter had shaken his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that though. To them, I\u2019m just some kid who does science stuff with Tony and Bruce.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shrugged. \u201cBabe, it\u2019s fine. I see them a lot too. More than you do. Don\u2019t feel bad about taking away my fun times with them because frankly, I see them, it seems all the fucking hours of the day and night. Honestly, Pookie.\u201d</p>\n<p>But now that they were all about to eat together, even if Wade was practically being held prisoner on the opposite side of the table, Peter could feel a knot of guilt that he hadn\u2019t even realized had been pressing into his stomach loosen. </p>\n<p>Peter pulled out a chair even as Bruce and Tony hesitated, and sprawled himself comfortably at the table. \u201cSo, what\u2019s for lunch today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony jostled Peter\u2019s shoulder playfully as he took a seat next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, bozo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter straightened a little. \u201cMy turn?\u201d He eyed the kitchen and tried to think up something he could make on such short notice.</p>\n<p>Natasha didn\u2019t roll her eyes, but her head did this little twist thing that made her hair flip and gave the distinct impression that she was rolling her eyes when she wasn\u2019t. (Peter had to learn how to do that!) \u201cJesus, kid, calm yourself. Stark is just pulling your leg. Thor will be back with Chinese take-out in a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade whistled. \u201cYou trusted demi-god to get the food? He\u2019s got no grasp of societal anything! What if he winds up in an arranged marriage to the Dalai Lama or something! That\u2019s not something you can back out from.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce gave this big frown that reminded Peter almost hysterically of a stuffed toy bear he\u2019d had as a child. \u201cThor is perfectly capable of getting us lunch, Deadpool. He isn\u2019t incompetent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike some people,\u201d Tony muttered beneath his breath, and Peter wouldn\u2019t have caught it except for his extra hearing abilities. </p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s shoulders straightened, because no, they were not going to pick on his boyfriend without him standing up for Wade. \u201cI think W-Deadpool was just joking. Weren\u2019t you?\u201d He gave a tiny nod to Wade and Wade relaxed just a fraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, totally. I love Mr. Thunder! He\u2019s the greatest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Peter said, and looked into the grumpy face of Tony.</p>\n<p>Wade waggled his eyebrows from beneath his mask, and said in his most come-hither-to-my-bed-chamber-and-bring-the-doritos voice, \u201cThank you Pete, I don\u2019t know what I would have done without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t even blush, because this was nothing more than the usual. \u201cNo prob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI regret this,\u201d Natasha moaned, and Peter at least had to give her props for not trying to hide her utter annoyance with his boyfriend\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p>(not an unusual state to be in)</p>\n<p>Then one of the windows flew open, answering two of Peter\u2019s questions, the first being if any of the windows could be opened in order to gain entry or exit from the building (which was a resounding yes), and the second being when would the food arrive (now).</p>\n<p>Thor landed on the marble floor with a great crash of thunder and dropped two brown paper sacks onto the table. \u201cI have arrived with the preparations for the feast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d Wade belted out from his seat and tried to stand, but a glare from Natasha had him lowering himself back into his chair.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t miss the glint of amusement in Thor\u2019s eyes however as he stalked to the kitchen to get plates.</p>\n<p>Peter took a look in the bags and whistled. \u201cYou sure did get a lot of food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor set the plates down and Natasha began unloading one of the bags, motioning that Peter should do the same. It was Tony who spoke. \u201cLot of mouths to feed, lot of demi-gods and super humans to nourish.\u201d He shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Steve is coming too?\u201d And just then the elevator dinged and Steve walked out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about being so late, guys. Got caught up talking to Sam.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you invite him?\u201d Asked Natasha as she opened a carton of sesame chicken and dumped most of it onto her plate.</p>\n<p>Steve shrugged. \u201cI did, but he had plans. Personally, I think he has a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, do tell!\u201d Tony commanded in the worst falsetto Peter had ever heard.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave the poor boy alone, Martha,\u201d Peter demanded, trying to sound like an old man and probably failing horribly, \u201cIt is none of your business whether young Samuel wants to take someone out or not.\u201d He puffed on an imaginary pipe.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Papa!\u201d Wade exclaimed in his own, much more practiced, falsetto, and tilted his head onto his folded hands in much the same way a cartoon damsel would. \u201cI wanted Samuel to ask me on a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head and mimed relighting his pipe. \u201cWhat is done is done, dear. Samuel obviously found someone who is more attractive, funnier, and better in bed, Maribel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade gasped melodramatically and swooned, first towards Natasha, but he thought better of it, and found himself lounging on Clint, waving a hand in front of his face and saying, \u201cWell I do believe I\u2019ve got the vapors.\u201d Clint was not happy about being used as a fainting couch, and jabbed Wade in the side with a chopstick, which made the masked man yelp and jump back into his own seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cBravo!\u201d Bruce said mockingly and clapped. Peter and Wade bowed in sync, and then Peter pulled at Tony\u2019s collar so that he was bowing too. </p>\n<p>Steve Sat between Bruce and Clint, and Thor between Tony and Natasha, and then there was a short lull in the conversation as everyone\u2019s arms flurried out to serve food and pass out plates and utensils.</p>\n<p>Then Peter was settled in with a plate of lo mein and a pair of chopsticks and he relaxed into a sprawl in his seat once more. Tony tried to reach across Peter to snag a spring roll off of Bruce\u2019s plate, but Thor on the other side of Tony pulled him back with a tug on his sleeve. \u201cThis is very family,\u201d Wade said around a mouthful of broccoli and beef. His mask was pulled up to his nose, and he looked a little tense around the shoulders, but he wasn\u2019t actively trying to hide the scars on the bottom half of his face, and that made Peter smile a little. He was starting to trust more, and that was good, especially around his teammates. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, if anyone even dared to <em>mention</em> his scars or newly shown trust, Peter would slap them so hard their teeth would fall out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony asked, and raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>Wade nodded emphatically. \u201cLook at us. The Avengers. All eating lunch together. One big family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter swallowed before asking, \u201cWell what does that make me? The awkward distant relative?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Baby-boy, I haven\u2019t forgotten you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should,\u201d Natasha muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I want to hear this,\u201d Steve said, \u201cbecause I will not tolerate anything mean, do you hear me? You promised to be on your best behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis <em>is</em> his best behavior,\u201d Clint said with a little smirk, but then he jostled Wade good-naturedly and Peter relaxed farther into his seat. At least Hawkeye was being nice to Wade, even if that niceness translated into teasing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo I got it!\u201d Wade exclaimed, \u201cWe are all one big family, correcto-mundo? \u2018Cause we\u2019re all superheroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> any super powers,\u201d Bruce explained slowly, as if to a small, slightly annoying child.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly! That\u2019s why he\u2019s the awkward cousin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor looked between Bruce and Wade. \u201cHave we all become kin? Are we more, now, than mere blood brothers of battle, but brothers and sisters in actual blood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an analogy,\u201d Natasha explained to Thor, at the same time that Wade continued, \u201cA really <em>sexy</em> cousin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEw!\u201d Clint said, and flicked a piece of carrot at Wade\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head sagely, and said \u201cNo kissing cousins.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shuddered, and Tony tried once more to snag a spring roll from his plate. This time he succeeded.</p>\n<p>Natasha gave Wade a dirty look, but continued to speak to Thor. \u201cHe means that we are all close as if we were family. Still blood brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh good,\u201d the Norse god exclaimed, a smile settling onto his face, \u201cI have enough troubles within my kin, I would hate to add that to anyone else\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYOU ARE DISOWNED!\u201d Wade yelled, jumping to his feet and pointing his chopsticks at Peter. And then he simpered, \u201cCan we kiss now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Steve said in his Captain America voice and Wade slumped back into his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, Daaaad!!!\u201d Peter whined, and when Steve shot him a shocked look, Peter gave him his very best unimpressed eyebrow-raise.</p>\n<p>Then he mentally berated himself, because he wanted to win this game fair and square, and that meant not giving the enemy any hints.</p>\n<p>But it all worked out fine, because Tony had taken his words as jest and said, \u201cI thought you were his cousin? How can you be our cousin, and then have Steve be your dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scratched his head. \u201cI thought I was just W\u2014Deadpool\u2019s cousin? I figured Natasha and Clint were his parents, because, well,\u201d he gestured towards where Natasha and Clint were effectively boxing Wade in and watching his every move, just like real parents taking care of a toddler. \u201cAnd then I figured, if Wade got cool spy parents, I should get to keep Steve as <em>my</em> father.\u201d He paused a moment, and then looked over at Bruce with a pondering look on his face. \u201cYou can be my mother if you want, Bruce.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shrugged good-naturedly. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that make <em>me</em>?\u201d Tony said, and then snorted. \u201cYour kooky Uncle or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s flinch was so minute that no one could have noticed it, but then Wade was talking, overruling Tony, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but smile at his awesome boyfriend. Wade knew that the ache over Uncle Ben\u2019s death was still fresh, even all of these years later, and he was kind of protective over Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like crazy, mad scientist grandpa if you ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gawked at the mercenary. \u201cI\u2019m not old enough to be a grandpa! If anything it should be Capsicle over there. He\u2019s ninety plus!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ice doesn\u2019t count!\u201d Steve said in a very affronted tone, and when Thor gave him a patronizing smile, Steve responded by looking away and huffing.</p>\n<p>But Tony was warming up to the subject, and he rubbed his hands together, forgetting about the food still left on his plate. \u201cNo, Steve can be Grandpa Cap, and he can ramble to young Peter all about when he fought the Nazis back in his hay-day. And I can be dear old dad. Hey, I can teach you anything you need to know Peter, right? I\u2019d be a much better dad! We share mechanics! And science! And Brucie-bear would much rather be married to little ol\u2019 me than goody two shoes over there, right dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looked at Tony and slowly bit down on the last spring roll on his plate.</p>\n<p>Tony cleared his throat. \u201cOk then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not <em>ramble</em>,\u201d Steve said, somehow managing to sound both menacing and as if he was trying to convince himself of that fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere does that leave me, comrades?\u201d Thor asked with a hint of amusement, and Peter was suddenly reminded that Thor was a practically immortal god who had probably lived for hundreds if not thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s head whipped over to where Thor was calmly devouring three whole containers of kung pao chicken. \u201cI claim him! Thor can be my brother, can\u2019t you oh blond and mysterious one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor gave him a look that Peter chose to interpret as \u2018I already have one homicidal, murderous brother, that is enough,\u2019 but then he smiled softly and said, \u201cI would be most honored to call you brother, oh Water of Death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snorted at the nickname, but Wade fucking beamed at Thor like he\u2019d hung the moon. Peter sent out a silent thanks, because he knew how much it meant to Wade that the Avengers like him.</p>\n<p>Things kind of settled down then, because Wade was too ecstatic about what Thor had said that for once he actually shut up. Well, that wasn\u2019t quite true, but his murmurs and whatever he was saying to the voices in his head was said so quietly that even Peter couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying, but his smile didn\u2019t diminish.</p>\n<p>By the time the end of lunch hour rolled around and Peter returned to work, he wasn\u2019t sure if this lunch counted as him leveling up, or just completing a side quest, but he was happy either way.</p>\n<p>Wade was getting included in things, <em>and</em> he\u2019d get to hang out with his fianc\u00e9 more often.</p>\n<p>This belief was upheld when the next day at lunch Wade was in attendance, even when it was just the two of them, Natasha and Pepper. Natasha, it turns out, could make a mean Potato salad, and Peter had brought in sloppy joes, so lunch itself was great, and so was the company.</p>\n<p>And now Peter couldn\u2019t wait to get to lunch every day, because the Avengers were just so nice to be around, and Wade was right, it <em>was</em> like a big family, everyone was so comfortable around each other, even Wade and Peter who were fairly new additions to the family.</p>\n<p>Peter could not have been happier, having found this group of people who genuinely seemed to like him, him as nerdy Peter Parker, and also accepted Wade. And the only awkward moment was when, sometime in the next week, Bruce asked why Peter wasn\u2019t eating lunch with his fianc\u00e9 anymore.</p>\n<p>Peter had shrugged. \u201cI have alone time with him after work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce had given him this searching look, but Peter didn\u2019t know what else he could say without giving the whole game away, and he couldn\u2019t do that, he was <em>winning</em>.</p>\n<p>The next few days when Peter caught Bruce scrutinizing Peter\u2019s interactions with Wade it gave Peter the funniest feeling in his stomach, a feeling he couldn\u2019t really recognize until that night found him curled into Wade\u2019s side, smashing the mercenary ruthlessly in Super Smash Brothers.</p>\n<p>The realization was so startling that Peter missed a hit from Kirby of all people (or not-people) and he dropped off a floating rock bridge, costing him a life.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck, Petey-pie?\u201d Wade said as he paused the game, but then when he looked down and saw that Peter was openly gaping, looking into the middle distance, his tone became more concerned. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Pete?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey think I\u2019m flirting with you!\u201d Peter gasped out.</p>\n<p>Wade didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, probably hoping that Peter would explain. When Peter did no such thing, Wade spoke. \u201cYeeeaaaah?\u201d He dragged the word out, as if hoping that Peter really would explain what he was on about, but still Peter said nothing. \u201cYou do though. You flirt with me. I flirt with you. It isn\u2019t a big deal, \u2018cause, I don\u2019t know if you remember, but we are not only dating, but engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter couldn\u2019t help the snort of almost hysterical laughter that shot out of him. \u201cYeah, but I mean, the Avengers. They think I\u2019m flirting with Deadpool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade nodded slowly, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m still not seeing the problem here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cThe Avengers, think I\u2019m flirting with Deadpool. They see us flirting, and they think that I like Deadpool. <em>Like</em> like Deadpool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Petey, you\u2019re gonna hafta be me more explicit. I honestly don\u2019t know what you\u2019re rattling on about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Peter shot to his feet and started pacing across the room. </p>\n<p>\u201cPete! Just say it slowly for me, ok? I\u2019m not that smart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter paused and his head whipped around. He finally examined his boyfriend, and saw that Wade really looked frustrated. He was squeezing the controller he still held in his hands and was biting his lips, pulling at the soft red skin with his teeth, avoiding eye contact, and Peter almost winced.</p>\n<p>Wade rubbed his face. \u201cSpell it out for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a self-deprecating smile and moved over to sit in Wade\u2019s lap. He kissed Wade\u2019s head and skimmed a finger over a puckered scar that ran straight from his right temple down to the corner of his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re plenty smart. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not making much sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s lips spread into an indulgent smile, and Peter kissed the corner of Wade\u2019s mouth. Then he sat farther away from Wade, while still lounging in his lap, to better look at him. Wade looked gorgeous, with that expression of Peter-get-on-with-it mixed with Peter-I-Love-YOU.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, let me try again. The Avengers, or at least Steve and Bruce, and maybe Natasha (I can never tell with her) know that you and me flirt heavily. I\u2019m afraid to say that we\u2019ve been making it pretty obvious.\u201d Wade nodded because, yes, they had been. \u201cThey aren\u2019t dumb, they must see how much I love you. Because I do love you. Idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, well, so to them, Peter Parker, normal dorky intern, is flirting with Deadpool, Merc with a Mouth, dangerous guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? We <em>are</em> dating.\u201d Wade stuck out his lower lip in a pout.</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes. \u201cBut <em>they</em> don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOooohhh.\u201d Then he gave a very very lewd smile and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cSo they\u2019re worried that mean old mercenary is going to corrupt wittle baby intern Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave a huff but nodded, dimpling a smile. \u201cYes, but there\u2019s more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat more could there be? Isn\u2019t that drama enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded exuberantly.\u201cYes! Exactly! It\u2019s already enough drama as it is, but! They <em>also</em> know that I\u2019m engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gave his fianc\u00e9 an exasperated look. \u201cDuh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d they find out?\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes and held out his left hand where his engagement ring (ENGAGEMENT RING!!!) glinted even in the semi darkness of their apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, oh. Plus, and I don\u2019t know if you remember this, but I\u2019m kind of really really in love with you, and I also kind of talk about you all the freaking time.\u201d Wade\u2019s eyes were impossibly wide, Peter couldn\u2019t help but bump noses with the guy. \u201cI love you, dude. We\u2019re like, getting married or whatever. The day after you proposed I honestly couldn\u2019t stop talking about you. All day. Ask Tony. He was begging Dummy to knock him out so he wouldn\u2019t have to listen to me wax poetic about my boyfriend anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could kill him? If you want? For disrespecting you?\u201d Wade sounded kind of not all there, as if he was too busy processing what Peter had said to concentrate on his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, babe, it\u2019s fine. He was joking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wade said weakly, \u201cgood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes, and then suctioned his mouth around Wade\u2019s which did what Peter wanted and brought Wade right back into the present. Quickly. And with tongue.</p>\n<p>Peter pulled away when he decided that he really couldn\u2019t go any longer without oxygen, and that left time for Wade to digest everything that Peter had been saying, and then a new glint entered his eyes. \u201cWait, so not only do they see you flirting with lil\u2019 ol\u2019 me, but they also know you\u2019ve got a boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded, seeing that Wade was getting it. \u201cWho they think is not you. And today Bruce asked me why I don\u2019t go out to lunch with my fianc\u00e9 anymore.\u201d He huffed. \u201cI mean, from their point of view, adding two and two together means\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re cheating on me with me!\u201d Wade giggled hysterically and wrapped his hands around Peter\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>Peter snorted. \u201cYeah. They think I\u2019m cheating on my fianc\u00e9 with my fianc\u00e9.\u201d He swallowed and gave a small grimace. \u201cHow is this even my life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it <em>isn\u2019t</em> your life.\u201d Wade said cryptically, and then, \u201cBut they haven\u2019t confronted you about it yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird.\u201d Wade intoned, and then shrugged flippantly. \u201cIt\u2019ll work itself out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes, but cuddled in closer to Wade. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow are we going to get back to this game or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked at the clock hanging crookedly on the wall above the entrance to the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty late, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thinking about going on patrol?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cWanna come?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade jumped to his feet, jostling Peter onto the ground, and rushed around gathering the various parts of his costume (weapons to spandex) that were strewn across the living room. \u201cOf course, </p>\n<p>Peter dressed quickly in their bedroom, grabbing his suit and web shooters from out of the box stuffed in the back of the underwear drawer of his dresser, and by the time he was back in the living room, Wade was dressed and ready to go, and also juggling a glock, an uzi, and a bowie knife in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cSexy,\u201d Peter said drily, and Wade gave Peter a giant grin from behind his mask before catching the three items and reholstering them in their assigned positions. </p>\n<p>Peter let Wade climb onto his back, spider-monkey style (Thank you, twilight movie, for using that term. Now it\u2019s stuck here forever.) and then opened the window of their apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade tightened his grip on Peter\u2019s torso and licked a long stripe down the back of Peter\u2019s spandex-covered neck, which made the younger man shudder. \u201cFor anything, hunny-bun, and always for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter jumped.</p>\n<p>The first hint that the day was going to be a weird one was that when Peter first walked into the lab, it was empty. This hardly ever happened. Tony usually greeted him with an absent minded wave, or most notably, once with a wrench thrown at his head (an accident, hopefully) and Bruce might have been at his desk, typing away at his computer with one hand while the other clutched possessively at a mug of tea. Yes, the two Avengers were sometimes absent, but even then Clint or Steve would show up to keep him company. Today everything was silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d Peter asked, addressing the security camera in the corner of the ceiling.</p>\n<p>It was not nearly as weird learning to interact with the sentient artificial intelligence as he\u2019d thought it might be. Jarvis was a creation of Tony\u2019s just like Dummy or You, only bodiless and much, much smarter (than Peter). It was like talking to a secret man in the wiring, which it actually was. Jarvis was just a secret man in the wiring. Not really weird considering that Peter had once fought a giant lizard-man, and another guy made entirely of electricity, and a guy with four metal arms attached to his torso, or a man who\u2019s favorite style was to dress all in green armor and ride around on a hovering metal surfboard-thing. No, Jarvis was not the weirdest person Peter had met, but he was one of the nicest. Plus, Jarvis actually liked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mr. Parker?\u201d came the cool British tones of the AI.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir and the Avengers were called away last night to DC. There was an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowned. He distinctly remembered sleeping with Wade last night, and then waking up next to him, and then kissing him before heading off to work. Wade was <em>definitely</em> not in DC.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, W\u2014uh Deadpool is still here.\u201d For a brief moment Peter panicked, thinking that he had just given himself away, because how was Peter-the-innocent-intern supposed to know where Deadpool was. But before he could freak out too much, Jarvis was talking again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Mr. Deadpool was left behind to, quoting Sir, \u2018Babysit New York and my fucking house.\u2019 The rest of the Avengers are scheduled to return sometime tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked at the camera and then gave it a wide grin. He liked Jarvis\u2019s sense of humor. Sue him. (No don\u2019t, he had no money!)</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Jarvis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime, Mr. Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed and fished out his phone. \u201c<em>I hear you and me are alone in the tower today. Want to meet up for romantic, candle-lit lunch date?</em>\u201d he sent to Wade in a text.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh yes, hunny-bun! And maybe\u2026office sexy time?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Definitely not.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> :P I hate you. I\u2019ll order pizza.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled at the screen of his phone. He almost texted Wade saying that he was surprised Wade didn\u2019t insist he play hookie all day, but then he realized that Wade would take that as permission to come annoy Peter until he agreed to play hookie all day, and he actually <em>did</em> have work to do. Instead he sent a heart emoticon and stuffed his phone back into his pocket.</p>\n<p>If he checked the time more often than he normally did, that was between Peter and Jarvis.</p>\n<p>A few minutes before lunch Wade stumbled through the doors of the lab, arms piled high with seven pizza boxes and two two-liters of orange soda. \u201cPeter-baby. Ready for a candle lit dinner\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014of fire and sexiness? And pizza?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a pause before Peter asked, \u201cFire?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade raised his eyebrows. \u201cYeah? Cause, I set candles up? Candle lit dinner/lunch? Why have candles if there isn\u2019t going to be immense amounts of fire involved. C\u2019mon Pete! Fire! Arson! The Flames of Hell!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter powered off his computer and grabbed the two-liters from Wade before giving his boyfriend a peck on the lips and leading him to the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I know the others are off doing other things,\u201d Peter said, as the elevator doors slid open and they stepped through, \u201cdoes that mean that we can\u2019t use the Avengers area?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade scowled magnificently. \u201cI\u2019m an Avenger, aren\u2019t I? Let\u2019s do it! J-rod\u2019ll let us in, won\u2019t you, sky-demon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jarvis\u2019s voice, when it came through the speakers in the metal room, held both a hint of amusement and of irritation. \u201cYes sir. Since both you and Mr. Parker have been added to list of persons allowed access to the Avenger\u2019s rooms, I would have no reason to ban you from those rooms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked down at the two-liters. \u201cThanks, Jarvis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime, Mr. Parker,\u201d and talking to Peter, Jarvis sounded a lot more comfortable.</p>\n<p>The doors opened and Peter walked into the dining room, only to see that the dining room table was covered in candles, tea-lights to those thick ones in glass jars to the thin candelabra ones. The windows were darkened and the flickering candles lit the room in cozy, homey tones. Peter huffed out a gust of laughter and dropped the two-liters onto an empty chair. </p>\n<p>\u201cI see that you weren\u2019t joking about the fire thing. Let\u2019s not turn to arson, shall we? I like my job here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade let go of the pizzas and the seven boxes scattered across the floor. Wade shoved his mask off of his face, threw it unceremoniously against the far wall, and with one step, Peter was in Wade\u2019s arms and his mouth was occupied with a very skilled tongue that was thoroughly trying to map out every inch of it. Peter hummed and his eyes fluttered closed.</p>\n<p>Wade\u2019s arms wrapped around his torso and squeezed him close, and Peter pressed closely into his side, trailing his hands up the sides of Wade\u2019s chest, trying to get his fingers under the seams of the spandex suit.</p>\n<p>When Peter pushed at Wade\u2019s chest to break their kiss, he couldn\u2019t help but smile up into his fianc\u00e9\u2019s face, even as his chest heaved from trying to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a room here or something?\u201d Peter asked, still panting slightly.</p>\n<p>Wade nuzzled Peter\u2019s neck, and when he spoke his breath puffed across the almost invisible hairs at the nape of Peter\u2019s neck, making him shiver. \u201cOf course I do, Petey. Do you want to\u2026\u201d there was a pause where Peter could picture Wade waggling his eyebrows, \u201ccheck it out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed and broke away. \u201cOk, let\u2019s just put the food in the fridge\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade whined and dragged Peter back into the cage of Wade\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to go bad, do we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolled his eyes, but when Wade started making his way back towards the elevator, he didn\u2019t try and stop him. The elevator doors opened without them having to summon it, and Peter found himself pressed against the cold metal of the elevator walls, with Wade\u2019s tongue intent, once more, on exploring Peter\u2019s mouth. There was a bar digging uncomfortably into Peter\u2019s back, and the elevator was moving without anyone having said anything to Jarvis or having pressed any buttons, but Peter honestly couldn\u2019t give a damn.</p>\n<p>When the elevator doors opened with a ding, Peter\u2019s lips felt raw and Wade\u2019s face was flushed. Wade led them to the left and through a wooden door into a little suite that Peter couldn\u2019t help but examine. It was beautiful, if a little impersonal. The kitchen was part dining room, with a small table and two chairs set up next to a window. The living room had a thick rug and a big TV with a ps2 set up, of all things. Giant glass windows, like in the Avengers communal room, let in light, which gave the darkly colored room a lighter, airier feel than it probably would feel at night. There was no coffee table, but there was a couch and an armchair made of a material that looked comfortable, but which Peter didn\u2019t really have time to examine, because Wade pulled Peter into the master bedroom and slammed the door closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Peter honestly didn\u2019t look at anything at all then, because Wade had pushed him onto the king-sized bed, and had suctioned his mouth around a particularly sensitive circle of neck which had Peter\u2019s toes twitching, and his hands fluttering around the bed, trying to grab onto a piece of Wade, any piece. He was failing pretty spectacularly at that too, because every time he thought he had a grip on a part of Wade, Peter\u2019s hand just slipped right off since he was mostly still wearing his spandex suit. And then Wade would wiggle around on top of Peter, finding a better place to leave a hickey.</p>\n<p>Peter was feeling pretty good, and he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was probably saying some pretty ridiculous things that he just could not keep track of (his mouth had a life of its own under normal circumstances, right now it was possibly an alien creature, a sentient and highly intelligent life form foreign to this world, fully capable of making its own decisions and uncaring of the consequences it would have on poor Peter). He had somehow got a leg hooked up over Wade\u2019s hip and had one hand gripping the back of Wade\u2019s neck without being able to even think about reigning in his Spidey-strength, and so it was probably good that it was Wade, who could take anything and still come out the other end of it with something witty to say or do. Wade\u2019s witty action in this event was to pull at the lobe of Peter\u2019s ear gently with his teeth, and Peter gasped and tried to force Wade\u2019s face up so Peter could meet Wade\u2019s mouth with his own, when the door to the bedroom slammed open with a gigantic force and in walked the Avengers, still dressed in their singed, and slightly smoking in some cases, fighting outfits.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Steve demanded, and marched to the end of the bed. \u201cWe came home to find pizza scattered everywhere and Deadpool\u2019s mask lying on the floor. We thought something might have happened and came looking. This is not what I expected to find.\u201d Wade pulled his lips from Peter\u2019s jugular reluctantly and Peter blinked a few times, trying to bring reality back into focus. \u201cI repeat,\u201d Steve said, his voice rising, \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade eyed the brightly colored super hero, gave one last lick to Peter\u2019s neck and then sat up with a sigh. He looked at Peter, who had an adorable furrow in his brow, obviously thinking of how to react to this, and then back at Captain America, who had that stern look to his face that he always got when Wade was involved in something (usually something he shouldn\u2019t have done, but really that was up for debate, since Captain America seemed to disapprove of everything Wade did). Then he looked at Iron Man, who was standing next to Captain America, his face mask up and his hands on his hips. \u201cMe and Petey here were about to get it on, actually, so if you could just\u2026\u201d he made shooing motions with his hand towards the door, and when they didn\u2019t move, he lowered his head once more to Peter\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>It was Natasha\u2019s voice that brought Peter completely out of his head, and Wade completely off of Peter. \u201cDeadpool. If I find that you\u2019ve done anything to Peter to lure him into bed with you, you\u2019ll not have anything to use your healing factor <em>on</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked and sat up completely. \u201cCan we not right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The heroes moved further into the room, and Peter could finally see Bruce, the only one who looked concerned. This was possibly because the others had better masks than him, and hopefully not because he was the only one who cared.</p>\n<p>Thor looked confused, but only as if he were missing part of a puzzle, not like he thought Wade was a pedophile/murderer, or Peter was brainwashed or something. (Not that he could have been a pedophile, Peter was 22, thank you.)</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Steve intoned, and his eyes flickered between Peter and Wade, suspicion and confusion coloring his tone.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Peter could barely see Clint leaning against the wall by the door, his arms crossed over his chest, and a self-satisfied smirk on his face. Peter decided to ignore Clint for the time being because he didn\u2019t think he was capable of handling all of the different emotions in front of him, so he stuck to the ones he understood.</p>\n<p>Peter crossed his arms over his chest and said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m so done with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade nodded absent-mindedly and tried to back into Peter\u2019s personal space.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Natasha growled, and Wade reluctantly backed away again.</p>\n<p>Peter should have been embarrassed, he knew that. Usually if someone, this many someones, and someones too who he respected and worked with had found him in such a compromising situation, he would have been blushing redder than a cherry tomato. But now he was just over all of this. He had been <em>winning</em> this game, he\u2019d thought he had the upper hand, but now he was about to get <em>criticized</em>, and <em>lectured</em> about trying to get up to some hanky panky with the guy whose ring he currently had wrapped about his left ring finger, so\u2026</p>\n<p>Yeah, annoyed was stating it lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter?\u201d Bruce asked, sounding both confused, and almost personally offended. It was the same voice Aunt May had used when Peter had come home in sixth grade with a note from his earth science teach saying that she had caught Peter smuggling home electron microscopes in his back pack. Peter hadn\u2019t been able to meet Aunt May\u2019s eyes, and had stuttered all the way through his explanation that he was going to give them back, he just needed to study the dander on the cats that their next door neighbor let roam the neighborhood because they were acting weird and Peter thought there might be chiggers in their fur. </p>\n<p>This time, Peter was not ashamed, just, you know, irritated. \u201cYeah?\u201d Peter sighed.</p>\n<p>Bruce flinched back and Peter immediately felt bad because Bruce was just trying to be helpful. He didn\u2019t know that Peter had nothing to be ashamed of. And Peter had to give Bruce props because he continued on. \u201cPeter, don\u2019t you have a fianc\u00e9? Why are you doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony clucked in faux-pride. \u201cSewing your wild oats?\u201d He then switched to a tone Peter had heard most often coming from the lips of guidance counselors who thought he could be doing something better with his life. \u201cMan, take it from me, significant others do not buy that excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Deadpool do something to you? Poison you or something? Bribery? Blackmail? \u2018Cause I could kill him for you.\u201d Natasha asked, but Peter didn\u2019t think she would buy any of those excuses for a second. She knew there was something more going on. And in fact, off to the side and behind Natasha, Clint was still silent and smirking, with a gleam in his eye that said, \u2018<em>I know exactly what is going on, I just figured it out, but I\u2019m going to let everyone else stew a little longer.</em>\u2019 And if Clint knew what was going on (though Peter wasn\u2019t exactly sure he himself completely knew what was going on), surely Natasha couldn\u2019t be very far behind. And what <em>did</em> Clint think he knew, and how?</p>\n<p>Peter thought he had been <em>winning</em>.</p>\n<p>Peter grumbled a little, but if he was going to do this introduction correctly, than he was going to do it right. He could only thank whatever higher being that might exist, or another universe\u2019s Wade, or something, that they hadn\u2019t yet gotten to the stage where the removal of clothes was needed.</p>\n<p>Peter sat up further in bed, rolled his eyes, and gestured between Wade and the Avengers. \u201cGuys? I\u2019d like you to meet my fianc\u00e9, Wade Wilson. Wade, these are my coworkers-slash-friends, the Avengers. Now that you\u2019ve all met formally, can you <em>please</em> stop cockblocking me from my own boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve had gotten caught up on the word \u201ccockblock\u201d for a moment, but then it looked like he finally got the gist of it by the way he gaped horribly between Wade and Peter. Tony was squinting, like he had possibly miss-heard something and was trying to figure out what had <em>actually</em> been said. Bruce was hunched over, Natasha scowled, and Clint just looked pleased with himself.</p>\n<p>Thor was the first to speak. He strode over to Peter and shook Peter\u2019s hand, and then Wade\u2019s, as he boomed \u201cI am pleased to hear of your upcoming nuptials. I give my blessing to this joining of hands and hope that the two of you may forever stay in as high spirits as you are at this point in your life and relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. \u201cWell that was unexpected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wade shook his head, and his smile was blinding. His scars pulled up and puckered around his grin, and Peter could hear a small laugh in his voice when he said, \u201cNo it wasn\u2019t! Thor is my brother, he\u2019ll support my decisions. It\u2019s a good thing he approves of you, Peter, because I hear big brothers can really hurt beaus that mess with their younger brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that your parents don\u2019t approve,\u201d Wade continued, waving between Tony and Bruce.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike your \u2018parents\u2019 are super excited to find that I\u2019ve been boinking their son for longer than either of them have known us?\u201d Peter asked, incredulously.</p>\n<p>Clint still hadn\u2019t said anything, and looked like he was content to just watch the show, but Natasha had her eyes squeezed shut, and muttered what sounded like, \u201cWhat is going on? I swear to god, you all get weirder every day. I need more girl friends. Where the fuck is Pepper? She could deal with this way better than I could. Or Maria. Where the fuck is Maria? Maria works with Fury, she knows fucked up. Why couldn\u2019t she deal with this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint patted Natasha\u2019s shoulder comfortingly, and Peter had to hold back a grimace. He hadn\u2019t meant to break Natasha. In fact, he hadn\u2019t known Natasha could be broken.</p>\n<p>Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and asked, \u201cHow long as this been going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and Wade you mean? Well, we met maybe five years ago?\u201d Peter looked at Wade for confirmation, but Wade only shrugged. He was always late anyway. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019ve been dating for four years. Got engaged a few weeks back. You guys know when.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gulped, and a \u201cFuck me\u201d was dragged from him, almost against his will. Then he blinked and turned to Natasha and Clint, his suit making whirring noises as he moved. \u201cAren\u2019t you super spies supposed to know everything? How did you miss that Deadpool was dating anyone, let alone Peter? How did you miss that <em>Peter</em> was dating Deadpool?\u201d He gestured between the boyfriends almost hysterically.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah <em>Mom</em>,\u201d Wade snapped, \u201chow could you miss that your <em>own son</em> had a boyfriend. I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha groaned into her hands and stamped her feet almost childishly. Then she seemed to draw herself upright again. \u201cI honestly cannot tell you. What I <em>can</em> tell you is that I\u2019m going to need so much vodka when this is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint pushed himself off of the wall, smirk still firmly in place, and practically purred as he said, \u201cI knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was almost complete silence, and Peter sent out a little, internal mourning wail that he had been <em>wrong</em>! He hadn\u2019t been winning at all. He\u2019d been <em>loooosing</em>! <em>LOOOSSING</em>!!!</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Natasha gasped out, gaping at Clint, at the same time that Steve said, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint shrugged. \u201cThey seemed much too familiar with each other. And Peter actually <em>likes</em> Deadpool.\u201d Then he turned to Steve. \u201cIt was none of our business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor, who still looked much too genuinely happy, said, \u201cWhen is the day of matrimony?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scratched the back of his head. \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually decided yet. Any ideas, Wade?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is still really weird,\u201d Tony muttered, and Natasha gave him a commiserating look.</p>\n<p>Wade sighed out through his teeth as he settled back into the bed. \u201cPetey-pie, I am down for anything any time at all. I\u2019ve even already got the dress picked out. It\u2019s lavender, I hope you\u2019re ok with that. I figured white wouldn\u2019t be good, because you know, purity and all that? I\u2019ve killed literally hundreds of people, Peter. Literally hundreds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLavender is fine!\u201d Peter exclaimed, trying to stop Wade from saying anything that would make the other people in the room more inclined to dislike him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to sit down,\u201d Natasha said weakly, and Bruce held out an arm to steady her as she walked to the door, though she let him go as she exited, walking away alone.</p>\n<p>Tony rubbed a hand over his eyes, and Peter winced a little, because he was actually rubbing a metal gauntlet over his very sensitive optical organs, but he didn\u2019t seem to even notice. \u201cI\u2019d say that this better not affect either of your work, but considering that it has been months, and none of us even <em>knew</em>, I\u2019m going to say that you both know how to keep it professional.\u201d Wade wiggled his eyebrows and then thrust his hips in the general direction of Peter\u2019s everywhere. Tony sighed. \u201cJust, please, I\u2019ve only got so much sanity left.\u201d He hesitated for a moment before turning on his heel and rushing out. \u201cI need a cold drink. Natasha! NAT! Wait up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor was almost at the door as well before he turned to say \u201cYou must let me know when the celebration will occur. The festivities following the nuptials of such comrades of mine must be extravagant and hearty!\u201d He gave a quick look at the other Avengers still in the room and said, \u201cCome, friends. Let us leave these who are to be bound together to celebrate through conjugal merriment.\u201d And then he was out the door too.</p>\n<p>Wade swooned dramatically and fell onto Peter who shoved him off the bed. \u201cThor is my favorite brother.\u201d Wade pushed himself off the floor and flopped back down onto the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThor is your only brother,\u201d Peter retorted, then paused and amended is statement, \u201cI mean, Thor isn\u2019t <em>even</em> your brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve straightened his back and put on his most Captain America face. \u201cIf you hurt him Deadpool, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d He trailed off at the sight of Deadpool nodding his head vigorously.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Wade asked, and the way his voice cracked a little showed how genuine his plea was. \u201cI won\u2019t mean to, because I love him, but if I ever\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter clamped a hand over Wade\u2019s mouth and curled his other arm around his boyfriend\u2019s waist. \u201cYou will never hurt me,\u201d Peter said softly, and he tried to show Wade how much he believed in him just by the look in his eyes, but he wasn\u2019t sure how much was getting across. Wade\u2019s eyes were wide, and Peter had to fight the urge to kiss him, because this was important. Wade needed to know how much Peter trusted him. And Peter did, Peter trusted Wade with everything, with his life and his secrets, and even with Aunt May. Wade was everything to Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t even realize that they were staring into each other\u2019s eyes still until he heard Steve sigh. Peter jolted and they both turned to see Steve pinching the bridge of his nose. </p>\n<p>He opened his mouth to tell Steve that pinching the bridge of his nose was such a tell, and that he\u2019d be awful at poker because he couldn\u2019t have worked a poker face if he tried, but before he could say any of that, Steve looked to the ceiling in what looked like a silent prayer, gave the couple a weak little smile and trudged out of the room. </p>\n<p>\u201cAwwww,\u201d Wade squealed adorably, \u201cLittle Captain Stars and Stripes is growing up! I\u2019m so proud of him. Soon he\u2019ll be going on dates and raising a family, and teaching little munchkins to slay Nazis. I\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m next,\u201d Bruce said quietly as he stepped to the foot of the bed. Peter looked at him expectantly, absently batting away Wade\u2019s hands as they tried to unbutton his shirt. Bruce looked uncomfortable, which made Peter want to smile more. \u201cI suppose congratulations are in order,\u201d he paused, and then let out a long sigh, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry, for me and everyone, for trying to, you know.\u201d He waved his hand at Wade, and Wade waved back, a giant grin on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo biggie,\u201d Peter insisted.</p>\n<p>Bruce gave a soft smile and a small wave, and he too walked from the room, leaving just the couple and Clint.</p>\n<p>Who was still smirking.</p>\n<p>Peter gave Clint an assessing gaze, but Clint didn\u2019t say anything. He walked calmly to the door, stepped past the threshold, and said, calm as could be, \u201cI won!\u201d before slamming the door shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Peter exclaimed, and had to stop himself from jumping from the bed and chasing the archer down the hall. \u201cI wanted to win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did win,\u201d Wade purred seductively (for Wade, at least, which for a normal person was probably on the other side of the creepy line, but whatever). He walked his finger up Peter\u2019s chest, and when he got to Peter\u2019s shoulder, took the initiative to push him back into the mattress.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Peter asked, mouth curving upward. \u201cAnd what did I win, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis hunk of sexy,\u201d Wade said, beaming, before he attached his mouth once more to Peter\u2019s neck and reached one of his hands down Peter\u2019s pants to grope sloppily at his dick. </p>\n<p>Peter huffed out a chuckle and reached out to grab a pillow which he then smacked against Wade\u2019s head.</p>\n<p> \u201cBut baaabe!\u201d Wade whined, detaching his mouth from Peter\u2019s neck. Immediately the splotch on Peter\u2019s neck that had been reveling in the wet heat of Wade\u2019s mouth chilled in the air, but Peter paid it no mind. He just smiled.</p>"
