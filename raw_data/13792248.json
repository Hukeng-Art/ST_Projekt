  "text": "<p>A black dog, the size of a bear, sat on the curb outside 4 Privet Drive. In the gray dawn, its saucer-sized eyes seemed to glow, reflecting the orange light of a nearby street lamp. The casual observer, yawning and idly looking out their window to check the weather, would have been startled by the creature.</p>\n<p>But Harry, who had barely slept from excitement, was not a casual observer, and, from his second-floor bedroom window, he recognized the dog immediately as his godfather, Sirius Black.</p>\n<p>Harry sprung from his bed and dressed quickly. His trunk was already packed. He had, in fact, barely unpacked it since arriving at the Dursleys, two weeks before, so sure had he been that Peter Pettigrew\u2019s trial would be over quickly, and Sirius would be able to take him in for the summer. </p>\n<p>It had been a longer wait than he\u2019d expected.</p>\n<p>Then, yesterday afternoon, he\u2019d received an owl bearing the short message: </p>\n<p>\n<i>Trial over. Pick you up tomorrow. -Sirius</i>\n</p>\n<p>Harry grabbed his trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage - she hooted at him chidingly - and rushed downstairs. He paused in the entryway to the kitchen, where the Dursleys were already awake. It was odd to see all three up so early, but then, Harry reflected, they probably just wanted to be sure he was actually leaving. None of them looked at him though; they just sat at the table, frowning over a meal of grapefruit wedges, which were a part of Dudley\u2019s diet. It was hard for Harry not to grin. He didn\u2019t know what he and Sirius would have for breakfast, but he knew it wasn\u2019t going to be grapefruit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Dursleys ignored him. Dudley scowled harder at his grapefruit.</p>\n<p>Harry hesitated for a moment. He felt that there should be more to say. He didn\u2019t know when he would see the Dursleys again. Perhaps never.</p>\n<p>The Dursleys still said nothing. The TV set in their fridge nattered on with the morning news. Uncle Vernon prodded at his grapefruit. Hedwig hooted softly. Immediately, Uncle Vernon whipped his head up, his face contorted in a glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet that bloody bird out of the kitchen,\u201d he snarled.</p>\n<p>Harry bit down the urge to snap back that Hedwig wasn\u2019t in the kitchen; she was in the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI will. Have a good summer then.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t wait for a response. He just pulled his luggage out the front door and onto the dew-wet lawn. Padfoot bounded forward as soon as Harry stepped outside, a humanlike grin on his canine face. Then, suddenly, where the dog had been was a man, who met Harry halfway and grabbed him in a tight hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Harry,\u201d said Sirius brightly, when he released Harry from the hug, though he kept both hands on Harry\u2019s shoulders. He looked much better than he had when last Harry had seen him, on the night he had revealed himself and captured Peter Pettigrew. His hair was short and neat, and his face had fullness and color to it. He was no longer in the ragged robes he had escaped Azkaban in but new Muggle clothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d said Harry, beaming. \u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius laughed. \u201cAs soon as our ride shows up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He scanned the street, and Harry looked with him. He knew Sirius had once owned a magical, flying motorbike \u2013 the same flying motorbike Hagrid had first taken Harry to Privet Drive in. He wondered if they would be leaving in that. It made a pleasing sense to Harry.</p>\n<p>But the motorbike didn\u2019t arrive. Instead, a very old and very worn Muggle car turned the corner, rattling terribly, and Sirius\u2019s face lit up with a smile.</p>\n<p>On a street as well-maintained as Privet Drive, a car as shabby as this one was almost as fantastical a sight as a flying motorbike. The car seemed patched together from pieces of other cars, and if it could be said to have a unifying color, that color would be rust. Harry had the feeling it was being held together by magic.</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t care about any of that, because behind the wheel of the car was Professor Lupin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither of you said anything!\u201d cried Harry as Lupin got out of the car.</p>\n<p>Sirius laughed again, and it was easy to see the man he had been in the pictures of Harry\u2019s parents\u2019 wedding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure it was going to work out, but Moony has kindly offered to take us in until I fix up my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, really,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. Like Sirius, he looked much better than the last time Harry had seen him. His face had rounded out and gained color from his year at Hogwarts, but he seemed to have changed even more over just the past couple weeks: he stood straighter. He smiled more broadly. He looked younger.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to go, Harry?\u201d asked Sirius.</p>\n<p>Harry glanced back at the house. All three Dursleys stood in the front window, watching them with narrowed expressions. When they spotted him looking at them, they all flinched. He raised his hand to wave good-bye and saw with satisfaction that they all flinched again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, dropping his hand as he turned back. He smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Lupin lived in Wales, a little over three hours away. They stopped once, for breakfast, at a Muggle roadside restaurant near a petrol station.</p>\n<p>\u201cOrder as much as you like, Harry,\u201d advised Sirius, as they settled in. He put his arm along the back of the booth, behind Lupin. \u201cMy money\u2019s just been sitting in a bank for thirteen years. I have a lot of spending to make up for.\u201d</p>\n<p>After three weeks of being forced to subsist on Dudley\u2019s diet, it felt like a miracle. Harry ordered bacon and sausage and toast and eggs and beans and roasted potatoes. Sirius laughed, but ordered the same. Lupin, with a shake of his head, ordered tea and toast. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you normally like to do over the summer, Harry?\u201d asked Lupin, after their food arrived. Sirius, indiscreetly, dumped half his plate onto Lupin\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Harry hesitated before choosing to answer honestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNormally I just try to keep out of Dudley\u2019s way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin looked thoughtful. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve already gotten that part taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure out something, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Sirius. He leaned across the table with a conspiratorial grin. \u201cNow, I want to hear all about Moony as a professor. Moony only says he was all right, but I reckon he\u2019s selling himself short.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked at Lupin in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right? You were the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor we ever had!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had much in the way of competition,\u201d pointed out Lupin.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head and turned to Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was better than most of our other professors, too. Our first class, he took us to take care of a Boggart and\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>He filled Sirius in on the whole tale. Sirius roared with laughter when Harry relayed the part about Lupin sending a wad of gum hurtling into Peeves\u2019 nose, and then laughed even harder at the part about Snape wearing Neville\u2019s grandmother\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou always were sly,\u201d said Sirius with a proud look at Lupin. He took a deep breath. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d been there to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d said Lupin. He took a sip of his tea, but behind his teacup, Harry could see that he was smiling.</p>\n<p>Harry was ready to help Sirius with the money at the end \u2013 wizard adults rarely knew how Muggle money worked, in Harry\u2019s experience, and Sirius, after twelve years in Azkaban would likely be particularly lost. But Sirius surprised him by offering his wad of bills to Lupin first. It seemed almost rote, like the way Ron immediately deferred to Harry or Hermione when it came to Muggle matters.</p>\n<p>Lupin separated out some of the bills and handed the rest back to Sirius, then flagged down their waitress, a curly-haired girl who only looked a few years older than Harry. She paused as she took the cash and then lowered her voice, glancing around to make sure no one overhead them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to say, I think you\u2019re an <i>adorable</i> family,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Both Lupin and Sirius blushed. Harry grinned. Nobody had ever said anything like that on the rare occasions he\u2019d been allowed out to a restaurant with the Dursleys.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know so much about Muggle money?\u201d asked Harry curiously as they got back into the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother was a Muggle,\u201d explained Lupin. He smiled wryly. \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s been easier to find work in the Muggle world than the wizarding one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius scowled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could kill Snape,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very aware, Sirius,\u201d said Lupin. He started the car with his wand, clearly eager to get off the topic of Snape. Sirius scowled more. He was staring at Lupin intently, to a degree that made Harry wonder if Sirius remembered he was here as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius has a point,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair he got Professor Lupin sacked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI resigned,\u201d said Lupin. He had gone a bit white around his lips, and it occurred to Harry that, even after a year as having him as a professor, he\u2019d never seen Lupin angry or annoyed with anyone \u2013 or at least not obviously. But he was definitely annoyed with Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnder pressure!\u201d said Sirius, nearly a shout.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d asked Harry quickly, trying to defuse the argument.</p>\n<p>Lupin and Sirius glanced at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always done,\u201d said Lupin, after he and Sirius had communicated whatever it was. \u201cOdd jobs. A bit of research and editing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very smart, our Moony,\u201d said Sirius quietly, and Harry wasn\u2019t quite sure who was he speaking to. He was staring out the window now, a stubborn set to his mouth.</p>\n<p>The rest of the drive passed peacefully. They were soon in countryside, and Harry watched green hills and grazing sheep roll by the window. Gradually, the hills became taller and steeper, the landscape a little wilder. Mountains rose ahead of them, and the towns and barns they passed were fewer and farther apart. They were in the type of wilderness Harry associated with the landscape around Hogwarts, during the final stretch of the Hogwarts Express\u2019s journey.</p>\n<p>Finally, they arrived at Lupin\u2019s. The car came to a gasping, shuddering halt in a gravel driveway. The house was a small, snug-looking, two-story building, with blue shutters and a blue door that looked like they hadn\u2019t seen a fresh coat of paint in a long time. The front garden was overrun with shrubs and lilac bushes, and a small gate led to a back garden. A haphazard stone walkway led to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s small,\u201d began Lupin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Harry, already halfway out the car door. He pulled Hedwig\u2019s cage out carefully behind him and let Sirius grab his trunk.</p>\n<p>They walked into the house together. Unlike the Burrow, it was the same size on the inside as it looked on the outside. The floors were wooden and worn, but covered in rugs, and the furniture all looked old but comfortable. There were a lot of books, and Harry recognized several items from Lupin\u2019s office when he had been a professor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in my old room,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIt\u2019s just upstairs. It shouldn\u2019t smell too dusty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and raced up the stairs, eager to see his new room.</p>\n<p>Lupin\u2019s old room didn\u2019t smell dusty, but it did smell like it had been aired out recently and hastily. The walls were whitewashed, and the floor was as worn and rug-covered as downstairs. A pile of quilts sat on one end of the small, wood-framed bed, and a bookcase stood by the head of the bed, a lamp on top of it marking it as a makeshift nightstand. A desk was pushed against the wall by the door, its drawers empty except for a few quills and rolls of parchment. It was a cozy space, but, except for the books on the bookshelf, there was little to show its previous occupant\u2019s personality. Harry wondered if Lupin had taken everything down in anticipation of his arrival.</p>\n<p>He set Hedwig\u2019s cage on the floor and opened it for her. She hooted indignantly and flew to the windowsill above the bed. Harry opened the window for her and took in the view. He saw green hills, broken up by dark copses of trees. He caught the promising silver gleams of several creeks and streams. There wasn\u2019t another dwelling in sight. Hedwig would have plenty of space in which to hunt, and Harry realized he might even have enough space to practice flying.</p>\n<p>He got off the bed and bent down to examine the bookshelf. There were what looked like old school books \u2013 some of the titles Harry even recognized from his own classes \u2013 and dog-eared Muggle paperbacks and several wizarding history books and books dedicated to Dark creatures, though none, Harry noticed, explicitly about werewolves. He grabbed one book that looked interesting and flipped through it. The pages fell naturally to where a photograph was being used as a bookmark.</p>\n<p>Four boys, a couple years older than him, waved merrily at him from within the photo. With a jolt, he recognized his father first, James\u2019 thin face almost the mirror to Harry\u2019s own. James was sitting on the desk in the very room Harry was currently in, though the desk had been pushed against a different wall then.</p>\n<p>Lupin and Sirius both sat on the bed. Lupin was leaning against the headboard, and Sirius was leaning against the window. Their legs were a tangle under a large piece of parchment that spread across both their laps.</p>\n<p>And Peter Pettigrew sat on the floor, his round, mousy face bright and happy, and several more lengths of parchment stacked beside him.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at the four of them, and then he stared at the desk where his father had lounged some twenty years before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope it\u2019s not too small,\u201d said Lupin\u2019s voice behind him, and Harry jerked to his feet and whirled around. Lupin stood in the doorway, Sirius just a step behind him, Harry\u2019s trunk in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. Really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin looked curiously at the photograph in Harry\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Harry showed them.</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s face darkened as he looked at Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to think of him in Azkaban,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf anyone deserves it\u2026\u201d began Lupin uncertainly. He trailed off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one deserves it,\u201d said Sirius.</p>\n<p>Harry said nothing. It had been his decision not to let Lupin and Sirius kill Pettigrew, and he still felt like it was the right one \u2013 at least for their sake. But, after everything he\u2019d learned about Dementors over the last year, he didn\u2019t know if it were any better for Pettigrew.</p>\n<p>They all stood there for a moment in silence, and then Sirius said quietly, \u201cWhat year do you think this was?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin looked at the photo again, frowning thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cSummer after fifth year,\u201d he said. He tapped the photo. \u201dWe didn\u2019t start working on the Map until then.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIn any case, I know it\u2019s early, Harry, but any ideas on what you\u2019d like for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything,\u201d said Harry earnestly. He took the picture from Sirius\u2019s hands. \u201cDo you mind if I hold onto this? I\u2019d like to put it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin looked at him in mild surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. He hesitated. \u201cI may have some other photos of your parents lying around, if you\u2019d like to see those as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry with feeling. He grimaced. \u201cOnly, maybe not tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to take it.</p>\n<p>He stuck the photo to the wall above his bed after Lupin and Sirius left. He considered, for a moment, cutting Peter out. But, Peter had been James\u2019 friend, too. And at that point in their lives, none of them had any idea what was to come. He tried to think what might make him betray Hermione or Ron \u2013 or Hermione or Ron betray him \u2013 and he came up with nothing.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sirius sleeping?\u201d asked Harry that night after dinner. He\u2019d toured the whole house by that point and realized there were only two bedrooms \u2013 one on the first floor that Lupin slept in, and Harry\u2019s on the second. There was another room on the second floor that could have been a bedroom, but Lupin seemed to use it as an office.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch,\u201d said Sirius easily. At Harry\u2019s concerned look, he laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable than anywhere else I\u2019ve slept the last thirteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin lightly. \u201cTea, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sure enough, when Harry came down the next morning, Padfoot was curled up on one end of the couch, a blanket rumpled beside him. His eyes opened as Harry stepped onto the squeaky final step.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, as Padfoot transformed back into Sirius. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Sirius with a yawn. \u201cMoony\u2019s already been up ages. He\u2019s out in the garden,\u201d he added, as Harry looked around for him. \u201cAsk him to come in for breakfast, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and went outside. It was already warm. Lupin was kneeling by some bushes hedged around the back porch, a trough in hand and a pile of weeds beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Lupin \u2013 I mean.\u201d Harry grimaced as Lupin looked up and quirked his eyebrows, amused. \u201cRemus? Sirius says you should come in for breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin stood up and brushed the dirt off his trousers. He was wearing bright pink gardening gloves that looked like something Mrs. Weasley might wear and a broad-rimmed sunhat. He looked faintly ridiculous. But he also looked happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cHow nice. I could get used to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d said Harry smiling.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They settled into a routine quickly. Harry worked on his summer homework, something made especially easy and interesting with Lupin\u2019s steady help and Sirius\u2019s sporadic interjections. Lupin had work of his own \u2013 research and editing, he explained to Harry \u2013 and often the two of them spent most of the morning drinking tea and working side-by-side. Occasionally, Lupin would ask Sirius a question, or Sirius would get involved in one of Harry\u2019s stickier assignments, and then Sirius and Lupin would be off on a long discussion about wizarding history or the habits of dark creatures or the finer points of some theory of Transfiguration Harry had never even heard of or a memory of their own time at Hogwarts. For the first time ever, Harry thought he might return to school knowing some things Hermione didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>When he wasn\u2019t with Harry or interrupting Lupin, Sirius busied himself with making repairs to Lupin\u2019s house or working in the garden.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be useful. It\u2019s nice to be outside,\u201d he explained to Harry when Harry asked if there were something he\u2019d rather be doing. \u201cI might try to get a job eventually, if anyone\u2019ll have me. But for now it\u2019s nice to just do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear Hogwarts is hiring,\u201d said Lupin, joining Harry on the porch. \u201cI could put in a good word for you with the headmaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius let out a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>In the afternoons, after lunch, if the weather was fine, Harry and Sirius explored the land surrounding Lupin\u2019s house. Harry collected smooth river stones, and Sirius often ran on ahead as Padfoot, chasing small animals out of their burrows and splashing throughs streams.</p>\n<p>Often, Sirius and Harry flew. On those days, the summer evenings seemed to last for a very long time, and they flew through an endless lilac light, until the first stars winked into view on the blue and dusky edge of the horizon.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs good as your dad,\u201d said Sirius, beaming, as Harry floated down one evening. \u201cMaybe even better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blushed with pride, and then grinned at Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just have a really good broom,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even the best broom is only as good as the person flying it,\u201d said Sirius. He clapped Harry on the shoulder and then started steering him inside. \u201cAt least I remember your dad saying something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced up at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you ever play with him?\u201d he asked. \u201cOn the Gryffindor Quidditch team, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius laughed, short and booming. \u201cMerlin, no. I always had better things to do with my time than practice. And Prongs would have booted me off the team in a fortnight for insubordination. Moony played a couple times, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a fair flyer, and he has a good eye. So Prongs made him sub on once or twice when one of their usual chasers was out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come he never properly joined?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuidditch schedules don\u2019t necessarily align with the moon\u2019s,\u201d said Sirius, and he sounded a bit wistful. But then he smiled again. \u201cAlso Moony doesn\u2019t really care for Quidditch, even if he\u2019s decent at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t care for Quidditch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMadness, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Sirius. He shoved Harry through the front door. \u201cBut if you asked, I bet he\u2019d be willing to help you practice, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>After supper, they listened to the radio or read or Sirius and Lupin reminisced. Harry liked those nights best, even if they were also painful.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Sirius hated Lily at first,\u201d said Lupin one evening, in response to a question of Harry\u2019s. \u201cI always thought he was jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t jealous,\u201d scoffed Sirius. \u201cI had \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>He stopped abruptly, and both he and Lupin colored. Harry looked between them curiously, but neither seemed willing to explain. Lupin coughed delicately.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn any case, I do think he was jealous of how much time James spent with her, especially after he became Head Boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius huffed and changed the subject, but Lupin caught Harry\u2019s eye and smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous,\u201d he mouthed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They ate vegetables from Lupin\u2019s garden, and once a week, they all drove into town and returned with the car full of groceries. Occasionally, a Muggle would stop by with some gift of food: baked bread or fresh eggs or herbs. Once, girl arrived on a bike, carrying with her a basket full of tiny, ruby-like strawberries.</p>\n<p>\u201cGran says thanks for the help with her arthritis,\u201d said the girl, tucking a strand of blonde hair behind her ear. She looked at Harry and Sirius curiously, who both looked back with equal curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cHer gran\u2019s arthritis?\u201d said Sirius, raising an eyebrow after the girl had left.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a bit of reputation for folk remedies,\u201d said Lupin airily. He brought the basket to his face and inhaled deeply, then passed the basket to Harry. \u201cThat smells exactly like summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry never got a better sense of what exactly it was Lupin did in return for the gifts, though it seemed like Sirius did and found it amusing. It kept them well-stocked in food, at least.</p>\n<p>Lupin cooked simply and Sirius could manage eggs and tinned beans and toast. Harry, to his surprise, found he was a better cook than both of them.</p>\n<p>\"It makes sense,\" said Sirius. \"Both Prongs and Lily cooked well. I think they're the only reason we didn't starve to death during the war.\"</p>\n<p>Privately, Harry figured it had more to do with the fact Petunia regularly made him help in the kitchen, and if he were quiet and didn't muck anything up it was one of the few times he was treated with benign indifference rather than outright hostility. But it was nice to think maybe it was because of his parents, that that was something which connected him to them, like his hair and his eyes and the desk in Lupin\u2019s old room.</p>\n<p>\"What did they cook?\" asked Harry.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, all sorts of things,\" said Sirius. \"Lily had quite a few cookbooks. James just improvised mostly.\"</p>\n<p>\"We could go to Flourish and Blotts if you like, Harry,\" suggested Lupin. \"They might have some cookbooks.\"</p>\n<p>\"And be stared at?\" said Sirius.</p>\n<p>\"You used to rather fancy being stared at,\" said Lupin, with a teasing smile.</p>\n<p>\"Only by people who thought I was handsome,\" said Sirius, with a teasing smile back.</p>\n<p>Lupin laughed and busied himself with setting the table.</p>\n<p>\"Though now that I think about it,\" he said, \"I think most of Lily's cookbooks were Muggle ones. There's a Muggle bookstore a few towns over we could try.\"</p>\n<p>They went the next day. It was a used bookstore, the kind Petunia and Vernon always passed with a sniff and a dark mutter about selling other people\u2019s rubbish. Not that they were particularly fond of bookstores that sold new books, either. At least, Harry couldn\u2019t remember a time either had stepped foot in one.</p>\n<p>The bookstore had a damp but not unpleasant smell to it, and the only other person in it was a sleepy-looking old woman with a wart on her nose, who wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place at the Leaky Cauldron. She nodded at Lupin as if she recognized him and then went back to the rather thick book she was reading.</p>\n<p>The shelves were all close together and densely packed with books. It seemed a maze, but Lupin walked purposefully in one direction, and Sirius in another. After a second\u2019s hesitation, Harry followed Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold these for me, will you, Harry?\u201d said Sirius, sweeping off an entire shelf\u2019s worth of books and depositing them in Harry's arms.</p>\n<p>Harry juggled the books around to hold them all, and, as he did, looked at one of the covers and burst into laughter. A shirtless man with long blond hair and tight black pants had one arm around the waist of a buxom brunette woman, who stared up at him with a panting, open red mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Sirius grinned. \u201cMoony\u2019s taste in books is much more highbrow than mine. I used to read these to annoy my mother, but then I got a bit addicted to them. Let\u2019s see if I still am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, still laughing a bit, and Sirius led them into another aisle and swept up another armful of books \u2013 all paperback mysteries this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are fun, too,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cI might even allow you to read some of these.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry grinned at him. \u201cI think I have enough to read just from the books Lupin already owns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius laughed. \u201cCareful, Harry, or you might end up learning something this summer, and I know for a fact your dad wouldn\u2019t have wanted that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you two done?\u201d said Lupin, popping his head into the aisle. He held up two books. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve found some copies of Lily\u2019s old cookbooks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, still juggling Sirius\u2019s romances. \u201cUnless Sirius needs something else.\u201d</p>\n<p>He felt oddly sad. He wished he could know firsthand his mother\u2019s cooking, his father\u2019s idea of a proper summer, that he could just be staying with his parents\u2019 friends for a couple days, that he\u2019d be seeing his parents again soon. But even with that impossible wish, it was hard not to be happy now, too, in the pleasantly dilapidated bookstore, with Sirius and Lupin both lighthearted and laughing, and a pile of ridiculous books in his arms. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThese should last me for a while,\u201d said Sirius with a breezy smile, and he sailed to the counter and paid for the lot.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They read the days it rained, which was often. Harry loved the sunny days best, but he loved the bad weather days, too, with their dark windows and endless mugs of hot tea and Lupin's sad, rich music moaning from a Muggle record player. Harry usually curled up in the shabby armchair nearest the out-of-use fireplace, and Lupin and Sirius took the equally shabby couch, Lupin with his back to the arm of the couch and his legs stretched out, a crocheted blanket over his lap. Once or twice, Harry glanced over to see Lupin's feet in Sirius's lap, and Sirius's hand resting on Lupin's ankle.</p>\n<p>\"Ah,\" said Lupin, when he saw what book Harry was reading: a book about King Arthur, the same book Harry had picked up from the bookshelf that first day. \"That's one of my favorites. My mother gave it to me the summer before I left for Hogwarts. She said if I were going to learn how to be a wizard, I should have a good example. I think I read it every summer for, well, for years.\"</p>\n<p>Here and there Lupin had underlined certain lines and passages in different colored inks, which made Harry think the underlines had accumulated over the re-reads. If he could crack the code, it would be like a look into Lupin's past, to who he had been and what had resonated with him.</p>\n<p>Near where Harry had found the photograph, Lupin had underlined in a strong hand:</p>\n<p>\n<i>Now, in their love, which was stronger, there were the seeds of hatred and fear and confusion growing at the same time: for love can exist with hatred, each preying on the other, and this is what gives it its greatest fury.</i>\n</p>\n<p>He read that, and he thought about the photo, those four, perennially happy boys, their doom forever a fixed distance away. They had all loved each other, once.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A couple times, on the rainy days, Sirius went away on \u201cfamily business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a place in London,\u201d explained Lupin one evening as he and Harry cooked. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fit for human habitation at the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fit for human habitation when humans lived there,\u201d said Sirius, sweeping in like a storm. He scowled, then shook his head, scattering raindrops.</p>\n<p>Lupin sighed and waved his wand, and a warm breeze passed through the kitchen, drying Sirius and the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Sirius curtly. He stomped to the table and sat down heavily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it that bad?\u201d said Lupin, in a neutral tone. He was looking at the stove, not at Sirius.</p>\n<p>Sirius just snorted. Harry looked between the two of them, waiting for either to say more. But neither did. Outside, the rain continued to beat on the windows. Lupin seemed focused on cooking, and Sirius glared out into the middle distance. Harry poured Sirius a cup of tea and brought it to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your house like?\u201d he asked. He figured he should know. He would be living there someday, though the thought made him sad. He liked living at Lupin\u2019s. He\u2019d like to come back here over the holidays.</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s gaze flicked to him, startled, as if he\u2019d forgotten Harry were there. Sirius could be like that sometimes, Harry had realized. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was something that Azkaban had done to Sirius or just how Sirius had always been.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my\u2026 family\u2019s house. Grimmauld Place,\u201d said Sirius, after a pause. He took the tea from Harry and sipped at it, then scowled again. \u201cMy cousin Narcissa is married to Lucius Malfoy, to give you a sense of what my family is like. Was like.\u201d</p>\n<p>That surprised Harry, and the surprise must have shown on his face because Sirius let out a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot ran away from home when he was sixteen,\u201d said Lupin quietly. \u201cYour grandparents took him in, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d said Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour grandparents were good people,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cNaturally my parents hated them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to live once it\u2019s fixed up?\u201d said Harry skeptically. \u201cYour parents\u2019 old place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius glanced at Lupin, but Lupin was still turned away, prodding at the soup.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Sirius, and he looked away.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next morning, it was still raining. Harry watched the sky from his bed, hoping for enough of a break in the weather to go outside and fly. A flicker of motion caught his eye, and he looked down.</p>\n<p>Severus Snape stood in the middle of the pathway, hunched and scowling. He held something in his hands that Harry couldn\u2019t make out.</p>\n<p>He leapt off the bed and ran downstairs, arriving at the foot of the staircase just as Lupin opened the door to Snape. Harry sat down on the steps and peered at them both through the balusters.</p>\n<p>Snape stepped inside with a sniff of disdain. The rain had made his hair even more limp and plastered it to his head, showing off the shape of his skull. His hem was muddy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour walkway could use some repairs, Lupin,\u201d he said icily, and then he shifted what he was holding \u2013 a goblet, Harry could see now \u2013 to one hand and took out his wand with his other. He pointed his wand at himself, and the mud shot off his robe and splattered across Lupin\u2019s entryway. Harry stood with a disgruntled shout. Snape\u2019s glance flicked to him, and, if anything, his gaze became even colder.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it is true,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin. He took the goblet from Snape. The potion inside it steamed faintly. It must be the Wolfsbane Potion, Harry realized. He\u2019d forgotten the moon was soon, even though he had seen it, two nights before, hanging fat and silver in the purple dusk as he and Sirius flew.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for this, Severus,\u201d continued Lupin mildly. \u201cAnd for the note on my walkway. I always appreciate your observations. You\u2019re welcome to floo next time, if you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat back down. He scowled at Snape, fairly certain Snape couldn\u2019t make out his expression very well at this angle. He wondered if Sirius knew Snape were here. He doubted Sirius would be happy if he did. </p>\n<p>Snape\u2019s lips curled in a familiar sneer. But he said nothing else as Lupin drank the potion and then handed the goblet back. With a curt nod, Snape turned to go.</p>\n<p>Harry stood up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to clean that up, professor?\u201d he said, pointing at the mud still splattered across the floor.</p>\n<p>Snape laughed, a slimy, chilly noise, then smiled at Lupin unpleasantly. \u201cI see your parenting leaves as much to be desired as your teaching.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great teacher!\u201d said Harry. He leapt down the last couple steps to face Snape. Lupin moved swiftly, so that he was suddenly in between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Severus,\u201d he said firmly, directing Snape towards the door. \u201cI look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape slammed the door shut behind him. Lupin sighed, his shoulders dropping. He surveyed the mud in the entryway and then lifted his wand in a sweeping motion, washing it all away.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sirius returned that evening in a particularly foul mood. Harry wasn\u2019t even given the chance to worry over saying something about Snape, because Sirius grabbed his dinner from the counter and went outside to eat it. He stayed out there for the rest of the evening, despite the continuing rain. Lupin said nothing about it, just gently reminded Harry to work on his History of Magic essay and then disappeared into his room to read.</p>\n<p>Snape showed up every day for the next three days, though never when Sirius was around. It seemed they were coordinating things so as to not run into each other. Sometimes that meant Sirius was away on family business, and sometimes that meant he and Harry spent the day far away from Lupin\u2019s, either flying or exploring the woods.</p>\n<p>He caught Sirius and Lupin arguing one evening, after he and Sirius had returned from a day\u2019s hike. Harry was up to his knees in mud and went up to shower. As he came down the stairs, he froze as he heard Sirius say, voice raised, \u201cYou could just let me try!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sank down onto the step and listened closely for Lupin\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t work, Sirius? When was the last time you made something that complicated?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do it, Moony.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin\u2019s response was too quiet to hear, and then Harry heard footsteps and a door open and close. He peeked over the bannister. Lupin and Sirius were both gone. They must have heard him, Harry thought, and moved the argument into Lupin\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>He went back upstairs.</p>\n<p>Sirius must have won the argument, because the next day, Sirius didn\u2019t go out, and Snape arrived early, a small cauldron and a black bag in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a cauldron, Snape,\u201d said Sirius forebodingly, his arms crossed over his chest. </p>\n<p>Snape smiled thinly. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m wrong, but I doubt Lupin could afford the quality of cauldron needed for this potion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Lupin quickly, loud enough to cover whatever Sirius had opened his mouth to say. \u201cRegardless, I appreciate your offer to help Sirius with the potion, Severus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Sirius and Snape grimace at this. Lupin looked between them, and if he were nervous at all, it didn\u2019t show on his face. Instead, he turned to Harry and smiled. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, I have some errands to run in town, if you wouldn\u2019t mind coming with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Harry looked between Sirius and Snape. They both ignored him. It was odd to see Snape hate someone more than he hated Harry, but Harry didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to help by sticking around. He shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Lupin nodded and ushered him out. \u201cLet\u2019s just pray the house is still standing by the time we get back,\u201d he muttered as the door closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Harry laughed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>That was the last Harry saw of Snape that summer. The next couple days leading up to the full moon, Sirius locked himself into Lupin\u2019s office, to emerge several hours later with a freshly made goblet of the Wolfsbane Potion. With Snape\u2019s exit, some of the tension left the house. Though, on the morning of the full moon, Padfoot wasn\u2019t asleep on the couch when Harry went down, nor was he anywhere in the house or the garden. Harry wondered if there had been another argument.</p>\n<p>He made himself a cup of tea and settled on the couch with a letter from Hermione and his still unfinished History of Magic essay. A half hour passed, and then the door to Lupin\u2019s room opened, and Sirius stepped out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou are here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius froze and looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. Hedwig had woken him earlier than usual. She\u2019d been gone for several days, delivering letters to Hermione and Ron, and Harry had been too awake to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Sirius cleared his throat and came to sit next to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoony\u2019s feeling a little under the weather,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always does right before the full moon. I, uh. Was just checking on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused. Harry got the sense Sirius wanted to say more, and so he waited for Sirius to say it. But, after a moment, Sirius shook his head, as if clearing an errant thought, and picked up Harry\u2019s essay. He seemed to skim it disinterestedly, his eyes skipping down the parchment. Then, with a sigh, he put it away and stood up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d asked Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout the potion working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sirius laughed weakly. He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI suppose. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Snivellus told me something wrong to deliberately botch it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d said Harry firmly. He was certain a man who had helped create the Marauder\u2019s Map, who had escaped Azkaban and evaded the Ministry and the dementors for a year, who had been his father\u2019s best friend, could handle something as simple as a potion.</p>\n<p>Sirius smiled tensely.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for the vote of confidence.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut whether or not it works, you\u2019ll be staying with the Weasleys tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind staying here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what my dad would do, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut Prongs wasn\u2019t exactly known for his wisdom, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius and Harry both looked up, startled. Lupin had walked out of his room too quietly for either to hear. He looked very pale and weak, and there were dark bags under his eyes. Sirius quickly helped him into the armchair.</p>\n<p>Harry looked to Sirius in appeal, but Sirius shook his head and placed one of his hands on Lupin\u2019s shoulder and squeezed softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Harry. But Moony and I actually agree on this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate the solidarity though,\u201d said Lupin. He reached up and covered Sirius\u2019s hand with his own. \u201cBut I\u2019ll manage fine with Padfoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Normally Harry loved being at the Burrow, but the whole afternoon and evening, he felt anxious. He was distractible during the Quidditch game he played with Ron and his brothers, quiet at dinner. Mrs. Weasley took his temperature with her hand and then clucked her tongue in even greater concern when he wasn\u2019t warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she said slowly. \u201cYou might as well as get some rest anyway. I won\u2019t send you back to\u2026\u201d She paused, clearly uncertain how to refer to Lupin and Sirius. \u201cI won\u2019t send you back ill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and left for Ron\u2019s bedroom. He sprawled out on Ron\u2019s bed and watched the moon rise full and complacent over the Burrow. Lupin would be fully transformed by now. He wondered if the transformation still hurt, or if the Wolfsbane Potion took care of that, too. It was odd; he hadn't been this nervous over the last full moon. He hadn't thought about it.</p>\n<p>The door opened, and Harry glanced over as Ron came in.</p>\n<p>\u201cMum never lets me out of helping with clean up,\u201d groused Ron.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged at him apologetically.</p>\n<p> \"How do you think they're doing?\" he asked, looking back out the window. </p>\n<p>\"He took the potion, didn't he?\" said Ron pragmatically. He sat on the edge of the bed, beside Harry. \u201cAnd he has Sirius with him, and they said it helped to have another animal around. Lupin\u2019s probably doing better than he has in a while, if that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Yeah...\" said Harry. He didn\u2019t mention that Sirius had been the one to make the potion.</p>\n<p>\"So they're probably just... doing what we're doing, but not human.\"</p>\n<p>Harry tried to picture them: a dog and a wolf, relaxing together in Lupin's bedroom. But he could remember too vividly the deep scratches on the walls of the Shrieking Shack, the broken furniture, how years later, the whole place still radiated fear and pain. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you ever worry about your parents?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, after a thoughtful pause. \u201cWhen Dad\u2019s in trouble at work, or when they fight, or when Mum\u2019s really stressed about money or something Fred and George have done. It\u2019s only natural.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, sitting up. He tugged at his hair. \u201cI know they\u2019ll be all right. I just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron nodded sympathetically and patted Harry\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey will. And, here, I know what\u2019ll cheer you up.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not really supposed to say anything yet, but\u2026 Dad\u2019s got tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final, and he already said you could come.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sirius picked him up the next afternoon.</p>\n<p>\"How is he?\" asked Harry immediately. \u201cDid the potion work?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, and yes,\u201d said Sirius curtly. \u201cIt was a much easier transformation than it used to be.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why are you angry?\u201d asked Harry.</p>\n<p>Sirius looked at him, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just.\u201d He paused, and then laughed abruptly. \u201cI guess I am angry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a patient look, but Sirius shook his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry at you,\u201d he said, clapping Harry on the back. \u201cNow come on. Let\u2019s get home before Remus kills himself trying to be self-sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next few days after the moon were strange. Sirius stuck closer to Lupin than usual, and some of his sunken, haunted look returned. Several times, Harry walked in on the two of them in close, low-voiced conversation in the kitchen. They always sprang apart as soon as they heard Harry, their cheeks red, and Harry took to coughing loudly every time he entered the kitchen, just to give them a warning.</p>\n<p>On one of those occasions, Lupin cleared his throat as Harry turned on the faucet for a glass of water. Harry looked at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot and I have been discussing it, Harry, and if you\u2019d like, Hermione and Ron would be welcome to visit for a bit. Maybe we could even have a birthday party for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked at them in amazement. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a birthday party before.\u201d</p>\n<p>His birthday, he realized with a start, was in only a few days. He was used to not expecting anything for it, so it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that this year might be different. But he didn\u2019t even know what to ask for. He knew he didn\u2019t want the kind of birthday Dudley always had.</p>\n<p>Lupin stepped away from Sirius and smiled at Harry kindly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it some thought. It doesn\u2019t have to be big if you don\u2019t want it to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d said Harry slowly, looking between them, \u201cthat a birthday party could be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The Weasleys and Hermione showed up first, eight of them coming out of the fireplace, two tables and a mountain of food in tow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I wish we\u2019d had more notice!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley as she enveloped Harry in acrushing hug. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t nearly enough time to get everything prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly this is more than enough,\u201d said Harry, laughing. He led everyone outside, to where Sirius and Lupin had already set up one table, several strings of lights, and a large, dragon-shaped balloon. </p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d said Harry to Fred and George. He pointed to Lupin and Sirius. \u201cThey helped make the Map you gave me last year. They\u2019re Moony and Padfoot.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d cried George. He and Fred both looked agog. \u201cYou're telling me they\u2019re Moony and Padfoot? Moony and Padfoot are our favorite professor slash werewolf and an infamous but wrongfully convicted mass murderer?\u201d George pressed his hand to his face in awe. \u201cFred, you may need to catch me. I'm feeling rather faint all of the sudden.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned and left them to their shock. </p>\n<p>Hagrid arrived next with McGonagall. Harry felt nervous around McGonagall at first, but after a crisp, \u201cHappy Birthday, Potter,\u201d she was far more interested in talking to Sirius. Harry caught snippets of their conversation \u2013 McGonagall was interrogating Sirius on being an Animagus. A small, proud smile played at her lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m \u2018fraid Dumbledore can\u2019t make it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cBig things are afoot at Hogwarts this year.\u201d He winked. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t hear that from me. He asked me to give you this though, and this one\u2019s from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry took two wrapped packages from Hagrid carefully. The last birthday present Harry had received from Hagrid had been a book that bit, so he was a little wary. Dumbledore\u2019s was wrapped neatly, in purple paper and silver ribbon, and Hagrid\u2019s less neatly in what looked like old Daily Prophet newsprint. To his relief, it didn\u2019t give any indication that it was about to bite him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thank you for coming. How\u2019s Buckbeak?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cVery well, thanks t\u2019 what you and Hermione did for him.\u201d His eyes already looked a bit misty, and he clapped Harry on the shoulder, hard enough to make Harry\u2019s spine ache. \u201cI can\u2019t tell ye how much it means to me t\u2019 see you happy like this.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been really nice,\u201d said Harry, though it felt too small a thing to say. He gestured at Hagrid with the gifts. \u201cI\u2019m going to put these with the rest.\u201d </p>\n<p>Neville came, too, with his grandmother. Harry took one look at her, and then he and Ron both had to duck under the table, breathless from laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks so much for inviting me, Harry,\u201d said Neville earnestly, when Harry popped back up. \u201cYou know it was my birthday yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it?\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt should be a joint party then. I reckon we can change the cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville turned bright pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. You don\u2019t have to - I didn\u2019t mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do it!\u201d said Harry earnestly. \u201cI\u2019d like to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He liked sharing his birthday better. He wasn\u2019t sure how he felt with everyone\u2019s attention being just on him.</p>\n<p>The evening turning gently into a soft, indigo night. The adults all became looser and more giggly. Even McGonagall was laughing, sitting on the porch next to Neville\u2019s grandmother, each a bit pink-cheeked, and their eyes wicked and gleaming. Harry ducked down when he had to cross their path. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry!\u201d called Molly. \u201cFind your godparents! We\u2019re ready to serve the cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded and went inside to look for them; it had been awhile, he realized, since he\u2019d seen either Lupin or Sirius. Ron and Hermione went with him. Neville was deep in conversation with Fred and George, a fact that Harry found mildly worrisome.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky to get to spend the summer with Professor Lupin,\u201d said Hermione, as they walked into the kitchen. \u201cHe - <i>Oh!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione sprang back abruptly, her face pink. Harry peered around her, just in time to catch Sirius and Lupin leaping apart, faces as flushed as Hermione\u2019s. Lupin\u2019s hair was disheveled, and Sirius was laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d asked Harry slowly. He glanced back at Hermione. She was still bright pink, and she wouldn\u2019t look at Lupin or Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s wonderful, Harry,\u201d said Sirius, very loudly. Lupin gave him a despairing look, but then started to laugh, hard and hysterical. He clutched at the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, Padfoot,\u201d he wheezed.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe just came in to tell you we\u2019re about to have the cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d said Sirius brightly. \u201cCake. Excellent. Yes. Let\u2019s go. Have that cake!\u201d He started laughing again, harder this time, and he and Lupin both grabbed at each other as they dissolved into giggles and slumped slowly to the floor.</p>\n<p>Ron laughed awkwardly. \u201cWe\u2019ll just\u2026 see you both out there,\u201d he said, and then he backed out, pulling Harry and Hermione with him.</p>\n<p>\"What do you reckon that was about?\" he asked, bemused, once they were all back outside.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \"Too much wine?\"</p>\n<p>Hermione said nothing. She had a thoughtful look on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were they even doing?\u201d Ron asked, turning towards Hermione.</p>\n<p>Hermione flushed again.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, a little high and airy. \u201cI couldn't really tell. Sirius\u2019s back was turned, and he was standing in front of Professor Lupin\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She trailed off, very pointedly looking at neither of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn't seem that strange,\u201d said Harry, nonplussed. \u201cI\u2019ve caught them like that loads of times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sure it wasn't strange!\u201d squeaked Hermione. \u201cOh, look! Is that Ginny? I've been meaning to talk to her all evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, Hermione sped off.</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged at Harry, an expression on his face that said he was just as mystified as Harry was.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on now, Harry,\u201d said Molly, interrupting them. \u201cYou, too, Neville,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cThe cake\u2019s ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>She set a gigantic, wobbling cake down on a table. It was covered in candles, and their tiny flames flickered gently in the warm, dark night.</p>\n<p>Harry sat at the table beside Neville, who looked a bit embarrassed. Harry grinned at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really used to this either,\u201d he confided, and then he looked up as everyone gathered around and joined in song. He spotted Sirius and Lupin in the back, both still disheveled, both still laughing, but both looking at him fondly, too. There wasn\u2019t a gift, he thought, that could compare to this. </p>\n<p>The party broke up gradually after the cake was eaten. Harry was grateful that Neville\u2019s presence meant the presents were discreetly smuggled inside so there would be no awkwardness, and which also meant Harry wouldn\u2019t have to perform the uncomfortable ritual of opening them in front of an audience.</p>\n<p>Only Ron and Hermione remained at the end of the party. They had both received permission from their parents to stay with Harry for the next few days.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could sleep on the couch,\u201d said Hermione hesitantly, as they finished cleaning and came inside. Harry realized they\u2019d never actually discussed sleeping arrangements. He\u2019d just assumed Sirius and Lupin had figured it out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s where Sirius sleeps,\u201d said Harry.</p>\n<p>There was an odd pause as Sirius and Lupin looked at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Lupin, coloring. He cleared his throat and brought his hands together briskly. \u201cI think it\u2019s all right if Hermione shares with you and Ron, Harry. As long as you think you\u2019ll have enough space.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry\u2026\u201d said Hermione an hour later, as they all settled down to sleep, Hermione on the bed, and Ron and Harry on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my business to ask, but... is something going on between Sirius and Professor Lupin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Harry both looked at her blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Ron.</p>\n<p>Hermione twisted a strand of hair around her finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, I don\u2019t know. They seem very happy around each other. Professor Lupin\u2019s much happier than we saw him all last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Harry, even more confused now. \u201cHe got one of his best friends back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron nodded his agreement, and Hermione huffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have known you two would be dense about it,\u201d she said crossly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to say something, just say it. You\u2019re being a bloody know-it-all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione colored.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re\u2026 together,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they were, you know.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201c<i>Snogging</i>. When we walked in on them.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ron scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too many of Sirius\u2019s novels,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Privately, Harry agreed.</p>\n<p>She scowled at them. \u201cWould you have believed me last year if I\u2019d told you Professor Lupin was a werewolf?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Harry both hesitated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d said Ron eventually. \u201cBut that's because that's really an awful thing to accuse someone of being. But this is, I mean it's unusual, but it\u2019s not\u2026 It\u2019s not being a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why not believe me now? Honestly, you both have the observational skills of a flobberworm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's not true!\u201d protested Ron. \u201cI observe loads of things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s\u2026\u201d Ron looked around wildly. His eyes landed on Harry and then lit up. \u201cThere's the fact Harry\u2019s gotten taller!\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr you've gotten shorter, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have not!\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hermione and Ron stayed for two days, and the subject didn\u2019t come up again, though several times Harry caught Hermione watching Lupin and Sirius thoughtfully, and that made him watch them more carefully, too. It was true that being around each other made them happy, and, now that Harry was properly observing them, he realized that they touched each other constantly: light, friendly touches to the back or arm or shoulder. Sirius in particular liked to touch Lupin\u2019s hair, and Lupin did always put his feet in Sirius\u2019s lap. But surely those things could just be friendly, too?</p>\n<p>But if it weren\u2019t just friendly, if they were together, as Hermione had said, would Harry mind? No, he thought immediately. If they made each other happy, that was all that mattered. Once, on a trip to London, Harry recalled that Uncle Vernon had made a low, nasty comment about two men holding hands, and Petunia had hastily pulled Dudley closer to her. Harry had thought the two men a little unusual, but hardly the most unusual people he\u2019d ever seen, and, besides, anything the Dursleys disapproved of so strongly was fine with him. He\u2019d smiled at them to be friendly, and been rewarded with two warm and surprised smiles back. </p>\n<p>But surely that meant Lupin and Sirius weren\u2019t together. They could trust Harry not to judge them. Surely they wouldn\u2019t resort to hiding and sneaking around in their own home. </p>\n<p>That settled it for him, and he pushed the subject from his mind. However, the night after Ron and Hermione left, he slept fitfully. It was odd being in his room without the two of them. Eventually, he gave up on sleep and went downstairs for a glass of for water. Padfoot wasn\u2019t on the couch. Harry coughed on the threshold to the kitchen, and, hearing nothing, walked in. He had half-filled his glass when he heard Sirius speak hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what I want, Remus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nearly jumped, and he turned quickly. But there was no one else in the room with him. He realized that the voice had come from outside. The back window had been left open. He crept over, just in time to hear Lupin respond. Harry had to strain to hear him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about what we want, Sirius.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry peeked out the window. Sirius and Lupin were standing on the porch, their backs turned to the window. Sirius held a lit cigarette in his hand, and Harry watched the red, lit movement of it as Sirius passed it to Lupin. His nose twitched at the smell. He felt a little guilty eavesdropping, but that guilt evaporated the second Sirius spoke next.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Harry loves it here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were talking about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry is fourteen,\u201d said Lupin curtly. He took a quick breath of the cigarette and passed it back. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d said Sirius, with an explosive huff of air. \u201cMoony \u2013 think what James and Lily would have wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you bring James and Lily into this?\u201d said Lupin. His back went rigid with fury, but Harry thought Sirius had a point. \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t deserve to live with a werewolf!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry deserves to be raised by people who love him!\u201d bellowed Sirius. </p>\n<p>\u201cBe quiet, Sirius!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius glowered at Lupin, and in a lower voice, that was no less furious for its diminished volume, said, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t deserve to live alone, Moony. Not when you have people who love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did it for thirteen years,\u201d said Lupin, in a cold, hollow kind of voice. \u201cWhat do you think will happen when word gets out Harry Potter lives with a werewolf? What do you think the Ministry will do? What do you think they\u2019ll do to Arthur if they found out he knew and didn\u2019t say anything? No, Sirius. I won\u2019t have it. This has been fun, but you have to realize it can\u2019t be like this forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? It doesn\u2019t matter to me that you\u2019re a werewolf! It doesn\u2019t matter to Harry!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are more people than just you and \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to anyone important!\u201d exploded Sirius. Lupin tried to shush him, but Sirius spoke over him. He waved his hand as he spoke, making angry, red zigzags with the cigarette. \u201cI didn\u2019t escape from bloody Azkaban just so you could shut me out with your bloody werewolf complex!\u201d He grabbed Lupin by the arm and pulled him closer. His face was in profile to the window now, and Harry could see a wild, desperate look in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cAnd we can make this work. I don\u2019t want to be apart from you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too, Sirius,\u201d said Lupin plaintively. \u201cYou know that, but \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius kissed him. Lupin, after a split-second, kissed back. He seemed to sway into Sirius, and his hand came up to grab Sirius by the upper arm. Harry ducked down beneath the windowsill, his cheeks burning. He had never seen anyone kiss like that outside the movies. But beneath the wave of embarrassment, he felt a stab of annoyance that Hermione had been right. And then he felt even more annoyed at Lupin and Sirius. This was all more dramatic than it needed to be. </p>\n<p>Quietly, he went back up to his room.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next day, Sirius was gone. Lupin muttered an excuse about family business, and Harry let it pass until after breakfast, when they began washing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes Sirius always run off when he\u2019s angry?\u201d he asked mildly, as he handed Lupin a dish to dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius isn\u2019t angry,\u201d said Lupin, after a brief pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly,\u201d said Harry, still mild, \u201che seemed pretty angry last night when I heard you two arguing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, Lupin lowered his wand, and the dish he was drying fell gently onto the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him not to shout,\u201d he said evenly, but his face had gone suddenly tense.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him shouting. I came down for a glass of water, and I overheard you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Lupin. His expression didn\u2019t change.</p>\n<p>Harry looked up at him. The morning light slid into the kitchen at an angle and caught the gray in Lupin\u2019s hair, making him seem even older and more vulnerable than usual. Harry felt a sudden, painful fondness.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have asked me. You both could have asked me,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCuz Sirius is right. I do love it here. I want to stay here. And if you and Sirius are\u2026 happy together, I don\u2019t want to be why you have to be separated.\u201d</p>\n<p>He loved Lupin, and he loved Sirius, and he loved this place he\u2019d come to think of as their home. He didn\u2019t want to leave it.</p>\n<p>Lupin grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Harry,\u201d he said gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want us to stay?\u201d asked Harry, a sudden, horrible thought occurring to him. Maybe Lupin didn\u2019t want them here at all, and that was why he was so reluctant.</p>\n<p>Lupin stared at him, astonished.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do, Harry. More than anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin turned his face away. Harry watched his shoulders for some sign of what he felt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d said Lupin, and his voice was calm. But then, if he were calm, why wouldn\u2019t Lupin look at him? \u201cI was so scared of what your father would think when he found out Sirius and I were together. Which was rather silly, I know. He\u2019d taken in stride the fact that I was a werewolf. But\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I suppose I\u2019ve never managed to stop living in fear.\u201d Lupin sighed, and Harry saw his shoulders slump. Then, Lupin looked at him. \u201cIt should stop surprising me how much you\u2019re like your parents, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Sirius was right? That they\u2019d want me to live with you and him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin. He laid his hands flat on the counter and leaned forward slightly, resting his weight there, and then rocked back, his hands flexing with the movement. He took a deep breath.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cBecause they\u2019d want me to happy. And I reckon because they\u2019d want you and Sirius to be happy, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lupin let out a short, startled laugh, and then pressed one hand to his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cAll right. I can see I\u2019m outnumbered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, he smiled, wistful and bemused, but happy beneath that, definitely happy.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Sirius came back early that evening, before the sun had set, with a black look on his face. Lupin met him at the door. Harry stayed in the armchair, but he peeked over the top of it and watched as Lupin drew Sirius close and spoke to him quietly. Sirius\u2019s scowl smoothed out, and he stared at Lupin with an expression of astonishment. He jerked forward as if he were going to kiss Lupin, and then, realizing Harry was in the room, jerked away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d he said, still staring at Lupin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI want you both to stay. Here. With me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to hide that you\u2019re together,\u201d called Harry from over the armchair.</p>\n<p>Sirius and Lupin both looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t hiding anything, exactly,\u201d said Sirius, with an uncharacteristic blush. \u201cWe were figuring things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd have you?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cFigured things out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius looked at Lupin once more. There was a question in his eyes. Lupin looked back at him, even and clear, and then he took Sirius\u2019s hand in his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, still looking at Sirius. \u201cI think we have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry. He smiled at them both. They stood framed in the doorway, a dusky light upon them. Harry thought about the boys in the photograph, and everything that faced them, everything that had brought them back, to this house, to this point. They had loved each other once, and now they loved each other again. </p>\n<p>And now they were Harry\u2019s family, too. There was a whole future of summers and Christmases ahead of them, a future of road trips in Lupin\u2019s old, shambling car, of hikes and flights and dinners and photographs of their own. Harry had never been able to picture more than a year or two into the future, but he could picture years and years now, and what he envisioned filled him with a tremendous hope. </p>\n<p>They would be happy, he thought. That was for sure. </p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome home, Sirius,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a roast for dinner.\u201d </p>\n<p>And then he settled back down onto the chair and re-opened his book.</p>"
