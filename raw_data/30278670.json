  "text": "<p>\n<strong>Part I: NightMonkey </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The top three best moments of Peter life were, in no particular order: his first camping trip with May and Ben; his first time kissing MJ, during a detention; and the first time Clint Barton reposted the drawing he uploaded on Instagram.</p>\n<p>The last two happened on the same day. In fact, Peter received the notification while he was still gazing sappily into MJ\u2019s eyes, his lips tingling. She was staring back at him with an expression akin to amusement. \u201cYou still with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour lips are really soft,\u201d Peter said, before instantly flushing with embarrassment. \u201cI mean\u2026 Yeah, that was cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 <em>the most important meal of the day</em>,\u201d Captain America\u2019s PSA prattled on in the background. Coach Wilson was sleeping in his chair.</p>\n<p>Peter glanced down at his phone to see who had rudely interrupted his unexpected detention-make-out-session with MJ by messaging him. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he breathed, gripping the phone tighter. \u201cOh God \u2013 Ned says Hawkeye just reposted my drawing on Instagram!\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ was not that easily impressed. \u201cProbably someone pretending to be Hawkeye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, <em>no</em>,\u201d Peter said, already scrolling through the app. \u201cThe profile name is <em>ReallyRealHawkeye</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Because that sounds legit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMJ, I\u2019ve been following these people online for years. YEARS. I know which profiles are real! And he\u2026 oh shit, he reposted <em>that </em>drawing? That one was kinda mean, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the one with Iron Man ironing his clothes?\u201d MJ immediately guessed.</p>\n<p>Peter gave a nod. He and MJ had bonded over their mutual interest in ridiculing people through drawings. While MJ favored a more artsy style, making black and white portraits of people in crisis, Peter\u2019s preferred way of expressing himself \u2013 and pissing people off \u2013 was by making colorful, four panel comic strips. Over the last few months, the Avengers had become his favorite victims. He uploaded his drawings on Instagram under his username \u2018NightMonkey\u2019, and some of them had gotten a pretty good response.</p>\n<p>He remembered the way he had cackled evilly while drawing this particular one: Iron Man ironing in his Iron Man suit \u2013 but without the helmet \u2013 when his phone rings and, in a temporary lapse of judgement, Tony Stark lifts the iron to his ear instead of his phone. The results are self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Hawkeye reposted my drawing, do you think Tony Stark will see it?\u201d he wondered out loud. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be offended?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m </em>offended. Thirty seconds ago we were making out,\u201d MJ pointed out. \u201cJust mentioning it. Since you seem to have forgotten already. This is not how I imagined our first kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter said, hastily shoving his phone away. Because, yeah, kissing MJ really <em>should </em>take precedence over anything short of apocalyptic events. \u201cSo you\u2026 you\u2019ve been imagining this moment, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ looked a little caught out. She didn\u2019t like to be accused of having any emotions, let alone the particularly sentimental ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are we\u2026\u201d Peter licked his dry lips. \u201cUm \u2013 are we, like, <em>boyfriend girlfriend</em> now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d MJ said, \u201cas long as it\u2019s clear that I won\u2019t make fun of you any less. And that I don\u2019t need you carrying stuff around for me like I\u2019m some incapable damsel. And no kissing in public; we\u2019re not a roadshow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you maybe like to write up a contract?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck, because I just might,\u201d she warned. \u201cAnd I will make sure to get custody of Ned if we break up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter leaned his head down on the desk, without breaking eye contact with her. \u201cCould I get him on weekends and every other Christmas?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gave him a benevolent smile and reached out to push a strand of his hair out of his eyes. \u201cI like that you\u2019re not weirded out when I make strange, awkward jokes,\u201d she confessed, which was probably as close to an \u2018<em>I have a massive crush on you\u2019 </em> as you could get from MJ. Peter grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d MJ said.</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. He had gotten a detention for being late for two days in a row \u2013 something May already wouldn\u2019t be thrilled about. \u201cYou should be preparing my eulogy if you let me skip detention, because my aunt will <em>actually </em>kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about I go and get us both some milkshakes. I\u2019ll be back by the time your prison sentence is up, and we can go to the park or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if Wilson wakes up? Won\u2019t you get into trouble?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually have detention,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI just came to see you in crisis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of freaking course. \u201cOkay then,\u201d he said with a soft smile. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waited for MJ to leave, then grabbed his phone to scour the internet for gossip about Tony Stark.</p>\n<p>If Hawkeye liked comics that made Stark look like an idiot, then Peter would certainly oblige.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The NightMonkey might have a bit of a mean streak, but Peter Parker always made a point of being kind.</p>\n<p>The caf\u00e9 where he worked every Saturday had many regular customers, and Peter knew them all by name. Including the homeless people who came by from time to time because they knew Peter would serve them free coffee and sometimes throw in a donut.</p>\n<p>Peter always made sure to have a little chat with them, treat them as a human beings instead of giving them a wide berth like most people tended to do.</p>\n<p>Don, the owner, definitely wouldn\u2019t be thrilled to learn that Peter was giving away food on a regular basis. But hey, he always hid away in the back, letting Peter do all the work and only occasionally coming out to point out everything Peter was doing wrong. He paid only half the minimum wage and he always, <em>always</em> made Peter work late because the sonnuvabitch knew how much Peter needed this job to support May.</p>\n<p>So yeah, Peter was giving away donuts and even throwing in some extra chocolate sauce whenever he felt like it. Sue him.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s homeless guy was one Peter hadn\u2019t seen before. But that wasn\u2019t unusual. Sometimes people had heard through the grapevine that they could come here for free coffee. And sometimes they just wandered in by chance, hoping to be able to get a little warm inside before getting chased out again. This one looked like he fell into the latter category: he didn\u2019t seem to expect to be offered anything. He just sat in a corner booth, his back towards Peter, hunched over, trying valiantly to look invisible. He had a large coat, the hood pulled forward as far as possible, and stained jeans.</p>\n<p>Peter poured a cup of coffee and eyed the selection of donuts for a while. This man definitely looked like a banana-cinnamon sort of guy.</p>\n<p>When he approached the man, he thought he actually heard something akin to a low growl in the back of the guy\u2019s throat. He was probably expecting to get thrown out into the cold.</p>\n<p>Poor dude.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d Peter asked lightly as he set the tray down. \u201cAnd a donut? It\u2019s on the house.\u201d</p>\n<p>It stayed quiet for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me a donut,\u201d the man then repeated, a little hoarsely. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for homeless people to be suspicious when Peter gave them free food. \u201cThere\u2019s no strings attached,\u201d he gently explained. \u201cYou just look like you had a rough day. And it\u2019s pretty cold out. Don\u2019t worry, you can stay as long as you want. But if the owner comes in and just sees you sitting here, he\u2019ll chase you out. So best pretend that you paid for this, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you\u2026 Do you think I\u2019m homeless?\u201d The man asked, a strange edge to his voice, and Peter suddenly felt his stomach drop. <em>Oh damn</em>, did he just insult some random New Yorker, in full possession of a roof over his head? He didn\u2019t usually make that mistake. With his luck, the guy was probably someone important like a state judge, or a politician, or\u2026</p>\n<p>The man sat up straighter, letting his hood fall back and tugging his scarf down and <em>oh God</em>. Peter absolutely froze, wishing a hole would open up in the middle of the caf\u00e9 and swallow him whole.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I looked <em>that </em>horrible,\u201d Tony Stark said. \u201cI mean, granted, I got my workshop-jeans on, but I\u2019m wearing my expensive shoes for chrissake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Peter managed. \u201cOh my god, Sir, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so\u2026 <em>Gah</em>, I\u2019m an idiot. And you\u2026 You have very nice shoes, of course you do, very nice. I just don\u2019t know anything about fashion I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m an idiot, oh my God-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Stark cut in. \u201cAs entertaining as it is so watch you unravel, allow me to put you out of your misery. Not offended, here. In fact, I\u2019m guilty of prejudice, too. When you came up, I figured you were some fanboy angling for an autograph. Instead, you were feeding the homeless.\u201d He grinned as he plucked up the donut with two fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel bad for being kind. And I <em>did </em>in fact have a rough day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, if I\u2019d known it was you I probably <em>would</em> have angled for an autograph,\u201d Peter said earnestly. \u201cWell, maybe I wouldn\u2019t, because I don\u2019t want to bother the customers, but I'd definitely quietly hope that you would spit into a napkin and leave it behind so I would get to keep it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Mr. Stark said. But he was still smiling, so Peter figured it was okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did you want to order something then, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, this looks perfect, actually,\u201d the man replied, waving his hand at the cup of coffee. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d He pulled his hood back up to hide his face.</p>\n<p>Peter nodded and retreated back to the counter where a lady was waiting to order, resisting the urge to bow a few more times in Tony Stark\u2019s direction as he went.</p>\n<p>Holy shit, <em>the </em>Tony Stark was casually eating a donut in his caf\u00e9. Peter would totally use it as the topic of his next cartoon-drawing, except that went against his principles not to aggravate the costumers. Tony Stark was\u2026 well\u2026 he was Tony Stark. But in here, he was just another customer and it was Peter\u2019s job to make sure he had a positive experience.</p>\n<p>That was what he loved about working in this caf\u00e9. He enjoyed taking care of people.</p>\n<p>A sweaty, bald man clutching a large camera stepped into the caf\u00e9 and immediately shuffled up to the counter. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen Tony Stark running past here by any chance, have you?\u201d he asked, half-jokingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013 yeah I did,\u201d Peter said as he gathered three teacups together on a tray. \u201cWent that way.\u201d He pointed randomly.</p>\n<p>The photographer swore under his breath and ran back out the door so fast he almost bum-rushed two elderly ladies who were about to enter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my,\u201d one of them said, stumbling, and Peter quickly left his tray behind to rush to her aid. \u201cHello Mrs. Albasiny, Mrs. Zellerbach,\u201d he greeted, extending an arm. \u201cLet me give you a hand. Booth by the window for you ladies?\u201d He glanced towards the empty booth next to Mr. Stark. The man probably wouldn\u2019t mind two adorable old ladies at the next table.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Albasiny clutched his arm like it was her lifeline. \u201cThe world moves faster every day,\u201d she complained. \u201cThey ought to put handrails all over the place. I\u2019d walk from my apartment to this caf\u00e9 without ever having to let go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the doctor did say you shouldn\u2019t go out without your walking stick, Edna,\u201d Mrs. Zellerbach chided.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doctor told me five years ago that I had four months to live. I don\u2019t trust a single word that comes out of his mouth. I wouldn\u2019t trust him to locate his own asshole, let alone mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all so happy that you\u2019re still with us,\u201d Peter said, his voice only slightly teasing, as he delivered the ladies to their booth and helped Mrs. Albasiny sit down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sweet darling boy, Peter,\u201d she said, reaching up to pinch his cheek.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t usually mind when she did that, but right now he could feel Tony Stark\u2019s eyes burning into his back. \u201cThank you Mrs. Albasiny,\u201d he said meekly. \u201cA chai tea and a cappuccino, as usual?\u201d</p>\n<p>The ladies also ordered a piece of cheesecake to share between the two of them, and Peter once again hastily retreated to the counter.</p>\n<p>He was about to step into the back to grab some clean napkins when he bumped into Don, who poked his head through the doorway. The man threw a disinterested glance around his caf\u00e9, before that glance finally settled on Peter. \u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d Don informed him. \u201cMake sure you turn off all the lights when you leave, because you missed the one by the backdoor last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter bit the inside of his cheek for a moment. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he then said. It was over an hour before closing time, but Don had taken up the habit of leaving earlier and earlier each week, leaving Peter in charge. Part of Peter knew that that shit really wasn\u2019t acceptable. Another part of him, though, was happy to have the caf\u00e9 to himself for a few hours. It was not as if Don did any work when he <em>was </em>here, anyways.</p>\n<p>Time ticked by. Costumers entered, customers left. Tony Stark remained unmoving, quietly sitting in the corner booth, making little drawings on the napkins. When Peter approached him to ask if he needed anything else he just shook his head.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Albasiny and Mrs. Zellerbach were the last customers to leave, with lots of pinching of cheeks and clucking of tongues.</p>\n<p>Peter let the door fall shut behind them and turned the sign to \u2018closed\u2019. He saw how Mr. Stark half-turned in the booth, looking his way but not asking anything. He still looked haggard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go yet,\u201d Peter offered. \u201cI\u2019ve put up the \u2018closed\u2019 sign, but still have to clean the whole place, so you can stay until I have to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. Stark said. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for someone to pick me up. He won\u2019t be long, but it would be helpful if I can wait inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just nodded and set to work. He finished the paperwork and moved the food into the fridge, and then began mopping the floors. When he had worked his way over to where Mr. Stark was still sitting, the man spoke up again. \u201cAre you-\u2026? You can\u2019t be the only one working here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged in a way that he hoped looked nonchalant. \u201cThe owner left early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d said Mr. Stark.</p>\n<p>Peter leaned down to check whether any assholes had stuck gum underneath the tables. When he found none, he rightened himself and glanced back at Mr. Stark who was still following all his movements with a detached expression, as if Peter was a mildly interesting television show. \u201cMy decathlon team is visiting your expo in Manhattan next week,\u201d Peter offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm \u2013 Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark nodded. \u201cI might be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be cool,\u201d Peter earnestly said. He picked up the bucket and carried it to the back where he emptied it into the sink. He loaded the dishwasher. When he stepped back into the caf\u00e9, it was suddenly strangely deserted. Tony Stark had left. Through the windows, Peter just saw the tail lights of a car.</p>\n<p>He moved to the corner booth to clean it and gathered some of the napkins, glancing down at Tony Stark\u2019s abstract drawings. Huh, the man was certainly no slouch as an artist. Who\u2019d have thought Tony Stark had a secret talent like this?</p>\n<p>He found a short message written on one of the napkins.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks for the kindness, Peter. Sorry, I didn\u2019t spit in it. But maybe an autograph will do? </em>It was signed <em>Tony Stark</em>, and folded into it was a crisp fifty dollar bill.</p>\n<p>Peter actually felt tears burn behind his eyes. Jeez, he was about to start bawling in the middle of a caf\u00e9, as if he were Halle Berry winning her Oscar. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was for the money, which more than doubled his salary for the day, or for the personal message. Probably both, he decided, before carefully tucking everything away into an inner pocket.</p>\n<p>Only when he came home that evening did he see the news from earlier that day: Tony Stark had been followed around the city by a stampede of paparazzi photographers. He had driven his car into a lamppost in his attempts to get away from them, before ditching the car, taking off running, and disappearing down an alleyway. That\u2019s how he must have ended up hiding away at the caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Poor guy.</p>\n<p>Peter should definitely make a comic strip about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part II: Parker Benjamin </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI made pasta Arrabiata; it\u2019s in the fridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>May nodded gratefully, disappearing for a moment into the bedroom before reemerging with a clean t-shirt on. She made a beeline for the fridge and took out the bowl Peter had left for her there. She grabbed a fork a started poking at the food, shuffling closer to Peter and glancing at all the papers he had laid out on the coffee table in front of him. \u201cStill doing homework?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo \u2013 and did you know we have a microwave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve recently discovered that I like my pasta cold.\u201d She moved around the table to sit sideways on the couch, glancing down at his notes. \u201cWhat are you doing, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony Stark is researching solar distillation and he just published a new design of a solar still on his website, that has a flat plate collector and uses thermosyphon mode which gives a ten percent higher yield. But I figured, if you can somehow harness the heat loss and use it for <em>further </em>distillation, the overall efficiency is even higher!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have concussed patients who talk less gibberish than you,\u201d May said, before forking a large bite of pasta into her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cGibberish, hah! I\u2019m just trying to figure out the calculations so I can send them to him. Do you think he\u2019ll read them? And Spider-Man stopped a mugging last night. Oh, and NightMonkey gained <em>so </em>many followers since that one comic went viral, it\u2019s insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm-hm,\u201d said May. \u201cAnd what about <em>Peter Parker</em>; did he brush his teeth and finish his homework?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Her gaze turned stern. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. I even finished the book report that\u2019s not even due for another week.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled now, reached out and squeezed his arm. \u201cOh, well done, honey. I\u2019m proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally. <em>That </em>gets a compliment?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged and turned her full attention to her food. People who accused Peter of eating too much had never seen May fork down a meal after a double shift at the hospital. She probably <em>didn\u2019t </em>even like her pasta cold; just wanted to get it all in her mouth as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny weird injuries today?\u201d Peter asked once she had finished and set the bowl down with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cHad a little boy who stuck a bean up his nose, weeks ago,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the thing had started sprouting in there. Nice and moist, of course. He needed surgery to have it removed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shuddered. \u201cOh god. Remember when I pushed a piece of clay up my nose? I couldn\u2019t get it out and panicked. But uncle Ben just made me blow my nose and it came right out. I was glad then that I told him, even though he mercilessly made fun of me for about three months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, <em>twelve </em>is far too old to still be getting things stuck up your nose,\u201d May pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a scientific soul, May. I needed measurement-based testing and practical experiments.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-hm. And the hypothesis you were researching when you pushed that clay up your nose was\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure anymore, but there <em>is </em>something interesting about beans being able to sprout inside a human\u2019s nose, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Doogie Howser,\u201d May said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you discuss it with your pen-pal Tony Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pushed his face into a pillow to muffle his dramatic, high-pitched scream. May chuckled and Peter felt her fingers poking the side of his leg. \u201cPeter, I\u2019m teasing. I just think it\u2019s funny how much your life revolves around Iron Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lifted his head and clenched the pillow to his chest. \u201cIt does not,\u201d he sputtered. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that the guy keeps turning up everywhere. If anything, <em>his </em>life revolves around <em>me</em>. And these are all just entirely coincidental interactions and definitely <em>not</em> something that could end up getting me arrested by SHIELD for being a creepy stalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>May inhaled sharply through her nose, clearly trying to hold back laughter. \u201cI\u2019m sure Tony Stark will be nothing but delighted to discover that the same kid who mistook him for a homeless guy last weekend, has now taken an interest in his research.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that was the thing.</p>\n<p>Peter had sort of decided he would not be emailing Tony Stark under his own name. He hadn\u2019t planned being secretive, but now that he had met Tony Stark in real life, it seemed weird to use his real name. He didn\u2019t want Mr. Stark to <em>actually </em>think that Peter was some creepy stalker. He had settled on the pseudonym \u2018Parker Benjamin\u2019, and had already made a separate email account to match it. Now he just needed to remember to check it regularly for a response.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he was crazy to think that he might get a response.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Parker Benjamin might be a genius, but Peter Parker could be embarrassingly dumb.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been confronted with his own stupidity plenty of times, already. Having MJ as his girlfriend didn\u2019t help there, because she was more than glad to point out when he was being a blathering idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Peter,\u201d she would say. \u201cPeople don\u2019t swallow spiders in their sleep. That\u2019s an urban myth. Stop panicking. And <em>don\u2019t </em>put duct tape on your mouth at night, you blathering idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter trusted her, but he still tried to breathe through his nose every night when he went to sleep.</p>\n<p>But all that was nothing compared to his most impressively embarrassing moment, which occurred during his visit to the Stark Expo, with his whole decathlon team there to see it.</p>\n<p>He had overslept and skipped breakfast \u2013 even though he <em>knew </em>how much that tended to throw his whole body out of whack \u2013 to be at school in time. And then Ned had convinced him to sit in the far back of the bus, where every bump felt like getting launched by a catapult, and fed him an endless supply of marshmallows. Peter had initially readily accepted them, glad to have something to fill up his empty stomach. But about halfway through the drive, he had felt those same marshmallows try to crawl back up his throat at every sharp turn the bus driver made; like they had united forces and formed one giant marshmallow and wanted to break out from whichever entrance they found first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now he was walking around the expo with nausea rolling heavily in his gut. The tour guide was enthusiastic and everything on display was equally amazing, but Peter barely registered what he was seeing \u2013 too focused on breathing calmly and steadily to keep from throwing up.</p>\n<p>They were moving from the \u2018green energy market\u2019 to the building where the keynote speech would be held, and Peter officially wanted to give up. He was glancing around for a toilet he could escape to and spend the rest of the day, when he almost bumped into Ned, only now noticing that everyone else was standing stock-still and a tense hush had descended over their group.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoying the tour?\u201d a voice spoke up; one that Peter recognized immediately .</p>\n<p>He turned, blinking through a haze of <em>please don\u2019t throw up </em>and could barely make out Tony Stark standing only a few feet away from him. He wasn\u2019t addressing Peter specifically, though, his gaze encompassing the whole team, a benevolent smile on his face.</p>\n<p>He clearly didn\u2019t even remember Peter. But that was okay. Peter wouldn\u2019t have wanted to draw attention to himself when he was already so busy valiantly fighting down a wave of nausea.</p>\n<p>The two security guards who were flanking Mr. Stark paused, hesitating, and exchanged a glance that clearly said <em>\u2018Is Stark actually going to bother with this group of smelly teenagers?\u2019</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the decathlon team from Midtown Tech, Mr. Stark,\u201d the tour guide said brightly. \u201cWe were just on our way to your speech. Well. So are you, clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned\u2019s hand shot into the air so fast he almost knocked Mr. Harrington\u2019s glasses off. Mr. Stark\u2019s gaze drifted in his direction. \u201cWe have a Q&amp;A after the speech, kid. But I like the enthusiasm. What\u2019s so important?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Ned said, a little breathless. \u201cDid you see that comic from NightMonkey that went viral?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony Stark\u2019s left eye twitched.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026where you accidentally burn your own ear off?\u201d Ned continued, either not realizing or not caring that Peter was purposefully stepping all over his toes to stop him talking.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Mr. Stark said smoothly. \u201cAnd for the record \u2013 I don\u2019t iron my own clothes. Some of us have better things to do.\u201d He turned away from Ned to another kid who had raised her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, he totally saw your comic!\u201d Ned breathed at Peter.</p>\n<p>Stepping on toes was too subtle, apparently. Peter opted for a swift kick at Ned\u2019s ankle. Anything to keep the other boy from outing him as NightMonkey right in front of Tony Stark when he already felt ready to faint.</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch - Why are you kicking me so much?\u201d Ned whispered. \u201cDo you want another marshmallow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter whirled away from him and promptly threw up... all over Tony Stark\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>Groans and exclamations of disgust filled the air as Peter stumbled back, horrified, his vertigo hitting him only harder. He could feel he was only minutes away from throwing up <em>again </em>and needed to get out of here fast.</p>\n<p>He could feel arms catching him \u2013 whether it was Ned or Mr. Harrison he didn\u2019t even know \u2013 and quickly leading him away from the group.</p>\n<p>The restroom was probably only a minute away, but it felt like the damn thing was somewhere on top of mount Everest. They finally reached the blessed relief of a cold, marble toilet bowl and Peter threw up again, recoiling at the disgusting sight of half-digested marshmallows floating around in the toilet bowl. This second round did instantly make him feel better, though. He breathed out in relief as he felt his heartbeat return to a more normal rhythm. He took off his backpack and kicked it away, then reached out and flushed the toilet, wiping some sweat of his brow. \u201cOh god,\u201d he said miserably, pinching his eyes shut. \u201cOh god, I threw up on Tony Stark\u2019s shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>A chuckle sounded, from somewhere to his left.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t see the humor in the situation. \u201cHis shoes probably cost a thousand bucks each. A thousand for the right and a thousand for the left. And I\u2019ll have to pay for new ones and I <em>can\u2019t </em>pay for new ones and he\u2019ll make me clean the whole Avengers tower with a toothbrush until I\u2019ve paid off my debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s an asshole like that,\u201d the voice said. It was a voice Peter recognized, and horror instantly washed over him like a freaking tsunami.</p>\n<p>He whipped his head around \u2013 his vertigo did not respond kindly to that \u2013 and saw his worst suspicions confirmed when he laid eyes on <em>the </em>Tony Stark himself, casually leaning against the wall, his sunglasses pushed up into his hair. He wasn\u2019t wearing his shoes anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmmmm\u2026\u201d Peter said as his brain short-circuited.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d <em>the </em>Tony Stark asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cRe-\u2026 Re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought me a donut last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked up at him, arms and legs still clenched around the cold toilet bowl, koala-style. \u201cYou remember <em>me?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember everyone who brings me food. It\u2019s practically imprinting. You\u2019re my momma bird now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGross,\u201d Peter said, grasping for some toilet paper to wipe his mouth. \u201cUm \u2013 my puke, I meant. Not your analogy. Sir \u2013 your shoes\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Stark lamented, wiggling his eyebrows. \u201cYour cleaning duties start tomorrow. Bring a toothbrush.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter would have laughed if there wasn\u2019t a part of him still afraid that Mr. Stark was being dead serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Midtown Tech, huh?\u201d Mr. Stark said. \u201cA school for smart beans. Are you a smart bean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s two times a thousand bucks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Peter mumbled, still torn on whether Mr. Stark was teasing or simply tightening the noose. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 I mean\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 two. Thousand. Two thousand, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was some <em>real</em> quick math, squirt. I can see why you\u2019re in a STEM school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter was pretty sure he could have fried an omelet on his face right about now. Mr. Stark just chuckled, standing and moving past Peter to the sink. Peter slowly turned and leaned his back against the wall, so he could keep Mr. Stark in his field of vision.</p>\n<p>He now realized that they weren\u2019t in a public bathroom; at least, it was way too shiny and quiet to be a public bathroom. Had he just thrown up in Mr. Stark\u2019s fancy, private facilities?</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark started rummaging through a cabinet. \u201cAnd how much do you figure I should pay you by the hour, to clean my tower with a toothbrush?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter swallowed. \u201cSir, I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of the tap running, and a moment later Mr. Stark extended a plastic cup to him. Peter took it, taking a sip of the water to rinse his mouth, spitting it into the toilet bowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch as I\u2019d like to continue my little experiment of seeing how red your face can get, I suppose I should cut you some slack, since you are sick and since I, contrary to popular belief, <em>do </em>have a heart. So\u2026,\u201d Mr. Stark crouched down in front of him, both his knees popping, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about the shoes, squirt. I have around two hundred other pairs. They have their own room. It\u2019s bigger than Captain America\u2019s bedroom. My point is; forget it ever happened. Which won\u2019t be easy because, knowing teenagers, your classmates will lord this over you forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just stared up at him, eyes wide, both hands clenched around the plastic cup.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Venga</em>,\u201d Mr. Stark said. \u201cStop looking so scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really serious?\u201d Peter whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I serious about not making you into my toothbrush-wielding slave? Yeah, I think I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo but I mean,\u201d Peter paused for a minute to take another sip of water, \u201cyou could still sue me or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a knock on the door and one of the security guards poked his head in. \u201cMr. Stark,\u201d he said in a deep voice. \u201cMiss Potts reminds you that the key note speech was due to start five minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat gives me roughly another twenty minutes to be fashionable late,\u201d Mr. Stark stated, his eyes still steady on Peter\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m guessing we should be calling a parent right about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, you don\u2019t have to-.. You must be very busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d the man said, his voice now flat. \u201cStop worrying. I have nowhere to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snapped his mouth shut, blinking fast because <em>holy shit, Tony Stark remembered his name</em>. \u201cThis is... insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is,\u201d Mr. Stark said. \u201cYou were kinder to me last week than most people I\u2019ve met in my life, and you didn\u2019t even know who I was. This? This is\u2026 nothing.\u201d He took out his phone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me who I can call to pick you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay,\u201d Peter murmured. He took another sip of water, then closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep, steadying breath. The nausea had subsided and he didn\u2019t think he would throw up again. The vertigo was still unpleasant, though.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until he opened his eyes again and saw Mr. Stark patiently looking back at him that he realized a first name wouldn\u2019t exactly be enough information for this man, even if it was Tony Stark. \u201cUh,\u201d he said - and God, could he stop blushing already? \u201cHer number is in my phone \u2013 let me\u2026\u201d He planted one hand against the cold, clammy tiles to give himself some leverage. But before he could push himself up, Mr. Stark had already reached for his crumpled backpack and pulled it closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the front pocket,\u201d Peter quickly squeaked, because <em>oh boy</em>, if Mr. Stark opened his backpack and spotted the Spider-Man suit crammed in there; or the NightMonkey sketches; or his own research on solar distillation with Peter\u2019s notes in the margin\u2026</p>\n<p>Yeah, he\u2019d be busted. Three times over.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Stark just opened the front pocket, fishing out Peter\u2019s bruised and battered phone. \u201cThis piece of crap is yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s seen better days,\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cI should probably, uh-\u201c he reached out a hand to help Mr. Stark unlock the phone, but before he could even finish his sentence, Mr. Stark had done something complicated, aiming his own phone at Peter\u2019s screen, and there were little bleeps and whooshing noises and then Mr. Stark just started merrily tapping through Peter\u2019s phone, as if this was something he did on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just hack my phone?\u201d Somehow that was equal parts offensive and awesome.</p>\n<p>\u201cH I J K L, May. May\u2026 Parker? That your mom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark merely nodded as he tapped the screen again.</p>\n<p>Peter shifted his position a little. \u201cI really like your work, sir. I read all your papers on-\u201c he faltered, suddenly worried that he might give something away if he\u2019d start talking about solar-distillation right now. \u201cOn, umm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark chuckled as he lifted the phone to his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, squirt. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be familiar with my research. - - Yes, hello? Is this May Parker speaking? I have something here that belongs to you. Brown hair, comically large eyes, nerdy t-shirt \u2026 Sounds about right \u2026 Yes, he\u2019s fine, just threw up all over the Stark expo, but otherwise peachy, any chance you can- \u2026 Uhuh \u2026 That\u2019s the place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter took another deep breath, leaning his head back against the tiles and trying not to feel guilty about making May leave work.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her way,\u201d Mr. Stark said, hanging up. \u201cWhile we wait, why don\u2019t you go ahead and ask the famous Tony Stark something you\u2019ve always wanted to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grasped for a question that had nothing to do with solar-distillation but came up with nothing. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d was all that came out in the end.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark laughed again, slapping his knee. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to a STEM-school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part III: Spider-Man </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a particularly nice afternoon in Queens, with the sun shining and the birds tweeting and the whole shebang. It had been raining all morning, so Peter was feeling rather content as he could now relax on his favorite rooftop: right on top of the hospital where his aunt worked. The temptation to take off his mask and let the sun hit his face was hard to resist. But he knew better than to make a rookie mistake like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoying the view?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter jumped a little and turned around. It wasn\u2019t often that Iron Man managed to sneak up on him with that big, loud, ugly suit of his. Peter must have been really lost in thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>was </em>actually,\u201d he said, glancing back at the large mural painting looming over them. The colorful artwork was another reason why he loved sitting on this particular rooftop. It was an abstract group portrait, and if Peter cocked his head and squinted, he could see his uncle Ben in one of the figures, smiling down at him.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark glanced up at the mural painting, too. \u201cMeh. Average at best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter bristled. No one was allowed to call <em>anything </em>that reminded him of his uncle \u2018average\u2019. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind, Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can probably bribe the artist to paint your bedroom walls, if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Was that another way for Tony Stark to try to get his address, his identity? \u201cGood luck. I googled the artist once,\u201d Peter said, \u201cbut nothing came up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The painting must have been commissioned by someone. And it was signed with the name <em>Nescio </em>in the lower right corner, but Peter had never been able to find a full name. He had never been able to send the artist an email, thanking him for making Queens a little brighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like art, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhm,\u201d Peter said, an image of his latest NightMonkey comic flashing through his head. <em>Abort. Abort.</em> He jumped to his feet. \u201cNever mind. Change of topic. So what brings you to my neck of the woods?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWaiting for my future murder victim. If our intel is correct, a woman we\u2019ve been looking for for a <em>looong </em>time is about to walk into that building right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter squinted at the building across the street, then looked back at Mr. Stark. \u201cFraser &amp; co? Don\u2019t they just own parking lots?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, but the company has been used as a cover to launder millions of dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>Behind him, Peter spotted the roof door swing open and out stepped Captain America and Black Widow, both looking grim and completely ready to kick some butts. \u201cHey websy,\u201d Romanoff said, lifting her chin a little in greeting.</p>\n<p>Peter wanted to squawk in indignation at the uncool nickname, but really, how could he be mad about it when it was Black Widow saying it?</p>\n<p>Iron Man took a step back so they all ended up standing in a neat semi-circle. \u201cI thought you were going to bring the quinjet?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Romanoff said in her smooth voice. \u201cI just parked it out of sight. Or did you want me to fly overhead with a large big banner saying \u2018the Avengers are here\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, although I wouldn\u2019t say no to you flying <em>out of here </em>later with a big banner saying \u2018the Avengers <em>were </em>here\u2019. In fact-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys need any help?\u201d Peter interrupted. In his experience, a back-and-forth between Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff could go on for a while.</p>\n<p>Iron Man turned to him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask that of you. But I\u2019m aware you\u2019ll probably to do it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, at least I\u2019m not so clumsy that people make embarrassing comics about me on Instagram.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose comics are wildly inaccurate,\u201d Mr. Stark said with a huff, \u201cbecause I <em>don\u2019t </em>do my own ironing. And I am not clumsy, I am graceful as a sugar plum fairy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting too old for this,\u201d Peter told him with a lazy smile.</p>\n<p>The face plate abruptly lifted and Tony Stark laid his piercing gaze on Peter. \u201cExcuse me? Say that again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that again,\u201d Natasha advised him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em>any</em> of you remember why we are here today?\u201d Rogers asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies, boss,\u201d Mr. Stark said in light tones. \u201cPlease, impart your wisdom on us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me start with a friendly reminder. We\u2019re about to go up against a woman who has great accuracy with firearms and is part robot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter felt his curiosity spike. \u201cWoah, part robot, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can fanboy over her <em>after</em> we\u2019ve caught her,\u201d Mr. Stark tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan of action, then? Have you tried taking her out with a localized electromagnetic pulse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark shuffled his feet, which looked a little ridiculous in that large suit. \u201cWe\u2019ve attempted that. It resulted mostly in embarrassment. She has a covering of conductive material surrounding her chest that blocks electromagnetic fields. So the only thing that actually stopped working when we fired off the EMP, was my own suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter fought back a snort. Oh, he should <em>definitely </em>make a comic strip about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich means that today, we\u2019re just going for a good old-fashioned punch-up,\u201d Steve Rogers said in light tones as he readjusted his shield. \u201cThere\u2019s three of us this time, so we should be able to get this wrapped up without embarrassing ourselves too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour of us.\u201d Peter corrected.</p>\n<p>Steve Rogers gave him a nod, clearly just to be polite. \u201cRight. I appreciate the offer. Why don\u2019t you\u2026 why don\u2019t you stay up here and be our eyes and ears? That\u2019s a very important job.\u201d He looked to Natasha for support.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery important,\u201d she echoed.</p>\n<p>Right. Far be it from Peter to act like a whiny teenager in front of Captain America. If he wanted to be included, he needed to show that he was responsible and could follow orders. So he just nodded.</p>\n<p>Only after the three Avengers had taken their leave \u2013 Tony Stark flying to the roof of the Fraser &amp; Co company and Romanoff and Rogers taking the stairs down to the street \u2013 did Peter realize that they hadn\u2019t even left him with a comm.</p>\n<p>Now <em>that </em>was just damn disrespectful.</p>\n<p>He sat down on the edge of the roof again with a sigh of resignation, and glanced up at the mural painting by <em>Nescio</em>. Uncle Ben looked down at him with a benevolent smile. \u201cGlad <em>you\u2019re </em>feeling cheerful, Ben,\u201d Peter muttered. \u201c\u2019<em>Be our eyes and ears\u2019, </em>they said. \u2018<em>It\u2019s an important job</em>\u2019, they said. What do they expect me to do if I actually see something dangerous? Send smoke signals?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Ben just smiled, like he always used to do when Peter was complaining. And even though it was actually just an abstract wall painting, Peter somehow still felt chastised.</p>\n<p>He waited; his legs dangling over the side of the building, and he could tell that the Robot-lady was around when he saw Iron Man suddenly jumping to attention, stepping up to the edge of the roof.</p>\n<p>Peter scanned the street, not immediately spotting their enemy until a tall figure in a long, grey raincoat caught his eye. The face was covered by the hood as she \u2013 it? \u2013 hurried down the street with long strides, a suitcase in hand.</p>\n<p>She came to a full stop when she came face to face with Natasha, who appeared out of the Fraser &amp; co\u2019s front doors and blocked her entrance. In the same moment, the Iron-Man suit fired up and Tony Stark hovered to a position right above her.</p>\n<p>Noticing him, she shrieked: the sound a strange mixture of a human cry and a fire alarm going off. She threw off her large raincoat, and <em>wow-ee</em>: Metal plates covered the right side of her face and her shoulder, a machinal eye moved independently from her natural one. Her right arm was more exposed; through the gaps in the metal, Peter could see red and blue wiring running down towards her hand.</p>\n<p>In one motion, she slammed her suitcase down against the ground and opened it, exposing what looked like a strange sort of machine that Peter would <em>really </em>like to take home and poke with a screwdriver. Robot-lady smashed her hand down on a button, then took off running.</p>\n<p>For a split second, it seemed like nothing happened at all.</p>\n<p>Then, the street lights and all the neon signs hanging over nearby shops turned off as one, like candles blown out on a birthday cake.</p>\n<p>And above Peter, in mid-air, the Iron Man suit suddenly didn\u2019t hover any more, but dropped out of the sky, tumbling towards the tarmac at alarming speed.</p>\n<p>Peter jumped forward, shooting his web. It caught the Iron Man suit on the leg, which meant that Tony was left dangling upside down, about thirty feet about the ground. But hey \u2013 he was still alive. Peter gently lowered the suit to the street where it remained, unmoving, flat on its back. Not even one tiny blinking light. She had fired off an EMP, Peter suddenly realized. <em>Of course</em>. Apparently, Robot-lady had learned from her last encounter with the Avengers. The Avengers had tried to throw her a grenade, and now she had taken the pin out and thrown it right back. Peter almost admired her.</p>\n<p>Too bad she was totally evil.</p>\n<p>Romanoff and Rogers were in pursuit, but they were hundreds of feet behind her and she was fast; shoving pedestrians out of her way and jumping across garbage cans with terrifying ease. It looked like Peter was going to have to solve this. As usual, he might add. Tony Stark was probably trapped like a sardine in a can right now, but he could wait.</p>\n<p>Peter turned and swung. He saw Robot-lady turning a corner in the distance, and he launched himself up to the roof, crossing it diagonally before diving back down towards the street, swinging from lamppost to lamppost. He was already ahead of Rogers now, and Romanoff had completely dropped out of sight with her poor normal human legs.</p>\n<p>The Robot-lady tore down the street like an out of control steamroller. She kicked a poor tree, that had apparently offended her, so hard that it snapped in half. Pedestrians gasped and ducked out of the way.</p>\n<p>Peter had almost caught up with her. He gazed ahead, mentally mapping out Robot-lady\u2019s route and his heart skipped an excited beat when he spotted a canopy above the entrance of a store, in the <em>perfect </em>position. It was dipping in the middle, where a large puddle of water had gathered. And if Robot-lady kept running in a straight line, Peter could treat her to a lovely mid-day shower, free of charge. Robots didn\u2019t generally do well with water, did they?</p>\n<p>He whooped as he swung up again, factoring in Robot-lady\u2019s speed and falling perfectly in line with her movements. And just as she disappeared under the canopy, Peter slid across the top of it, his free arm outstretched, bringing the water sloshing to the edge.</p>\n<p>The water didn\u2019t hit her perfectly; it mostly hit her on the back of the head and shoulders, not against the arm where machinery seemed most exposed.</p>\n<p>She still let out an unearthly shriek, furiously shaking her head back and forth, sending droplets flying. Something sizzled. A red spark. She stumbled forward a few more paces, suddenly looking like a baby-deer taking its first steps. But even as she went down, Peter saw her crane her neck upwards and aim the gun straight at him.</p>\n<p>There was a <em>BANG</em>, ominously reverberating against the buildings, and in the same moment Peter felt his right shoulder explode with pain.</p>\n<p>Not this again.</p>\n<p>Quickly shooting a web with his good arm, he lowered himself down to the street, gritting his teeth against the blinding pain. He glanced back to see Steve Rogers jump on top of the woman, practically spreadeagled. All pedestrians had their attention fully focused on the floundering mass of limbs on the pavement.</p>\n<p>Peter quickly ducked behind a large, triangular stone pillar that decorated the fa\u00e7ade of a fancy apartment block. Out of sight - - <em>hopefully </em>out of mind.</p>\n<p>Every single breath sent a jab of pain shooting through his chest and down his right arm. Yeah, he\u2019d taken a proper hit. He knew from long experience how to deal with gunshot wounds like this. He tried to keep his breathing as superficial as possible as he reached his left arm around and felt for an exit wound. Turned out he wasn\u2019t flexible enough to reach all the way behind his shoulder, and even trying to stretch that far hurt like a mother trucker.</p>\n<p>So he slid down to the ground, leaned back against the wall for a bit and gloomily picked at the bullet-sized hole in the front of his red-and-blue hoodie. Another suit down the drain. Or maybe he could fix it with a little patchwork.</p>\n<p>Who had ever expected that being a superhero would involve so much sewing?</p>\n<p>He was surprised to hear the whirring of repulsors. Apparently, the Iron Man suit had already recovered from the cyber-meltdown. Too bad, because Peter was in no mood for a patented Stark-lecture. The ground shook as Iron Man landed ungracefully on the pavement. Mr. Stark was always overly protective of him when they fought together. Iron Man, mother hen.</p>\n<p>The Iron Man suit moved closer. The face plate lifted, revealing Tony Stark\u2019s tight face, eyes trained on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it tickles,\u201d Peter snapped. \u201cDid I\u2026 Did I \u2014 take her down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve are we clear?\u201d Mr. Stark asked and, after listening for the answer, continued: \u201cAll right. I\u2019m with Spidey. Nat, keep the Quinjet ready, we may need to get him back to home rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNnnnope,\u201d Peter said, still focusing on keeping his breathing as shallow as possible. They were gonna have to do a lot worse to him than a simple bullet hole before Peter would consent to be taken to the Avengers\u2019 headquarters.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark stepped out of his suit and knelt beside him. \u201cYou have a gunshot wound, Underoos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks for \u2014 pointing out \u2014 the obvious.\u201d Peter grunted, slowly releasing another breath. He wasn\u2019t going to puke all over Mr. Stark\u2019s shoes again, he just <em>wasn\u2019t</em>. They were nice shoes, too. Bright red with flashy laces.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark looked annoyed. \u201cWell, apparently you\u2019re one of those people who needs the obvious pointed out to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell\u2026 just tell me \u2014 if there\u2019s an exit wound. As long as \u2014 the bullet \u2014 is not in there\u2026 I\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony Stark muttered something under his breath that definitely contained several colorful swear words and scooted closer, tugging a little at Peter\u2019s collar.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t </em>take off my mask,\u201d Peter pleaded.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark didn\u2019t respond. He just carefully peeled the red-and-blue fabric away from Peter\u2019s shoulder, one strong arm firmly around Peter waist to keep him steady, as he leaned over to glance down Peter\u2019s back. \u201cExit wound,\u201d he confirmed, and Peter exhaled in relief.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark carefully readjusted his suit and set him back against the wall. Peter only winced slightly when his injured back hit the bricks. \u201cThanks, Mr. Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Tony, kid. We\u2019re there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Tony. Um, that will be all. You can be on your way now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to leave you here, you must be concussed on top of everything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged dismissively with his one good shoulder. \u201cStay as long \u2014 as you want. But as soon as \u2014 I can stand without throwing up, I\u2019m leaving ... My aunt is a nurse ... She can fix me up when I get home ... If I\u2019m not \u2014 fully healed by then.\u201d He heaved in a slightly deeper breath. It was getting easier already; the sharp jabs of pain turning into the tingling, burning sensation that always accompanied his healing factor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour aunt knows about this, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh. Helped me dig the bullet out this one time when I <em>didn\u2019t </em>have an exit wound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are one tough motherfucker,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>Language, young man!\u201d Peter scolded.</p>\n<p>Tony snorted.</p>\n<p>Peter laid his head back against the wall. \u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFor not, uh\u2026 That is\u2026 I figured you\u2019d use this as an excuse to take a peek under the mask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s in my own best interest to keep your identity a secret, Underoos,\u201d Tony said. \u201cJudging by your size and voice you\u2019re \u2013 rough estimate \u2013 twelve years old. You\u2019re a kid playing an adult game, and I don\u2019t need that on my conscience. But as long as you keep the mask on, I can pretend that I don\u2019t know how young you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me very much, I\u2019m <em>fifteen</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making the compelling case you think you are. Let me take you home, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lifted his head again to study Tony through his goggles. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not gonna happen, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Tony, I don\u2019t have a death wish, okay? So if I thought the situation was bad, I\u2019d ask for help. But I\u2019ve been through this particular mill a hundred times already. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Peter sat up straighter and, when he wasn\u2019t overcome with a wave of nausea, carefully pushed himself to his feet.</p>\n<p>Tony stood up too, still frowning deeply. But all Peter did was give him a little wave and say \u201ctell Captain \u2018<em>you\u2019re welcome</em>\u2019 for me, and maybe to actually work <em>with </em>me next time, and I\u2019ll see ya when I see ya,\u201d before shuffling around him and into the sunlight.</p>\n<p>And Iron Man probably thought Peter didn\u2019t notice him following; didn\u2019t <em>feel </em>Tony Stark\u2019s eyes on him from somewhere overhead as he walked home. As soon as he could, Peter ducked into an alleyway and managed to escape him.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Spider-Man might be a \u2018tough motherfucker\u2019, but Peter Parker sometimes needed help.</p>\n<p>For instance, when he was handing another steaming cup of coffee to Jennie, a shy but sweet homeless lady with a troubled past who came to the caf\u00e9 almost every Saturday, and suddenly Don popped up next to the table, distrust and suspicion written all over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you happy with your order, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked, his voice laced with a false sincerity, eyes trained on Jennie like a shark who had smelled blood in the water.</p>\n<p>Jennie stared up at him like a dear caught in headlights, nodding quickly in spite of her clear panic, and there was a small chance that Peter was <em>definitely</em> about to get fired.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd will you be paying in cash or by credit card, ma\u2019am?\u201d Don asked, going in for the kill.</p>\n<p>Jennie threw Peter a helpless glance, then ducked her head, almost disappearing inside the giant scarf. Peter held his breath, clenching his tray tight, grasping for some kind of excuse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Don demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a voice said.</p>\n<p>Tony Stark really had a knack of turning up at the worst moments. Peter turned, wondering if this situation was about to get better or much, much worse. Tony was standing behind them in a nice looking suit. He was wearing those same bright red shoes. His eyes drifted from Don\u2019s set jaw, to Jennie, to Peter\u2019s nervous face. He didn\u2019t say anything else, yet.</p>\n<p>Don did a double take, then blinked. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Tony finally spoke, as if he had waited for Don to start just so he could interrupt him. \u201cI certainly hope you are not accosting my business partner, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Don floundered for a moment. \u201cBusiness partner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony said. \u201dThis is Mrs. Flanigan, head of NYU Tandon school of engineering. Problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>Don glanced at Jennie\u2019s oversized coat and dirty nails. Jennie puffed out her chest a little, holding his gaze this time. \u201cNo problem,\u201d Don said in his most oily voice. \u201cI\u2019m honored to receive you in my establishment, Iron Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, you have excellent staff,\u201d Tony said, with a single pat on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello T-\u2026 Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter said, catching himself just in time. Tony had only allowed Spider-Man to get to a first-name basis, after all. \u201cI like your shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do. They\u2019re the height of fashion,\u201d Tony said with a grin. \u201cThey\u2019re so cool, you could store tubs of ice cream in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Don glanced between Tony and Peter for a moment, lips pursed in aversion. Anyone who talked to Peter like a normal human being, would clearly never be a friend of Don. But the man apparently had enough braincells left to not challenge Tony Stark directly. So instead, he just dumped a few more insults on Peter. \u201cI didn\u2019t hire you to stand around. Maybe actually get your lazy ass to work for a change; you have a line of customers at the counter.\u201d He turned his back on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Peter mumbled, deciding not to point out that the line was there because Don had felt the need to check up on him in the first place.</p>\n<p>Tony gave him an incredulous look, and as soon as Don was out of earshot, he mimicked: \u201c<em>Yes, sir</em>. Why the hell are you letting that guy walk all over you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter released a breath, so long that it felt as though he had been holding it through the whole conversation. \u201cThank you, Mr. Stark,\u201d he said, fully aware that Tony just saved his job.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome, squirt,\u201d the man said, turning to Jennie with a slight bow as he gestured at the chair. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>She blinked, then shrugged her consent.</p>\n<p>Tony sat down at the table with her, languidly leaning back and grinning up at Peter. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get me and my business partner some donuts?\u201d he took off his sunglasses and pointed them at Jennie. \u201cYou like banana and cinnamon, Mrs. Flanigan?\u201d</p>\n<p>She narrowed her eyes, gauging his expression for a moment. \u201cChocolate raspberry,\u201d she then said.</p>\n<p>Tony nodded. \u201cExcellent choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter returned to the counter, head still reeling. Tony had saved his ass for now, but Peter knew this wasn\u2019t the end of it. Maybe Don had seen Jennie at the caf\u00e9 before and had been suspicious of her already. Either way, Peter really needed to be more careful with the free coffee, because Don would probably be watching him for a while.</p>\n<p>He took a few more orders, then paused for a moment behind the counter to massage his shoulder. His muscles always did feel a bit sore the day after he\u2019d gotten shot or stabbed. He had made it back home just fine last night. His wound had already closed nicely by then, so May couldn\u2019t fuss over him like she always wanted to. Instead, she had clucked her tongue a bit when she saw his bloodied and shot apart hoodie and set about washing out the worst stains with hot water and soap. Peter had told her to forget it, that he was going to throw it out and make himself a new one, but May had insisted that it needed to be cleaned first to avoid questions from the neighbors (\u201cDidn\u2019t we watch 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' together? Don\u2019t you know any one of our neighbors could be a secret spy?\u201d).</p>\n<p>He made Tony a cup of coffee and then brought the odd couple their donuts. Tony appeared to have no problem keeping up a conversation with a homeless woman; their current topic of conversation was business relations, and Jennie apparently had plenty of advice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about image,\u201d Tony was saying. \u201cI just need to get those people to <em>like </em>me, somehow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can steal their stuff and then pretend you found them under a garbage can,\u201d Jennie said.</p>\n<p>A wicked light entered Tony\u2019s eyes. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t want to know what schemes they were hatching, but there was something heartwarming about the simple fact that Tony Stark had actually sat down with Jennie \u2013 and he didn\u2019t even look at her all superior and condescending. Peter already knew that there <em>was </em>something resembling a kind person beneath all those carefully constructed layers of cynicism and snark, but it was always pleasant to see a reminder.</p>\n<p>He set the donuts down, before clenching the tray against his chest. \u201cYou should probably not come by during the day for a few weeks,\u201d he told Jennie, forcing down that little bubble of guilt. \u201cLay low for a little while. But you can drop by around closing time, because Don has usually long left by then, and I always close up by myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to quit this job,\u201d Tony said with a frown as he reached for his donut. \u201cThat asshole is abusive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter squeaked. \u201cNo sir, he doesn\u2019t\u2026 he never\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that. Verbally abusive, not to mention exploitative. How old are you, thirteen? Are you even allowed to work this many hours? Working overtime while he just goes home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me very much, I\u2019m <em>fifteen</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gave a dramatic sigh, waving his donut around. \u201cGod, if I had a penny for every time I heard some kid say <em>that </em>as if it would actually make a damn difference\u2026 well, I\u2019d have two pennies. Quit you job, squirt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for you insight, Mr. Stark, but some of us aren\u2019t billionaires who can spend their days snorting caviar and bathing in champagne.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like someone has been reading my diary,\u201d Tony said, wiggling his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Peter just frowned at him. He didn\u2019t want to be snarky at Tony, but the man\u2019s \u2018nothing matters\u2019-attitude annoyed him. \u201cI need this job, it\u2019s my safety net.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a job,\u201d Tony offered. \u201cThe tower has a restaurant where you can work. Several, in fact. I\u2019ll double whatever that asshole pays you, and you won\u2019t have to do unpaid overtime. <em>Mi casa es su </em>safety net.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter breathed out, now feeling guilty about snapping. Tony\u2019s frame of reference might be a little detached from reality, with his mindboggling state of wealth and fame, but he was always kind to Peter and he <em>had </em>just saved him from Don\u2019s wrath. \u201cThank you sir, but I don\u2019t <em>want </em>to quit,\u201d he explained. \u201cI really like this job. I mean \u2013 not the owner, or the hours, or the pay. But I like the customers. They know me, they come here to talk to me, to get free coffee when they need it.\u201d He threw a quick glance at Jennie. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ditch them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a breathy voice interrupted them. A young man had appeared next to the booth; early twenties, wobbling nervously on his feet. \u201cSir, I\u2019m such a big fan. Can I\u2026 Can we get a selfie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s mouth snapped shut. He threw Peter a calculating look that seemed to imply that Peter had not heard the last of his \u2018quit your job\u2019-rant, but then turned his attention to the young man. \u201cBig fan, huh? What\u2019s my favorite color?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man blinked. \u201cYour\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust making sure you\u2019re not one of those fake fans who only started liking me <em>after </em>I saved the planet from aliens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh\u2026 red and gold?\u201d The man ventured.</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky guess,\u201d Tony said. \u201cGet in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a undignified squeal, the man got his selfie before bouncing off, back to his own table. A few other customers had turned their heads, too, comprehension dawning in their eyes as they took a good look at Mr. Stark.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d better leave,\u201d Tony murmured, taking out his wallet and pushing some money into Peter\u2019s hand without even looking how much it was. \u201cThat\u2019s to cover everything. Keep the change.\u201d He rose from his chair and bowed at Jennie again. \u201cGoodbye Mrs Flanigan, thank you for the interesting, fierce and \u2013 I think \u2013 productive debate on establishing long-term working relationships.\u201d He left.</p>\n<p>\u201cGosh,\u201d Jennie said as she happily dunked a piece of donut into her coffee. \u201cCan you believe Tony Stark thought I was the head of some university?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part I: Anthony Edward</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony Stark was in his element.</p>\n<p>Making vague threats to incompetent assholes was easily in the top 10 of his favorite pastimes. He had even put on his big, flashy \u2018evil businessman\u2019-watch for the occasion, even though he was speaking on the phone and his current victim couldn\u2019t see him. Still, he felt that dressing the part made you feel the part, and feeling the part made your voice sound all the more intimidating. \u201cMy friend; if the government finds out you are breaking federal labor laws on this scale, you\u2019ll go to jail. And I mean straight to jail. Do not pass go, do not collect five hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re implying!\u201d Don barked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sure you do, you human-shaped turd. I\u2019ve been to your caf\u00e9. You pay below minimum wage, you violate the permitted working hours for minors. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p>\n<p>Don grumbled a little on the other side of the line, before grunting: \u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony lazily rested his arm on the desk, gazing down at his \u2018evil businessman\u2019-watch. \u201cI want you to sell me your caf\u00e9. Stat.\u201d</p>\n<p>This definitely seemed like a good idea.</p>\n<p>Don sputtered and objected and cursed a blue streak and made a whole array of increasingly unimpressive threats, but as always, Tony got what he wanted in the end. He even offered Don a decent prize, which was certainly more than the man deserved.</p>\n<p>After he hung up, he made his way to Pepper\u2019s office. He found her sitting cross-legged on top of her desk, twirling a pen in her fingers as she read a contract. She looked more relaxed than usual, and Tony felt a little bad about ruining her good mood with what he was about to tell her. \u201cHoney? I bought a caf\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowned, not looking up from the contract yet. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lovely little place somewhere in Queens. Got rid of the current proprietor, effective immediately. So it would be nice if we could find someone else to run it, like <em>today</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper carefully laid her pen down, although Tony somehow got the impression she was resisting the urge to fling it at his head. \u201cHave you gone mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe jury is still out.\u201d</p>\n<p>She slipped off the desk, sat down in her desk chair and crossed her arms. \u201cDo you have any idea how many FDA regulations are involved with owning a food business? Regulations that we have no expertise on whatsoever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that far ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should have that tattooed on your forehead. What\u2019s the story here? Why a caf\u00e9? Is it like that time you bought an island because you thought it was shaped like E.T.?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said, shuffling his feet and bringing up a hand to scratch the back of his head. Pepper always had a way of making him feel like a clueless school boy. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026. There\u2019s this kid. You know, the one I told you about a few times. And \u2013 uhm \u2013 he likes working there, but he doesn\u2019t like the owner. So I\u2019m rectifying that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper\u2019s eyes scrutinized him quietly. There was no annoyance in her gaze anymore, just a questioning glance. \u201cAnd who exactly do you suggest I hire to operate this caf\u00e9 for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Someone who is good with kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone who is good with kids,\u201d Pepper repeated. \u201cNot someone who is a good barista, or someone with a knack for business?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes. That too, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking her head in exasperation, Pepper turned in her seat to grab a piece of paper and a pen. She started writing out a list, and Tony couldn\u2019t really make out what it was. You\u2019d think someone as orderly as Pepper would have exemplary handwriting, but in reality it was nothing more than an illegible scrawl. \u201cWhatcha writing there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA letter to Human Resources, complaining about you,\u201d she quipped without missing a beat.</p>\n<p>\u201cPep!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust leave it with me for a moment, Tony. I\u2019ll get your caf\u00e9 all sorted out before lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m going crazy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you get caught up in far, far more insane projects. In fact, this particular bout of lunacy doesn\u2019t even crack the top ten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fair enough. \u201cJust make sure you double the kid\u2019s salary, okay? And whoever else works there, too. And maybe set up something like a \u2018pay it forward\u2019 type of program where we pay for homeless people\u2019s coffee. And change the name to something clever. Oh \u2013 and make sure to put in some new booths that are kinda secluded \u2013 you know, so famous people can sit there without getting bothered by the GP.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to quit your job at Stark Industries and just run this caf\u00e9?\u201d She asked, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Actually \u2013 don\u2019t tell the employees I\u2019m the new owner, would you? I think it might freak the kid out. Use a pseudonym or something.\u00a0 Let\u2019s call him\u2026 Anthony. Anthony Edward.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>For some reason, Clint had made it his personal mission to keep Tony up to date on the most embarrassing and offensive pictures he could dredge up from the social media swamp. And his new favorite supplier was some Instagram asshole called \u2018moon monkey\u2019 or something like that.</p>\n<p>Clint always chose the worst moments to bother him with them, too. When they were in the middle of a mission. Or when it was five AM and Tony had finally drifted off to sleep. Or when he was walking down the halls of a hospital.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tones. NightMonkey uploaded another one of you. Pepper says it\u2019s both hilarious and accurate. Shall I forward it to you right away, or do you prefer to wait until you get home so I can walk you through it?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony stared down at his phone, not sure if he wanted to roll his eyes or scream in frustration.</p>\n<p><em>Hey Cupid\u2019s weird cousin,</em> he messaged back, <em>I\u2019m in a children\u2019s hospital. Do you really want to be responsible for putting me in a bad mood while I have a meet and greet with young leukemia patients?</em></p>\n<p>His phone stayed quiet for a few seconds. <em>All right, </em>Clint then replied. <em>In person it is. I\u2019ll be waiting for you, boo-boo &lt;3</em></p>\n<p>Just wonderful.</p>\n<p>He put his phone away and redirected his attention to Erin, one of his PR managers. No-nonsense, hardworking Erin, who had never demonstrated even the slightest evidence of a sense of humor. Bless her heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBarton keeps insisting I look at some idiotic comics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, readjusting her glasses. \u201cThe ones from NightMonkey that he keeps reposting? Ya, they\u2019re pretty funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Et tu, </em>Erin?\u201d</p>\n<p>She cracked a smile, the first one he had ever seen on her, and then gestured for him to enter the room behind her. A room that would be full of young cancer patients who all wanted Iron Man to read them a story.</p>\n<p>And those little buggers were probably all on Instagram; every last one of them. One of them might even <em>be </em>NightMonkey.</p>\n<p>Tony liked to imagine that these kids somehow had the upper hand over him. It made him feel just slightly less inadequate about being completely unable to save them. Slightly less paranoid that every doctor and nurse who glanced his way was secretly thinking \u2018<em>I saved just as many lives as you did, Mr. Avenger. Where is <u>my</u> medal?\u2019</em></p>\n<p>He entered the room, where a nurse was helping five kids settle into a pile of large pillows on the floor, in front of a large armchair where Tony was clearly supposed to sit. The set-up made him think of those mall Santas he only really knew from TV.</p>\n<p>He recognized the nurse as Peter\u2019s aunt, May Parker. Funny. It seemed weird to start a whole conversation right now, though, so he simply gave her a polite nod. Her returning smile was friendly but professional and no recognition shimmered in her eyes. Had she forgotten about meeting him?</p>\n<p>That was definitely impossible.</p>\n<p>On the other hand; the day they met, her attention had mostly been focused on hoisting her wan, semi-lifeless nephew into the backseat of her car, while rattling off a lecture about the dangers of marshmallows. (\u201cDid we <em>not </em>watch Ghostbusters together? Don\u2019t you know those things can gang up on you?\u201d)</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t dwell on the thought, though, because May had already left the room and someone pushed a picture book into his hands and now five pairs of wide, curious eyes were staring back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore we begin,\u201d he said. \u201cAny of you people on Instagram?\u201d</p>\n<p>All five hands lifted.</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain to me the appeal of this cheap Facebook knock-off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Facebook?\u201d a girl asked, her face scrunched up in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Instagram for old people,\u201d a boy whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d the girl said, with an understanding nod. \u201cSo we have to switch to Facebook when we get old?\u201d She had the gall to wave her hand in Tony\u2019s direction at the word \u2018old\u2019.</p>\n<p>The boy considered her question for a while. \u201cProbably,\u201d he then said.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just read,\u201d Tony decided.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony supposed the universe was trying to tell him something when he stepped out onto the sidewalk an hour later and saw May Parker right outside the door, zipping up her coat, a backpack clenched between her legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>She jolted, turned and stared back at him with surprised eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony Stark,\u201d Tony said, pointing a thumb at his own chest. \u201cWe met that day when your nephew threw up all over my shoes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect <em>you</em> to.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was funny how often people were surprised that Tony remembered their names. Apparently, he was supposed to be a bigger asshole or something. \u201cI\u2019m a genius,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t forget your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cYou remind me of Peter. I see why he likes you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Tony asked, conversationally.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill alive, I hope,\u201d May said, a little shortly. She hoisted up her bag. Hesitated. \u201cI apologize, Mr. Stark. It\u2019s\u2026 I just ended a double shift. I\u2019m starving, sweaty, exhausted and I really want to get home to my nephew to make sure he hasn\u2019t gotten himself into any trouble today. And the bus is leaving in five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me drive you home,\u201d Tony offered. \u201cI\u2019m parked right around the corner. And it\u2019s on my way.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t. And she probably knew it wasn\u2019t. But she smiled gratefully, accepted the offer and followed him to his car.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill me in this thing, I assume?\u201d she asked as she put on her seatbelt.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an excellent driver. I only hit <em>one </em>cone on my way here. It jumped in front of my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hummed. \u201cDo you have a tiny red button, like the car in Men In Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about a flux capacitor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony was beginning to see why Peter had turned out so well. \u201cNo. But I have <em>this</em>.\u201d He pressed a button and a shiny blob appeared above the dashboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a holographic bobblehead dog?\u201d May asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>is </em>a holographic bobblehead dog,\u201d Tony confirmed. \u201cAnd he bobbles when the car moves. Watch.\u201d He demonstrated by bouncing up and down in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d May asked, \u201cdoes it exist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I made it. I wondered if I could and, as always, the answer was \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you ever wonder if you could make a flux capacitor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d Tony started the car and pulled out of the parking space. The dog\u2019s bobblehead veered to the left. \u201cSo, you work a lot of double shifts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve met my nephew. He\u2019ll be off to college before you know it. Knowing him, an expensive one. That boy can\u2019t stop getting straight A\u2019s.\u201d She made her voice sound exasperated, but the look of sheer pride in her eyes gave her away. \u201cSo I\u2019m making sure we have the money in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour husband\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shook her head. Tony knew not to ask any further. \u201cThe kid might get a scholarship,\u201d he suggested. Because getting straight A\u2019s at a STEM school? Not exactly plain sailing. More like sailing through a hurricane on a raft made of cheese. The French type of cheese that breaks apart if you even look at it too hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe might,\u201d she agreed, settling into her seat and closing her eyes. \u201cI think he\u2019s aiming for one. But I don\u2019t want him to feel like he <em>needs </em>one. I don\u2019t want him to feel like his only shot at getting into a good university is by getting the scholarship, because he has plenty of responsibilities on his shoulders already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hummed non-committally.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you think about those emails he sent you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat emails?\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowned without opening her eyes. \u201cYour research about solar \u2013 something. Sunbeds? No \u2013 surely that wasn\u2019t it. Either way, he read something on your website and wanted to email you about it. He was pretty excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSolar distillation. Huh. I don\u2019t remember receiving an email, but those usually get filtered out at the Front Office. For an email to make it to <em>me </em>it has to do whatever is the email equivalent of climbing Mount Everest on stilts. Peter hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you publish the research, yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Some scientist I had never heard off sent me a few notes that were interesting, so I\u2019m pretty much reworking the whole thing. I\u2019ll talk to Peter about it, Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>She opened her eyes and smiled. \u201cWere you planning to visit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI drop by the caf\u00e9 now and then. To keep him out of trouble. Kinda like a \u2026 parole officer meets guardian angel. I was there last weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me. I hope you <em>will </em>see him this weekend because Peter, for one, is pretty sure that he is about to lose his job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony frowned. That couldn\u2019t be right. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. Something about a sudden change in ownership this week. Peter got an email about it. It just said that they would sign his new contract on Saturday, but I think he\u2019s wary that there\u2019s a catch. They renamed the caf\u00e9 GoaTea. Tea, like T-E-A \u00a0tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll get a discount because I <em>have </em>a goatee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot,\u201d she judged.</p>\n<p>When a short silence fell, FRIDAY jumped into the conversation. \u201cBoss. Mr. Barton would like to know your ETA. He has an urgent matter to discuss with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis urgent matter had better not include the word \u2018night\u2019 or \u2018monkey\u2019,\u201d Tony warned.</p>\n<p>A stifled laugh escaped May. Tony glanced aside to see her press her hand against her lips. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said a little too quickly, her eyes sparkling with mirth.</p>\n<p>Tony groaned. \u201cYou <em>saw </em>those comics, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The half guilty, half mischievous look on her face said it all. \u201cI\u2019m sure whoever made them is really just a big fan,\u201d she assured him. \u201cYou know, mockery is the sincerest form of flattery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 <em>not </em>the saying, Miss Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>They reached the front door to May\u2019s apartment block about fifteen minutes later. It turned out, Peter lived just down the street from the caf\u00e9 where he worked \u2013 the caf\u00e9 Tony now owned. The fa\u00e7ade had been repainted. Large letters above the door spelled out \u2018GoaTea\u2019.</p>\n<p>May opened the car door, then paused for a moment. \u201cDo you want to come in for coffee or something? Say hello to Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Tell him I\u2019ll see him Saturday. And, uh, tell him not to worry about that job. I have a good feeling about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part II: Maria Howard</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper, what I\u2019m about to suggest might upset you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper responded with all the dignity and grace you could expect from a Stark CEO: she blew a raspberry at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only our board members knew what you were like behind closed doors,\u201d Tony lamented, leaning against her office door. \u201cThey\u2019d have so much more respect for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sat forward in her chair. \u201cJust lay it on me, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony cleared his throat and took a seat, too. \u201cYou remember the kid from the caf\u00e9?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Parker,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s signing his new contract today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. \u2013 <em>Did </em>you double his salary?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTripled it, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cGood. Good.\u201d</p>\n<p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cSpit it out, Tony. What \u2013 you want to adopt him? Clone him? Make him the sole heir of Stark Industries?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll in good time,\u201d Tony said with a half-smile. \u201cFor now, I wanted to set up a college fund for him. I met his aunt at the children\u2019s hospital this week. Real good, hardworking woman. They certainly aren't living the high life. And the kid\u2019s supposed to be smart. I mean, he never really <em>seems </em>that smart when I talk to him, but I guess I never really seem smart when I talk to <em>you</em>, so who am I to judge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper cracked a smile at that. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she said. \u201cOver Christmas, I came home to find a donkey in our living room and you didn\u2019t even bat an eyelid; but you want to do something as simple as set up a college fund, and you get all bashful about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She had a point. Tony frowned down at his hands as he tried to figure out why he felt so strangely self-conscious about his latest crusade. \u201cWell the donkey was\u2026 First off, in my defense, I thought it was a reindeer -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a great defense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c- and I just wanted to bring about that real Christmas spirit. While this thing is\u2026 To be honest, I don\u2019t really know what this thing is, and I suppose that makes me apprehensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re troubled by your ability to care about another human being,\u201d Pepper deducted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstute, if a trifle harsh. I\u2019ve just been in a strange mood lately, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d she said in a gentle voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in a strange mood for as long as I\u2019ve known you. So would you like me to set this up through MIT?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony immediately said, because he <em>had </em>actually thought this part through. \u201cHe\u2019s only fifteen. I don\u2019t want to limit his options in picking the university <em>he </em>wants. Can you contact Mrs. Whatshername over at Global Scholarship Grants? And let\u2019s make sure to do this anonymously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper gave him a long look at that, her head slightly cocked, as if she wasn\u2019t looking at Tony, but at one of his abstract paintings that she wanted to figure out. \u201cYou should introduce me to the kid sometime,\u201d she then said as she turned and opened her laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how much your life revolves around him. And you don\u2019t even want him to know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m some creepy stalker,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause secretly pulling the strings in a kid\u2019s life from behind the scenes <em>isn\u2019t </em>creepy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about <em>being </em>creepy. I just don\u2019t want him to <em>think </em>I\u2019m creepy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoken in true Tony Stark fashion. So the donation won\u2019t be in your name, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Let\u2019s call him\u2026 let\u2019s call <em>her</em>\u2026 Mrs. Maria Howard.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony didn\u2019t often use the term \u2018perfect\u2019 for anything, but the new, secluded booths in the back of GoaTea were damn close. A row of plants shielded him from the rest of the caf\u00e9. He could spy on everyone else, but no-one could see him.</p>\n<p>Arguably the best way to be in public.</p>\n<p>Today, he was particularly fascinated by a stoic-faced girl, Peter\u2019s age, who sat in a booth near the window. Peter\u2019s awkwardness seemed to skyrocket around her, which was interesting, because Tony thought he had already seen Peter at his most embarrassed.</p>\n<p>She had ordered a milkshake and was casually sipping at it as her dark eyes constantly followed Peter around the caf\u00e9. Judging from the slight blush on Peter\u2019s face as he took orders, he was aware of the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Peter arrived at his table with a notepad and a lopsided grin. \u201cHi, Mr. Stark. MJ says there\u2019s a creep staring at her from behind the bushes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe Tony wasn\u2019t as completely hidden as he had thought. \u201cSorry. That your girlfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? I mean \u2013 maybe. Uhhh\u2026 I mean yes.\u201d Peter visibly cringed at his own awkwardness. \u201c<em>YES</em>. God, please don\u2019t tell her I said \u2018maybe\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>This kid was more amusing to watch than most late night TV hosts.</p>\n<p>Tony glanced towards the matronly woman behind the counter that Pepper had apparently hired. \u201cWhat about her? She\u2019s new.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Don left. Super of the blue. I mean \u2013 it\u2019s a not a surprise, he didn\u2019t seem like he <em>enjoyed </em>his job. But still. And now Laura is kind of running things around here. She\u2019s cool. And I\u2019m actually getting paid properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might be,\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cJust wary about what\u2019s going to happen next. Waiting for Parker luck to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Parker luck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kind of luck that has you mistake a billionaire for a homeless guy and then throw up on his shoes. Coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Hey - your aunt said something about you emailing me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Peter said, tearing his eyes away from his notepad.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout my research on solar distillation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013 the\u2026 yeah, the solar distillation,\u201d Peter said, once again blushing. Honestly, he might as well just paint his cheeks red at this point. He already seemed to be almost permanently in a state of embarrassment, anyway. \u201cThat\u2026 That was nothing. Did you publish it, yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>If only. Tony had been ready to get his work published when a certain Dr. Parker Benjamin emailed him out of nowhere with a whole array of insightful comments and interesting ideas that would significantly improve his research project.</p>\n<p>It was all kinds of terrible.</p>\n<p>He had sent Mr. Benjamin a simple reply: <em>Was interested to read your notes and would like to include them in my paper. All with due credit, of course. Can we hop on the phone? \u2013Tony Stark.</em></p>\n<p>The response had been nothing but a deafening silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m close to publishing it. Just trying to include some new comments I received recently, but the person who sent me the comments is not responding to my email.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter suddenly smacked himself on the forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn. I mean \u2013 nothing,\u201d Peter said. \u201cJust realized I forgot something, but it has nothing to do with this. Go on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll wait a few more days and then I'll use other methods to trace him down. Maybe show up at his doorstep unannounced.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, uhuh, sounds good. Let me get your coffee,\u201d Peter said, before rushing away.</p>\n<p>Tony leaned back in his seat and grabbed a menu to study it. Pepper had really outdone herself. Or maybe this was all Laura\u2019s work. Judging by the extensive list of lunch options, she was a stellar cook. The pesto tortellini pasta salad looked particularly good.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the menu was a tiny, framed message. <em>For every 20 cups of coffee sold, GoaTea donates one free cup of coffee to the homeless.</em></p>\n<p>Cute.</p>\n<p>Humming under his breath, he took out his laptop and opened it. Why not do a little work in the caf\u00e9 that he officially owned? He had noticed the endless supply of young men and women, sitting around at caf\u00e9s with their laptops and their mocha latt\u00e9s and their hippie sweaters and their overly large glasses. It was high time to see what all the fuss was about.</p>\n<p>His phone chimed.</p>\n<p>Wow. Speaking of the devil. He had received an email from Parker Benjamin. <em>Hello Mr. Tony Stark mister Iron Man sir, </em>it read. <em>No need to credit me, just use the notes in your paper as you see fit. -P. Benjamin.</em></p>\n<p>Tony frowned down at his phone. What the hell? He tapped the reply button. <em>Not acceptable. </em>He wrote. <em>All contributions merit authorship credit. </em>He hesitated for a moment as he considered what else to write. He didn\u2019t understand why this was such a big deal. It wasn\u2019t as if they were exposing state secrets. <em>Just let me include your name, university and field of research. </em>He activated voice command on his laptop. \u201cFRIDAY, find a Dr. Parker Benjamin, US based, who specializes in the field of clean energy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProcessing. Stand by,\u201d FRIDAY said, before reporting: \u201cNo results found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCanada based? UK, Australia?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmong closest hits are a Dr. Benjamin Perker working at the Clean Energy Technology Network in Missouri, or the Irish Dr. Caroline Parker-Benjamin specializing in mesoporous materials for clean energy technologies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spectacular.</p>\n<p>He put his phone down on the table with a sigh, leaned back and surveyed his surroundings for a while. Peter was sitting with MJ, both of them peering intently at the screen of his phone.</p>\n<p><em>Probably on Instagram, </em>Tony thought, a little chagrinned.</p>\n<p>Peter jumped up when Laura slid a cup of coffee across the counter, and left his phone in the hands of his girlfriend as he grabbed the order.</p>\n<p>Tony waved his phone in the kid\u2019s face as soon as he was close enough. \u201cFIRDAY can\u2019t find a Dr. Benjamin anywhere. I think it might be a fake name!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Peter said, carefully setting the cup down. \u201cWould you like something to eat, too? They took donuts off the menu, but we got a great selection of muffins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBanana cinnamon?\u201d Tony asked. He dropped his eyes back down to his phone when it chimed again. He sat up. \u201cWhadduya know. Dr. Benjamin replied again. He\u2019s awfully talkative, suddenly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony opened the email and read out loud: \u201c<em>Listen, Inspector Gadget, it\u2019s not hard: either include my notes or don\u2019t. Now leave me alone. </em>- - Well that\u2019s just rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>is </em>rude,\u201d Peter said, his eyes flashing. \u201cLet me go get you that muffin.\u201d</p>\n<p>He marched back to the counter and, inexplicably, punched his girlfriend in the shoulder on his way. She sent him a lazy smirk in return, then turned her gaze towards the plants Tony was hiding behind. Tony quickly dropped his eyes down to the screen of his laptop.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t help. She came over anyway.</p>\n<p>The table wobbled as she sat down in the booth opposite him. She set her milkshake down between them like it was a recording device, and gave him a hard, long stare. Then, she began her interrogation with: \u201cSo what\u2019s your deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you hanging out at this caf\u00e9 when I\u2019m sure you have around seven private restaurants of your own, one for every day of the week?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like to be among the people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re hiding behind these plants like a flasher waiting for his moment to shine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch\u00e9. So, you\u2019re Peter\u2019s girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s my boy. Don\u2019t change the subject. Why are you hanging around here? It\u2019s not because you\u2026\u201d she slowly swayed her head back and forth a little, \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t know; know certain things you\u2019re pretending not to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony leaned forward and rested his chin in one hand as he intently stared back at her. \u201cLike what?\u201d Was this girl implying she knew he was the new owner of this caf\u00e9? No, she couldn\u2019t possibly. This secret identity thing was already making him paranoid. He wondered how Spider-Man did it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, bringing the straw of the milkshake to her lips again. \u201cSurprise me. What\u2019s the biggest secret you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assure you that not one of my top ten biggest secrets has anything to do with this caf\u00e9.\u201d Big fat lie. \u201cOr with Mr. Parker himself.\u201d Even bigger, fatter lie. \u201cBut I am enjoying this GDR-style interrogation.\u201d That one was partially true. She was amusing, if somewhat mystifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go, Mrs. Albasiny,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice sounded. \u201cI\u2019m going to put the two of you right here so you can keep an eye on MJ over there. She\u2019s trouble.\u201d Balancing a tray on one hand, he used his free arm to guide two elderly ladies to a booth near Tony\u2019s one, sending him an apologetic grin on the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013 are you two a couple? Oooh, that\u2019s <em>adoooorable</em>!\u201d One lady said as she sagged into her seat. \u201cShe\u2019s such a pretty little lady!\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time, MJ looked slightly awkward. \u201cDon\u2019t set old ladies on me, Parker,\u201d she quietly hissed when Peter came over to set a muffin down in front of Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother my customers, Jones,\u201d Peter shot back, pointing his thumb at Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just bet Peter is a <em>wonderfully </em>romantic young man,\u201d the other lady said loudly as she unfolded a napkin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d MJ proclaimed, leaning over to look at them. \u201cHe broke off our first ever kiss because he needed to check his Instagram.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not on Instagram, <em>you\u2019re </em>on Instagram!\u201d Peter blurted as his eyes widened with unexplained panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cSettle down, Beavis,\u201d MJ muttered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part III: Nescio</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spider-Man was exactly where Tony expected him to be: lounging on top of Queens children\u2019s hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho let you up here?\u201d Spider-Man asked when he caught sight of the two Avengers approaching him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the hospital staff treat Steve and myself as one of the family,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWe\u2019re always here. Reading to sick kids, cashing in karma points.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch benefactors,\u201d Spider-Man said. He got to his feet. \u201cAre we going to fight a half-robot again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shenanigans today,\u201d Tony said, waving at Rogers and himself as a way to point out that they were not dressed for a mission. \u201cTake a day off, Ferris Bueller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you both here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I made some tech I want to share with you,\u201d Tony said, before jerking his head at Steve. \u201cRogers is here because he likes to feel relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here because I have a proposition from the Avengers,\u201d Steve said with a half-smile. \u201cStark is here because he\u2019s a bit of a control-freak when it comes to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Spider-Man said, his voice full of anticipation. \u201cWhat proposition?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony delved into an inner pocket and took out the smartwatch he had finished developing this morning. He held it out to Spider-Man.</p>\n<p>There was some hesitation in the kid\u2019s movements as he stepped forward to take it. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA way to call for help. If you ever run into any trouble, if you ever get hurt and you need back-up, you can activate it. There is a panic button that\u2019s directly connected to our headquarters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it also a way to track me?\u201d Spider-Man asked sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wanted to know who you are and where you live, believe me, I\u2019d already know it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019d run an algorithm on Spider-Man\u2019s behavior, predict the location of your domicile with an accuracy of 72 percent, obtain security footage from all cameras in that area, run facial recognition and juxtapose the results against the times and places of Spider-Man sightings and <em>KAPLOW</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s \u2026 oddly specific.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony waved a hand. \u201cI think I already made it clear last time that I feel much more comfortable <em>not </em>knowing who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man looked down again, and ran his fingers along the edges of the watch. \u201cIt is useful, I suppose. If there\u2019s a major Avengers-level threat going down, and you need my help, you can reach me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be used for that,\u201d Steve warned him. \u201cWe\u2019re simply giving <em>you </em>a way to ask for help when you need it. For us to help you; not the other way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man lowered the watch, his whole posture suddenly screaming resentment. \u201cSo \u2013 what, you\u2019re essentially giving me a baby monitor? Think I can\u2019t hold my own out here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with that, son,\u201d Steve said, hesitating. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing, and you can handle a fight, I\u2019ve seen that. But I don\u2019t want to shoulder the responsibility of\u2026 well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man\u2019s shoulders slumped in resignation. \u201cYou think I\u2019m twelve years old, <em>too</em>, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told Tony it was fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man turned his head to Tony, who could practically <em>feel </em>the glare, although it was hardly impressive from behind those stupid swimming goggles. \u201cWhat?\u201d Tony said. \u201cWas that a state secret?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it was <em>our </em>secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute. I don\u2019t even know your name, but we\u2019re sharing secrets now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust keep that,\u201d Steve said, with a nod at the watch. \u201cWhether you use it is up to you. But at least you\u2019ll <em>have </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Spider-Man said and then, apparently remembering his manners, added: \u201cThanks for looking out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI would probably be a red-and-gold pancake if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like pancakes,\u201d the kid said randomly, and Tony loved him a tiny bit more right then.</p>\n<p>He turned to Steve. \u201cI need a minute with the kid. I\u2019ll see you at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve didn\u2019t even look surprised. He just gave another regal nod to the both of them, then turned away. Tony gazed after the man as he marched back to the roof door and let it fall shut behind him.</p>\n<p>He turned back to find that Spider-Man had moved away from him and had sat down at the edge of the building, facing the large mural painting, letting his legs dangle over the edge. Tony approached him, sitting down by his side.</p>\n<p>It stayed quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, if you <em>wanted </em>to know who I am, I think I would just tell you,\u201d Spider-Man then said.</p>\n<p>Tony floundered for a moment. The kid had never made an offer like that before. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been thinking about it. But you said you didn\u2019t want to know, so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glanced Spider-Man up and down. The skinny legs swaying back and forth, heels bouncing against the side of the building, the hands fumbling in his lap, the slouching posture that couldn\u2019t possibly be comfortable. He reminded himself once again that there was an actual teenager under there, who lived and breathed and had thoughts and probably worried about homework and girlfriends or boyfriends. Someone who could maybe use a mentor. \u201cGive me a few days to think about it, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe secret identity thing can be a bit of a drag, right?\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m wrapped up in one, too. Maybe more than one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man cocked his head. \u201cTell me more, Hannah Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t bore you with the details.\u201d Tony leaned back on his hands and glanced up at the colorful mural painting he knew so well. \u201cWhat is it about this painting you like so much?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man slowly rocked back and forth, as if he was debating whether he should answer the question. Finally, he lifted a hand and pointed. \u201cI can see my uncle. The smiling figure on the far right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony cocked his head and squinted. The main reason why he loved abstract art, was that everyone could see themselves reflected in it somehow. \u201cI see. You get along with him, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Spider-Man said, lifting his shoulders for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tony said, trying to keep his voice light, \u201cas someone who has no real family left to speak of: make sure he knows it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Spider-Man said again, his chest lifting and deflating with a deep sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want a copy or something?\u201d Tony suggested. \u201cBecause I was serious last time; I can get it done for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can,\u201d Spider-Man said in a rather matter-of-fact tone.</p>\n<p>The artist\u2019s name <em>Nescio </em>might seem mysterious to anyone who had ever tried to google the painting, but it wasn\u2019t a mystery to Tony. He had been into art from a young age, and had always favored colorful, abstract paintings. Having more money than he could possibly spend in a lifetime, meant that he could afford to have some of the worlds finest art hanging from his walls. It wasn\u2019t until about five, maybe six years ago that he started to show his <em>own </em>work to other people. Just Pepper first, and then, with some of her encouragement, to some friends who had an eye for art. One old colleague who worked in local government now, asked him if he would be interested in having one of his painting replicated in a mural they wanted to paint opposite the children\u2019s hospital of Queens.</p>\n<p>Tony had agreed, under the condition that he could sign it with a pseudonym. He didn\u2019t want to run the risk of art connoisseurs everywhere mocking him. At the same time, he had agreed out of some sense of self-importance. Having your painting up here for the world to see\u2026 well, it certainly stroked his ego. He hadn\u2019t fully realized until recently that his painting might actually <em>mean </em>something to other people. Something to cheer up the kids when they looked out the hospital windows.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t just tell Spider-Man about it. Maybe it was something to do with how Spider-Man insisted on hiding his name, address, face, the whole kit and caboodle. So Tony figured he was allowed <em>one </em>little secret of his own.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Nowadays, Tony\u2019s Saturdays were all exclusively reserved for one activity: hanging out in the back of the caf\u00e9 he owned and pestering Peter about his job, his grades and his girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t ever seem to mind, always humoring him with a gentle smile and patient responses. Tony couldn\u2019t fathom why. As far as he was concerned, his own behavior was entirely ridiculous from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Then again, he had nothing better to do, so what the hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about your paper on solar distillation?\u201d Peter asked, after he had finished giving Tony a satisfactory rundown of the essay he was writing.</p>\n<p>Tony gave a helpless shrug. \u201cDr. Benjamin is still acting like he\u2019s the damn Spider-Man of the science world, and he has no reason to. It\u2019s not as if we invented time travel. We\u2019re slightly altering the design of solar stills, that\u2019s all. What do you think I should do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust publish it without putting his name,\u201d Peter suggested. \u201cHe said he was okay with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I will. Thing is, the way he is avoiding me feels a little suspicious. Like he\u2019s waiting for me to publish it, so he can claim I plagiarized his work without his consent, and then sue me for a billion dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re too trusting, squirt,\u201d Tony informed him. \u201cNewsflash: People are evil.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really think that.\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t work so hard to save people all the time if you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me on a technicality,\u201d Tony admitted. \u201cWhat about you? The caf\u00e9 is running just fine, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThe regulars will keep coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026?\u201d Tony asked, because he sensed that there was one.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d Peter said. \u201cSome guy called Mr. Edward is the new owner, but no one has ever seen him. People just whisper about him, like he\u2019s the phantom of the opera. I don\u2019t know his deal. Laura\u2019s a really good cook and she\u2019s got amazing social skills and all. But she just wants to stuff people full of her homemade cakes; it\u2019s like her life\u2019s mission. She\u2019s not gonna be doing the PR for this place. Like, posting pictures on social media, or sending newsletters or organizing promotion contests. And I don\u2019t see anyone else doing it, either. Which is a problem, I think. These days, if you don\u2019t exist online, you might as well not exist at all. GoaTea is basically stuck in the stone age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Tony said, frowning thoughtfully. \u201cSo you need a Facebook page?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re better off using Instagram,\u201d Peter said. \u201cInstagram is visual. So is food. We need to upload loads of pictures of coffee and pie, the kind that make you drool all over your keyboard. Preferably with funny puns, like\u2026 \u2018It\u2019s Tea o\u2019clock!\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re </em>on Instagram, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Peter said, suddenly blushing heavily. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nose is growing, Pinocchio. What, your profile is a bunch of mushy pictures of you with your girlfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not on Instagram,\u201d Peter insisted.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t really matter, so Tony let it slide. \u201cWhat about the other one? Uhm \u2013 Twitter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeh,\u201d Peter said, making a wibbly-wobbly gesture with his hand.</p>\n<p>A shadow fell over their table. \u201cHey,\u201d the shadow said.</p>\n<p>Tony glanced up and sat back in his seat. \u201cMrs. Flanigan, always a pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennie looked back at him, a little blearily. She looked worse than last time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Peter chimed in.</p>\n<p>She shrugged, picking at a lose thread in her scarf. \u201cI\u2019m having one of those days, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter said gently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find a seat? I\u2019ll bring you a cup of tea and we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tea, then,\u201d Peter concluded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Tony suggested, pointing at the other side of the booth. \u201cI cold use your advice on a few things.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sat, her large coat puffing up around her. \u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d she said, dropping her voice to a conspirational whisper. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>actually </em>the head of some university.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. No kidding,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony should have known he wouldn\u2019t be able to come to the same caf\u00e9 every Saturday, moving around among the general public, without anything ever going wrong.</p>\n<p>And bad luck always comes in threes.</p>\n<p>Strike one was the rude man claiming to be a fan who spotted him when he passed their booth on his way to the toilet. He lingered near their booth, no matter how many hints Tony dropped that he didn\u2019t want to be crowded, and kept asking questions about chitauri aliens and wormholes. The type of questions that made Tony\u2019s anxiety spike even on a good day. The man didn\u2019t leave until Tony decided to screw professionalism and told him to \u201cjust get lost already\u201d.</p>\n<p>Strike two was the warning message Happy sent him ten minutes later, that some passerby had posted a picture of him in the caf\u00e9 on Instagram. Fucking Instagram. Tony\u2019s feeling of unease increased.</p>\n<p>Strike three was the stampede of photographers that invaded the caf\u00e9 less than five minutes later, as if summoned by the devil.</p>\n<p>Jennie responded to the invasion by promptly lowering herself to the floor and hiding under the table. Honestly, Tony wished he could do the same. But that wouldn\u2019t do much for his reputation that was already shoddy at best.</p>\n<p><em>Stay calm and address them politely, </em>Pepper always said. But as Tony pushed himself to his feet unsteadily, he was feeling that pressing weight on his chest and that numbness in his hands, which he recognized as the tell-tale signs of an all-consuming panic attack brewing in his mind like dark storm clouds.</p>\n<p>Cameras flashed and people shouted questions that may as well have been in Hebrew, and Tony could see even more photographers gathering near the door, cutting off his escape route.</p>\n<p>A firm, steady hand grabbed his arm. Peter. \u201cTony, run!\u201d he urged, and then he was pulling him along through the sea of paparazzi. It seemed like there were hundreds of them now, arms brushing against him, someone tried to trip him, Peter pushed back and snarled. They were in a small room with piles of dirty dishes. A narrow hallway past a kitchen. People were still following, and Tony could feel his heart skip into overdrive. His chest ached from it. It was the <em>only </em>thing he could still feel. That, and Peter\u2019s hand around his arm, leading him on and on.</p>\n<p>Peter pulled him outside into an alleyway littered with garbage bags. He slammed the door into the face of one of the photographers and took out his key, turning it in the lock. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, grabbing Tony\u2019s arm again. \u201cThey\u2019ll try to go around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony didn\u2019t ask where they could even go. He just needed to breathe right now. <em>Breathe</em>. There were street tiles and a rat scurrying away and more doors and stairs and a fire extinguisher against the wall and plush carpet. They were inside again, Tony realized.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s hand left his arm, which Tony took as a sign that the kid considered them to be in safe territory. Tony trusted him to be right, and let himself slide to the floor, his back pressed against the wall.</p>\n<p>He could tell by Peter\u2019s animated gestures that the kid was talking to him, but he didn\u2019t register any sound. Just blood rushing in his ears. His body was strung with tension, so much so that every single muscle was hurting.</p>\n<p>\n<em>My meds.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t get these attacks as often as he used to, but he had still badgered Dr. Cho until she had signed of on some killer sedatives that always worked like a charm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWater,\u201d he rasped. He didn\u2019t hear his own voice, but something must have come out, because Peter left and returned with a glass. Tony dug through his pocket to fid the pills and took two, just in case.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>A door slammed. Tony grumbled. He didn\u2019t want to get up yet. He didn\u2019t <em>have </em>to, did he? Did he have any meetings today? Today was\u2026 wedntuesday, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, damn, you woke him up!\u201d a voice said.</p>\n<p>He then heard a female voice. <em>Pepper</em>, he thought. He was supposed to tell her something, but what? He couldn\u2019t remember now. It had been something important. He opened his eyes and blinked a few times, but the world remained dark. Were those Pepper\u2019s footsteps, coming closer?</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you invite a drugged-up homeless guy into our home <em>again</em>?\u201d Pepper asked.</p>\n<p>Tony frowned at the strange question. But before he could formulate a reply, the other voice said, from somewhere to his left: \u201cNo, May. That\u2019s Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>His blanket was pulled down and everything wasn\u2019t dark anymore. The world was still blurry, though. \u201cOh, excuse me,\u201d Pepper said, her voice a drawl. \u201cDid you invite a drugged-up <em>Tony</em> <em>Stark</em> into our home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe took some prescription for his anxiety. He\u2019s just a little loopy. You gotta let him sleep it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper,\u201d Tony muttered, suddenly remembering what he was supposed to tell her. \u201cWe gotta, uhm, make social media accounts for the caf\u00e9. Because if you don\u2019t exist online you might as well not exist at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnore him,\u201d the voice said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine in an hour and then I\u2019ll feed him some dinner, maybe put him in front of the TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going on patrol this evening, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>A short silence fell. Somehow it felt tense.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, relax,\u201d Pepper then said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. He\u2019s clearly not going to remember any of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper,\u201d Tony insisted. \u201cWe need Instagram. It\u2019s the <em>future</em>. GoaTea is stuck in the stone age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another blurry blob of a person moved closer to him. Someone short and slender. Tony wrecked his brain trying to remember who it was. Did Pepper hire a new assistant? \u201cIt\u2019s not <em>your </em>caf\u00e9, Tony,\u201d the voice said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about any of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice was kind and soothing, but Tony still frowned, because something was not right, there. \u201cWhat do you mean? You took care of it, right? Uhm \u2013 when you sent that letter to Human Resources?\u201d</p>\n<p>He heard a sigh. \u201cGo back to sleep, Tony,\u201d the voice murmured, and a hand patted his blanket.</p>\n<p>Tony did.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony emerged from the pleasant haze of his sedatives to find himself in a small, somewhat chaotic apartment. He was lying on a couch, covered with a blanket and surrounded by tiny pillows that almost exactly did <em>not </em>match.</p>\n<p>May Parker was sitting at the dining room table, peeling a potato. Peter was nowhere in sight, but Tony became aware of the sound of a shower running somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha\u2019time izzit?\u201d he croaked.</p>\n<p>She glanced at him. Her whole composure was casual, as if Peter bringing random people back to the apartment to crash on the couch was a common occurrence around here. \u201cA little past six. Want to join us for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sat up, roughly rubbing his face for a few seconds. He could still feel the tightness in his neck and shoulders, and the buzz of anxiety in the back of his head. But he had made it out without punching any journalists in the face.</p>\n<p>Realizing May had asked him a question, he looked back at her. \u201cSure. If it\u2019s no trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>She merely nodded, before pointing at the phone on the table in front of her. \u201cYour phone went off a few times. Someone named Happy. But we didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know I\u2019m not dead,\u201d Tony mumbled. He pushed himself to his feet and made his way to the table on wobbly legs, before sagging down in a chair with a deep sigh.</p>\n<p>May studied him across her pile of potatoes. \u201cI know it\u2019s the American way to try and fix everything with pills. But honestly, sometimes those things do more harm than good. You\u2019d do a lot better with some breathing exercises.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Cho had suggested the same thing. Tony hadn\u2019t exactly thanked her for the advice. He just wanted the drugs. But he couldn\u2019t let himself be as rude to May Parker as he had been to Dr. Cho, that day. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed.</p>\n<p>Anxious to get off the subject, he picked up his phone. He winced at the nine missed calls from Happy. None from Pepper, though. That meant the situation was salvageable. He dialed Happy\u2019s number.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst head of security ever,\u201d Tony accused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t <em>secure </em>you if you insist on gallivanting around Queens on your own every Saturday!\u201d Happy argued. \u201cAnd I <em>did </em>warn you someone had clocked you on Instagram. Where the hell are you? The news says you were kidnapped by a teenager who has connections to some drug lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprisingly accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does <em>that</em> mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll be home later this evening, okay? The drug lord was kind enough to invite me to dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Happy didn\u2019t even balk at that. \u201cDo you want me to release a statement to the press?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell them the next time they gang up on me, <em>someone</em>\u2018s gonna die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll run that by Erin, first,\u201d Happy muttered.</p>\n<p>Peter emerged from the bathroom ten minutes later, toweling off his wet hair. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, grinning brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re awake. How are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA bit like I was trampled by a herd of cows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe <em>were </em>almost trampled,\u201d Peter agreed. He hung the towel over the back of his chair before sitting down in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you contact your boss about this whole shitstorm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Laura was cool about it. Said it\u2019s probably good publicity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Jennie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter seemed to appreciate that question a lot. \u201cA little shaken, but fine. She can stand her ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>Better than Tony, clearly. He tried not to feel too bad about that. <em>You\u2019re allowed to not be okay, sometimes, </em>Pepper always said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo double shift today?\u201d He asked May.</p>\n<p>She straightened her back and her eyes brightened. \u201cI\u2019m taking a break for those for a bit. Peter got a full scholarship from a foundation we had never even heard of. Paid by some lady we don\u2019t know at all. For whatever university he decides to go to!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ducked his head, looking quietly pleased.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Tony said, his eyes drifting to Peter. \u201cWhat do you want to study?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChemical engineering. MIT, I hope.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony approved.</p>\n<p>They had chicken with mashed potatoes, and for dessert May fed him something that people in the middle ages probably used to fortify their castle walls, but that she claimed to be \u2018walnut date loaf\u2019.</p>\n<p>Peter ate the whole thing and told May it was delicious, so Tony did the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you won\u2019t be coming to the caf\u00e9 for a bit?\u201d Peter asked. He looked disappointed at the prospect, which warmed Tony\u2019s hart.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably unwise,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut maybe you want to come to the tower sometime? I can give you a tour of the workshop, or Dr. Banner\u2019s lab. He studied chemical engineering, too. He studied everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s mouth dropped open, his eyes widened comically and his ears turned red again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how his face looks when he is excited,\u201d May assured Tony, and Tony laughed.</p>\n<p>He helped May do the dishes after dinner and, after studying the dark street for a while from behind the curtain to make sure he would make it to his car without getting accosted by anymore paparazzi, he finally said his goodbyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll set a date soon, kid,\u201d he told Peter, who fervently nodded in response. \u201cAnd thanks for the walnut date loaf, May. It was\u2026 yeah, bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part I: Three confessions </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>People often assumed that Tony had to be a prime example of unbearable hubris and narcissism, constantly surrounded by people who told him how great he was. How people could possibly draw that conclusion was beyond him. He was married to Pepper and rooming with the Avengers. Caustic comments abound. And even most of his staff was insubordinate, even on a good day. Pepper hired only people who were the very best in their field, meaning every single one of them could find another, possibly even a better job at the snap of their fingers. Tony Stark generally needed them more than they needed Tony Stark.</p>\n<p>Exhibit A: Dr. Cho, whose stern and unimpressed face was currently filling one of the screens in Tony\u2019s workshop as he brabbled through an explanation on how he might do better with some breathing exercises, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean,\u201d Dr. Cho said with wonderful restraint, \u201cthe kind of breathing exercises I suggested to you over a year ago? When your response was: \u2018go stick your head up a dead cow\u2019s ass and just give me the meds\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>All right, so maybe Tony <em>could </em>be a little unbearable at times. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always liked you, Helen,\u201d he started.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass a few leaflets on to you,\u201d she cut in, her voice perfunctory. \u201cI suggest you get in touch with a therapist to make full use of them. I\u2019m not an expert on PTSD.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony resisted the urge to tell her to stick her head somewhere, and nodded politely.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, he was frowning down at a leaflet that gave step-by-step instructions on breathing through an anxiety attack.</p>\n<p>Fittingly, Clint Barton chose that moment to stroll into his workshop, his bow in one hand, his phone in the other. \u201cStark. I got something important to show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me it is not an Instagram post.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is definitely not an Instagram post.\u201d</p>\n<p>It <em>was </em>an Instagram post.</p>\n<p>Well, this one was kind of funny, Tony would admit that. And it wasn\u2019t even terribly insulting.</p>\n<p>The comic had only two panels, which was also new. Apparently, NightMonkey was moving into a new style period like Picasso going from blue to rose. Or maybe something less pretentious.</p>\n<p>The left panel showed an infuriated Tony Stark holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a muffin in the other, surrounded by paparazzi all shouting inane questions. The right panel showed an utterly relaxed Tony Stark surrounded by \u2018mamarazzi\u2019; a group of plump women all strangely reminiscent of GoaTea\u2019s new chef, Laura. They were feeding cartoon Tony Stark cookies, patting his head and making cooing noises.</p>\n<p>\u201cMildly amusing,\u201d he concurred.</p>\n<p>\u201cMeh,\u201d Clint said. He turned the screen of his phone back to himself and glanced down at the comic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you look like an idiot, so I\u2019ll have to mark it down for that. But I\u2019ll repost it anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI notice you haven\u2019t made a single joke or scathing remark about my full-blown meltdown at GoaTea last weekend,\u201d Tony said. It was telling. For Clint of all people to consider something off limits to joke about, he had to be genuinely concerned about Tony\u2019s mental sanity.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is me joking about it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clint said, waving his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not you making a joke. That\u2019s you clicking a single button on Instagram. Ten points for laziness, zero points for style.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I <em>made </em>this comic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you didn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint gave a challenging smirk. \u201cDid <em>too</em>. You don\u2019t know who owns that account. I suppose there\u2019s no better time to reveal; it was me all along. All part of a long, elaborate prank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know FRIDAY can trace the actual IP address for that account in about three seconds, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo trace it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what? Just to see the name of some random American on my screen? I literally could not care less.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint put his phone away. \u201cYou care. Whether you admit it or not, I got into your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony made a show of sagging down in his chair with a disinterested face. \u201cAnything else? Because I got a teenager coming over to visit any second now, and I don\u2019t want his first experience in my workshop to be ruined by your presence, no offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOffense taken,\u201d Clint said. \u201cI\u2019m great with teenagers. And speaking of segues, I tried to shoot a teenager through the head this morning but the release of my bow didn\u2019t trigger properly. So if you could have a look.\u201d He held the bow out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI feel like I should ask more about the teenager, first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNatasha and I were training. She set it up. It wasn\u2019t actually a teenager, just a smaller-sized dummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Across the room, Dum-E fired to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony yelled, raising a hand to halt Dum-E\u2019s movements. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t talking to you. Keep your extinguisher in your pants, don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dum-E whirred in disappointment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d Tony told Clint, taking the bow. \u201cNow, beat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint did, but not before tapping <em>repost </em>on his screen with exaggerated motions and a superior sort of smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might just rework this bow so it fires backwards next time!\u201d Tony called after him.</p>\n<p>As <em>if </em>Clint would set up an Instagram account like that. Well, it would be just like him, actually. But that man didn\u2019t have an artistic bone in his body; he certainly wouldn\u2019t waste his time on drawing comics. Tony sighed and focused his attention on the bow in his hands. Because Clint didn\u2019t get into his head. He didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He just <em>didn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>Damn it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY find the IP address behind that Instagram account.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease stand by. Analyzing account. IP address found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s behind it?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time in her existence, FRIDAY didn\u2019t grant him with an immediate response.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say,\u201d FRIDAY then said, and Tony almost tumbled out of his chair because his A.I. had <em>never before </em>made a comment like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, before I could barely be bothered, but <em>now </em>you bet your artificial ass I want to know! What has you so secretive? Is it <em>actually </em>Clint?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of telling him, FRIDAY simply showed her findings on the screen in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh</em>,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>The elevator doors slid open.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! A bit late. Sorry,\u201d Peter said, his face flustered as always. \u201cMy sweater got caught in the sliding door. They always say on the subway \u2018stand clear of the closing doors\u2019, and I\u2019ve ignored it, and now the doors strike back.\u201d He had taken off his sweater and balled it up, clenching it to his chest. He shuffled forward, glanced at the screen on the wall and evidently saw his own name there, because he smiled and asked: \u201cwere you googling me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony turned in his chair and stared up at him. \u201cDo you like orange juice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowned, puzzled for a moment. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gave a nod and turned to move to the fridge in the corner of his workshop. The kid shuffled after him. Tony laid Clint\u2019s bow on his workbench and turned on his soldering iron. He opened the fridge and reached inside for the orange juice, then turned and casually revealed: \u201cI know all about your secret identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>A beat of silence. \u201cUm,\u201d Peter said, bunching his sweater in his hands. \u201cWhich\u2026 which one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Which one?</em>\u201d Tony echoed, dropping the bottle of orange juice to the table. \u201cWhich one? Who are you, Banksy? Does he do Instagram on the weekends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter had the gall to smile. Tony had seen everything and anything make this kid nervous, but <em>now </em>he smiled, all dimples and twinkly eyes. \u201cOh, that. Took you long enough to find out. Did you hack Instagram?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY took care of it in two seconds flat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d Peter asked with a look of wide-eyed innocence, though it was still plain and clear he was making an effort not to giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes Barton know it\u2019s you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head. \u201cHim reposting the comics was a complete coincidence. Case in point; he first reposted my comic before you and I had even met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not mad. Because I see ample opportunity to use this against him somehow.\u201d Tony slid a glass of orange juice across the table.</p>\n<p>Peter sat down on the edge of the chair, still fiddling with his sweater. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to make Hawkeye my enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cI met him in the elevator, and the first thing he said to me was that he shot someone just my size through the head this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut making <em>me </em>your enemy is not an issue?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Peter said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a big softie.\u201d He took a few sips of his orange juice, and as he did, his expression slowly shifted into something Tony couldn\u2019t really put his finger on. He was about to ask what was on the kid\u2019s mind, when Peter spoke first: \u201cYou know what you should do? You should get FRIDAY to find the IP address for that Dr. Benjamin, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy who commented on my research? I\u2019d sort of given up on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFind him,\u201d Peter suggested.</p>\n<p>Tony stared at him, a horrible suspicion brewing in the back of his mind. \u201cFRIDAY?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cProcessing \u2026 Stand by \u2026 IP Address found \u2026. - Are you sure you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the findings were presented on the screen, and then Tony\u2019s worldview <em>really </em>tilted on its axis. He cocked his head. Rubbed his eyes. Closed them and took a steadying breath before looking again, but it was still the same name being displayed on his screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d he asked, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t because FRIDAY never lied. \u201cDid Barton put you up to this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal, when you really think about it,\u201d Peter said. He was still fiddling with his sweater. He looked nervous, but more like he was concerned for Tony\u2019s mental health than like he was worried about getting in trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony said, his mind slowly falling apart into shellshocked shards. \u201cYour generation obviously has a very different definition of \u2018a big deal\u2019 than mine. This coming from someone who once flew a nuke through a wormhole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was nervous,\u201d Peter explained. \u201cI had been following your research for a while, and I was going to email you about that solar distillation. Then you turned up at my caf\u00e9 that day, and suddenly it seemed weird to email you under my own name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shook his head. Dazed. Astonished. \u201cLook \u2013 no offense, but I\u2019m still not convinced this isn\u2019t some prank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to talk you through my notes on solar distillation? My main point was, if you can harness the heat loss and use it for <em>further </em>distillation, there is less thermal loss and the overall efficiency is higher. I suggested using a cylindrical tube collector, because sun rays hit it at a different angle than if you used a flat tube collector, which means heat loss is reduced.\u201d Peter started counting on his fingers. \u201cThe tube collector has an absorbing tube, and evaporating tube, an outer glass tube-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, squirt, I don\u2019t need to hear all the reruns from <em>Bill Nye, the science guy</em>. I believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snapped his mouth shut and lowered his hand. Then, he smiled a little and went back to sipping his orange juice while Tony stared at him and tried to make sense of what his life had become. \u201cKid, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s PhD level science.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did most of the work,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI just had a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour good idea is going to save companies thousands of dollars. How did we never-\u2026 You do-\u2026 You do realize you\u2019re a genius, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, don\u2019t get freaking modest on me right now. Please just tell me, you <em>do </em>know you\u2019re a genius, right? Don\u2019t let this be one of those <em>Rain Man </em>scenarios where your talents have gone unnoticed by everyone and now I have to be the one to step up and fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a straight-A student,\u201d Peter said with a faint smile. \u201cAnd I already got a scholarship. From some lady I had never even heard of. I think we\u2019re good. I didn\u2019t keep it a secret to mess with you or anything. I was awkward about bringing it up, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony realized now that he <em>did </em>know, because he had been doing more or less exactly the same thing. He cleared his throat and rubbed his sleeve at a coffee stain on the table. \u201cI suppose I should\u2026\u201d he started, but then stopped again. He felt like he was about to enter a minefield where any wrong move could have very, very nasty consequences.</p>\n<p>But this was his window to come clean, and if he didn\u2019t now \u2013 after everything Peter had just told him \u2013 he felt like Peter might hold it against him later.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he started again, before taking another pause to think. Finally, he settled on: \u201cYou know how I\u2019m used to solving every problem by throwing money at it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>don\u2019t</em> know,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut I\u2019m curious where this is going, so let\u2019s say I do know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bought the caf\u00e9 where you work, using a fake name, and renamed it GoaTea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stared at him, his facial expression not changing even a little bit. He just blinked a few times. \u201cYou bought the caf\u00e9? Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTax benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Tony</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>O-kay\u2026 </em>Well, I didn\u2019t like how that boss-guy was treating you, and then you said you didn\u2019t want to quit, so I did the next best thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next best thing,\u201d Peter echoed weakly. \u201cThe next-\u2026 When someone tells you you can\u2019t have a dog, do you do the next best thing and buy up a whole zoo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re talking to a guy who once bought a live reindeer for Christmas to brighten up the living room. Actually, it was a donkey, but that part was my mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201c Peter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was also the one who set up that college fund for you,\u201d Tony said, because he felt if he just added that on real quick, it would feel more like an addendum on his first secret rather than a whole separate secret.</p>\n<p>Peter still blanched. \u201cThey told me that was some lady who-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cMaria Howard,\u201d Tony nodded. \u201cSo we both have some pseudonyms flying around. Call it even?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not the same, though,\u201d Peter said, his voice now shaky. \u201cThe Instagram and the solar distillation; I did all that stuff because I thought it was fun to do. But you actually\u2026 Why would you do all that for me when I didn\u2019t ever do anything for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal \u2013 I\u2019ve done this for lots of kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Peter seemed to relax marginally. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I made that up. Sorry. I just don\u2019t want you to freak out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFreak out?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was pitched even higher than usual. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m not freaking out. It\u2019s totally normal to have a billionaire spend thousands of dollars on you. Totally normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re freaking out,\u201d Tony established. \u201cCan I give you a hug?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter readily said, standing.</p>\n<p>It was a clumsy hug, with Peter\u2019s nose pressing into Tony\u2019s shoulder and his balled up sweater getting squished between them. \u201cI just\u2026 Thank you,\u201d came Peter\u2019s muffled voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the whole reason my aunt doesn\u2019t have to work double shifts anymore!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Tony said, stepping back. \u201cMore time to watch classic movies with her favorite nephew. Now that I know you were the one who send me notes on solar distillation, I am three times more sure that you deserve a scholarship more than anyone. And this is good. All the secrets out of the way. You know who I am. I know who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blew out a breath, and slumped back into the chair. \u201cThere\u2019s something else I suppose I should tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony braced himself. \u201cLay it on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Peter paused for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>actually </em>like orange juice that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWell, after everything else, that\u2019s certainly something I can handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Peter said, \u201cdo you remember that time Spider-Man got shot in the shoulder after saving your ass, and then he told you his aunt was a nurse and she would take care of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? I mean - - wait. I mean - - <em>WHAT?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter thoughtlessly twirled a strand of hair around his finger. \u201cI was so worried when May said she met you at the hospital a few days later. I thought you would figure it all out. I mean \u2013 you must have thought it was strange that the aunt I live with is <em>also </em>a nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said. \u201c<em>Nope</em>. Time out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter dug into a pocket and took out the watch Tony had given Spider-Man a few weeks ago. He gently placed it on the table. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to know who I am. But you get to a point where it\u2019s weird to keep it a secret because you already <em>did </em>know who I am. You just didn\u2019t know that you know.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it, now,\u201d Tony said in a level voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Tony said, \u201cI\u2019m just freaking out a little bit. This is too much. I gotta lie down or something. I need \u2013 I need my breathing exercises. Grab that leaflet over there on my desk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe blue and green one \u2013 hurry up!\u201d</p>\n<p>As Tony lay flat on his back, Peter hurried away and came back with the leaflet, already reciting: \u201cThis breathing technique for stress, anxiety and panic takes only a few minutes and can be done anywhere. You will get the most benefit if you do them regularly, as a part of your daily \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cForget that part, just get to the breathing!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sat cross-legged next to Tony on the floor. \u201cBreathe in through your nose to a count of five.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony did.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow hold your breath for ten seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony puffed out. \u201cWhat am I, a blue whale?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLess talking, more breathing! Start from the top. In through the nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony let Peter talk him through two cycles of breathing in and out before giving up again. \u201cBut kid,\u201d he said, desperate to make Peter see reason. \u201cYou can\u2019t be all three those people. You just can\u2019t. This is impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeirder things have happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but only about six, in the history of the entire universe.\u201d He looked up at Peter. He looked again. And again. \u201cYou\u2019re Spider-Man. You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re Spider-Man. I mean, when you <em>know </em>it\u2026. It\u2019s like staring at a drawing of a duck for years and then finding out there\u2019s also a rabbit in there. I suppose I <em>should </em>have realized the thing about your aunt. Not to mention your uncle, whom you saw in my painting\u2026 though you didn\u2019t say then that he\u2019d passed away. Hah! The painting that I made! There, that\u2019s another secret from me. Not that it matters because you\u2019re <em>Spider-Man</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you jabbering about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe mural painting you love so much? I made it. Just didn\u2019t want to sign my own name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s mouth dropped open, the leaflet fluttered to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re Nescio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t gape at me! You got no right after that bombshell you dropped on me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell <em>me</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think I was a creepy stalker!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want <em>you </em>to think I was a creepy stalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2026 oh my god, <em>you </em>really painted it? That\u2019s \u2026 insane. Insane. Hang on. Are <em>you </em>Banksy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re freaking <em>Spider-Man</em>. Don\u2019t talk to <em>me </em>about what\u2019s insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>And they kept talking, not so much with each other but <em>at </em>each other until they were both out of breath and just staring each other in the face with tentative smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe make a fine pair, huh?\u201d Tony said. He slowly sat up and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cDamn. I should have listened to Pepper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, what did she say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t listening. Your aunt knows about this, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Good. If she knows, then I am one hundred percent in the clear. I\u2019m still going to lecture you, though. Get ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Peter said, \u201cwould this be a good moment to ask if your workshop is <em>supposed</em> to be on fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony spun his head around, then swore and jumped to his feet. \u201cDamnit, Dum-E!\u201d he yelled as he rushed to turn off the soldering iron. \u201cThe <em>one </em>time there\u2019s <em>actually </em>a fire!\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Clint returned to the workshop a few hours later.</p>\n<p>Peter hadn\u2019t heard him come in; the guy was just suddenly standing between two rows of shelves like he was the grim reaper. When Peter jumped and dropped a heavy wrench to the floor, Clint grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cClint,\u201d Tony said without looking up from his work. \u201cDo I need to put a tiny bell on you, like my mother used to do with the cat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever gets your motor running, boo-boo,\u201d Clint said, sauntering closer to the table where Tony was avidly sketching.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you finish my bow, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPriorities. We\u2019re making a Spider-Man suit, instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glanced at Peter. \u201cThis kid is officially my minion, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said, offering a tentative smile. \u201cMr. Stark is my Gru.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThe hell does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou started it with the \u2018minion\u2019 thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinion is a <em>word</em>, kid. Dictionary-approved and all. I don\u2019t know what millennial thing you are referencing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you a picture later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you come from, again?\u201d Clint asked Peter. His gaze was less hostile and more curious now than it had been in the elevator that morning. \u201cA nephew of Pepper\u2019s, or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter said, glancing over to Tony for help. He didn\u2019t mind telling the other Avengers the true story at this point, but he didn\u2019t know if Tony was ready to go over the whole thing again, after the reveal this morning had almost sent him into a panic attack.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a new intern,\u201d Tony said, waving a hand. \u201cLook, Barton, we\u2019ll get to your precious bow eventually, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint approached the workbench where Tony had left his bow and frowned down at it. \u201cIt looks\u2026 scorched. Did you set my bow on fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to look like that,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019ll finish it later. Is that really such a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Clint said. \u201cYou\u2019re putting a serious dent in my plans to go sit in a tree and shoot pigeons all afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShoot pigeons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re assholes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need a proper hobby,\u201d Tony told him. \u201cLearn to crochet or something. Now, scram. The more you distract us, the longer it will take for me to actually get around to fixing your damn bow.\u201d</p>\n<p>That finally convinced Clint to leave them alone. He gave Peter a final, searching glance, then retreated back to the elevator, muttering about pigeons under his breath. The doors slid shut and peace was restored.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can tell them,\u201d Peter said. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gave a nod. \u201cI will. Just\u2026 gotta let it sink in, first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what does it mean that I\u2019m your \u2018minion\u2019?\u201d Peter asked, because all this tinkering around with a new suit was nice and all, but he also needed to know where exactly they stood.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means I got your back.\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean like a side-kick? Or like a mentor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou\u2019re a kid genius and a super-hero. On paper, I\u2019m the perfect mentor. But in reality \u2026 I don\u2019t know if you need a mentor perse, with that brain of yours. What advice could I possibly give you? Maybe the sidekick-role is a better fit, if you\u2019re giving me a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wasn't sure why Tony's choice felt somehow disappointing. \u201cBut you could tell me stuff like\u2026 \u2018stop worrying about your grades and spend more time doing the things you love!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019d be all like: \u2018But Mr. Stark if I don\u2019t get good grades I won\u2019t graduate college and I\u2019ll never get a job and I\u2019d end up living on the streets and dying behind a dumpster!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAnd then what would I say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled. \u201cYou figure the next one out yourself. You already ask about my school and my love life all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think that\u2019s\u2026 annoying as hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I like it,\u201d Peter confessed. May was always involved in his schoolwork, but at the same time, often didn\u2019t really understand his work. He couldn\u2019t bounce ideas off of her like he could Tony. And May was supportive of his relationship but\u2026 sometimes you just needed advice from another man. Not a sidekick. A mentor.</p>\n<p>It was as if Tony could fill in some of the gaps.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The gaps Ben left behind?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Damn, what was he getting himself into.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part II: Three weeks later</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter first used his panic button a little past midnight on a dark, stormy Friday evening, as gusts of wind slammed waves of thick droplets against the windows of Avengers Tower.</p>\n<p>Steve was already up and out the door before Tony fully realized where that sudden, annoying beep was coming from.</p>\n<p>He still reached Peter before Steve did. There was no wormhole, no steadily growing puddle of blood, not even some sort of child-eating monster dressed like a clown. Only a nervous Spider-Man in a back alley, who started brabbling as soon as Tony landed next to him and stepped out of the suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry \u2013 no emergency \u2013 ohmygosh I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony frowned and lifted a hand to shield his eyes from the sharp raindrops whipping down. \u201cDid you press it by accident?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nervously hopped from one leg to the other, as if he had a sudden urge to pee. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t. I just\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I was so focussed on working through this freaking storm and my web fluid ran out and I got disoriented with all the rain and I followed this bicycle thief and lost track of where I even am and when I finally got back my backpack was gone with my clothes and my phone and my wallet and my keys and my aunt is working a night shift so I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how I was supposed to even get home and I\u2019ve been walking for an hour thinking of what to do and I couldn\u2019t work it out and I did try to-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou got some good lung capacity there, but take a breath before you pass out. FRIDAY, tell Rogers it\u2019s not an emergency and not to worry his pretty little ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peter repeated, miserably. \u201cThat was really lame. I\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I called you. I didn\u2019t even think and then when I realized how stupid it was, there was no cancel-button. I know that button is supposed to be for, like, when dragons attack and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would definitely be an excellent reason. I\u2019ve fought dragons a few times, myself. I could give you some pointers.\u201d</p>\n<p>The attempt at humor fell flat, judging by Peter\u2019s slumping shoulders. Tony figured he should try again once the kid was dry and warm. \u201cCan we get a spare key anywhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>The stream of babbling instantly started up again. \u201cMy aunt May, of course. But I can\u2019t go into the hospital like <em>this</em>. Maybe you could go, but if she\u2019s in surgery you\u2019ll have to wait a long time and I don\u2019t want to make you wait a long time. Or maybe you could lend me some clothes or something and I\u2019ll go in myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sighed. This was beginning to sound far too complicated for a late Friday evening. \u201cHow do you feel about crashing at the tower for the night? Yeah, that\u2019s probably for the best. I\u2019ll send your aunt a message.\u201d He lifted a hand to knock against the breastplate of his Iron-Man suit. \u201cHey FRIDAY, is Steve still on his way or did he turn back? Because we could use a ride. The alternative is I carry Spidey bridal style, and that will just be embarrassing for the both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is five minutes away,\u201d FIRDAY informed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy. Give Pepper a heads-up, please. And this suit is gonna have to find its own way home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediately, the faceplate closed, the repulsors fired up and the suit lifted up into the stormy skies.</p>\n<p>Tony ran a hand through his wet hair, and slowly started pacing, making a mental list of teenage requirements. Pizza was probably a big one. He glanced back at Peter, and noticed that the kid was standing awfully still. Tony realised he hadn\u2019t even verified if the kid <em>wanted </em>to stay at the Tower for the night. \u201cYou all set to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, you can\u2019t see my face right now,\u201d Peter said, \u201cbut rest assured that I\u2019m looking shocked and a little bit <em>absolutely freaking</em> flustered. You \u2013 you really think I can stay at the tower? Like \u2026 pajama party with the Hulk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. We have about twenty guest bedrooms for you to choose from. And one couch. Huh,\u201d Tony stopped pacing for a moment and frowned thoughtfully. \u201cWe should get more couches.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve parked at the end of the alley a few minutes later. \u201cLate patrol,\u201d he remarked when Peter and Tony crawled into the back.</p>\n<p>Peter pulled his mask off and leaned his head back, his expression disgruntled. \u201cI was planning to be home \u2013 like \u2013 two hours ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRan into some trouble, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHad his stuff stolen,\u201d Tony said, when it seemed Peter wasn\u2019t going to be forthcoming with an answer.</p>\n<p>Steve merely hummed and grabbed something from the passenger seat. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, throwing a\u00a0 sweater into the back seat.</p>\n<p>Tony wanted to point out that Peter\u2019s suit was as flawless as every single one of his designs <em>thankyouverymuch </em>and that Peter was perfectly warm and dry in there. Peter, of course, was too nice to bring that up, and obediently pulled the sweater over his head. He harshly tugged at the sleeves until his hands peeked out through the ends. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have pressed that button. It\u2019s stupid, I feel so embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKid,\u201d Tony said, pushing against Peter\u2019s shoulder until he could make eye contact \u201cthere is <em>never </em>not a good reason to call us, okay? If you feel like you need help, don\u2019t ever hesitate. I\u2019m being dead serious right now.\u201d His gaze on Peter didn\u2019t waver until the kid gave a reluctant nod. He then added: \u201cThough I could try to work out a system where you can differentiate between a life-or-death situation and a less urgent emergency. Maybe I\u2019ll simply put a whole separate A.I. in your suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter merely hummed, leaning his head against the window. He still looked really down. Tony was just happy to have the kid around again. Things had been quiet, the last few weeks. Tony wanted to steer clear of GoaTea for a little while, but when he had invited Peter over the tower last weekend, Peter had declined with what felt a bit like a lame excuse.</p>\n<p>But maybe Tony was just imagining things. \u201cDid you finish you homework at least?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t. Someone put superglue all over my books at school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI burnt it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glanced him up and down. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a pretty rough day, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought going patrolling would take my mind off it\u2026 Turns out that just when you think life can\u2019t get shittier, it goes ahead and proves you wrong.\u201d He gave Tony a glance. \u201cDid you <em>really </em>fight dragons once?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Tony said. He held his hands a few feet apart. \u201cVicious little creatures. This big.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Peter said. \u201cSo they weren\u2019t <em>really </em>dragons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they breathe fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSo they were basically lizards,\u201d Peter said. \u201cThat\u2019s your story: you were once attacked by a bunch of lizards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve chuckled.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter carefully descended the steps towards the Tower\u2019s living area, where he knew he\u2019d find the large, open kitchen.</p>\n<p>His lousy, <em>lousy</em> day yesterday had had a surprisingly satisfying ending. Shortly after pressing his panic button he had, ironically, panicked. It seemed that there were about a hundred options more viable than calling in the Avengers over a stolen backpack.</p>\n<p>But Tony had reacted in typical Tony fashion. Like the dumbest thing Peter had ever done was no big deal at all. It was funny. Tony always gave out a vibe like he was supposed to be a bigger asshole or something. But he <em>wasn\u2019t</em>. He might just be one of the kindest people Peter had ever met. Peter had been a little apprehensive these last few weeks, about whether this whole mentor-thing had been a terrible idea. But talking to Tony again last night\u2026 he realized he\u2019d missed the man\u2019s gentle cynicism and easy-going stubbornness.</p>\n<p>He was still wearing the sweater Steve had lend him last night, and he had pulled the drawstrings of his borrowed sweatpants tightly around his waste to keep them from slipping down. He shuffled forward carefully, focussing on where he stepped so he didn\u2019t trip over his own pant legs, all the while mumbling \u201cboy oh boy-ee-boy\u201d under his breath.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t look up until he had reached the kitchen island. So it was only then that he spotted Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff, both sitting at the other end of it, wearing equally amused expressions. He immediately realized he had blown his chance at an awesome, cool and collected first impression. \u201cHey,\u201d he blurted out, wondering why the universe kept spitting out the most embarrassing scenarios for him. What had he ever done to the universe?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who made the Instagram comics, right?\u201d Clint questioned in lieu of greeting back.</p>\n<p>Natasha slowly stirred her cup of tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Peter said, gingerly climbing onto one of the high chairs. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man, schmider-schman,\u201d Clint said. \u201cTell me about NightMonkey. What\u2019s he gonna draw next?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chewed his lip as he thought. \u201cI\u2019ve recently been informed that Tony Stark was once attacked by a bunch of lizards. I think I\u2019ll start there and see where we end up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI approve,\u201d Clint said.</p>\n<p>Natasha spoke up. \u201cSo we\u2019re supposed to believe that you are Spider-Man <em>and </em>you\u2019re the person who was cyberbullying him <em>and </em>you\u2019re an employee at the caf\u00e9 where he hid from the papzz?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a few things more. That\u2019s how we met, I don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d Peter said with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still somewhat convinced Tony just found you in his Happy Meal one day,\u201d Natasha said.</p>\n<p>Rude.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, come on. Feed him, Clint,\u201d Natasha told Clint.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? Why don\u2019t <em>you </em>do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy?\u201d she asked, before gently blowing on her tea.</p>\n<p>Clint clearly decided to choose his battles, and turned back to Peter. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever is easiest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly high maintenance, are you? Welp, he isn\u2019t Tony Stark\u2019s secret illegitimate son, then, we can establish that much,\u201d Clint poked Natasha in the side before sliding off his chair to open a kitchen cabinet. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna go home dressed like <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy aunt is picking me up. She\u2019s bringing clothes. And I need a new phone, and I need to apply for a new ID and <em>oh god </em>we probably have to change all the locks. May is going to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d a voice said. \u201cIt would take far too much time to train a new nephew to make good pasta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too, May,\u201d Peter said, turning to face his aunt. She was standing near one of the doorways next to Tony, who evidently let her into the building. May was holding a plastic bag, Tony a paper one.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have a fun sleep-over, honey?\u201d she asked, clearly not the least bit aware that she was supposed to make Peter look cool in front of the Avengers <em>damnit!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a sleep-over,\u201d he complained. \u201cIt was a\u2026 a business meeting. At night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d she replied without batting an eyelid. She patted the plastic bag. \u201cI brought you some clothes, unless you want to drive back home in your business attire?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glanced down at the oversized pajamas.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd speaking of outfits: Your suit,\u201d Tony said, lifting the paper bag. \u201cI put an A.I. in it, so it\u2019ll be easier for you to contact us in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wow, that was quick. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s not trivialize my achievements, I spent all night on it. Couldn\u2019t help but notice that you unlocked several web-shooter combinations that I specifically set to \u2018advanced level only\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a friend to hack it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony gave him a hard stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m advanced!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s stare remained unwavering.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not gonna work on me,\u201d Peter informed him, crossing his arms across his chest as his pajama sleeves flopped around. \u201cI grew up with <em>her</em>. I became immune to death glares at age eleven. The whole point of the suit was that I\u2019d be safer, right? So let me use it to its full potential. Otherwise, you might find me dead in an alleyway one day and you\u2019ll have to give my eulogy and be all like \u2018if only he had had his taser-web, he\u2019d still be alive today\u2019. You don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do hate giving speeches,\u201d Tony admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly the point I was trying to make, but we ended up where we needed to be, I guess,\u201d Peter said. As far as he was concerned, that had been a pretty good little speech. He almost figured that maybe he could get his fellow Avengers to look at him with awe and respect after all.</p>\n<p>Until he slipped off the chair to grabs his clothes from his aunt, tripped over his pant leg and promptly face planted on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Part III: Three musketeers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter had expected things to get easier after the panic button-incident. After he had been reminded how awesome it was to be at the tower, how much fun it was to have back-and-forths with Tony.</p>\n<p>But things didn\u2019t get easier.</p>\n<p>Tony sent him a message the following Saturday, once again inviting him to the tower. Something about working on developments in the forensic field with Dr. Banner and <em>holy shit</em> that sounded awesome. Peter read the message about fifty times over the course of the day, but it was as if an invisible force stopped him from responding.</p>\n<p>On Sunday came blessed relief in the form of MJ.</p>\n<p><em>Hey Peter, </em>she texted him, <em>Ned and I are at GoaTea. Wanna come hang out?</em></p>\n<p>Good. He could go hang out with Ned and MJ and then send Tony a message, something about seeing his invitation too late and already making plans with friends.</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to step into the caf\u00e9 only minutes later, to find his friends hiding in the booth in the back, accompanied by\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hey kid! What a coincidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Peter demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the usual,\u201d Tony said, lazily reclining in his seat. \u201cExpanding my horizons, hanging out with teenagers\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if the papzz come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never suspect I\u2019m here again. They know only an idiot would go back to the exact same place where he was cornered last time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>why </em>are you <em>here</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shrugged. \u201cPepper abandoned me, like an old toy at the second hand store. Went on a trip to one of those countries where it\u2019s cold and the people are miserable so they just sit around inventing new technology all the time. I\u2019m all by myself. Just need two misguided robbers and I could re-enact the <em>Home Alone </em>franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Peter said. \u201cWell, first off, thanks for moving your pity party into my caf\u00e9.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually <em>my </em>caf\u00e9, I\u2019ll remind you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair point.\u201d Realizing how awkward he looked, just standing next to the table, Peter reluctantly sagged into the booth next to MJ. \u201cIs this a set-up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked, stirring her milkshake with her straw, \u201cwhy would we have a reason to set you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>This was definitely a set-up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Peter an Avenger now?\u201d Ned excitedly asked Tony.</p>\n<p>Tony clearly struggled with a response for a while. \u201cWhy would be he?\u201d he then asked in a polite voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey both know about the spider-thing,\u201d Peter informed him. \u201cI told them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe figured it out,\u201d MJ corrected him.</p>\n<p>Tony narrowed his eyes at Ned. \u201cThat reminds me. You\u2019re the one who hacked my training wheels protocol, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ned immediately denied, eyes wide. \u201cNo, no no \u2013 really \u2013 that was..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn impressive feat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Ned. \u201cWell then, yeah, it was me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tony cradled his coffee cup. \u201cthen I see Peter\u2019s sidekick-position has already been filled by you two musketeers.\u201d</p>\n<p>The comment somehow stung, and Peter wasn\u2019t sure why. And Tony didn\u2019t even have the decency to move on to a less grating topic. Instead, he addressed Peter directly and bluntly: \u201cSo. You didn\u2019t respond to my message.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-hm,\u201d Peter said slowly, giving himself some time to think. He needed a proper excuse. Something diplomatic and plausible and specific enough that no one would doubt it was the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, he needed to get better at making excuses.</p>\n<p>A short silence fell.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta go pee,\u201d MJ abruptly announced. She turned her piercing gaze on Ned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Yeah, me too,\u201d Ned said, clearly catching on. \u201cLike, ready to burst. And poo, too. Might take a while, I\u2019ve had <em>major </em>constipa-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you ruined it,\u201d MJ said, reaching out and tugging at his arm. \u201cJust come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>They left.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the general level of subtlety amongst teenagers, it\u2019s a damn miracle you managed to keep your secrets for so long,\u201d Tony said. His tone was light, but his eyes were steady as he gazed at Peter across his coffee cup.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t respond. Not because he was trying to be an asshole. Just because he couldn\u2019t figure out why his was finding this whole situation so hard to deal with.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I may have upset you when I said the sidekick-role would fit me better,\u201d Tony continued. \u201cIt was mostly a joke, but I don\u2019t think you took it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it,\u201d Peter slowly said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Tony said, setting his coffee cup down. \u201cWhat you mean is, that\u2019s not the reason why you\u2019ve been avoiding me like the plague these last few weeks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Yeah,\u201d Peter said, because there was no point denying at this point. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you embarrassed about faceplanting on my kitchen floor? Because, you know, that looked pretty embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter scowled. \u201cThanks dude. And, no. That\u2019s not it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you unhappy about the scholarship? Or about the new suit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Peter instantly denied, cringing as he realized how rude he had actually been, avoiding Tony after everything the man had done for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThen how about we play a different game where I stop guessing and you just tell me? Because I wasn\u2019t planning on going anywhere unless you give me a good reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>The comment strongly reminded Peter of the sort of things his uncle Ben used to say, and as an unexpected surge of memories washed over him, he suddenly found a way to put his feelings into words. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 When I said that thing about you being a mentor, it\u2019s as if I heard my uncle\u2019s voice in my head going \u2018<em>what about meeee?\u2019</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nodded. \u201cHe was a good guy, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bestest. You\u2019ve got some pretty big shoes to fill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d Tony said. \u201cBut, uhm, I\u2019m gonna bring my own shoes. So his can stay where they are. You\u2019ll simply have three pairs of shoes now, instead of two. Maybe expand the shoe rack a little. Two inches either side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I took the analogy too far.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Peter got it, though. It was pretty silly to think that he couldn\u2019t accept another mentor figure into his life, or that Ben wouldn\u2019t have wanted him to ask for help at times. \u201cI really want to come to the tower again,\u201d he admitted. Because he <em>did</em>. \u201cAnd hang out and build my suit and talk about solar distillation. Thank you, Tony. Thanks for not letting me ignore you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be a pretty shitty mentor if I bailed at the first sign of teenager stubbornness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled. Tony was good at this. This was going to be okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Tony said. He reached into the bag he had left next to his seat, and pulled out a cardboard tube. He popped the lid off and out came a thin, very fine sheet of paper. Tony turned it over and towards Peter. \u201cOne of the final sketches I made for the mural painting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter carefully pulled the sketch closer. It was all there. The smiling faces. Ben\u2019s eyes looking up at him. And the colors popped even more on paper.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d Peter said with a soft smile. \u201cThanks for showing it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, kid. That\u2019s for you to keep. If you want it, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter resisted the urge to immediately hug the piece of paper to his chest. Whatever lingering doubts he still had about Tony and Ben and what it would all mean for him, floated away into the air, and he was left with only a strangely peaceful feeling. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glanced down at the sketch again. Ben smiled back at him. <em>It\u2019s okay</em>, his eyes said.<em> I want you to do whatever makes you happy.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo \u2026 can I come to the tower next weekend?\u201d Peter ventured.</p>\n<p>Tony frowned a little as he thought. \u201cI actually have to attend another expo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I come? I kinda missed the last one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony cocked his head as he considered that question. \u201cAre you sure you want to be seen in public with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pretty famous, you know. You might get kidnapped for ransom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t get kidnapped,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI got homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll have much say in the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoint taken. But maybe that wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Some poor dweebs who think they\u2019re kidnapping a defenseless teen, and then instead they get <em>me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you imagine I explain you to the press who will inevitably ask questions? Shall I introduce you as Spider-Man or as the kid-genius who is co-writing my paper on solar distillation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Peter said. \u201cWe hit them with so many wild theories that in the end, no one will know what is actually going on. One paper will print that I\u2019m your long lost half-brother from a dwarf-planet, where people never grow past a size of 5 feet 6. Another one will say I\u2019m you, from the past: The result of a time-travel experiment gone wrong. And a third one will say I\u2019m Bob, an orphan who saved your life when you almost choked on a peanut, and who has now wormed his way into your heart <em>Annie</em>-style.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really want to go with \u2018Bob\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s your main concern with the plan, I think we\u2019re pretty much on the same page.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we get papers to print this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just write it ourselves. What\u2019s one more secret identity? \u2018By Michelle Leeds; your local freelance journalist\u2019. Send it to the papers. Include a picture. I bet you they\u2019ll <em>pay</em> us to publish it. Let me go get MJ, she\u2019ll take the picture for us!\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Steve said the next weekend at the dinner table. Peter and Tony, who had been sitting at the table with him, endlessly bickering over something called \u2018solar stills\u2019, whatever that was, finally broke off their discussion to look in his direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey wrote an article about the two of you,\u201d Steve continued, laying the newspaper flat on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s wildly inaccurate. And there\u2019s a picture of the two of you. Together. In some caf\u00e9.\u201d He frowned as he scrutinized the page. \u201cIt\u2019s taken from really close by. Some journalist has definitely been following you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Peter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s all they would say on the matter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
