  "notes": "<p>Merry Christmas to all! I had a lot of fun writing this, and am proud to say it is now the longest work in the series! <br>And as much as I wrote this story to be a gift to you...it contains more gifts inside! Hints of what is to come are sprinkled within this story, as a promise from me to you of what will come with the coming year. See if you can spot them all! ;D</p>\n<p>Note: This isn't the next work in the timeline. It takes place during the break between second and third term of their first year! (Aka there's at *least* a month's difference from where we are normally, giving time for many of the changes you will notice!)</p>\n<p>With that said, please enjoy the fic! &lt;3</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>And there we have it! This is the final installment of 2020, but don't be alarmed! More will be coming in 2021, though I don't know quite how frequently. I'll be taking on classes that require more of my time next semester for my college courses, and my AP classes are always rather time-consuming...but as I only plan to work on my priority fics (this series and Skvader), I should be fairly consistent!</p>\n<p>So one last time for the year, let me ask...what did you think? Any thoughts, comments, questions? If you have a suggestion for a future piece, leave it in the comments! I take what you guys say to heart, truly, and I love to know what you all have to say!</p>\n<p>Have a merry, blessed day, and until next time, au revoir! &lt;3</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<span>The students of 1-A are at ease and filled with mirth, hearts warm and content, and so too are the dorms that they reside in. Energy fills the air, a crackling not unlike the electricity that Denki Kaminari or Izuku Midoriya emit, and sound follows wherever the feeling goes. Teachers, too, roam the halls, boxes in their arms or cups grasped in their hands, much like the students that bustle around.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because the holidays are approaching, and although the students of 1-A do not celebrate the religion of the festivities, they still enjoy partaking in the fun that comes with the holiday known best as Christmas.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the first step? Well, that would have to be decorations.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There are plenty to put up, too. Store bought supplies fill the boxes that teachers and students alike carry in their arms, but handmade decorations are already strewn over couches, and pieces made by arm or by leg via Creation Quirk do the same, glass baubles or replacement lights resting carefully on tabletops. A tree waits in a corner, branches ready to be fluffed and decorated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All in all, there is much to be done, but let it not be said that 1-A is not up to the task.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, the twenty students are more than ready to get to work. They split into groups easily, deciding on tasks. Yaoyorozu leads the charge on decorating the walls, Sero by her side, elbows at the ready, with Asui, Jirou, and Kouda ready for instruction. Iida and Tokoyami focus on cleaning; Iida because he knew that no one else would want to, Tokoyami because Dark Shadow was a bit too excited by the shine of the ornaments for the bird-headed boy\u2019s taste. Shouji, Ojirou, and Satou are carrying in the rest of the boxes, and making sure that nothing is in the way. Hagakure, Kaminari, Uraraka, Aoyama, and Ashido are all in charge of decorating the tree, although currently they seem to be caught in a debate on whether or not the star can be replaced by a picture of Aoyama\u2019s face. Kirishima and Bakugou are in the kitchen, taking stock of what they have in the pantry, and trying to find out what else that they need.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the final three? Well\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shinsou and Todoroki are tasked with trying to find Midoriya, because the boy disappeared not ten minutes ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you checked underneath the tree?\u201d Jirou asks, when Shinsou comes back into the common room with a distressed look on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s not under the tree,\u201d Aizawa comments immediately, an eyebrow raised as he drinks from his coffee mug. Yagi snorts from his seat, accidentally jostling his own cup of tea. Yamada, for his part, offers a cheeky grin and adds, \u201cAizawa checked.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa rolls his eyes, a huff of air escaping him. \u201cPlease. As if anyone would actually check in the tree.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust did!\u201d Kaminari chirps, unearthing himself from where he had been buried within the branches of the fake tree. \u201cMidoriya is </span>\n<em>\n<span>definitely</span>\n</em>\n<span> not in there!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you check the top?\u201d Todoroki asks, and Kaminari\u2019s eyes widen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit, no! Thanks Todoroki, let me just\u2026.\u201d and to Aizawa\u2019s disbelief, the boy shoves his head back into the tree, body shifting as he presumably looks around. Aizawa chooses to turn a blind eye this time, instead staring blankly at Yamada, who struggles to hold in his laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But just as Aizawa looks away, laughter begins to ring through the hall. Heads turn to see the exact green-haired boy that they were looking for, Midoriya, racing through the halls, Monoma right behind him, laughing as they chase after...a dog.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSweetpea!\u201d Midoriya calls, but the name is broken with his giggling. \u201cSweetpea, come on!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sweetpea, as she\u2019s named, simply jumps onto the couch, content to curl up next to Yagi and pant, tongue hanging out as her mouth opens into a smile of sorts. Yagi smiles, a hand reaching down to pat the dog\u2019s head as Midoriya approaches, slowing his pace as he gets closer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSweetpea!\u201d Midoriya says, perhaps trying to sound scolding but failing, his smile too wide to let his tone be anything but amused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe ran off from Kan-sensei,\u201d Monoma explains, falling into place by Midoriya\u2019s side, a hand reaching out to pet Sweetpea. \u201cHer collar was too loose, and she got a little excited.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe probably heard the noise being made in here,\u201d Midoriya guesses, glancing around at all of the decorations, pausing as he spots Kaminari. \u201cAh, Kaminari? Why is your head in the tree?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLooking for Mido- oh! Midoriya! You\u2019re back!\u201d Kaminari pulls his head out once more, hair messier than before, earning a confused look from Midoriya in response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. Where can I help?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWant to move the couch for us?\u201d Hagakure asks. \u201cWe want to get people closer to the tree!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, sure!\u201d Midoriya says, and Uraraka turns, moving closer as she lifts her hands, ready to lighten the couch, and kick her teachers off of the furniture.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only to pause, because Midoriya is already holding up the couch, lifting it high above his head and smiling obliviously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere do you need it, exactly?\u201d Midoriya asks, ignorant to the silence of the room.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMido?\u201d Ashido asks in lieu of responding, and Midoriya tilts his head. \u201cYou...you do know that Aizawa-sensei and Yamada-sensei are still on the couch, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And indeed they are, the two teachers clutching their drinks just a little bit tighter as they try not to shift around, not wanting to be the reason that Midoriya drops them. But Midoriya just blinks at Ashido before nodding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course!\u201d Then, worried, \u201cOh! Did you two want off the couch? I can set you down, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid </span>\n<em>\n<span>we</span>\n</em>\n<span>-\u201d Yamada begins to wheeze, voice rising, but Aizawa cuts him off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Aizawa says, voice calmer than he feels. \u201cJust put the couch where it needs to be.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGot it! Where to, Hagakure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hagakure gestures vaguely, but it seems to be enough for Midoriya because he happily moves the couch, setting the furniture and his teachers down without complaint.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know what,\u201d Monoma says, after the silence stretches on for forty long seconds, \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to...go.\u201d Picking up Sweetpea, he mutters, \u201cI preferred it when Midoriya was acting as me, instead of...whatever </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> was. Fucking overpowered protagonist-like nerd, why do I even-\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of Monoma\u2019s remark is lost, the boy shutting the dorm\u2019s door behind him. Another beat of silence fills the air, and then Kaminari softly murmurs, \u201cI still think Midoriya did better as Snipe. That was his best role.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And chaos breaks out at last.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way,\u201d Uraraka disagrees. \u201cDeku was so much better as Present Mic!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think he did really well as All Might,\u201d Ojirou pipes up as he sets down a box, offering a shrug and a smile. \u201cI mean, we all saw his face during that!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd the fake blood was pretty cool!\u201d Kirishima agrees, and then pauses. \u201cThat </span>\n<em>\n<span>was</span>\n</em>\n<span> fake, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya smiles, but doesn\u2019t answer. The conversation continues too quickly for Kirishima to fully notice this, with Ashido scoffing and shouting, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>! It was when Midori was Aizawa! I mean, come </span>\n<em>\n<span>on</span>\n</em>\n<span>! That was the best!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt did catch us off guard,\u201d Iida admits, a hand coming up to hold his chin. \u201cAfter all, it was the first assignment Midoriya did by himself. We had all assumed that the assignments ended with the single event, so Midoriya\u2019s appearance was rather shocking.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he expelled the grape,\u201d Hagakure murmurs, and some of her peers nod along with satisfaction.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI also have to agree that Aizawa was one of the best,\u201d Shinsou says at that, now leaning against a wall. \u201cGot me into 1-A faster.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you never saw it!\u201d Uraraka protests. \u201cSo how can you vote for Midozawa if you weren\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>there</span>\n</em>\n<span>!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Shinsou murmurs, and then says, \u201cAlright. I guess my favorite was uh...who was the yellow caped man?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no,\u201d Iida, Todoroki, and Yagi say at once, eyes widening in sync.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, that guy,\u201d Shinsou says with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen class rep. so terrified. It was great.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShinsou!\u201d Iida shouts. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly a reason to approve of Midoriya\u2019s acting!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis Nedzu impression made half of the teachers look ready to quit,\u201d Jirou pipes up. \u201cI think Mic-sensei almost cried.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did,\u201d Yamada murmurs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m pretty sure every teacher ditched classes when Midoriya was Midn-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d Aizawa cuts in, and Kaminari closes his mouth, nodding quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI liked seeing him as Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki murmurs. \u201cHe looked good in the costume.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s because my costume is the best!\u201d Bakugou shouts from the pantry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, he\u2019s just-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about that, either,\u201d Aizawa cuts in, eyes narrowed, and Todoroki wisely closes his mouth as well, but not before letting out a quiet laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about you, Midoriya?\u201d Asui asks. \u201cWhich assignment was the most fun for you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh!\u201d Midoriya perks up, eyes widening with delight. \u201cWell, it had to be when I was-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Ding!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh! My cookies are done!\u201d Satou exclaims. \u201cI\u2019m trying out a new recipe for the party, who wants to try one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe!\u201d Hands fly into the air, and tasks are forgotten as the students of 1-A follow Satou into the kitchen, eager for treats.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yes, the day is off to a wonderful start. And in just a few short days, the party will be worth the preparation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the night before the party, and Shouto Todoroki is heading to his dorm, ready to sleep after the long day that has just passed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A fun day, surely, but also a tiring one. Even now, Todoroki\u2019s hands tingle, half of him bordering on that oddly prickling numbness that only long sessions of Quirk usage can bring him. But Todoroki can\u2019t complain, not when using his cold side to try creating snow for Midoriya earned the dual-toned boy that bright-eyed joy that Midoriya gives him so freely and openly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So maybe Todoroki is tired, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the rush of energy that he felt when Midoriya beamed at him, eyes shut from the force of his happiness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Distracted by thoughts of the green-haired boy, Todoroki doesn\u2019t notice the person following him until they grab him by the arm, yanking him into a room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Turning around, Todoroki is surprised to find himself face to face with a determined-looking Uraraka.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUraraka?\u201d Todoroki asks, and is given a mischief-filled smile in return.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Uraraka cheers, as if she is surprised to see him despite being the one to pull him aside. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m...well. Did you need something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! But I know what </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> need!\u201d And then, with a flourish, Uraraka pulls out a plant with red berries and green leaves.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFood?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo!\u201d Uraraka shakes the plant in front of his face, then shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s mistletoe, Todoroki! You kiss people when you stand under it with them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Todoroki glances up at the mistletoe, and then at her. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really want to kiss you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh kami\u2026.Todoroki, I don\u2019t want to kiss you,\u201d Uraraka says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Thank y</span>\n</em>\n<span>- Todoroki, you want to kiss Midoriya, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki doesn\u2019t think that he can be blamed for how half of his body immediately lights up, fire brightening up the room and forcing Uraraka to jump back. Luckily, he manages to extinguish himself just as quickly, now covered in ice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki says, calmly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uraraka stares at the frosted boy, then sighs. Regaining her game face, she nods and says, \u201cAlright! So, if you want to get that kiss-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWithout Aizawa-sensei killing me,\u201d Todoroki interrupts, and Uraraka nods along.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Without</span>\n</em>\n<span> Aizawa-sensei killing you,\u201d Uraraka adds in. \u201cThen here\u2019s what you need to do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In Todoroki\u2019s defense, he only sets himself on fire four more times during the discussion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And as Todoroki falls asleep, he hopes that tomorrow will go as planned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day of the party begins early, but only for two people. Katsuki Bakugou and Izuku Midoriya move around the kitchen, caught in their own rhythm as they prepare for the day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLearn how to cook,\u201d Bakugou mutters to himself, voice filled with loathing as he pulls out the recipe books that are well-used and worn down, carried by him since his childhood. \u201cIt\u2019ll be calming, they said. You\u2019ll be relaxed, they said!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo one said that,\u201d Midoriya murmurs, quieter than Bakugou for once as he makes his way from the pantry to the stove, setting things down on the counter. \u201cAnd besides, we don\u2019t have to start cooking until later. If we had pulled out everything earlier-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs if we </span>\n<em>\n<span>could</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Bakugou cuts in. \u201cPlease, Sugar High was too busy baking his fucking goods, he would\u2019ve just gotten a mess on our stuff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya snorts. \u201cAlright, Kacchan. But still. It\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever. Just make sure to be down here in time, I\u2019m not doing all of the work without you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of missing it, Kacchan,\u201d Midoriya responds, and then the two fall back into silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time that anyone comes down, the boys will be gone, no one around to see the moment of perfect cohabitation that the two had created.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later, however, all will see the peace between the two, the ease with which each boy moves around the others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it will be clear that maybe, just maybe, the boys are on their way to a beautiful friendship. Their past may always linger, but their future can be brighter, better.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Miracles do come true; they just need a bit of work put into them first.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Bakugou has put in plenty of work, which Midoriya sees clearly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yes, the day will be wonderful, and it starts off this way as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki watches as Midoriya moves around the common room, shifting couches and tables this way and that. Iida had asked him to do so, Todoroki recalls, because Aizawa had warned them that a few extra people would be coming over.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Who, exactly, Todoroki is unsure of. He wonders if any of them are Aizawa\u2019s friends...does the man </span>\n<em>\n<span>have</span>\n</em>\n<span> more friends?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki thinks it\u2019s wise not to ask. Or, at least, not to ask his teacher. Midoriya, however, probably knows. He knows a lot, especially now that he\u2019s done so much research for his acting assignments.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>...Yeah, Todoroki is curious enough to inquire. So as Midoriya dances around the common room, flitting between pieces of furniture, Todoroki walks into the room and over to the green-haired boy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Todoroki greets, and Midoriya startles, whipping around before beaming brightly at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Midoriya cheers, task forgotten in his excitement. \u201cDo you need help with anything?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes Aizawa-sensei have any friends?\u201d Todoroki asks in response, and Midoriya pauses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI- what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes he have any friends?\u201d Todoroki asks. \u201cOther than Mic-sensei, that is. Or any of the staff, actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya blinks at him oddly, tilting his head slightly as he gathers his thoughts. \u201cOf course he does,\u201d Midoriya answers, confident and sure of his words, and Todoroki believes him. \u201cThe detective seems to be a friend, for one. I\u2019m sure that Aizawa considers multiple of his coworkers friends as well, even if they are not as close as Yamada-sensei and Kayama-sensei are with him. Why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Todoroki admits easily, and Midoriya laughs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, Todoroki! Are you ready for tonight?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Todoroki says with a nod, and Midoriya smiles even wider.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat! I\u2019m really excited! I think Aizawa said that Eri is coming over, and it\u2019s going to be her first Christmas! And I know Yagi is bringing over a few people so...oh. Oh no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Todoroki asks, and Midoriya lets out a sigh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll of Yagi\u2019s friends are </span>\n<em>\n<span>tall</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Midoriya looks around, glancing at the set up. \u201cI accounted for leg room for students, and even for Aizawa and Yamada, but\u2026\u201d Another sigh, and then Midoriya nods to himself, determination taking over. \u201cRight! I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya walks away, starting to readjust some of the seats to properly distance them from the tables, and Todoroki watches with silent admiration for another moment before turning to leave the room, so that he is no longer in the way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only to spot a mix of red and green on the ceiling, right above where he and Midoriya were standing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh come </span>\n<em>\n<span>on</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The party begins not with a bang, nor a rush, but rather a slow trickle of students entering the common room, one by one or two by two, dressed in festive hats and matching coats, bundled in red, white, green, and even blue. Friends compliment each other on their outfits, talk about the winters of the past, and find spots to sit in. Some roam the room, still giddy over the lights on the wall, the decorations on the tree, the warmth of joy in the air. Still others go so far as the kitchen, where Midoriya, Bakugou, and Satou claim their own spots, Satou furthest across the area. They offer their assistance, and are denied as patiently as the speaker can be. The work for the day is nearly done, and now is the time to relish in this truth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first teacher to come is Yamada, unsurprisingly, the man eager as he walks in, carrying a box with treats inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood evening, listeners!\u201d Yamada cries. \u201cI brought some food!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d Yaoyorozu says, always one to be polite. \u201cI can bring those to the kitchen if you\u2019d like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, but thanks! You just enjoy yourself, alright?\u201d Getting a nod from the vice representative, Yamada happily enters the kitchen area, earning a smile from Midoriya and Satou, and a side glance from Bakugou before the boy goes back to his work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNeed any help?\u201d Yamada asks as he places his container down, careful to keep it out of the way, and receives three headshakes in response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo thank you, Yamada-sensei,\u201d Midoriya says, half-distracted by what he\u2019s doing. \u201cSatou will probably be done in the next fifteen minutes, and Kacchan and I won\u2019t be much longer! You can go ahead and find a spot to sit, if you\u2019d like!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, sprout,\u201d Yamada responds, then listens to the boy\u2019s directions, taking a seat and letting the other students- namely Kaminari and Sero- pull him into a conversation about English memes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Up next comes Aizawa with Eri, who pulls away from Aizawa the moment she spots Midoriya. She does not get kicked out of the kitchen, unsurprisingly, but rather follows Midoriya around like a duckling would its mother, eyes sparkling with an intense curiosity as she watches him move. The students of 1-A coo at this, some less subtly than others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The last three to trickle in are Yagi and his two guests. Tsukauchi and Sasaki follow the blond man inside, earning a round of greetings as they take off their shoes and coats. Yagi and Sasaki move over to the couches, where students greet them, some with warmth and others with interest as to who the green and yellow haired man may be, while Tsukauchi moves closer to the kitchen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As if on cue, Midoriya\u2019s head lifts just as Tsukauchi reaches his area, and the boy smiles as he says, \u201cOh! Detective Tsukauchi, how have you been?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tsukauchi smiles at the kid, offering a shrug as he says, \u201cSame as usual.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike Aizawa-sensei?\u201d Midoriya asks, which is merely the polite way to say \u2018tired and drinking </span>\n<em>\n<span>far</span>\n</em>\n<span> too much caffeine\u2019, and Tsukauchi lets out a laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly like him. How have you been, sport?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Suddenly, Tsukauchi feels eyes glaring down on him, gazes intense at the mention of such a familial nickname. It\u2019s worth it, though.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Definitely worth it, even if he can feel his Quirk being erased. Tsukauchi will never grow tired of messing with the dads of this green-haired prodigy.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been well!\u201d Midoriya says, as if no one is trying to kill Tsukauchi with their glare alone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose assignments haven\u2019t been too time-consuming, huh?\u201d Tsukauchi asks, and Midoriya shakes his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope! Has work?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt always is,\u201d Tsukauchi jokes, and Midoriya laughs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The glaring stops, and Tsukauchi huffs out a laugh of his own. Yeah, Tsukauchi is happy to spend his evening here, where he can see his blond twig of a friend and his honorary nephew all at once.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFood is done, nerd,\u201d Bakugou says, and Midoriya perks up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerfect! Everyone, come eat!\u201d Midoriya says, and no one even considers disobeying the teenager\u2019s orders, happy enough to listen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so the party goes on, happy and lively and just right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dinner finishes slowly but surely, with empty plates and matching cups, and smiles to be shared all around. A few of the students, those who felt they did less preparations than others, or perhaps just felt like helping, gather the dishes, washing them while the rest of the group slowly moves back to the common room.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And oh, isn\u2019t it a sight to see. Presents are poured out around the Christmas tree, and the students of 1-A take delight in how Eri stares in wide-eyed wonder at the pile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Eri asks, and Midoriya smiles down at her, sitting next to the girl on the couch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift exchange,\u201d Midoriya explains. \u201cPeople bring gifts, and then we all receive one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSome people call it a \u2018secret santa\u2019 event, kero,\u201d Asui adds on. \u201cEveryone got assigned someone else.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t get anyone?\u201d Eri points out, but Aizawa cuts in before Midoriya can try to comfort the girl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did, Eri,\u201d Aizawa promises. \u201cWe went shopping for them just last week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Then, suddenly, Eri lights up, eyes widening as she asks, \u201cI get to give </span>\n<em>\n<span>him</span>\n</em>\n<span> the secret santa?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did!\u201d Yamada confirms. \u201cBut he still has to wait a few more moments before he can know, alright? It\u2019s part of the fun!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eri looks at Midoriya at that statement, eyes shining with confusion, but she nods along when Midoriya gives a nod of his own.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright!\u201d Determined, Eri nods once more. \u201cI\u2019ll give it to him first, though!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat we can do!\u201d Yamada assures, and Midoriya smiles at the joy in the girl\u2019s expression as she bounces over to the pile of presents, clearly searching for the one she remembers picking out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s grown,\u201d Midoriya murmurs, watching as Eri tugs a bag out of the pile, hoisting it up. \u201cShe\u2019s happier.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s gained a muttering habit,\u201d Aizawa comments idly. \u201cWhen she\u2019s really happy, she talks as fast as you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTaking after her older brother, huh?\u201d Shinsou asks, dropping onto the floor in front of Midoriya, who stares at the boy, bewildered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOlder...brother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou,\u201d Todoroki says, blunt as always as he steals the spot beside Midoriya, and Midoriya laughs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI always did want a little sibling,\u201d Midoriya admits, to which Shinsou snorts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you picked one out for yourself, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust like he picked out his da-\u201d Todoroki\u2019s comment is cut off by a scarred elbow jabbing him in the stomach, but the intention is already clear. Midoriya blushes as Aizawa stares at them, unblinking as his expression remains blank.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then, calmly, \u201cShe called you her brother just two days ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Aizawa gets up and walks over to Eri, leaving Midoriya to be a mess on his own.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell said, from Eri\u2019s dad,\u201d Shinsou teases. \u201cI guess you\u2019re officially his kid, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s been official for a long time,\u201d Todoroki mutters, and Midoriya turns red all over again. But this time he can\u2019t fix his flustered state in time, Eri approaching with the bag.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry Christmas, Deku!\u201d Eri cheers, shoving the bag at him. \u201cHere\u2019s your santa!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Eri,\u201d Midoriya says, sincere as he carefully takes the gift from her hands.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOpen it!\u201d Eri urges immediately, and Midoriya nods along, already taking out the gift paper on top, and pulling out the item inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or, rather, the </span>\n<em>\n<span>first</span>\n</em>\n<span> item. Because there are three things, from what Midoriya can feel, that are inside the bag.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first is a camera. It\u2019s a cute one, painted a light green, and made to print off pictures the moment he takes them. Simple but sweet, Midoriya assures Eri that he\u2019ll use it as soon as he gets the chance to.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The second is a...box? Well, it\u2019s a rather nice looking case, Midoriya will give it that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Aizawa says, and Midoriya nods, unlatching the box and opening the top.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh. It\u2019s filled with products. Makeup, brushes, and even some small things of hair dye. And while some of the products seem cheaper, Midoriya can tell that others are very good quality- he\u2019s seen some of these being carried by Yaoyorozu once or twice, and he knows that she\u2019d only want the best for her money\u2019s worth, after all. The box- er, makeup case- alone is probably worth more than his teacher should have spent, so-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift from all of your teachers, too,\u201d Aizawa explains, and Midoriya blinks up at him in surprise. \u201cThe camera was from Eri, she said that she saw pictures on your wall, and wanted to give you something for that. The products are from Mic, Midnight, and\u2026.Snipe, actually. Cementoss and Power Loader designed the case so it could hold more weight, and Ectoplasm recommended the dyes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Midoriya whispers, ignoring the fact that, well...he doesn\u2019t even know if Ectoplasm </span>\n<em>\n<span>has</span>\n</em>\n<span> hair underneath his costume. \u201cI\u2019ll have to thank them, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe last one is from Nedzu, All Might, and myself,\u201d Aizawa says, just as Midoriya reaches in and pulls out an envelope. The green-haired boy rips it open carefully, and pulls out the paper within.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only to pause in surprise. Because these aren\u2019t just papers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re tickets.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To </span>\n<em>\n<span>HeroCon</span>\n</em>\n<span>. The biggest event for hero fanatics in all of Japan, where cosplayers and die-hard fans meet and get to bond over great heroes and the community they\u2019ve sparked, and some heroes even </span>\n<em>\n<span>show up</span>\n</em>\n<span> to host panels and talks and meet and greets and-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Thank you</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Midoriya whispers, and Aizawa snorts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we\u2019re giving you these assignments, we might as well give you the resources to make it better for you,\u201d Aizawa says, but Midoriya sees the smile that he\u2019s hiding in his capture weapon. Offering a grin to Eri, he lets Aizawa\u2019s excuse pass, nodding along before peering at the girl who stares right back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Eri,\u201d Midoriya says softly. \u201cI love it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was a good secret santa?\u201d Eri asks, and Midoriya nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe best,\u201d he assures, and Eri beams before lunging at him, hugging him tightly. Midoriya hugs back immediately, blinking away the happy tears that try to form.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tears that inevitably fall, but with laughter joining in, when Tokoyami reveals Eri to be his giftee by handing her a sword that is twice her size. The look on Aizawa\u2019s face is enough to coax the sound right out of him, and Aizawa shoots him a heatless glare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m disowning you,\u201d Aizawa mutters, but then he reaches out and pats Midoriya on the head, and Midoriya knows that it\u2019s been a wonderful day, with many more to come.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGoodbye, Sir! Goodnight, Yagi!\u201d Midoriya says, and Yagi and Sasaki both return the farewells before exiting the dorms and walking away, leaving Midoriya standing at the entrance. Midoriya smiles, watching as they go. Even now, he\u2019s still glad that the two were able to repair their past friendship. It would have been a shame if they never got the chance, but they </span>\n<em>\n<span>did</span>\n</em>\n<span> and that\u2019s what matters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get cold if you stand out here,\u201d Todoroki says, now standing besides Midoriya. \u201cUnless you have a heat Quirk of your own?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Midoriya promises with a smile. \u201cThough I know it\u2019d be useful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can...stand closer to me, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Todoroki offers, lifting up his arm, and Midoriya grins wider before slipping into place, basking in the boy\u2019s warmth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re like a heater,\u201d Midoriya notes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you,\u201d Todoroki responds, and then, slowly, \u201cI think.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s good!\u201d Midoriya assures, shifting closer. \u201cDefinitely good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence fills the air, but it\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s peaceful, calming, like a blanket of comfort draped in the space that surrounds them. Midoriya and Todoroki watch the area before them, watch how Yagi and Sasaki drift further out of sight with every passing moment, two figures going into the night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToday was nice,\u201d Todoroki says, speaking up, brushing away the quiet but not quite breaking it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had a day like today. It\u2019s always rather quiet at home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis was new for me, too,\u201d Midoriya says in turn. \u201cIn the past, it was always my mom and I when it came time for celebrations. But today...it\u2019s like finding a second family, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is.\u201d A pause, and then, slyly, \u201cA family that gives you two fathers and multiple aunts and uncles, yeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Laughing, Midoriya nudges the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to let me live that down, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>have</span>\n</em>\n<span> to be related to one of them,\u201d Todoroki says, standing his ground. \u201cI just can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s All Might or Aizawa. You\u2019re equally like both of them, although I don\u2019t know which is more terrifying when they\u2019re focused on being your parent.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTerrifying?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Todoroki just gives him a look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOne day, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Todoroki says vaguely, and Midoriya snorts. Silence falls once more, a pleasant lull in the conversation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then, suddenly, Midoriya turns, glancing upwards before smiling at Todoroki.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that look for?\u201d Todoroki asks, but Midoriya simply leans in, planting a kiss on the boy\u2019s cheek before slipping out of his grasp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI should go check on Eri,\u201d Midoriya says softly, and then he disappears back inside, leaving Todoroki alone, doing his best not to set the entrance on fire as he tries to understand what just happened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then, as Todoroki tries to calm his racing heart, he notices something above him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dangling from the doorway, a lone sprig of mistletoe hangs above his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki whispers, before touching his cheek. A smile creeps onto his face, soft and full of love.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems that Uraraka\u2019s plan worked, after all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta watches his students as they leave the common room, one by one. The other adults are long gone, by now, either heading back home or to the teachers\u2019 dorms, where another party awaits- one that will inevitably be more chaotic, and will last much longer into the night. Shouta doesn\u2019t mind missing the beginning, not at all, content to watch Hizashi and Yagi head off without him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, Shouta does not mind at all. Not as he sees his students whisper soft goodnights to one another, nor when he sees Asui lead Eri away, off to a sleepover with the other girls, a way to keep the young girl away from the party-induced chaos that will inevitably occur. He simply watches them go on their own merry ways, some more quickly than the rest, until at last the room is still and he sees no one else moving.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Only then, when the air is calm and the dorms are silent, does Shouta move to leave, standing up from where he had leaned against the counter, heading into the common room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And this is when Shouta huffs out a laugh, a smile slipping onto his face as he sees a familiar green head of hair poking over the couch. The boy is fast asleep, curled into the side of an also sleeping Todoroki. The two look calm and content, worn out from the day of excitement that has gone on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Moving silently, Shouta grabs a blanket from the couch, one that is a blur of green, red, and white, and drapes it over the two students. Izuku shifts at the sudden weight, eyes squeezing shut before blinking open slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAizawa?\u201d The boy asks, head tilting, unconsciously leaning more into his classmate.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust go to sleep, kiddo,\u201d Shouta says, and Izuku nods before shutting his eyes, head dropping back down, eyes closing once more. Shouta smiles, heart warming at the ease that Izuku falls asleep, that the boy is relaxed enough to do so. Without thinking about it, Shouta can\u2019t help but lean forward, patting the boy\u2019s hair once, twice, before dropping his hand and backing up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMerry Christmas, Problem Child,\u201d Shouta whispers, and then he leaves the room, and nothing remains except for the crackling of fire, the glow of joys recently passed, his Problem Child and the kid\u2019s admirer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And in the end, that\u2019s the only way that Shouta could ask for the way to end. His students happy, his kid loved, and the day passed without incident.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Merry Christmas</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u2019 Shouta thinks, and the winter night sings the words right back to him.</span>\n</p>"
