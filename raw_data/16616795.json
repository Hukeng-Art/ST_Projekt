He sounded taken aback. \u201c<i>You</i> want <i>me</i> to help fight All Might.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course,\u201d All for One nodded along. \u201cI can offer you double of whatever my counterpart is paying you currently, along with anything your little heart could desire. Of course, you would get to help out drastically\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you happen to <i>check</i> what world you were pulling me out of when you did this?\u201d Midoriya Izuku interrupted and it was said in such an incredulous tone that had the situation not been as critical as it was, All Might would have laughed. </p>\n<p>Also known as: number one hero Deku has been through a lot of things, but being thrust into an alternate reality where he\u2019s All for One\u2019s Successor is a first. He has to navigate this world when his alternate self is a villain who's dead-set on killing him and this version of class 1-A. All the while, his friends search desperately for a way to get him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing, we need to do it soon,\u201d Kirishima said, drumming his fingers on the doorframe. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worried, man. Villains are taking advantage of his leave. We\u2019re all working overtime just to keep the peace and it just\u2026 It just feels kinda empty without him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ochako put a hand on Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know. We have to be strong, though. Deku is counting on us. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d Tenya said with as much conviction as the situation offered. \u201cI <i>promise you</i> we\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wondered how they were going to react to Midoriya, but Midoriya was nowhere to be seen\u2014Aizawa-sensei pulled him away two hours ago and he had yet to return.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, this is gonna be SICK,\u201d Kaminari said suddenly, throwing his bag over his shoulder. He threw open the dorm door and walked inside. Not two seconds later, the door opened again and Kaminari promptly rushed back out and down the steps, looking rather terrified. \u201cMidorishi Izuku is in our dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, so that was where he went.</p>\n<p>\u201cTodoroki! Wait up!\u201d Izuku called. </p>\n<p>Todoroki stopped to glare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku couldn\u2019t help but compare this Todoroki to his Shouto. The mannerisms, the anger, the fear. All of it was so familiar, yet so different.</p>\n<p> Izuku offered a small, sad smile. \u201cYou are not your father. Your fire is not your father\u2019s quirk. Who you are and what you do with your own quirk is up to you. That\u2019s all I wanted to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting at a lot lately. I like you better than my version too,\u201d Izuku doesn\u2019t bother to hide his smile. He can\u2019t help but add on, \u201cThough, you\u2019re missing a couple of hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko looked down at his two perfectly good hands. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku patted his shoulder and started walking off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s better this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-wait! What do you mean I\u2019m missing a couple of hands?!\u201d</p>",

  "text": "<p>The battle raged around them.</p>\n<p>All Might was no stranger to death and even less of a stranger to villains, but watching as the fire curled and spread around Kamino was a devastating blow. The screams of those that were trapped in the rubble echoed around the once bright and cheerful city. Now, homes were reduced to ash and the buildings collapsing as heroes worked desperately against the clock. Bakugo had been rescued and his students ushered to safety, but at a price.</p>\n<p>Gran Torino stood by his side, watching the carnage with sad eyes. This battle had caused too much harm for too many people. Their resources were running out. They didn\u2019t have much time left. If it continued to way that it currently was then\u2014</p>\n<p>The wound that had decimated his body five years ago ached. He thought he was going to die then, too, but that was before he had passed on his quirk.</p>\n<p>That was before he lost the majority of his power.</p>\n<p>In the center of all the chaos All Might could only make out two figures. Against the ash and the smoke and the fire, they stood bright. They chattered, as if the city wasn\u2019t burning, as if people weren\u2019t dying. That without a face and that with a terrifying smile.</p>\n<p>All Might had a history with All for One. Midorishi Izuku, however, was a new player.</p>\n<p>He had first appeared at USJ to attack Aizawa\u2019s students. He\u2019d left his mark when he tore the building down with enormous destructive power. His ability to carry out a plan was horrifyingly fantastic. There had been injuries, but no one died that day.</p>\n<p>It was a very near thing.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t know much about him. They knew he had a destructive quirk\u2014or quirks, if his close relationship to All for One was anything to go by. He had green hair, he liked to carry around as many weapons as he could fit on his person. They knew that he was charismatic and well liked\u00a0 within villain groups. They knew he was smart, they knew he was fast and they knew he was young. No older than All Might\u2019s first year students in UA.</p>\n<p>Much too young to have that sort of smile. To have those sorts of eyes.</p>\n<p>All Might may have saved Shimura Tenko, but even he knew it was too late to save Midorishi Izuku. All for One corrupted everything he touched. That boy was no exception.</p>\n<p>All for One stepped forward. Midorishi stuck out his hand and said, \u201cLet me, Sensei.\u201d</p>\n<p>All for One gestured for Midorishi to walk forward. He does so with no hesitation, teeth bared in what resembled a grin. His loose fitting clothing covered in flecks of dirt and blood. His eyes glowed green in the evening light. He might have been two heads shorter than All for One, but his presence was still the same. These were people who thrived on the death and destruction of the innocent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt would be easier for all of us if you just <em>die</em>, All Might,\u201d Midorishi said. His tone was light and joking but his words were anything but.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I die,\u201d All Might said and paused. His body might be weak, but he was not done yet. Not while there are still people behind him and innocents to be saved. \u201cIf I die, then this city does as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Midorishi said. There\u2019s a playful frown\u2014almost a pout on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>THEN I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN</em>!\u201d All Might roared and he lunged forward. They clash with such force that it sent a shockwave through Kamino. People screamed and cried and begged as they and their homes were blown away by the sheer force of their power.</p>\n<p>All Might could only think of <em>pain</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It attacked his body with devastating force. Creeping up his arm and spreading throughout his limbs. Everything <em>hurt</em>. He couldn\u2019t breathe. For a moment, just a moment, All Might thought that this truly might be his last battle. He closed his eyes as he listened to Midorishi laugh and tried to think of better times.</p>\n<p>Helping thousands of people from the rubble, alive and well. Becoming the Symbol of Peace. Rescuing Tenko and watching as he bloomed into the young hero he was meant to be. Finding Mirio and passing on One for All after Nighteye recommended him. His students at UA, waiting for him to come back. His master\u2019s smile. It was like a mantra in his head. Every person he had saved, every life he had changed, every opportunity they had to live. The peace that he had created.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYour power, All Might? If it means that I can help more people, I would be honored. Please teach me!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cUncle Toshinori? What was my grandma like?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAll Might-sensei! What are we learning today?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u201cYou saved him.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou saved her.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou saved </em>me<em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>All Might could not die.</p>\n<p>Somewhere out there was his successor. Somewhere out there, Mirio was waiting for him to return. Tenko was waiting for his return. His students were waiting for his return. Somewhere out there, he can hear the innocents calling for him. <em>You can do it! You can do it! </em>Even after they all saw his true form, they still believed in him.</p>\n<p>He may have loved his teacher, but he will not be like her.</p>\n<p>He funneled what was left of One for All into his fist and <em>pushed</em>. The familiar power bubbled inside of him, waiting for him to call it forward. His eyes snapped open and he threw his fist as hard as he could until he felt Midorishi\u2019s own power give way. He surged forward and hit his target with a satisfying <em>crack!</em></p>\n<p>Midorishi was send halfway across the city, only landing a few feet from where All for One stood. Midoriya groaned, rolling to his side and promptly spitting out blood. He was no longer smiling, looking at All Might like one would look at a particularly annoying mosquito. All for One tutted but helped up his successor to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this,\u201d All for One said and sighed like it was such an inconvenience.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of things that I had hoped for,\u201d All Might replied in return, his voice a little wheezy.</p>\n<p>All Might tried to steady his breathing, clutching his shattered arm. He had very little One for All left. This battle had gone on for far too long. The only two people left were himself and Gran Torino, who stood faithfully in the rubble of the once great city.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI found a quirk, All Might.\u201d All for One said and he placed a hand on Midorishi\u2019s shoulder to steady him as the boy stumbled. \u201cA quirk called <em>Universe</em>. It\u2019s quite interesting really\u2014a thousand universes, a billion worlds yet we seem to be connected to one in particular. A parallel dimension, you should say.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might glanced at Gran Torino, sharing the expression of growing horror. He did not like where this was going.</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine. Double the people, double the power.\u201d All for One said and laughed. His hand sparked before lighting up in shades of gold and green. \u201cLittle Izuku has always been kind to a poor old soul like me. I\u2019ve wanted to get him some help around here. Who better to help him out then himself?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might felt ice creep up his back. There was no way\u2014that\u2026that was impossible. He rushed forward, but it was already too late. He could only watch as the light in All for One\u2019s hand glowed brighter and brighter until it was impossible to look at. Gran Torino tried to follow, but at that very moment, All for One simply raised his hands and let the power free.</p>\n<p>The explosion that rocked the area sent even a man like All Might stumbling back. He put his hands to cover his eyes as debris and dust were kicked up and blown around. Wind ripped at his baggy costume. He could hardly breathe, couldn\u2019t see, and all he could hear was the ringing of his own ears.</p>\n<p>Except\u2026that wasn\u2019t quite right. There was something else there too\u2014something faint. A voice in the wind. It was familiar in a way, but he couldn\u2019t quite place it.</p>\n<p><em>Whatever you say All Might!</em> the voice said. It\u2019s getting louder, All Might realized. It\u2019s getting louder and it knew his name. <em>I\u2019ll step up to this challenge! As long as you\u2019re by my side, I can do anything. That\u2019s how I feel, anyways.</em></p>\n<p><em>Symbol of peace? </em>A new voice said, whispering in his ear. All Might <em>knew</em> that voice. He listened to it every morning when Tenko greeted him. These, however, were not Tenko\u2019s words.<em> Hah! In the end you\u2019re just a tool for violence, made to keep us down. And violence only breeds more violence.</em></p>\n<p>The first voice came back, <em>A smiling, dependable, cool hero\u2026That\u2019s what I wanna be! That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving it everything. For everyone!</em></p>\n<p>His own voice reached his ears, whispering powerful words.<em> You\u2019re next. </em></p>\n<p>The light and wind rushed back towards the center and exploded with a quick burst of light. The voices faded and All Might could only hear ringing the ringing in his ears as he coughed and rubbed his eyes. By the time the dust had settled, there was a large circle burned in the middle of the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Another Midorishi Izuku sat in the center of it all.</p>\n<p>All Might could only watch in horror as the newcomer staggered to his feet with a groan. This Midorishi did not look like the original\u2014not only did he look older, but he was wearing a bright green track suit covering the entire length of his body. White gloves came up to his elbows and on his hips hung a red belt, each with a pouch on the side. Black support stockings came up to his knees. A silver mouthguard hung from his neck.</p>\n<p>If All Might didn\u2019t know any better, he would have said it looked like a hero costume.</p>\n<p><em>This is your chance to take him out before he\u2019s a threat</em>, a voice whispered in his ear. It made sense, to attack before the enemy can attack him. All Might stepped forward out of habit, but then stopped. Something in his gut told him to wait.</p>\n<p>This Midorishi Izuku blinked dust out of his eyes before turning to All Might. When he met this Midorishi Izuku\u2019s eyes, he knew that something was off. Not necessarily <em>wrong</em>, but different. There was recognition in this one\u2019s eyes, yet it not the kind that he was used to. There was no malice or contentment or anger. Just confusion.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the newcomer turned around, eyes taking in the scene around him. He stopped on Gran Torino for only a second before looking at all the buildings and the fire and the smoke. If anything, he almost seemed even more confused. When his eyes landed on All for One, he seemed to stop breathing. He didn\u2019t notice his very own counterpart at All for One\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAll for One,\u201d the new Midorishi Izuku breathed out. There was something about his tone and the way he said it. It wasn\u2019t friendly. It almost sounded alarmed. Like he was seeing a long-dead ghost.</p>\n<p>If All for One still had a mouth, he would be grinning. \u201cWelcome, Midorishi Izuku. I\u2019m sure you have questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is <em>Midoriya</em>,\u201d the new Midorishi Izuku\u2014no, Midoriya\u2014 said slowly, like he couldn\u2019t quite believe he had to say that out loud. The alarm All Might previously saw on his face was gone, replaced by a steel gaze. His voice was tight. All Might, for the life of him, could not figure out why. \u201cAnd I think that might be a bit up an understatement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can explain, my child,\u201d All Might did not miss the flinch from Midoriya Izuku when All for One spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re from a parallel world. I brought you here with a quirk of mine, I\u2019m sure you know. My precious Izuku here would like some help and I thought it was only fitting for a man like himself to help\u2026.himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re here and you can help me kick All Might\u2019s fucking ass,\u201d Midorishi\u2014the one that All Might had fought over and over and over\u2014said in a crude sort of way.</p>\n<p>Midoriya glanced at his counterpart currently standing by All for One\u2019s side as if noticing him for the first time. Midorishi bared his teeth in a grin while Midoriya edged backwards a little. All for One\u2019s words did nothing to calm him as he glanced at the buildings all around (burning, still burning. All Might can only hope the heroes got all the civilians out in time). Midoriya caught All Might\u2019s eyes, almost as if he were asking a silent question, before turning his attention back to All for One.</p>\n<p>He seemed more confused than All Might himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Kamino,\u201d Midoriya said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d All for One agreed. \u201cThis will be the final resting place of All Might.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Midoriya Izuku said and paused, thinking over the words. He sounded taken aback. \u201cYou want <em>me </em>to help fight All Might.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cOf course,\u201d All for One nodded along. \u201cI can offer you double of whatever my counterpart is paying you currently, along with anything your little heart could desire. Of course, you would get to help out drastically\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you happen to <em>check</em> what world you were pulling me out of when you did this?\u201d Midoriya Izuku interrupted and it was said in such an incredulous tone that had the situation not been as critical as it was, All Might would have laughed.</p>\n<p>All for One waved him off. \u201cName your price after this, then. We\u2019ll speak of it more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something nudged his side. All Might looked down to see Gran Torino, who gestured to the three locked in a conversation. Half of his mask was burned off and he was covered in cuts, but overall he still was able to fight. All Might was thankful for that, at least, because at the rate this was going All Might was going to have to be fighting <em>two</em> Midorishi or Midoriya (or <em>whatever they\u2019re called\u2014)</em> <em>and</em> All for One.</p>\n<p><em>Attack?</em> Gran Torino mouthed. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet, All Might did not.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what was keeping him there, rooted to the spot. It might have been because his legs were so exhausted that if he took but a single step, he would collapse. Perhaps it was the fact that he could barely see straight, much less throw a punch in his current state. Perhaps, just perhaps, it was because something inside of him\u2014One for All\u2014seemed to be telling him to <em>wait just a little longer. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait\u2014</em></p>\n<p>Heroes were starting to gather again. All Might could see them on the tops of the rubble, slowly coming forward. The jumped from rock to rock as carefully as they could. Police held their guns and barricades high as they slowly marched forward. All Might was able to spot Naomasa in the crowd, decked out in full protection gear.</p>\n<p>All for One noticed them too and turned to Midoriya Izuku. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku paused and then raised his head. There was a fire in there that All Might had never seen from Midorishi before. Power flared to life and Midoriya seemed to <em>glow</em> as streaks of green lighting littered his body. Fire leaked from his glowing eyes. The power that he put out was so strong that he cracked the very ground that he stood on.</p>\n<p>All Might<em> knew</em> that power.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m like in this world,\u201d Midoriya met the gaze of his counterpart. \u201cIt seems like I\u2019m pretty shitty, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy child\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Midoriya Izuku!\u201d Midoriya shouted at the pair. His voice rang over the rubble of Kamino and all of the heroes paused to listen. All for One and Midorishi reeled back in surprise as the new Midoriya took a step forward. His expression burned in anger, the likes of which All Might had never seen. It wasn\u2019t directed at him\u2014no, it was directed only at the villains. \u201cI am Deku, the successor of All Might and the current keeper of peace!\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might sucked in a surprised breath of air. That was not the declaration he had expected, yet he knew as he looked at this man he could be nothing else. The power that was around him\u2014One for All\u2014his costume, his posture. From the moment he arrived here, All Might knew he had been different.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku was a <em>hero</em>.</p>\n<p>Midorishi\u2019s expression slowly changed into horror; the very horror that All Might had felt just minutes before. The type of horror that was felt when a costly mistake had been made. One that would not be so easily fixed. Midorishi glanced up at All for One who only sat there, stock still.</p>\n<p>All Might wished that he hadn\u2019t destroyed All for One\u2019s face because he would\u2019ve <em>loved </em>to see the expression he was making right now.</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2014no, <em>Deku</em> raised his fist with a snarl. \u201cAll for One, you\u2019ve been my enemy since the day I was born.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deku let his punch fly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dust settled and the storm rolled back for now.</p>\n<p>The battle had been short. The moment that All for One recognized the power that Deku wielded, he warped Midorishi away despite the numerous protests sent his way. All for One stepped forward, seemingly ready to take on Deku himself. His hundreds of stolen quirks pumped through his veins and his arm inflated like a terrifying balloon.</p>\n<p>That was when All Might stepped to Deku\u2019s aid.</p>\n<p>All for One was not a stupid man. He knew when he was overpowered and outclassed. With the hoard of heroes and police steadily getting closer, he knew he was running on borrowed time. Perhaps in another world, All for One could take on All Might himself, but having two users of One for All was too much, even for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2026not even I could foresee this outcome,\u201d All for One rumbled. It almost sounded like a laugh. \u201cTo think that my own prodigy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not <em>anything</em> of yours,\u201d Deku told him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might lunged at All for One, putting all his remaining power into the attack. He felt as the embers of One for All burst to live in a great explosion with the last shred of the fire he had tried to desperately to keep lit. He let his fist fly, feeling as the power flew down his arm all the way to the tips of his fingers.</p>\n<p>A great explosion rocked the city as his compressed air smashed into the rubble before him. There were shouts from behind him as the heroes worked to find their footing. Dust was kicked up into the air, covering the area in a thick smoke. It made it nearly impossible to see anything.</p>\n<p>All Might didn\u2019t need to see in order to know that All for One was already long gone. \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>And,</em> All Might thought as he looks down at this hands. <em>One for All might be as well.</em></p>\n<p>The green light to his left side fades and All Might turned to look at his surprising ally. Deku looked up at him, meeting his gaze. There was worry and confusion in his oh so familiar eyes, yet, All Might had never seen anything as different. As All Might stared at this man, familiar yet unfamiliar, he couldn\u2019t help but think of those whispered words.</p>\n<p>\n<em>You\u2019re next.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Naomasa Tsukauchi had seen a lot of things in his successful career as a detective and a close friend of All Might\u2019s, but this situation was beyond even him.</p>\n<p>He had seen the last of the battle. To most, the powerful blast was a simple strength enhancement quirk, but he knew better. He\u2019d been friends with All Might a very, very long time and known <em>about</em> him for even longer. He\u2019d seen that quirk before. He knew what it was.</p>\n<p>A strength enhancement quirk would have been easier.</p>\n<p>Police were already on the scene, guns pointed at the newcomer. The man\u2014Midoriya\u2014barley even blinked. He simply raised his hands in surrender.</p>\n<p>Yagi Toshinori was surrounded by people, in his true form, obviously uncomfortable. Now that one of his biggest secrets had been revealed\u2026Naomasa felt for his friend. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy for any of them. He walked forward just as the emergency services finished bandaging his arm. He paused almost ten feet away, waiting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go to the hospital to get this treated, Mr. All Might,\u201d the EMS personnel was saying.</p>\n<p>Yagi caught Naomasa\u2019s gaze and stood up, despite the protests of EMS. He gave her a smile. \u201cI will, just one second please.\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take All Might long to convince EMS to let him go (\u201cNo, I promise I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sure the detective just wants to talk\u2014\u201d). Naomasa watched him approach. Yagi gave him a tired smile that Naomasa didn\u2019t hesitate to return. Thin lipped and not all there, but a smile nonetheless. His friend looked much other than he should have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYagi-san,\u201d Naomasa sighed and looked around at the rubble that was once Kamino. He thought back to the last bit of the fight, of the green lightning. Of the sheer power that he saw displayed in the hands of someone that everyone thought was an enemy. \u201cThat was One for All, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yagi Toshinori breathed. \u201cIt was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a complicated situation indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yagi didn\u2019t say anything in reply, opting to slowly sit down on the bits of debris that covered the ground. Naomasa helped him settle himself as they watched the heroes and police alike bustle around the field. Police sirens wailed and in the distance Naomasa heard the distinct sound of a helicopter\u2019s blades heading closer.</p>\n<p>Yagi was staring at the wall of police in the middle. \u201cHe\u2019s not our enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t resisted yet,\u201d Naomasa sighed and followed his gaze. Midoriya Izuku was being shoved into a police car, his entire body bound him an array of cuffs and binds. \u201cIt\u2019s all just a precaution. We can\u2019t rule out that this is one of All for One\u2019s tricks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Yagi said. Naomasa already knew he was right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko had been through a lot of things in his life.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t start out great, according to Gran. He didn\u2019t remember much of his life <em>before</em>, so he supposed it didn\u2019t really matter. All he knew is that his family was dead and All Might found him when he was four years old.</p>\n<p>He got a lot of pitying looks, but it was fine, really. You can\u2019t mourn for someone you didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had a lot of ups and downs. Being raised by Gran was always interesting. All Might would sometimes come visit on the weekends or crash during the week in between his hero shifts. He knew a lot of things he probably shouldn\u2019t, but that was alright because Tenko was always good at keeping his mouth shut. It was an interesting way to be raised, for sure, and he had his fair share of teasing, but he wouldn\u2019t have traded it for the world. Everything was going perfect.</p>\n<p>Until Mirio showed up.</p>\n<p>Tenko wanted to hate him, at first. He was twelve when Mirio first started intergrading himself into their life. All Might started spending more time with Mirio, a first-year at UA at the time, than he would spend with Tenko. Mirio talked fast, liked to eat ramen and would sometimes accidentally phase himself (and loose his clothes in the process) through the table. He liked to laugh, had funny hand gestures and made friends easily. He didn\u2019t like bullies and was always there to lend a helping hand. Mirio declared Friday nights to be movie nights, cuddled up in their home and never really left.</p>\n<p>Mirio was a hard person to hate. Tenko knew why All Might passed One for All to him.</p>\n<p>Tenko thought that All Might couldn\u2019t have possibly made a better choice.</p>\n<p>Secretly, Tenko thought it was good for All Might, too. The stress lines slowly disappeared from his face and he started eating more. He got out of the house besides during his hero sifts. In his true form, he would smile more often. He opened up to Gran when he had problems. When Tenko got accepted into U.A\u2019s hero course, they celebrated. All Might started to bring Tenko things\u2014a white cape, yellow gloves, a red and gold belt. For the longest time, Tenko never knew why.</p>\n<p>Then he learned about Nana Shimura.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His grandmother, apparently. Tenko didn\u2019t even know his own mother, much less his grandmother. Gran and All Might never seemed to want to talk about her. They only told him that he had her smile and that she was a great hero.</p>\n<p>Tenko, personally, thought All Might was better.</p>\n<p>Which was why he was worried when the livestream went out. Tenko was no stranger to All for One. He clearly remembered All Might\u2019s battle just five years earlier. That had been scary, too.</p>\n<p>Huddled on the bench of the nearest police station, Tenko looked up at Mirio. \u201cAll Might\u2026 he\u2019s going to be okay, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio gave him as big of a smile as he could and a thumbs up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him, he\u2019s strong!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut still\u2026.\u201d Tenko said as he looked at the blank computer screen. He\u2019s tired and hungry but he needed something\u2014anything\u2014to know that All Might and Gran were okay. The officers bustled around the station, conveniently ignoring the two. Tenko could distantly hear Bakugo yelling in one of the locked rooms. Kirishima and Yaomomo were also somewhere around, but he couldn\u2019t quite see them. \u201cAll for One is strong too. And the livestream\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve in him, Tenko,\u201d Mirio interrupted then raised an eyebrow with an amused expression. Mirio had been through even more than Tenko had at this point, being a third year at UA and interning under Sir. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got yourself to worry about! That stunt you pulled was really rash!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko bit his lip and looked down. It was really, <em>really </em>stupid when they followed the tracker put on the Nomu. However\u2026</p>\n<p>Bakugo\u2014his classmate\u2014had been kidnapped. Standing there and watching wasn\u2019t an option.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was probably going to get in more trouble for that entire rescuing stunt but right now he couldn\u2019t care about anything. His feet ached and his bones hurt. His favorite shirt had torn and he was fighting to keep himself awake. He doubted he could stand at this point.</p>\n<p>He never once regretted his actions. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima asked for my help,\u201d Tenko looked Mirio in the eye. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio burst out laughing and slapped his back so hard he went tumbling. He got up, rubbing his back and sent Mirio a sour look. Mirio either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the heart of a hero! I\u2019ve always liked that about you! It was still reckless!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio\u2019s laughter calmed down. Tenko felt a weight on his shoulder and looked up to see Mirio looking at him with a small smile. \u201cJust\u2026ask me next time, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko stared at him, wide eyed. He couldn\u2019t find his voice. Mirio was the best person in the world and nothing anyone said could ever change his mind. \u201cAlright. Uh, thanks, Mirio.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Mirio\u2019s expression smoothed out. \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019ll wake you up if either of them call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHeard you got your ass kicked by your counterpart,\u201d was the first thing Midorishi heard when he walked into their new hideout (<em>stupid</em> heroes their <em>stupid</em> raid). He sent a venomous glare at Dabi who simply smirked and crossed his arms in return. \u201cWasn\u2019t he supposed to be on our side?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut <em>up</em>,\u201d Midorishi snarled at him because he was sore and tired and he was <em>not</em> about to put up with Dabi\u2019s bullshit. It was Dabi\u2019s fault they lost that UA kid\u2014Bakugo or whatever the fuck they called him.</p>\n<p>Toga Himiko bounded up to him, a bloody knife in one hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like? Huh? <em>Huh!?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorishi bared his teeth in a snarl and pushed her out of his space. She was more annoying than a fly but good at her job. The personal space thing needed to be worked on, though. The rest of Vanguard Action Squad wandered around their new space, still reeling from their defeat.</p>\n<p>The bar that constituted as their new hideout was gross. The beams were cracking, there was mold on the left wall and all the barstools looked like they had been crushed with a Nomu. It was definitely worse than their last one but Kurogiri picked it out and Kurogiri had always been stingy about his bars. Midorishi didn\u2019t understand it. Didn\u2019t particularly care.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking annoying,\u201d Midorishi snapped, ignoring Kurogiri\u2019s warning look. He didn\u2019t need his stupid caretaker anyways. \u201cA hero! A fucking hero! Of <em>all things</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, I bet he\u2019s cute,\u201d Toga said like she didn\u2019t have the fattest fucking target painted on her forehead. Midorishi glared daggers at her. \u201cYou should smile more, Midori.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just as Midorishi was about to lunge at her (<em>I\u2019ll show you a smile, you bitc</em>\u2014), Sensei appeared.</p>\n<p>Midorishi skidded to a halt not two feet in front of him.</p>\n<p>He had known Sensei all his life. Sensei was the one to save him, to pick him up off the streets and call him <em>useful</em>.\u00a0 Midorishi, who had been called useless all his life, felt like he could finally breathe again. Being quirkless wasn\u2019t easy, even for a villain, but Sensei changed that. Through his kindness and his wisdom, he became bigger. Better. He tore down all those that abandoned him and burned those that tried to hurt him.</p>\n<p>Suddenly he was so much <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So</em>,\u201d Dabi drawled because, really, it was <em>always</em> Dabi. He couldn\u2019t ever seem to shut his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re the big, evil dude behind all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sensei doesn\u2019t even glance in his direction. \u201cCalm down, my child. This was not a loss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorishi felt shame burn inside him. They were close, so close, but they messed up. <em>He</em> messed up. \u201cHe\u2019s with the heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sensei agreed. \u201cBut as much as he is different, he is you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s not,</em> Midorishi wanted to say, but didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Instead he bit his lip, not understanding Sensei\u2019s point. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much chaos do you think that will bring?\u201d Sensei playfully tipped his head to the side, sounding amused. If he still had a face, he would be smiling. \u201cFor a hero to come to a villains\u2019 world\u2026 I doubt this will be easy for Midoriya Izuku either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Naomasa was tired.</p>\n<p>With the destruction of Kamino, All Might\u2019s retirement and Midoriya Izuku (if that even was his name) in custody, there was a lot on his plate. The civilians were already panicking. The loss of lives were staggering. The police force was spread thin, desperately trying to keep the masses calm. It\u2019s only been a day since then, but Naomasa knew that the chaos was only going to get worse.</p>\n<p>He would have never thought a parallel world was possible. If you asked him a mere forty eight hours ago that they were connected to another world via quirk, he would have laughed, but quirks are strange things with even stranger powers. He watched the man so similar to the one that he had been hunting for months and found that there wasn\u2019t much else he could believe. He saw what happened, he heard what was being said. Both All Might and Gran Torino agreed that this was not Midorishi Izuku.</p>\n<p>Naomasa could only stare at Midoriya Izuku through the double-screened glass of the interrogation room.</p>\n<p>He was different than Midorishi. His eyes were a brighter green, his hair a bit shorter. There was a distinct lack of scar that ran down the left side of his face, but it would have been impossible not to notice all the jagged scars that littered his arms. A particularly nasty one ran from his elbow to the tips of his fingers. He was calm, not once raising his voice. He smiled at the police despite their rough handling and, most importantly, didn\u2019t make a single hostile move.</p>\n<p>If anything, Naomasa appreciated that.</p>\n<p>The police just finished fastening his arms and legs to the table. Four metals chains on each hand, three on each leg and a band wrapped around his chest to keep him tied to the chair. It would be impossible to move anything besides his head. For most people, the cuffs alone would be strong enough to keep him from moving or using his quirk.</p>\n<p>Unless his power was what he thought it was. Unless All Might was right.</p>\n<p>Hopefully those cuffs wouldn\u2019t be needed.</p>\n<p>A knock sounded on the door. There was a crack as the door opened, echoing around the silent room. Naomasa didn\u2019t even turn his head. One of the outside police officers peeked in and said \u201che\u2019s ready for you,\u201d as if he hadn\u2019t been watching this entire time.</p>\n<p>Naomasa steeled his nerves, activated his quirk and walked through the door to the interrogation room.</p>\n<p>\u201cNaomasa-san,\u201d Midoriya Izuku said immediately upon him entering and offered a smile. Naomasa paused at the familiar way his name was said, momentarily taken aback. He pursed his lips. Midoriya seemed to take the hint, his face heating up. \u201cS-sorry! That was inconsiderate. Would you prefer to be called Tsukauchi?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s not our enemy</em>, All Might had said. Naomasa couldn\u2019t help but think back to when Midoriya had been striped on his belongings in which they found only his phone, certified support items in his belt and a <em>valid hero license</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor now, yes.\u201d Naomasa placed his case folder on the table and gracefully slid into his chair. Midoriya Izuku was watching his every move. It was strange, seeing this man. The man with the same face as a villain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this took so long to set up. We\u2019ll get down to business. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never on this side of the table,\u201d Midoriya said and smiled nervously.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku is\u2026different. Not just physically.</p>\n<p>Naomasa opened his folder. \u201cName?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t detect a lie but even so\u2026 \u201cNot Midorishi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Midoriya said, coming out more as a question than as a statement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting. Age?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-two.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ah\u2026 here comes the fun part</em>, Naomasa thought. \u201cQuirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya paused and relaxed in his seat. When Naomasa met his eyes, he could see <em>something </em>there. The tired understand of a man who knew too much. Who had seen too much. Midoriya gave him a thin smile. \u201cTsukauchi-san, you of all people know I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a direct confession, not really, but even so Naomasa thought that it was probably better that way. There were very few people on this planet that knew about the history of One for All and even fewer who knew the name. It would not have been a smart move to say anything in a crowded police station where he was the number one subject of interest.</p>\n<p>Naomasa felt like laughing. He almost felt in over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI plan for a lot of things ,\u201d Naomasa told Midoriya and leaned back in his chair. Today was supposed to be easier than yesterday. \u201cBut this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, I didn\u2019t quite plan for this either. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s something you\u00a0<em>can\u00a0</em>plan for.\u201d Midoriya was smiling again, but it was tired. \u201cI have a question for you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Normally he would say not but\u2026this wasn\u2019t a normal interrogation anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>That was the million dollar question, wasn\u2019t it? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy or how?\u201d Naomasa said instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth, if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Naomasa placed a hand on the folder. It was thin, much too thin to really be a case. Too little information, too many questions. He wished he had the answers to give Midoriya. Wished he had the answers to his own questions. \u201cI was hoping\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>could tell <em>me\u00a0</em>that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll for One\u2026\u201d Midoriya said and paused. He just sounded confused. \u201cAll for One wanted me to help fight All Might. He said he brought me over specifically. He implied that I was working under the All for One of my world.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Why was my counterpart right there next to him?\u00a0</em>Midoriya seemed to be saying.</p>\n<p>If he truly was a hero in his world, this was probably confusing. To Naomasa, who had been on Midorishi\u2019s case since the day he attacked USJ, things made a little more sense. All for One wouldn\u2019t have known that the Midorishi of a parallel world was a hero. It was just a theory\u2014a working theory. If he asked All Might, his friend would probably deny it. All for One was not one to make costly mistakes but Naomasa could think of no other reason to summon a <em>hero\u00a0</em>to a <em>villain\u2019s\u00a0</em>world.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you <em>are</em> a villain in this world,\u201d Naomasa said, instead, because that\u2019s about as much detail as he can give him at this point.</p>\n<p>Midoriya bit his lip, but didn\u2019t seem all too surprised. It was like he was expecting it, having put those pieces together already. There was something in his eyes\u2014something akin to regret and maybe even a bit of horror. A thousand questions asked and a thousand more unanswered.</p>\n<p>\u201cH-how,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cHow many people have I hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em></p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s not our enemy</em>, All Might\u2019s voice repeated in his mind like a mantra. He didn\u2019t show it on his face. He\u2019s not our enemy, <em>he\u2019s not our enemy, not our enemy, not our enemy</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, specifically?\u201d Naomasa said and tried to keep his voice even. \u201cNone that we know of. Your counterpart, however, has a body count about as high as you could imagine.\u201d</p>\n<p>It probably wasn\u2019t the best thing to say, but it was nothing but the truth. Naomasa had promised to always give the truth. Midorishi Izuku was a villain. A villain who had pillaged, destroyed and murdered thousands of lives.</p>\n<p>Midoriya fell silent and stared at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Naomasa said instead because he still had questions that needed answers if they were going to figure this case out. Midoriya seemed to have his eyes glued to the cuffs on his wrists. \u201cCan you tell me what has happened in the twenty four hours leading up to the incident?\u201d</p>\n<p>That snapped Midoriya out of it enough for him to stop and think about it. \u201cIt was supposed to be my day off. I was going to meet up with Todoroki Shouto for our weekly caf\u00e9 run. I woke up, got ready. Ended up involved in a villain attack around noon anyways. I was late and Shouto came looking for me. I saw him on the street, about a hundred yards away from the caf\u00e9. I started walking over to him and suddenly I was in Kamino again, watching it be destroyed a second time.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>No lie. The bit about knowing Endeavor\u2019s kid was interesting, especially seeing how close they seem, however\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cA second time,\u201d Naomasa said. \u201cAs in, this has happened before?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was fifteen. My first year of UA.\u201d Midoriya slowly nodded. Naomasa filed the UA information away. He might end up having to make a call later. \u201cWe were at a summer camp. Villains attacked us. Shigaraki Tomura and the League took Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d Naomasa asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo Katsuki,\u201d Midoriya answered. That was intriguing. It was impossible to forget the UA student who took the Sports Festival by storm not even a few months back. It was even harder to forget the boy who had, as of yesterday, been rescued after being kidnapped. It would've been impossible to not remember that name. That other one, however\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cShigaraki Tomura,\u201d Naomasa paused to think it over. Shigaraki was something that, in all of his time as a detective, he\u2019s never once heard. That\u2019s not always a good thing. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t. If All for One didn\u2019t take him in, he\u2019s probably long dead at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Naomasa said. He\u2019ll have to look into that later. \u201cContinue, please. I\u2019m sorry for my interruption.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya continued to explain how he and a few of his classmates (using names that Naomasa recognized from UA\u2019s Class 1-A) went to rescue Bakugo. They used a tracker that Yaoyorozu Momo had put on the back of a Nomu and disguised themselves. From there, they found a Nomu factory. That\u2019s when the heroes attacked, All for One showed up, followed by Bakugo and the League of villains and, finally, All Might. Midoriya explained how they used their quirks to launch themselves over the battle field to rescue Kacchan so All Might could fight freely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t there to fight,\u201d Midoriya quickly said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t technically illegal because we didn\u2019t use your quirks to\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend yourself to me,\u201d Naomasa said, amused. The same thing happened here, after all, just with a couple of different people.</p>\n<p>\u201cR-right. Anyways, after Kamino and All Might\u2019s subsequent retirement, we moved into the dorms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould I be correct to assume that you were also attacked at USJ your first year?\u201d Naomasa asked because if he was correct then, well, things were just slowly getting more and more complicated.</p>\n<p>\u201cW\u2014oh,\u201d Midoriya looked confused still. \u201cYes, you would be correct to assume that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku had yet to utter a single lie.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it would have been easier if he were lying the entire time.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parallel world,\u201d Naomasa said. This was <em>much </em>more confusing that he originally thought. \u201cYet you seem to be ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya sighed and slumped as much as he could in his restraints. \u201cI was afraid you would say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe parallel world or the issue about time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya continued to tell him his side of the story, obviously leaving out a few important details that Naomasa picked up on. For now, he let it slide. He didn\u2019t want to secret of One for All the be heard here anyways. He had calls to make if he wanted a full story, without any unwanted ears listening in. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It took another hour of discussion for Naomasa to finally be satisfied enough the wrap up the interrogation (although it was much more similar to a discussion). He packed up his file, voice recorder and notes before heading to the door, thanking Midoriya in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cNaomasa-san,\u201d Midoriya called right just as Naomasa put a hand on the doorknob. He stopped and turned to face Midoriya. Midoriya\u2019s eyes burned with such fierce determination, the kind that Naomasa had only seen reflected in those of All Might. \u201cI know I might be a villain in this world, but I am a hero in mine. I will do whatever it takes to help as many people as I can. If that means staying here until I defeat myself, then that is what I will do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Naomasa had a lot to think about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>All Might</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yesterday, 5:56pm</p>\n<p>good luck with the raid!!!! sir has me on standby.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, 9:36pm</p>\n<p>all might, tenko was apparently involved!!!!! im going to pick him up from the police station.</p>\n<p>all might?</p>\n<p>Yesterday, 11:25pm</p>\n<p>all might, im watching the livestream. tenko is here with me. please be okay.</p>\n<p>Today, 8:23am</p>\n<p>all might please tell me you\u2019re okay. tenko &amp; i are worried.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Today 3:34 pm</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Mirio. Meet me at Yokohama Police Station. We have some things to talk about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku was having a hell of a day.</p>\n<p>It was supposed to be his day off. Every Monday, he and Shouto have gone out to lunch together since the day they graduated. To anyone who asked, it was just two good friends catching up about their lives. To them, it was more of a small celebration each week for being alive. The fact that they were there. They were there and alive and still standing even after everything. A <em>congrats on not dying! </em>kind of deal.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d already been running late\u2014Shouto had texted him stating as such. He\u2019d been hurrying down the streets, passing through the crowds with practice ease. He was only about a block away from the caf\u00e9 when the convince store exploded right next to him. So, he was going to be even more late. Really, it wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014being a hero demanded that you were always on your toes, always ready to help even when it was supposed to be your day off\u2014so when he saw the panicked civilians needing <em>someone</em>, he stepped in. He wrapped up that battle as fast as it had begun.</p>\n<p>Shouto, who must have heard the noise and had come running out, had just enough time to watch as Izuku tied the villains\u2019 hands and walk over to him before, well, nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One moment he was in Musutafu about to get coffee and the next he was in Kamino with a long-dead ghost trying to get him to fight All Might.</p>\n<p><em>You attract trouble even when you\u2019re doing nothing,\u00a0</em>Tenya once said.</p>\n<p><em>I don\u2019t,\u00a0</em>Izuku had protested.</p>\n<p>He totally did. He owed an apology to Tenya after this mess sorted itself out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might?\u201d Naomasa \u00a0called from behind him. All Might startled, turning around. His old friend gave him a smile from where he had his head poked through one of the office doors. \u201cA word, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might pursed his lips, but followed. He hasn\u2019t heard much about the situation seeing as he was in the hospital for the last twenty-four hours (not that he was too injured\u2014if the, ah, interruption hadn\u2019t happened he\u2019d be <em>much </em>worse off). By the time he\u2019d been discharged to the time that he\u2019d arrived at the police station, all he heard from Naomasa was the fact that Mirio might want to be here. That was it. Naomasa gave no information on All for One or Midorishi or Midoriya.</p>\n<p><em>Ah, well, that was probably going to change here soon,</em>All Might thought as he entered the small office area.</p>\n<p>The room was much more spacious than it appeared on the outside. There were cabinets lining the walls and a round, wooden table in the center of the room. Three people were already there; Aizawa, Nedzu and Midoriya (who was suspiciously lacking the cuffs that All Might had last seen him in). Midoriya offered a nervous smile, Nedzu waved and Aizawa did no more than glance at him before going back to his phone.</p>\n<p>It was a strange group of people, especially seeing how calm everyone seemed to be. In truth, a group like this should never have been able to coexist peacefully, yet here they all were in a crowded police station after one of the greatest tragedies on the last ten or so years.</p>\n<p>Midoriya, he could understand. After all, this entire situation revolved around him. However, it was truly unnerving to see Midoriya smile like that. All Might knew the sadistic grins and bitter smiles but never had he seen the boy with such a kind expression. He knew Midoriya and Midorishi were different, but seeing it for the first time <em>was </em>rather unsettling.</p>\n<p>Aizawa and Nedzu, however, were a mystery to All Might. UA and its teachers were not often involved in matters like this unless it directly involved one of their students. So seeing Class 1-A\u2019s homeroom teacher and the principal crowded around the small, wooden table threw him for a loop.</p>\n<p>Naomasa saw his confusion. \u201cThey\u2019re important, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImportant to <em>what</em>, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya is from another world\u2014a parallel world.\u201d Naomasa explained. Nedzu watched him with rapt attention but didn\u2019t appear to be surprised. The same could not be said for All Might, who startled, because even though All for One had said the same thing, that\u2014that was\u2026</p>\n<p>Naomasa shot him a look before he could interrupt. All Might shut his mouth and let his old friend continue. \u201cIn his time, he\u2019s already faced All for One. We believe that he might have information that will be useful to us in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2026made sense. More than anything else, really. This Midoriya wasn\u2019t like his counterpart. He was older, calmer and not as, ah, <em>intense</em>. He didn\u2019t share his counterpart\u2019s ideals. He wasn\u2019t a villain. He announced as such back on the battle field, only a day ago.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am Deku, the successor of All Might and the current keeper of peace!</em>\n</p>\n<p>That reminded him\u2026\u201cAre you really the current Symbol of Peace?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked at him in the same way that Mirio or Tenko did. All Might was never quite sure what way that was. \u201cI am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Naomasa sat across from Midoriya and next to Aizawa. He guested at the empty seat next to him. All Might took the hint and sat down. Naomasa nodded towards Midoriya. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start from the beginning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya slowly nodded, placing his hands on the table. He looked lost in thought. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I wanted to be a hero. The type of hero that was kind and dependable. A\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA smiling, dependable, cool hero,\u201d All Might said under his breath. He knew those words, whispered in the heat of battle. He didn\u2019t know how or why but <em>he knew those words</em>.</p>\n<p>He <em>also </em>didn\u2019t really expect anyone to hear it but Midoiyra was looking at him with surprise. Aizawa glanced at him from the corner of his eye and shared a look with Nedzu. Naomasa was giving him that <em>look</em>; the look that said they were going to talk later. Ah, well, that was never good.</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon my interruption,\u201d All Might said, instead, because the last thing he wanted to do was make it worse.</p>\n<p>Midoriya stared at him quietly for a little longer before turning back to Naomasa. He bit his lip, visibly hesitating, all the while glancing at Aizawa and Nedzu. \"I\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone in this room knows about One for All,\u201d Naomasa interrupted. \u201cOr, in the case of Aizawa, was briefed about it before entering.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya breathed a sigh of relief. He looked at Nedzu who only smiled at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Nedzu knew about One for All.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s known since the start,\u201d Naomasa said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Midoriya smiled and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cI guess I should have figured that but Nedzu is sort of terrifying. And by <em>sort of</em>, I mean <em>very</em>. Uh, I\u2019m sorry, that was rude! I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright,\u201d Nedzu said happily. He\u2019s \u00a0still smiling, like he always did, but there\u2019s an edge to it. \u201cI like think of that as a compliment.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door slammed open and shut with equal force. No one in the room startled, but everyone turned to look. Mirio stood in the doorway, smile on his face. Seeing their looks, he waved enthusiastically to them all. Nedzu and Naomasa were the only two who waved back. Mirio rushed to the empty seat and sat down next to All Might. \u201c<em>Heey</em>! I\u2019m here! Sorry I\u2019m late! Had to be briefed and all before I could come barding in here, I guess. <em>Whoooaa</em>, you really do look like Midorishi!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMirio-senpai?\u201d Midoriya said. He seemed startled. Then, under his breath, he started to mutter, \u201cWhy would Mirio-senpai be here? He would be a third year at this time going off the ages that Nao\u2014I mean, Tsukauchi-san gave me. He would be interning with Sir at this point. As far as I remember, Sir wasn\u2019t involved in Kamino at all so why would he be here? Unless\u2026but that wouldn\u2019t make sense because he doesn\u2019t know\u2014<em>ohhhhhhhh</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might watched on, stunned, as the boy seemed to work out his own problems through barley understandable mutterings. Nedzu tilted his head curiously while Aizawa just seemed bored. Mirio\u2019s cheerful expression never visibly changed, but All Might could tell that he was tense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Naomasa just smiled. \u201cCare to explain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya blushed up to his roots. \u201cSir always wanted Mirio to be the ninth. I just pieced that together, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I know that Mirio has One for All</em><em>in this world,</em>was what he tried to say.</p>\n<p>Naomasa came to the same conclusion. He offered another smile. \u201cSince Mirio is here, why don\u2019t we restart? This time, with One for All.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Uh, I already said I wanted to be a hero since I was little,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t say was that I was born quirkless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, All Might knew where this was going. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a world where only twenty percent of the human population doesn\u2019t have a quirk, it was hard. I took a lot of criticism but I never doubted myself. I just had to work harder than anyone else,\u201d Midoriya took a deep breath. \u201cWhen I was fourteen, I met All Might. He saved me from a villain. I, uh, may or may not of hitched a ride on his pant leg. I asked him if someone like me, quirkless, could become a hero. He said no. That was the first and last time that I considered that maybe I wasn\u2019t cut out to be a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya was staring at All Might again and he tried not to sweat. In reality, he probably would have said the same thing to a quirkless child however, Midoriya wasn\u2019t just a quirkless child. His counterpart must have seen <em>something </em>in him to pass on One for All.</p>\n<p>All Might just wished he could see that as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cLong story short, I rushed in to save a friend. All Might was impressed and offered me his quirk. I accepted. For the next ten months until the UA entrance exam, he trained me at Dagobah Beach in order to prepare my body to receive One for All.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya went on to explain about the entrance exam; how he got zero villain points, how he destroyed the zero pointer and got in on rescue points alone. Aizawa and Nedzu both looked minorly impressed. Midoriya explained how it had physical repercussions on his body (although he didn\u2019t explain what those physical repercussions <em>were</em>, All Might had a good idea) and for the next few years, how he struggled to control his power. He mentioned the attack on USJ and how that was the first time he met Shigaraki Tomura, All for One\u2019s successor in his world. The Sports Festival, meeting Gran Torino, what happened in Hosu with the Hero Killer, the attack on the summer camp, all the way up to Kamino.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were put in the dorms after that,\u201d Midoriya said. Then he spoke about the internship he took on with Sir Nighteye and the events leading up to the battle with the Eight Precepts as well as its after effects.</p>\n<p>All Might shared a glance with Mirio while they listened to Midoriya describing the battle. There was\u2026 a lot to think about. A lot that <em>needed </em>to be changed.</p>\n<p>Midoriya explained his second and third year in as equal detail. The situation only seemed to build up and get worse and worse. If this was their future\u2026 All Might had to change it. Too many things would go wrong, too many people would suffer. Midoriya paused when he neared the end of his third year and took a deep breath. \u201cThe July Attacks were our last big battle. Shigaraki and his league attacked. By the time we had any idea what was going on, Japan was under siege. UA was considered one of the last strongholds in Japan. We didn\u2019t have much time left, so we staged a counterattack. We won, but it was a near thing. Afterwards, 3-A graduated with metals of honor for our participation and subsequent end of the war. We easily rose in the rankings, some of us opening up our own agencies right away. By the time I was twenty years old, we dominated the top twenty heroes. I was number five at the time. That was the first time I was officially called the Symbol of Peace. \u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence in the room. Everyone was too deep in thought to offer up any comments. Nedzu leaned back in his chair, took a sip of his tea and sighed. Aizawa was staring intently at a coffee stain on the table. Mirio had long lost his cheerful expression and was instead staring down at his hands. Naomasa\u2019s notes were at least a mile long at this point and he didn\u2019t seem to be stopping any time soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems,\u201d Nedzu said, but his voice is quiet. \u201cThat there is much to think about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI truly am sorry for dumping this all on you. I would like to help, if at all possible,\u201d Midoriya said genuinely. That was what he was\u2014genuine. \u201cTsukauchi-san, I was wondering what was going to happen to my hero license?\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know whether to validate your hero license or not,\u201d Naomasa said. \u201cBecause, technically, you did take the same hero test from the same people, it\u2019s a bit of a\u2026.unique circumstance. For now, it would be better to just avoid conflict and not have to worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya nodded just as Aizawa looked up from his coffee stain. For the first time since he arrived, Aizawa spoke. \u201cThis\u2026 Shigaraki. How likely of a chance that All for One would bring him here, instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZero,\u201d Midoriya responded before All Might even had time to <em>think </em>about the possibility. His voice was strangely flat. He noticed everyone staring at him and he flushed, sinking down into his seat. He wouldn\u2019t meet any of their eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 Shigaraki didn\u2019t survive. During the July Attacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d said Aizawa.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your world?\u201d Midoriya said. All Might easily noticed how quick he was to change the topic. It wasn\u2019t unnoticed by the others in the room. \u201cCan you tell me about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Nedzu said and folded his paws. He was smiling again. \u201cOur worlds are virtually the same except for some unexplainable reason, you and your counterpart switched professions. He is a villain, you are a hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya immediately started to mutter again, twisting his hands in his lap. All Might couldn\u2019t understand a single word he was saying, but Nedzu seemed to be enjoying the entire thing if his widening smile was anything to go by. Mirio laughed a bit under his breath. Midoriya noticed them staring and broke off, waving his hands in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s a bad habit, everyone tells me. I should stop and I\u2019ve been trying but its\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Mirio interrupted him, \u201cI like you better than your counterpart!\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya stopped and stammered out, \u201cUh, thank you? I didn\u2019t think that was hard to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way,\u201d Naomasa said while finishing up writing. He flipped his book shut with an audible\u00a0<em>snap!\u00a0</em>\u201cI think we should figure out where Midoriya here is going to be staying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>pro-hoes</strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[with Iida Tenya, Mezo Shoji, Ashido Mina and 15+ others]</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Wednesday, 2:56 pm</p>\n<p align=\"right\">deku is MIA as of monday afternoon</p>\n<p><strong>jiro:\u00a0</strong>excuse me WHAT</p>\n<p><strong>bakugo:\u00a0</strong>DEKU IS FUCKING W H A T</p>\n<p><strong>tsuyu:</strong>is that why he hasnt been in the news recently? do you know what happened?</p>\n<p><strong>hagakure:\u00a0</strong>oh my god what happened??</p>\n<p><strong>aoyama:\u00a0</strong>tu te fous de ma gueule ?????????????????</p>\n<p><strong>ashido:\u00a0</strong>uraraka are u ok?</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Wednesday, 2:58 pm</p>\n<p align=\"right\">im fine, its todoroki that\u2019s taking the brunt of it</p>\n<p align=\"right\">he just. disappeared. we dont know anything</p>\n<p align=\"right\">we're working on it</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>yeah, if midoriya is anything hes strong</p>\n<p><strong>ojiro:\u00a0</strong>we'll help. he\u2019ll be ok</p>\n<p><strong>yaomomo:\u00a0</strong>We\u2019ll find him, Uraraka.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki Shouto had seen a lot of things in his life. Being a pro-hero definitely helped in that aspect. It wasn\u2019t always a good thing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d seen his friends and classmates injured and beaten so black and blue that they could barely stand. He\u2019d been in more than one hospital waiting room, watching as the staff ran back and forth. There had been times where he wasn\u2019t sure they were going to make it. From his first year at UA to standing here now as number three in the hero rankings, he\u2019d seen his friends in a lot of tough situations.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never seen one disappear right in front of his eyes.</p>\n<p>Only two stores down from the caf\u00e9 they were supposed to meet at on an unsuspecting Monday afternoon, Shouto watched helplessly as his best friend disappeared in a gold and green light.</p>\n<p>Two days of vigorous, nonstop searching yielded absolutely <em>nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, despite his desk being full of pictures, notes, news articles, anything and <em>everything</em>that could possibly help find him\u2014Shouto still had nothing. He tried not to let it get it him, he really did. Izuku was strong. He\u2019d always been strong.</p>\n<p>But he was <em>right there</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>He thought of the smile on Izuku\u2019s face right before he disappeared and failed to get rid of the guilt in his gut.</p>\n<p>Their shared agency\u2014himself, Ochako, Izuku and Tenya\u2014 did its best to cope, with Tenya taking on the brunt of the work, but it was still hard. Kirishima and his agency, being the closest around (and also the ones called during the convince store burglary right before Izuku disappeared), were also informed. Kirishima helped where he could, offering supplies and extra heroes to expand the search. People were asking about Deku and why he had yet to make an appearance. After the July Attacks, Deku had been a constant presence in the hero world. A way of saying, <em>it\u2019s okay because I am here!</em></p>\n<p>When a man like that disappeared, people started to notice.</p>\n<p>Their agency was stuck. They either had to find Izuku and find him <em>soon </em>or release the fact that the <em>Symbol of Peace</em>disappeared and they had <em>no idea where he was</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cTodoroki,\u201d Ochako sighed from her position against his door. Kirishima and Tenya were hovering near her, looking like they wanted to enter his office but couldn\u2019t bring themselves to. They both looked tired an exhausted. Shouto would hate to see what he, himself, looked like. He\u2019d spent just as much time, if not more, on the search. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep beating yourself up over this. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thought of the gold and green light. The smile right before he disappeared. He blinked and Izuku was gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was right there,\u201d Shouto said. \u201cAnd suddenly he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis absolutely wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d \u00a0Tenya said in his no-nonsense voice.</p>\n<p><em>I was there and didn\u2019t do anything</em>, Shouto wanted to say but kept his mouth shut. It didn\u2019t help the guilt tearing at his chest. Izuku had saved him countless times. Izuku always had his back. Yet, he couldn\u2019t save his friend the one time he needed saving.</p>\n<p>That was on Shouto. That was his fault.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing, we need to do it soon,\u201d Kirishima said, drumming his fingers on the doorframe. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worried, man. Villains are taking advantage of his leave. We\u2019re all working overtime just to keep the peace and it just\u2026 It just feels kinda empty without him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku, the boy who showed up the first day of UA and a shaking mess and graduated as the savior of Japan. Countlessly risking life and limb just to offer them\u2014<em>everyone\u00a0</em>in the Class\u2014the safety that they needed. He wedged his way into all of their hearts and never really left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako put a hand on Kirishima\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know. We have to be strong, though. Deku is counting on us. We\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d Tenya said with as much conviction as the situation offered. \u201cI <em>promise\u00a0</em>you we\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midorishi Izuku was in a police station, staring at him.</p>\n<p>When Mirio and All Might had told Tenko they had <em>big news</em>, this was not what he was expecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cShigaraki Tomura,\u201d Midorishi breathed out and looked like he was staring at a ghost. All Might, who had been standing right next to Midorishi <em>and letting him walk around like it was nothing</em>, looked at Midorishi in surprise.</p>\n<p>Tenko has been called a lot of weird things. Teen, Treeko, Tonsil, Tennie Weenie (five year olds were incredibly creative) but that was the first time he\u2019d ever heard someone be so off. That someone being Midorishi\u00a0<em>fucking\u00a0</em>Izuku, the very person who nearly crushed Aizawa-sensei into dust, tried to stab Tsuyu and kidnapped Bakugo not even a week ago. Hell, Tenko had his face <em>smashed into a slab of concrete</em>and had the scar running down his cheekbone to prove it.</p>\n<p>Tenko felt like he should be offended.</p>\n<p>If you try to kill a person, at least learn their names.</p>\n<p>Instead, Tenko steeled his nerves, pointed to his chest and asked, \u201cYou mean me?\u201d while trying not the think about the fact that he\u2019s holding a conversation with All for One\u2019s successor. \u00a0</p>\n<p>All Might was glancing between the two of them before saying, very slowly, \u201cThat\u2019s Shimura Tenko.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShimura Tenko\u2026\u201d Midorishi Izuku paused before letting out a huff of hair. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve <em>got to be kidding me</em>. What did Nedzu say, that they were virtually the same?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your Shigaraki was Tenko,\u201d All Might, if anything, looked troubled. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell Naomasa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought he would be dead,\u201d Midorishi muttered. Normally, that statement would put anyone on edge, but the way Midorishi was looking at him was strange. He almost seemed\u2026wary? Of <em>him</em>?</p>\n<p>\n<em>Seriously, what was going on?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might, uh?\u201d Tenko said and gestured to the number one problem right now. Midorishi Izuku, the leader of the League of Villains, was definitely standing in the lobby of a police station but not in handcuffs. And all the officers seemed to be ignoring him. And All Might wasn\u2019t attacking him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that <em>Midorishi Izuku</em>? Big name villain? The one that, y\u2019know, <em>smashed my face into concrete</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. This is Midoriya Izuku. He\u2019s different. Don\u2019t worry about it, Tenko.\u201d \u00a0All Might said which explained absolutely <em>nothing</em>. If seeing his look, All Might added, \u201cMirio and I will explain at Gran\u2019s place later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko eyed this \u2018Midoriya\u2019, \u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo UA.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Tenko said, trusting his somewhat of a father figure but not Midoriya (Midorishi? Midorishi\u2019s long lost brother?). \u201c<em>Why </em>is he going to UA?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTenko,\u201d All Might warned. Okay, wow, he had a good stern dad face.</p>\n<p>Midoriya smiled at him. Like, actually, <em>truly\u00a0</em>smiled at him. Without trying to smash him into the ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This probably seems weird to you, Shimura.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s different,\u00a0</em>All Might said. Yeah, no fucking kidding. This one <em>smiles</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cTenko,\u201d was the only intelligible thing that came out of his mouth in response.</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name,\u201d Tenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s Tenko.\u201d</p>\n<p>From a young age, he saw the way that his name affected All Might and Gran. The moment someone else called him <em>Shimura</em>, they would both tense and have this far off look in his eyes. Tenko never knew what they were thinking about but he did know who they were thinking <em>of</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko didn\u2019t want to be compared to is his long dead grandmother. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em>certainly\u00a0</em>didn't want the successor (or only look alike?) of his grandmother\u2019s killer calling him that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then, uh, Tenko,\u201d Midoriya was staring at him with that <em>look </em>again. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be seeing you around?\u201d</p>\n<p>It came out as more of a question.</p>\n<p>Tenko shot a look at All Might who only gave him a tired smile in return. \u201cI guess so?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might put a hand on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder and lead him away. Very few even glanced in their direction. Tenko could only stare at their backs in horrified disbelief. That was\u2026..well, weird would be an understatement. Midoriya Izuku was a strange person. The way Midoriya looked at him\u2026he couldn\u2019t quite get Midoriya\u2019s expression out of his mind.</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked at him like he was a villain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying,\u201d Tenko said slowly. \u201cThat Midoriya Izuku is from a parallel world. That he is a hero in his world. That he saves people. That he\u2019s the <em>Symbol of Peace</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words echoed around Gran\u2019s beaten down apartment. Crowded around the small kitchen table was All Might, Mirio and Gran himself (still covered in bandages and only recently discharged but otherwise alright). Mirio and All Might had just finished explaining what when down in the police precinct not four hours ago.</p>\n<p>He <em>may or may not\u00a0</em>be a bit hysterical.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d All Might said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon my French but <em>what the fuck.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Mirio chastised with a grin. Gran laughed. All Might looked like he was seconds away from calling it a night and going to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cA hero,\u201d Tenko repeated. \u201c<em>Him</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like Midorishi,\u201d All Might said and crossed his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe also wields One for All,\u201d Mirio added like that was supposed to make anything better.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em>WHAT?!\u201d </em>Tenko leapt to his feet. All Might tried to get him to sit back down but Tenko\u2019s head was spinning way too fast to even <em>think\u00a0</em>right now. He looked accusingly at Gran. \u201cDid you know about this?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI watched him use it, brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs no one else a little suspicious at All for One <em>happens\u00a0</em>to summon a guy that wields One for All and calls himself a hero?! <em>At all</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gran picked at his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTenko, chill,\u201d Mirio said. Even <em>Mirio</em>, god. \u201cHe\u2019s really not like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko whirled on him. \u201cAnd how long have you known him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTenko,\u201d All Might said. Tenko turned and met his eyes. All Might offered him a small, tired smile. There was something in his eyes. Something that he wasn't saying but it was there all the same. \u201cHe\u2019s not a villain. <em>Trust me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He did trust All Might. He just couldn\u2019t bring himself to trust Midoriya Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>ALL MIGHT vs. THE FACELESS MAN and the LEADER OF THE LEAGUE OF VILLIANS </strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">Posted: Sunday 7:56 pm</p>\n<p align=\"center\">By Azuma Hachiro</p>\n<p>As I\u2019m sure everyone has heard, on Monday evening Kamino Ward, located in the city of Yokohama, was attacked. This was directly following a raid that focused on the League of Villains\u2019 headquarters to rescue kidnapped first year UA student, Bakugo Katsuki. The destruction of Kamino and the subsequent loss of lives are taking its toll on all of Japan. The country is in mourning.</p>\n<p>As of right now, the only official details that we can give are: Bakugo Katsuki was safely rescued and uninjured. All Might is confirmed to have been discharged from the hospital.</p>\n<p>Before the livestream ended, a man without a face appeared alongside known leader of the League of Villains, Midorishi Izuku. When questioning detectives involved in the case, they refused to give a comment.</p>\n<p>For now, we wait and our questions go unanswered. Who is this faceless man? What caused the livestream to end? Will the heroes be able to stop the League of Villains?</p>\n<p>What are we going to do next?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Out of the entirety of the case, Todoroki Shouto only had a single clue to go off of; a golden and green light.</p>\n<p>That was it.</p>\n<p>It was obviously quirk based. It couldn\u2019t be anything else. So, for the last forty eight hours he scanned every quirk in the entire <em>history\u00a0</em>of the registered database to find <em>something </em>similar to whatever he saw. To whatever made Izuku disappear.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t find anything.</p>\n<p>So there he sat, computer open, curled up at his desk and feeling like the most useless person in the world. Scribbled notes and trashed papers lay around, abandoned but not forgotten. The names of everyone who might have a grudge, who might have a reason to do this (which was, admittedly, a lot considering Izuku\u00a0<em>was\u00a0</em>the Symbol of Peace). Quirk ideas, weird possibilities. Was it a hostage situation? Was it revenge? Who had the possibility, who had the power, to make Midoriya Izuku,<em> hero Deku</em>, disappear right before their eyes?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Izuku had been right there. </em>\n</p>\n<p>A knock sounded at his office door. He jerked up, sending papers flying to the floor. Shouto shook himself awake, glancing around the dark office space. A clock sat on his desk near the right corner. The time on it read 2:56 am.There was another, more insistent, knock at his door. He paused for only a second before stumbling to his feet. A piece of paper fluttered to the ground. He walked over to the door, hand on the handle but didn\u2019t open it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Who could that be\u2026?</em>\n</p>\n<p>His first thought was Uraraka or Tenya but both of them had gone home long ago. Kirishima had an early morning shift today and said he wouldn\u2019t be able to swing by until later. None of their sidekicks or workers would even think to try and interrupt him this early in the morning.</p>\n<p>Shouto opened the door. Naomasa stood there, pleasant smile on his face. A file was in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d find you here.\u201d Naomasa said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s three in the morning,\u201d Shouto replied because that was about all he <em>could\u00a0</em>say. His mind wasn\u2019t processing that Naomasa, who Shouto hadn\u2019t seen for almost a month, suddenly arrived at his door at three on the morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I would apologize but I figured you wouldn\u2019t want me to wait,\u201d Naomasa handed the file to Shouto, who quickly took it. Naomasa was never one to give out useless information. Shouto stared at the manila envelope with <em>Case B7-084576\u00a0</em>stamped on the cover.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cold case,\u201d Naomasa told him as Shouto fingered the edges of the file\u2019s sides. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>They had a lead.</p>\n<p>Shouto clutched the file to his chest like it was a lifetime. He couldn\u2019t even begin to express how much gratitude he was feeling to Naomasa. \u201c<em>Thank you</em>. Thank you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku has done so much for us. I\u2019m only returning the favor,\u201d Naomasa said and sighed. \u201cHis mom has been asking for updates on the case every two hours. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to tell her that we don\u2019t know. All Might is worried, too but he\u2019s limited on how much he can help out. He\u2019s trying not to show it, but I\u2019ve known him a long time. I\u2019ve never seen something get to him as much as Izuku\u2019s disappearance. He loves Izuku like his own son. For All Might\u2019s sake, <em>find him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouto thought of what Tenya said yesterday. The determination to find their missing friend. He looked at the file in his hands. Some of the guilt that was eating at him was finally starting to fade away, replaced by a new resolve. \u201cNaomasa-san, I <em>promise\u00a0</em><em>you\u00a0</em>we\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world needs its symbol,\u201d Naomasa said with a smile. Then he turned on his heel and left.</p>\n<p>Shouto spent the next few hours poring over this case. Every little detail noted, every name and location memorized. He scribbled notes on the margins and highlighted every sentence. He didn\u2019t even notice the time until the sun had risen and the city was starting to wake.</p>\n<p>The case wasn\u2019t much. In fact, it was basically nothing.</p>\n<p>Ten years ago, ten different people were reported missing near Takoba. There was no order to the disappearances. Men, women, children were all victims. They didn\u2019t know each other. Their families didn\u2019t know who could possibly do it. There was only one witness who told of a green and gold light right before his family\u2014a wife and child\u2014disappeared. The suspect was male, tall, and wore a hood to protect his face.</p>\n<p>No one knew where the victims went. They were never found.</p>\n<p>Shouto could still use this. He had to.</p>\n<p>Japan burned as the sun set over the horizon.</p>\n<p>Ash blanketed the nation, covering the buildings in a thick smoke. Dust curled in his lungs and burned his eyes. The fire and setting sun cast an eerily red glow throughout the empty halls of UA. Screams (the screams of thousands of innocent people fighting for their lives) could be heard in the distance. Cries of different sorts\u2014deep, guttural\u2014echoed through the empty city. Nomu were not an uncommon thing to be heard.</p>\n<p>There Izuku sat, curled up the corner of his old classroom as Japan burned around him. The halls of UA had never been so empty, so without life. He remembered running down the very same halls with his friends, eagerly rushing to their next classes as they trained to become heroes. That seemed like such a long time ago.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s throat burned as he breathed in another lungful of ash.</p>\n<p>The sound of a single pair of footsteps bounced off the walls. Izuku pulled himself tighter into a ball and tried to focus on his breathing. His head throbbed and his arms burned. His arms were bandaged down to his fingers, but the ash had covered the one white bandages a dirty grey color.</p>\n<p>The footsteps stopped directly in front of him. Izuku didn\u2019t need to look up to see who it was.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Shouto said.</p>\n<p>Izuku looked up. Shouto held out his hand. Izuku took it without hesitation and Shouto hoisted him up off the ground. No words were spoken as Shouto lead him through the empty halls of UA up to the roof.</p>\n<p>The rooftop was crowded, surrounded by various people in all shapes and sizes. Old, young, big, small. Mothers, fathers, children, civilians and heroes alike. Ochako was talking in hushed voices to a group of first years. Tenya was putting a splint on Koda\u2019s leg. Shoji and Yaomomo were huddled in a group, discussing what looked like a strategy. Hagakure was covered in so many bandages that her outline was clearly visible. Aizawa was around a group of younger students (students that should\u2019ve had their lives to learn to become a hero instead of being thrust into a battle their very first year) corralling them into a safe place. All Might was helping Recovery Girl tend to injuries.</p>\n<p>They were all tired. Knowing that the end to this chapter was coming and they had no idea who was going to live to see the next day.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Japan continued to burn.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>It was Jiro who noticed him first. She sat up from her position on the floor, both hands wrapped and leg in a splint. She smiled, but Izuku would tell she was exhausted. \u201cGlad to see you up, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ojiro nodded at him, broken tail at his side. Tokoyami was asleep two feet away, bandage wrapped around half of his face. Kacchan glanced at him only for a moment before going back to bandaging a wound on Ashido\u2019s side. All Might gave a thin-lipped smile in greeting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to have you back on the field, Midoriya,\u201d Kirishima called. The other greetings were lost to the background sounds.</p>\n<p>Ochako walked over and pulled him into a hug. When she pulled away, her smile was sad. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku answered. He glanced at Shouto who gave him a nod of encouragement in return. Eyes turned, expectant gazes of all kinds. From his friends, his family and heroes alike. They were waiting\u2014waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya\u2026\u201d Yaomomo sounded tired. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a speck on the horizon. So small that it would normally be insignificant, but Izuku knew better. He heard the nomus\u2019 roars even from here. The outline of an approaching army. They didn\u2019t have a lot of time before Shigaraki Tomura and his league would be here. The thought of the thousands of innocent lives that would suffer (or end) should they succeeded steeled Izuku\u2019s nerves.</p>\n<p>This was not a battle they could afford to lose.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday this ends,\u201d Izuku said and hoped his voice carried. All Might gave him a determined nod. \u201cNo matter what, we end this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero put a hand on his elbow. \u201cShigaraki can\u2019t beat us so easily.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have each other\u2019s backs,\u201d Tsuyu said, determined. \u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence overtook the roof. People basking in what was quite possibly their last few moments alive. Burning determination to protect and serve in order to create a better future. They shared each other\u2019s thoughts, each other\u2019s emotions until\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<em>ONE FOR ALL!</em>\u201d a voice carried across the battlefield. The voice\u2014the same voice that they first heard three years ago at USJ echoed around the empty buildings. A nomu responded to Shigaraki\u2019s cry. The heroes tensed, the battle nearing its climax. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Japan was burning <em>and burning and burning</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Izuku woke with a start.</p>\n<p>Someone was shaking him awake.</p>\n<p>He jerked up, nearly falling off the couch in the old teacher\u2019s lounge where he had been spending the night at. His breathing come out in harsh, ragged huffs. The room was dark but small strands of sunlight peaked out from the closed blinds. The dream\u2014the <em>memory</em>\u2014was still fresh on his mind.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Izuku was confused.</p>\n<p>Then, in a rush, everything came back. All for One and his quirk, the villain, Kamino. A parallel world where he was a villain. Izuku remembered the interrogation with Naomasa\u2019s alternate-self, meeting All Might. Mirio wielding One for All. Shimura Tenko being alive. Offering to help set up UA before the students arrived.</p>\n<p>Someone placed a hand on his shoulder. When Izuku turned, he only saw Shigaraki<em>.</em></p>\n<p>He was on his feet in seconds. One for All rushed to his aid before he even had a chance to think. The familiar power rushing through his system as his lighting burst to life in an array of colorful sparks. Ready to protect from <em>him</em>, from that <em>man</em>, from his <em>enemy</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Seeing the fear in Shimura Tenko\u2019s eyes made him realize his mistake.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m so sorry, oh my god, I\u2014,\u201d Izuku had rushed out, even as One for All faded.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d Tenko said, but he was shaking. He was <em>shaking</em>, looking up in fear. \u201cI-I understand. I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m gonna go\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko rushed out of the room without another world. Izuku stood there, rattled. His mind was on overdrive trying to process the memory, trying to process Tenko. His thoughts all exploded at once, leaving Izuku lightheaded and dizzy. He slid to the floor, back propped up against the couch. His hands were shaking.</p>\n<p>\n<em>ONE FOR ALL! </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku couldn\u2019t get Shigaraki Tomura\u2019s voice out of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko didn\u2019t tell Mirio what happened.</p>\n<p>Mirio already had a lot on his plate with his internship and training One for All. He didn\u2019t need to know that Tenko tried not to piss his pants every time he saw Midoriya Izuku turn a corner. In hindsight, waking Midoriya up from what Tenko assumed was a nightmare was not the best idea. Especially since he was pretty convinced the nightmare had something to do about him. Or his counterpart, at least. It had been stupid. A dumb move. How would <em>he </em>react had it been <em>Midoriya </em>that woke him up from a nightmare?</p>\n<p>Not good.</p>\n<p>The sad part of it all is that he understood <em>why\u00a0</em>Midoriya reacted like that. He understood Midoriya\u2019s fear. He felt it every time he looked at Midoriya\u2019s face. Midoriya and Midorishi looked terrifyingly similar. He could only assume Shigaraki and himself were the same.</p>\n<p>Midoriya avoided him the rest of the morning. Tenko avoided Midoriya the rest of the morning. It was childish and stupid\u2014he should really work out his problems like an adult\u2014but he couldn\u2019t shake the fear whenever he thought of seeing Midoriya again. He couldn\u2019t get the image of One for All\u2019s power <em>almost\u00a0</em>being used against him out of his mind.</p>\n<p>The combination of both of them avoiding their problems was probably the reason they ended up bumping into each other in the empty cafeteria. Karma was a <em>bitch</em>, after all.</p>\n<p>Across the cafeteria, Tenko could only watch in horror as Midoriya fucking Izuku walked in, carrying a rather large stack of books with ease and seemingly oblivious to his company. Tenko debated turning around and walking out (it wasn\u2019t like Midoriya had seen him yet), but he steeled his nerves. He couldn\u2019t avoid his problems forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Tenko said. Midoriya nearly dropped all his books in surprise. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, Tenko.\u201d Midoriya said. He sounded nervous as he placed the books on an empty table. Tenko watched him, half expecting to see One for All again. Midoriya approached him, rubbing his arms and not meeting his eyes. \u201cI was looking for you earlier. I\u2026I wanted to apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor this morning,\u201d Midoriya elaborated. Tenko stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make excuses. I shouldn\u2019t of reacted to way I did. I shouldn\u2019t have used One for All like that. It was really unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounded like Iida. If Tenko hadn\u2019t been so surprised, he might have laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026I understand, really,\u201d Tenko responded because he <em>did.\u00a0</em>Midoriya looked at his face and saw Shigaraki. He looked at Midoriya\u2019s face and saw Midorishi.\u201cWe\u2019re kinda in the same position, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tension in the air faded just a little.</p>\n<p>Midoriya stared at him and then cracked a smile. \u201cThis is going to be hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko grinned for the first time in almost two days. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy, seeing the face of his number one enemy as a friend but\u2026this was a start. \u201cI\u2019d like to consider the situation a mutual understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya seemed amused. \u201cA mutual understanding, huh?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHEEYY! Tenko!\u201d a voice called out from the other side of the cafeteria. Tenko turned, only to see Present Mic in his civilian clothes heading towards him, waving enthusiastically. \u00a0\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you in here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMic-sensei,\u201d Tenko greeted.</p>\n<p>Present Mic arrived at their little group in seconds. He looked at Midoriya before whistling in surprise. \u201cHo-boy, that is still <em>super </em>weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya smiled at him. Present Mic visibly leaned back. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were asking for me?\u201d Tenko asked to get his teacher\u2019s attention back.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>YEAH</em>!\u201d Present Mic said. He was so <em>loud. </em>Tenko tried not to cringe. Midoriya didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cAll Might said you and Mirio were helping out around UA. Thought I could use you to grade some papers and work with lesson plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya picked up the textbooks that he had set down earlier. He gave both of them a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to go. Midnight-sensei wanted these as fast as possible. It was nice talking to you, Tenko.\u201d</p>\n<p>Present Mic watched him leave. His smile was slowly falling off of his face. It seemed that Present Mic still didn\u2019t forgive Midorishi for injuring Aizawa during USJ. He turned to Tenko, giving him a once-over like he was scanning for injuries. Tenko just blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas he bothering you?\u201d Present Mic asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tenko said and stared at the place where Midoriya had left. Midoriya\u2019s words were still fresh on his mind. \u201cActually, Mic-sensei, I think it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko thought of Midoriya\u2019s smile. His apology. Their ability to hold a conversation despite being enemies. It wasn\u2019t much\u2014but it was a start. For both of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMidorishi,\u201d a familiar voice called from behind Izuku. Izuku startled, almost dropping the papers he was supposed to be carrying to Present Mic. He turned, unsurprised, to see Aizawa watching him from his place leaning against the hallway wall.</p>\n<p>Aizawa was still as sneaky as ever, Izuku noted.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Midoriya, Aizawa-sensei,\u201d Izuku said because he <em>really\u00a0</em>didn\u2019t want to be associated with a villain\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Aizawa said and beckoned him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt kind of matters,\u201d Izuku muttered but turned around and approached his teacher anyways.</p>\n<p>Aizawa wouldn\u2019t call him for no reason\u2014especially not with the high tension in UA regarding his presence in general. He would\u2019ve been stupid not to notice how all the teachers seemed to watch him closely. He knew it would take one mistake, one slip up or any reason to suspect him, and he would be gone. They wouldn\u2019t endanger their students\u2019 lives. Not with the league on the move. Not with Kamino happening less than four days ago.</p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2026well, truthfully Izuku hadn\u2019t seen his old teacher besides a few times in the hallway and that first time in the police station, but Aizawa was different. He didn\u2019t have the same wary look in his eyes that everyone else seemed to have. He didn\u2019t stalk Izuku like he was an actual villain. There weren\u2019t any sideways glances, any avoiding him. Aizawa treated him like a student. A particularly unruly student, but a student nonetheless.</p>\n<p>It was almost nostalgic in a way.</p>\n<p>(Although Izuku didn\u2019t know if it was because Aizawa truly believed him or if Aizawa thought that that he could easily be taken care of if he <em>was </em>a threat.)</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem child,\u201d Aziawa said instead and Izuku tried to hide his smile. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Aizawa turned and started leading him down the hallway. Confused, Izuku jogged to catch up, the papers still clutched firmly in his hand. Mic wasn\u2019t going to be happy that he was late\u2014Mic was probably the most wary out of all the teachers\u2014but Aizawa wasn\u2019t giving him much of a choice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Izuku asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cGym,\u201d came Aizawa\u2019s curt reply. As for <em>why </em>they were going to the gym, Izuku could only guess. He didn\u2019t dare ask out loud because he knew Aizawa wouldn\u2019t give him a straight answer. He never really did.</p>\n<p>Aizawa lead him through the familiar halls of UA towards Gym Gamma in the middle of the campus. Izuku had walked this path enough times to know it by heart but it didn\u2019t stop him from looking around at all of the campus amenities. He could distantly see the wall of Ground Beta towering above the forest trees. \u00a0Bird chirped and squirrels raced around the field, but despite that, the campus was quiet. There were no students and no teachers in sight. It was\u2026eerie in a way.</p>\n<p>Izuku hadn\u2019t been on campus after Kamino. He never realized how <em>empty\u00a0</em>it had been. With the bustle of the students gone, the campus was silent. The last time it had been like this was, well, during the war. The only difference was the lack of <em>fire</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here. You can stop muttering,\u201d Aizawa said just as Izuku almost ran face-first into the door of the gym. He hadn\u2019t even noticed they\u2019d gotten close. Aizawa was watching him from the corner of his eyes and Izuku tried not to blush. Bad habits die hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the gym?\u201d Izuku asked as Aizawa swiped his ID card and opened the gym doors. Izuku followed him inside wordlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you were a pro hero. One of my students,\u201d Aizawa said. He tossed something at Izuku, who caught it with ease. Izuku unwrapped the object, only to find an old gym uniform (the kind that he had worn as a first year many years ago) in his hands. Izuku almost laughed. \u201cI want to see that for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku fingered the material. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been in one of these. He knew he still had his old gym uniform hanging up in his agency\u2019s office, as a reminder, never to be worn again. \u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpar,\u201d Aizawa said simply. \u201cIf you truly are my student, I\u2019ll know. Better start thinking of everything I taught you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa had always been a fan of logical ruses. Izuku shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that coming to UA was just going to be another test.</p>\n<p>Izuku quickly changed into the gym uniform. It was much easier to move in that his casual clothes, though nowhere near as breathable as his hero suit. Unfortunately, his hero suit was still with Naomasa and being used for the case, but, well, you couldn\u2019t win ever battle. Izuku was just glad that is was his suit that they were keeping locked up and not Izuku <em>himself</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d Aizawa asked after Izuku had come back out on the field, changed and ready to fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady,\u201d Izuku said. Aizawa didn\u2019t even give him a chance to say anything else, instead rushing at him with alarming speed. His quirk was activated, preventing Izuku from using his own. Izuku clenched his hand into a fist and smiled.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No good hero is a one trick pony. </em>\n</p>\n<p>If this is how Aizawa wanted to play, then Izuku would show him how much he\u2019d learned. Aizawa had always taught them to never rely one hundred percent on their quirks. Beaten them black and blue until they understood. There was always the possibility of it getting taken away\u2014a near constant threat that Izuku had faced over and over and over. Izuku might have used One for All to help him get stronger but he wasn\u2019t known as the symbol of Peace\u00a0<em>because\u00a0</em>of One for All.</p>\n<p>So Izuku eased himself into a fighting stance and showed Aizawa just what they Symbol of Peace could do.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, when they were beaten and bloody and heading down to Recovery Girl\u2019s office, Aizawa nodded at him. There was a gleam in his eyes\u2014the same gleam that Izuku had seen when he did the ball toss on his first day and Aizawa had said that he had potential. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku offered him a smile. \u201cI had a good teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheeky.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been exactly six days since the incident at Kamino Ward.</p>\n<p>The media storm had finally calmed down enough that statements were given. The dead were mourned, the community slowly started to piece itself back together. Kamino was still a giant pile of rubble, but little by little the debris were cleared and the city was ready to begin anew.</p>\n<p>Not a single one of those people knew about the real problem\u2014Midoriya Izuku.</p>\n<p>In the week since Kamino, Tenko had basically been sleeping at UA. He and Mirio helped out where they could; writing lectures, grading papers, helping with lesson plans. They cleaned the halls, cleared the classrooms and watched as the dorms were built from nothing.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing was that Midoriya helped out, too.</p>\n<p>Tenko didn\u2019t know what to think about Midoriya at first. Their first real encounter didn\u2019t go so well\u2014Tenko had only been trying to wake him up because Aizawa was asking for him. He never imagined that Midoriya would react like <em>that</em>. With One for All directed at him. The wild look in his eyes as he got into a instinctual fighting stance. Midoriya had been <em>afraid</em>.</p>\n<p>Afraid of <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the week, Tenko had gotten to know Midoriya better. Midoriya was a hard worker and an honest person. Tenko appreciated that. At the beginning, he just couldn\u2019t shake the fear that always seemed to take hold of him whenever he saw Midoriya\u2019s face. Every time Tenko met his eyes, all he could see was Aizawa yelling at him to <em>run </em>before having his face smashed to the floor by the nomu\u2019s claws and Midorishi laughing\u00a0<em>and laughing and laughing</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t fair to Midoriya. He was his own person.</p>\n<p>Whereas Midorishi bared his teeth in a grin, Midoriya offered kind smiles. He cried when he was stressed, muttered when he thought of stuff. He blushed when complimented and stuttered when nervous. He was an amazing fighter from what Tenko had caught glimpses of during the times when Aizawa would take him out to the field for a spar. He was light on his feet, a quick thinker and always ready to lend a hand. He was every bit as dedicated, as kind and as honest as the Symbol of Peace should be.</p>\n<p>Tenko wondered how his world was fairing after losing their symbol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\u201cI thought I would be home by now,\u201d Midoriya had confessed to him one night, tired and anxious after a long day of working to get UA up and running again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d)</p>\n<p>There were no current leads on how to get Midoriya home. So far all they knew is that if All for One brought him here, then All for One could send him back. There was just the tiny little problem that it was <em>All for One</em>. Obviously, that wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon. With the ongoing undercover police investigation, there were constantly officers wandering the halls of UA, hoping to find anything that could help the situation. Tsukauchi-san was a frequent visitor.</p>\n<p>Yet, despite the chaos that the last week had brought, the school was still eerily silent without all the students around.</p>\n<p>Ah, well, it was fine. They\u2019d be coming back soon anyways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shimura Tenko was different.</p>\n<p>This should have been obvious the moment Izuku realized he was in a parallel world but separating someone that looked exactly like his old enemy has hard. He looked at Tenko and saw Shigaraki. He looked at Tenko and he was suddenly back at USJ, watching as Aizawa-sensei\u2019s elbow was disintegrated. He looked at Tenko and he was back on the roof of UA huddled around his beaten and broken friends, watching as Japan burned.</p>\n<p>He looked at Tenko and saw every little thing that Shigaraki ever did to him.</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t fair to Tenko. He was his own person.</p>\n<p>Izuku tried. He tried <em>so hard\u00a0</em>to see them as different people. The first day hadn\u2019t gone so well when Tenko tried to wake him up, but Izuku was determined to make it right. He wanted to see Tenko for the hero that he would become, not for the villain that his counterpart was.</p>\n<p>For the following week, Izuku did everything he could to amend his mistake. Mirio wasn\u2019t around much to mediate, so this was a problem they were going to have to fix by themselves. It took a while\u2014Izuku was struggling with his own problems and Tenko was still wary of him, but it improved little by little. By the end of the first day at UA, Tenko didn\u2019t turn the opposite way when he saw Izuku in the halls. By the fourth, Tenko greeted him back enthusiastically. On the fifth, they held a rather animated conversation about the hero industry and, by the sixth day that Izuku had been transported to this alternate reality, Tenko laughed with him and he laughed with Tenko.</p>\n<p>They were still struggling, but they were getting better. Little by little.</p>\n<p>Now, with the dorms being completed and Monday fast approaching, Izuku worried. Making friends with Tenko had been just one of his many problems. He wondered what his friends were like in this alternate reality. Wondered how he was going to fair being trapped in a place where everyone thought he was a villain. Worried about his world. He wondered how people were taking his absence. He missed his <em>own\u00a0</em>friends and <em>his\u00a0</em>mom and <em>his\u00a0</em>All Might and <em>his\u00a0</em>job. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The first week came and went without any leads but Izuku was still absolutely determined to find his way home.</p>\n<p>If he had to defeat All for One <em>again\u00a0</em>to do it, then so be it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dorms loomed above Tenko.</p>\n<p>He had watched them be built for the last week but standing here, surrounded by the excited chattering of his classmates, was a different story. Summer camp and, subsequently, Kamino was still fresh on their minds, but the dorms were a new start. A better beginning.</p>\n<p>He glanced around. His classmates were spread around the outside courtyard, having just been scolded by Aizawa-sensei for the entire Kamino incident. It was harsh and probably deserved, but Tenko didn\u2019t regret it. Out of the entire rescue group, Iida and Momo were the only ones we really seemed to be feeling any sort of remorse. Bakugo mostly looked pissed off, which wasn\u2019t unusual for him.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Bakugo, he was currently surrounded by Kaminari, Ashido, Sero, Kirishima and, surprisingly, Jiro. Bakugo only had a light suitcase compared to Todoroki and Momo, who had about fifteen different bags piled around the two of them. Tenko wondered how, exactly, they were planning on decorating their dorm rooms. Around him, Uraraka was trying to rope Iida into a conversation while Asui was staring at him from her spot next to Aoyama. Shoji and Tokoyami seemed to be content in their self-imposed exile under the shade of a nearby oak tree. Ojiro, Sato and Kouda were talking (or signing, in Kouda\u2019s case) to each other quietly. Tenko couldn\u2019t exactly tell where Hagakure was, with her being invisible and all, but he assumed she was around somewhere.</p>\n<p>He wondered how they were going to react to Midoriya, but Midoriya was nowhere to be seen\u2014Aizawa-sensei pulled him away two hours ago and he had yet to return.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, this is gonna be <em>SICK</em>,\u201d Kaminari said suddenly, throwing his bag over his shoulder. He threw open the dorm door and walked inside. Not two seconds later, the door opened again and Kaminari promptly rushed back out and down the steps, looking rather terrified. \u201cMidorishi Izuku is in our dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, so that was where he went.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>WHAT</em>?!\u201d most of the class shouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cISNT THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE DORMS TO <em>KEEP HIM OUT</em>?!\u201d Kirishima cried.</p>\n<p>Bakugo grinned something fierce. Small explosions went off in his hands and he rushed up the steps to the dorm. If it had been any other person, Tenko would have worried but Bakugo was tough. Plus, he\u2019d had the most experience with Midorishi out of all of them. Rescued from being kidnaped a week ago? No big deal to him, apparently. He was the only one who would <em>willingly\u00a0</em>pick a fight with a super villain.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo, wait<em>, no</em>\u2014\u201d Ashido tried to stop him, but it was too late. Soon, the entire class rushed after him because they were <em>heroes\u00a0</em>and that\u2019s what heroes did. Tenko really shouldn\u2019t laugh but\u2026he followed the others inside. Asui is the only one that stopped to stare at him when he entered the dorm and couldn\u2019t hide his smile.</p>\n<p>Yep, there was Midoriya, sitting on the couch next to Aizawa-sensei while his entire class gawked. Midoriya flashed them all a smile. Tenko swore he heard Tokoyami gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh?\u201d Hagakure said, her gloved hand pointing to Midoriya. \u201cAizawa-sensei?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aizawa said and then downed his entire cup of coffee like it was a shot.</p>\n<p>Aizawa was definitely fucking with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that, uh, Midorishi Izuku?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa raised a single eyebrow. He glanced at Midoriya, who shrugged, and then said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko thought the assorted looks of confusion on his classmates\u2019 faces were hilarious. Midoriya sure as hell <em>looked\u00a0</em>like Midorishi. He was missing the scar on his face and the dirty villain clothes that he usually wore, but if Tenko didn\u2019t know better, he would\u2019ve said they were the same person.</p>\n<p>Aizawa took pity on them and explained, \u201cThis is Midoriya Izuku. He\u2019s from a parallel world where he\u2019s a hero and was in this class when he was a student at UA. He was brought here on accident by the villain that All Might fought in Kamino and is staying here until he figure out how to send him home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that,\u201d Sero paused as if looking for the right words. \u201cA load of bullshit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true,\u201d Tenko stepped in. His class looked at him in surprise while Midoriya gave him a grateful look. \u201cI\u2019ve been with him for the past week. He\u2019s not Midorishi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya took over from there, \u201cSorry to barge in here, Aizawa-sensei wanted to introduce me since I\u2019ll probably be around here for a while. For now, I\u2019ll be staying at UA until a way to get me home is found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get those scar on your arms?\u201d Uraraka said and then clamped a hand over her mouth like she couldn\u2019t believe she said that out loud.</p>\n<p>Midoriya didn\u2019t seem to take offense. If anything, he looked rather abashed, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cI shattered my arms too many times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka stared at him, eyes wide. No one else was much better, not having any idea how, exactly, to respond to the situation. Tenko was pretty sure if this kept up, someone was going to pass out.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stood up from the couch and stretched. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep. Midoriya, your room is on the fourth floor to the left of mine. Don\u2019t kill each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei, it\u2019s one in the afternoon,\u201d Asui said. Aizawa continued to walk to the elevator, not bothering to respond to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Midoriya said in alarm. \u201cAizawa-sensei, I thought I was sleeping in the main building?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still getting it ready,\u201d Aizawa said and pressed the elevator button. The elevator opened with a\u00a0<em>ding\u00a0</em>and Aizawa stepped inside. \u201cYou used to live here right? It\u2019s fine. The door is open.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya stared at Aizawa like he\u2019d grown a second head. \u201cWhat have I been sleeping in for the past week?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Aizawa said just as the elevator door closed.</p>\n<p>Tenko stared at Midoriya who shot him a look of panic. If anything, Midoriya looked just as alarmed as the rest of the class. He glanced around the room, his eyes pausing on Bakugo and Todoroki. Tenko was pretty sure that Ashido was leaking acid from her fingers. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Midoriya said. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took all of five seconds for Bakugo to get over his shock and attack.</p>\n<p>Had it had been anyone else, Bakugo\u2019s attack would\u2019ve lead to a series of explosions to the face, but Midoriya was fast. He flung himself over the back of the couch, landing in a crouch. Bakugo catch himself and corrected his momentum, using it to launch another attack right where Midoriya stood. Midoriya dodged yet again, just as Bakugo left a nice charred mark in the middle of their new dorm floor. This continued for another good minute; Midoriya dodging and Bakugo attacking and destroying various new parts of the furniture. All the while, Midoriya never once used his quirk. He didn\u2019t seem mad\u2014or surprised, even. If anything, he looked resigned as he took explosion after explosion.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fight me</em>, you lying sack of shit!\u201d Bakugo snapped. Midoriya used a pillow to muffle the next explosion. The pillow turned into a pile of ash.</p>\n<p>Tenko thought that <em>maybe\u00a0</em>he should stop them, but one look at the intensity of the explosions Bakugo was giving off quickly changed his mind. He didn\u2019t really feel like visiting Recovery Girl tonight.</p>\n<p>Besides, Midoriya seemed like he had it covered.</p>\n<p>Bakugo lashed out with a right hook. Instead of dodging it like he had the previous times, Midoriya caught the fist in his hand and sighed. \u201cKacchan, please <em>do not</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>KACCHAN</em>?!\u201d Bakugo spat and yanked his hand free. He snarled, teeth showing like an animal. The explosions that sparked in his palms grew and Tenko just had enough time to think<em>, huh,\u00a0</em><em>maybe they would be rebuilding the dorms\u00a0</em>before Bakugo lashed out and\u2014</p>\n<p>Nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Bakugo\u2019s fist was not even two inches from Midoriya\u2019s face yet there were no explosions, no fire. Bakugo tore his hands away and tried the same move again with the same result. He stared at his hands as if trying to light them but nothing seemed to be working.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Bakugo said, glaring at Midoriya with as much malice as he could muster. \u201cDid you <em>do</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya had long since stopped paying attention to Bakugo. He was staring somewhere behind Bakugo, near the elevators and\u2014oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was <em>me</em>, Bakugo,\u201d Aizawa said. The entire class, who had been watching the skirmish like an interesting (albeit confusing) tennis match, turned to look at their teacher in surprise.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stood in the corridor of the dorms in nothing more than his pajamas, hair floating, eyes red and quirk activated. There was barley contained fury on his face and, for a moment, Tenko almost pitied Bakugo. \u201cWhat part of <em>don\u2019t kill each other\u00a0</em>do you not understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was going to be a long day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was, officially, the morning before the first day of class since the incident at Kamino.</p>\n<p>The previous day had been chaos. Tenko\u2019s class was still wary of Midoriya and Midoriya didn\u2019t seem to know how to make the situation better. Bakugo couldn\u2019t go within two meters of Midoriya without explosions lighting up his palms. Todoroki iced over his left side and hadn\u2019t let it melt. Kaminari sparked whenever Midoriya rounded the corner. Aoyama fiddled nervously with his belt. Iida carried around his helmet. Jiro hadn\u2019t taken off her amplifiers since yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>They expected an attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko tried his best to assure them, but he personally knew how hard it was. He had a week to talk to Midoriya, to make peace with him. A week of getting to know him, of having friendly conversations. A week getting to know that Midoriya Izuku was <em>not </em>Midorishi. His classmates didn\u2019t have that time or luxury.</p>\n<p>So it really wasn\u2019t a surprise when Ashido dropped her mug in shock as Midoriya stumbled down the dorm steps that morning before class started.</p>\n<p>Midoriya seemed to either not notice or not care as he made his way to the kitchen. Tenko\u2019s classmates gave him all a wide berth. Sato moved from his position near the kitchen counter to sit at the table. Iida leaned a little closer to Uraraka. Bakugo aggressively downed his entire cup of coffee with a snarl on his face.</p>\n<p>Midoriya poured himself a bowl of cereal, seemingly in a daze. His hair wasn\u2019t brushed and he was still in his pajamas. He blinked sleep out of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI say he\u2019s a good actor,\u201d Kaminari said, loud enough so that everyone at the table could hear him but not loud enough for Midoriya to overhear. \u201cA parallel dimension is bullshit.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaminari looked over at Midoriya. The rest of the class turned to look as well.</p>\n<p>They had just enough time to watch him stumble over to the other side of the kitchen, slam his face into the wall and drop his cereal on the ground with a <em>clang. </em>The bowl broke on impact. Milk was starting to spread everywhere. Cheerios littered the dorm floor.Midoriya stared down at the broken bowl and food that lay waste on the ground and sighed. Tenko had seen heroes fighting villains with less defeated expressions than the one on Midoriya Izuku\u2019s face at that very moment.</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked like he was about the cry.</p>\n<p>His classmates stared, unsure what to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre\u2014\u201d Kirishima said but hesitated. He seemed to realize that he was speaking to <em>Midoriya\u00a0</em>but grimaced and pushed on,\u00a0 \u201c\u2014are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI... am very stressed,\u201d Midoriya said without looking up from his lost cereal. \u00a0The entire class just watched as Midoriya Izuku stared down at the shattered remains of his breakfast and tried not to cry.</p>\n<p>Kirishima turned to Kaminari. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s acting, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku dropped his cereal.</p>\n<p>That was the start of his morning. Really, it was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. He\u2019s been holding in a breakdown for the past week but then he <em>dropped his cereal\u00a0</em>and suddenly he just wanted to curl up in a ball and just <em>stop</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Stressed\u00a0</em>was an understatement.</p>\n<p>He missed his home, missed his friends. Missed walking into the dorm and not having the younger-versions of his friends stare up at him like he was a villain. He missed his agency, his city. Missed being able to walk down the street without having to cover up his entire face in fear that the police or another pro-hero would see his face and assume he was a villain. He missed being a hero. He missed his All Might, he missed his apartment, missed his mom.</p>\n<p>All of it just felt like <em>too much\u00a0</em>yet not enough. A week in and he was no closer to going home than the moment that he was brought here.</p>\n<p>Stupid All for One and his stupid quirk.</p>\n<p>Aizawa was a help. Mostly it was just good to see a familiar face that didn\u2019t treat him too differently. Aizawa never once treated him like he would snap. Aizawa didn\u2019t hesitate to call him out when he found himself lost in thoughts. He was supposed to help Aizawa with his classes until he could return home\u2014a way of repaying UA for housing him.</p>\n<p>He hoped that helping Aizawa with classes would ease his homesickness.</p>\n<p>It only made it worse. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The younger versions of his friends stared up at him in fear. Izuku couldn\u2019t move an arm without one of them flinching or leaving the room. Yaomomo had been so surprised seeing him in the dorm hall last night that she popped a matryoshka doll right out of her stomach.</p>\n<p>It had calmed down since the morning. First period was better. Aizawa definitely helped alleviate some of the wariness of the class as well as being surrounded by several other pro-heroes on the UA payroll.</p>\n<p>But <em>better\u00a0</em>didn\u2019t always mean <em>fixed</em>.</p>\n<p>Yesterday had\u2026 not been good. If he was being honest, Izuku expected Kacchan to attack. He would have been more surprised if Kacchan <em>didn\u2019t\u00a0</em>try and hurt him in some way. Especially pre-hero teenager Kacchan who didn\u2019t know how to manage his anger and liked to resort to using his quirk in situations that he <em>definitely should not use his quirk</em>. Uraraka stopped breathing whenever he entered the room and not in a good way. Iida was avoiding him. As for the rest of his classmates, their reactions had been surprising but understandable. Izuku had clung to the hope that he <em>wouldn\u2019t </em>scare them in some way, but that hope was flushed away as soon as Kaminari had first rushed out of the dorms.</p>\n<p>Seeing Todoroki Shouto, though, was like a punch to the gut.</p>\n<p>He was just so <em>different. </em>Izuku could tell from the moment he first entered to dorm. This Todoroki was just as cold and indifferent as Izuku\u2019s Shouto when he started his first year of UA, determined to get to the top without making friends. Determined not the use his abusive father\u2019s quirk. He separated himself from the others, didn\u2019t talk to anyone. He didn\u2019t smile, didn\u2019t crack a joke. His eyes were indifferent, unfeeling.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t use his left side.</p>\n<p>Izuku thought of his Shouto\u2014thought of the way he accidently froze his burger during their shift not four weeks ago. Thought of the time where they stood on the podium, graduating together after three long years. Thought of the rooftop of UA. Thought of their first time facing off at the Sports Festival all those years ago.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I thought you wanted to win? Dammit\u2026 So why are you trying to inspire me? Which one of us isn\u2019t taking this seriously now? But I\u2026 want to be a hero too!</em>\n</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t the only one who was different. Yaomomo was lacking the confidence she was known for. Uraraka wasn\u2019t nearly as perceptive as his Ochako. Tenya was young and rough around the edges. He used his hands more than he probably should. All of them\u2014Tsuyu, Tenko, Shoji, Kaminari, Kirishima, Ashido, Aoyama, Ojiro, Koda, Sato, Jiro, Sero, Tokoyami, Hagakure and even Kacchan. They were so <em>young</em>, only first-years at UA just experiencing hardship for the first time.</p>\n<p>They weren\u2019t the people that he knew. Not yet.</p>\n<p>For the first time coming to this world, Izuku felt truly alone.</p>\n<p>Today was the first day of the new term, not that Izuku would be attending UA again. Aizawa was the one set to watch him so he, in turn, helped out where he could. Hero laws and ethics came easy to him. He\u2019d taken far more math classes in his past years than he\u2019d care to admit. He was fluent enough in English to deal with oversea hero negotiations.</p>\n<p>He never considered a job as a teacher but he could see why someone like Aizawa was drawn to it.</p>\n<p>Izuku still wasn\u2019t fantastic at the whole \u2018assistant teaching\u2019 thing, but he was getting better. Perhaps this is what All Might felt like when he first took on a teaching job.</p>\n<p>(Izuku was determined not to teach like All Might.)</p>\n<p>The end of the day was fast approaching. Izuku was in homeroom, Aizawa having left for a meeting. Class 1-A was staring at him. He offered a small smile back. They were leery, but curious. Izuku could tell that being surrounded by the teachers of UA helped alleviate some of that lasting fear.</p>\n<p>It was a start.</p>\n<p>Ashido raised her hand. Izuku, not used to people asking to be called on, just stared at her. Ashido didn\u2019t let that deter her and said, \u201cWhat am I like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku half-expected it to be a question on hero laws, so he was thrown for a loop. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Ashido said and made a funny gesture with her hands. \u201cThe me from your world. What am I like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looked at her and thought <em>young, innocent, bright eyed\u00a0</em>but instead said, \u201cExactly the same but five inches taller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI grow? <em>Awesome</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>That was the start. Soon enough, the entire class was asking questions like <em>what am I like?\u00a0</em>and <em>what changed?\u00a0</em>and <em>how did we meet?\u00a0</em>Midoriya slipped away from the podium so he could gather around the class. He missed this\u2014the chaos that always seemed to surround his friends. He explained what he knew about them and their hero agencies. About their time at UA. About their friendship and battles and strengths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Tsuyu just expanded her agency in north Japan. It\u2019s really cool! She\u2019s helped a lot of people in the recent hurricane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOcha\u2014I mean, my Uraraka hit top ten six weeks ago because of her involvement in a villain attack that happened a while back. We threw a party to celebrate it. I\u2019m really proud of her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSato just opened up his own agency. I heard he was looking at taking on some of the UA kids after the first Sports Festival. There are some really awesome students this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>The only ones who didn\u2019t ask a single question were Tenko, who sat in the back and stared out the window, Todoroki, who looked like he would rather be anywhere but here and Kacchan, who glared at him with murderous intent.</p>\n<p>Izuku thought about what would\u2019ve happened if he and Kacchan had been reversed\u2014if Kacchan had been sent here instead of himself. Izuku thought of Kacchan\u2019s explosive personality. Then thought of his alternate self. His <em>villain\u00a0</em>alternate self.</p>\n<p>The problem would\u2019ve been over before it even begun.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t even realize he\u2019d been staring at Kacchan until Kacchan slammed his hand on his desk. He snarled, small explosions lighting up his palms. \u201cWhy are you fucking <em>staring\u00a0</em>at me, you creepy ass motherfucker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cSorry, I was just thinking about my Kacchan. All for One should\u2019ve brought him here instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few snickered at the nickname. Kacchan glared at all of them. Todoroki didn\u2019t even look up from his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s lip curled. \u201cSo I could kick your ass?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Izuku said which surprised Kacchan so much that he forgot to look angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh?\u201d Hagakure said, confused. \u201cExplain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who would want to beat me up without consequences, it would be him,\u201d Izuku said and meant it. \u201cThen there would be one less villain in this world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d Kirishima said and paused. \u201cThat\u2019s mildly worrying, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka drummed her fingers on her desk, looking at Izuku with a strange expression. When he turned to look at her, she stopped. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it feel weird\u2026speaking about yourself like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku never once considered his counterpart to have any connection to him besides physical. Someone that hurt and killed for a living was no someone Izuku ever wanted to be associated with. Someone that worked under All for One was <em>definitely </em>not someone Izuku would want to be <em>anywhere near. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI like to think that myself and my counterpart are different people. Otherwise, it gets to me,\u201d Izuku glanced at the clock in the classroom and almost fell out of his chair in alarm. He stood up, gathering his things. He was going to be late, if he stayed any longer. \u201cSorry, guys. I promised I would meet with All Might. I have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he rushed out of the classroom, he pretended not to notice when Sero slipped his phone from his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When All Might called Izuku into his office, he half-expected to be scolded.</p>\n<p>He hurried down the halls, ignoring the looks of the students that passed him. He wore a hoodie over his head and a mask over his face. Being seen in 1-A was fine, they all knew, but walking around with the face of a villain in a hero school would only lead to trouble. As would announcing him to the entire school because then it would get out into the general public and\u2026well, Izuku didn\u2019t really want to think about that. It would be bad.</p>\n<p>He had no doubt that his counterpart would take advantage of that, if it were to happen.</p>\n<p>So he stayed a secret except to a handful of people and, in return, he got to wander the halls like a weirdo. It was fine, really. Wandering the halls of UA without being recognized was nostalgic. He remembered when he first came here so many years ago and his ambitions and dream. This place was his starting line, a place where he learned and grew into the person he was today.</p>\n<p>His feet took him straight to All Might\u2019s office without having to think about it. He\u2019d made the journey from Class 1-A to the office more times that he could remember. The large, wooden door was familiar and comforting. He knocked three times.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in!\u201d a voice shouted from the inside.</p>\n<p>Izuku opened the door and stepped in. The door shut behind him while Izuku took off his facemask and lowered his hoodie. \u201cAll Might? You wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might smiled at him from his place on the couch. He gestured to the empty seat in front of him. Izuku took it without hesitation. \u201cYes. Sorry this took so long to set up. I meant to call you here when the students were still gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand. These past few days have been a lot. How are you doing? Are your wounds okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might looked at him strangely, as if he didn\u2019t except Izuku to worry. <em>Tough luck</em>. Izuku always worried about everything.</p>\n<p>All Might looked down at his bandaged arms. \u201cI healed a while ago. You interrupted the fight before All for One could making any lasting injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Izuku said. That was better than what happened in his world. He won\u2019t ever forget sitting in the waiting room, wondering if All Might would make it out alive. Waiting long hours in the hospital while All Might healed. That fight had been brutal. Even though it happened years ago, Izuku still remembered how drained they had all felt, both mentally and physically.</p>\n<p>He would never forget All Might\u2019s words. <em>You\u2019re next</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the police station,\u201d All Might said and Izuku snapped his attention back to his kind-of-but-not-really mentor. \u201cYou called Tenko <em>Shigaraki</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. So that\u2019s what this was about. Izuku bit his lip, twisting his hands nervously in his lap. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might sighed. Izuku expected him to ask <em>how did this happen?\u00a0</em>or <em>why is Tenko a villain</em>? Instead, he looked at Izuku with the eyes of a man who has seen too much and asked, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I there for him?\u201d</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d been expecting.</p>\n<p>Izuku thought of how devastated his All Might had been when he found out the news. How he had hunted down any information that he could. How he had hesitated in the final battle, something that almost cost his life. His All Might regretted it enough, despite doing everything in his power to save everyone.</p>\n<p>Izuku, of all people, knew that sometimes that wasn\u2019t possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the whole story,\u201d Izuku said. He launched into what he knew from Gran Torino and All Might. About how Shigaraki had been with All for One since a young age. How All for One <em>rescued\u00a0</em>(which was a loose term) him. He took Shigaraki at his lowest point and built him up in All for One\u2019s own image. Manipulation, lying. Taking broken people and making them <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll for One has always been good at that,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cTurning people that felt useless into something he felt was useful. He knew who he was going after when he did it. That wasn\u2019t random.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might sighed, leaning back in his seat. \u201cI feel like I failed him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku said sharply. He tried to forget the haunted look in his mentor\u2019s eyes after the July Attacks. The guilt was with him, even then. \u201cAnd neither did my All Might. He once told me that my heart was too big, that I couldn\u2019t save everyone. He said that if I focused on all the people that I couldn\u2019t save, then it would destroy me. I like to think that he learned that from himself. All Might, you can\u2019t save everyone and you can\u2019t let it hurt you when you don\u2019t. Shigaraki might have been too late to save, but there are still people out there that need you. People that are living and breathing and full of life. <em>Mirio\u00a0</em>still needs you. <em>Tenko\u00a0</em>still needs you. Your students and family and friends still need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence in the room. Izuku clenched his fists so hard that his nails dug into his skin.</p>\n<p>All Might stared at him but there was a hint of a smile on his lips. He looked so, so tired but also strangely relived. \u201cI know what he saw in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy counterpart,\u201d All Might said. This was the first time someone looked at him like that\u2014warmth and kindness and friendliness. Izuku hadn\u2019t realized how much he missed not being treated like a timebomb. \u201cI know what he saw in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to think I see it too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it!\u201d Sero shouted the moment Midoriya left the room to meet with All Might. Tenko stared at the object; square and black and familiar.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku\u2019s phone was held up like a trophy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Hagakure said but she sounded more excited than angry.</p>\n<p>Iida, however, was not as excited. He tried to snatch the phone from Sero but Sero held it just out of his reach. \u201cThat is theft! You should return it immediately. UA students shouldn\u2019t engage in such behavior. It\u2019s a bad representation and you could be in a lot of trouble if you were to be caught!\u201d</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t have much time to debate the ethics of stealing and attempting to look on someone\u2019s personal device before Aizawa came to teach the last class of the day. The students quickly scurried to their seats and Sero inconspicuously pocketed the phone so no one else would see.</p>\n<p>Tenko had to admit, he was curious. Midoriya\u2019s phone didn\u2019t work, obviously, but it still had all his pictures and contacts from his world. He wondered what the Symbol of Peace kept on his phone. Yeah, stealing wasn\u2019t great. In fact, it was <em>really\u00a0</em>bad but Tenko\u2019s curiosity far outweighed his guilt.</p>\n<p>Class passed agonizingly slowly.</p>\n<p>The moment Aizawa walked out of the room and the bell rung, half the class had already gathered around Sero\u2019s desk. Todoroki and Bakugo didn\u2019t move, but they also didn\u2019t leave, either. Sero pulled out the phone like it was a winning lottery ticket and pressed the home button. To the surprise of almost everyone, it unlocked without a passcode. Sero locked the phone again right after.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw him use it earlier,\u201d Sero explained. \u201cWhen he went to check the time. He opened it. Didn\u2019t have a passcode or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little unsafe?\u201d Ojiro asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends on what he has on it, I guess,\u201d Sero said in return. Right as he was about to unlock the phone again, the door opened. Sero pocketed the phone immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya poked his head in not a moment later. \u201cDid I leave my phone in here? I can\u2019t seem to find it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Sero said and tried for his best convincing smile.</p>\n<p>Midoriya eyed them all, crowded around a single table looking like a deer caught in headlights. Tenko thought they probably looked ridiculous. \u201cI probably left it in All Might\u2019s office then\u2026What are you doing? Class is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing a homework session,\u201d Sero lied. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand Present Mic\u2019s assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked at Sero in a way that made Tenko think that they were <em>so busted</em>, but to his surprise, Midoriya didn\u2019t question them further.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me know if you find it, okay?\u201d Midoriya said and then left the room without another word.</p>\n<p>Beside Tenko, Hagakure breathed a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Sero pulled out the phone again. They crowded around to look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a violation de la vie privacy?\u201d Aoyama asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ashido said. \u201cBut he\u2019s like a <em>mega\u00a0</em>villain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>He\u2019s\u00a0</em>not a mega villain,\u201d Tenko said in defense. \u201cMidorishi is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even the slight comparison of the two made Tenko\u2019s skin crawl. Midoriya and Midorishi weren\u2019t comparable. Midoriya was kind and honest and helped out around UA whereas Midorishi broke people\u2019s bones for fun and continuously put his teachers into the hospital.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya does not have the same darkness within his soul,\u201d Tokoyami commented. Tenko found himself nodding even though he could only understand Tokoyami about fifty percent of the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Sero grinned like they all proved his point. \u201cWhat was he like? He said he knows us and went to UA! How different is his world? I just want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero pressed the home button. Instantly, his screen light up. His home screen was a picture of four people\u2014Todoroki, Uraraka, Iida and Midoriya himself\u2014all crowded around a building that Tenko didn\u2019t recognize. They looked happy, with Uraraka smiling so big that her eyes were closed. She was giving Midoriya and Todoroki bunny ears. Midoriya was mid-laugh. Even Todoroki, who Tenko hadn\u2019t seen use more than two emotions in his entire time at UA, was smiling. He looked at his friends like they had hung the stars in the sky. Iida had his arm wrapped around Uraraka\u2019s shoulders, a proud smile on his face. Tenko had never seen his friend so relaxed before.</p>\n<p>Tenko didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen Midoriya that happy, either. He wondered what he was like, surrounded by a group of friends rather than people who treated him like an almost-villain. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Todoroki, you\u2019re in his home screen,\u201d Kirishima said. Todoroki looked up from his phone with a frown but walked over anyways. Tenko counted it as a silent victory that they even got Todoroki to come over in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Todoroki smiling?\u201d Asui asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cScary,\u201d someone said. Tenko couldn\u2019t see who it was, too busy stifling his laugh. Todoroki didn\u2019t respond, too busy staring at his alternate self on the phone screen.</p>\n<p>Sero clicked his photos and navigated to his favorites. There were hundreds there from a picture of Midoriya and that gen-ed kid (Shinso? Was that his name?) at a cat cafe to various pictures of the class, all laughing and seemingly having a good time. There were an assortment of pictures and videos from the Sports Festival. Pictures of the dorm, of an apartment that Tenko didn\u2019t recognize. Pictures of All Might. Todoroki, Uraraka, Iida and Shinso seemed to be in the most pictures. Bakugo and Kirishima also made several appearances. There were, overall, at least several pictures of everyone in the class.</p>\n<p>Except for Tenko. He wasn\u2019t really surprised but it didn\u2019t stop the guilt from curling in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Todoroki, you\u2019re in a lot of these,\u201d Uraraka commented. Tenko wondered how Midoriya got someone like <em>him\u00a0</em>to open up, let alone become friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou and Iida are in more than I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uraraka paused, thinking. \u201cYeah but you\u2019re\u2026..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a cold-hearted asshole?\u201d said Kaminari who had a death wish. Todoroki stared at him until he wilted back into his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that the purple haired brainwashing kid from the Sports Festival?\u201d Jiro asked, taking the phone from Sero and swiping back to the picture of Shinso. Tenko was <em>sure\u00a0</em>that was his name, but he honestly didn\u2019t remember much about him from their fight. That had been brutal.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s him alright,\u201d Bakugo snapped. Tenko was surprised that he even came over. Especially given that Tenko didn\u2019t notice when he did. \u201cWhat the fuck is that piece of shit doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>No one really had a response to that. Tenko didn\u2019t know much about the guy past their battle at the Sports Festival (where Tenko lost) and his declaration of war beforehand. He only knew the guy was determined to be a hero. Maybe he succeeded?</p>\n<p>Sero flipped to Midoriya\u2019s last text messages to see if there was an answer there. The first text message was from Todoroki, who was labeled \u201cShouto\u201d in Midoriya\u2019s phone. Tenko was not the only one surprised by that. Naturally, curiosity got the better of them and Sero clicked to read his last text messages.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>Shouto</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Last Monday, 12:34pm</p>\n<p>You're late.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Last Monday, 12:37pm</p>\n<p align=\"right\">youve been late the last three times, shouto</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aren't you the one one who's always harping about us being on time?</p>\n<p align=\"right\">absolutely not thats tenya</p>\n<p align=\"right\">anyways im almost there!! just hold on !! \u0b18(\u0a6d*\u02ca\u1d55\u02cb)\u0a6d*</p>\n<p>Last Monday, 12:42pm</p>\n<p>Please don't ever use that face again.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">(\u3063\u00ba\u0414\u00ba)\u3063</p>\n<p>Last Monday, 12:46pm</p>\n<p>Izuku.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">do whatever u want five peepee man</p>\n<p>I regret ever telling you that story.</p>\n<p>Hurry up. People are starting to stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey seem\u2026close,\u201d Yaomomo commented. Tenko huffed out a disbelieving laugh. He didn\u2019t think <em>anyone\u00a0</em>could be <em>close</em>to Todoroki, but this seemed to prove otherwise. Todoroki stared at the phone and if Tenko didn\u2019t know any better, he would\u2019ve said Todoroki was <em>curious</em>. He wondered what changed in Midoriya\u2019s world. Why Midoriya\u2019s Todoroki seemed to actually <em>show emotion</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe called Todoroki Shouto, son of Endeavor and one of the few students to get in on recommendations, Five Peepee Man,\u201d Hagakure said, dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>Tenko noticed Todoroki flinch. He didn\u2019t stop to wonder why.</p>\n<p>Sero clicked on the next text message, from his mom. Tenko didn\u2019t think their Midorishi even <em>had\u00a0</em>a mom.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>Mom</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Last Monday, 9:38am</p>\n<p>I love you so much. I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019ll see you soon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko bit his lip and tried not to feel bad. He knew that if he were the one to be sent away, he\u2019d miss Mirio and Gran and All Might more than anything. He couldn\u2019t even imagine himself in Midoriya\u2019s position, isolated and alone in a world that hates him.</p>\n<p>Iida frowned at the phone. \u201cI bet he misses all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko whipped around so fast that he nearly fell out of his chair. Kirishima, however, wasn\u2019t so lucky and went tumbling. The rest of the class stared in surprise as Midoriya Izuku leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed and a sad smile on his face. Sero gapped at him, trying to ask a question that wouldn\u2019t come out.</p>\n<p>Midoriya only raised an eyebrow in amusement. \u201cI\u2019ve known all of you for over seven years. Sero, you're a terrible liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, damn,\u201d Sero said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you wanted to see my pictures, you could\u2019ve just asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sero handed over the phone, a little guilty. Midoriya took it and, instead of pocketing it and leaving like Tenko expected him to, opened his pictures again. He scrolled through some that Sero had overlooked earlier. He gave context, told stories of adventures and shenanigans. He seemed happy to share and the class asked as many questions as they could.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is when Tenya, Ocha, Shouto and I opened our own hero agency,\u201d Midoriya said and showed them the very same picture that was his home screen.</p>\n<p>There was a proud smile on his face, the very one that was echoed in the picture. He opened another picture of the entire class in graduation gear with medals around their necks. Some had bandages around their entire bodies. Midoriya himself was almost covered head to toe, but yet, they all looked incredibly joyous. Some even in tears, as they gathered around for their group shot.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is when we graduated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey look happy,\u201d Tenko found himself commenting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were,\u201d Midoriya smiled. He then went through an assortment of other pictures. \u201cThis was third year Sports Festival. It was the first time I won. This was my 17<sup>th </sup>birthday. Everyone threw a surprise party in the dorms. This was first year Sports Festival. This was our first year Cultural Festival.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flipped to a picture of the entire class gathered in a tiny apartment. All Might was carrying a cake around his students who were laughing and cheering as Uraraka held up her and Todoroki\u2019s hands in victory. \u201cThis is the celebration when Ocha hit the top ten and Shouto got number three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Ashido said and snatched the phone from Midoriya\u2019s hands. She flipped to a picture that Midoriya had skipped over before handing it back. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to admit,\u201d Iida said. \u201cI\u2019m curious as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>The photo wasn\u2019t like the others. There were three people there\u2014Uraraka, Iida and Midoriya. Their faces were covered in blood, sweat and ash. Dried tear tracks ran down both Midoriya and Uraraka\u2019s face. Uraraka seemed to be supporting most of Midoriya\u2019s weight. Iida\u2019s hair was matted in grime. They looked like they went through hell.</p>\n<p>Yet, there were large, relived smiles on all of their faces.</p>\n<p>Behind them, the sun was rising and illuminating a smoke and ash covered land. It was something out of a horror movie; buildings were reduced to rubbed, fires were still flickering.</p>\n<p>They seemed to be on a roof. Tenko wasn\u2019t exactly sure where. Uraraka, Iida and Midoriya weren\u2019t alone. In the background, Todoroki could be seen helping Bakugo to his feet. Shoji was using crutches. Aoyama was laying on the floor. Tenko swore he looked dead. Asui was bandaging Sato\u2019s bloody arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026..that was directly after the war,\u201d Midoriya said. He stared at the picture in his hands, hands clasped tight around the edges of the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe war?\u201d someone asked.</p>\n<p>Midoriya nodded, seemingly lost in thought. \u201cDuring our last year at UA, we faced off Shigaraki Tomura and his army. We were at the center of the attack, of course, because we\u2019ve been involved since the day they attacked USJ. The war\u2026was hard. A lot of people died. But when the sun came up, we were still there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko tried not the cringe. His alternate-self seemed like a\u00a0<em>really\u00a0</em>terrible person.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ashido breathed.</p>\n<p>She was staring at the picture, almost in awe. The rest of the class fell silent. Even Bakugo didn\u2019t say a word. He was too busy glaring himself and Todoroki in the background. Tenko would\u2019ve loved to know what he was thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Why do you call Todoroki Shouto <em>five peepee man</em>?\u201d Kaminari couldn\u2019t hold his question in any longer.</p>\n<p>Todoroki glared at him. Tenko was mostly just surprised at the tone whiplash. After all, he also wondered what sort of thing Todoroki must have done to be called <em>five peepee man</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya had to bit his fist to keep from laughing. Todoroki turned his glare to Midoriya. Midoriya, seeing everyone\u2019s expressions, launched into his tale, \u201cWell, you see, Shouto failed his provision exam due to some, uh, circumstances and was put in a remedial course with a few other people\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Tenko found himself locked away in his dorm room, staring at his bare ceiling in thought. The first day had already been a whirlwind of surprises and emotions. He learned more that he thought he would\u2014in hero class, about Midoriya. He almost wished he could see Midoriya\u2019s world for himself. His friends and family, all of them seemed so <em>close</em>. When Tenko thought of all the people in 1-A, he could count the number of people he considered friends on one hand. The rest were just, well, classmates.</p>\n<p>It was different for Midoriya. Midoriya, who lit up when he go to talk about the very same people who Tenko could barely consider acquaintances. Who kept in contact with all of them well after graduation. He seemed close to all of them. To Midoriya, all of 1-A were all his friends.</p>\n<p>Tenko wondered why it wasn\u2019t like that for them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>NUMBER ONE HERO DEKU MIA?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Over the last week and a half, hero Deku has made a surprising lack of appearances. Since the start of his debut during his third year of UA, Deku has been a constant presence in the hero industry. He rose to fame after the July Attacks, taking the lead and finally ending the League of Villain\u2019s tyranny. He was one of the first to organize and contribute to clean up after the battle and was the representative of the notorious Class 1-A to calm the masses.</p>\n<p>Since then, he has been in the hearts of millions. He has made appearances every day for the last two years, which means it is easy to notice when he doesn\u2019t show up. The last time his appearance was reported was last Monday, where he stopped a convince store robbery. He has yet to make an appearance since then. Fans and heroes alike are worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really look up to him,\u201d comments a second year in the UA heroics department. \u201cHe saved my life during the July Attacks. He was my reason to become a hero. I hope wherever he is, that he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reaching out to his agency revealed nothing. Heroes Uravity and Ingenium were not available to talk. Police currently are not giving out any information on Deku\u2019s whereabouts. We reached out to his former classmates as well, but no one seems to have an answer.</p>\n<p>Is this the end for our Symbol of Peace?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Comments: 245 (show less)</p>\n<p><strong>tinywee69: </strong>is any1 else like\u2026..worried</p>\n<p><strong>dekuno1fan: </strong>this is hero deku were talking about guys. im sure hes just taking the week off and didn\u2019t want villains to take advantage of that lol</p>\n<p><strong>uravititty</strong>: ahh man i miss deku!! i hope he turns up again soon!!</p>\n<p><strong>minuymu: </strong>deku disappeared before i could tell him that i would die for him</p>\n<p><strong>yaboyhero: </strong>multiple agencies &amp; the police won\u2019t give information on deku\u2019s health or whereabouts\u2026that\u2019s a little suspicious. i hope hes ok.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the tenth day that Midoriya Izuku was missing, Bakugo burst into Shouto\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>He slammed the door open with such force that it made a dent in the wall. The wind from the impact blew Shouto\u2019s papers to the floor. Shouto tried not the be annoyed, he really did, but Bakugo has always been a pain in the ass and Shouto was <em>not </em>in the mood to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Besides, Izuku was more than half of Shouto\u2019s voice of reason when it came to not pissing Bakugo off.</p>\n<p>Ochako rushed in moments later, looking out of breath. Kirishima and Tenya were both close behind. They, too, looked like they just ran a marathon.</p>\n<p><em>They probably chased Bakugo all the way up to the fifth floor of the building</em>, Shouto thought as he went to collect his case papers off the floor. Bakugo was glaring at him from the front of his office. He really didn't want to deal with this today. Kirishima was much better at dealing with Bakugo than he was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo, you can\u2019t just rush in here!\u201d Ochako said sternly.</p>\n<p>Out of all the people in this room, Bakugo only listened to two of them. One, being Ochako who he\u2019d been impressed with since the day she took him on during their first year Sports Festival, and Kirishima who had wedged himself into Bakugo\u2019s life and never really left.</p>\n<p>Shouto, personally, couldn\u2019t see <em>why</em> Kirishima would want to be friends with someone like Bakugo. Shouto could work with him on hero cases just fine; years of teamwork training and pure combat skilled helped with that. Any longer than that? No. Bakugo as a person, in Shouto\u2019s humble opinion, was terrible. However, Ground Zero was number two hero for a reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m joining the fucking case, Icy Hot,\u201d Bakugo snapped, ignoring both Ochako and Kirishima\u2019s protests. He stood, in his hero outfit, tall and unwavering. His arms were crossed over his chest and there was a scowl on his face.</p>\n<p>Shouto raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugo and Izuku\u2019s relationship was\u2026strange to say the least. Shouto didn\u2019t understand it. What he <em>did </em>understand was that their relationship had improved drastically from when they were kids. Izuku once said that he saw Bakugo as something of a rival, even though Bakugo never had a chance at the number one spot.</p>\n<p>Not with his nasty personality, at least.</p>\n<p>Even so, the two didn\u2019t really meet up outside of hero work and reunions. Kirishima was usually there to mediate those meetings as well. Shouto, for the life of him, couldn\u2019t figure out why Bakugo was insistent enough to work on Izuku\u2019s missing case that he flew in from his agency\u2019s own city.</p>\n<p>Bakugo glowered at him. \u201cI\u2019m not about the be number one hero by <em>default</em>. You pulled that shit during the Sports Festival.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>That would make much more sense than joining out of the goodness of his heart, yet, Shouto felt like something was off. Looking at Bakugo, Shouto could tell that there was more to it than that. Shouto has seen Bakugo competitive and angry. He'd seen Bakugo's drive firsthand during their first year when he refused to use his fire. He certainly was speaking the truth to some extent, but the look in his eyes\u2026there was something more. Something that Bakugo wasn't saying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Bakugo\u2019s way of saying <em>I\u2019m really worried and I would like to help</em>,\u201d Kirishima added on helpfully. Ochako snorted under her breath. Tenya looked like he was ready to kick all of them out of Shouto\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>Shouto met Bakugo's eyes. The determination, the drive, the experience. All would help the case rather than hinder. Shouto found that he couldn\u2019t say no.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. This is all we have,\u201d Shouto sighed.</p>\n<p>He slid the small case file that Naomasa had given him just days before over to Bakugo. Bakugo snatched it from the table and flipped it open. As he read the case file, his expression grew more and more incredulous. Had it been any other case, Shouto probably would've laughed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me,\u201d Bakugo said. He read the top of the paper with a scowl, looking over the witness reports. \u201cThis is a fucking <em>cold case</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouto smiled bitterly, leaning back in his office chair. In his hand, Bakugo held the results of\u00a0the countless hours that they had spent searching until they were too exhausted to continue. Just\u00a0five little papers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the search, Ground Zero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! <em>Midoriya</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku whipped around at the sound of his name. Several of the students around him glanced at him curiously. Midoriya pulled his hoodie lower over his head, looking for the person that called him.</p>\n<p>When he spotted the alternate version of the blonde-haired senior that mentored him rushing over to him from the other side of the quad, he couldn\u2019t help his surprise. \u201cMirio-senpai?\u201d</p>\n<p>(<em>Yes</em>, it was weird calling someone younger than himself <em>senpai. </em>However, it was even more weird <em>not </em>calling Mirio senpai.)</p>\n<p>Mirio, apparently, thought the same thing as he rushed up to Midoriya with a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s upper weird seeing your face and hearing you call me that! Tenko\u2019s told me a lot about you but I haven\u2019t really gotten to meet you other than the police station!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-oh! Right, uh,\u201d Izuku fumbled over his words.</p>\n<p>People were starting to stare. Mirio seemed to notice and grabbed his arm, dragging him away. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go someplace private? I have a lotta questions to ask!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku almost signed in relief. Someplace private, he could do. \u201cAlright. I have an idea.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku lead Mirio away from the quad and back into the school. Mirio followed, surprisingly quiet. He seemed to be studying Izuku\u2019s back as Izuku lead him through hordes of students until, finally, they arrived at a staircase towards the back of the building.</p>\n<p>Izuku spotted Mirio\u2019s confused look and grinned. He walked underneath the staircase, looking for the small trigger\u2026Ah, there it was.</p>\n<p>Izuku glanced around to make sure no one was close to them before pushing the trigger. A passage opened in the little tiny space behind the stairwell. Mirio gapped in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Izuku said.</p>\n<p>The passage wasn\u2019t long, but it was dark. As soon as Mirio and Izuku entered, the door slammed shut. Izuku took out his phone and turned on the flashlight, leading Mirio further into the tunnel. The tunnel was damp and cold, much like something you would expect out of a cheesy horror film.</p>\n<p>The last time Izuku had been in here, it had been filled with so much smoke that he could barely breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mirio brushed his hands against the tunnel wall. \u201cI\u2019ve been here three years and I never knew about this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku said. He remembered his own surprise when he was first in here. \u201cIt\u2019s a transportation tunnel. We found it during the war. Well, more precisely, Nedzu <em>let\u00a0</em>us find it during the war. UA is full of them, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku could dimly see the door in front of them. It was old and worn, but it looked exactly the same as it did all those years ago. He pushed it open with some effort, letting the light shine in. He stepped outside, taking in the view of UA\u2019s highest roof.</p>\n<p>The last time he\u2019d been here, Japan had been on fire. Now, looking out at the vast expanse of his home, it was hard to even imagine. The distant chatter of the students, hundreds of feet below and they bustled from class to class. Izuku could see the train station, the office buildings. He could see homes and apartments full of people that were getting ready for their day. He could hear the train\u2019s horn and the cars honking and the people laughing. Izuku couldn\u2019t help but feel relieved. They <em>would\u00a0</em>stop that future from happening.</p>\n<p>Japan didn\u2019t have to burn for them to win.</p>\n<p>Mirio stood beside him. He was looking at students that bustled around, the train that just left the station. He almost looked wistful. He shot Izuku a joking grin. \u201cWe could have just gone to an empty office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughed. \u201cThis is cooler. And I figured, well, you should know. Just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio stared at him for a second before a somber smile took over his features. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They settle on the edge, feet dangling from the side. Hundreds of feet below, a group of students entered the building, laughing and screaming. Izuku watched them with a smile, thinking of his time here at the UA. A <em>lot\u00a0</em>had changed since then.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mirio said, swinging his legs. \u201cHow\u2019d you get One for All?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinked in surprise. He, yeah, he should\u2019ve guessed that was what Mirio wanted to talk about. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate to admit that he had his own questions about it. How did One for All work with Mirio\u2019s quirk? Did he combine the two or keep them separate? Does One for All allow for more control over his other quirk? Did the quirks cancel each other out? Did\u2014</p>\n<p>Mirio cleared his throat. Izuku cut himself off with a blush. He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d been muttering. \u201cSorry, I got distracted. I already told you about how I got One for All, during the interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but that was during an interrogation,\u201d Mirio said brightly. \u201cI want to hear it from you, personally. No police or mentors or teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to spy on me?\u201d Izuku asked, jokingly. Mirio grinned at him. He\u2019d forgotten how much he missed talking to Mirio. Mirio was a bright, happy and honest person, someone that Izuku had always looked up to. It had been too long since he\u2019d seen him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to, actually. In fact, Sir wanted you. He hated me at first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio laughed in surprise. \u201cSir did?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! I tried to intern with him...right around this time, actually. I\u2019m assuming Tenko is going that route too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mirio said. \u201cSir contacted him a little bit before Kamino. That\u2019s weird that he hated you. He really loves Tenko.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTenko didn\u2019t get One for All.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Alright, fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo answer your question,\u201d Izuku said and thought back to the first time he met All Might. That seemed like such a long time ago. \u201cHe saved me from a villain in middle school. I was quirkless at the time. I asked him if I could become a hero and he told me no. Later, Kacchan\u2014uh, Bakugo Katsuki\u2014was attacked by the very same villain that attacked me. All Might had used up his time already and I felt responsible. The heroes couldn\u2019t do anything, but I rushed in anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Tenko are both so reckless,\u201d Mirio said.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people tell me that,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cAll Might offered me One for All directly afterwards. It felt like a dream come true. I\u2019d always dreamed of being a hero. There were a lot of people that doubted me. All Might though\u2026.All Might always believe in me. Sometimes I feel like I could never live up to his expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio leaned back against his hands, looking up at the sky. There were birds circling above. Mirio looked like he were almost yearning to go up there, to be like those birds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I know how you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Aizawa took all of 1-A and Izuku to Ground Beta.</p>\n<p>Izuku followed, a little uncertain. He\u2019d spent the last week sparring against Aizawa in this very place to test where he was as a hero. The large, metal structures loomed above them. Class 1-A fiddled with their prototype hero outfits. Izuku, for the first time since he arrived, was decked out in his own. He tugged at his reinforced gloves when he noticed a few people in 1-A were staring at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0He knew was Aizawa was planning, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to like it.</p>\n<p>Aizawa stopped them all about ten feet inside Ground Beta. He made the class get in a semi-circle before putting Izuku in the center of them. Not one to hate any time, Aizawa said, \u201cCongrats. Today, you get to spar against a pro hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku waved sheepishly. The class exploded.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he the, uh, number ONE HERO?!\u201d Kirishima said incredulously. Beside him, Ashido was staring at Izuku with wide eyes. Tenko looked hesitant. The others ranged anywhere from worried to excited to murderous (or, in Kacchan\u2019s case, a weird mix of the last two).</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d Aizawa said.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Hagakure\u00a0said, sounding just the slightest bit panicked. Torodoki was eying him and Kacchan\u00a0was grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of it as a trade,\u201d Izuku said, if only to calm them down a little. \u201cI train you and you learn my fighting style. Since it\u2019s a parallel world, my counterpart is bound to have similar styles. This could help you out in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all have one hour,\u201d Aizawa said. He held a stop watch in his hands. \u201cDeku versus all of you. Time starts now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was rushed almost immediately by Kacchan and Todoroki. Kacchan went for his usual right hook and Izuku flipped him over his shoulder with ease. Kacchan spat in rage, flipping himself to his feet in the span of a second. Todoroki sent an entire ice wall at him. Izuku fired up One of All and blasted the wall into tiny little pieces with just a single finger.</p>\n<p>Izuku grinned and gave them all a two-finger salute. Then, he sprinted deeper into Ground Beta.</p>\n<p>\u201cGET BACK HERE, <em>YOU FUCK</em>!\u201d Kacchan hollered from behind. The rest of the class gave chase.</p>\n<p>It was only around thirty seconds into the exercise and Izuku could already tell that Todoroki didn't use his fire. At all. He\u2019d known this for quite some time, but seeing his ice in action only cemented the fact in his mind. In fact, the Todoroki of this word reminded him of that kid he met his first year. The one that challenged him during their first Sports Festival. The one that was consumed by his hatred towards his father. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It made him sad.</p>\n<p>Shouto has been one of his best friends for years now. He\u2019d been with him for almost everything\u2014from the Hero Killer in Hosu to the end in the July Attacks. Izuku had watched him change (<em>helped</em> him change) into the person that he was today. The hero that offered his everything, that helped people without question. The type of hero who used <em>all\u00a0</em>his power. The type of hero that Shouto had promised his mom that he would be.</p>\n<p>Another wall of ice cut Izuku off. He could\u2019ve easily jumped over it, but stopped and waited. Todoroki, ahead of the rest of the class, cut him off. He looked down at Izuku with stone cold determination.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go on forever not using your fire,\u201d Izuku called.</p>\n<p>Todoroki's eyes only became colder. He readied his fist for another ice attack. \u201cWhat do <em>you</em> know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot more than you think I do, I bet,\u201d Izuku said then promptly slammed Todoroki to the ground and out of the way. The rest of the class caught up in the few seconds that Izuku had exchanged with Todoroki. They\u00a0surrounded\u00a0him, pushing his back to the ice wall. Izuku spotted Aizawa watching carefully from one of the nearby buildings.</p>\n<p>Aizawa wanted him to teach them? Fine, he would teach them. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaminari sent a bold of lightning at him. Izuku dodged and immediately blocked an attack from Kacchan. The lightning hit almost ten feet from its original target. \u201cKaminari, instead of focusing on where the lighting is going, focus on how you want it to move! It\u2019s the journey not the destination!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe destination is kinda important!\u201d Kaminari shouted back before sending another off-target lightning bolt.</p>\n<p>Kirishima lunged at him. Izuku caught his wrist, nailed\u00a0him in the soft part of his stomach and sent him into Hagakure, who had been trying to sneak up behind him. \u201cKirishima, instead of focusing on hardening one part of your body, harden all of it! Hagakure, lighten your steps! I can still hear you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Iida rushed at him, trying to knock him off balance. Izuku sent him tumbling into the dirt on top of Hagakure and Kirishima. They all groaned. \u201cIida, you need to be faster!\u201d</p>\n<p>A noise came from behind him. Izuku barely had to turn to know how it was. He caught Kacchan\u2019s fist before it could explode and held it tight. Kacchan snarled and struggled to get free. He sent Kacchan tumbling into\u00a0the ground for a second time that day.</p>\n<p>Izuku grinned. \u201cKacchan, try not to be so predictable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>DON\u2019T FUCKING CALL ME THAT!</em>\u201d Kacchan hollered and steadied himself yet again.</p>\n<p>From there, it was only a matter of time before the rest of the class was out for the count. They were strong, they always had been, but Izuku had the advantage of One for All, his experience\u00a0<em>and </em>knowing them all in the future. He knew all of their current moves, all of their habits, and all of the moves that they would come up with in the next few years. He\u2019d worked with them as a team since they were all fifteen<em>. </em>Nothing they could do at this point would surprise him.</p>\n<p>It was, admittedly, a little unfair.</p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what Izuku thought until he turned, only to see Tenko lunge at him. Izuku only saw bloodshot eyes and a man covered in hands reaching forward with five fingers. Izuku flinched so hard that he almost hit the ice wall, but quickly corrected himself. He sent a blast of air to knock Tenko off balance and quickly sent him to the dirt.</p>\n<p>Izuku tried to stop his ragged breathing. His heart was beating wildly. For a second, Izuku had only seen Shigaraki.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>He pushed down his feelings and hid them with a smile. Tenko was not Shigaraki. He was not, he was not<em>, he was not\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei, <em>mon dieu</em>, this was a terrible idea,\u201d Aoyama groaned from his place on the ground. He didn\u2019t seem terribly inclined to get back on his feet. Aizawa looked like he was trying to fight a smile. \u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Aizawa is enjoying this too much</em>, Izuku thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s beating us by barely doing anything,\u201d Jiro muttered, face full of dirt.</p>\n<p>Tsuyu picked herself off the ground and brushed dirt from his costume. She stared at Izuku critically. \u201cIt\u2019s like he knows what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Izuku agreed. He ignored it when half the class groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve known you all for years. I know all your current and future moves. We've all sparred enough times that I know your styles as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen WHY are we doing this?!\u201d Sero said, looking at Aizawa accusingly. A portion of his costume had ripped down the side. The rest of the class started picking themselves off the ground, preparing to attack once again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to get better. Think of your advantages.\u201d Izuku told them. He might have to help them here\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you have over me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Skill</em>,\u201d Kacchan snapped.</p>\n<p>Uraraka seemed to get it, though, and snapped her fingers in excitement. \u201cNumbers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku fired up One for All. Only at fifty percent, but fifty percent would be more than enough here. \u201cRight! What can you do with numbers?\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the class seemed to catch on.</p>\n<p>Tokoyami said, \u201cTeamwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku grinned as he watched the class puzzle together a way to beat him. Maybe this is what Aizawa felt when teaching. Izuku couldn\u2019t say he disliked it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen do it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t win.</p>\n<p>It was to be expected, really. Izuku was <em>number one</em> for a reason and fighting against fifteen year old versions of his friends and his enemy...well, the fight wasn\u2019t the hardest he\u2019d had.</p>\n<p>The class was different. Not as in-tune as Izuku remembered being. Izuku remembered their teamwork being much more fluid than what Class 1-A showed him today. They had the experience, sure, but they weren't all there. They weren\u2019t as close as he was with his friends.</p>\n<p>Izuku could see that with Todoroki and he could see that with Tenko, too.</p>\n<p>Really, Izuku excepted Tenko to be the most difficult. He rubbed the scars along his left arm, covering from his elbow down to his wrist. The skin was patchy and uneven from the skin grafts that had to be placed there. Izuku had always known Shigaraki as a savage fighter. Tenko was different. He had only directly approached once during the entire battle, in the beginning. After that, he seemed to stick with support. Offering help where he could. His quirk was dangerously effective at changing the landscape to suit him best, but Izuku noticed that he didn\u2019t use his quirk very often. When he did, he hesitated.</p>\n<p>It was almost like he was <em>scared\u00a0</em>of using his quirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class ended. Izuku rushed after Todoroki without a second thought. He spotted him heading for the dorms, bag slung over his shoulder. He ignored anyone and everyone who approached him, quickly making his way through the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cTodoroki! Wait up!\u201d Izuku called.</p>\n<p>Todoroki only stopped to glare at him. \u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku couldn\u2019t help but compare this Todoroki to his Shouto. The mannerisms, the anger, the fear. All of it was so familiar, yet so different.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not your father. Your fire is not your father\u2019s quirk. Who you are and what you do with your own quirk is up to you,\" Izuku offered a small, sad smile. \"I know this won't mean much to you now, because you don't know me but I know <em>you</em>. And I know that right now it seems hard, but someday in the future everything will make a little more sense. That\u2019s all I wanted to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku turned on his heel and walked off, leaving Todoroki there, stunned.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>HERO DEKU confirmed MIA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Number One Hero Midoriya Izuku \u201cDeku\u201d has been confirmed missing in action. His agency has reported that he has been missing since last Monday, however they insist that they are doing all they can to find him. No information about the case has been given to our reporters as of yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku is strong,\u201d Hero Uravity comments. \u201cWe need to believe in him. He will be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot tell you any details as of yet,\u201d Ingenium says. \u201cBut rest assured that the case is being thoroughly reviewed by our agency. Ground Zero and Red Riot have both offered their help. Deku will be found.\u201d</p>\n<p>The police would not give any statements but they do issue a warning to all villains that might try and take advantage of the symbol of peace\u2019s disappearance: <em>don\u2019t</em>. Pro heroes have stated that they will up upping their presence until Deku has been found.</p>\n<p>For now, we will wait and hope that Deku comes back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Comments: 876 (show less)</p>\n<p><strong>hhghytly:\u00a0</strong>i fucking CALLED IT</p>\n<p><strong>hhotthero!:\u00a0</strong>DDDEEKKKKKUUUUUUUUUU</p>\n<p><strong>lazyretro:\u00a0</strong>oh god, that\u2019s so bad. does anyone remember the time all might retired? it was bad then, too.</p>\n<p><strong>no1mightfan:\u00a0</strong>villains are definitely going to take advantage of this\u2026.</p>\n<p><strong>d-d-deku:\u00a0</strong>hope deku\u2019s ok!!</p>\n<p><strong>redriotttttt456</strong>: oOHHHOHONONOOOO NOT DEKU!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of the first things Todoroki Shouto learned was that life didn\u2019t always go as planned.</p>\n<p>It had been almost two weeks since they\u2019ve seen Izuku. Eleven days without the Symbol of Peace.</p>\n<p>Despite Ground Zero\u2019s help, they had hardly made any progress in the case. Finding an unfindable man was never easy. Now, with the media knowing that Deku was missing and the stress of wondering if his friend was even\u00a0<em>alive</em>, Shouto hadn\u2019t got much sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Shouto said, head in his arms. The papers beneath him did nothing to comfort him. Ochako let out a sigh from her place propped up on the desk. She kicked the side of Shouto\u2019s chair absent mindedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019d known Izuku since the start. This was hurting her, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouto,\u201d she said. He didn\u2019t look up from his place in his arms. \u201c<em>Someone\u00a0</em>did this. We <em>are </em>going to find them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could feel the guilt swirling in his chest. He was there. He watched it happen. He should\u2019ve stopped it. Izuku was right\u00a0<em>there</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Izuku had been the <em>only one\u00a0</em>there.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one was there, Ochako. If it was a quirk then we have <em>nothing</em>. The villains were tied up. Their quirks have been identified. All the civilians were evacuated. There was <em>no one</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku was gone. They didn\u2019t know why. They didn\u2019t know if he was still alive. Was he hurt? Was he scared? Was he fighting for his freedom right that very second? <em>Was he still breathing</em>? Perhaps not knowing was worse than knowing. At least, then, there wouldn\u2019t have been as many questions.</p>\n<p>Ochako tugged the case file out from under him. Shouto looked up. She handed him a single piece of paper with the headline <em>Witness Report</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s a witness right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaomasa-san already sent some officers last week. Reports say he didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Well, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time <em>we\u00a0</em>paid him a visit?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mirio cornered Izuku again in an empty hall on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d Mirio asked. Izuku nearly dropped the hero equipment that he\u2019d been carrying to Aizawa. He stared at Mirio in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne for All,\u201d Mirio elaborated. Izuku didn\u2019t think he <em>needed\u00a0</em>to be taught. \u201cHow you use it\u2014it\u2019s different from how I use it. Plus\u2026 I love All Might and all but\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a great teacher,\u201d Izuku finished. He felt a smile tug at the corner of his mouth as he thought of All Might\u2019s <em>Teaching For Dummies</em> book that still sat on the bookshelf in his apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he gets better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio laughed. \u201cI have a solid grasp on One for All but the way Tenko said you use it was interesting. I figured we could train together or something. Maybe not in any strange, dark passageways\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku, who\u2019d been wanting to see Mirio use One for All since he found out Mirio had it, jumped on this idea. \u201cI think we can work something out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>class 1-bae</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Friday, 5:12 am</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>sos who has the answers to that english assignment and/or can help me Not Fail</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Friday, 5:35 am</p>\n<p align=\"right\">i do! :3</p>\n<p><strong>kiaminari:\u00a0</strong>tenko ur an angel but please, for the love of god, never use that face again</p>\n<p align=\"right\">&gt;:3c</p>\n<p><strong>sero:\u00a0</strong>dude that assignment is due in three hours. its five am.</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>i was distracted by not evil Actual Hero\u2122 midorishi izuku</p>\n<p><strong>sero:\u00a0</strong>he\u2019s been here for like five days the shock has worm off</p>\n<p><strong>ashido:\u00a0</strong>worm</p>\n<p><strong>uraraka:\u00a0</strong>worm</p>\n<p><strong>kirishima:\u00a0</strong>oh, worm?</p>\n<p><strong>sero:\u00a0</strong>WORN gd making one (1) mistake in this gc is like feeding urself to the sharks</p>\n<p><strong>iida:\u00a0</strong>Present Mic-sensei handed out the assignment two weeks ago.</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>listen my knowledge of english is limited to memes and like five (5) words and im fueled by the ability to ignore every assignment up until two hours before its due</p>\n<p><strong>jiro:\u00a0</strong>how are u passing ur class</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>bold of u to assume im passing any of my classes</p>\n<p><strong>bakugo:\u00a0</strong>literally all of u shut the fuck up u crusty ass walnuts its like six in the god damn fucking morning and most of us are trying to SLEEP so if u don\u2019t zippity zop ur fucking mouth im going to personally come to ur shitty dorm and KILL you</p>\n<p><strong>kaminari:\u00a0</strong>bakubro the assignment is due in three hours honestly u could murder me at this point and i would say thank u</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Friday was the first time Tenko approached him alone since UA\u2019s classes had started back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be a rescue hero,\u201d Tenko said, backpack slung over his shoulders. He stared at Izuku with fiery determination. They were alone in the dorm lobby, everyone else either in their dorm rooms or out and about on a Friday evening. \u201cMy quirk is dangerous. My worst fear is using it on someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku thought back to when he first started UA, when his quirk was uncontrollable. He would either break himself or break someone else. The ability to have that sort of crazy power was a lot to bear. He remembered seeing USJ for the first time. Remembered meeting Thirteen. The words that they gave to his class.</p>\n<p>Izuku did what he had to. He got better, got stronger, and learned control.</p>\n<p>Izuku absentmindedly rubbed his right arm\u2014the very place Shigaraki touched him in their last battle. The skin grafts ran from his elbow down to his wrist, raised and scarred. Serving as a constant reminder.</p>\n<p>Tenko was not Shigaraki. Izuku knew that from the moment he looked at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cMy power is not something I ever took lightly,\u201d Izuku said. He leaned against one of the dorm walls. Tenko watched him. \u201cThirteen once said that it takes one wrong move with an uncontrollable quirk for people to die but\u2026.our powers are not <em>meant\u00a0</em>to inflict harm.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked at Tenko, gaze landing on the gloves that he always wore for a little too long. A destructive power did not mean a destructive <em>person</em>.</p>\n<p>Izuku continued, \u201cI, personally, think it\u2019s not about the quirk, but the person that wields it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko laughed but it sounded wet. He rubbed his eyes. Izuku had never been one to judge someone else\u2019s tears. \u201cI like you better than our version.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku saw Tenko for who he really is; Shimura Tenko, hero in training. Someone that would <em>save </em>people in the future. A hero.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been getting at a lot lately. I like you better than my version too,\u201d Izuku doesn\u2019t bother to hide his smile. He can\u2019t help but add on, \u201cThough, you\u2019re missing a couple of hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenko looked down at his two perfectly good hands. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku patted his shoulder and started walking off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s better this way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cW-wait! What do you mean I\u2019m\u00a0<em>missing\u00a0</em>a couple of hands?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tracking down the witness was easy.</p>\n<p>They knew very little about him but they <em>did\u00a0</em>know that his name is Yokota Yoshiki and his quirk was <em>light, </em>which basically meant that he was a walking flashlight. He watched his wife and son disappear. He\u2019d been placed in witness protection for the last six years and was only recently released. He currently lived Tohoku, Japan which was just a little over an hour away from Musutafu.</p>\n<p>Shouto shared a look with Ochako as they looked at the house that loomed above them. Out in the country side of Tohoku, the place didn\u2019t look like anything special. It was hunkered away behind the rolling hills with a field stretched out behind it. The house itself was dark but it was clearly managed.</p>\n<p>Shouto walked up and knocked on the door without hesitation. There was a crash immediately from inside the house followed by the pounding of footsteps. The door was yanked open and a small man stood in the doorway.</p>\n<p>He was old, covered in scars. He smelled like cigarette smoke and whiskey. His wrinkles were so obvious that they dropped down over his eyes. His long, white hair was brained down his back. His eyes were glaring and there was a scowl on his face but the moment he saw Shouto and Ochako on his front porch, it changed to horrified surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Shouto said.</p>\n<p>The man tried to slam the door on his face.</p>\n<p>Uraraka stuck her foot in it before he could. She smiled, but there was an edge to it. \u201cYokota Yoshiki, my name is Uravity. This is Shouto. We\u2019re heroes. We\u2019d like to ask a few questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY-you,\u201d the man sputtered.</p>\n<p>It was like he tried to sound angry, but couldn\u2019t help his fear. He hesitated, but opened the door and let them inside. It wasn\u2019t like he could exactly say <em>no </em>to the number three and number ten hero in the country.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ochako chirped with a smile.</p>\n<p>The man stared at her with dread.</p>\n<p>He lead them into the living room. The shutters were pulled closed, leaving he room dark. While the outside of the house had been maintained, the same could not be said for the inside. Tables and chairs were flipped on their side. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls. There looked like there was a gunshot hole on the kitchen counter. Shouto took a seat on one of the moth-eaten couches. Ochako chose to stand and leaned against the wall next to him. Yokota watched them warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Yokota\u2019s voice sounded rough.</p>\n<p>\u201cEleven days ago, number one hero Deku disappeared.\u201d Shouto said, keeping a straight face. \u201cHe disappeared in a gold and green light. The only thing we have is a cold case about a man who could make people disappear. You\u2019re the only witness. We want you to tell us <em>exactly </em>what happened to you. Any details about this man that you could provide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told the police,\u201d Yokota said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d appreciate if you could tell us too. This is a big case, as you can imagine,\u201d Shouto said evenly.</p>\n<p>Yokota flinched so hard he almost fell off his seat. He wrung his hands together and looked anywhere but where Shouto and Ochako sat. \u201cI-it was ten years ago. My son had gotten involved in some really nasty stuff. Drug rings, Yakuza, the like. He made a deal with a man and it went sour. That man invaded our home later that night. He was huge but covered his face. I couldn\u2019t see more than his outline. H-he made his hands glow and suddenly my wife was gone. M-my son tried to fight him off, but the man did the same thing. I-I ran for my life. I-I don\u2019t know who he was, I don\u2019t know why he came after us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yokota nervously scanned the building. From the way his hands twisted, from the way he looked like he wanted to be anywhere but here. Shouto had dealt with a lot of villains in his lifetime and while he was not Naomasa, he knew when someone was lying.</p>\n<p>And he knew Yokota wasn\u2019t telling the full truth.</p>\n<p>Ochako caught it too. She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cThat not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is! I swear, it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouto stood up from his seat. Izuku had been missing for eleven days. Eleven days and they still didn\u2019t know if he was alive. He tried to control his expression but couldn\u2019t help as he leaned dangerously forward, scowl on his face. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. <em>Tell us the truth</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been telling the truth for the last ten years!\u201d Yokota snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wife and son didn\u2019t disappear because of your son, did they? <em>You\u00a0</em>did something. <em>You </em>know something that you failed to tell anyone else,\u201d Ochako said. \u201cWhat <em>really </em>happened to your family, Yokota Yoshiki?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man broke down in tears, waving his arms around frantically. \u201cIt was me! I\u2019d gotten involved in the Yakuza! I caused them to disappeared! I\u2019m so sorry, God, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. Just leave me alone please, just\u2014\"</p>\n<p>Ochako slammed one of her boots on the floor and smiled dangerously. \u201cDo you know what he did to his victims?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no! I don\u2019t! I\u2019ve said enough if he found out\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is this man now?\u201d Shouto asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>There is was again\u2014the nervous ticks, the glance in the other direction. That was a lie.</p>\n<p>Ochako leaned forward. Shouto suddenly was reminded exactly why she was one of the few people from Class 1-A that Bakugo respected. Shouto had forgotten how terrifying she could be when she put her mind to it. The look on her face was downright <em>deadly</em>. \u201cI think you do. <em>Where. Is. He</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>They walked out of the house not ten minutes later, a location clutched firmly in Ochako\u2019s hand. \u00a0</p>\n<p>(Afterwards, Shouto promptly called Naomasa and informed him of the entire situation. Their witness was not as innocent as they had previously thought.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku walked into one of UA\u2019s gyms, hero costume on and bag in hand.</p>\n<p>It was seven-thirty in the morning on a Saturday, so Izuku knew for a fact that most of the students wouldn\u2019t be up. Besides, Izuku had reserved the gym especially for him and Mirio. No one else currently had access to it.</p>\n<p>To a surprise of absolutely no one, Mirio was already there, warming up. He was also in his hero costume complete with cape and everything. Izuku couldn\u2019t help the smile on his face when he saw it. After what they dealt with during Izuku\u2019s internship\u2026.it was good to have Mirio back.</p>\n<p>Mirio spotted him the moment he walked through the doors. He waved enthusiastically. \u201cHey! Hey! Hey! You ready for this?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiled and dumped his bag next to Mirio\u2019s. He joined Mirio in stretching. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>After ten minutes of stretching, Mirio stood up and offered Izuku a hand. Izuku took it and Mirio hoisted him to his feet. Mirio glanced around at the training gym, hand scratching his hair. \u201cSo how do you want to do this? Just a good old fashion spar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Izuku told him. \u201cI let Aizawa know that we were probably going to be sparring. Nedzu knows as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mirio laughed. \u201cThe principal is probably watching us right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Izuku agreed because he would be more surprised if Nedzu <em>wasn\u2019t </em>watching them in some way. \u00a0He walked to the sparring field\u2014mostly covered in dirt and rocks. Mirio walked to the other end just as Izuku readied his fists. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs always,\u201d Mirio told him happily.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Go</em>!\u201d Izuku shouted and Mirio disappeared not a moment later. Izuku activated One for All without hesitation. Permeation was a powerful ability, but hard to control. If anyone could harness that and One for All, it would be Mirio.</p>\n<p>Izuku stood still, waiting. Any second now\u2026</p>\n<p>Mirio shot out of the ground like a rocket, faster than Izuku could have dodged. If he hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the angle that Mirio ended the ground, he would have been sent sprawling. Mirio landed not ten feet away, glowing in a bright, warm light. He sent a blast of compressed air the moment he touched the ground. Izuku barley had enough time to counter with his own.</p>\n<p>So <em>that </em>was the power of Mirio\u2019s One for All.</p>\n<p>Mirio rushed at him, arm drawn. There were glowing red lines that wrapped around his arm, much like what happened to Izuku when he first started using One for All before Full Cowl. The punch that Mirio sent his way was strong enough that Izuku had to fight not to lose his footing. It uprooted the ground behind him sending dust covering the entire gym.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that Izuku noticed something: Mirio fought like All Might.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s arm throbbed painfully after enduring Mirio\u2019s punch. Without giving Mirio time to throw another one, Izuku slammed a foot into Mirio\u2019s side to send him catering to the side. Mirio disappeared through the floor before Izuku could follow up.</p>\n<p>The fight lasted for some time. They traded blows, learning each other\u2019s moves and skill. Izuku had the advantage of both knowledge of One for All and experience over Mirio, but Mirio got by on raw power and skill alone. There was a <em>reason </em>that Mirio was part of the Big Three during Izuku\u2019s first year of UA. Mirio was a strong, smart and capable fighter. Using One for All just made him better.</p>\n<p>Yet, Izuku could still see some flaws; Mirio treated Permeation and One for All like separate quirks. He didn\u2019t use them at the same time and when it did, it was only to give the other quirk a boost. None of his moves were an equal combination of the two quirks.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Izuku got lucky, being quirkless before One for All.</p>\n<p>Mirio flagged for a time out and Izuku immediately dropped One for All. He walked over to his bag, fishing out his water bottle. He was sore and covered in bruises and cuts, but he hadn\u2019t broken a single bone. Had he still been a first year at UA, Recovery Girl would have been proud.</p>\n<p>Mirio slapped him on the back so hard he went stumbling. \u201cYou\u2019re good with your quirk!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku said and laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always like that. I used to shatter every bone in my body.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026what?\u201d Mirio said incredulously.</p>\n<p>Izuku stared at Mirio. All Might once said that he never dealt with the problems that Izuku had, but for Mirio to also not go through that\u2026 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could always control One for All to some extent,\u201d Mirio said.</p>\n<p>Izuku tried not to be jealous because was he really the <em>only </em>user who struggled with control?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took me three years before I could use it at a hundred percent without shattering every bone in my body,\u201d Izuku said and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p><em>Why\u00a0</em>was he surrounded by people who could naturally use a two hundred year old power like it was nothing?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mirio whistled. \u201cThat sounds rough. I don\u2019t use One for All as much as I\u2019d like. People start getting suspicious when I use them separately, y\u2019know? Because they\u2019re so different and I only got One for All during my first year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hummed in agreement. The two lapse into silence, trying to recover from the last spar. Izuku thought of his Mirio. His natural, happy disposition and his ability to put people at ease. Why Sir liked him so much, why he would\u2019ve been a great hero. Not for the first time, Izuku wondered what would\u2019ve happened if his Mirio got One for All instead.</p>\n<p>Izuku didn\u2019t think it would\u2019ve been a bad decision.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good user, Mirio,\u201d Izuku said instead.</p>\n<p>Mirio laughed out a thank you and said, in all sincerity, \u201cYou are too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His name was Yasutake Takanori. His quirk was called <em>Universe</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s an ominous quirk name,\u201d Ochako commented as they walked down the dark streets of Hoshiko, a city two hours east of Tohoku.</p>\n<p>They were only minutes from the address that Yokota had <em>graciously\u00a0</em>provided. Shouto thought it would\u2019ve been smart for a witness in witness protection to be further away from the person he was being protected <em>from</em>, but their witness was not the smartest nor most innocent of men anyways.</p>\n<p>They were even able to convince him to give them a description: over eight feet talk, broad shoulders, wore nothing but trench coats, no hair and had a scar that ran down the length of the left side of his face. He had silver eyes. According to Yokota, he was quick to anger and very, <em>very </em>dangerous.</p>\n<p>It was a good thing that Shouto was <em>not </em>in a good mood. He could be damn dangerous if he wanted, too.</p>\n<p>Ochako had thrown a dirty hoodie and sweatpants over her hero costume. She left her helmet in the car and threw her hair into a messy ponytail. Shouto had taken off his costume entirely, opting to instead wear a hoodie and facemask to cover his hair and scar. He kept his belt with his first aid supplies and other assorted items hidden under his clothes.</p>\n<p>It would do no good to look like a hero here.</p>\n<p>A tracking device hooked up to a local police station was on Shouto\u2019s left hand. The police were waiting for their signal. They had the entire area surrounded. It was just up to Ochako and Shouto to flush them all out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?!\u201d A voice shouted from behind them.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a man in the alleyway, sparks menacingly coming from his fingers. An electric type quirk. That was fine, they could deal with that.</p>\n<p>Shouto caught Ochako\u2019s eye. Ochako winked, then pretended to cower, holding her hands up. \u201cO-oh! We\u2019re just travelers. I think we\u2019re a little lost. We didn\u2019t mean to bother you or anything uh, we\u2019ll just be on our way\u2014\"</p>\n<p>A hand grabbed Ochako\u2019s arm and yanked her backward. Shouto felt a knife pressed at the back of his neck. Three men surrounded them, faces covered by ski masks.</p>\n<p>The one behind Shouto laughed. \u201cNot so fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake them to the boss,\u201d the first man with the electrical quirk said. Ochako pretended to cry out in alarm and offered a weak resistance to get free. The man holding her shook her harshly while the other two laughed. They dragged them down the alleyway.</p>\n<p>This plan was working out way too well.</p>\n<p>The men lead them through the twists and runs of the darkened alley until they arrived at a green door. It was hidden behind a dumpster with paint flaking off the sides and rust covering the door handle. The villains didn\u2019t hesitate to open the door and throw them all in.</p>\n<p>The inside was completely different. It was covered in lush silks. Two black couches were on the side of the room, a bed on the other. There were people, at least ten, who ran around the room only to stop when they noticed the newcomers. A few backed up towards the bed. Whispering broke out throughout the entire room.</p>\n<p>Shouto and Ochako were thrown to the ground on their knees in front of a man. Shouto tried to look up at his face, but a hand at his neck forced him to look at the man\u2019s shoes. A. Testoni black leather dress shoes. A luxury brand, known to be hand crafted and expensive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His father also liked the brand. That only made Shouto more annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you doing sneaking around our territory?\u201d The man in front of his asked, voice deep and rumbling. Shouto didn\u2019t say anything. The man nudged him with his shoes. Shouto had half a mind to spit on them. \u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking for someone,\u201d Shouto said instead because he didn\u2019t think spitting on the man\u2019s shoes was going to get him to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell were you looking for, boy?\u201d the man said. A few of his cronies laugh.</p>\n<p>Ochako snorted beside him but tried to turn it into a terrified squeak.</p>\n<p>A hand yanked Shouto higher to his knees. Another hand rested at the base of his neck. Two pairs of footsteps could be hear behind him, getting closer and closer until Shouto felt his hoodie being yanked off. Shouto looked up at the man that sat in front of him.</p>\n<p>All he saw were <em>sliver eyes\u00a0</em>and Shouto promptly froze everyone to the floor. As an extra measure, he completely encapsulated their boss with the <em>silver eyes</em>\u2014 Yasutake Takanori, the very many they\u2019d been looking for\u2014entirely in ice. Shouts of surprise came from the men as they struggled to get free. Shouto stood up, helping Ochako to her feet. She yanked down her hoodie with a dangerous smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Shouto said simply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cY-you\u2019re Todoroki Shouto, number three hero,\u201d a man behind him whimpered.</p>\n<p>Shouto didn\u2019t even turn around. \u201cI am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-and Uravity! What the hell are they doing here!?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yasutake struggled to get free, his face set in a fierce glare. He couldn\u2019t even more an inch. He spat at the crony that brought Ochako in here. \u201cWHAT THE HELL DID YOU <em>DO</em>!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know they were heroes!\u201d the man cried out, desperately trying to free his feet. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, boys,\u201d Ochako said. She cracked her knuckles. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s gonna work. We\u2019re going to ask some questions and you\u2019re going to give us answers. Then, we\u2019ll be on our merry way. Got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yasutake nodded hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Where is Deku</em>?\u201d Shouto said, edge to his voice.</p>\n<p>His fire was coming close to igniting. Ice had already spread to cover half of his hoodie. A few of the other people in the room flinched in fear.</p>\n<p>Yasutake didn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYasutake Takanori. Quirk: Universe,\u201d Shouto said. He\u2019s read the case enough times to recite it from memory. \u201cYou were responsible for the disappearances of ten people ten years ago. Exactly twelve days ago, Deku disappeared in a gold and green light. The <em>exact\u00a0</em>light that matches the description of you quirk. So I\u2019m going to ask again; <em>where. is. Deku</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to go after the fucking <em>Symbol of Peace</em>! Are you shitting me?!\u201d The man shouted and struggled even more to break free. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ochako narrowed her eyes and crossed her arms. \u201cNot until you explain your quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the man hesitated, Shouto stepped forward. Fire flickered on his shoulder. Yasutake eyed it warily. \u201cI\u2019ve had a <em>very bad\u00a0</em>two weeks. My best friend is missing. I haven\u2019t slept in three days. A villain attacked our agency four days ago. I\u2019m having to solve this <em>stupid case</em>. I\u2019m having to work with Ground Zero <em>on </em>said case. The first lead we\u2019ve gotten in almost two weeks and it\u2019s <em>you </em>so you better start talking or I\u00a0<em>will </em>make you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Interrogation and threatening have never been Shouto\u2019s strong point but he was tired and <em>done </em>and this was the <em>only thing\u00a0</em>currently standing in the way of getting information about Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d Yasutake stared to say. Shouto cut him off with a sharp piece of ice landing inches from his face. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really hard, was it?\u201d Ochako said with a smile. \u201cNow, about your quirk, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are billions of worlds out there,\u201d Yasutake started. He bit his lip but continued, \u201cOur world is connected to one in particular. I don\u2019t know why. This world is parallel to ours\u2014things often happen in similar ways. The same people with the same quirks. I can send people there. But it wasn\u2019t me that used <em>Universe\u00a0</em>on Deku. That means my alternate self-used it. I <em>don\u2019t know\u00a0</em>why he used it to steal the <em>Symbol of Peace</em>! I hadn\u2019t heard from him in a while. The last thing I heard was the he was in some deep shit with a man named <em>Sensei</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was a lot to unpack, but looking at the man, Shouto heard nothing but the truth. Truthfully, it sounded almost impossible, but if there was a chance that Izuku was there, still alive, then it was a chance that Shouto would take.</p>\n<p>Besides\u2026.the name Sensei was eerily familiar. There was only a single man who dared go by that name. Shouto shared a glance at Ochako who seemed to some to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n<em>All for One. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Ochako turned back to Yasutake. \u201cGive us an idea on why you\u2019re alternate-self would use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know!\u201d the man shouted. Shouto narrowed his eyes because the man was <em>lying. </em>The fire on Shouto\u2019s shoulder roared to life. Ochako stepped forward menacingly. Yasutake immediately backtracked, leaning as far away from the two as he could in his icy prison. \u201cO-okay! Okay! Deku is a villain in their world! I never told other-me that he\u2019s a hero here! But I really don\u2019t know why he would steal Deku!\u201d</p>\n<p>A villain\u2026Deku as a villain. It was almost ridiculous to think about, but if the man was telling the truth and All for One was involved\u2026 Ochako stared wide-eyed at him and mouthed <em>All for One. </em>Shouto wished that he didn\u2019t agree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d Ochako said, quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yasutake asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour alternate-self. It\u2019s not him that took Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouto pressed the tracking device wrapped around his wrist. It immediately alerted to police to the signal. Within moments, this place would be swarmed with officers and taken down. Ochako walked behind the giant ice-cube of a man and placed five fingers on the cube. It started floating immediately and Ochako pushed him towards the door. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Yasutake flailed his head wildly. \u201cH-hey! Where are we going?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a villain. We\u2019re heroes. Where do you think?\u201d Ochako told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo-no! Let me go! I don\u2019t want to go to jail!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about that before being a villain!\u201d Ochako said happily, practically skipping while tugging the man along.</p>\n<p><em>The stress of the past few weeks was finally catching up to him,\u00a0</em>Shouto thought as he watched Ochako head towards the police, her floating ice-man in tow. Yet, now they knew where he was. He knew why he was there. He still worried about Izuku being with All for One and likely his villain alternate-self, but Shouto knew Izuku. Izuku was strong.</p>\n<p>If anyone were to survive a world like it, it would be him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi leaned against the bar, carefully picking through Midorishi Izuku\u2019s scattered papers.</p>\n<p>Most were illegible, written on napkins. A few were crunched up into balls and thrown on the floor. They all consisted of an assortment of words and numbers. Diagrams were messily scratched onto a few. Dabi was pretty sure he saw a crude drawing of a nomu. Ever since All for One showed his ugly mug, Midorishi had been obsessed with <em>whatever\u00a0</em>he was doing. Threw himself into his words and never left.</p>\n<p>Dabi didn\u2019t want to know what that was, but felt like he already knew. Midorishi was coming up with a plan.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Midorishi, he was still scribbling away, never once looking up. He was muttering things\u2014<em>stupid hero, heroes, universe</em>\u2014so it wasn\u2019t hard to guess what was on his mind. Kurogiri was watching him with exasperation. The rest of the league stayed far, far away considering Midorishi had thrown Spinner through the wall not two days ago for accidentally throwing away one of the pieces written on a napkin. Fifteen years old and terrifyingly strong.</p>\n<p>Good thing Dabi didn\u2019t particularly care. He was only here because Midorishi was the only thing that could alleviate his boredom.</p>\n<p>Midorishi suddenly crowed in delight, holding one of the many pieces of paper like it was a nugget of gold. \u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dabi couldn\u2019t read the words on the paper. He raised an unimpressed eyebrow. \u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA plan,\u201d Midorishi said.</p>\n<p>He gathered his piles of papers and shoved them into the trash. Spinner stared, dumbstruck. Toga laughed. Kurogiri signed. Without another word, Midorishi walked towards the door with a wicked and terrifying grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dabi called, leaning against the bar. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorishi grinned at him, eyes wide. There was blood on the side of his face. \u201cTo deliver a <em>message</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a Sunday afternoon\u2014almost two weeks since Izuku had been here\u2014when everything went to hell.</p>\n<p>The dorm was bustling with activity, everyone rushing around to either complete their homework, play video games or catch up with friends. Tenko was currently murdering everyone at Mario Kart. Todoroki had been avoiding Izuku ever since\u00a0he last spoke to him. Iida lead a five-person study group to figure out Present Mic\u2019s newest assignment. Kaminari had tried to rope Izuku into helping them, but Izuku only took a sip of his drink and gave him a cheeky smile. He'd done his time during school and wasn't too keen on going back.</p>\n<p>It was strangely nostalgic, being in the dorms again.</p>\n<p>Yaomomo approached him not five minutes later while Izuku was watching as Tenko won his fifth Mario Kart game. Kacchan threw his controller at Tenko\u2019s head and Uraraka had to hold Tenko back from lunging. Kirishima did the same to Kacchan.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning on doing a class trip to the mall. We have a few ingredients that we need for the next week if we\u2019re going to cook,\u201d Yaomomo said. Their conversation drew a few people over, probably wondering just what they were talking about. The Mario Kart game was put on hold (which was probably for the best anyways). \u201cWant to come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not part of the class?\u201d Izuku said slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you stay here often enough that we figured you would be lonely if we all left,\u201d Yaomomo said which was <em>true</em>, but she didn't need to say it. \u201cIt would be rude not to invite you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides, it\u2019s better to have a hero with us if villains attack,\u201d Sero said.</p>\n<p>At least he was honest, but that was<em> not</em> the most comforting thing to say. Especially knowing Class 1-A's luck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026do not have the best experiences at the mall,\u201d Izuku said sheepishly, remembering the last couple of times his mall trips had ended up sour. Shigaraki and the League had never made mall trips fun for him.</p>\n<p>Tenko laughed in agreement, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cI understand how you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He probably does</em>, Izuku thought and shuddered to think of what his counterpart did. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku went to the mall. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, he was no match for the combined persuasive power of 1-A. Sero\u2019s point also rang true\u2014if anyone wanted to start trouble, they would have to go through<em> him </em>first.</p>\n<p>At first, the mall was great. Even though Izuku ended up having to cover all of his face to prevent being confused for his nasty villain counterpart, he was glad to be out of UA. He hadn\u2019t been able to leave in almost a week, with the other week spent in a police station.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mall was familiar and fun, the shops bright and colorful. It was a welcomed distraction to Izuku\u2019s current situation. If he stopped for a moment, he could almost\u00a0pretend that this was his world, with his friends and his home. Then, one of his much-to-young classmates would walk in front of him (or he's glance at Tenko) and the image would be ruined. He tried not to feel bitter about it, he really did, but the rock in his stomach only grew heavier as time went on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first hour, nothing remarkable happened. The class stuck together as they migrated from shop to shop, teasing and laughing. A couple people recognized them from the Sports Festival and asked for autographs. Izuku made himself scarce when that happened. Jiro ended up buying a kazoo on a dare. Uraraka bought some limited edition Thirteen merchandise (Izuku wished he could buy some too, but he didn\u2019t have money and would\u2019ve felt guilty asking. That didn\u2019t stop him from staring enviously at Uraraka). Iida ended up dragging half the class into a sports\u2019 wear store, and coming out with a variety of new shoes, leggings and training gear. All in all, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p>\n<p>Izuku should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t last.</p>\n<p>It was Shoji who spotted him first and quickly alerted everyone else. Soon, the horde of first year UA students were chattering nervously as they stared at the other side of the mall because there, leaning up against a wall, was Midorishi Izuku.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, that's not good,\" Tenko said in an almost breathless whisper.</p>\n<p>Izuku thought that was probably the understatement of the century.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To most people, he would be invisible\u2014his spot was strategically picked so that the majority of people wouldn\u2019t even be able to see his shadow. He wore nothing to hide his face. Midorishi kept his eyes firmly on the civilians in front of him, watching as each one passed. There was a knife strapped to his side. His face was so, so similar to Izuku\u2019s own. He\u2019d seen him once before during Kamino, but it was nothing like this.</p>\n<p>A scar ran down the length of Midorishi's face. Unlike Izuku's poofy, curly hair, his was cut shorter. His clothes were dark but so obviously stuffed to the brim with an assortment of weaponry. His eyes were just as green, but there was nothing there\u2014they were the same eyes Izuku looked at when he saw Shigaraki Tomura. Dead, empty, gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why was he here? From what Izuku had heard about his counterpart, he was smart. He wouldn\u2019t take risks at random. For him to come to a crowded mall of all places\u2014it meant he wanted something.</p>\n<p>There was a pit starting to form in Izuku\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call the heroes,\u201d Iida said and immediately pulled out his phone.</p>\n<p>It only took three rings before Midorishi slowly turned his head, like something out of a horror movie, and met Izuku\u2019s own. There was a sadistic grin on his face. A little splotch of dried blood stood out on his right temple.</p>\n<p>\u201cRun,\u201d Izuku said because he<em> knew</em> that look. That was the look of someone who had a plan. 1-A hesitated, staring at him with wide eyes. Aizawa had just answered Iida\u2019s call. Izuku turned to them, snapping, \u201c<em>Run now!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Just as they were about to listen, a black mist appeared behind their feet. It crawled up their bodies and engulfing them in a matter of seconds. People in the mall were starting to scream and panic. Izuku desperately lunged to try to grab someone\u2014anyone\u2014but they all slipped through his fingers and disappeared into the warp gate.</p>\n<p>The black mist enveloped him and he had just enough time to think <em>oh fuck</em>, before he\u00a0was falling.</p>\n<p>Izuku hit the steel ground hard enough for the <em>clang</em> to echo around. The impact knocked the wind out of him and white hot pain burst through his temple but Izuku didn\u2019t have time to worry about that. Years of engraved hero instincts took over as he shook his head and flipped to his feet, surveying his position.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was in an empty warehouse-like place. The little light in there came from three broken windows that were near the top of the high ceilings. There were no doors or easy escape hatches that Izuku could see from where he was. A catwalk hung from the ceiling and various wooden boxes littered the room.\u00a0It looked like it hadn\u2019t been used in a long time.\u00a0Around him, the rest of 1-A lay, groaning but alive. Their bags of newly bought items were scattered\u00a0and broken, but it wasn't the time to worry about that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku rushed over and grabbed the nearest student, Tenko, to his feet. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"What the <em>fuck</em>,\" Kirishima groaned into the floor.</p>\n<p>Beside him, Kacchan was already on his feet. Most of the rest of the class hadn't moved, save a few like Todoroki and Momo who were already looking around for escape routes. That was good\u2014they needed all the help they could get at this point.</p>\n<p>There was a mixed set of replies but luckily no one seemed injured enough that they wouldn\u2019t be able to move or fight. Izuku had a very bad feeling that Midorishi wasn\u2019t quite done with them all yet.</p>\n<p>His feeling was proven true when the black mist\u2014Kurogiri, <em>of course,</em> who else would it be?\u2014appeared. Midorishi himself stepped through the portal with a grin.</p>\n<p>\"Hi,\" Midorishi said. \"Welcome to the party. Glad you all could come. Hope you don't mind, but I invited a few other guests.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>A screech sounded from inside the portal and a horrible feeling pooled in Izuku\u2019s stomach. The sound rattled in his brain and Izuku fought to not cover his ears. Although he hadn't heard anything like that in years, those screeches were ones that he could never forget. A large, clawed black hand reached out as the creature crawled its way out of the swirling black portal. Its entire body was covered in an array of scars, its brain clearly on display for everyone to see. Its beak curved at the end and it carried a set of razor sharp teeth. It stood up, towering over everyone gathered in the warehouse and stumbled over to stand behind Midorishi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Four more Nomu crawled out in the same way.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was <em>it</em>. Izuku was never visiting another mall in his <em>life</em>.</p>\n<p>The black portal finally took a familiar shape. Kurogiri\u2019s golden eyes glowered at them all as the villain tugged at his suit. Izuku hadn\u2019t seen Kurogiri since he was put in Tartarus and he didn\u2019t partially want to become acquainted again so soon. Midorishi grinned and waved like this was a high school reunion.</p>\n<p>Beside Izuku, Tenko took a frightened step back. Kacchan had tiny explosions coming from his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cSo, Kurogiri, you're uninvited now. Thanks for the drop off,\u201d Midorishi said, not once taking his eyes off of the group of UA students.</p>\n<p>Izuku felt One for All rattle beneath his skin but he waited\u2014he had to plan this right. He couldn\u2019t fight recklessly.</p>\n<p>Kurogiri hesitated for a moment, looking at Midorishi incredulously. Midorishi spun on his heel, his smile fading and snapped, \u201cDidn\u2019t you<em> hear me</em>? <em>Leave</em>. I don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"If this is how you want to play this game, then so be it,\" Kurogiri said. \"Dinner is at seven. Sensei still wants to meet you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. This won't take long anyways,\" Midorishi said, uninterested. The Nomu stayed stock-still behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku tensed up, expecting a trap but Kurogiri was gone not a second later. Midorishi cracked his knuckles and laughed. Izuku tried not to cringe as the sound echoed across the empty warehouse.</p>\n<p>Midorishi met Izuku\u2019s eyes. \u201cGlad you could join me! You\u2019ve really been a real <em>pain</em> in our sides lately, y\u2019know? So I figured, since it was my idea to send you here, I might as well kill you, right? Big ole <em>fuck you</em> to your world. What kinda world would it be without the League anyways? Maybe send a message to All Might as well. Class full of dead kids <em>isn\u2019t</em> a fantastic morale booster, in my opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorishi stepped forward, taking the knife from his hip and spinning it around in his fingers. He had this wild and crazy grin on his face, but Izuku knew that Midorishi was not a stupid person. He was young and rash but he was smart. Izuku knew that better than anyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This wouldn't be an easy fight. Not with the Nomu and a class to protect.</p>\n<p>\"Nomu,\" Midorishi said. The creatures tensed at their name. \"Kill them.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>We don\u2019t really know whether to validate this hero license or not. For now, it would be better to just avoid conflict. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em>Sorry, Naomasa-san,</em> Izuku thought as he powered up One for All.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took\u00a0the combined force of the police and heroes almost a day to set up. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Bringing Yasutake Takanori had been the easy part. The not-so easy part was convincing him to send a small group of heroes into the other world <em>and</em> bring them back. It was true that he had the control, but it was the trust issue that most everyone was worried about.\u00a0Bringing everyone back safely would be the most important part. How were you supposed to trust a villain?</p>\n<p>That, thankfully, fell on Naomasa\u2019s shoulders. Shouto had done his fair share of threatening. He didn\u2019t particularly want to do any more.</p>\n<p>In the end, Naomasa managed to do it. Shouto wasn\u2019t sure how, didn\u2019t partially care, but he was thankful. They were <em>so close</em> to getting Izuku back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The plan is simple; send himself, Ochako and Bakugo (who stubbornly insisted that he was <em>not going to be left out</em>) to the parallel world. Find Izuku before the two hours is up. In order to send him back, since Yasutake was not the one who sent him there in the first place, one of the three there was sent there <em>had </em>to be touching Izuku. If they didn\u2019t find him in enough time or didn't touch him as Yasutake warped them back, Izuku would stay in the alternate world.</p>\n<p>Shouto watched as Naomasa made the final preparations. His hero suit felt strangely heavy. Ochako stood beside him, also ready to go. Bakugo had been watching the entire setup since Shouto and Ochako had first brought the villain in. The rest of their class, having come for support, gathered around the three.</p>\n<p>Naomasa poked his head in the room. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Bakugo said. He was the first to follow Naomasa into the next room.</p>\n<p>Shouto and Ochako shared a look before Ochako shook her head in exasperation. Behind her, Kirishima laughed.\u00a0Ashido\u00a0shook her head in exasperation, but followed him out. The rest of the ex-class was not too far behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Why is Bakugo coming again?\" Shouto\u00a0muttered to\u00a0Ochako.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Because I didn't feel like arguing for hours,\" Ochako said, which, admittedly, was fair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room Naomasa lead them too was <em>white</em>. It almost looked like a lab out of a scifi movie\u2014if labs normally had villains chained to the center of the room. The walls almost sparkled, pristine, as Yasutake glared at them from the center of the room with as much fury as he could muster. Bakugo glared back with even more force.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have two hours. Two hours until we bring you back,\u201d Naomasa said. \u201cYasutake-san said that he could get you close to where Izuku is. You\u2019ll have to find him from there. Remember\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of us has to touch the fucking nerd,\u201d Bakugo snapped. \u201cWe got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Naomasa said, not at all off-put but Bakugo\u2019s attitude. He\u2019d probably dealt with enough weird or frustrating situations not to be put off by it. Not to mention, he\u2019s been supporting class 1-A since they were first years. \u201cWe don\u2019t know much about this world. We do know that it\u2019s parallel. We know that Midoriya\u2019s counterpart is a villain and is working under their All for One. Be sure to be careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Yaomomo said. Ochako gave her a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Midoriya that he needs to stop getting involved in this kinda stuff, man,\u201d Kaminari said and laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been like this since the start,\u201d Jiro said and she rolled her eyes. \u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be stopping any time soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does really get involved into the strangest things, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Ojiro laughed, rubbing the back of his head.</p>\n<p>Tenya approached them. Shouto knew how badly he wanted to go as well, how much it hurt him having to stay behind. He was one of Izuku\u2019s first friends and one of the one\u2019s that Izuku trusted completely. However, someone had to say behind and look after the agency, especially if something went wrong. They couldn\u2019t afford for all of them to go. Not when this world still needed them, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay safe,\u201d Tenya said as he swept both Shouto and Ochako into a hug. \"And bring him home.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t be coming back until I do,\u201d Shouto promised.</p>\n<p>He met Tenya\u2019s eyes and could only hope that Tenya could see the fierce determination that he felt. He would <em>not</em> stop until Izuku was home, safe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry about us,\" Ochako said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenya nodded and stepped back.</p>\n<p>\u201cSend us to Deku,\u201d Ochako told Yasutake.</p>\n<p>He looked like he was about to spit at her feet but one look from Naomasa had him freeze. Instead, the villain huffed and held out his hands. The tips of his fingers sparkled until a brilliant light weaved its way in an intricate pattern down his entire hand. Gold and green light swirled around, steadily getting brighter and brighter. The very same light that had send Izuku away two weeks ago. The pattern snaked its way from Yasutake to the floor and then crawled its way up Shouto's entire body. It tingled just for a second before fading entirely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shouto was about to ask <em>is that it?</em> when the light exploded into a burst of color and blinded him. Shouts of alarm were heard all throughout the room and\u00a0he tried to answer them, but nothing came out of his mouth. All he felt was burning and burning and <em>burning.</em></p>\n<p>Suddenly,\u00a0he knew nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't leave a single one alive,\u201d Midorishi\u00a0said to\u00a0the Nomu.</p>\n<p>The beasts didn\u2019t hesitate to comply, each lumbering forward before launching themselves after the group with incredible speed. Izuku immediately blasted\u00a0three of them away by a well-timed punch using One for All and fought off the other two using his shoot style.</p>\n<p>All the while, Midorishi watched with glee.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet behind me!\u201d Izuku ordered.</p>\n<p>Class 1-A complied, but they were all tense and ready for a fight. They\u2019d done this once at UJS and another time during the summer camp but this\u2026cut off from everyone, targeted specifically to be killed? This was going to get messy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIida, call the heroes!\u201d Uraraka said in panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Iida was aggressively dialing his phone, but just like USJ, nothing was happening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Midorishi said. His voice was almost like a purr. \u201cDon\u2019t think we forgot about our little mishap last time. You won\u2019t be able to reach the heroes here.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was great. <em>Fantastic</em>. This day was just getting better and better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the next five minutes, Izuku did nothing but defend everyone from the Nomu. It wasn\u2019t easy and he took more than a few blows and injuries. These Nomu were much like the one at USJ with their nullification powers. They were specifically designed to counter and nullify One for All. Plus, he couldn\u2019t go all out, not with the 1-A behind him and Midorishi just waiting for an opening. It looked bad, and the battle probably should have been a slaughter but...</p>\n<p>Deku wasn\u2019t the Symbol of Peace for no reason.</p>\n<p>So he defended everyone to the best of his abilities. He blocked attack after attack from the Nomu, sending them sprawling only for them to get back up. They nullified his power but Izuku only produced more. He would stop their attacks for as long as he needed to. Again and again <em>and again</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>There was a flash on his right. Izuku didn\u2019t have enough time to even turn before pain burst through his side and he was thrown off his feet. He flew ten\u00a0yards\u00a0before crashing into a stack of boxes. They shattered on impact, letting the splinters rain down on him. Izuku tried not to groan as he hoisted himself up to his feet. He had to get back to the students\u2014</p>\n<p>Midorishi stood in the way, his left side glowing white. Izuku had no idea what type of quirk that was. Knowing All for One, Midorishi probably had several.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, stop that,\u201d Midorishi said. \u201cI want to see the Nomu kill them. You\u2019re in the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>How could someone like <em>that</em> ever be <em>him</em>?</p>\n<p>The Nomu advanced, this time slowly. Izuku glanced desperately at the class and tried to rush around Midorishi, but he consistently stood in his way. Izuku had no choice but the fight his counterpart if he ever wanted everyone to get out of there alive.</p>\n<p>Midorishi must have seen the change in his expression because he laughed. The glow faded from his arm replaced with red sparks of lightning and looked\u00a0eerily similar to Izuku\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Oh yep, he definitely had more than one quirk. Cool. Great. <em>Fantastic</em>.</p>\n<p>It was fine, he could still do this. He\u2019d beaten All for One. He\u2019d beaten Shigaraki Tomura. He\u2019d stopped the league. If this villainous fifteen year old version of himself wanted to fight then <em>fine, </em>he would give him a damn fight.</p>\n<p>Izuku bared his teeth in a dangerous\u00a0smile and raced to meet Midorishi when he attacked.</p>\n<p>The impact was enough to shake the entire warehouse. The wind was so strong that it almost tipped a Nomu off balance. Behind him, he would hear the class duck for cover even as the Nomu continued to advance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midorishi didn\u2019t give him any time to make sure everyone was alright, sending blast after blast of pure power. He switched quirks so fast that Izuku didn\u2019t have time to learn what they did half the time. His villain version was <em>good. </em>It was obvious that he trained under All for One.</p>\n<p>But Izuku knew All for One. His quirks, his fighting style, his power.</p>\n<p>Izuku glanced behind him only to see a Nomu dangerously close to the class. Bakugo looked ready to launch himself at it, held back only by Kirishima. He paused in his battle, twisting midair to fling a blast in the direction of a nomu. It sent it off balance and into the side of the warehouse. Izuku took a hit from Midorishi but it was worth it if it meant keeping them safe.</p>\n<p>\"You're distracted,\" Midorishi said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Kinda hard not to be,\" Izuku replied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku took another hit. His skidded to a stop a few feet away from the class, breathing heavily. Tenko watched him with horror in his eyes. He was pretty sure Hagakure was crying.</p>\n<p>They were only kids. They weren\u2019t pros\u2014not yet. USJ and the training camp were bad enough. They shouldn\u2019t be in a battle like this yet. They shouldn\u2019t have to experience this.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014We don\u2019t have authorization for combat!\u201d Iida said in a harsh whisper. He seemed to be\u00a0arguing\u00a0with someone in the class but Izuku didn\u2019t dare turn to look. Not with Midorishi and his Nomu slowly advancing. At the rate this battle was going, the ending wasn\u2019t going to be pretty.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what are we going to do, die?!\u201d Jiro snapped right back. Her ear jacks were already plugged into her amplifier.</p>\n<p>Izuku never thought he\u2019d have to use his power on civilians, much less students and people that he considered friends. Now he knew how Aizawa felt when Izuku hd begged him to let them fight during the summer camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs pro hero Deku, I authorize you to use combat to defend yourself and escape!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midorishi and the remaining three Nomu cornered them.</p>\n<p>The other two were in an assortment of disarray. One was so badly burnt from different explosions that it was almost unrecognizable. Its head had been trapped in ice. The other had been attacked by a mixture of ten different quirks. They had both been so beaten that they stumbled to the ground and hadn\u2019t once tried to get up. If anything, that only served to piss Midorishi off more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just die?\u201d Midorishi asked. Izuku only narrowed his eyes. One for All crackled around him dangerously but his arms ached from the forced output from such sheer power. He was the only thing that stood in the way of Midorishi and his Nomu. He wouldn\u2019t let them get to everyone again.</p>\n<p>An explosion rocked the warehouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It came from the back, out of sight from Izuku. He didn't dare look in the direction, eyes firmly on Midorishi. Uraraka squeaked in surprise. Iida tried to shield as many other students as he could despite the lack of debris. They all tensed up, ready for another villain. Midorishi seemed entirely unbothered as he glanced over his shoulder with a glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cNomu,\u201d Midorishi said. The three remaining Nomu stood at attention, waiting for orders. Their huge heads turning to stare unblinkingly at the very man that commanded them. \u201cYou, on the right. Go make sure that wasn\u2019t the heroes. That would be\u2026.unfortunate.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sure hoped it was the heroes. He only let himself be a little relived that Midorishi didn't know what, exactly, that was either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"So! We have time to kill, I guess,\" Midorishi said, leaning casually against the side of one of his Nomu. He met Izuku\u2019s eyes and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy a hero?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy a villain?\u201d Izuku challenged.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m strong,\u201d Midorishi replied, immediately. \u201cYet you call yourself Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone once told me,\u201d Izuku grinned. He thought of Ochako with her words years ago. He thought of how his name evolved into the person that he was today. He was <em>proud</em> to call himself Deku. He was <em>proud </em>of his name. \u201cThat my \u2018Deku\u2019 sounds like <em>you can do it</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt still means useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to my world,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cNot to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was the difference between the two of them. This Midorishi had let the word useless become who he was and everything he did. He tried to escape what he himself had created and, in turn, got lost along the way. Izuku wasn\u2019t like that. His useless meant <em>useful</em>. His power meant <em>hero. </em>He fought for his family, his friends. For all the innocent people that <em>needed</em> him. He wasn\u2019t going to let down his friends. He wouldn\u2019t disappoint everyone who believed in him.</p>\n<p>\"Probably should've expected that. You hero types are always the same. Guess you'll always be a deku,\" Midorishi said.</p>\n<p>His left side exploded in the red lightning. It was <em>definitely</em> some sort of strength enchantment quirk\u2014perhaps something to imitate One for All. Midorishi probably thought of it as a joke, to defeat someone with their own power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midorishi noticed him looking and smiled in a cruel way. \u201cLike it? Sensei gave it to me. Pretty similar to your quirk, isn\u2019t it? I think it\u2019s funny!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku thought he had a pretty terrible sense of humor.</p>\n<p>Midorishi readied his fist. Izuku powered up One for All. He wouldn\u2019t let this man hurt his friend. He wouldn\u2019t let this man kill <em>any </em>of them.</p>\n<p>Just as Midorishi was about the attack, a hand tapped on his shoulder. Midorishi blinked in surprise while the lightning around him crackled out of existence. Confused, Midorishi turned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Todoroki Shouto said and coldcocked the bastard.</p>\n<p>There, standing in a blue and white jumper, was Shouto. An older, more experienced, more <em>familiar </em>Shouto. There was no doubt that this was Izuku\u2019s Shouto\u2014the very same one that he had grew up with, that he had fought with, they he had become best friends with. The one that always seemed to have his back after years and years of fights.</p>\n<p>\"<em>Shouto</em>,\" Izuku breathed. He\u00a0felt like he could cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d Ochako stepped out of the shadows with a smile on her face.</p>\n<p>She, like Shouto, was dressed in her hero costume. The pink and blue colors were a welcomed sight as well as was the Nomu that floated several hundred feet above her, flailing around wildly.</p>\n<p>She met Izuku\u2019s eyes and laughed, loud and relived and happy. Shouto smiled at him and gave a two-fingered wave.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys,\u201d Izuku said and, yeah, he was definitely crying.</p>\n<p>Midorishi stumbled to his feet, eyes wide and crazed. He spat blood onto the ground. His body sparked with power. Shouto barley turned to look at him. Ochako rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>Midorishi stumbled forward with a snarl. \u201cYou\u2026 how did you even get here?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parallel word, you fucking <em>dumbass</em>,\u201d and, for the second time that night, Midorishi was sent to the ground.</p>\n<p>Izuku could honestly say he was surprised when he saw Kacchan\u2014<em>his</em> Kacchan\u2014standing over Midorishi and cracking his knuckles. There was a terrifying grin on his face but Izuku had never been more relived to see it.</p>\n<p>Ochako and Shouto immediately pulled him into a hug. Ochako was crying, but furiously wiped her tears away. Shouto held him like he was going to disappear again.</p>\n<p>\"Deku,\" his Kacchan said \u00a0as a way of greeting.</p>\n<p>\"Kacchan,\" Izuku said back,\u00a0trying to keep his relived laughter at bay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan rolled his eyes and\u00a0almost immediately\u00a0lunged\u00a0at Midorishi when he tried to attack again, a shit-eating grin firmly in place. Explosions sprang from his palm with vengeance.</p>\n<p>From there, the fight was entirely one sided for all the right reasons.</p>\n<p>Midorishi never stood a chance, even with the two reminding Nomu helping him out. Kacchan was a terrifying power when he wanted to be.</p>\n<p><em>But,</em> Izuku thought as he looked at the gleeful expression on Kacchan\u2019s face as he pummeled Midorishi to the ground, <em>he might be enjoying this just a little too much.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I should be mildly terrified,\u201d Izuku said to Shouto as he watched Kacchan blast the shit out of his counterpart.</p>\n<p>Shouto snorted. Behind him, the class (uninjured, thankfully) watched in amazement. Iida helped Tenko to his feet. Tsuyu and Uraraka were supporting each other\u2019s weight. Kaminari was sitting on the floor, watching the fight like he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. The younger Kacchan was watching his counterpart with grudging respect.</p>\n<p>Ashido hesitantly approached, eyeing Ochako and Shouto, as she watched the fight happen in front of them. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you meant when you said that your Bakugo would beat the shit out of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouto and Ochako glanced at her in surprise. It was almost like they hadn\u2019t noticed the <em>entire class </em>that Izuku had been protecting. If he hadn\u2019t been so tired and sore and <em>relived</em>, he probably would have laughed at their expressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Izuku said.</p>\n<p>He was just glad that Kacchan wasn\u2019t after him this time. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve it or not,\u201d Ochako said. \u201cHe used to be worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku remembered those time when Kacchan would ruin his stuff and make his desk explode. All the taunts, all the threats that he received. Ever since Kamino, Kacchan had calmed down considerably. They weren\u2019t what Izuku would call friends\u2014he doubted they\u2019d ever get to that point\u2014but they could work together when needed.\u00a0Rivals was better than enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWay worse,\u201d Izuku agreed.</p>\n<p>Kacchan just blasted Midorishi across the warehouse. One of the remaining two Nomu were missing and Izuku had no doubt that his Kacchan had something to do with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of worse\u2026\u201d Shouto said and both he and Ochako jumped at the chance to scold him as if getting <em>sent to an alternate reality by All for One</em> was somehow <em>his fault</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d Izuku said with a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you had to do,\u201d Shouto said. \"Was walk across the street to a coffee shop. It was two blocks away. But no, instead you got sent <em>here</em> and we had to find you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki was staring at his alternate self like he couldn\u2019t believe that was actually him. Everyone else didn\u2019t seem to know how to approach this new, different Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Ochako grabbed his cheeks and pulled. Izuku tried to swat her away but she had a grip of steel. \u201cI take my eyes off of you for a <em>day</em> and you disappear to an <em>alternate reality</em>. Seriously, why is it always <em>you</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know!\u201d Izuku cried because if someone\u2014godly force or otherwise\u2014was doing this to him then he would like it if they stopped, <em>please</em>.</p>\n<p>Class 1-A watched on in the background. No one was quite sure what to make of the newcomers. Shouto was an intimidating presence but he was softer than his counterpart. Ochako had the confidence of a hero with years under her belt and the experience to match it. Both were nothing like what they were when they first arrived at UA all those years ago.</p>\n<p>The scolding trailed off and Ochako pulled him into another hug. Izuku didn\u2019t hesitate the return it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe missed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you guys, too,\u201d Izuku said and damn, he was not going to cry <em>again. </em>It didn\u2019t stop the bubbling relief in his chest because he would finally be able to go. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. How did you even <em>get</em> here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parallel world, right?\u201d Shouto said. \u201cThat means that there was the same quirk in our world. We just had to find it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cracked a cold case,\u201d Ochako told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we cracked a cold case,\u201d Shouto agreed, trying to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>Izuku was definitely going to ask for more details when he got back home but for now, Izuku was content to watch as Shouto scanned the class. His eyes landed on Tenko.</p>\n<p>Oops. Izuku forgot about that little detail.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako seemed to notice and visibly tensed up. Tenko looked like a deer in headlights. \u201cAn alternate reality, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku liked Tenko. Much more than he liked his counterpart. Tenko was a fun person to be around. He liked to play jokes with his friends, was good at Mario Kart and always offered a helping hand when needed. He tended to shut down when stressed. He snorted juice from his nose when he found things funny.</p>\n<p>Tenko wasn\u2019t Shigaraki. He never would be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHis name is Shimura Tenko,\u201d Izuku said carefully. It wasn\u2019t hard to miss the surprised looks that his friends shot him. \u201cHe wants to be a hero. He\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>That alone wouldn\u2019t convince Ochako and Shouto. It had taken him two weeks\u2014two weeks of getting to know Tenko, of seeing his determination to become a hero. Shouto and Ochako did not have that time. Their untrusting expressions and closed off looks told him so. However, as wary as they were, they no longer looked like they were about to attack any second.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki has left his scars on them, too.</p>\n<p>Another explosion happened behind them. The screech of a Nomu could be heard, echoing through the warehouse. Shouto didn\u2019t bother to look, too focused on examining every single one of the people that Izuku had spent the past week with. Shouto\u2019s eyes fall onto his alternate self for a little too long.</p>\n<p>Izuku knew immediately that Shouto could tell that his alternate self <em>didn\u2019t</em> use his left side. Todoroki could tell that Shouto <em>did</em> use his left side. Izuku couldn\u2019t tell which side was more surprised.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was working on it,\u201d Izuku said, instead, when he caught Shouto\u2019s look.</p>\n<p>Shouto nodded as tilted his head as his younger counterpart glared at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todoroki asked, \"Why?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Someone once told me,\" Shouto said steadily and ignored the looks from the entire class, \"That it was my power. My abilities. Everyone else was giving it their all. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to everyone if I didn\u2019t give a hundred percent, right?\"</p>\n<p>Toodoroki\u2019s eyes flickered over to Izuku. Understanding blossomed there, but Torodoki immediately closed off his expression and said, \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki still had a long way to go. That\u2019s okay, because he had his friends to help him out.</p>\n<p>Uraraka hesitantly approached, looking at Ochako with wide eyes. \u201cWow. This is me as a hero?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure am!\u201d Ochako said proudly. Then, she seemed to realize something and looked up at the Nomu that was still screeching at them a hundred feet above. \u201cSpeaking of\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Ochako pressed her fingers together and the Nomu promptly dropped from the sky. It hit the ground with a <em>thud, </em>not ten feet from where Kacchan and Midorishi were still fighting. Shouto froze it to the ground before it even had the chance to move. It cried out, struggling to escape its icy prison, but not even a Nomu could escape from something like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch it, Round Face!\u201d his Kacchan snapped as he dodged the nomu. He flung Midorishi over his shoulder when the villain tried to take advantage of his distraction. Kacchan then nearly slipped on a piece of ice, cursing all the while. \u201cFucking <em>half and half</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorishi sneered in their direction right before taking an explosion to the face, courtesy of Kacchan. Ochako caught sight of it and whistled, visibly learning back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t get this,\u201d she said. Shouto nodded in agreement. Izuku didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya \u2018<em>I have no self-preservation when it comes to anyone in danger\u2019</em> Izuku,\u201d Shouto said. Izuku nudged his side with a snort but Shouto paid him no mind. \u201cAs a villain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him break his arm to save a cat,\u201d Ochako told 1-A like it was a story that everyone needed to hear.</p>\n<p>Izuku felt his face heat up when several of them, including younger Kacchan and Tenko, turned to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does seem to break his arm over everything,\u201d Shouto agreed which was a load of bullshit because Izuku hadn\u2019t broken his arm in <em>months, thank you very much. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cGuys,\u201d Izuku tried.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t listen. Ochako gave Shouto a weird look. \u201cYeah, but\u2026a cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, it was Hitoshi\u2019s cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHitoshi\u2019s cat hates him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe does.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAre we sure we\u2019re talking about the same person?\u201d Tsuyu asked.</p>\n<p>Ochako smiled at her, but Izuku <em>knew</em> that smile. Nothing good ever came from that smile. Unfortunately for Izuku, Ochako wasn\u2019t the one that he needed to worry about.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d Shouto said. Izuku begged with his eyes for Shouto not to tell any more embarrassing stories, but Shouto didn\u2019t even glance in his direction. \u201cOne time he accidentally made a baby cry and started crying himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tsuyu is so surprised that she laughed. Tenko shot him a look and Izuku tried to hide his face. Todoroki was watching his counterpart like he couldn\u2019t quite believe what he was like. The younger Kacchan snorted. Kaminari\u00a0 and Kirishima laughed so hard that they had to sit on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouto, <em>please</em>,\u201d Izuku begged because his friends were <em>awful. </em>He\u2019d rather be beaten up by his alternate self than listen to Ochako and Shouto drag his good name through the mud.</p>\n<p>But, as much as Izuku was embarrassed, he couldn\u2019t help but thank his friends silently.</p>\n<p>Shouto and Ochako were heroes. <em>Very</em> good heroes. They\u2019d gone through hero training, they\u2019d been in countless situations. They dedicated their lives to keeping people safe and calm, which was exactly what they were doing there. Keeping Everyone\u2019s mind off of Midorishi Izuku and the attack that he had just tried to make. They knew what they were doing. Kacchan had the fighting part down. They just had to keep everyone from panicking until another hero (one from UA, Izuku hoped) arrived on the scene.</p>\n<p>So far, it was working.</p>\n<p>A door slammed open behind them. Light from the outside streamed in.</p>\n<p>Izuku sighed in relief when a familiar voice called out, \u201cIs everyone okay in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei!\u201d most of the class called out, relived.</p>\n<p>At the sound of their voice, Aizawa quickly entered the warehouse. His students flocked to him and nearly tackled him to the ground from the force of their hug. Aizawa stumbled, huffing at them, but there was an undeniable amount of relief in his eyes when he saw they were all okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Izuku called. Ochako waved at him.</p>\n<p>Aizawa took one look at the two newcomers and sighed. He walked over anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Aizawa asked.</p>\n<p>He still seemed to be checking over all his students to make sure they weren\u2019t terribly injured. Izuku liked to think he did a pretty decent job defending all of them when he saw there were no more than a few bruises and some minor cuts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidorishi ambushed us at the mall,\u201d Izuku told him. \u201cKurogiri warped us here. Midorishi and five Nomu tried to attack us. Shouto, Ochako and Kacchan showed up. They\u2019re from my world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to see you again, Aizawa-sensei,\u201d Ochako said.</p>\n<p>Shouto offered a wave. Aizawa looked at them and then pinched the bridge of his nose like he couldn\u2019t believe there were <em>more of them. </em>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>An explosion rocked the warehouse. In front of them, Midorishi and Kacchan were still locked in a battle. Midorishi had lost his remaining Nomu, having been burnt to a crisp not two feet from where he stood. Midorishi had long since lost his smile and was staring at Kacchan like he was the devil himself. Kacchan just bared his teeth in a grin (he was enjoying this way too much).</p>\n<p>Aizawa looked like he was about to step in but Shouto held out a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need any help, if you were wondering,\u201d Shouto said. He never took his eyes off the battle.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo has an awful personality but he\u2019s number two for a reason,\u201d Ochako agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNumber <em>TWO</em>?!\u201d Younger Kacchan spat.</p>\n<p>Kirishima had to hold him back so that he didn\u2019t lunge at Ochako.</p>\n<p>Ochako raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cI dealt with this fit once, Bakugo. I\u2019m not about to deal with it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Younger Kacchan spat at her in rage. The rest of the class, including her younger self, looked at her in surprise. It seemed that not many people were willing to talk to Kacchan like that. She saw their faces and laughed, proceeding to explain everything about what happened during the next few years of UA.</p>\n<p>The rest of the UA teachers arrived not five minutes later after Ochako had\u00a0thoroughly trapped everyone in what Izuku was\u00a0<em>sure\u00a0</em>was another embarrassing story about his hero exploits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was an initial rush of panic when they first arrived, unsure if the students were safe, but that faded when they saw the group watching Kacchan\u2019s match like a football game. All Might and Present Mic came to a stop next to Aizawa, watching the entire beatdown with wide eyes. The rest of the teachers followed suit, not exactly sure what the make of the entire situation.</p>\n<p>Izuku must think it was a little crazy with Shouto and Ochako there, standing next to their counterparts. The five Nomu were in various stages of disarrangement. Midorishi <em>was</em> there, but with the amount of explosives and the blonde and black blur, he didn\u2019t seem to be a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo?\u201d All Might asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugo,\u201d Aizawa agreed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, Tenko had thought the situation at the mall was only going from <em>bad</em> to <em>worse</em>.</p>\n<p>Kurogiri, the fucker, warped them all the what looked like an abandon warehouse (now wasn\u2019t that just <em>clich\u00e9\u2014</em>). Midorishi and his five Nomu were a terrifying sight to behold. When Midorishi attacked, Midoriya was immediately on the defensive, desperately fighting to keep them safe. Tenko couldn\u2019t help but think this was like Kamino Ward all over again. Except, this time, they didn\u2019t have any way to escape. Then, by some miracle, they were saved by people from Midoriya\u2019s own world.</p>\n<p>Not just <em>any</em> people, either. Todoroki Shouto, Uraraka Ochako and Bakugo <em>fucking </em>Katsuki.</p>\n<p>As the tide changed and the battle raged on, Tenko couldn\u2019t help but admire the three. They were so <em>different </em>from what he thought they would be like. Tenko had seen Midoriya\u2019s pictures, he knew they were different, but knowing something and seeing something were two very different experiences.</p>\n<p>This Todoroki carried himself with a dignity that their Todoroki didn\u2019t have yet. The calm, cool persona but without all the coldness. He was more approachable, more friendly. He joked and laughed and teased Midoriya.</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s Ochako was confident. She knew her abilities and used them to the fullest. She was strong and capable and let everyone know it by the way she carried herself, yet Tenko could still tell that she was every bit as kind and honest as the person he liked to call a friend.</p>\n<p>Tenko didn\u2019t get to form much of an opinion about their Bakugo, seeing as he blasted off to go beat up Midorishi almost immediately but Tenko couldn\u2019t help but be at least a <em>little </em>bit grateful that he was here. He couldn\u2019t help but admire the strength as he held off a hero that almost killed Aizawa in USJ with apparent ease.</p>\n<p>The most surprising change wasn\u2019t one of the newcomers; it was Midoriya himself. Tenko hadn\u2019t noticed how reserved Midoriya was being until he saw him next to people that he was comfortable with. He laughed and joked and took their teasing in his stride. His expression was open and truly happy\u2014a far cry from the smiles that he\u2019d been giving the entire time he\u2019d been suck in their world.</p>\n<p>Tenko was happy for him.</p>\n<p>Now, the battle was winding down. The teachers had arrived and Tenko could hear the distinct wail of police sirens on the distance. The man that had caused them all so much pain and suffering, from USJ all the way to Kamino Ward was finally defeated.</p>\n<p>It was over for Midorishi. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>When All Might first got the news that the class had been attacked and were currently missing, he panicked. He begged Aizawa to take him and let him search even though his power was completely gone. Aizawa had agreed, if he stayed with the police.</p>\n<p>All Might had never felt so useless. Those few hours wondering if his students were even still alive were the worst of his life. hen, they\u2019d gotten a call from Aizawa\u2014he\u2019d found them, they were safe, and All Might could finally breathe again.</p>\n<p>When he arrived at the scene, he could safely say that he was not the only one surprised by the outcome. His students were safe, of course, but they were not alone. Midoriya Izuku stood beside two newcomers\u2014two very, very familiar newcomers.</p>\n<p>All Might was willing to bet that there was a third, based on the explosions and the yelling that were oh so familiar.</p>\n<p>Todoroki Shouto, Uraraka Ochako and Bakugo Katsuki were not three people All Might expected to see. At least, not as grownups.</p>\n<p>The battle winded down to a close with Bakugo standing victorious. The gathered police didn\u2019t quite know what the make of the situation. All three of the newcomers showed their hero license although the debate over their validity was fresh on everyone\u2019s mind. They took it in stride, not quite sure if they were valid but not willing to argue\u2014and promptly tied the unconscious and beaten Midorishi as much as they could.</p>\n<p>With that, All for One was left without a successor.</p>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t stop him. Not for long. All Might knew that the most out of everyone but it would slow him down. Give them time for a counter attack. They would stop him before he ever got strong enough to search for another. With the combined might of UA, the knowledge that Midoriya had given them and the heroes from all around Japan, All Might was confident they would win.</p>\n<p>He looked at his students and hoped that they would never have to worry about that man again.</p>\n<p>The line of police was difficult to get through, but All Might managed. He approached where all of his students were gathered around, giving statements to the police. None of them seemed injured and for that, All Might was grateful, but they weren\u2019t who he was looking for.</p>\n<p>He found Midoriya Izuku and the rest of the people from his world near the corner of the warehouse. They seemed locked in conversation and All Might almost didn\u2019t want to interrupt, but some words needed to be spoken. As he approached, he started to hear snippets of their conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014You can let go of me,\u201d Midoriya was saying.</p>\n<p>The other Todoroki Shot has his hand firmly clamped on to Midoriya\u2019s wrist. Midoriya seemed to be giving him an exasperated look as he struggled to free it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Todoroki said. \u201cNaomasa said we <em>have</em> to be touching you if you want to be sent back with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The older Uraraka scratched the back of her head sheepishly. \u201cWe only had two hours to find you. We kinda got caught up in the chaos and lost track of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a dumbass who would definitely get his ass stuck here a <em>second</em> time if halfie let you go,\u201d Bakugo said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. I think I\u2019m done with dimension hooping,\u201d Midoriya said but still failed to free his wrist.</p>\n<p>Bakugo was the first to notice All Might, crossing his arms over his chest and raising his eyebrow. He was covered in a variety of bruises and cuts. One of his arms seemed to have taken the worst of it, with a large purple bruise spanning from his shoulder to his fingertips. One of his gauntlets was broken.</p>\n<p>Their Todoroki gave him a nod in greeting. Their Uraraka waved cheerfully. Midoriya turned around to face him with a smile on his face. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking at the four of them, standing together like the heroes they were, all All Might could say was, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked confused, like he didn\u2019t understand what All Might was thanking\u00a0them for. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might glanced back at his students who crowded around each other and chatted in excitement. All Might was just glad they were still alive to do such a thing. \u201cYou protected them. For that, I thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya blushed to the roots of his hair.</p>\n<p>Their Uraraka threw an arm around his shoulder with a smile and said, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be able to not help someone even if he tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d All Might said. \u201cYour world is lucky to have him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya sputtered out something incomprehensible with their Uraraka laughed.\u00a0Todoroki nudged him, wrist still firmly clasped in his hands. Bakugo crossed his arms and rolled his eyes with a <em>tsk </em>sound.</p>\n<p>These were heroes\u2014the ones that\u00a0promised with their blood, sweat and tears to protect the innocent. The people who poured their life into their work and see it not as a job but as a <em>duty. </em>\u00a0If his students came out to be half the heroes that these four were, All Might would consider himself satisfied.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of you,\u201d All Might said. He wished he could pour all of the gratitude he was feeling into words. Maybe then he would be able to properly thank all four of them. \u201cThank you all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t have helped more,\u201d said Midoriya, who had helped the most out of all of them.</p>\n<p>All Might looked at Midorishi Izuku in custody, going to Tartarus to never escape again. He thought of all the information they\u2019ve gained, all the plans that they received. All for One might still be free, but he had a devastating blow delivered to him tonight. It was only a matter of time before All for One was defeated as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy boy, you\u2019ve done plenty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya beamed at him. Their Uraraka elbowed him in the side playfully. Their Todoroki mothed something that looked suspiciously like <em>Dad Might </em>to Midoriya, who promptly stepped on his foot. The three laughed and joked and teased each other with Bakugo sitting on the sidelines looking resigned.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t even notice when the bright light appeared on the corner of Todoroki\u2019s face, quickly spreading down the side of his cheekbone.</p>\n<p>Just as All Might is about to say something (because being enveloped in light is <em>strange) </em>Bakugo stretched, cracking his fingers (which were already glowing) and said, \u201cFucking <em>finally</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The light had taken over at least half of their bodies at this point. A gold and green swirl of colors spreading as fast as it could. Their Uraraka lunged and grabbed Midoriya\u2019s shoulder, despite Todoroki never having once let go of his wrist. The light traveled from the tips of their fingers onto Midoriya who started to glow as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cTime to go now, I guess,\u201d Todoroki told All Might.</p>\n<p>The light had attracted more people and, by the time the light reached their toes, the entire class of 1-A was standing there and waving their goodbyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting,\u201d Tsuyu said.</p>\n<p>Ashido laughed in agreement. Sato and Shoji offered small waves. Aoyama flashed the four of them a dazzling smile. Sero, Ojiro Iida, Uraraka, Koda, Tokoyami, Hagakure, Todoroki and Yaomomo all called out their own version of a goodbye.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome visit us soon!\u201d Kaminari shouted and was promptly whacked by Jiro.</p>\n<p>Kirishima helped him to his feet while Bakugo\u2014the very Bakugo that All Might has been teaching\u2014rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>Tenko stood a little bit in front, bittersweet smile on his face. \u201cBye, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a fantastic hero, Tenko,\u201d Midoriya said. The green and gold light had almost covered his entire face. Pieces of the older Uraraka, Shouto and Bakugo were already chipping away into nothingness. \u201cTell Mirio I said goodbye.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenko looked at his hands and back to Midoriya. His gloved fingers curled into a determined fist. \u201cI will. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s feet started flaking away, leaving nothing there. Bakugo was almost completely gone already, Uraraka a close second. She still had her hand clasped firmly on Midoriya\u2019s shoulder. Todoroki hadn\u2019t let go of Izuku\u2019s wrist, despite being nothing more than a glowing torso at that point. The light grew brighter and brighter until All Might was forced to look away. He could only vaguely see Midoriya\u2019s outline through his fingers until suddenly there was no more.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku disappeared in a gold and green light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Midoriya Izuku opened his eyes, he was surrounded by his friends.</p>\n<p>They took one look at him, awake and okay <em>and alive</em> before tackling him to the ground. Their laughing and cheers and joy echoed around the pristine white room as they all chattered excitedly. Izuku almost felt overwhelmed. His friends missed him just as much as he missed them.</p>\n<p>It takes a while, and with some prompting from Naomasa, but they eventually untangle themselves and let Midoriya stand. He laughed, relieved tears running down his face as he hugged all of them, making assurances that <em>yes, he was okay</em> and <em>yes he was still alive</em> and <em>yes he was never going to do something like that again</em>.</p>\n<p>Sero patted him on the back. \u201cMidoriya, dude, don\u2019t ever scare us like that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"We kinda need you, dude,\" Kirishima agreed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tenya pushed his way through the crowd. Izuku made out his broad shoulders before he shot off for a hug. Tenya caught him with a breathless laugh before putting him down and holding him at arm\u2019s length. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2026\u201d Izuku said and there were definitely tears in his eyes. He was <em>so relived </em>to be back. There was a lot to say but\u2026he was <em>safe</em>, he was <em>home</em>, he surrounded by his friends and family, and most, importantly\u2026 \u201cTenya, I owe you an apology. I really do get in trouble just by being there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenya laughed and his friends pulled him into another hug. Their\u00a0comfort and joy was contagious. Izuku couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling. The past few weeks had been a lot, both mentally and physically. He\u2019d learned a lot of things about himself that he never knew. He learned from past mistakes and fixed ones for the future. His guilt, his grief, his laughter, his joy, his happiness. Yet, he felt most safe here, surrounded by friends.</p>\n<p>Midoriya Izuku was finally home.</p>"
