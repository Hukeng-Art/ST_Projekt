  "text": "<p>Mickey\u2019s always been scared of getting his words.</p>\n<p>Curious, sure, but more scared. \u00a0He\u2019s wondered where on his body they\u2019ll show up - everyone in his family seems to get them on their chests, but there\u2019s no guarantee he will too - and when they\u2019ll show up, of course. \u00a0When the slow process will begin, his skin first turning splotchy, then the words fading in, starting out so pale they\u2019re barely legible, gradually changing over the couple of weeks that follow until they\u2019re inky black, signalling that the meeting is almost upon him. \u00a0He\u2019s wondered what they\u2019ll be, most of all, but has been afraid to wonder that, too. \u00a0In case they\u2019re something that gives him away.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what that could be - it\u2019s not like many people randomly say things like, <em>hey, I\u2019m a dude you must be gay as shit </em>when they first meet strangers, so he\u2019s not gonna end up with that tattooed all over him. \u00a0But there\u2019s ways it could go wrong, still - if the guy introduces himself and has a name that\u2019s clearly <em>male, </em>Mickey could end up with that on his chest, his arm, the back of his neck, and that\u2019d be fucking hard to hide. \u00a0His dad would kill him before Mickey even had a chance to <em>meet </em>his soulmate.</p>\n<p>So Mickey\u2019s scared of his words, with good reason. \u00a0His only hope is the fact that in the south side, most people don\u2019t find their soulmates young, some people not at all. \u00a0His dad\u2019s never had his words. \u00a0Neither\u2019s Tony, or his aunt Rande. \u00a0His mom had hers, before she died, but he never knew the story there, what had happened to that guy, because she\u2019d been married to Terry since she was nineteen.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the one part of his life in which he hopes to end up like his dad. \u00a0So, of course, because the universe hates him, he gets his words when he\u2019s barely seventeen.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not even remotely prepared for it when he finds out, either. \u00a0He\u2019s in the middle of getting fucked, fast and hard and dirty, in the high school locker room. \u00a0He barely attends high school anymore, is on the verge of packing it in altogether, but it\u2019s worth coming around every now and then because of the closeted jock on the football team who has a big dick - even if he\u2019s not the best at using it for anyone\u2019s pleasure but his own, Mickey will take what he can get. \u00a0So he\u2019s getting fucked up against the lockers, as usual, and is getting pretty close to coming when suddenly the guy stops moving.</p>\n<p>Confused, Mickey spins his head around, ready to tell TJ to get on with it or get out, but the guy\u2019s curious expression stops him in his tracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man, I think you\u2019re getting your words,\u201d TJ says, like it\u2019s a passing observation, no big fucking deal. \u00a0\u201cOn your ass. \u00a0That or you have a rash.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mickey\u2019s stomach suddenly feels like lead. \u00a0He closes his eyes, rests his head against the cold metal of the lockers for a moment. \u00a0Of fucking <em>course </em>that\u2019s where they\u2019d be, as if it wasn\u2019t obvious enough already that he loves taking it up the ass. \u00a0In a way it\u2019s good - much less chance someone\u2019s gonna accidentally see them this way, which is good even if they\u2019re <em>not </em>incriminating because he knows as soon as anyone finds out they\u2019re gonna want to <em>meet </em>the girl, and there\u2019s no way Mickey will be able to come clean that it\u2019s definitely gonna be a <em>guy. </em>\u00a0But still. \u00a0This means he <em>is </em>gonna meet the guy, and soon, in probably just a couple of weeks. \u00a0And after that, there\u2019s not really gonna be any denying it any longer.</p>\n<p>Mickey wonders if he\u2019ll even be able to resist. \u00a0He\u2019s always told himself that when he meets his soulmate, he\u2019s not gonna do a thing about it. \u00a0Because that makes everything way too fucking <em>real.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cCan you read what they say?\u201d he asks next, his voice cracking. \u00a0The guy pauses for a moment, presumably examining Mickey\u2019s ass, which should be awkward but Mickey has bigger things on his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, no, they\u2019re still all pale and blurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mickey pauses for a second. \u00a0Takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you gonna finish me off or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Three nights later, Mandy goes to a party. \u00a0He waits til he\u2019s sure she\u2019s gone, then heads into her room. \u00a0Locks the door and pushes a chair up against the handle too, for good measure. \u00a0She\u2019s the only one who has a full length mirror.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s in there, he drops his pants, puts his back to the mirror, and turns his head, trying to read the faint words which are scrawled there. \u00a0They\u2019re still only a light tan colour, so clearly has has a little while to prepare for the meet itself, but still, they\u2019re definitely <em>there. \u00a0</em>Not just a rash, like he\u2019d kind of been hoping.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t read backwards, so he uses his shitty phone to take a picture of the reflection of his ass in the mirror and then looks at the photo. \u00a0The words there, scrawled across his left ass cheek in a messy all-caps handwriting, are -</p>\n<p>Mickey holds his breath the second before he reads them, because <em>this is it, </em>this is the rest of his life, he\u2019s trying not to be excited because this makes things so much more complicated but he can\u2019t help it, he has a soulmate and he\u2019s about to find out what their first words to him will ever be -</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dude, you dropped your eggplant.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Mickey sighs.</p>\n<p>Of fucking <em>course </em>he\u2019d have something as dumb as that.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Two weeks later to the day, he\u2019s walking back from knocking over the grocery store three streets over, arms laden down with enough food to hopefully get them through his dad\u2019s latest stint in the joint. \u00a0He passes Ian Gallagher in the street. \u00a0No big deal. \u00a0He\u2019s in Mandy\u2019s class and Mickey\u2019s known him since they were kids - they were on the same little league team together, and Mickey\u2019s done a few deals with his asshole brother, Lip. \u00a0Never really spoken to Ian, though, as far as he can remember. \u00a0Hasn\u2019t had a reason to - even if the last year or so he\u2019s checked out Ian\u2019s body on more than one occasion, since puberty hit him <em>hard </em>and left him with the kind of muscles Mickey likes to jerk off thinking about. \u00a0Still. \u00a0No big deal.</p>\n<p>Until, three seconds after they pass each other, he hears Ian calling something to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you dropped your eggplant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mickey feels the grocery bags go tumbling out of his hands, but doesn\u2019t even register when they thump to the ground, or when the milk carton explodes and soaks his sneakers.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>That night, he lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u00a0There\u2019s a few glow-in-the-dark star stickers up there, left over from when he was a kid, though they\u2019re mostly peeled off now, the ones still left dirty and lacking any actual <em>glow.</em></p>\n<p>He thinks Ian Gallagher must think he\u2019s a freak.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s somehow his biggest concern. \u00a0He\u2019d heard his words, tumbling out of Ian\u2019s mouth like they were <em>no big deal, </em>which he guesses they weren\u2019t, to Ian. \u00a0Ian didn\u2019t know, so he\u2019d said them, and Mickey had heard them, and he\u2019d dropped his groceries, and then he\u2019d realised what had happened and scooped everything back up into his arms as quick as he could, leaving half of it just lying there on the street, and he\u2019d run off.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even said a word back to Ian. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t wanted Ian to <em>know.</em></p>\n<p>And now he\u2019s left here. \u00a0Ian fucking Gallagher as a soulmate. \u00a0His life a hell of a lot more complicated.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Mickey honestly, truly tries to stay away.</p>\n<p>But as it turns out, he is a hopeless slave to fate. \u00a0Three days after he hears his words tumbling out of Ian\u2019s mouth, he feels like he\u2019s ready to itch right out of his skin, is turned wild and restless and <em>wanting. \u00a0</em>He leaves the house, promising himself he\u2019ll just walk by Gallagher for a second, just enough to catch a glimpse, and hope that\u2019ll soothe him down a bit, enough to at least be able to catch a wink or two of sleep.</p>\n<p>Of course, because Mickey has much less self control than he likes to give himself credit for, he ends up inside the Kash and Grab, walking up and down the aisles like what flavour of Doritos to get is the biggest fucking decision he\u2019ll ever make in his life, sneaking not-so-secret glances at Ian. \u00a0Ian, who has his military-cut hair and bulging muscles and tight jeans, but still wears the dumb little red shop apron, like he\u2019s twelve fucking years old. \u00a0Ian who is flicking through a magazine at the counter, not even paying attention to what Mickey\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Eventually Mickey walks out without paying for his pringles. \u00a0He\u2019s half hoping Ian will say something, but instead Ian just shoots a dirty look at his back, stays silent.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Mickey starts stealing from the Kash and Grab on a regular basis, even though it\u2019s a block further away from his house than the store he usually goes to, and doesn\u2019t stock the kind of Gatorade he likes. \u00a0Ian\u2019s there Saturday mornings, and every day after school except Thursdays. \u00a0If those shifts happen to coincide with the times Mickey visits - well, nobody has to know that but him.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He spends a month watching Ian, never saying a word. \u00a0Every single night, when he\u2019s twisted up in his itchy sheets and the streetlamp outside his bedroom window is flickering, painting his room with a nervous kind of light, he dreams of Ian.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Another month passes.</p>\n<p>Mickey can see Ian getting more and more annoyed every time he steals something from the Kash and Grab. \u00a0He could stop, he knows - probably should, if he <em>ever </em>intends to let Ian know about the whole soulmate thing, because he hardly wants Ian starting to hate him. \u00a0But he doesn\u2019t, still, because if he stops going into the Kash and Grab then he stops seeing <em>Ian, </em>and he knows he\u2019s pathetic but that\u2019s just something he can\u2019t handle.</p>\n<p>So he keeps stealing, and Ian keeps getting more and more pissed, but never saying anything.</p>\n<p>Until the day when he does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a cold, grey-skied Wednesday, and Mickey\u2019s stealing instant oatmeal from the Kash and Grab. \u00a0He figures that\u2019s the kind of warm, winter food that he should be attempting to get Mandy to eat, since she\u2019s been looking more and more stick-thin by the day recently. \u00a0He chooses a bunch of different flavours - one with cinnamon, one with chocolate, one with some kind of gross dried fruit in it that he figures is basically healthy. \u00a0When he\u2019s picked out a handful of packets, he exits the store, lingering for just a moment to offer Ian a wave and a smirk. \u00a0Ignoring the way it makes his stomach flip just to look at Ian\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Ten seconds later, he\u2019s across the street, and he hears Ian calling after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mickey, why don\u2019t you steal from a neighborhood you don\u2019t live in? \u00a0Show some civic pride!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mickey has a thousand comebacks he could throw over his shoulder, each one with a different effect. \u00a0But - well, if he says them, if he says <em>anything, </em>it\u2019ll be the thing that\u2019s written on Ian\u2019s body, and then Ian will <em>know.</em></p>\n<p>So instead Mickey just turns around, cocks an eyebrow, stares at Ian for one long, hard moment.</p>\n<p>Ian stares back.</p>\n<p>Which has never happened before.</p>\n<p>Mickey is long, long used to his reputation preceding him. \u00a0Even back before he <em>had </em>a reputation of his own, when he was just a scrawny kid in second hand clothes who mostly kept to himself, people would hiss at each other to stay away from him. \u00a0He\u2019d hear them. \u00a0<em>That\u2019s Mickey Milkovich. \u00a0Yeah, </em>those <em>Milkoviches. \u00a0Stay away from him, his dad\u2019s a maniac, his brothers will kill you if you look at him wrong! </em>\u00a0With that legacy, it wasn\u2019t exactly hard for him to start scaring people all on his own. \u00a0He was a scrappy fighter, and his older brothers were all muscle and tended to follow him everywhere, so by the time he was ten years old, even most adults in their neighborhood were wary of him, let alone the kids.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d played that to his advantage, because he didn\u2019t get many chances for <em>advantages, </em>and it seemed a shame to waste it.</p>\n<p>And now he\u2019s staring at Ian Gallagher, a threat, Ian must <em>know </em>it\u2019s a threat, only Ian\u2019s not looking away. \u00a0He\u2019s the first one who\u2019s ever looked at Mickey like that. \u00a0Challenging, not an ounce of fear clouding his expression.</p>\n<p>Mickey looks away first. \u00a0Pretends like it\u2019s no big deal, flips Ian the bird and continues walking, doesn\u2019t say a word, doesn\u2019t return the shit he stole or anything.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shaking when he gets home. \u00a0The next time he goes into the Kash and Grab, he pays. \u00a0His purchases come to $12.49 and he only hands over a ten dollar bill, but Ian still looks like it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to him.</p>\n<p>Mickey thinks it\u2019s worth swallowing a little bit of his own pride to put that look on Ian Gallagher\u2019s face. \u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Mandy was born one year and one day after Mickey. \u00a0He didn\u2019t celebrate a single one of his own birthdays growing up, always overshadowed by her, because she was younger and cuter and the only girl, the one their parents doted on to the full extent they knew how to dote. \u00a0They\u2019d loved her most. \u00a0And he\u2019d loved her too, reluctantly at first but eventually with a kind of devotion he\u2019d never felt an ounce of for any of his other siblings.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d loved her, but he\u2019d never been under the impression that she was anything other than a cutely-packaged mechanism for making his life more difficult.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s seventeen, he is reminded of this fact tenfold, because when he\u2019s seventeen she decides to become best friends with Ian Gallagher.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The first time Mickey walks into his house and finds Ian sat on the couch, he thinks he\u2019s going mad. \u00a0His shitstorm of a life has finally gotten to him. \u00a0He\u2019s cracked. \u00a0He freezes in the doorway for a moment, no idea what to do, if he should run screaming in the other direction or just pretend like everything\u2019s normal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d says Ian when he sees Mickey enter, sounding a little awkward but not nearly as much as he probably should.</p>\n<p>Mickey just nods in response, bewildered, stares at him for a moment longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m waiting for Mandy,\u201d Ian tacks on, apparently realising that Mickey is going fucking <em>crazy </em>not understanding what\u2019s going on. \u00a0And - okay, Mickey knows Ian and Mandy are in the same class, but they\u2019ve hung out before, he didn\u2019t know they\u2019d ever actually fucking <em>spoken, </em>so it makes zero sense that Ian is here.</p>\n<p>Still, he can\u2019t say any of that. \u00a0Can\u2019t say anything at all, without giving himself away. \u00a0So he just forces his feet to move, forces his gaze not to linger on the bare skin of Ian\u2019s shoulder where his shirt has slipped to the side, and heads towards his room.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s in there, he sees Mandy emerging from the bathroom, her skirt too short and shirt too low, made up like she\u2019s going for a fucking photoshoot or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cIan <em>Gallagher</em>?\u201d he asks her quietly, standing too close to her and not caring, because he can\u2019t help the fucking <em>ridiculous </em>twinge of jealousy that\u2019s settled in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet over it,\u201d she replies, rolling her eyes, though she doesn\u2019t even know he <em>has </em>anything to get over. \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s cool, we\u2019re friends. \u00a0Hey, we\u2019re gonna sneak into a movie, wanna come?\u201d</p>\n<p>Usually when Mandy invites him to shit like that he takes her up on the offer, since he rarely has anything better to do and Mandy\u2019s one of the few people he actually finds remotely fun to be around. \u00a0But the thought of being anywhere <em>near </em>Ian for such an extended period of time creates such a violent reaction in his body, half pain and half terrifying anticipation of pleasure, that he turns her down with a single sharp shake of his head.</p>\n<p>She shrugs at him, curls her lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Months pass, and Ian Gallagher seems to <em>always </em>be around. \u00a0Playing video games with Mandy on the couch, eating with her at the kitchen table, holed up in her bedroom laughing so loud it echoes around the whole house, walking through Mickey\u2019s room to take a piss. \u00a0Mickey can\u2019t take a step in his own house without finding himself closer to Ian than he feels he can safely be.</p>\n<p>It sucks, because when he\u2019d just been seeing Ian in tiny broken moments, all he\u2019d really had to focus on was the way Ian looked and spoke and sometimes the sound of his laugh, if Mickey was lucky enough to catch one of those occasions. \u00a0And Ian had been gorgeous and funny and made Mickey\u2019s heart flip in ways that were closer to horrific than lovely, but still, that had been all there was to him. \u00a0Mickey had <em>known </em>Ian was his soulmate, but in a way, it hadn\u2019t really been true, yet.</p>\n<p>Only when he\u2019s over at Mickey\u2019s house every single fucking day, Mickey can\u2019t help it - he <em>watches. \u00a0</em>Ian with Mandy is relaxed, he\u2019s playful and fun, he\u2019s what he must be like usually, when he\u2019s not at work or school, which are the only times Mickey has ever really seen him. \u00a0He makes jokes about old films sometimes, which Mandy never gets but Mickey always does, laughs silently to himself from around whatever corner he\u2019s been listening from. \u00a0Ian sucks at video games but makes great scrambled eggs, can shoot a gun better than Mickey and also dye Mandy\u2019s hair so her highlights are <em>just right, </em>chews with his mouth open and doesn\u2019t smoke as much as Mickey and can\u2019t hold his booze and laughs like a fucking maniac at kids\u2019 TV shows which shouldn\u2019t be funny to anyone over the age of five.</p>\n<p>Mickey doesn\u2019t say a word to Ian, still, for three more months of this shit, but what he <em>does </em>is fall fucking head over fucking heels in fucking deep-shit love.</p>\n<p>He stops stealing from the Kash and Grab just to get a <em>break </em>from it all.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He leaves his bedroom door open when Ian and Mandy are in the kitchen, just so he can hear them talk. \u00a0Sits in the kitchen when they\u2019re on the couch, so he can hear Ian\u2019s laugh and the way he swears when Mandy kicks his ass at halo. \u00a0Sits with them on the front steps when the days start to get warm, drinking beers but never saying a word, just listening to Ian and ignoring whatever Mandy says.</p>\n<p>Summer comes and Ian starts wearing less clothes. \u00a0Mickey goes crazier by the minute.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>One night, Ian and Mandy stay up too late, getting high in Mandy\u2019s room and giggling like little kids. \u00a0It\u2019s dark out by the time they come to their senses, and Ian decides to sleep over.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Mickey wakes up to the sound of the shower running. \u00a0Groans, because it had dragged him away from a particularly delectable dream about Ian rimming him - he has the morning wood to prove it. \u00a0He wonders who\u2019s in the shower, how long they\u2019ll be, if he could kick them out to take care of his boner.</p>\n<p>Pretty much as soon as he has that thought, though, the water shuts off. \u00a0He hears someone thumping around in the bathroom for a few moments, and then the door swings open, and the culprit of the noise emerges into Mickey\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Ian. \u00a0Wet haired and bare-chested, his jeans pulled on hastily, unbuttoned, clinging to his legs where he\u2019d clearly not dried himself from the shower properly. \u00a0Mickey\u2019s dick twitches as soon as he sees Ian, and Ian freezes when he sees that Mickey\u2019s awake. \u00a0Stares at him.</p>\n<p>Their eyes meet, and Mickey tries not to think about the fact that he has a very obvious erection tenting his sheets.</p>\n<p>When Ian just keeps staring at him, not saying a word, Mickey swallows, hard. \u00a0It would be so easy, he thinks, to say something in that moment. \u00a0Anything. \u00a0From the hostile to the sweet to the suggestive. \u00a0<em>The fuck are you looking at, douchebag </em>to <em>you wanna come and take care of this for me</em> with an eyebrow raised. \u00a0But no matter what he said, it\u2019d give him away.</p>\n<p>He says nothing, and just stares. \u00a0He\u2019s not ready yet. \u00a0Isn\u2019t sure if he ever will be.</p>\n<p>Ian stares back. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t <em>know, </em>of course, he can\u2019t know, has no way of knowing how deeply he is connected to Mickey, how deeply they always <em>will </em>be connected, as long as they\u2019re both alive. \u00a0But it seems like he knows <em>something, </em>or feels something at least.</p>\n<p>For a moment, it seems like maybe he wants Mickey, just as badly as Mickey wants him.</p>\n<p>Then he breaks their gaze and leaves Mickey\u2019s room, and everything is secret and shit, all over again.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes your brother ever <em>speak?\u201d </em>he hears Ian mutter to Mandy one time. \u00a0He nearly laughs, but forces himself to hold it it. \u00a0He\u2019s hovering outside Mandy\u2019s bedroom door, not even bothering to pretend it\u2019s for any other reason than the fact he saw Ian go in there with her a minute ago, and he doesn\u2019t want to give himself away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho, Mickey?\u201d Mandy responds, sounding bored. \u00a0\u201cIgnore him, he\u2019s just the grumpiest fuckwad to ever live.\u201d</p>\n<p>That stings. \u00a0Not because Mandy\u2019s saying it - he knows she\u2019s partly joking, because they\u2019ve always been the closest of all their siblings, actually kind of get along, and teasing comes with that package. \u00a0But because of who she\u2019s saying it to. \u00a0Mickey <em>knows </em>it\u2019s ridiculous, knows he\u2019s had a million chances to speak to Ian and that <em>he\u2019s </em>the one who\u2019s stopping them from knowing each other, because he\u2019s afraid and stubborn and confused as shit. \u00a0But still. \u00a0The idea that all Ian knows about him is his reputation, the fact that he steals from the store, Mandy\u2019s hostile descriptions - it fucking stings.</p>\n<p>He wonders if, even if he <em>told </em>Ian, Ian wouldn\u2019t want him as a soulmate. \u00a0Would turn him down. \u00a0Settle for someone else instead, because clearly the universe has made some kind of <em>grand </em>cosmic fuck up. \u00a0Ian\u2019s too fucking good for Mickey.</p>\n<p>The more Mickey thinks about it, the more he realises that Ian\u2019s words on his skin just don\u2019t make <em>sense. \u00a0</em>Ian\u2019s better than good, and Mickey - well, he\u2019s anything <em>but. \u00a0</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mean to tell Mandy.</p>\n<p>It just sort of - happens.</p>\n<p>It was probably inevitable, in a way, he decides later. \u00a0He\u2019s been going fucking <em>crazy </em>keeping this shit to himself, unable to stop thinking about Ian for a single second of the day but unable to <em>do </em>anything about it either. \u00a0He spends half his time jerking off and the other half battling an existential crisis; he was bound to snap at some point.</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s a pretty random time for it to happen. \u00a0Ian\u2019s just left after hanging out with Mandy the whole afternoon, and Mickey and Mandy are sat down at the table, eating poptarts for dinner and not talking about much. \u00a0Mickey can\u2019t get Ian out of his head, because Ian and Mandy had been playing with water pistols in the yard, since the day was blistering hot, and Ian had taken his shirt off.</p>\n<p>Mickey\u2019s not sure he\u2019s actually ever <em>seen </em>as many muscles on a guy as there are on Ian Gallagher, but he is sure that it\u2019s gonna drive him crazy for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>So, he and Mandy are sat in mostly silence, eating their poptarts at the table, and suddenly Mickey just can\u2019t contain it any longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and his voice breaks and he has to clear his throat and he can feel himself sweating with nerves. \u00a0\u201cI, uh. \u00a0I.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t get the words out. \u00a0Mandy rolls her eyes at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it? \u00a0You look constipated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIan\u2019s my soulmate.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blurts it out, without even thinking about how to phrase it, what Mandy\u2019s reaction is gonna be. \u00a0Then he takes a big bite of poptart, and waits for the fallout.</p>\n<p>Mandy doesn\u2019t respond for ten seconds. \u00a0Just stares at him. \u00a0Her jaw hanging open; he can see a half-chewed lump of poptart on her tongue. \u00a0After the ten seconds, she spits it out onto her plate, coughs a couple of times, then looks up at him again, eyes bugging out of her head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What?\u201d </em>she hisses, leaning in close like she has to be secret, even though they\u2019re the only ones in the house - Mickey wouldn\u2019t have said it if they weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, got my words, back in January. \u00a0And. \u00a0It was Ian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not - you\u2019re not <em>gay.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cObviously I <em>am, </em>alright. \u00a0Maybe I don\u2019t go shouting it all over town, but whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIan never said <em>anything</em> to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe, uh. \u00a0Doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mickey feels a little guilty after he admits that, thumbs at his lip, suddenly deflating from his huffed-up anger of just a moment ago. \u00a0Mandy looks like she might have a fuckin\u2019 stroke.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How </em>can he not <em>know</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t actually ever said a fuckin\u2019 word to him,\u201d Mickey admits, feeling as close as he ever gets to sheepish. \u00a0Mandy pauses for one long moment before she hits him on the arm, hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>douchebag,\u201d </em>she cries, hits him again, ignoring his yell of protest. \u00a0\u201cYou know he thinks there\u2019s something <em>wrong </em>with him? \u00a0Because he got his words months ago and nobody\u2019s ever said them to him? \u00a0He thinks the guy doesn\u2019t <em>want </em>him or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI -\u201d says Mickey, starts to attempt to explain himself, even though he doesn\u2019t have a clue how he\u2019s gonna do that, but Mandy cuts him off with a glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>do </em>want him, right?\u201d she checks, voice turning dark. \u00a0Fuck. \u00a0Mickey had realised Ian and Mandy were friends, best friends even, but he hadn\u2019t really thought about how big of a deal that was - Mandy who\u2019d never really had friends, growing up, who had always been too hostile and reserved, had learned early on that to like someone was to be vulnerable and being vulnerable only ever resulted in the worst fucking kind of pain. \u00a0She\u2019s opened herself up, to Ian, and that\u2019s a <em>big </em>fucking deal, and Mickey suddenly gets the feeling that she\u2019ll kill him, if he fucks things up with Ian more than he already has.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I <em>want </em>him,\u201d he says, partly to calm her down but also partly because of how fucking <em>true </em>it is. \u00a0\u201cHow could anyone <em>not, </em>Jesus, he\u2019s fucking perfect. \u00a0I just - it\u2019s too difficult, okay. \u00a0It\u2019s too fucked up. \u00a0If anyone found out, they\u2019d fucking kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mandy apparently doesn\u2019t take that as a good excuse, because she starts hitting him again, her skinny fists battering into his arms and chest over and over again, surprisingly strong.</p>\n<p>Mickey doesn\u2019t even tries to fight back. \u00a0He gets it. \u00a0He wants to protect Ian more than anything, too.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>He breaks on a Sunday.</p>\n<p>Ian and Mandy are making something in the kitchen. \u00a0Stew, maybe, or soup, all Mickey knows is it involves a fuckload of vegetables and a lot of laughing, and they\u2019re passing a joint back and forth between them as they cook so whatever it is they\u2019re making is gonna be tinged with the taste of smoke and bitter-sweet weed, which Mickey thinks will actually be an improvement on their usual cooking.</p>\n<p>Mickey\u2019s wandering around the living room, pretending like he\u2019s actually tidying up or some shit, just so he has an excuse to watch what Ian\u2019s doing. \u00a0Mandy keeps catching him at it and sending him these <em>looks, </em>like she thinks he\u2019s the most pathetic thing on the face of the planet and she probably wouldn\u2019t even bother to scrape him off the bottom of her shoe if she stepped on him in the street, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. \u00a0Ian\u2019s wearing cut offs and a t-shirt that\u2019s a little too big for him, exposes a bit more of his shoulder than it should, and his hair is growing out a little longer these days, and everything about him drives Mickey crazy.</p>\n<p>What drives Mickey most crazy is when he hears what Ian and Mandy are talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m <em>ever </em>gonna get my soulmate,\u201d Mandy\u2019s complaining, and Ian laughs a little, though Mickey can tell she\u2019s not really joking.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, better never getting one than having your words show up but never actually <em>hearing </em>them,\u201d Ian says, and Mickey freezes in his tracks. \u00a0It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s heard Ian mention that, and he\u2019s seen glimpses of Ian\u2019s words, sometimes, they\u2019re on the inside of his bicep and occasionally when he\u2019s been messing around in the garden with Mandy or raising a video controller especially high Mickey\u2019s caught <em>glimpses</em>, but he\u2019s never actually seen what they <em>say, </em>only that they\u2019re scrawled in a handwriting that is unmistakably his, and that they\u2019re <em>there. \u00a0</em>Have been for a while. \u00a0Probably since that very first day when Ian had spoken to him and Mickey hadn\u2019t said anything back.</p>\n<p>Mickey turns around, slowly, takes a couple of steps towards the kitchen. \u00a0Mandy\u2019s chopping peppers.</p>\n<p>Ian\u2019s chopping an eggplant.</p>\n<p>Mickey thinks about the words on his left ass cheek, about the day he\u2019d heard Ian say them, <em>dude you dropped your eggplant,</em> about how he\u2019s replayed that moment so many times in his head, thought of all the different ways it could have gone if he\u2019d said something back, <em>anything </em>back. \u00a0Thinks about how Ian\u2019s hot as fuck and funny as shit, about how Ian seems somehow kind to his core but still ten times more badass than Mickey, about how everything Ian does seems fucking perfect, even when he messes up he\u2019s somehow still perfect, even when Mickey finds himself <em>furious </em>Ian\u2019s still perfect.</p>\n<p>He thinks about how Ian is trying to hide the hurt in his voice when he talks about the soulmate who never showed up, but how Mickey can still hear it there, can see it in the downturn of Ian\u2019s eyes, the way his voice raises just a little at the end of his sentence.</p>\n<p>He looks at Ian chopping eggplant, his fingers shaking, just a little.</p>\n<p>And then he can\u2019t help himself. \u00a0<em>Breaks. \u00a0</em>Storms into the kitchen, his legs moving without even consulting the rest of him, walks right up to Ian, grabs his neck, roughly, pulls him close.</p>\n<p>Says the words which will change everything.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt\u2019s me, asshole.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Later, when Ian and Mickey are in Mickey\u2019s bed, fucking like the sheets are on fire and they need to put them out with their come, Mickey will feels Ian\u2019s arms wrap around him, Ian\u2019s lips sucking on his neck. \u00a0He\u2019ll shift his eyes over, just a little, and see the inside of Ian\u2019s bicep where it\u2019s braced next to his head. \u00a0Will see the words scrawled there - <em>his </em>words.</p>\n<p>Ian will laugh slightly, and dig his fingers into Mickey\u2019s ass, hard. \u00a0It will feel like being owned, in a way. \u00a0It will also feel like being more free than he\u2019s ever been.</p>"
