  "text": "<p>\u201cYou have a car,\u201d Stiles says for probably the thousandth time since he met Derek Hale. \u201cA nice one. A far nicer one than mine. Why can\u2019t you drive yourself to these midnight forest shenanigans?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares over at him. \u201cI need backup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn a Friday night? I could have had plans, buddy. Hot plans.\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t, of course, thanks to Scott\u2019s soul-encompassing love for Allison and the date nights that entailed, but that is not the point.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that Stiles could have had a date. Like it was outside the <i>realm of possibility</i>. Stiles throws his hands up in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t choose one of your merry band of werewolves why?\u201d Stiles continues, because seriously, the only one who has ever considered him backup is Scott, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s the brains in that particular investigative duo. He is in no way shape, form or fashion backup material for an Alpha werewolf.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need someone whose version of events won\u2019t be swayed,\u201d Derek says after a pause, which for him is positively bursting with information. </p>\n<p>\u201cWait, are we hunting for something that can <i>sway werewolves</i>?\u201d Stiles can pick up on things. Especially things that sound stupidly dangerous.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer, which for Derek is all the answer necessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap on a stick,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cIs there no end to the parade of monsters lurking around our supposedly quiet small town?\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Wandering the woods with Derek is slightly less terrifying than wandering the woods with Scott, though that mostly has to do with how Stiles is maybe a little afraid of Derek and figures most other things that go bump in the night must be, too. He has a scary vibe that\u2019s hard to beat.</p>\n<p>Plus Derek actually has a fucking clue where he\u2019s going, so there\u2019s considerably less aimless wandering and more direct stalking of prey. Stiles had been dreading how much chit-chat he would have to come up with if the path had been meandering.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t exactly sure when deliberately stalking prey became a <i>good</i> thing, but that\u2019s something that happens these days. So, goodie.</p>\n<p>The only terrible part about stalking with Derek is that apparently talking is a big no-no, and Stiles gets hushed with a smack to the side of the head every time he so much as opens his mouth. As a result he has to bite his lip roughly every fifteen seconds to keep from blurting out another, \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d or \u201cI think we passed this tree ten minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Derek stops so suddenly that Stiles actually runs into his back, and embarrassingly enough, just bounces right back off, since Derek\u2019s back feels roughly like running into a brick wall wearing a leather jacket. Derek turns and grabs Stiles by the front of his hoodie before Stiles crashes to the ground, and glares. </p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure it\u2019s Derek\u2019s \u201cmake a single noise and I\u2019ll end you\u201d glare, so he does his best not to squeak or shuffle his feet or topple over again when Derek releases his hoodie. Derek drags him to what is apparently a more stealthy section of underbrush, shoves Stiles down behind a tree, then crouches next to him, peering through the lower branches of a bush at\u2026 something.</p>\n<p>Stiles leans his back against the tree and wonders if pulling out his phone is a no-no. He figures it probably is, and then suddenly realizes that he can hear something out in the forest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not an animal. It\u2019s definitely a voice saying something. No, chanting something. Stiles stares at Derek, eyes wide. He\u2019s seen enough SyFy movies that he\u2019s got a handle on what he\u2019s hearing here. He taps Derek on the shoulder, and mouths, \u201cWitch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods grimly. </p>\n<p>Stiles twists a little to try to peer around the tree. It\u2019s not a full moon \u2013 he\u2019d be crazy to be wandering the woods with a werewolf if it were \u2013 but pretty much every reference to witches he\u2019s found in his search for ancient werewolf lore included the phrase \u2018dance naked in the moonlight.\u201d It\u2019s a half-moon, so there\u2019s totally some moonlight out there just begging to be danced in.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s someone out there in the woods, though it\u2019s too dark and far away to tell whether they\u2019re naked or not. All he can make out is a silhouette. The chanting is still going on in a low, steady drone that Stiles is pretty sure is the witchy equivalent to elevator music. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much magic going on, but beside him, Derek is extremely still \u2013 Stiles can\u2019t even hear his breath \u2013 and his crouch is looking more and more predatory by the second. </p>\n<p>All Stiles wanted to do tonight was to write an English report and maybe watch some youtube videos of puppies, and yet here he is in the forest with a werewolf and a witch.</p>\n<p>Derek motions for Stiles to stay where he's at, and then he disappears off in the direction of the witch.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to mentally run through everything he knows about witches, but most of it came from stuff like Sabrina the Teenage Witch or movies about naughty witches and he\u2019s pretty sure that none of the pointy-hat stuff is accurate. At least, he can\u2019t see any pointy hats from his vantage point of behind a tree. There was the stuff about naked dancing, and witches worshipping the devil, and\u2026</p>\n<p>Wait, what had Derek said in the Jeep? Something about being swayed.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Stiles remembers why witches had been mentioned on websites about the history of lycanthropy, and he peers around the tree, practically hugging it as he leans around and tries to catch sight of Derek.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s fire where the witch is now, and he can see her well enough to tell that she\u2019s both clothed and in the middle of some sort of ritual or spell or incantation or whatever the hell witches called their weird-ass midnight activities. He can\u2019t, however, see Derek, which spoke well of Derek\u2019s abilities as a creature of stealth, but is completely fucking annoying when Stiles is trying to save his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d he hisses. \u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>No response. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Stiles mutters, and slides out from behind the tree. He\u2019s moving closer to the witch and risking being seen with every movement, which feels monumentally stupid even to someone with no previous experience with witches, but he has to stop Derek from doing something dangerous.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d he stage whispers, which is as loud as he\u2019s willing to get. He\u2019s close enough now to see that the witch is a hot girl, roughly college-age, and there is a motherfucking <i>ring of fire</i> around her. She\u2019s on her knees, eyes closed, arms raised up towards the night sky, and Stiles hopes that luck is on his side for the first time ever as he darts from tree to tree.</p>\n<p>Derek has to have heard him \u2013 Stiles is not stealthy \u2013 so he has to know something\u2019s up. And he was raised in a family of werewolves. Probably Stiles doesn\u2019t have any knowledge that would be new or helpful.</p>\n<p>But then there\u2019s the fact that Derek went closer to the witch even after seeing that it <i>was</i> a witch, which is stunningly ill-advised, and Stiles still doesn\u2019t know why he was out here looking for someone in the first place. Really, this whole evening is shaping up to be the sort of disaster that Stiles would expect from an outing with Scott, not from a professional supernatural creature like Derek.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to chance going back to his original hiding-tree, which seems stunningly safe after getting this close to a witch doing spells in a circle of fire, when Derek is suddenly there, in his space, shoving him against a tree and pressing a finger against his lips. </p>\n<p>Like Stiles really thought this was the time for a loud conversation.</p>\n<p>He nods, but then Derek\u2019s eyes glow red, and his head jerks up in an alarmingly animalistic way. Derek stares open-mouthed at the witch, her circle\u2019s fire reflecting in his eyes, and then suddenly Stiles is being tugged out into the open.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s the puppy dog,\u201d the witch says. \u201cAnd he brought a chew toy, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles really wants to tell the witch exactly how lame that line was, but she\u2019s doing <i>magic</i> and Stiles isn\u2019t quite that blas\u00e9 about the supernatural yet. He waits on Derek to snarl or something.</p>\n<p>But Derek just stands there, head cocked, watching the witch with his glowing wolf\u2019s eyes. There\u2019s something <i>off</i> about his stance. Something about the set of his shoulders, the placement of his feet\u2026 It\u2019s all slightly wrong, somehow. And then Derek starts to move towards the witch.</p>\n<p>His movements are jerky and slow, like he\u2019s fighting against them, and the hand that\u2019s gripping Stiles\u2019 hoodie starts to twist and grow into claws. Stiles tries to pull away, hoping the material will rip and release him, but he has no such luck.</p>\n<p>Derek is being controlled, and Stiles is caught along with him.</p>\n<p>He really, really wishes he\u2019d gone for the zippered hoodie as he tries to squirm out of his sweatshirt-prison, but he just gets tangled up and has to stumble along desperately after Derek, who walks straight up to the witch\u2019s circle.</p>\n<p>The flames are bright and hot, and Derek\u2019s claws graze against his arm as he gets a better grip on Stiles\u2019 sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d the witch says. Stiles thinks again of the phrase he read that sent him after Derek \u2013 animal to call. Derek is an alpha werewolf that Stiles has personally seen force other werewolves \u2013 predators \u2013 to cower, yet the witch is commanding him around like a puppet.</p>\n<p>The thought of what she could make him do terrifies Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Derek grinds out, and Stiles is impressed that he\u2019s actually managing independent thought. The stuff he read seemed to imply that a witch calling an animal with her power exerted complete control.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have need of muscle,\u201d the witch says lazily. She\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s about to go to a goth-themed frat party, and Stiles would laugh if he wasn\u2019t seeing evidence of how scary-powerful she was. The flames leap higher; he wants to step back but Derek still has a vice grip on his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome to mine,\u201d Derek replies. He\u2019s standing shock-still, and Stiles thinks he\u2019s fighting against the witch\u2019s unseen control with everything he has. His grip on Stiles\u2019 arm shifts slightly, and his claws sink into Stiles\u2019 flesh.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all Stiles can do to stay upright and not scream; it\u2019s a sharper, brighter pain than anything he\u2019s ever experienced. Derek isn\u2019t moving. His claws are still embedded deep in Stiles\u2019 arm, and Stiles blinks rapidly to try to clear the bright dots that are dancing in his vision.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re mine.\u201d The witch is smiling at Derek, completely ignoring Stiles, and then she starts to chant again in the strange language from earlier. Stiles tries to focus on that, to keep himself from embarrassing himself by passing out, and he thinks the language is Latin. It\u2019s oddly formal.</p>\n<p>Just like the way she\u2019s moving around the interior of her flaming circle, he realizes. It reminds him of a Catholic church service he\u2019d gone to years before, where everyone else in attendance knew the rituals of the service by heart and Stiles had stumblingly followed their lead. The precision of it seems important, like if they were somehow interrupted\u2026</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s jaw is tensed so hard that his pulse is practically visible, and Stiles has no clue what the witch is wanting to use him for, but everything about the fire and incantations and the fact that she wants <i>muscle</i> seems to scream that it\u2019s for something really bad. So he has to figure out some way to break the ritual.</p>\n<p>He can feel his blood running down his arm, dripping to the ground, and he tries to force himself to <i>think</i>. Derek starts growling, quietly at first, but as the spell seems to thicken the air around them, his teeth elongate and his eyes gleam even brighter, and the growls take on a far more menacing edge.</p>\n<p>He still doesn\u2019t let go of Stiles\u2019 arm, and Stiles abruptly realizes that he\u2019s being used as a lifesaver. Derek is trying desperately to keep his own humanity, to the point where he\u2019s literally sinking his claws into a human as a means of holding on. Stiles just wishes there was another human around willing to sacrifice their arm to the cause. </p>\n<p>The witch is grinning now, finishing up what Stiles assumes is the last few lines of the gobbledy-gook that she\u2019s been spewing, and suddenly an idea flashes in his mind. <i>Break the circle</i>.</p>\n<p>The circle is made of fire, so Stiles isn\u2019t going to leap through it or anything, but he starts to kick the dirt at his feet onto it, hoping to somehow douse a small part of the flames and break the spell that the witch is spinning. With any luck, it will also break the connection the witch has to the hair-raising amount of sheer <i>power</i> that Stiles can feel all around them.</p>\n<p>He kicks and kicks and finally manages to douse out a small section of the flames. The rest of the circle flickers and then fades into nothing. </p>\n<p>Stiles looks up, triumphant, but the witch is smiling and silent.</p>\n<p>She finished the spell. </p>\n<p>Stiles looks at Derek, whose jaw is still clenched and who is holding himself frighteningly still. Stiles can\u2019t even see the normal rise and fall of his chest, despite how close they\u2019re standing, and he doesn\u2019t even bother trying to pull his arm out of Derek\u2019s grip.</p>\n<p>The witch says, \u201cCome to me,\u201d like that\u2019s some startlingly original command, and Stiles is about to call her out on it when he realizes that Derek isn\u2019t moving.</p>\n<p>The witch frowns. \u201cCome!\u201d she commands, like she\u2019s talking to a disobedient puppy.</p>\n<p>The pain in Stiles\u2019 arm suddenly sharpens, then begins to slowly decrease. He looks down and realizes that Derek\u2019s claws are no longer embedded in his flesh, but rather, he\u2019s dragged them out leaving long, wicked gashes in his wake. </p>\n<p> Derek himself is taking a few slow, menacing steps towards the witch.</p>\n<p>The witch beams. \u201cKill the spare,\u201d she says airily, gesturing towards Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but say. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to quote fucking Voldemort! You are not even approaching his league, sister. You aren\u2019t even Death Eater fodder.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Derek slashes his claws across her throat, and she dies with a faint gurgle.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles gasps, taking a few steps backward. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I mean\u2026 She didn\u2019t even have time for a comeback!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek turns, his eyes still glowing that startling red shade even as his claws and fangs are slowly returning to human. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she finished the spell,\u201d Stiles says. All that power had to go <i>somewhere</i>, but she\u2019d obviously failed at binding Derek\u2019s will to her own.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cYou must have broken the circle in time.\u201d He looks down at the witch\u2019s body. \u201cI don\u2019t think she was a very good witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she pulled you to her,\u201d Stiles says numbly, then looks down. The blood dripping down his arm has formed a muddy puddle beside his feet. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m bleeding on a crime scene. My dad is going to kill me. Or arrest me. Something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes turn human in an instant. \u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe? Mister, this was your doing,\u201d Stiles says, waving his arm around before realizing that was the exact <i>wrong</i> thing to do. \u201cOww,\u201d he manages as he half-falls back down into the dirt, gripping his arm. \u201cSo that\u2019s what hurting like the dickens feels like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek leaves the corpse and crouches by Stiles\u2019 side. He pushes the bloody, tattered sleeve of Stiles\u2019 hoodie up, ignoring Stiles\u2019 extremely dignified whimper of pain, and then <i>sniffs</i> the deep, freely bleeding gouge marks on Stiles\u2019 arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any wolfsbane?\u201d he asks. He sniffs the wound again, then rips off the hoodie\u2019s sleeve and wraps it tightly around it, which Stiles hopes will staunch the bleeding somewhat.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight here in my pocket,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNo. Why the hell would I carry wolfsbane around? My best friend is a werewolf, and I don\u2019t actively hate him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lets out a frustrated breath through his nose. \u201cI have some stashed away. We should treat this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t entirely sure why his boo-boo is more important than the <i>newly created corpse</i> lying in the dirt a few feet away. \u201cUm, isn\u2019t there a murder scene to clean up first?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow. \u201cI have a pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou trust <i>them</i> to clean up a murder scene? One that has my blood all over it?\u201d Stiles asks, but then he remembers what Isaac\u2019s after school job was. \u201cOh wait. Dude, you really put some thought into it, biting a gravedigger. Go you, planning ahead for homicide. That\u2019s not creepy at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives one of his five-yard stares and then roughly helps Stiles to his feet. \u201cCome on. Wolfsbane. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tries really hard to not notice that Derek has left smears of the witch\u2019s blood on Stiles\u2019 hoodie. They blend in with Stiles\u2019 own blood, really. It\u2019s not at all weird or unusual or <i>creepy as hell</i> to have dead witch blood on his outfit.</p>\n<p>Stiles realizes that he\u2019s totally freaking out. Derek is pulling him along back through the woods to his Jeep, and Stiles has a dead girl\u2019s blood on his hoodie and Derek has a dead girl\u2019s blood on his hands from where he killed her and how had Derek known that there was even going to <i>be</i> a witch out in the woods tonight and\u2026</p>\n<p>Stiles did not sign up for this shit. \u201cIf I get arrested for murder, I\u2019m taking you down with me,\u201d he mumbles darkly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen there,\u201d Derek replies, ducking under a low-hanging branch that Stiles just barely manages to dodge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that a joke? Oh my god, you\u2019re joking,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that means that the earth is going to start rotating backwards and we\u2019re all going to go hurtling out into space. Or else Superman logic will kick in and we\u2019ll go backwards in time and I can avoid this whole mess by never following you into the dark woods in the middle of the night, because I clearly should have known better than <i>that</i> --\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you could be louder,\u201d Derek suggests. \u201cJust in case the witch had some accomplices that are going to investigate when they realize the spell went belly-up.\u201d</p>\n<p>That is\u2026 Crap, that\u2019s a really stellar reason to shut up. Stiles tries to hold in all the thoughts that are tumbling through his head, all the ones about how much his arm freaking hurts and also hey, did you have to <i>murder</i> that girl back there, and why didn\u2019t her spell work when Stiles is certain that she finished it before the circle broke.</p>\n<p>Then the witch\u2019s final words, <i>Kill the spare</i>, echo through Stiles\u2019 head, and he has to choke back a hysterical giggle. He stumbles a bit, and Derek\u2019s suddenly there beside him, supporting him with an arm around his shoulders, hissing, \u201cCome on already,\u201d and keeping up the pace.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels more steady, probably because of how he\u2019s pretty sure Derek is made of stone or something, his arms are ridiculously strong, and with Derek\u2019s assistance they make it back to the Jeep far more quickly than it took them to get out to the witch\u2019s circle in the first place.</p>\n<p>Derek takes one look at Stiles, and then starts rifling through Stiles\u2019 pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014hey, bad touch!\u201d Stiles hisses as Derek digs through his pants pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that you clawed the crap out of my arm, do you have to violate me too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek demonstrated his best bitch glare as he pulls out the keys and dangles them in front of Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cYou are in no condition to drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles really isn\u2019t. Still, though\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re going to get murder-blood all over my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you kind of were just under the spell of a wicked witch. Does that count as under the influence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in the fucking car, Stiles.\u201d Derek opens the passenger\u2019s side door and shoves Stiles inside. Stiles sprawls across the passenger seat, of <i>course</i> landing on his wounded arm, and the sharp stab of pain seems to shoot through his entire body. Derek opens the driver\u2019s side door and peers in at Stiles. \u201cAre you dying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope not?\u201d Stiles answers unsteadily. \u201cJesus, what did you <i>do</i> to my arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cI\u2019m still\u2026 there is a lot about being an alpha that doesn\u2019t come instinctively.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles had been a lot happier before he knew that particular nugget of truth. \u201cSo the wolfsbane\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs something I\u2019m hoping will negate the effects of whatever I did to you.\u201d Derek eyes Stiles\u2019 arm. The makeshift bandage is soaked through with blood, and Stiles is doing his very best to pretend like that isn\u2019t extremely worrisome. </p>\n<p>Derek starts the Jeep, and Stiles holds on for dear life as they\u2019re suddenly careening down the road. \u201cOkay, Mr. Drives A Fancy-Pants Sports Car, there\u2019s only so much that my transmission can handle. Also, we\u2019re covered in blood. That\u2019s kind of the textbook example of a time when you obey the rules of the road because we cannot get pulled over right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek eases off the gas the tiniest amount possible, and Stiles counts that as a win. He closes his eyes and tries to concentrate on anything other than his arm, murder, witchcraft or Derek\u2019s driving. Shockingly, despite the fact that none of those topics were in Stiles\u2019 top hundred things to think about four hours ago, suddenly they\u2019re literally the only things he can think of right now.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s reduced to trying to remember what pages he was supposed to read for History when the Jeep jerks to a stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait here,\u201d Derek says, swinging open the door of the Jeep. \u201cI\u2019ll go get the wolfsbane.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. He\u2019s feeling strangely woozy as Derek steps out of the Jeep, and as Derek strides across the parking lot, the pain in his arm intensifies. He leans his head back against the seat and takes a few breaths, but it doesn\u2019t do anything to help. If anything, it gets worse. He stares out through the windshield at Derek, who is standing still partway across the parking lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he impatiently says aloud, hoping that Derek is using his super-hearing. </p>\n<p>Derek takes a few more steps, and then doubles over. </p>\n<p>Stiles immediately scans the area for hunters, assuming Derek has been shot, which\u2026 is probably a worrying first assumption. He doesn\u2019t see anyone, though Derek falls to his knees.</p>\n<p>The pain is no longer centered in his arm, but is radiating through his whole body. He thinks that he might double over, too, if he wasn\u2019t already curled up in the seat.</p>\n<p>Then he realizes that Derek isn\u2019t even trying to move, is just writhing slowly on the ground, and\u2026</p>\n<p>And he hadn\u2019t been hurt at all back in the woods, and it doesn\u2019t make sense that a cut on Stiles\u2019 arm would intensify like this. Stiles stares at the claw marks on his arm. What if\u2026</p>\n<p>What if he's somehow feeling Derek\u2019s pain? Some sort of residue from the spell?</p>\n<p>What if the spell had worked?</p>\n<p>Stiles leans forward and manages to open the door, falling out of the Jeep onto the pavement with a painful thud. He slowly manages to get to his feet, and, stumbling and wavering, makes his way slowly across the parking lot to Derek.</p>\n<p>The closer he gets, the easier it becomes, and by the time he's within an arm\u2019s reach of Derek, Derek himself has stopped writhing and is laying on his back, staring up at the half-moon like it holds the secrets of the universe. Which, maybe for werewolves it does.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe spell worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Derek says. He doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what did it do?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t really want to know the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not tied to the witch,\u201d Derek says slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood thing, especially if death\u2019s catching,\u201d Stiles interjects.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even bother to glare. He sighs. \u201cI think I\u2019m tied to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2026 That isn\u2019t good news at all. \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look impressed.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries again. \u201cSit. Stay. Fetch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t move. \u201cDid you hit your head?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just disproved your theory,\u201d Stiles explains. \u201cWhen the witch bossed you around like a puppy dog, you practically begged for treats. I just got a glare o\u2019doom, ergo, no spells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cThen do me a favor and go get the wolfsbane. It\u2019s in the glove compartment of my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat seems like a really secure place to hide something that\u2019s lethal to you,\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but say, and then starts stumbling towards the creepy abandoned building that Derek is currently using as both garage and house. He\u2019s fine for the first few steps, then a few more, and then there\u2019s a twinging pain in his gut. Now that he\u2019s paying attention, it\u2019s easy to realize it\u2019s completely separate from the pain in his arm. </p>\n<p>He takes a few more steps. It gets worse, and by the time he\u2019s twenty feet away from Derek, the pain is severe enough that he wants to just hunch over and never move again.</p>\n<p>He turns and goes back to where Derek is still staring at the stars, though with a pained expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt appears that we have a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how do we undo it?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI mean, there has to be a safe word or something, right? Something to call off the spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, let\u2019s ask the witch,\u201d Derek snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDo you think that only the witch herself could take it off? Because that\u2019s pretty much the worst thing that could happen to us. Ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually know any witches, and that one\u2019s not going to be talking anytime soon,\u201d Derek says. Stiles suddenly understands why he\u2019s just laying on the concrete like a depressed log. </p>\n<p>Stiles plops down beside him, and wraps his good arm around his knees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be your magical conjoined twin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re not my first choice either,\u201d Derek replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get annoyed and totally kill me,\u201d Stiles says morosely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s probable,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles can\u2019t really tell if he\u2019s joking or not. His face kind of stays the same no matter what mood he\u2019s in. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever thought about becoming a guard for Buckingham Palace?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek actually looks puzzled. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles acknowledges. \u201cI\u2019m just trying really hard to not think about the horrible magical thing that happened to us tonight. Also, I\u2019m a little woozy. Blood loss.\u201d He waves his arm, and a few droplets of blood splatter off onto the concrete.</p>\n<p>That seems to shake Derek out of his post-curse depression. He stands up and helps pull Stiles to his feet, keeping a hand firmly on Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he leads them into his quote-unquote home.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you even <i>have</i> wolfsbane?\u201d Stiles asks, trying to get his mind of the fact that he\u2019s stuck with Derek Hale at his side for the foreseeable future. </p>\n<p>\u201cEnemies.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles admires Derek\u2019s dedication to brevity. Really, he does. Except for how it makes weaseling important information out of him an extremely trying affair. \u201cWhy does my arm need wolfsbane? You never gave Jackson wolfsbane after you clawed his neck up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Jackson\u2019s neck ever do that?\u201d Derek asks, nodding towards Stiles\u2019 arm, which is bloody and puffy and Stiles is pretty sure looks like it\u2019s starting to get infected.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cWhy <i>is</i> it doing that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cNo fucking clue. I\u2019m not really the sort of alpha that tries to draw people under my control\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m not going to become your Renfield,\u201d Stiles blurts out. \u201cAlso, you are exactly that kind of alpha. Or haven\u2019t you met your ragtag team of outcast teens that you decided to bite into superpowerdom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s grip tightens on his shoulder, but thankfully there aren\u2019t claws involved this time. Stiles has had enough with being a werewolf pincushion. \u201cI\u2019m helping them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it just so happens that they increase your power at the same time. Wait. Is that why you don\u2019t even know what you did to me? Are you power-tripping <i>right this second</i>?\u201d Stiles asks. </p>\n<p>Derek pushes open the bay door and doesn\u2019t answer. Stiles stumbles inside, and leans against Derek\u2019s car, maybe smearing a little more blood than necessary on the paint while Derek unlocks it with the key fob and then unlocks the glovebox. He carefully lifts out a manila envelope, and hands it to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s in there,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles fumbles the envelope open with his good hand and then pulls out a baggie of wolfsbane. \u201cYou know, you get arrested way too often to not know better than to stick a plant in a baggie like it\u2019s weed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t dignify that with a response.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I just\u2026 smear it on?\u201d Stiles asks, holding out his arm for Derek to unknot the makeshift bandage.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls the knot apart and nods. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, it should stop the bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty skeptical about this whole thing, but he\u2019s also not fond of bleeding out, so he sprinkles the crumbled wolfsbane on the gashes in his arm. He\u2019s pretty good at dealing with medical emergencies, but looking at the way his own flesh is puckered around the gory wounds is kind of making him queasy, so he looks up at the rafters as he rubs the wolfsbane into the wound.</p>\n<p>It\u2026 it doesn\u2019t hurt like he expects. It\u2019s an odd tingling feeling, kind of like putting aloe on a sunburn. He almost gets a sense of what wolfsbane <i>tastes</i> like, and then\u2026 then it stops tingling.</p>\n<p>His arm is still injured, but the bleeding\u2019s finally stopped. Derek digs around in his car and comes up with a t-shirt, and Stiles uses it to dab at his arm without letting himself think of who or where the t-shirt came from. There were werewolf claws in this wound; anything else won\u2019t really do any worse damage than that. </p>\n<p>His arm seems better, like he\u2019s not going to die of the wound anymore, and he breathes a sigh of thanks.</p>\n<p>Derek seems just as relieved, and Stiles wonders briefly whether or not Derek has any friends of his own as Derek leads him further into the wreck he calls home.</p>\n<p>When Stiles opens his eyes, it\u2019s morning, and Erica Reyes is staring down at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Stiles gasps, fumbling around to try and escape from Erica\u2019s overwhelmingly mean stare. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hit me with car parts, woman!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she replies, smirking. It\u2019s ass o\u2019clock in the morning and she\u2019s already wearing red lipstick. Stiles kind of admires her commitment to badass motion. \u201cFinally decide to run with the big dogs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles says, confused. He looks around. He\u2019s in what is presumably Derek\u2019s living space, a tiny interior room that he presumes was once an office in the warehouse. He\u2019s not sure whether to call it a bedroom or a living room, since there\u2019s a couch and a bed both crammed into it. He\u2019s on the couch, which is scratchy and smells faintly like it came from a dump. \u201cI thought you guys had awesome senses of smell,\u201d he mutters, crinkling his nose at the offending couch before realizing that he smells like he just took a swan dive into garbage himself. Serial killer garbage, since he\u2019s still wearing his bloody hoodie, which, understating matters a bit, is the worse for wear.</p>\n<p>His shoes are caked with what is hopefully mostly mud, and his head is pounding, but his arm is neatly bandaged and the cleanest part of him, so there\u2019s that, at least. And the ache has faded, to the point that Stiles is tempted to peek under the bandage to make sure no miracle healing happened overnight.</p>\n<p>Erica motions towards his arm. \u201cYou take the bite?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles answers immediately. Erica looks skeptical. \u201cTis only a flesh wound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell like Derek,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Stiles realizes belatedly that Derek is actually asleep in the rumpled mess of a bed. He can see a few tufts of hair sticking out from the comforter. Stiles would not have assumed that Derek was one to cocoon himself at night. Granted, if Stiles had given Derek\u2019s sleeping habits any thought, he would have assumed that he slept standing up in various teenagers\u2019 closets or something, given Derek\u2019s true dedication to creeperdom. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat is gross,\u201d he tells her firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t smell me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugs and settles down on the edge of Derek\u2019s bed. It\u2019s only a few feet from the couch, which Stiles supposes is why they were able to sleep last night without feeling hellish levels of magical pain.</p>\n<p>Stiles really misses his life back when the worst thing he had to worry about was embarrassing himself in front of Lydia and keeping himself under the radar at school. If he had a time machine, he would gladly go back and tell himself that, no matter how much of a douche past-Stiles would have thought he was.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why\u2019d Derek kill that girl?\u201d she asks, sounding strangely young, like she\u2019s scared of what the answer is going to be. Stiles realizes suddenly that she knows Derek even less well than he does, and that she really has no idea about the life that she\u2019s jumped headfirst into.</p>\n<p>\u201cWitch,\u201d he says shortly. \u201cTried to turn Derek into her own personal junkyard dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cWitches are real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I know, right?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNext thing you know we\u2019re going to have to worry about pale, sparkly teenagers killing off the deer populations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica actually snorts. \u201cI would be totally pissed if I found out I could have been one of the undead instead. I would look bitchin\u2019 with sparkle-skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to make a possibly ill-advised comment about how glitter does go with Erica\u2019s stripperwear when his phone buzzes loudly. He picks it up, and there are like <i>fourteen</i> missed calls, from both Scott and his dad. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica raises an eyebrow. Stiles wonders if the werewolves actually practice that move in front of the mirror, or if it comes naturally. Maybe he can get Scott to try it. \u201cSo it\u2019s a phone call from daddy that has you worried, not the fact that you\u2019re covered in blood and surrounded by werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks down. \u201cI look like a refugee from Dahmer\u2019s basement.\u201d He tries to pull off the hoodie, but the blood had stiffened and dried overnight and it\u2019s a struggle. Finally, he lets out a muffled, \u201cHelp me!\u201d from inside his stinky cotton tomb, and after a moment that he hopes wasn\u2019t Erica snapping a picture, she pulls off the hoodie and the equally groddy t-shirt that was underneath in one neat motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god that smells vile,\u201d Stiles says. He doesn\u2019t even care that he\u2019s half-naked and smeared with god-knows-what, he\u2019s that thankful to be out of those horrible clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot <i>that</i> bad,\u201d Erica says thoughtfully, holding the gory hoodie between two fingers. \u201cA little off, yeah, but blood.\u201d Her voice takes on a husky, reverent tone. \u201cThere\u2019s something about <i>blood</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two can go be alone if you want,\u201d Stiles says, reluctantly reading the backlog of texts from Scott. He absolutely doesn\u2019t want to know what messages his dad left. He really, really hopes he\u2019s only grounded and isn\u2019t a fugitive. It\u2019s kind of like reading a monologue, where Scott slowly gets frustrated with Stiles\u2019 disappearance, then pissed off, then worried, and finally ending with pleas to not be dead. Stiles is, above all else, an asshole, so he sends a text claiming to be from his ghost about his plans to haunt Scott for the rest of his unnatural life.</p>\n<p>His dad should already be at the station, so he sends another text to him claiming that he got wrapped up in a X-Box session at Scott\u2019s and crashed before realizing his phone had died. It\u2019s the flimsiest imaginable story, but luckily Stiles\u2019 social life is dead enough that his dad should buy it. Score one for loserdom.</p>\n<p>One crisis averted, that just leaves him\u2026 sitting half-naked in a werewolf\u2019s bedroom, with a she-wolf getting all bloodlusty over the dead witch\u2019s blood on his clothes.</p>\n<p>Because that\u2019s Stiles\u2019 life now.</p>\n<p>Erica drops the sweatshirt on the floor suddenly, and Stiles realizes that Derek is stirring. It\u2019s overwhelmingly <i>weird</i> to watch him wake up, sticking his head out of the covers and blinking wearily. His hair is tousled and as he sits up, Derek rubs at his eyes. Stiles is shocked by how unthreatening he looks. He wouldn\u2019t say innocent, Derek could never pull that particular look off, but he doesn\u2019t look as thoroughly predatory as he normally does.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s strangely endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d Erica chirps, because she possibly has a death wish. </p>\n<p>Derek growls in her direction, and she takes the hint and hops off his bed. \u201cIs it taken care of?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe and Isaac stashed her in a fresh grave,\u201d Erica says proudly, like a kid showing off a clever trick. \u201cNo one\u2019ll ever know she\u2019s in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t actually give her a gold star, though Stiles kind of hoped that he would. \u201cDid you salt it like I asked?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica nods. \u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, that was a <i>danger</i>?\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but ask. Seriously, though. Witches and werewolves are one thing, zombies quite another. </p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Derek says. It\u2019s not as reassuring as he probably intends.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cJeez, this whole expedition just keeps turning into a barrel of laughs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica turns to Derek. \u201cDo you need me to do anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that Erica leaves, like every issue she has with authority disappears in the face of Derek\u2019s alphaness. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of rude. And creepy,\u201d Stiles offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Derek seems genuinely puzzled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole, you know, Bossing people around thing. And them obeying. It\u2019s creepy, especially from people who try to look like The Outsiders.\u201d Stiles waves his hands around nervously. Now that Erica isn\u2019t there being a big flashing red distraction, Stiles is forced to remember that he\u2019s magically bound to Derek. And that they\u2019re going to have to have a lot of one-on-one time.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s also uncomfortably aware of how much he has to pee, which\u2026 he surreptitiously looks around for a bathroom. There\u2019s no way that the whole bathroom experience is going to be anything but weird and uncomfortable, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly unavoidable. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Derek says, yawning. He stretches his arms, and Stiles can\u2019t help but watch because dude, how many muscles does the man <i>have</i>. Stiles feels woefully inadequate and wishes that he had a shirt to put on. </p>\n<p>Stiles glances in the direction that Erica disappeared in, but she apparently has left the building altogether, so he figures it\u2019s safe enough to talk. \u201cSo, um. Do we check to see if the spell faded overnight? Maybe a good night\u2019s rest is all that it takes to break it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It turns out that Derek <i>isn\u2019t</i> too dignified to roll his eyes. Interesting. \u201cSearing pain isn\u2019t how I like to start my mornings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for hoping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs and climbs out of bed. He\u2019s just wearing a pair of boxer-briefs. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t have to sleep in gross bloody clothes?\u201d Stiles kind of regrets the question immediately, since he realizes he\u2019s asking why Derek didn\u2019t rip the clothes off his unconscious body. Really, he should be happy that he retained his dignity for as long as he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I did good to fix up your arm,\u201d Derek points out. \u201cI was kind of out of it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cValid point,\u201d Stiles acknowledges, thankful for the easy out. \u201cSo how are we going to play this? Who is going to be whose duckling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more concerned with who gets the first shower,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI vote me, since it\u2019s my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shower here?\u201d Stiles asks, looking around. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s safe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glowers. </p>\n<p>\u201cKidding! Kidding!\u201d Stiles says, holding his hands out to proclaim his innocence. \u201cYou\u2019ve moved up in the world! This place actually has all of its original walls.\u201d</p>\n<p>One day he\u2019s going to learn to control his mouth, and that day is going to be awesome. Except for how he\u2019s never going to survive being magically bound to Derek Hale. He\u2019s going to drive him right over the edge, and then he\u2019s going to be werewolf-chow.</p>\n<p>Derek responds like a fourth-grader and pushes Stiles down as he passes. Stiles bounces harmlessly on the couch cushions, true, but he\u2019s actually a little grateful that Derek isn\u2019t operating completely on his own age level. It evens things out a little if they\u2019re both dumbasses.</p>\n<p>He starts to feel a twinge in his gut when Derek gets a few strides away, so he quickly follows Derek. He realizes belatedly that he\u2019s cast himself as the duckling, but there\u2019s no helping it. Derek knows where the bathroom is, and Stiles both wants to wash last night\u2019s chaos off him and also needs to pee a lot.</p>\n<p>The bathroom is surprisingly decent, and Stiles saves himself some embarrassing moments by assuming that they\u2019re working on locker room rules, and focuses on emptying his bladder and then taking off his super gross shoes instead of thinking about Derek Hale going about his morning shower rituals four feet away from Stiles. It\u2019s all strangely intimate, and Stiles is starting to realize the worst part of this curse might not be Derek\u2019s reaction to Stiles\u2019 smartass remarks, but rather the fact that they\u2019re going to get all kinds of up close and personal with each other.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t exactly the solitary sort, not like Derek obviously is, but the thought of having absolutely no private time whatsoever is daunting. It dawns on him suddenly that that means no <i>private Stiles-on-Stiles time</i> either, and yeah. This is going to be super fun. He\u2019s going to write online recommendations that everyone get magically attached to brooding stupidly attractive werewolves who can smell your moods. </p>\n<p>The water cuts off, and Stiles shakes away the increasingly horrifying thoughts he\u2019s having in favor of helpfully handing Derek a towel. Then he squirms out of his own gross pants and steps into the still-steamy shower. The hot water feels like <i>heaven</i>, and the water pressure is <i>amazing</i>, and Stiles lets out an appreciative moan and calls out, \u201cDude, I\u2019m going to marry your shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t reply; Stiles doesn\u2019t stick his head out of the curtain to find out what sort of glare he\u2019s getting. He\u2019s too happy just letting the water beat away at his sore muscles.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t realize how grimy he really was until he sees the rusty-colored water sluicing off his body, and he does his best to scrub himself down one-handed while keeping his bandaged arm as dry as possible. He has the feeling he doesn\u2019t want to wash out the wolfsbane just yet. </p>\n<p>He stumbles a bit trying to scrub his left foot, but manages to catch himself with the shower curtain before actually falling. By a minor miracle the curtain doesn\u2019t give, and Stiles decides to give up on the wondrously private world of the shower before he destroys something.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not giving you a hand,\u201d Derek says from the other side of the curtain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good, I\u2019m good,\u201d Stiles quickly says. \u201cNot all of us have supernatural agility. Just give me a towel, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles quickly dries off and emerged from the shower decently clad in one of Derek\u2019s surprisingly plush towels. \u201cDo you just spend all your rent money on housewares?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m laying low,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cThere are hunters squatting in my house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour burnt-up shell of a house,\u201d Stiles corrects. \u201cI try not to judge, but dude, how much did you pay to not have that thing condemned?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him the stink-eye.</p>\n<p>Stiles decides to concentrate on putting pants on. Then he follows Derek back to his room, where Derek opens an actual <i>trunk</i> and pulls out some clothes. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this werewolf Hogwarts?\u201d Stiles has never seen anyone actually <i>use</i> a trunk for their clothes before.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d Derek throws him a shirt. It\u2019s a dark t-shirt that probably looks totally badass on Derek, but when Stiles pulls it on it\u2019s just kind of baggy and boring. Then Derek shares some pop-tarts with Stiles, which proves that deep down he\u2019s probably a decent person. Indecent people hoard their pop-tarts.</p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s what Stiles tells Derek as he devours his breakfast. </p>\n<p>Derek just tells him he\u2019ll keep that in mind. Stiles hopes that he hasn\u2019t planted seeds of pop-tart hoarding in Derek\u2019s mind, because that would totally bite.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the awkward business of cleaning Stiles\u2019 Jeep up enough that it\u2019s not a rolling murder conviction. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully as he scrubs a dried blood smear off the steering wheel, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to worry that my Jeep might develop bloodlust.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, so Stiles sees that as an opening to express his many concerns about how much violence had entered his Jeep\u2019s life lately and how it was worrisome and perhaps he find some healthy outlet for the Jeep to work through its issues.</p>\n<p>Derek isn\u2019t amused, even though Stiles was being totally subtle. He is magically tied to the dude now, after all. He kind of wants him to be mentally stable, which has always been something that Derek doesn\u2019t seem to have a solid grip on. See: his fairly epic trust issues.</p>\n<p>Though Stiles is not touching those with a ten-foot pole. Derek will just bring up all the things Stiles did when they first met that possibly ruined Derek\u2019s life, and while Stiles feels sort of bad about wrongly accusing the guy of murder and digging up his sister\u2019s corpse and whatnot, he\u2019s really not prepared to like\u2026 talk about it or anything. </p>\n<p>So he just shuts the hell up (meaning he sticks to inconsequential chatter instead of pointed, Jeep-personifying chatter) and is somewhat relieved when they manage to leave Derek\u2019s warehouse of werewolves without any more run-ins with Derek\u2019s pack.</p>\n<p>Stiles just sometimes feels like there are <i>too many</i> supernatural creatures in his life, and doesn\u2019t really want to have to explain about the curse yet. Probably eventually it\u2019ll come up, when people realize he and Derek <i>never leave each other\u2019s presence</i>, but for right now, Stiles is still kind of hoping the spell will just magically dissipate. Like, it even makes sense. What kind of bullshit is magic if it even works after the caster is dead? Stiles is like ninety-nine percent sure that Disney movies didn\u2019t work that way, and he finds it\u2019s still disappointing that his life doesn\u2019t operate on the rules set out for him in childhood.</p>\n<p>Stiles insists on driving today, because he\u2019s totally over the horrible injury of the night before. It\u2019s a blatant lie \u2013 he\u2019s barely holding onto normal, over here \u2013 but Derek doesn\u2019t call him out on it. </p>\n<p>Derek directs them back to the scene of last night\u2019s murder, which\u2026 Stiles is kind of freaked out by how <i>not</i> freaked out he is. The woods are still abandoned, and Stiles can\u2019t even see any sign of Isaac and Erica\u2019s clean up, which frankly is more than he would have expected from them. He\u2019s still maybe a little bitter about Erica\u2019s treatment of his Jeep. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan here?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI mean. Didn\u2019t we kind of go above and beyond with the fact-finding last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to know as much as possible about the spell,\u201d Derek says, actually volunteering information. It\u2019s novel. \u201cSo that we can know what it was and how to break it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know any witches?\u201d Stiles is pretty sure that Derek is exactly the type to attract witches. \u201cMeet any at a Creature Feature Mixer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitches don\u2019t like werewolves,\u201d Derek says like it\u2019s brand new information.</p>\n<p>\u201cCaught onto that one last night,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cKind of looked like it was mutual dislike. But you seem the sort to indulge in some forbidden romance\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty glad that Derek hasn\u2019t yet developed laser vision. Though if that\u2019s an alpha power that\u2019s going to eventually make an appearance, Stiles is screwed. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek says instead, and drags Stiles out of the Jeep by his shirt collar.</p>\n<p>Stiles stumbles along after him, grateful that at least it\u2019s daylight now. The hike to the scene of last night\u2019s witch killing takes less time than Stiles would have thought. Then Derek pokes around the remains of the witch\u2019s circle. Somehow there isn\u2019t a single char mark from the fire, which Stiles assumes is because of magic, but it\u2019s pretty fucking surreal. Instead, the only sign of the circle is the rough line sketched out in the dirt, though even that has scuff marks across it. Stiles thinks that someone stumbling onto this clearing wouldn\u2019t even notice it, even though the image of the circle is seared in Stiles\u2019 mind.</p>\n<p> Derek takes out a pad of paper and starts sketching things. Normally Stiles would look around himself and do some investigating, but all that\u2019s left is a few suspiciously placed rocks and a few drops of candlewax, and a scraped-up area where Isaac and Erica clearly did some landscaping to hide the bloody spots, and Stiles\u2019 heart just isn\u2019t into it.</p>\n<p>Finding another witch seems way more important. Stiles is pretty sure that they saw all that there was to see last night, and this is just wasting time that could be spent fixing the problem.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s started to wander off until the uncomfortable feeling in his gut turns into full-blown agony, and he stumbles backwards until it fades. </p>\n<p>Derek helps him to his feet. \u201cI figure, there\u2019s no pain for about six feet, then bearable pain up to about ten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a magical choker chain,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cThis is the <i>worst</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just looks at him with that sad fucking Batman <i>my parents are dead</i> look, and just, no.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, don\u2019t even bring up your tragic backstory here,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to be upset about being tied to a pretty rude werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a basket of kittens,\u201d Derek says. Stiles is momentarily taken aback that Derek can even think of kittens while looking that grim.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am pretty fucking adorable,\u201d Stiles says, because why not.</p>\n<p>Derek just shoves him lightly on the shoulder and escorts him back to the car. Then Stiles is kind of lost, because he has no clue what to do with his time when there\u2019s a Derek Hale in tow. At least Derek seems equally at a loss.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know anything about magic?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cNothing that seems helpful right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Stiles says. He thinks a minute. \u201cAre there any like\u2026 supernatural hang-outs? Super secret clubs where we could find a coven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I want to hang out in a club with people who can magically control me?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand any of your life choices,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cIt seemed right up your self-destructive alley.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him an incredulous look. \u201cYou know who else hangs out in a self-destructive alley? A human who constantly sticks his nose into werewolf pack business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Scott\u2019s self-elected Watcher,\u201d Stiles says stiffly. \u201cYou\u2019ve met him. He\u2019d be lost without me. And probably dead. Lying in a ditch, for sure. Just like certain other werewolves that shall not be named.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t actually refute him, though he\u2019s practically rolling his eyes. </p>\n<p>So Stiles switches tactics. \u201cWhat about Allison? Maybe she\u2019s learned about witches during her hunter lessons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me go through my channels first,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s channels suck.</p>\n<p>First he makes a bunch of phone calls. Stiles is impressed by how little he speaks when on the phone, where his glower has no effect. Suspiciously little, really. Stiles wonders if Derek is even talking to real people. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem to get him anywhere, though. So as Derek snips monosyllabically at people who may or may not exist, Stiles pulls out his phone and googles magic shops in the Beacon Hills area.</p>\n<p>He gets more results than he would have assumed, though he quickly realizes that more of the results have to do with sex shops or birthday magicians than witchy hangouts. </p>\n<p>Then he notices a book store called the Crescent Moon, and after going to the site, decides it\u2019s probably their best bet. </p>\n<p>Derek is glaring at his contacts list like it\u2019s going to cough up the name and number of a witch, which, Stiles acknowledges, considering how many lady names he can see, might actually be plausible. But he pokes him on the shoulder and says, \u201cFound a magic store, and it\u2019s only half an hour away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise\u2026\u201d Derek begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re not going to go in announcing you\u2019re a werewolf and need help removing a dead witch\u2019s spell,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cThey sell books. We can buy some. Do the research montage thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look happy about it, but half an hour later they pull up to the Crescent Moon. \u201cYou do the talking,\u201d he says shortly as they climb out of the Jeep.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan do.\u201d Stiles does a little finger-gun action in Derek\u2019s direction, which he doesn\u2019t even have the decency to return.</p>\n<p>Stiles basically regrets suggesting coming to a witch shop as soon as they open the door. Even though he\u2019s hardly going to <i>tell</i> anyone Derek is a werewolf, he sometimes forgets what Derek looks like. Which is pretty much like some sort of predator. For god\u2019s sake, he\u2019s wearing a leather jacket into a store populated by vegans. This is a disaster.</p>\n<p>So he leads the way into the shelves, Derek following close behind, looking around in that shady way of his, and Stiles kind of wants to bang his head on the closest pile of gardening books. The counter and the small coffee bar next to it are populated by a mismatched group of people who range the spectrum from hippie to hipster, and they\u2019re all watching Stiles and Derek like hawks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow do I feel conspicuous right now,\u201d Stiles whispers.</p>\n<p>Derek somehow manages to <i>not</i> say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles explores the bookshelves for a few minutes, looking for some sort of spellbook. He doesn\u2019t actually expect it to be leatherbound and five hundred years old, but he\u2019s still taken aback when he finds the proper shelf and it\u2019s filled with shiny new, independent-press trade paperbacks. He picks one up and flips through it. Nothing\u2019s impossible to decipher like the Argent family bestiary, but this is in comic sans, which is a whole different sort of terror.</p>\n<p>\u201cA spellbook,\u201d Stiles says slowly, staring at the book in his hands, \u201cthat is written in comic sans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it have an index?\u201d Derek pulls another book from the shelf and flips to the back.</p>\n<p>\u201cJudging from it, this one is all about love spells,\u201d Stiles says, skimming the index for anything that might help. \u201cA few of which are more disturbing than others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Derek turn at the same time. One of the older women from the counter is standing there, smiling and clasping her hands in front of herself. Stiles is immediately suspicious, because no one working retail is that zen-looking.</p>\n<p>So Stiles decides to just go for it and lie through his teeth. \u201cYes! This is super embarrassing, but my cousin here lost his girlfriend\u2019s book, and we wanted to get some sort of replacement for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat book was it?\u201d the shopkeeper asks. Her name tag identifies her as Sage, which Stiles has to assume is some sort of self-assumed identity. He\u2019s well versed in terrible names, but at least his mother didn\u2019t randomly point to a spice rack for his name.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing. We have no clue,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cBut we do know it was about casting spells, and we thought if we got some sort of replacement, it might soften the blow when she finds out hers is gone. So maybe just a basic book about how magic works? Magical theory, beginning spellcasting. Something along those lines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you want a beginner\u2019s book to witchcraft,\u201d Sage says, sounding matronly and helpful. Stiles is ninety percent sure that means the jig is up. \u201cFor his girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even bother to nod. Just stands there with a level-ten creepy look on his face, like he\u2019s a second away from biting heads off. </p>\n<p>Stiles presumes that means Sage is a witch. So he plows ahead. \u201cYeah.\u201d He waves the love spell book around. \u201cSomething more helpful than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sage smiles. \u201cAre you looking for something like Dungeons and Dragons? We have a small selection of roleplay game books two aisles over\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nudges him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is very helpful,\u201d Stiles lies. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And they follow Sage to the fantasy aisle. She leaves them, and Derek hisses, \u201cOut of here. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Stiles has a weird crawly feeling on the back of his neck. </p>\n<p>He peeks around the end of the aisle. There\u2019s a crowd around the counter now, all arranging things with a single-mindedness that lets Stiles know that shit is about to go down.</p>\n<p>He scampers across the store, Derek close behind him, and slides gratefully into his Jeep. He realizes he\u2019s still holding the love spell book and drops it in the floorboard. He struggles to get the keys out of his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo!\u201d Derek snaps. \u201cCan\u2019t you <i>feel</i> that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles definitely feels something, though he was hoping it was just his own fear. Derek\u2019s glinting red eyes tell him that it\u2019s definitely magic, though. He finally gets the keys out and shoves them in the ignition, the engine thankfully turning over on the first try. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to slam into reverse and get the hell out of dodge when someone bangs on his window. He looks up and it\u2019s one of the hipster girls from inside, eyes wide and glancing nervously back to the Crescent Moon, like she was the one the witches were about to curse. Again.</p>\n<p>Derek urges him to go, but there\u2019s something about the girl that makes Stiles roll down his window. She looks far too nervous to be doing this under the command of the other witches.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the ones,\u201d she says. \u201cThe ones who took out Thea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, no clue what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Stiles says, because he\u2019s not dumb.</p>\n<p>She shakes her head, and says, \u201cShe lost her mind. They all have. They\u2019re listening to\u2026. I can\u2019t even get into it. But she did something, didn\u2019t she? Before she died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill in the dark here,\u201d Stiles says to maintain plausible deniability, though his heart isn\u2019t fully into it. He glances back at Derek, who is staring out the passenger window in a vain attempt to hide that he is on the verge of wolfing out. Stiles notices that his claws are visible, and gestures for the girl to hurry to her point already.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d she says, shoving a book through the window. Stiles fumbles with it as she says, \u201cThere\u2019s some dark shit happening with the coven, and Thea was at the center of it. Watch your backs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you reverse spells?\u201d Stiles asks quickly, because hey, a witch is right there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou? Don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cThe caster has to reverse it, or else her coven.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which is pretty much the worst possible answer she could have given. \u201cRight. What if---\u201c</p>\n<p>The girl\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cGo! Now! It\u2019s about to---\u201c</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t wait around to hear what terrible magical thing is going to happen. He slams on the gas, and puts some arcade-gleaned knowledge to use as he spins the wheel and fishtails out of the parking lot like a bat out of hell.</p>\n<p>The tingling he felt in the magic shop intensifies, but Stiles doesn\u2019t let off the gas. </p>\n<p>\u201cFaster, faster,\u201d chants Derek, and if Stiles wasn\u2019t practically jumping out of his seat in terror, he would have snipped that Derek\u2019s car would have been of more use in a high-speed fleeing situation.</p>\n<p>The Crescent Moon disappears from the rear-view mirror as he sped down the road, and he spits out, \u201cHow far a radius does magic have, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this far,\u201d Derek growls. Actually growls, because he\u2019s shifted. Stiles momentarily thanks the powers that be that Derek hasn\u2019t gone full alpha-mode on him, and keeps the engine gunned.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles mutters, and runs a red light. The strange feel of magic is starting to fade, now that the Crescent Moon is out of sight, and Stiles prays that he isn\u2019t the victim of another nasty new curse.</p>\n<p>Derek is panting, and gripping the dash in an alarming manner. \u201cHey, hey,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin my interior. This thing is <i>original</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek growls at him, but it isn\u2019t a howl or a roar <i>and</i> he lets go of the dash, so Stiles counts it as a win. Another minute down the road and Stiles can no longer feel the prickling sensation of magic, so he slows down enough that he won\u2019t automatically lose his license if a cop spots him.</p>\n<p>When they get back to Beacon Hills, Stiles automatically drives to his own house, because hanging around the pack makes him nervous. Derek doesn\u2019t comment on his choice of location, just gathers up the magic books and, after confirming that the Sheriff wasn\u2019t home, heads inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey recognized us,\u201d Derek snaps once they\u2019re safely ensconced in Stiles\u2019 room. \u201cHow did they recognize us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens the bag of chips he grabbed on the way up and shoves a handful in his mouth. \u201cIn retrospect, we look shady as fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wags his still-bandaged arm as evidence, and then gestures to Derek\u2019s everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly have \u2018werewolf\u2019 tattooed on my forehead,\u201d Derek snips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might as well, buddy,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, at least to witches, who I presume know about the other creatures that go bump in the night. You kind of have this aura going on. A kind of \u2018I\u2019ll happily eat your face off under the light of the full moon\u2019 kind of deal. It\u2019s menacing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek actually looks kind of disappointed to hear that he has the aura of a serial killer. Stiles always kind of assumed that was what he was going for. \u201cAnd what the hell were they doing with all that magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood question.\u201d Stiles picks up the book the good witch had given them and waves it at Derek. \u201cI\u2019m guessing this holds a clue or two, though. Glinda back there risked life and limb to give it to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr else she wanted us to think she was risking herself and instead was doing the coven\u2019s bidding,\u201d Derek points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you have serious trust issues?\u201d Stiles really prefers to not live in constant paranoia, but now that Derek has raised the issue he can\u2019t help but wonder about it. \u201cDid she\u2026 smell trustworthy? You lot can smell stuff like that, right? Like dogs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Derek says, because nothing ever is.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Derek actually looks frustrated, and he runs his hands through his hair. \u201cEveryone\u2019s different. It\u2019s like\u2026 like body language. When you know someone well, it\u2019s obvious. When they\u2019re a stranger, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just one of their quirks or not. Some things are universal, but there\u2019s a lot of room for error.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says. It kind of sounds like Derek is as lost as he is. Which is bad. Very bad. Stiles was kind of counting on Derek to have some sort of innate Alpha-knowledge that got them out of this mess. He probably should have realized that Derek was as in over his head as Stiles was around the time that Derek willingly agreed to go to a <i>magic shop</i>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a terrifying thought. Stiles intellectually <i>knows</i> that Derek is new at being alpha and that he\u2019s on his own, but somehow Stiles assumed that there was some sort of secret handbook or something that Derek has been working from. But he doesn\u2019t even know what Derek\u2019s relationship with his sister was, for all that Stiles had to do with the shit that went down for Derek after her death. He\u2019s assuming it wasn\u2019t that great, given that they lived on opposite sides of the country. From what Scott\u2019s told him Derek spent a lot of time talking <i>at</i> Peter Hale, but Peter never talked back.</p>\n<p>If only Derek would stop making those terrifying faces at him all the time, it would be a lot easier to remember that he\u2019s a young guy trying to keep his chin above water that\u2019s way too deep for him. </p>\n<p>Probably that\u2019s <i>why</i> he makes the terrifying faces, really.</p>\n<p>So Stiles awkwardly flips through the book. It\u2019s not as flashy as the love potions book, in that instead of being a cheap trade paperback it\u2019s spiral-bound and clearly printed in someone\u2019s basement, kind of like the cookbooks his dad keeps buying from the school board.</p>\n<p>At first glance he almost thinks it <i>is</i> a cookbook, but then he realizes that he\u2019s looking at spells, all neatly set out in steps, with lists of required herbs, candles and moon phases neatly listed at the top of each page.</p>\n<p>So he turns to the front of the book, half-hoping for a quick lesson in magical theory, but no such luck. There\u2019s just a generic thank-you page and a list of contributors. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was her name again?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhose?\u201d Derek is sitting in his chair, broodily staring at the carpet. Stiles wants to offer him a book or video game or something, but he tries to keep his focus on the book.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witch from last night. The girl today mentioned it.\u201d Stiles tries to remember. \u201cTina?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThea,\u201d Derek says after a moment.</p>\n<p>Stiles waves the book in front of him. \u201cLook at this. The fourth contributor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThea Rookwood,\u201d Derek reads aloud. He looks up at Stiles excitedly. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly one way to find out!\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles really should know by this point in his life that optimism is <i>always</i> misplaced. There was no handy index telling which witch contributed which spell, and the spells themselves are labeled in some sort of bastardized Latin that Google translate refuses to decipher.</p>\n<p>Plus he and Derek both want to read the book, so they end up shoulder-to-shoulder on the floor, leaning back against Stiles\u2019 bed. While Stiles has been slowly adjusting to having Derek around all the time, this is much more intimate. It puts Stiles directly in Derek\u2019s personal bubble, which he\u2019s definitely not as comfortable with as he should be, given all the times they\u2019ve been thrown together. For instance, the hours in a freaking swimming pool together. He still keeps expecting Derek to slam him into a wall.</p>\n<p>Apparently he expects it enough to have built up a reflexive reaction, he discovers the second time he flinches when Derek reaches to turn a page.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you stop that?\u201d Derek asks after the fourth page-turn. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hit you. Probably.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent a lot of time physically intimidating me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get you to help me,\u201d Derek says, which\u2026 is pretty fucking bleak.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsking nicely works pretty good,\u201d Stiles offers.</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, okay,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our rocky moments. But I\u2019ve saved your life, you\u2019ve saved mine. We\u2019re practically buddies. We haven\u2019t made it into bro-territory yet, but we\u2019re definitely within the realm of favor-asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>He punctuates this with a shoulder-nudge, though he immediately regrets it and waits for Derek to growl at him.</p>\n<p>Instead Derek just looks down, picking at a loose thread on his jeans. It\u2019s the most unguarded Stiles has ever seen him, and he bites his lip, trying to keep himself from saying something dumb. Derek saves him, though, by speaking up. \u201cSorry if I\u2019ve\u2026 frightened you.\u201d</p>\n<p>What the fuck is Stiles supposed to say to that? \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about being frightened! You are the least frightening monster I know, and I\u2019m including Scott on that list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did say I can scent emotions, you know.\u201d There\u2019s the slightest hint of a smile on Derek\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries not to mentally run through the list of embarrassing things Derek probably knows about him if he\u2019s been sniffing out his emotions. He fails pretty spectacularly. \u201cWell you haven\u2019t been using your superpowers properly then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him the side-eye, but Stiles holds his manly ground and pretends like Derek definitely can\u2019t tell anything about his emotions right now. Werewolves suck. </p>\n<p>He wonders how one translates that sentiment into scent-able emotions. </p>\n<p>Then Derek does something weird. He grabs Stiles\u2019s arm and <i>sniffs</i> at the bandage there.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. Derek turns his arm, fingers curling in hard against Stiles\u2019 skin, and Stiles tries his best to not squirm. Derek then leans in close, nose almost pressing against the bandage, and breathes in deep, his head tilted in such a way that his lips brush against the tender, sensitive skin on the inside of Stiles\u2019 elbow.</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to say something, some comment about taking the sniffing thing too far or something, but he\u2019s stuck just trying his best not to squirm his arm away as Derek molests it.</p>\n<p>He also really, really hopes that Derek is doing some sort of werewolf thing about the claw marks and that he\u2019s ignoring the whole emotion-sniffing thing, because things could get awkward <i>fast</i>. The tingles from the touch of Derek\u2019s skin against his, the feel of his breath and lips against him, seem to shoot straight to his dick, and Stiles is having a hard time keeping his breath even.</p>\n<p>After another long moment, Derek loosens his grip on Stiles\u2019 arm and pulls back. Stiles takes a few deep breaths before he figures he\u2019s okay to talk without saying something too idiotic. \u201cThe hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes a werewolf can mark a human,\u201d Derek says. He\u2019s still staring at Stiles\u2019 arm, and he starts to slowly unwind the bandage to reveal the claw marks he left the night before. </p>\n<p>\u201cLike what you did to Jackson?\u201d Stiles can\u2019t look away from his arm. The marks somehow look worse half-healed, like all the blood from the previous night \u2013 too much blood, he thinks now, seeing that the marks aren\u2019t severe enough to have needed stitches or anything \u2013 but there\u2019s a savagery about them, the way they rake across his pale skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt forges a connection,\u201d Derek says. He traces a claw mark with a completely human fingertip, but Stiles flinches anyway. His arm doesn\u2019t hurt the way it <i>should</i>, given how fresh it is, but Derek\u2019s touch against it feels horribly <i>raw</i>.</p>\n<p>And Stiles gets it. \u201cThe wolfsbane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe connection would have gone much deeper, since I\u2019m the alpha,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure I would have wanted to break it, once it was in place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says. Derek isn\u2019t saying what kind of connection it would have forged, but Stiles has read pretty much everything the internet has to offer about werewolves. He thinks again about last night, about Derek\u2019s hand possessively curled around his arm, and wonders exactly how that would have changed the bond Derek created. </p>\n<p>Jackson got Derek\u2019s nightmares when Derek clawed him, and that was when Derek was a beta. Stiles thinks that a possessive alpha marking someone probably had a lot more intense repercussions.</p>\n<p>What those could have been, Stiles really doesn\u2019t want to think about. Not when he\u2019s shoulder-to-shoulder with Derek, his knee pressed lightly against Derek\u2019s leg, and Derek\u2019s hand still curved loosely around Stiles\u2019 arm. The witch\u2019s spell is bad, but they both want to break it.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t think he would have been able to break a hold that Derek had over him, and the thought sends a cold shiver up his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure it would work,\u201d Derek admits. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that it did, though. I don\u2019t think you would be intimidated by me if you were marked as mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really appreciate that it did.\u201d Stiles stares at his arm like he\u2019s never seen it before. \u201cReally appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lets go of his arm and turns another page in the spellbook. This one appears to have some effect on how the witch sees the world, and Stiles thinks it might have something to do with ghosts, which is wicked awesome but supremely unhelpful for their current predicament.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder if anyone can do magic,\u201d he muses.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witches don\u2019t seem to think so, judging by spellbook. It seems to require some special gift.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t look up from the book. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s trying to pull himself in, like he just revealed too much about himself and has to be stoic so that Stiles doesn\u2019t accidentally start to think of him as a person.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s kind of a little late for that, so Stiles pokes him in the side. Derek jumps a little, and glares. Stiles makes a face at him, hoping to reassure him that Stiles isn\u2019t repulsed by him or whatever Derek\u2019s hang up with any level of opening up is.</p>\n<p>Derek just shakes his head, though he hasn\u2019t like, tried to move away or yell at Stiles or shove him against a wall, so that\u2019s progress, really.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe know nothing about the enemy here. Sun Tzu would be rolling his eyes at us so hard, dude. So we need to figure some shit out. Like magic, for instance. Is it a superpower, or can it be learned, or do witches bite each other to spread the magic\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to guess they don\u2019t bite each other,\u201d Derek says wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, it works for werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitches are not werewolves.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou really are one of the great thinkers of our time.\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help it. He has zero brain to mouth filter. It\u2019s probably going to be his cause of death. Maybe he should write a pre-emptive letter to the coroner so it can be explained to his dad.</p>\n<p>Derek smacks up lightly upside the head. \u201cYou know what I mean. And I don\u2019t know. There were a few witches that my family trusted, back\u2026 when. But I wasn\u2019t really involved in anything. They were women, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s exclusive. Older, but we saw last night that witches can gain powers young.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t remember the witches\u2019 names?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have mentioned it if I had,\u201d Derek says sweetly.</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his hands up. \u201cJust checking, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer, just cocks his head the same way Scott does when he\u2019s just notices something outside the range of human senses.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s home.\u201d Derek sounds calm. Stiles remembers him saying he\u2019d been exonerated, but he knows perfectly well that if he was a person of interest, the last place he\u2019d want to be found was in the bedroom of the sheriff\u2019s son.</p>\n<p>Which sounds way dirtier thought out like that than it feels sitting here. Fuck, the last thing Stiles needs is to think about is Derek and anything illicit involving bedrooms. He\u2019s magically handcuffed to the guy. He absolutely cannot be thinking about the stupidly hot way his lips grazed against his skin earlier.</p>\n<p>Stiles jumps up way faster than necessary, knocking the spellbook out of Derek\u2019s hands and pacing, antsy, around the room a bit.</p>\n<p>Derek calmly stands up and moves to his customary hiding spot just behind Stiles\u2019 bedroom door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is so creepy that you already have a hiding spot in my room,\u201d Stiles says. He follows it up with, \u201cI so need a girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure his face has never been redder, but Derek just laughs and leans against the wall, looking as relaxed as Stiles has ever seen him. It sends a weird pang through Stiles\u2019 heart, hearing Derek laugh, and Stiles freezes for a moment, just staring, mouth parted like an idiot.</p>\n<p>Derek just stares at him, eyes flickering down to Stiles\u2019 mouth, probably wondering what he did in life to end up stuck with a mouthbreather. </p>\n<p>That leaves Stiles lurking nervously next to the door when his dad finally knocks and peeks his head in, which he\u2019s sure his dad doesn\u2019t miss. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun at Scott\u2019s?\u201d his dad asks, pushing open the door and leaning against the frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cLots,\u201d Stiles replies. He shifts a little, and his dad gives him a look that Stiles knows perfectly well means that he is not being nearly as stealthy as he thinks.</p>\n<p>Though, really, Stiles can see a former murder suspect from here and his dad can\u2019t, so he\u2019s being pretty stealthy. All things considered.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta ask you to stay in tonight,\u201d his dad finally says. \u201cThere\u2019s a college girl gone missing nearby, and we\u2019ve got the squad out combing the woods. I know normally you think it\u2019s a hoot to come see what the fuss is about, but\u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cWhat the hell happened to your arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy arm?\u201d Stiles says blankly. The offending limb just hangs there, displaying claw marks for the whole world -- and more direly, his father -- to see. \u201cI was picking blackberries? And the thorns, man. They say every rose has got one, but blackberries have more than a few.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlackberries,\u201d his dad repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBlackberries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you find this\u2026 blackberry bush?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that his dad practices his interrogation techniques on him. \u201cScott\u2019s yard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d his dad says slowly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can take you to it,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cYou could shoot it. Defend the family honor. No vegetation shall fell a Stilinski!\u201d He shakes a fist at the nonexistent blackberry bush.</p>\n<p>His dad gives him a fond look and then pulls him in for a hug. </p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re entertaining,\u201d he says, clapping Stiles\u2019 back. He releases him, and holds him by the shoulders for a moment. \u201cAnd you know you can talk about anything to me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says, feeling like shit. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d his dad replies. \u201cRemember. Keep your ass in this house. You\u2019ve been in enough trouble lately. I don\u2019t want to have to drag you away from yet another crime scene.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScout\u2019s honor,\u201d Stiles says, throwing up a Vulcan salute, which makes his dad laugh. He leaves with another pointed, \u201cStay in!\u201d and \u201cI left you some chicken in the kitchen. Marnie at the station ordered extra for you. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stick around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo!\u201d Stiles says. \u201cFind missing girls! That\u2019s pretty important. In the grand scheme, and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pushes his door shut and leans against it, banging his head back a couple times. He remembers Derek, and looks over. He\u2019s watching Stiles with a strange look; Stiles can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s sad or jealous or both.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a good relationship with your dad.\u201d Derek\u2019s tone is flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe\u2019re all that we\u2019ve got and all. Though lately it\u2019s been\u2026 I don\u2019t like lying. But I have to. So I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to lie to your family.\u201d Derek pushes away from the wall and crosses his arms like he means business.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a perfect world, yeah,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cBut in the world we live in where there are werewolves and witches and monsters killing people left and right for me to stumble across, then yeah. Yeah, I have to lie to my father, who is the sheriff and whose entire job is to find killers.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets the <i>like you</i> hang unspoken in the air between them. He knows there was no other way for last night\u2019s incident to end, and that Derek had earned the right to kill his uncle, but that wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you could explain to a man of the law. It wasn\u2019t even the sort of thing Stiles was comfortable with discussing with the man who did the killings.</p>\n<p>Derek backs down, and after a few minutes mutters, \u201cI need to talk to my pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn person?\u201d Stiles says, because dude, he does not want the pack in his bedroom, too. Derek is bad enough.</p>\n<p>Derek digs his phone out of his pocket and waves it at Stiles. \u201cThis\u2019ll do. Privacy?\u201d</p>\n<p>So that was how Stiles ended up sitting in the hall, leaning against his closed bedroom door, tapping his feet and picking at a tiny hole in the knee of his pants and considering drawing a few of the protective runes he\u2019d stumbled across so far in the spellbook on his sneakers, because surely it couldn\u2019t <i>hurt</i>.</p>\n<p>Finally he just leans back up against the door and props his head against the doorframe. He can hear the low buzz of Derek\u2019s voice on the other side of the door, just loud enough to make an impression but too distorted to make out the individual words. Stiles feels his eyes growing heavier, and lets them close without a fight.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll just rest for a minute.</p>\n<p>The next thing he knows, he\u2019s falling backwards. He flails his arms and legs but still hits the ground with a thud, staring up at Derek\u2019s amused face. \u201cWakey, wakey, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asshole,\u201d Stiles manages, belatedly noticing the open door and putting two and two together.</p>\n<p>Derek offers him a hand, and pulls him up as easily as if Stiles weighed nothing at all. Stiles is still dazed enough from his unintended nap that he claps Derek on the side of his arm and says, \u201cThanks, chum.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pretty much he\u2019s a moron in every state of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say much else as they look back through the spellbook, and then even start reading through the paperback of love spells hoping for some sort of sign. The spells themselves are extremely broad, and Stiles suspects that there\u2019s a lot of customization to be done to each one. One\u2019s for lilght, another for guidance, and it\u2019s all frustratingly vague. Stiles starts doing some good old fashioned internet research when he realizes how unhelpful the spellbook is, which is about four minutes into round two with it. Unfortunately, he\u2019s pretty sure that ninety percent of what he\u2019s scrolling through is complete bullshit.</p>\n<p>Derek, for his part, seems to be having trouble concentrating. Stiles feels that he\u2019s really falling down on his job as the Velma of their group. Maybe he should just switch to Shaggy and go get a snack.</p>\n<p>Stiles gets a few texts from Scott, normal everyday shit, and he doesn\u2019t even think Scott\u2019s realized yet that Stiles is caught up in a misadventure without him. Which, fine. He knows Scott resides in Allison-opolis right now, but he still would have thought that his best friend would have somehow realized that Stiles had been cursed by witches.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s stupid to be jealous. Stiles throws his phone down and tries googling for magical binding spells again. Mostly he finds some pretty disturbing Harry Potter stuff that he really doesn\u2019t want to think about in connection to his own situation.</p>\n<p>Most of all, the astonishing lack of progress gives Stiles time to actually think about his situation.</p>\n<p>There have only a few awkward moments to arise from the whole connected at the hip thing so far, mostly involving bathroom breaks, but overall\u2026 it\u2019s not bad. Not as bad as Stiles thought it would be when he woke up this morning. Derek\u2019s quiet, and Stiles doesn\u2019t really want to know his opinion of being bound to Stiles, so he just babbles on about everything else, from his thoughts on the best fast food chicken places in town to wondering aloud if Derek will need a flea collar if he completely shifts into alpha-mode, since Stiles has heard that the flea and tick population is really bad this year.</p>\n<p>Derek, for his part, actually doesn\u2019t threaten Stiles with bodily violence, and even makes a few jokes to alleviate the tension from <i>not finding a fucking solution to the spell</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre your puppies okay without adult supervision?\u201d Stiles asks, yawning. It\u2019s been an exhausting day of failing to accomplish anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they can feed and water themselves.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t crack a grin, but Stiles feels like he\u2019s making progress if he\u2019s actually rolling with banter now instead of shutting down and glaring. \u201cUnlike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a perfectly magical valid reason for having your constant supervision, thank you very much,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd unlike your pack, I\u2019m good at staying out of trouble. Isaac was a werewolf for what, five minutes before getting arrested?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose were extenuating circumstances,\u201d Derek says. Stiles thinks that he might actually like his wolves, which\u2026 is contrary to what Stiles had assumed, given the way he treats them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you werewolf types are like, magnets for trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so are you,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>Stiles initially thinks that they\u2019re going back to Derek\u2019s wondrous warehouse of werewolves \u2013 which Stiles starts to think of as the Were House, because it makes him laugh \u2013 for the night, because the thought of Derek sleeping in his house just does not compute, but then Derek starts to strip down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa there cowboy,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls the comforter down on Stiles\u2019 bed. \u201cGetting ready for bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my bed,\u201d Stiles says dumbly.</p>\n<p>Derek looks around. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s the only one in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can sleep on the floor.\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s making a big deal about this.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and pats the other pillow. \u201cYou can either sleep here, or you\u2019re welcome to the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my bed,\u201d Stiles says again, jerking the comforter down on the side of <i>his</i> bed that Derek has deigned to allow him to sleep in. They both traipse to the bathroom for tooth brushing, Stiles staring into the mirror glumly as he realizes that he\u2019s going to be sharing his not-very-big bed with Derek, who is roughly the size of a mountain. </p>\n<p>When they return to his room, he pulls off his jeans and crawls into bed. It\u2019s already dipped down where Derek is settling in on the other side, and Stiles has never felt so awkward in his own bed in his life, and that includes every time his dad has barged in while Stiles still had morning wood.</p>\n<p>Stiles clicks off the lamp and tries to curl up on the edge of the bed, as far from Derek as possible, and does everything he can to make his brain stop thinking about how much more awkward morning wood would be in this situation.</p>\n<p>And then Stiles can only think about boners. He shifts uncomfortably, hyper-aware of his dick. He can feel Derek moving around behind him, trying to get comfortable, and Stiles tries to remember how he puts his hands when it\u2019s Scott spending the night. </p>\n<p>He finally gets settled in a way that he hopes doesn\u2019t look as awkward as it feels, and decisively closes his eyes. He can hear the quiet intake of Derek\u2019s breath, and remembers what it felt like when he was sniffing his arm earlier. The thought sends tingles to all the best places, and Stiles freezes.</p>\n<p>He knows that he\u2019s crossing some sort of line with his thoughts, and that he\u2019s not really thinking about Derek Hale in the way that he\u2019s supposed to be thinking about Derek Hale. Namely, with his dick. It\u2019s wrong, and Derek is <i>right there</i>, and he can fucking smell lust, and oh jesus. Stiles is never going to be able to look him in the eye again.</p>\n<p>So Stiles does the only thing possible, which is to breathe slow and even like he\u2019s asleep and keep his eyes screwed shut and try to force himself to think about things like natural disasters and the fact that he\u2019s an accessory to murder and basically anything except for the half-naked werewolf in his bed.</p>\n<p><i>Pretend it\u2019s Scott, pretend it\u2019s Scott,</i> he keeps thinking, hoping that it will magically make his traitorous dick behave.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t really do anything, and when Stiles peeks over his shoulder, it\u2019s just light enough in the room to make out that Derek is sprawled comfortably on his stomach, one arm over his head, comforter shoved down to his hips. His face is turned away from Stiles, and Stiles really, really hopes that he\u2019s asleep and that this temporary lust-insanity of his can pass unnoticed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are finding a solution <i>tomorrow</i>,\u201d Stiles mutters darkly, punching his pillow and trying yet again to get comfortable. How the hell did he manage to sleep last night?</p>\n<p>The bed shakes slightly, and Stiles glares over his shoulder and sees that Derek\u2019s shoulders are shaking. He is <i>laughing</i> and that means he\u2019s <i>awake</i> and has probably been sniffing all of Stiles\u2019 lusty pheromones and seriously, they might as well just use Stiles as bait, because Stiles really has no will to live in this world anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d he tells Derek\u2019s back. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t reply, which Stiles is equally annoyed and grateful over.</p>\n<p>His phone is buzzing.</p>\n<p>Stiles gropes out with his hand, grabbing for it on his side table, but only manages to knock the phone in the floor. He leans over to find it \u2013 his vision is still bleary from sleep, but he\u2019s pretty sure it landed in the dark recesses under his bed \u2013 but something vice-like around his waist keeps him from reaching it.</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a moment to analyze where he\u2019s at. His room, yes. His bed, yes. And Derek pressed against his back, arm wrapped possessively around his waist and face nuzzled against the back of his neck, yes.</p>\n<p>Stiles freezes.</p>\n<p>Derek is spooning him.</p>\n<p>Derek. Derek Hale. Big spoon.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s empirical proof that curses have a side effect of insanity. Stiles is magically bound to a crazy werewolf. This is probably bad. </p>\n<p>Only it\u2019s also kind of nice, being cuddled. Stiles is a tactile dude, he knows that he likes contact with people, and this is definitely some A+ contact.</p>\n<p>He really doesn\u2019t know what to do. Derek\u2019s asleep, and one of his hands is hot on Stiles\u2019 hip where his t-shirt is rucked up, and his breath is steady against the back of his neck. Stiles doesn\u2019t even know if Derek realizes that he\u2019s cuddling Stiles, and if he doesn\u2019t, does that make Stiles a non-consensual cuddler? </p>\n<p>He pokes at Derek\u2019s arm. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek holds him tighter and shifts closer, and what do you know, it turns out that Stiles wasn\u2019t the one who should have worried about morning wood. \u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDerek? You\u2019re spooning me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek mumbles again, shifting in a way that probably should be under the bad touch umbrella but that Stiles enjoys a stupid amount. It takes every bit of self control that Stiles possesses to not push himself back against Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019m going to need a heads up if you\u2019re going to hump my leg,\u201d Stiles says instead, voice slightly strangled. Derek\u2019s grip on his hip immediately loosens, and Stiles can actually feel the second when Derek realizes what he\u2019s doing and to whom and pulls back.</p>\n<p>Stiles regrets saying anything immediately; he can feel the ghost of Derek\u2019s hand on his hip and he fights the urge to re-ignite the cuddling. Then his face burns red when he realizes that Derek probably knows how much he enjoyed the whole sleep-cuddle thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek says, sounding embarrassed. Stiles isn\u2019t quite in a place yet where he can look at Derek, especially without his face possibly catching on fire from how red he is, and so he distracts himself by digging under the bed for his lost phone. </p>\n<p>All he manages to do is to fall out of bed in a tangle of covers and mortification. He tries to sit up and only manages to hit his head on the corner of his side table, but dammit, he found his phone. He holds it up triumphantly. \u201cFound it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongrats,\u201d Derek says. Stiles finally looks at him, and he looks\u2026 super awkward. All of his confidence seems gone, and he\u2019s kind of perched on his side of the bed, twisting a pillow in his hands. Stiles absolutely does not check the status of his boner, because that would be a creepy and invasive thing to do, no matter what part of Stiles that boner accidentally touched this morning. Stiles is not a creep. </p>\n<p>Okay, Stiles <i>usually</i> isn\u2019t a creep.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cyou aren\u2019t freaking out, are you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says unconvincingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause sleep-snuggling is something that happens,\u201d Stiles reassures him. \u201cOne time I made out with Scott\u2019s shoulder, and he wouldn\u2019t let me back in his house for a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Derek says, the tension slowly leaving his shoulders. Then, after a pause: \u201cA whole week? How did he survive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight? I\u2019m pretty sure he got lost on the way to school at least twice,\u201d Stiles says happily, because he loves Scott and finds his dumbassery super endearing. It\u2019s pretty much the basis of their friendship, from that time in elementary school when Stiles saved Scott from eating rubber cement and introduced him to covering his fingerprints with Elmer\u2019s instead.</p>\n<p>Stiles still sometimes think that if they had followed up on that desire to become master thieves, their lives would be a lot safer and filled with far less violent crime.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t seem inclined to say anything else, so Stiles decides to just pretend like it didn\u2019t happen. Except that he has to do one thing first. \u201cDo you need a hug?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I\u2026 what?\u201d Derek says, like no one\u2019s ever offered him a hug before. That is patently untrue, Stiles assumes, because no one who went through school with cheekbones like that could have completely avoided offers for hugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cA hug,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cA manly embrace of bro-ness, if you prefer. Your subconscious mind obviously wants some affection, dude, is all I\u2019m saying, and I\u2019m willing to hug it out with you, since we\u2019re obviously on that level now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour loss,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cI happen to be an awesome hugger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, like he\u2019s not sure when he lost control of the situation. Stiles, for one, is just grateful that his own awkwardness last night has clearly been forgotten in light of Derek\u2019s own bedsharing fail this morning.</p>\n<p>A tiny part of Stiles is completely pissed at himself for ruining it before he found out how far it could have gone, though. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s into Derek or wants this whole situation to be more uncomfortable than it already is, it\u2019s just that Stiles is really fucking tired of being a virgin and also Derek, he can admit, is crazy hot.</p>\n<p>But he absolutely is not going to have any more thoughts about him, because this situation is bad enough. </p>\n<p>Stiles remembers that he\u2019s still holding his phone, sitting on the floor in a tangle of blankets, and feels dumb as he finally looks at the text.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott says that Allison\u2019s freaking out,\u201d Stiles tells Derek. \u201cBecause her family is apparently on some sort of literal witch hunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich witches?\u201d Derek asks, like Scott would have given names and addresses even if he knew which witches were being hunted. </p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs and calls Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Scott hisses. \u201cThis is terrible! Allison\u2019s family is going to kill some innocent girl!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles does his best not to feel guilty, and he sees Derek shift uncomfortably. \u201cDo we know it\u2019s an innocent girl? I mean, what if it\u2019s a bad witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there bad witches?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cBecause Allison\u2019s been reading the beastiary and she\u2019s pretty convinced that it\u2019s just a normal girl who happens to be able to levitate some pencils or something who is about to get whacked by professional hunters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been watching the Sopranos again?\u201d Stiles asks, because really, who uses \u2018whacked\u2019 in a normal conversation like this?</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d Scott snaps. \u201cA girl could get killed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I liked it better when you just worried about Allison and lacrosse,\u201d Stiles says. Scott makes a strangled noise. \u201cFine, fine. Tell Allison to find out where her parents are going and to see what she can find out about the witch they\u2019re hunting. Then meet us at the usual spot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUs?\u201d Scott asks, but Stiles hangs up. He doesn\u2019t really know how to explain the Derek situation yet.</p>\n<p>Though it would have been super entertaining to hear Scott\u2019s sputters if Stiles told him Derek was currently hanging out in his underwear on Stiles\u2019 bed. He considers calling back for that express purpose, but then decides that it probably wouldn\u2019t go over well with Derek himself, who can quite obviously hear everything happening during the phone call.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust this,\u201d Derek says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would be very concerned if you did,\u201d Stiles replies, \u201cgiven your complete lack of trust in anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would the Argents hunt the witches now?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026 is a pretty good question,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI mean, the only ones the witches have been fucking with is us, and the Argents don\u2019t care about that. There\u2019s something we\u2019re missing here. Something that Allison might know.\u201d </p>\n<p>And so, an hour later, Stiles pulled his Jeep up beside Allison\u2019s car at their usual spot in the woods. </p>\n<p>Stiles feels the strange twinge in his stomach as he crosses around the jeep to where Derek\u2019s waiting on him, the one that indicates he\u2019s gone too far out of range, and he steps quicker to get closer to Derek. He tugs at the cuffs of the plaid flannel shirt he\u2019s wearing over his t-shirt nervously, even though he knows Scott won\u2019t notice the claw marks.</p>\n<p>He and Derek had both agreed that part of the story didn\u2019t need to be shared, even if they told Scott and Allison about the curse. And that was a big if, since Derek didn\u2019t think it was important information to share.</p>\n<p>Stiles, on the other hand, wants as many brains as possible working on the curse-breaking. The more time he spends with Derek the more disturbing feelings he has. Then there\u2019s also the fact that he\u2019s a healthy young man and there\u2019s only so long that he can go without having some special alone time, and after last night and this morning there\u2019s no way in hell that he\u2019s bringing that up to Derek.</p>\n<p>Especially since Stiles is pretty sure that the memory of Derek\u2019s hand on his bare hip and the feel of Derek pressed up against his back is going to feature prominently in his next private Stiles appreciation hour.</p>\n<p>When they arrive, Allison and Scott break apart guiltily. There are leaves in Allison\u2019s hair, and Scott grins goofily until he realizes who\u2019s with Stiles.</p>\n<p>Allison breaks the totally not awkward at <i>all</i> silence. \u201cHi Stiles. And um. Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crosses his arms and glowers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Scott demands.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say anything, which, maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s always getting arrested for murder and shit. There\u2019s such a thing as too stoic. Stiles makes a mental note to bring it up once they\u2019re alone.</p>\n<p>Then he feels weird, because since when is he uncomfortable saying <i>anything</i> in front of Scott? He told Scott about his first wet dream, for christsakes. In detail. Harrowing detail, in fact, just to see Scott squirm.</p>\n<p>So he jumps in. \u201cWhat did your family say about the witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a lot,\u201d Allison says, still giving Derek a wary look. \u201cWe have to warn her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek speaks up. \u201cWhy are they hunting witches now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a girl who disappeared,\u201d Allison says. \u201cLast night. They think it was this overreaching coven.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks a few times, and tries really hard not to laugh. Which is inappropriate. So very inappropriate.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Derek says, because he\u2019s much better at playing it cool than Stiles is.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo covens often overreach?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what I can tell, it\u2019s not unheard of, but there have been some disturbing rumors about this one. The usual sort of stuff that you hear about in horror movies, really \u2013 missing animals, strange injuries, people suddenly gaining power that they shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Allison doesn\u2019t actually look all that concerned about those things. \u201cBut the weird part is that we\u2019re actually hunting them, when usually hunters focus on more lethal prey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that these witches deserve getting hunted down. Well, mostly. Pump them for information first, and then hunt them. The terror he\u2019d felt during the confrontations with both the individual witch and the coven was probably making him biased, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to keep them from killing innocent girls,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s girls now,\u201d Derek says. \u201cEarlier it was just one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott waves his hand in a <i>you know what I mean</i> sort of way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re talking about taking down the entire coven,\u201d Allison explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if they <i>are</i> bad witches?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Allison raises her eyebrow. \u201cThe two of you kind of sound like you\u2019re okay with the hunters killing witches.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances at Derek, who shrugs. When he looks back, Scott is glaring at him, like Stiles has ditched him or something. Stiles gives him his best \u201cWhat?\u201d look.</p>\n<p>And then Scott just keeps shooting him these sad hurt looks like Stiles is betraying their friendship, and Stiles really can\u2019t stand for Scott to look at him like that, so he bursts out with, \u201cWe met a witch and she cursed us and the coven is totally evil and we should let the Argents kill them, probably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>What</i>,\u201d Scott and Allison both say. Derek punches him in the arm.</p>\n<p>Stiles rubs it and says, \u201cIt\u2019s been a very eventful weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of curse?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cDo you have like\u2026 extra parts now? Or boils?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of extra parts would I have?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cWhat kind of curses are you thinking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott shuffles his foot and mutters something about Harry Potter. Allison appears to be giving some of her life choices serious reconsideration, and Stiles is just going to assume it\u2019s her current association with werewolves.</p>\n<p>She sighs and says, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth, but Derek speaks before Stiles gets a chance. \u201cShe was in my territory. When I went to confront her, she cursed us. Then I stopped her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles definitely notices that Derek has omitted Stiles\u2019 extremely vital role in stopping the curse-casting process, and also the fact that witches can fucking control werewolves. Derek really, really doesn\u2019t trust Allison. Or, Stiles supposes, Derek doesn\u2019t trust anything with the name Argent. Which Stiles can\u2019t entirely blame him for, given the fact that Kate Argent murdered his entire family, but it does make things annoying.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re stuck together,\u201d Stiles clarifies, because Derek glossed over the specifics. \u201cMagically. Move more than a few yards apart and there\u2019s excruciating pain, yadda yadda yadda.\u201d He waves his hand around for emphasis.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Allison says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you poop?\u201d Scott adds.</p>\n<p>Allison rolls her eyes.\u201dReally, sweetie? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere have been some awkward moments,\u201d Stiles explains, because really, he\u2019d want to know if he was Scott.</p>\n<p>Derek just looks heavenward, like he\u2019s hoping for some sort of lightning bolt to remove him from this situation entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why were you there in the first place?\u201d Scott presents a pretty valid question. Stiles looks to Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs like he always does just before giving out a nugget of information he doesn\u2019t want to share. \u201cI needed a human there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause humans are super useful against witches?\u201d Allison asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the descendent of a line of perfectly human monster hunters,\u201d Stiles throws in because, hey, he\u2019s totally proven himself useful against all sorts of creepy crawlies. Stiles is the man.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause witches can sometimes compel werewolves,\u201d Derek says reluctantly.</p>\n<p>No one bothers to ask if Derek knows any other humans; his social group is remarkably tiny. It was either Stiles or Allison, and there was no way that Derek would ask an Argent to come along for backup.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t really like thinking about it like that, though. He likes to think that maybe he and Derek have bonded a bit over the last dozen or so times they\u2019ve saved each other\u2019s necks. </p>\n<p>At least, that\u2019s the way it rolls in every buddy cop movie he\u2019s ever seen. Apparently the rules are different for creatures of the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a handbook or something you can lend me?\u201d Scott\u2019s got a lost-puppy look on his face, and Stiles knows it means he\u2019s upset that no one tells him anything about his condition. \u201cWhat if I just ran into a witch or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witches usually leave us alone,\u201d Derek says. \u201cThe hunters are right.\u201d Somehow he doesn\u2019t choke on the words, though he grimaces when he says them. \u201cThis coven is out of control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to the witch who cursed you? Can we just\u2026 kidnap her and make her reverse it?\u201d Allison asks.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t have to answer, just gives her a menacing look.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh great. Well, there goes the idea of telling my parents about this,\u201d Allison sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t tell them that the missing girl was an evil witch who got eaten by a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t eat her.\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t sound exactly offended that Allison would accuse him of cannibalism. It\u2019s more indignant, like he purposefully held back and wants credit for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant a gold star?\u201d Allison asks sweetly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how do we break the curse?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cI mean, if we can\u2019t go around witches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been reading this spellbook,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t found anything yet. From what I can tell, most curses seem to fade as the witch\u2019s power fades.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the witch is dead,\u201d Allison says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but covens work by pooling their power into one massive well,\u201d Derek explains, throwing out one of the few useful nuggets of info that they picked up from the spellbook.</p>\n<p>\u201cMagical time share,\u201d Stiles adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think we should take down a coven of dangerous witches,\u201d Allison says, \u201cso that you two can have private time again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Stiles says cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been, what, a day?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll go away on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were all gung ho to save people,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cSave us!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Scott says. \u201cWhat if the witches aren\u2019t bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say we had to commit mass murder,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cJust, you know. Terror and intimidation. Strong-arm those witches!\u201d He claps his hands encouragingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGross,\u201d Allison tells him. \u201cSurely there has to be a reasonable witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went to a magic shop yesterday,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd they attacked us just for showing our faces.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the story of your life, though, right?\u201d Scott asks Derek, because apparently Scott has even less of a survival instinct than Stiles thought.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good point, though. Derek scowls and says, \u201cThey are our enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s supervillain talk,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cThough I have to admit, firsthand experience does pretty much support your hypothesis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Scott says. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe need more information,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cDo you have any brilliant ideas about how to get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Allison says. \u201cMaybe. Though it depends\u2026 does your pack know about this yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d Derek is giving Allison a measuring look, like he\u2019s never really seen her before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should call them in. If this coven really is dangerous, we should work together, and since you two are stuck together, that means the rest of us are going to have to work together, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison\u2014\u201c Scott begins, and Stiles is on his side. It\u2019s not that he just doesn\u2019t like Derek\u2019s pack, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t like <i>and</i> definitely does not trust Derek\u2019s pack. Erica\u2019s a hot mess, Isaac\u2019s a fucking psycho, and Boyd\u2026 well, Boyd doesn\u2019t give in to bartering, and Stiles is pretty sure that sort of strong-mindedness can\u2019t be a good quality in a new werewolf. </p>\n<p>He trusts Derek, but Derek\u2019s taste in potential beta werewolves leaves a lot to be desired. After all, he willingly bit <i>Jackson</i>, and seriously, who would want to mystically tie themselves to a douchebag of that caliber? </p>\n<p>Though, okay, maybe a lot of Stiles\u2019 feelings about Jackson revolve around the fact that Lydia has feelings about Jackson, and perhaps he\u2019s a bit biased. But really, it\u2019s Lydia, who is brilliant and stunning and\u2026</p>\n<p>And who Stiles hasn\u2019t even thought of once in the past few days. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s mildly disturbing now that he thinks of it, since Lydia\u2019s been a staple of his thoughts since the third grade. It\u2019s like Derek overwhelmed Stiles so much that he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else.</p>\n<p>He physically shakes the thought off, and then realizes that Derek, Scott and Allison are all staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve never seen him do anything weird before, jeez.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Allison says, \u201cIf we all work together, we can figure this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>And to his surprise, Derek nods. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Scott begins, then sighs. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just nods. \u201cIt\u2019s hammer time, ladies and gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Leaving with Derek feels more awkward than arriving with Derek, mainly because Stiles knows firsthand that Scott and Allison are going to gossip the whole way home and he wants in on it, dammit, not steering his Jeep towards Derek\u2019s hovel wondering what his friends are saying about him.</p>\n<p>Because, really. If it was any else in this situation Stiles would have ten thousand jokes lined up, and he just kind of doubts Scott\u2019s ability to properly mine this golden humor opportunity.</p>\n<p>Allison\u2019s probably got it covered, though. That reassures Stiles a little.</p>\n<p>When he glances over, Derek looks\u2026 nervous. Like he\u2019s going to the dentist, not going to see his pack.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to bite. Wait. Are they going to bite? I\u2019m really not prepared for some strange werewolf circle-bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to bite you,\u201d Derek says, which isn\u2019t really an answer. But Derek\u2019s the head honcho and surely he can handle his underlings. Stiles will just have confidence that Derek has a fucking clue about how to control his wolves.</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s with the upside-down smile you got going on there?\u201d </p>\n<p>For a second Stiles thinks Derek is just going to growl or make one of his many menacing faces at him, but then Derek leans his head against the headrest and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Alphas can\u2019t show weakness to their pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cI\u2019m not one to celebrate violence and murder, but how the hell is saying that you killed a witch who cursed you showing weakness?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that she cursed me?\u201d Derek glances over at him, and Stiles concentrates very hard on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s demeaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a frolic in a field of butterflies for me,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut demeaning is kind of a strong word for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn alpha must be strong,\u201d Derek insists. \u201cI have to command respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always thought respect was one of those earned deals,\u201d Stiles replies. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know anything about werewolves,\u201d Derek snips. Stiles throws his hands up and Derek continues, \u201cForming a pack is\u2026 complicated. There are a lot of ways it can go sour, and I\u2019m trying to keep this together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that those three? Don\u2019t need you to be all grim and scowly in the corner,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, I know them. Sort of. And confiding in them and bringing them in on something this important to you is just going to instill a greater sense of confidence in you and their self-worth and also will give them a tangible goal, which is something that all my guidance counselors insisted was vital.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I should be their coach, not their alpha.\u201d Derek sounds skeptical.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that you catch more flies with honey, you know?\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cBoyd at the very least is a reasonable guy. And do you really want a pack that you can\u2019t ease up around? Because that sounds exhausting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey keep me strong,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIf any of them go omega, I might not have the strength to take out these witches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s the beauty of teamwork,\u201d Stiles says, because seriously. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got your back. And also, just so you know, you don\u2019t have to force people into helping you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou wanted to let me die when I got shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI barely knew you.\u201d Stiles waves a hand around airly. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re cuddle buddies! See how it works?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe agreed never to speak of that,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never agreed to that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI would remember something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was unspoken.\u201d Was Derek teasing him? Surely not. </p>\n<p>\u201cNonverbal contracts aren\u2019t binding,\u201d Stiles replies cheerfully. He pulls into the parking lot of Derek\u2019s terrible living accommodations. \u201cBut seriously. You can kick any of their asses without trying. Don\u2019t worry about impressing them. Just get them to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can now officially put \u2018werewolf pep-talker\u2019 on his resume. He\u2019s probably got more werewolf pep talking experience than anyone on the planet. It would be a killer college application essay, really, though it\u2019d only work for liberal arts schools.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs and gets out of the Jeep. Stiles scrambles around the Jeep, but still feels the beginning tugs of pain as Derek gets too far ahead of him. He jogs to catch up with Derek, who marches into his lair like he doesn\u2019t have the slightest concern about how this is going to go down.</p>\n<p>At least he\u2019s good at posturing. Stiles will totally give him that. He\u2019s practically at Olympic levels of putting up a good front.</p>\n<p>Of course, it leaves Stiles racing after him looking like a moron. When they get inside, Derek\u2019s pack is hanging out around a set of stairs, posing in their matching leatherwear like they\u2019re about to make the cover of Alt Press.</p>\n<p>Erica gives Stiles the stink-eye, which he manfully ignores. Isaac is inspecting his claws, and when he notices Stiles, he raises them menacingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to bust out into the Bad Romance dance?\u201d Stiles asks, because that, he\u2019d like to see. Boyd laughs.</p>\n<p>Derek glares, like Stiles is supposed to be seen and not heard. Stiles however did not agree to that. He has to at the very least snark at the wolves, because he hopes that snark overpowers the stench of annoyance and fear.</p>\n<p>Not that he\u2019s scared of them or anything. He knows perfectly well that he\u2019s standing behind the scariest mofo in the bunch, and that he\u2019s squarely on Derek\u2019s do-not-kill list. He hopes. </p>\n<p>It belatedly occurs to him that one solution to the curse would be to remove Stiles from the equation, but Derek has had plenty of opportunities to do so, and the worst he\u2019s done is a little bit of inappropriate snuggling. </p>\n<p>Which is not something Stiles is going to think about in the midst of a pack of emotionally disturbed werewolves. At all.</p>\n<p>He focuses all of his energy on watching Isaac try to save the menacing claw move without ripping off Gaga, which is far more entertaining than it should be. Even Erica is obviously suppressing laughter, though Derek\u2019s face is stoic as it always is when he\u2019s got his Alpha-pants on.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Derek says, glaring Isaac into submission. One look at the kid tells Stiles that Derek is choosing the most wrong possible method of control, but right now that\u2019s not his problem. Later, though, he\u2019s going to bring it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going after some witches,\u201d Derek begins, and Erica\u2019s head snaps up to attention. Boyd and Isaac don\u2019t react, which means \u2013 interestingly\u2014that Erica kept the previous morning\u2019s conversation confidential.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike as in ding dong, the witch is dead?\u201d Boyd asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of them is, at least,\u201d Erica slides in with. Isaac\u2019s eyes widen with understanding.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we went after killers,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with us <i>becoming</i> killers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are worse things,\u201d Isaac offers. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek speaks up, \u201cthere isn\u2019t. We aren\u2019t indiscriminate killers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Isaac asks. \u201cBecause that girl we buried seemed to have been killed pretty indiscriminately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSelf defense,\u201d Stiles offers up. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t some innocent nature lover.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where the problem lies,\u201d Derek says. \u201cThere was a curse. In the process of finding out how to end it, we stumbled into the sights of a coven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that even mean?\u201d Erica asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles is just impressed that somehow Derek can be cagey even when his sole goal is to share information. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is the most annoying kid in school here, anyway?\u201d Boyd asks, which is pretty rich, considering that Stiles tried his best to save him from having to deal with all this supernatural bullshit. He makes a face at Boyd that he hopes represents this line of thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the curse,\u201d Derek says, and it\u2019s really adorable that he\u2019s suddenly a comedian. Really. Stiles turns his disapproving face on him. \u201cSome sort of proximity spell tying us together. The witch attacked like she had been expecting a werewolf, and when we went to find another witch to remove the spell, the coven attacked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a war on between witches and werewolves?\u201d Isaac sounds eager.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a war,\u201d Derek immediately says. \u201cThis feels personal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles jerks to attention. The thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind; he\u2019s become so accustomed to the Argents\u2019 agenda against all werewolves and the more random-seeming murders of Perer Hale and the kanima that he hadn\u2019t thought about <i>why</i> the witch had attacked.</p>\n<p>Or why the coven had attacked. The witch\u2019s body hadn\u2019t been found \u2013 his dad was still off leading the search party, proving that one thing Isaac was in fact good at was disposing bodies \u2013 and they were just working off the assumption that she was dead from some sort of magical backlash, but Stiles didn\u2019t think that intangible forces would explain the details to the coven.</p>\n<p>How had they known it was a werewolf? </p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that he should have thought of these things before. He\u2019s supposed to be the clever one. He\u2019s one hundred percent the Hermione in the Scott-Allison-Stiles trifecta of awesome. It\u2019s like he\u2019s unable to think properly when Derek\u2019s around. Probably because he\u2019s focusing too much on survival. And maybe fear, but he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s getting over that.</p>\n<p>Derek hasn\u2019t slammed him into any walls yet, at least. Stiles must have gained a few brownie points somewhere.</p>\n<p>He tunes back in to what Derek is saying to the pack, which seems to be a rundown on the dangers that witches pose for werewolves. Most of them involve ways that witches can remove free will from individual wolves and transform them into mindless killing machines, which\u2026 seems like a big fucking loophole for people to live with.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there any way you can like, keep witches from mindfucking you?\u201d Stiles asks. He\u2019s slouching against an abandoned train car and trying his best to not look as completely bored out of his skull as he really is. It\u2019s a losing battle. \u201cBecause it occurs to me that you lot are a pretty big liability if they decide to, you know, turn you into killer muppets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that witches are susceptible to iron, but that\u2019s not something that we can use to keep them out of our heads.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if witches can turn us into their personal attack dogs,\u201d Erica wonders, \u201cwhy did you seek one out in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was on my territory,\u201d Derek says. And\u2026 oh great. </p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even look abashed. He looks like it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable reason to seek out someone who could destroy him. Stiles is assuming that this is the alpha bullshit rearing its ugly head.</p>\n<p>Especially since the other wolves just nod, like it\u2019s perfectly rational.</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head at them all, but refrains from telling them what he actually thinks. He\u2019s outnumbered, after all. \u201cSo why was she on your territory?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we have to find out,\u201d Derek says. \u201cErica, I want you and Boyd to go sniffing around in the woods. Figure out where the witch came from, how long she\u2019s been crossing over into our territory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre territory boundaries something that witches know about?\u201d Stiles asks, because he\u2019s known about this werewolf nonsense for months and this is the first that he\u2019s heard about there being actual drawn lines in the sand.</p>\n<p>Though, the first time he and Scott ran into Derek in the woods, he did say something about trespassing.</p>\n<p>Maybe it meant more than he thought it did, at the time.</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cThis has been Hale land for generations. They know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if this is something left over from Peter?\u201d Stiles asks, because really, Peter managed to fuck a lot of things up for someone who was meant to be in a coma. Maybe he cut some deals with witches, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Derek says, cutting off that line of thought. Stiles thinks he probably just doesn\u2019t <i>want</i> for more bad things to fall on the head of a member of his family. He seems pretty sensitive to that. Understandably. </p>\n<p>Boyd speaks up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to turn into some sort of supernatural turf war, is it? Because I didn\u2019t sign up for that shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares. \u201cYou signed up for power, and with power comes responsibility. You should know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t a big Spiderman fan?\u201d Stiles suggests, but just got glares from both Derek and Boyd. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Isaac asks, looking as cagey as ever. Stiles is pretty sure that he practices those weird slumping poses in the mirror for maximum creep-factor.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay away from the investigation,\u201d Derek says immediately. \u201cYou just got out of trouble. You don\u2019t need to be seen creeping around another murder investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of the pack bring up the fact that Derek\u2019s been doing exactly that after, just like Isaac, being arrested for the murder of a family member. Stiles assumes this means that Derek has neglected to tell them anything about his history.</p>\n<p>Though surely they heard about it. It\u2019s not like Beacon Hills is a booming metropolis filled with daily murders. Well, at least, it didn\u2019t used to be.</p>\n<p>Stiles will at least give Derek credit for trying to keep people out of trouble, instead of contributing too much to the town\u2019s murder count. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo what, I just sit around and twiddle my thumbs?\u201d Isaac demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking more that you could wander around town,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBe seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe bait?\u201d Isaac says hungrily.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Derek smiles. \u201cSee if you can lure any witches out.\u201d He surveys his pack. \u201cKeep me updated. Let me know the second you learn anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t we sending anyone to the witches?\u201d Erica asks. \u201cIt seems like we need to be more proactive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Derek says. \u201cJust not a wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to what?\u201d Jackson asks. He raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>Stiles is really going to practice that move in the mirror, because who knows when he\u2019s going to need to look like a total douchebag?</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to a bookstore,\u201d Derek says calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the places with lots and lots of books inside that you can buy,\u201d Stiles says.\u201dNot to be confused with a library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what a bookstore is, dickbag,\u201d Jackson snaps. \u201cWhy do you want me to go to one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo talk to girls,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou do know how to do that without pissing them off, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike you, yes,\u201d Jackson replies.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so suddenly you need me.\u201d Jackson tightens his jaw. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t need you. Go fuck yourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that you have a lot of anger about how things went down.\u201d Derek begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s understating it a bit,\u201d Jackson snaps. \u201cFor starters, you pinned me down and fed me poison.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, it was your own poison,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t exactly Mr. Innocent yourself. But can you just hear us out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you two even working together anyway?\u201d Jackson asks. \u201cIsn\u2019t all this stuff a little out of your league?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Stiles agrees. \u201cEspecially the witch thing. It turns out magic is way creepier than claws.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWitch thing,\u201d Jackson repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe want you to get some info from some witches,\u201d Derek clarifies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Jackson looks almost complimented, now that he knows that he\u2019s being asked to go on an actual mission.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can sense werewolves,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAnd\u2026 I\u2019m curious. If you can sense magic, you\u2019d be an asset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, so you\u2019re saying that werewolves are too chickenshit to go after some chicks who dance in the moonlight,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cAnd that you need someone awesome, meaning me, to go in and save your asses.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks like he just bit a lemon. Stiles figures it\u2019s up to him to save this. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares, but Stiles is pretty much immune to that at this point, since he\u2019s been getting 24/7 glares for the past few days. He has a feeling this is going to be useful in the future. Maybe soon he\u2019ll even stop flinching when Derek fakes him out.</p>\n<p>Who the hell is he kidding? It\u2019ll take a lot more than prolonged exposure to not flinch at that. </p>\n<p>Jackson shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m in. Are the girls cute?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of them,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cGet your scaly ass over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what are we doing now?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cLike, what does the general do while the troops are all out trooping?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d Derek\u2019s driving for once, and they\u2019re parked off an access road to the woods. Stiles thinks that if anyone drives up they\u2019ll assume hanky-panky is going on, since there\u2019s no valid reason for anyone to be hanging out in a car here. He really hopes his dad doesn\u2019t drive by and investigate.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s got his hands loosely clasped on top of the steering wheel. He looks like someone who has given up, which is kind of the opposite of how Stiles feels right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean gathering information and taking out the witches?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cBecause that pretty much has to work if we ever want to be independent again. Which I do. A lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to fall apart.\u201d Derek keeps staring straight ahead. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re relying on a coven of witches not realizing what Jackson is for our main source of information. And that\u2019s not even bringing in the Argents and how they\u2019re going to kill everyone before we get an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean your plan isn\u2019t to kill everyone?\u201d Stiles is super relieved, but startled. \u201cThe way you\u2019re talking I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a killer,\u201d Derek says. \u201cNot like that. I\u2019m not Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you get a little\u2026\u201d Stiles trails off, and then says, \u201cLike with Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something terribly sad crosses Derek\u2019s eyes, and Stiles doesn\u2019t understand it at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point I was making,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou sent wolves out to kill her. I understand why, just\u2026 my point is that sometimes you get hasty. And overreach a bit. In the name of justice. You\u2019re like the goddamn Batman. The intent is good, the execution leaves a little to be desired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe goddamn Batman,\u201d Derek repeats, staring at Stiles like he\u2019s an alien.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even front,\u201d Stiles tells him sternly. \u201cI\u2019ve been in your room, mister. I saw that longbox hiding under a pile of interchangeable leather jackets. You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Derek does something completely unexpected. He bursts out into laughter. \u201cDoes that make you Robin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Stiles says, then adds, with feeling, \u201cDammit! I\u2019m never going to get to be Batman. Scott won\u2019t let me, and in this dynamic duo right here I\u2019m obviously not Batman. I\u2019m going to find my own sidekick one day, and then the world had best watch out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted.\u201d Derek\u2019s still smiling. \u201cBut you believe me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world, that Stiles believes him. He takes a deep breath, and actually looks at Derek for the first time all day. His shoulders are hunched, and somehow Stiles has grown accustomed to his sheer physical presence \u2013 he\u2019s not actually that much taller than Stiles, he knows, but he fills up so much more space, both muscle-wise and just\u2026 his aura of power.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks that must be what being an Alpha is, though Derek had the same presence before he killed his uncle. And furthermore\u2026 </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like with Peter Hale. Derek\u2019s not insane, he\u2019s not driven by a crazed need for revenge. Stiles isn\u2019t really sure what drives him, now that he knows what happened to his sister.</p>\n<p>His pack, maybe. Probably. It\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s worked at.</p>\n<p>And Stiles realizes, just like that, that he does trust Derek. He\u2019s trusting him with his life, and he\u2019s trusting him with his future, considering the complete lack of one he\u2019d have if he was permanently bound to someone else. </p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Derek has a strange, quiet look on his face. Something passes through his eyes that Stiles can\u2019t put a name to, something important, he thinks. And then he says quietly, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles licks his lips nervously, then says, \u201cNo problem, buckaroo,\u201d because that\u2019s just who he is. A moment ruiner. </p>\n<p>Derek just shakes his head fondly and says, \u201cCome on. I have a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles believes in Derek, sure, but that doesn\u2019t make the words any less alarming. \u201cYippie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek puts the car into gear, and Stiles is just along for the ride.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles hisses.\u201dThis is the exact wrong place for us to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek puts the Camaro in park, but leaves the engine idling. \u201cI\u2019m not going inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust being here is bad enough. We\u2019re going to get shot.\u201d Stiles is maybe reconsidering his thoughts about Derek\u2019s sanity. \u201cI can just call Allison, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk to Allison,\u201d Derek says, staring at the Argent house. They\u2019re parked across the street, in full view of the house\u2019s many windows. There is absolutely zero chance that the <i>family of werewolf hunters</i> have neglected to notice Derek\u2019s flashy-ass car.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who are you here for?\u201d Stiles asks, hoping he doesn\u2019t already know. \u201cBecause her dad is the exact wrong person to speak to. Especially on account of how he wants you dead. Professionally. His profession is wanting you dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s also the best resource on what can harm witches that we have right now.\u201d Derek is staring straight ahead, not looking Stiles in the eye at all. He totally knows that this is a terrible idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Allison could figure something out,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe could like. Ask her dad. He doesn\u2019t want to kill <i>her</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a look that makes Stiles feel about four years old. \u201cHe\u2019s good at what he does. He\u2019ll have already figured out that the witches are targeting werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little premature?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cThey\u2019ve really only targeted you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t even bother with the speech about how attacking the Alpha is attacking the whole pack, just rolls his eyes and settles more comfortably into his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, are we just lurking?\u201dStiles doesn\u2019t know how to lurk. He\u2019s a big fan of knocking on doors or calling people. Normal, sane ways of communicating with people. </p>\n<p>\u201cJust wait, he\u2019ll show,\u201d Derek says, staring ahead.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is already the most boring thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Stiles says after a few seconds. \u201cHow is this your hobby? Have you ever considered knitting or doing something productive while you lurk?\u201d He pauses. Derek doesn\u2019t react. He adds in a pained voice, \u201cThere aren\u2019t even any <i>shadows</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares. Stiles sticks out his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wait, okay?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice has a tiny bit of pleading, and Stiles sighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles fiddles with every button he can find and is pretty close to snooping in the glovebox when Chris Argent taps on Derek\u2019s window. Stiles flails his arms madly and yelps, \u201cJesus! Where did you even come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Chris says slowly, staring at Derek like he\u2019s a madman, \u201care you doing here? In front of my <i>home</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek calmly looks up at him and says, \u201cHow do you fight a witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d imagine you would use your claws, being as you\u2019re a monster I\u2019ve made it my life\u2019s mission to kill,\u201d Chris replies. \u201cYou killed my sister. If my father comes out here\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe\u2019s not here. I can\u2019t hear him in the house at all. I suspect he\u2019s out laying a trap for the witches.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks that werewolf super-hearing will never not be creepy as hell. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen in theory wouldn\u2019t you just let him do it?\u201d Chris says. \u201cIt\u2019s no concern of yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have information I need,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t approve of carte blanche murder.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019re capable of,\u201d Chris says.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust us, we do,\u201d Stiles throws in, even though he\u2019s pretty sure this is another situation where Derek wants him to sit silently in the background. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you approve, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair hunt,\u201d Chris says without feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit and you know it,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what your father does. He\u2019s more bloodthirsty than I am. I\u2019m not asking for anything to jeopardize your hunt. I just need to know something that can contain a witch. You know why I can\u2019t just approach one. And if I do, and they turn me into a monster, who do you think I\u2019m going to get sent after? Whoever else is coming their way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chris nods slowly. \u201cFine. Iron chain. Bury it in a circle underground, hide the circle, and trick the witch into getting inside of it. Their powers won\u2019t work. Containing the witch there will be your problem, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Stiles adds, because it never hurts to be polite.</p>\n<p>Chris just glares at him, like he\u2019s trying to figure out what Stiles\u2019 angle is, being there, but just shakes his head. \u201cStay away from this,\u201d he warns. </p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head and puts the car into gear. He pulls away from the curb, leaving Chris Argent standing there, staring after them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do realize you just tipped them off that you\u2019re interested in the witch thing,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll probably figure out that we\u2019re the ones who did in the missing girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Derek says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t seeing me as a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonthreatening is a good thing,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cA very good thing. It means people aren\u2019t actively trying to kill you. Just passively.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk Allison if she\u2019s gotten any headway on the beastiary,\u201d Derek instructs, ignoring Stiles\u2019 concerns. </p>\n<p>Stiles types out a quick text. His phone buzzes almost immediately with a response, and it\u2019s not what Stiles expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe says that they\u2019ve gone to see someone about it,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t say who. Or why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe they found a lead.\u201d Derek sounds hopeful. Stiles really, really hopes so too.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you going to do the iron chain thing?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a look. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to sit around twiddling my thumbs waiting on the curse to be lifted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his hands up. \u201cJust asking. So where do you even get an iron chain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, Stiles finds himself standing beside Derek, looking a display of chains in the hardware store.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to get back to my dad,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that he won\u2019t hear about his son buying a chain with a former murder suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely ordinary purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only valid reasons I can think of for us to need a chain would be if one of us was super into <i>50 Shades of Grey</i>,\u201d Stiles says. He has experience with this, and knows <i>exactly</i> the kinds of looks a man gets when he hauls around giant lengths of chain. \u201cThis is <i>definitely</i> getting back to my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow, and holds a length of chain up between his hands, testing its durability. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he muses, \u201cI think I\u2019d pick something a little more forgiving in that case. Wouldn\u2019t want you to bruise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cLike <i>I\u2019d</i> be the one chained up! You know perfectly well that you would be the one\u2014\u201c he cuts off abruptly as he realizes that an elderly lady at the end of the aisle is watching them avidly.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s shoulders shake, and Stiles hates him so, so much. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are going to the special hell,\u201d he hisses, keeping an eye on the old lady. She doesn\u2019t look familiar, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she isn\u2019t going to call his dad the second she\u2019s home to report about his son\u2019s deviant sex life.</p>\n<p>Which, granted, would be more funny to Stiles if he actually had any sex life to speak of. </p>\n<p>Then he realizes that if his dad barges into his room, he\u2019s probably going to find Derek Hale snoozing there, and glances back at the lady. He wonders if five bucks would buy her silence.</p>\n<p>Derek seems to realize what Stiles is thinking and grabs Stiles by the shoulder and leads him away, obstinately to find an employee to cut them a length of chain. The manhandling, Stiles thinks, is just going to make things look worse, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about it but hope word doesn\u2019t get back to the Sheriff.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until they\u2019re back in the car, a sack of iron chain settled on Stiles\u2019 lap, that he realizes that he\u2019d totally been flirting with Derek in the store.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s pack doesn\u2019t answer when he calls to check up on them \u2013 something that clearly bothers him, but he brushes it off casually enough that Stiles doesn\u2019t pick at it \u2013 and Scott reassures Stiles that they\u2019re working on the translation and that they haven\u2019t told their source anything they shouldn\u2019t have, so eventually they end up back at Stiles\u2019 house.</p>\n<p>Derek leaves his Camaro at his warehouse, and Stiles ignores the weird feeling he gets when Derek throws a bag with a change of clothes into the backseat of the Jeep. It\u2019s not the kind of feeling that he looks at too closely.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re quiet on the way to Stiles\u2019 house. Stiles for once doesn\u2019t feel the need to fill the silence with chatter, and just concentrates on driving. He glances over at Derek a few times, but Derek is staring out the passenger window, expression unreadable.</p>\n<p>Stiles dumps the bag containing the chain beside his desk, and Derek tries calling Isaac. No reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he like, required to answer your calls?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI thought having an Alpha was kind of like joining a creepy cult, and you\u2019re their Manson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to,\u201d Derek says. He tries calling Boyd. No answer. The same for Erica.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we go out looking for them?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI mean, Isaac was out being bait. What if he got caught?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. </p>\n<p>Stiles grabs his keys, but then he hears the front door slam shut. \u201cStiles?\u201d his dad yells up the stairs. \u201cYou up there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head no, and gestures towards the window. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe saw the Jeep,\u201d Stiles hisses back. Seriously, it\u2019s like Derek\u2019s forgotten that parents notice shit like that, especially when their profession is crime-solving and their son is the only family they have left.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d Derek mouths back, which means that Stiles\u2019 dad is nearing, Stiles takes a few flaily steps towards the door, then back. He feels like a chicken with its head cut off, and Derek looks annoyed.</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head again. He can\u2019t hide from his dad like that. It would worry him even more than he already is. Stiles feels guilty enough as it is, and he doesn\u2019t know how much longer this curse is going to last. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t lie to his dad every day.</p>\n<p>Derek glares and climbs out the window. Stiles tries to stay put by the door, but the pain lancing through his body is too intense, and he moves closer to the window, quickly kicking Derek\u2019s bag under the bed as he goes. He hears his dad hesitate outside his door, and Stiles quickly pulls the window mostly shut as quietly as possible, hoping Derek will stay close, and plops down in his armchair, pulling his phone out and tapping ineffectually at the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSon?\u201d his dad says, knocking on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Stiles asks in what he hopes is a completely normal tone. Not the tone of someone who just watched a werewolf jump out of his bedroom window in annoyance.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when his dad is physically inside his room that he remembers that he left the bag with the chain spilling out of the top of it sitting casually next to his desk in full view of anyone who happened to glance in that direction. Stiles wills himself not to look over there.</p>\n<p>He really wishes his dad did anything but police work, since he\u2019s pretty sure that other dads don\u2019t have the expert-level detection skills that his father possesses. He would notice if Stiles kept looking over, and Stiles is just lucky that he hasn\u2019t asked about Stiles\u2019 weird behavior over the weekend yet.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably coming, though. His dad has one of those awkward looks on his face, like he\u2019s about to ask a question that Stiles isn\u2019t going to like.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything you want to tell me?\u201d his dad asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I can think of?\u201d Stiles answers. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Devereaux called to complain about my son\u2019s perversions,\u201d his dad replies, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy perversions,\u201d Stiles repeats, wondering what deity he had to devote himself to in order to change his luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe went on at length about your inappropriate behavior with a, quote, darkly handsome young man,\u201d his dad said, looking like he was having entirely too much fun with this. \u201cSomething involving chains?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles forgets sometimes how similar he and his dad really are. He\u2019d be milking the shit out of a call like that too if it was his kid. He was just going to have to brazen this out. \u201cOh, you mean I didn\u2019t mention anything about that? I\u2019ve totally decided to start chaining up handsome young men in my spare time. I took the inspiration from my dad, who prefers handcuffs\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Outside the window he can clearly hear Derek making a choking sound. He really hopes his dad doesn\u2019t notice it.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d his dad replies. \u201cWhat mischief are you and Scott into? Please tell me I\u2019m not going to end up writing a report about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles says, trying desperately to think of an alibi. \u201cWe saw this video online\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad holds up a hand. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to know, because then I won\u2019t be legally obligated to investigate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWise choice, my man,\u201d Stiles replies.</p>\n<p>His dad smiles at him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles draws a cross over his heart. It\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t done in a while, and it\u2019s worth it to see the smile grow even wider on his father\u2019s face. \u201cI solemnly swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad sits down on the edge of his bed and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been around much lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has been grateful for how busy his dad has been, a fact that sends a dull stab of guilt through him. \u201cI\u2019m a big kid. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d his dad says, \u201cdon\u2019t do whatever you and Scott have planned in the woods, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cDid you find that girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d his dad says, \u201cbut another girl she was friends with has gone missing. I can\u2019t say more\u201c -- he holds his finger up when Stiles starts to protest \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s not looking good for either of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez,\u201d Stiles says. The guilt over the first girl is fading, and he\u2019s pretty sure that he knows which of her supposed friends has gone missing. The spellbook is sitting on his desk, and he\u2019s itching to look through it again.</p>\n<p>Find out what the witch who gave it to them died for.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m hitting the sack. I\u2019m gonna go back in early,\u201d his dad says, which means he\u2019ll be gone before the sun rises.</p>\n<p>Stiles stands and gives him a hug, and his father pats his back. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d He leaves the room.</p>\n<p>Stiles has a few moments to himself to collect his thoughts before Derek finally taps on the window. Stiles slides it open and Derek gracefully climbs back inside. Stiles would have stumbled and landed on his ass, but he reassures himself that it\u2019s probably just a werewolf thing. After all, Scott used to be almost as klutzy as Stiles and now he\u2019s a sports ace.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey killed her,\u201d he tells Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Derek replies. Stiles kind of wants him to refute it, say it was another girl, but there\u2019s no way. The witch who helped them out \u2013 even though they haven\u2019t figured out <i>how</i> yet \u2013 died for her efforts, and Stiles feels far guiltier about that than the witch that he watched Derek kill with his own eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to stop them,\u201d Stiles says. He still doesn\u2019t think the iron chain idea is going to work, but at least it\u2019s trying something.</p>\n<p>The coven isn\u2019t just targeting outside threats. They\u2019re taking out members of their own who defy them. That sort of power-hunger is terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard from Isaac.\u201d Derek is expressionless. \u201cThey\u2019ve given up for the night. Didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJackson made it out safe,\u201d Stiles says, checking his phone. \u201cSays he\u2019ll share what he found out tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Scott and Allison?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing from them, but that probably just means they\u2019re making out somewhere.\u201d Stiles would probably be doing the same, if he had someone to make out with, so he can\u2019t even sound too cranky about it. </p>\n<p>Derek sighs and sinks down on Stiles\u2019 bed, exactly where his dad was sitting a few minutes beforehand. \u201cWe need to figure out what she was trying to tell us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went through the whole book,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNothing about binding spells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks up suddenly. \u201cWhat if she wasn\u2019t trying to help us, but <i>warn</i> us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike\u2026\u201d Stiles stares at the book. \u201cLike there\u2019s something in there that tells us the coven\u2019s weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething worth dying over,\u201d Derek says, and it\u2019s so close to Stiles\u2019 earlier thoughts that it sends chills down his spine.</p>\n<p>Derek gets the book and starts to slowly flip through the pages, Stiles pulls off his flannel shirt and kicks off his shoes before joining Derek on the bed, sitting close enough that they can both peer at the pages and try to figure out which confusing phrase is the one that holds the secret they need to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas there anything about werewolves?\u201d Stiles asks, reaching out to turn another page. \u201cOr shifters of any kind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few spells in the back, I think,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt just looked like basic recognition stuff and something about control\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>He trails off and flips quickly to the back of the book. The pages here are slightly more worn, and there are a few penciled circles and lines scattered through the spells, like the witch had been studying it.</p>\n<p>And then, there it was. The spell for controlling werewolves. </p>\n<p>Well. It wasn\u2019t specifically for that. It was a spell for obedience that they\u2019d flipped past several times, ruling it unhelpful in figuring out why they were bound together. But now that they were focused on finding a spell that had anything to do with werewolves, it seemed almost too obvious.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuppressing the human aspect allows the animal side to take over,\u201d Derek reads aloud, \u201cthus allowing the spellcaster to take control of the beast and its power.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds cheerful,\u201d Stiles says, thinking about how close Derek came to losing himself completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d Derek says. He squints at a scribbled line penciled into the margin. \u201cIf I\u2019m making the right assumptions\u2026 if the witches are powerful enough and work together, they can tap into the pack\u2019s strength. Especially if they control more than one werewolf from the pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like\u2026\u201d Stiles peers at the book. \u201cShe didn\u2019t realize you were the alpha. There\u2019s no way a single witch would try to take on that sort of power, no matter how much she thought she was Bellatrix Lestrange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>Stiles jabs at the book, flipping to the next page. It was written in generalities, but now that they realized what they were looking at, it was easy enough to figure out the far-reaching possibilities of what it implied. \u201cLook. This is just talking about <i>beta</i> wolves. It says here that an entire coven has work together to control an alpha. The reason we got away was that the witch was working on outdated information and thought that you were just a beta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d Derek says.\u201dHe must have had contact with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to make assumptions, but when? He was Mr. Coma Guy. But there was another alpha\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister didn\u2019t deal with witches,\u201d Derek says in a tone that broke no arguments.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not making assumptions about your sister,\u201d Stiles says, holding his hands up defensively. \u201cBut\u2026 She had to get all that wolfsbane you inherited from somewhere, right? Somewhere like a magic store?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Derek sounds skeptical. \u201cBut that just doesn\u2019t sound like Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles agrees. Derek actually knew his sister, and Stiles isn\u2019t going to push it. \u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a look, like he knows that Stiles is just backing off for Derek\u2019s emotional stability, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>Then Derek grabs his hand, which is so sudden that Stiles lets out a truly embarrassing little squeak.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls his hand up towards his face, and for a long second Stiles thinks that he\u2019s going to kiss the back of his hand like a freaking Disney prince or something, and he freezes and just stares and braces himself against more involuntary squeaks.</p>\n<p>Then Derek twists his arm and looks closely at the scratch marks on the inside of Stiles\u2019 arm. Stiles stares at them blankly; they look better than this morning, but the vivid gashes are still violent-looking against Stiles\u2019 pale arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-no,\u201d Stiles says. He takes a calming breath; he\u2019s used to Derek. There\u2019s no reason that a little arm-touching should make Stiles all stuttery and nervous like a middle schooler at a dance.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek says, leaning in and sniffing it. Which is familiar territory, sure, but it\u2019s no less alarming. At least, the things that Stiles feels because of it are no less alarming.</p>\n<p>He tries to distract himself by saying, \u201cWhat, are you going to kiss it and make it better?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words come out shakier than he intends.</p>\n<p>Derek looks up, eyes bright, and says, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he leans in and licks a long stripe up a pale, sensitive strip of uninjured skin, tongue skirting the edges of the scratch. Stiles lets out an audible gasp, torn between pulling his arm away or pushing Derek\u2019s face in closer.</p>\n<p>Then Derek breathes in his scent again, breath cool against the damp skin, and Stiles bites his lip, trying his hardest to hold in his reaction. Then Derek repeats the process between the next two scratches, and it feels good. It feels really, really good.</p>\n<p>Stiles is dimly aware that he\u2019s got half an erection, and that Derek is licking and sniffing his arm, and there\u2019s a voice in the back of his head weakly reminding him that werewolves can smell arousal, but he doesn\u2019t care. He so doesn\u2019t care, so long as Derek never stops.</p>\n<p>Derek continues to lick and sniff and breathe on Stiles\u2019 arm, and Stiles almost bites through his lip, trying to hold in whimpers. His breath is coming fast, and when Derek looks up at him, mouth open, eyes gleaming almost wolf-wild, he looks more ruffled than Stiles has ever seen him.</p>\n<p>On the last long swipe with Derek\u2019s tongue, ending in the crook of Stiles\u2019 elbow where the skin is the most sensitive, Derek leans in and catches the skin lightly with his teeth, and that\u2019s it. Stiles lets out a groan, realizing he\u2019s straining against his jeans and the closest to undone he\u2019s ever been in the presence of another person. He should be self-conscious, he thinks, but he\u2019s too turned on to care.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes have fully gone over to wolf, and he pins Stiles to the bed. He\u2019s still holding Stiles\u2019 hand, and he pulls that up with him, grasping it loosely near Stiles\u2019 head, wounds displayed as he nuzzles Stiles\u2019 neck and then, meeting Stiles\u2019 eyes with his gleaming ones, presses down for a sloppy kiss.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s wet and forceful and tastes of copper, which Stiles realizes after a moment is his own blood from where he\u2019s bitten through his lip. Derek licks at that wound with the same intensity as he laved upon the Stiles\u2019 arm. Stiles keeps letting out these embarrassing, stuttering moans, like he doesn\u2019t know how to control his own voice, and Derek seems to take up more space than he should, surrounding Stiles and smothering him all at once.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks it might be a good way to go, being smothered by Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek lets out a little growl, pushing his body against Stiles\u2019, and Stiles responds in kind, pressing himself somewhat desperately against Derek\u2019s hips. He\u2019s thankful for the give in his jeans, thankful for the friction that Derek provides, as Derek breaks the kiss and continues nuzzling and licking his way down Stiles\u2019 neck and then back to his lips, drawn like a lodestone.</p>\n<p>Stiles is really, embarrassingly close to coming in his pants. Then Derek growls into the crook of his neck, the sound reverberating through Stiles\u2019 body like a thunderclap, and grinds hard against him. Stiles comes with a groan, hips straining up against Derek\u2019s, muffling the sound into his free fist.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes are almost completely animal now, and he ruts up against Stiles once, twice, three times before coming with a groan that\u2019s half-wild, like he\u2019s barely holding onto his human side.</p>\n<p>Their fingers are still interlaced, and Stiles is feeling uncomfortably sticky, but he doesn\u2019t move, just stares at the ceiling, uncertain about Derek\u2019s state.</p>\n<p> Derek nuzzles his neck a few more times, then releases Stiles\u2019 hand and rolls over, landing heavily on the bed beside Stiles. Stiles\u2019 heart is thumping like he\u2019s just ran a marathon, and he feels boneless. He wonders wildly if he just lost his virginity and isn\u2019t sure. It sure feels like he did, for all that he\u2019s still wearing his pants and is still untouched.</p>\n<p>He glances over. Derek\u2019s laying there, staring at the ceiling. Stiles can\u2019t really believe that he made Derek Hale cream his pants. It seems surreal.</p>\n<p>Derek is flexing his hands, and his teeth are elongated and his eyes still glowing, and Stiles isn\u2019t quite brave enough to break the silence. He thinks Derek came close to losing his control over his wolf, and Stiles is pretty glad that all of his braincells took a vacation in his southern hemisphere because if he\u2019d felt any fear, instead of just incredibly turned on, Derek might have gone completely over the edge. Stiles might apparently be into being pinned down by an Alpha werewolf, but he\u2019s definitely not into being ripped apart by one.</p>\n<p>A few minutes pass, Stiles enjoying the boneless, blissful afterglow, before he looks over at Derek again. Derek seems to have finally gotten himself under control, and is staring at Stiles with completely unreadable human eyes.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both in sticky, messy jeans. Stiles can\u2019t imagine having a meaningful conversation when he\u2019s covered in his own jizz, but apparently, Derek can.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that is the absolute last thing I wanted to hear,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI almost lost control. I <i>did</i> lose control,\u201d Derek says. He moves his too-intense stare from Stiles\u2019 eyes to his scratched arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that you already know it was mutual,\u201d Stiles says. On one hand, the amazing sense of smell werewolves have is super creepy and annoying, but on the other, Stiles suddenly sees a benefit to it. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI could have <i>bit</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does send a chill down Stiles\u2019 spine. He remembers the feel of Peter Hale\u2019s hand around his arm, his mouth closing in on his wrist, and the words, <i>you\u2019re lying.</i> \u201cI\u2026 That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could have,\u201d Derek insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI know what you\u2019re getting at. Trust me, I fucking <i>know</i>. But can we just\u2026 not? Not right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is still staring at Stiles\u2019 arm. \u201cThe connection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witch. She was using a spell to bind me to her,\u201d Derek explains. He points at Stiles\u2019 arm. \u201cBut I was in the process of forging a connection with you. That\u2019s why it backfired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI thought you broke that connection.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surely werewolf scratches don\u2019t give you sexy feelings about someone. Jackson never tried to jump Derek. Well, not that Stiles knows about, but he\u2019s pretty sure Derek couldn\u2019t have stopped himself from bringing that up often and mocking Jackson to hell and back.</p>\n<p>Though Stiles couldn\u2019t really say <i>how</i> he knows that about Derek, come to think of it. He just\u2026 does.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfterwards,\u201d Derek says, \u201cand I already told you I didn\u2019t really know what it would do, with me being an Alpha now. And at the time\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is really too sex-stupid right now to be connecting major mystery dots. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that when the witch tried the control spell, she connected herself to you, but you were clawing the shit out of my arm, so you were connecting to me, and when we broke the witch\u2019s connection, the spell kind of\u2026 mutated and connected us even more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBasically. I mean, I don\u2019t really know much about magical backlashes\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that sounds like the kind of mystical bullshit that could happen,\u201d Stiles says, \u201csince it\u2019s always made zero sense that a witch\u2019s dying spell would put you on the permanent buddy system instead of, say, the death and dismemberment she clearly thought you deserved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if we break the coven\u2019s power, then, if the book is right, the spell should fade,\u201d Derek says. He sounds relieved.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries hard to sound like the kind of guy who makes out with people all the time. \u201cFingers crossed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get cleaned up,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWill your dad wake up if we shower?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a long, strange second Stiles thinks Derek is suggesting a co-shower, but then remembers the curse and also how quickly Derek shut him down after the\u2026 bloodlust? Stiles wasn\u2019t really sure what to call what came over Derek\u2026 faded. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>This leads to one of the most extraordinarily awkward showering experiences of Stiles\u2019 life. He tries not to check Derek out because of the awkward ending of the whole thing that happened a few minutes ago, but Stiles kind of can\u2019t help it, because <i>they totally made out</i>. Even though he knows it\u2019s weird now and not in a good way, Stiles\u2019 body didn\u2019t get that memo and tingles appreciatively with the memory of Derek\u2019s body pressing down hard against his own.</p>\n<p>Stiles considers himself in pretty good shape \u2013 he might not have washboard abs, but he\u2019s lean and has enough muscle that the endless lacrosse practices aren\u2019t a big deal, even for someone who doesn\u2019t really have hope of actually seeing action on the field. Derek on the other hand is built like a freaking mack truck, and Stiles wonders how many hours of working out Derek has skipped since they were cursed, since a body like that <i>has</i> to require upkeep, even if it belongs to a werewolf.</p>\n<p>He knows he\u2019s being completely obvious, but\u2026 it\u2019s not like Derek doesn\u2019t know that Stiles thinks he\u2019s hot. Stiles freaking rubbed himself off on Derek\u2019s leg not an hour ago. </p>\n<p>Stiles stares down at his arm while Derek is in the shower, and wonders for the first time if that would have happened if Derek hadn\u2019t scratched him. They\u2019re bound together, that much is clear, but how much of their bonding has been a result of supernatural forces, and how much of it has just been Derek and Stiles?</p>\n<p>The thought rests in his mind uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>When he undresses for his shower, far more clumsily than Derek managed, he can feel Derek\u2019s gaze on him, but he doesn\u2019t look at him. Stiles thinks that if he looks at Derek, all the things he\u2019s feeling will come pouring out, and then he couldn\u2019t meet his eyes ever again. The only thing saving him from a fate of death-by-embarrassment right now is the firm, secure knowledge that the hook up was mutual.</p>\n<p>They cross the hall back to Stiles\u2019 room in silence, Stiles walking as noisily as always and Derek moving with silent footsteps that his father, if he happened to be awake, wouldn\u2019t notice.</p>\n<p>Stiles climbs into his side of the bed, dressed fully tonight in pajama pants and a t-shirt. The bed seems even smaller than it had the previous night, when Stiles had been so hyper-aware of every inch that lay between him and Derek. Derek slides into bed wearing just his boxers, and Stiles resists the urge to spray Febreeze around to dissipate the scent of sex that even he can notice.</p>\n<p>And if Stiles can smell it, it has to be stifling to Derek, but he says nothing.</p>\n<p>Stiles shifts uncomfortably. He desperately wants to say something, but nothing really seems appropriate, so he mostly stares into the dark and pretends like he can\u2019t feel Derek settling into the bed beside him with marked casualness. </p>\n<p>Somehow this is way, way worse than last night\u2019s awkward boners. Stiles misses the sexy feelings, in fact. It was better than the strange feeling in the pit of his stomach, like he\u2019s fucking something up that should have been simple and easy and perfect.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns over on his back. The room is light enough that he can make out Derek\u2019s profile beside him, also staring at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is dumb,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek turns to look at him. Stiles can just make out the shape of his cheekbone, and his hair is strangely flat from his shower. He looks\u2026 younger. Less intimidating. Stiles can do this. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook, let\u2019s just...\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t want to say \u2018pretend it never happened,\u2019 because\u2026 well, he\u2019s not even sure why. He can barely even bring it up with Derek. \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. I would say pinky-swear to keep it in our pants, but we already managed that.\u201d Derek snorts. \u201cHow about we pinky-swear to keep our tongues to ourselves? Just until the curse is lifted and\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles trails off. He doesn\u2019t know where that last bit came from, or why it came out sounding so plaintive. He doesn\u2019t have a crush on Derek. Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have lost control like that,\u201d Derek says. \u201cEven just the transition to Alpha doesn\u2019t explain it. \u201d He reaches out, like he\u2019s going to retrace the scratches on Stiles\u2019 arm, then stops himself. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I didn\u2019t entirely eradicate the effect of the scratch. The wolfsbane failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The pit in Stiles\u2019 stomach feels like it just opened up a direct route into Mordor. He opens his mouth a few times, trying to figure out how to phrase it, but then it comes out in a rush of words. \u201cHow much of\u2026 it\u2026 was the connection? Do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is silent for a long time. When he finally speaks, his voice is quiet and sad. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wordlessly holds out his pinkie, knowing Derek can see it clearly in the dark. After a second, Derek reaches out and hooks his pinkie with Stiles\u2019 and shakes firmly.</p>\n<p>Stiles felt a slight pang of regret as they unhook their fingers and quietly settle in for the night, even though he knows this is the only possible thing to be done. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamn, you bitches are hard to find!\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles flails and falls out of bed, getting hopelessly tangled in his comforter in the process. It takes him a long, annoying minute to figure out how to free his legs enough to sit up while also trying to suss out why there\u2019s a girl yelling at him in his own freaking bedroom.</p>\n<p>Then he blinks blearily at the figure by the window and of course it\u2019s Erica, hands on her hips, silhouetted against the dim morning light.</p>\n<p>He has another blind moment of panic about his dad coming to investigate before remembering dimly his father yelling \u201cSee you later!\u201d through his closed bedroom door a few hours earlier, when it was still dark out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to address your alpha,\u201d Derek says while Stiles is still processing everything, because of course he\u2019s someone who can come up with a dickish comeback immediately after being rudely woken.</p>\n<p>Erica, he realizes suddenly, is disheveled and filthy, with leaves stuck in her wild hair and dirt smeared across one cheek.</p>\n<p>No, not dirt. Blood. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>She ignores him and glares at Derek. \u201cI\u2019ll address my alpha anyway I want, when he fucking abandons me to a bunch of crazy murderers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t abandon you,\u201d Derek says sharply. \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey got Boyd,\u201d she says, raking her hands through her hair and dropping leaves and twigs on Stiles\u2019 floor. \u201cThere was a trap for us, out in the woods. We walked right into it, me and Boyd. Followed their scent right to it. A goddamn circle of stones, and once we were inside, it flared up.\u201d She shudders. \u201cThey took our phones, and then a couple of them started doing a spell. They focused on Boyd first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably thought he was stronger,\u201d Derek muses. He\u2019s sitting up in bed, the sheet loosely covering his legs, and yet he still looks commanding.</p>\n<p>Erica raises an eyebrow. \u201cThey\u2019re witches. I don\u2019t think they underestimate lady-power.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. He\u2019s shirtless, and Stiles absolutely does not notice the way his muscles ripple. Definitely isn\u2019t distracted from the murder and mayhem by the curve of Derek\u2019s shoulders and the way the dim light highlights his abs\u2026</p>\n<p>Fuck. That\u2019s worrying. Stiles focuses his attention on Erica. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s still hard for people with limited exposure to our kind to wrap their heads around the fact that we\u2019re all so much stronger than we look,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s instinctive to view the larger animal as the more threatening one, especially if they don\u2019t know much about pack females.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cThey managed to turn Boyd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn him?\u201d Stiles asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s theirs.\u201d Erica looks a little lost now, like she doesn\u2019t quite understand how it worked. \u201cI can\u2019t feel him at all anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. He\u2019s got the feeling that this is the kind of pack stuff that Derek doesn\u2019t want any of the non-wolves \u2013 really, any of the non-Pack, since Scott doesn\u2019t know either \u2013 to know.</p>\n<p>Derek goes quiet for a moment, looking for all the world like he\u2019s about to start meditating with his eyes closed and everything drawn inward, and then he jerks his head up, panic written clearly in his eyes. \u201cThey have Isaac, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Erica says. She bites her lip, looking suddenly younger. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice is quiet but demanding. Stiles leans against the side of the bed, not wanting to distract anyone by actually moving.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter they got Boyd, they took off with him. Just told him to come with them and he did, like it was the most natural thing in the world,\u201d Erica sounds bitter, and Stiles remembers again how eerie Derek had appeared for those horrible seconds he\u2019d been under the witch\u2019s command. He realizes for the first time that Erica and Boyd are friends, that their pack is their entire family and social group all mish-mashed into one, and he can\u2019t even imagine how awful it would be to watch someone that important to you be taken over. \u201cAnd they left me with two of the younger witches. A guy and a girl. And I saw an opening, so I started squirming around like I had to pee, said I was too embarrassed to go with a guy there, and then managed to talk the girl into taking me into the woods before I pissed my pants.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t help the snort that escapes, and is surprised when Erica actually grins back at him. </p>\n<p>Derek glares at them both and motions for Erica to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo she ties me up with some rope that\u2019s got wolfsbane or something entwined in it, fucking <i>magic</i>, and it burned like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt before.\u201d She pulls up the sleeves of her leather jacket to show angry-looking rope burn around her wrists. \u201cBut I knew I couldn\u2019t let them take me over. I can\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t lose control of myself. I can\u2019t feel helpless again. Not after everything I\u2019ve done to\u2026\u201d Erica trails off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Derek says gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I hit her over the head,\u201d Erica says, looking proud.</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of a one-trick pony, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help the dig. He really can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt works,\u201d Erica replies, giving him an altogether too smarmy smile. \u201cSo I knock her out, and suddenly the guy\u2019s throwing a fucking rock at me. It hits me in the cheek, and I can see he has more, so I drop like it actually hurt me, and took him out with his own damn rock when he came to drag me back to the circle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods in approval.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Erica says, sounding annoyed again, \u201csince the other witches took our phones with them, I got to traipse my tired ass all over Beacon Hills looking for my Alpha, who definitely wasn\u2019t in his HQ like he\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you about the curse,\u201d Derek says defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you were all snuggly-buggly with that jockstrap while your pack was\u2026.\u201d Erica pauses, sniffing the air. \u201cOh my god, you ditched your pack for <i>hanky panky</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that if his face gets any hotter, someone could actually fry an egg on it. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere were complications with the spell,\u201d Derek says stiffly. His face is unreadable.</p>\n<p>\u201cComplications involving your dick distracting you from your pack,\u201d Erica replies. She doesn\u2019t sound mad, precisely. \u201cYou could have picked a better time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t really\u2026\u201d Stiles begins, but doesn\u2019t actually have anything constructive to complete the thought with. He flails his hands trying to somehow convey the fact that he and Derek aren\u2019t together and last night isn\u2019t something to talk about and really, all those times Stiles imagined waking up to two hotties after losing his virginity, it went down way differently.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not open to discussion,\u201d Derek says finally, giving Erica one of those weird commanding Alpha looks that Stiles, by virtue of not being a mythical creature, thinks are just super creepy instead of, you know, something to actually obey.</p>\n<p>Erica gives Stiles a measuring look, and he shifts uncomfortably. He realizes that his scratched-up arm is on display, and Erica\u2019s eyes hone in on it. \u201cI see,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you learn anything about the coven?\u201d Stiles asks, hoping to distract her. \u201cLike maybe what they\u2019re planning on doing with two pet werewolves? Or a street address to their secret lair?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica shakes her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cWe have to get them back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIsn\u2019t that probably what they want? I mean. They\u2019re systematically destroying your power base here and weaponizing it. That kind of screams \u2018trap\u2019 to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>And his dad claims that video games will never come in useful.</p>\n<p>Derek and Erica both raise an eyebrow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, is the eyebrow thing something that comes with the bite? Because your twinsie thing there is freaking me out.\u201d Stiles glares at them both. \u201cAnd also, I am awesome at strategy. You seriously didn\u2019t think that Scott was the mastermind, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless,\u201d Derek says, glaring, \u201cwe have to get them back.\u201d He turns his attention on Erica. \u201cCan you lead us back to where they captured you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica nods. \u201cI was there all freaking night, so yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go scent them out,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t sound like fun to Stiles. That sounds like he\u2019s going to be stumbling after two werewolves in the woods. But he doesn\u2019t actually have any better ideas. \u201cYou do realize the last time you were sniffing around the woods, you got caught,\u201d he points out to Erica.</p>\n<p>\u201cLive and learn,\u201d she says. Stiles sighs and stands up, managing to get away from the tangle of blankets with a smidgeon of grace.</p>\n<p>Erica smirks at his pajama pants, which happen to be a Robin pair that Scott bought him, because Scott sometimes gets it in his head that he\u2019s a hilarious motherfucker.</p>\n<p>Stiles glances down and says defensively, \u201cWhat? They were a present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMastermind, indeed,\u201d Erica says.\u201dMore like perma-sidekick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the groupie,\u201d Stiles says, which is mean. Almost as mean as the slap-fight that Erica totally instigates.</p>\n<p>Derek buries his head in his hands. \u201cCan you two please act like you understand that we\u2019re in danger here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe started it,\u201d Stiles says at the same time that Erica points at him and says, \u201cI\u2019m not a damn groupie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDress like it,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t shop in the kiddie section,\u201d she grumbles back.</p>\n<p>Stiles wonders if Erica was this fun back when she was an outcast. She totally could have hung out with him and Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might want to wash that blood off your face before we go anywhere,\u201d Stiles tells her. \u201cYou look like you were raised by wolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her shoulders shake with suppressed laughter, and she grins widely. \u201cYeah, well, you look like you were\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Derek says, giving her the evil eye. </p>\n<p>Stiles can pretty much guess what verb Erica was going to offer, and he\u2019s glad that he doesn\u2019t have to go over the whole him-and-Derek-are-not-a-thing all over again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBathroom down the hall?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the left,\u201d Stiles says. Once she\u2019s gone, he changes into jeans and his usual layering of shirts, while Derek gets dressed, opting for black and grey. Stiles wonders if the red hoodie he shrugs on was a bad choice for sneaking around the woods in the daylight, but then again, it\u2019s not like the witches aren\u2019t expecting them.</p>\n<p>They load a few supplies into the Jeep, including the iron chain and the spellbooks. Erica directs them to a spot in the woods just a little ways off from where the original witch\u2019s circle was. Stiles drives as far off-road as possible, trusting that two werewolves could manage to get his jeep out of any unexpected ditches that are entirely possible this deep in the woods, but finally has to park next to a steep embankment.</p>\n<p>\u201cUp and over,\u201d Erica says, and they follow her up the embankment. Stiles keeps sliding, sometimes out of range of the spell, which adds pain and misery to the soul-crushing embarrassment of being the only one in the group who can\u2019t manage to scale twenty feet of dead leaves, loose dirt and rocks without falling on his ass.</p>\n<p>Derek grabs his hand and hauls him to the top after watching him flail like a morn, and Stiles spends a few moments at the top brushing leaves and dirt off himself and pretending like he didn\u2019t get stupid little butterflies in his stomach when Derek held his hand.</p>\n<p>He trudges after Derek, and Erica pats him knowingly on the shoulder and mouths, \u201cHe likes you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives her his best, \u201cWhat?!\u201d face, and then checks to make sure Derek hasn\u2019t noticed. He\u2019s moving stealthily a few feet ahead of them, pausing at intervals to sniff the air.</p>\n<p>Erica taps the side of her nose and nods.</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his hands out all, <i>are you fucking with me</i>.</p>\n<p>She shakes her head and cuts her eyes to Derek\u2019s back. His shoulders are stiff, and he\u2019s looking around the forest like he\u2019s trying to find something to kill.</p>\n<p>\u201cSexual tension,\u201d Erica mouths. \u201cTotally gonna explode.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d Stiles mouths back, and seriously, he can\u2019t even control his brain-to-mouth filter when he\u2019s not even speaking aloud?</p>\n<p>Erica snorts, and Derek whirls around. Stiles tries really hard to look innocent, which means that he looks even guiltier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were trying to find our missing pack?\u201d he says in an altogether too-calm voice. Erica was totally right, Stiles realizes. Derek\u2019s been acting slightly off all day, and he doesn\u2019t think it has to do with anyone\u2019s dick. Mostly. Probably.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing your pack,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Erica rolls her eyes. \u201cGive the boy a gold star.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, waving his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re all\u2026\u201d He mimes a growly face and pretends to claw the air. \u201cYou told Scott that you gained power from leading a pack, and half of your pack has been magically ripped away from you. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so unstable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks. \u201cI\u2019m not unstable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him his best <i>bitch, please</i> facial expression. The one he culled from <i>Clueless</i>. \u201cWhat about the whole\u2014\u201c he waves his hand around, unwilling to say \u201cdangerously wolf-y dry humping\u201d in front of Erica. </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s expression only shifts a little, but Stiles knows he\u2019s right. \u201cThat\u2026. It makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Erica says. \u201cAre you playing this Alpha business by ear? How long have you even been Alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives her a questioning look. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know he\u2019s only been Alpha for like, five minutes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been longer\u2026\u201d Derek begins defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you started biting people pretty much the second Peter was in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Erica contemplates this for a moment. \u201cThat actually makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was born a werewolf,\u201d Derek explains, giving them both the evil eye. \u201cI don\u2019t need as much of a learning curve as made werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica nods, and Stiles does too, just to reassure Derek. Now that he\u2019s realized why Derek\u2019s been volatile, he doesn\u2019t really want to push him as hard. Especially since he doesn\u2019t know what a young Alpha on the edge might do. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was this way,\u201d Erica says after a moment, pointing to the left. \u201cSee? I left a little bit of blood on that tree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t see anything, but Derek nods. He grabs Stiles\u2019 sleeve and hisses, \u201cKeep up. We\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles kind of thinks that they\u2019re all equally screwed if the coven shows up, but Derek has his fierce, protective face on, and Stiles accepts that Derek and Erica are more capable of standing up to a foe than Stiles himself is. He just nods and follows along, trying to make as little noise as possible.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious when they reach the spot. The rocks still form a rough circle and there are scuffle marks in the leaves coating the ground. Stiles has snuck enough looks at police reports, and, okay, watched enough CSI to know that a struggle occurred on the site.</p>\n<p>Erica freezes just before they get to the circle and holds an arm out. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Stiles asks, looking around at what appears to be woods. They look like every other spot in the woods he\u2019s ever been dragged to, which is a lot, given how disdainful werewolves as a whole seem of staying indoors. He wonders briefly if Scott would wear a \u201cWerewolves are tree huggers\u201d t-shirt, but then realizes that Derek and Erica are both staring up. \u201cOh. You mean the giant freaking voodoo doll hanging from the tree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a voodoo doll,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s a message.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey could have emailed,\u201d Stiles says, staring. The thing appears to be made of bone, he realizes. And it\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>The skull isn\u2019t human. Stiles doesn\u2019t really want to know if it originally was a Fido or one of Derek\u2019s non-human brethren, but the fangs and elongated head send a clear message, alright.</p>\n<p>Erica\u2019s mouth is open. \u201cThey haven\u2019t\u2026 I mean, you\u2019d know if they killed anyone, right? Isaac and Boyd are okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really\u2026 I just don\u2019t know. I think Isaac and Boyd are okay.\u201d Derek stares at the bones for a long minute, then turns and starts walking back towards the Jeep. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take them down. No more screwing around. We\u2019re getting our pack back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d Erica says with a hungry expression. Stiles follows, a cold, hard feeling in his gut telling him that this is probably going to end badly.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even remember school was today,\u201d Stiles says, staring at the high school from the driver\u2019s seat of his Jeep. They\u2019d just dropped Erica off at the warehouse, where she was prepping the last few details before they attempted to take on the coven. The reality of what they were about to undertake was really setting in, and they had all three been unusually quiet on the ride home. Erica had been instructed to pick up phones to replace the ones that the witches had stolen.</p>\n<p> She\u2019d looked scared shitless, but determined as they drove off. </p>\n<p>Stiles drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying to focus on the trivial so that he didn\u2019t have to think about being in the middle of a giant supernatural brouhaha. \u201cI really don\u2019t need more unexcused absences on my record.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be more worried about not being killed horribly by magic?\u201d Derek replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIdeally, that would be the main goal of today, yes,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cBut there\u2019s also something to be said for having long-term goals, like, for instance, not having the school call my dad about my truant ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad loves you,\u201d Derek says. There\u2019s a note of something sad and quiet in his voice. Stiles has never heard him talk about his parents, but he recognizes grief when he hears it. He reaches out to\u2014he\u2019s not sure. Pat Derek on the shoulder? Touch his hand? \u2013 but hesitates, hand hovering uncertainly above the Jeep\u2019s gearshift.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at it, and Stiles makes a decision. He reaches out and squeezes Derek\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe pinky-swore,\u201d Derek mumbles, brow furrowed as he stares at their linked hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo French hand-holding, then,\u201d Stiles says, waggling his tongue for a second for emphasis before seeing Derek\u2019s expression. He rubs his thumb soothingly against Derek\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll save them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope,\u201d Derek says. He tightens his grip on Stiles\u2019 hand, to the point where it almost hurts, and then, like he\u2019s afraid Stiles is going to pull away, lifts their hands and places a quick kiss on Stiles\u2019 thumb. \u201cWe have to break the coven\u2019s hold on them. On everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Stiles says. He can feel the ghost of Derek\u2019s kiss on his finger. \u201cNow, um. How do you normally sneak into school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sneak in,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou go here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re pretty, with a brain like that,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cI might go here, but you sure as hell don\u2019t. What am I going to say, \u2018Sure, Mr. Harris, this handsome twenty-something is absolutely one of the seniors. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen him lurking about the bleachers.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t lurk.\u201d Derek actually looks put out as he climbs out of the Jeep. \u201cI observe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotato, Pa-tah-to,\u201d Stiles says breezily. It\u2019s much easier to pretend like his gut isn\u2019t twisting nervously when he\u2019s throwing out harmless quips. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never been hunting,\u201d Derek explains as he leads Stiles on an evidently familiar-to-him circular route around the fringes of campus, weaving their way towards the main building of the school.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never watched <i>To Catch A Predator</i>,\u201d Stiles teases back. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully familiar with the locker room, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous?\u201d Derek\u2019s grin is bright and does funny things to Stiles\u2019 everything. He stumbles just a little bit, and brushes off Derek\u2019s helpful hand on his elbow.</p>\n<p>They actually do end up in the locker room, which keeps sending Stiles into helpless snickering fits when he sees Derek\u2019s wry face. They spend a few minutes dicking around, Stiles snooping unapologetically in other people\u2019s lockers while Derek looks on disapprovingly, when dude, he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t even go to this school.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Derek says finally, when Stiles tries on a hilarious hat he finds in one of the lockers. \u201cThat thing smells.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything in here smells,\u201d Stiles says. He tilts his head, showing off the hat. It has bobbles on it. \u201cIt\u2019s a locker room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pushes him up against the end of the locker bank and moves in close, crinkling his nose. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know what it smells like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, jesus,\u201d Stiles says, and jerks the hat off. Derek is close, one hand still on Stiles\u2019 shoulder, and Stiles weakly waves the hat around. \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek leans in close and rubs his nose gently along the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Stiles says, then tries to pretend like his knees haven\u2019t suddenly gone watery. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty flimsy pretext for sniffing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back, and Stiles stares at his lips. They aren\u2019t all bitten and chapped like Stiles\u2019 lips. Derek\u2019s lips are appealing, and Stiles leans forward, curious to see if they\u2019re as soft as Stiles remembers. Then he remembers the way that Derek\u2019s stubble rubbed against his face, and yeah, Stiles is going to kiss him. He won\u2019t use tongue. That\u2019s totally within bounds.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes are dark and he\u2019s actually leaning in, like he can sense Stiles\u2019 intent, and is not only willing to go along with Stiles but is willing to instigate the kiss. His breath is hot on Stiles\u2019 face, and Stiles thinks his heart might actually leap out of his chest, it\u2019s beating so hard. Their lips meet with the lightest of touches, barely brushing, and just as Stiles is pressing up into it, the familiar loud clang of the locker door echoes through the room. Derek doesn\u2019t move, like he doesn\u2019t even register that someone\u2019s entered the room, but Stiles jerks his head back, banging it painfully against the lockers.</p>\n<p> Jackson swaggers in with Danny in tow, and he freezes when he sees Stiles and Derek. He gives a questioning look, then smirks. \u201cInterrupting something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hey, just the douchebag royalty we were looking for,\u201d Stiles says a little too loudly as Derek releases his shoulder and leans menacingly against the lockers, like he\u2019s interrupted from pinky-forsworn kisses every day. Danny is looking back and forth between Stiles and Derek with a slightly confused expression, and Stiles does his best to not meet his eye. He\u2019s really regretting telling him that \u2018Miguel\u2019 was his cousin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like you were looking real hard for me,\u201d Jackson says, because Jackson is clearly the biggest jackass ever. Stiles glares. \u201cI mean, you only would have found me if I was in Hale\u2019s pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny punches him lightly in the arm. \u201cDude, chill. I think he might die of embarrassment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is nothing to die of embarrassment over,\u201d Stiles grinds out. He kicks at Derek\u2019s leg. \u201cTell them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just says, \u201cJackson, we need to talk. You know what about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson makes a face. \u201cThat mission you sent me on really sucked. You led me to believe there were hotties, and all I found were old hippies. One dude offered to give me a ride in his VW.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you take it?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Jackson glares and doesn\u2019t bother to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid any of them appear to be the leader?\u201d Derek asks. Stiles isn\u2019t sure where he learned his interrogation techniques. Stiles could totally do better himself. But Derek has the whole I-can-punch-through-concrete-so-I-don\u2019t-even-care-that-you\u2019re-a-creepy-lizard-monster stance down, and Stiles really prefers that the monsters he interrogates be properly chained and restrained first. So he\u2019ll let Derek handle this one.</p>\n<p>Jackson sighs. \u201cThey were all second-stringers. But when they went to the backroom to discuss something, I heard them talking about calling a Rookwood for permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThea?\u201d Stiles asks, because there\u2019s no way that she would be of help, unless they had an Ouija board.</p>\n<p>Jackson shakes his head. \u201cAlma? I think they said Alma.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Derek asks. </p>\n<p>Jackson nods. \u201cThey mentioned her a few times. Sounded like they were her minions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods curtly and strides out of the locker room. Stiles trails along after, though when Danny offers out his hand for a low-five as he passes, Stiles totally goes for it. Then Danny mouths \u201cCousin?\u201d at him with a knowing smirk and Stiles turns, walking backwards to keep pace with Derek, and mouths, \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bumps into Derek, who has stopped at the entrance of the locker room, and Stiles, pretending like he didn\u2019t just almost fall on his ass, sweeps past him out the door.</p>\n<p>They go out to the lacrosse field. Stiles sits down at the end of the second row of bleachers, but Derek stands next to them, hands shoved in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cif you apologize every time that something happens between us, it\u2019s going to wreak havoc on my self-esteem. Just so you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Stiles says. He holds out his arm. The scratches are healing, though Stiles can\u2019t tell yet if he\u2019s going to have a scar. It would look badass if he did. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you ravished me or something. I was the one trying to kiss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek points at Stiles\u2019 arm. \u201cYour motives are suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no way that I would independently arrive at the conclusion that kissing you might be awesome,\u201d Stiles replies bitterly, shoving his sleeve down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never have before,\u201d Derek says stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your nose broken?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI think you\u2019re hot. I know you know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we only act on it after the spell?\u201d Derek snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we actually got to know each other,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd you stopped threatening me with violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe the unknown mystical quantity tying us together is screwing with us,\u201d Derek grits out. \u201cI can\u2019t take that chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to,\u201d Stiles manages to reply, frustrated and angry because Derek keeps bringing up the exact thoughts Stiles is trying his hardest to ignore. \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to consider that it might not. This spell isn\u2019t going to last forever. It\u2019s not even going to last the rest of today, if this plan works. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to forget me.\u201d</p>\n<p>A soft expression takes over Derek\u2019s face, but before he can reply, his phone buzzes. He checks it, and his face hardens again. \u201cGet Scott and Allison. Erica\u2019s found a witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t like\u2026 going to torture her for information, are we?\u201d Scott asks worriedly from the backseat as they zoom towards the meeting spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do what it takes,\u201d Derek says sternly. Stiles glances at him out of the corner of his eye. He\u2019s like ninety percent sure that Derek is just testing Scott, to see what his response is. Derek is kind of a dick.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo torture,\u201d Allison says firmly. Scott nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd no harming my pack,\u201d Derek says. He gives Allison\u2019s crossbow a significant look. She tightens her grip on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about no torture, we could make Scott try to howl at the witch,\u201d Stiles offers, grinning broadly to try and disperse the tension that\u2019s filling the car uncomfortably. \u201cThat would totally make her give up the coven\u2019s secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott punches him in the shoulder. Allison sighs, and turns to Derek, like he\u2019s the only available beacon of responsibility and maturity in the car. \u201cWhere did Erica find the witch at?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHardware store,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t given any details, just that she nabbed the witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re trusting that\u2026\u201d Allison catches Derek\u2019s glare and cuts herself off. \u201cErica with something that important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe managed to rescue herself when she got captured,\u201d Derek points out. \u201cAnd she\u2019s trustworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>They arrive at the pull off in the woods where Erica\u2019s at, and the first thing Stiles notices is a big honking dent in the back quarter panel of Derek\u2019s Camaro.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrustworthy,\u201d Scott says, grinning.</p>\n<p>Derek is staring at the car like he\u2019s never seen it before, and when he carefully climbs out of the Jeep, Stiles scrambles after him because he\u2019s pretty sure that the spell kicking into effect would only amplify the decidedly murderous feelings Derek obviously has.</p>\n<p>\u201cErica,\u201d Derek says in an eerily calm voice. \u201cWhat happened to my car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe witch is in the trunk,\u201d she replies, eyes darting nervously. She crinkles her nose when she spots Allison and Scott. \u201cThere was a struggle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA struggle,\u201d Derek repeats. He looks closer. \u201cDid you throw a witch into my car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSelf-defense,\u201d Erica replies quickly. \u201cTotal self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison steps up closer to the trunk and presses her ear against it. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anything. Do you think she\u2019s awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cNo. But we have to get to the site.\u201d</p>\n<p>He motions for Allison to get out her crossbow, and they crowd around the trunk as Erica opens it.</p>\n<p>A middle-aged dude wearing tie-dye is squished inside the Camaro\u2019s compact trunk. His legs are tucked up against his body fetal-style, and his arms are tied behind his back with what appears to be a twisted-up plastic bag. There\u2019s a dirty sock shoved into his mouth, which Stiles can see that Erica stole off the man\u2019s own foot. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the witch?\u201d Scott says, sounding disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you expect a sorority girl in a Halloween costume?\u201d Erica asks, rolling her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOurs was,\u201d Stiles says, just to make Scott feel a little better. Or worse, maybe, considering that the witch Erica found looks more like he should be selling weed to hacky-sack players.</p>\n<p>Allison reaches out and checks his pulse. \u201cHis heartbeat is steady,\u201d she says. Stiles appreciates Allison for pretending like checking the pulse manually wasn\u2019t redundant for three members of the group, who all probably knew that already from their creepy preternatural hearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, you carry the witch,\u201d Derek says. \u201cErica, get the supplies. Allison, keep your bow on him. If any of us hear him waking, be prepared to put an arrow in him. Somewhere soft.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison nods, though Stiles notices that she doesn\u2019t notch her arrow into firing position. Scott hauls the man out of the trunk, and they traipse through the woods to the spot that Derek picked out.</p>\n<p>They bury the iron chain in a circle, and deposit the witch inside after securing him to a chain that\u2019s attached to a metal stake driven into the ground in one sharp movement by Derek. They loosely fan out around the circle, though Stiles has to stick close to Derek for obvious reasons. It wasn\u2019t like he really brought a lot to the fight, though. Stiles knows perfectly well that he is no match for anyone here, including the dude chained up like a dog. </p>\n<p>Then they wait. And wait.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, nice weather we\u2019re having today,\u201d Stiles says, shifting and wondering if it would be in bad form to just sit down and wait, because it wasn\u2019t like he was doing much on guard duty anyway. \u201cHeard it might rain, but nope, just a few clouds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolls his eyes at him from across the circle. \u201cReally? The weather?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m trying to lighten the mood here,\u201d Stiles grumbles. \u201cI mean, this whole thing is a little more pre-meditated than I like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s getting murdered,\u201d Derek says, exasperated. He continues watching the witch with a steady, cold look. Stiles thinks it might be his hunting face; there\u2019s something just outside the range of normal human emotions in those eyes, like he\u2019s already mentally ripped the man apart, and is now just waiting on an opportunity. It clashes terribly with Derek\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Allison says, threat evident in her voice. She taps her crossbow against her thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d Stiles asks plaintively. He doesn\u2019t want a shootout at O.K. Corral before the bad guys even show up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about how you and Derek smell like each other?\u201d Scott asks. There\u2019s an undertone to it, something Stiles isn\u2019t used to hearing in Scott\u2019s voice. Stiles thinks it might be jealousy, which doesn\u2019t even make sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm well we\u2019ve been magically tied to each other all weekend,\u201d Stiles says truthfully. \u201cThat\u2019s probably it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, not entirely truthfully. Stiles can\u2019t really believe that he\u2019s not even been able to keep an ill-advised hookup secret for a whole twenty-four hours. He hasn\u2019t even been able to keep it down to one or two people. Pretty much everyone Stiles know has guessed it at this point. Stiles is never, ever going to play poker with these people. Ever. He\u2019d end up naked and broke two hands in.</p>\n<p>Scott raises a sassy eyebrow, which, what the hell. Apparently it really is a werewolf superpower. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flails his arms around and says, \u201cI have no idea what you mean. None. And shut the hell up, Erica.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Erica says, even though she knows <i>perfectly well</i> what she was doing with her face, the jerk.</p>\n<p>Derek, who is also a jerk in Stiles\u2019 book for not helping one single bit, just stands there looking for all the world like he can\u2019t hear the conversation happening. He is literally looking off into the trees. Stiles glares at him, because, seriously, way to throw him under a bus, alpha.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you two would be a cute couple,\u201d Allison offers, because apparently Allison is also secretly evil. Stiles really should have suspected this. She was already genetically susceptible to evil, clearly, and science always wins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m rooting for the witches,\u201d Stiles grumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Derek says finally, and everyone drops it. Just like that. Stiles hates everyone, up to and including Derek, for being able to sound both commanding and sort of fragile the same time like that, because it makes Stiles\u2019 heart clench in confusing ways.</p>\n<p>The only person who doesn\u2019t seem to realize that they need a distraction is the witch, who is still passed out on the ground like it\u2019s the perfect time for a nap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow hard did you hit him, anyway?\u201d Allison asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t knock him into next week or anything,\u201d Erica says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I hope not,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s car begs to differ,\u201d Scott mutters, like he\u2019s taking joy in the fact that Derek got some collateral damage out of the whole thing. Stiles gives him his best, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d look, and Scott gives him a bitchy look that Stiles clearly remembers from the time that Stiles didn\u2019t tell him about the girl Scott crushed on freshman year mentioning Scott in conversation.</p>\n<p>Then Stiles abruptly realizes that Scott is annoyed because he had to sniff out the fact that Stiles lost his v-card, when, what the hell. It\u2019s not like Scott sent out an owl when he lost his. Stiles exaggeratedly frowns at him, and Scott crinkles his nose back derisively, and so Stiles clearly has no choice but to blow a raspberry in Scott\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Then he realizes that everyone else is staring at them. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all jealous of our deep abiding friendship,\u201d Stiles tells them. Scott cracks a grin, which Stiles takes as a good sign.</p>\n<p>Erica sighs loudly and points at the witch. \u201cCan someone kick him or something? Anyone got a bucket of water?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks around and sees a stick that looks long enough. He prods at the witch, who groans and rolls over. A few more good prods, and the witch opens his eyes, which are dark-circled and rheumy. He groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Derek asks. He\u2019s got his arms crossed like he means business; Stiles kind of stands awkwardly off to his side and tries not to fidget too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot telling you that,\u201d the witch wheezes out.</p>\n<p>Erica strides forward and puts a boot on his crotch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWalt,\u201d he immediately chokes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrude, but effective,\u201d Derek tells Erica, like he\u2019s a teacher critiquing her coursework.</p>\n<p>She steps back outside of the circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWalt,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI just need you to answer a few questions for us, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? You gonna kill me, like you did that sweet little girl?\u201d Walt pushes himself into a sitting position and spits derisively on the ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot the adjectives I would have chosen to describe her,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one deserves to have their throat ripped out by a monster,\u201d Walt snaps, body practically vibrating with anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one deserves to have their will ripped away,\u201d Derek replies calmly, but Stiles can see the way his hands are shaking. He wants to reach out and somehow soothe Derek, remind him that the witch had signed her own death warrant the moment she attacked an alpha werewolf with magic, but he can\u2019t undermine Derek like that in front of the prisoner. \u201cWhere are my wolves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yours anymore,\u201d Walt says, smiling to reveal a mouthful of too-bright white teeth. They look out of place with his grizzled, hippie exterior, and Stiles wonders for the first time how powerful the man actually is. All the werewolves he\u2019s ever met have presented themselves as predators, with the exception of Peter when he was still pretending to be a vegetable, and Stiles thinks that they might be ill-equipped to deal with people who hide their power with fragile exteriors.</p>\n<p>Erica growls, her eyes shining bright gold and fangs elongated. Walt doesn\u2019t even flinch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are my wolves?\u201d Derek repeats, punctuating each word with a menacing pause. He\u2019s leaning forward slightly, the tips of his ears sharp. His eyes are still human, though, Stiles thinks, not for long.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn their way,\u201d Walt smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be finding out any secrets from me, killer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins broadly, like he\u2019s actually a charming person or something. It\u2019s eerie, even to Stiles, who appreciates Derek as a person. \u201dIt\u2019s awfully nice of Alma to send me exactly what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walt\u2019s smile wilts. \u201cWho\u2019s Alma?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour coven leader? Alma Rookwood?\u201d Derek\u2019s smile doesn\u2019t fade, and Walt frantically looks around the circle. Erica is smirking, Allison is checking her crossbow with marked casualness, and Scott is staring intently at Derek with an unreadable expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 You don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Walt says.</p>\n<p>\u201cLying,\u201d Erica sing-songs. \u201cHis heart rate is spiking through the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand her being upset about her\u2026 daughter?\u201d Derek looks at Walt a second. \u201cYes, her daughter\u2019s death. It was unfortunate, but unavoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunate?\u201d Walt squeaks. It\u2019s clear even to Stiles that his heart is still pounding, and Stiles wonders what kind of woman this Alma really is, if she has witches at her beck and call, and if she raised someone like Thea. \u201cWe saw what you did to her, monster. Murdered in her youth, and her body desecrated. Put in consecrated ground, sharing dirt with a stranger. It was monstrous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica crinkles her nose. \u201cOh my god, did you <i>dig her up</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe wolf did it for us,\u201d Walt says. He\u2019s clearly trying to regain his composure, but Stiles thinks there\u2019s still something off about him now.</p>\n<p>He\u2026</p>\n<p>He\u2019s terrified. Not of Derek, not of the wrath of the wolves. But of his own coven leader.</p>\n<p>Then Stiles realizes. \u201cYou know, Walt,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re totally screwed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walt gives his bound hands a significant look and says, \u201cThese won\u2019t hold me forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably should hope they do,\u201d Stiles says. Derek shoots him a confused look, but Stiles continues on. \u201cGiven that, you know, your coven leader is going to think that you sold her out. Seeing how we suddenly know her name and everything, right after having a conversation with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walt pales.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a jazzy Vanna White move, throwing the interrogation back to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe really interesting thing here, Walt,\u201d Derek says, \u201cis that I don\u2019t want information from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Walt clears his throat and asks hoarsely, \u201cThen what do you want me for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek crouches down, steepling his hands and resting his chin on them. He looks every inch the predator he is. \u201cBait.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re left waiting until dusk.</p>\n<p>When the sun starts to set, the forest suddenly has a creepy vibe that raises the hair on the back of Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you guys feel that?\u201d he asks, looking around. Walt is crumpled in the center of the circle of iron, right where he fell after Derek punched him once they were sure they got the last bit of useful information out of him, which wasn\u2019t much. Everyone else is standing just within the circle, which is their only line of defense against the biggest unknown of the night: witchcraft.</p>\n<p>Scott nods. \u201cIt feels like a storm is coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic,\u201d Derek confirms. </p>\n<p>Allison rubs the back of her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s spooky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica snaps her head to the right, sniffing. \u201cFive plus Isaac and Boyd.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison notches an arrow in her crossbow. Stiles tries to look confident, despite the fact that he brought diddly-squat to a big old supernatural fight. Maybe he should pick up a rock or stick or something. </p>\n<p>\u201cRemember the plan,\u201d Derek says, voice calm and quiet. He\u2019s actually a good leader when the shit is about to go down, Stiles notices, and wonders if he could somehow translate his abilities to peacetime efforts. Then Stiles realizes that he\u2019s making plans to help Derek better lead his pack, like they mean something to each other, and hates himself a little.</p>\n<p>Derek whips his head around, staring at something off to the left of them. He holds out a warning finger, and Stiles watches as Scott and Erica change into their game faces, stances turning more predatory as they all wait for the attack.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been given strict instructions to stick close to Derek so that the spell doesn\u2019t kick in. Stiles has painfully vivid memories of just how incapacitating the spell is, and he knows that Derek stands no chance of winning against the coven and his turned wolves if he\u2019s brought low by Stiles screwing up. It\u2019s a major responsibility, even though it feels like just standing around.</p>\n<p>The awful tension in the air keeps rising, and Stiles worries that the witches might actually manage to spell them. The iron chain lies unseen under half an inch of dirt and leaves, but Stiles isn\u2019t completely convinced that it\u2019ll be effective. He remembers how intense the magic felt when Thea tried to control Derek, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that it can be contained by something as simple as iron.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a low growling coming from the forest to the left of them, and Stiles would put money on there being another werewolf to the right. The hair on the back of his neck is now <i>crawling</i>, and Stiles keeps trying to brush off things that aren\u2019t there, it feels so real. It\u2019s getting harder to breathe, with the air so thick with a strange current, and Stiles tries his best to remain calm. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow?\u201d rasps Scott through a mouthful of sharp, wicked teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet them come to us,\u201d Allison instructs. She looks around the circle. \u201cRemember, keep close. We have the advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s taking who?\u201d Erica asks, looking from side to side. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Boyd,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou and Scott, focus on Isaac.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t give a command to Allison. Stiles thinks it\u2019s probably as close to diplomatic he can get for dealing with an Argent.</p>\n<p>There are a few more long moments of the mystical energy coming to a boiling point, and the wolves all seem to be feeling it even worse than Stiles is. Derek finally stretches his arms and shifts, cracking his neck from side to side, and he looks straight into the woods and roars out a chilling, terrible howl.</p>\n<p>The sound resonates through the trees, sending the few birds that have remained through the magical atmospheric disturbance flying, and it feels like it pulsates right into Stiles\u2019 very skin and settles with a rattle deep in his bones. The scabbed-over scratches on his arm throb, and Stiles takes an unconscious half-step closer to Derek.</p>\n<p>It inexplicably makes him feel safer, the same way he always felt as a kid when his dad arrived home from patrol.</p>\n<p>There is a moment of perfect stillness after Derek\u2019s howl finishes echoing through the woods, where the magic in the air seems to lessen and the goosebumps on Stiles\u2019 arms fade completely away, and not a single creature stirs in the woods. All Stiles can hear is his own heart pounding in his chest, and the way that his friends are breathing heavily around him, tensed and ready for battle.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s an answering howl from the forest, though by the way that Derek\u2019s shoulders tense, Stiles can tell that the message that\u2019s being sent isn\u2019t friendly. It\u2019s a challenge, instead of the cry of submission that an Alpha should receive from one of his betas. It raises the hackles of the wolves around Stiles, though it doesn\u2019t do anything to Stiles himself.</p>\n<p>Derek roars, this time making no pretense at it being anything less than a battle cry, and Erica and Scott both drop to their knees, eyes glowing wild and claws scratching into the earth as they reposition themselves, awaiting Isaac and Boyd\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p>Quick as lightning, Boyd emerges from the foliage. He vaults over a fallen log and then, dropping to all fours, springs at Derek. </p>\n<p>In theory, sticking close to Derek seemed simple enough. Stand behind him a few feet and let him work his werewolf kung fu until all the bad guys were taken out.</p>\n<p>In practice\u2026 Stiles uses up his entire reservoir of badassery on just staying upright rather than dropping to the ground and scampering away like a terrified crab.</p>\n<p>It feels like the entire clearing has exploded with action, even though Isaac is still lurking in the forest. There are snarls from all sides and when Boyd crashes into Derek, they go tumbling into the dirt. Stiles takes a few steps to the left and the right, doing his best to avoid contact with the sharp claw-tipped blows that go wild, all while keeping close enough that Derek retains his advantage.</p>\n<p>Erica moves in once to claw a deep gouge on Boyd\u2019s ankle as he attacks Derek, which slows him down momentarily. Allison fires off an arrow which embeds deep in Boyd\u2019s abdomen, but he seems to not even feel it.</p>\n<p>Stiles realizes suddenly that Boyd hasn\u2019t spoken since he burst into the clearing. Granted, no one else has exactly been reciting soliliques, but mixed in with the grunts and snarls have been single-word commands and curses and \u201cOver here!\u201ds.</p>\n<p>Boyd, though\u2026 He\u2019s only grunted and growled and, once, when the arrow hit him, let out a startled yelp like an injured dog.</p>\n<p>Stiles stares at him. His eyes are glowing a fierce yellow, and his wolfed-out face is ferocious, but there\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s no human intelligence behind it.</p>\n<p>Even his fighting seems to be pure instinct, with no clear battle plan. He\u2019s obviously going to lose; the only reason he\u2019s still alive is that Derek is fighting to incapacitate, not kill, and has instructed Scott and Erica to keep out of it as much as possible, keeping their eyes constantly scanning the forest for both Isaac and the witches.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s feral,\u201d Stiles says, unwilling to look away from Boyd now that he\u2019s realized exactly how dangerous he is. \u201cThey took the spell too far. They took away his will, and with it, what kept him human.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows Derek hears him even through the battle-lust because his shoulders suddenly stiffen and his entire stance changes. He charges at Boyd, taking the offense for the first time, and pins him, jerking one of Boyd\u2019s arms behind him and managing to push his face into the dirt, putting a knee in the small of his back and leaning in. He sinks his teeth into the back of Boyd\u2019s neck, deep enough that bright red blood trickles down his skin.</p>\n<p>Boyd stills, and Stiles realizes that Derek\u2019s switched tactics. He\u2019s letting his wolf-side dominate, and Stiles thinks he\u2019s possibly humiliating Boyd into submission. Stiles is pretty sure, from his internet research and comparison to Scott and Derek\u2019s behavior, that werewolves have a slightly different set of conduct than actual wolves have.</p>\n<p>Boyd is still straining up against Derek, but he\u2019s not lashing around as much, and Stiles notices that while the gash Erica contributed is mostly healed, all the other cuts are still vivid and bleeding. Derek, on the other hand, is mottled with fading bruises, and the few cuts seem to be already scabbing up.</p>\n<p>Derek is still Boyd\u2019s Alpha, then. Despite the shift in control, the physiological response to an Alpha is still the same, and Boyd\u2019s unwilling submission means that somewhere deep inside, he\u2019s still there. Still part of the pack.</p>\n<p>Something comes crashing out of the woods, and Stiles drops to the ground just as he realizes that it\u2019s Isaac. An arrow catches Isaac in the throat, and Scott slams into him before he has a chance to jerk it out. Scott\u2019s at a disadvantage, Stiles knows, since any injury he inflicts is going to heal quickly, rather than human-slow like Derek\u2019s blows. Stiles fervently wishes that everyone hadn\u2019t resoundly agreed that he wasn\u2019t allowed any sort of projectile weapon earlier, for fear that he would hit one of them instead of a bad guy. It\u2019s frustrating, not being able to do anything to help his friends.</p>\n<p> He checks back on Derek and Boyd. Derek is talking quietly into Boyd\u2019s ear, leaning in close. He\u2019s speaking too softly for Stiles to hear, but their position is strangely intimate. Stiles thinks he should be jealous, but somehow, it doesn\u2019t bother him. He wonders why, briefly, then realizes it\u2019s because Boyd is part of Derek\u2019s pack, and Derek should be close to them. They\u2019re his family, and abruptly, Stiles realizes exactly why Derek\u2019s so desperate to bring Boyd back to himself.</p>\n<p>Derek loves his pack. That\u2019s why he\u2019s willing to go as far as he is to keep them safe. They\u2019re the only family he has, and Stiles of all people should understand the need to form a family.</p>\n<p>Stiles is pulled from his thoughts when to his right, Erica suddenly leaps into the fray, helping Scott with Isaac. Stiles has to admire the fact that she\u2019s probably the most vicious fighter of the three. Scott\u2019s got the most experience, and it shows in his level of control, but Isaac is working on pure instinct, his face monstrous. Stiles bites his lip, hoping that Scott makes it through okay.</p>\n<p>Allison sidles up to Stiles, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t fire any more without risking Scott or Erica. It\u2019s too fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abruptly, Stiles looks around. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Allison asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cThe magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison\u2019s jaw drops. \u201cOh, shit. The witches have stopped trying their spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances around. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison looks doubtful. Erica slides past them, then vaults herself back towards Isaac. The struggle is taking longer than it should; Scott\u2019s never had any trouble taking Isaac down before. </p>\n<p>Derek seems to have finally given up on talking sense into Boyd, and knocks him out with a single, sharp blow. Boyd\u2019s laying just a few feet from Walt, and Stiles stares at the unconscious witch for a minute as something clicks into place for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey should have rescued Walt already,\u201d Stiles hisses, grabbing Allison\u2019s arm. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have sent feral wolves right at someone they were going to rescue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve abandoned him,\u201d Allison says, staring at him. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek pushes past them into the fight. With his strength added to Scott and Erica\u2019s efforts, it only takes a few more seconds to take Isaac out, leaving him on his back in the dirt, head lolling to one side. Derek doesn\u2019t bother trying to talk him back into his senses, Stiles notices. That must mean the coven\u2019s control is too great.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a low thrumming, and Stiles looks around. It sounds like a generator, but there\u2019s nothing like that out this deep in the woods.</p>\n<p>Then he realizes that it\u2019s the buildup of the spell abruptly returning. \u201cIt\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDown,\u201d Derek says, and they all drop to the ground. Derek is close enough to touch, and it takes all of Stiles\u2019 willpower to not reach out and grab his hand.</p>\n<p>He can see Scott crawling to get closer to Allison, just as the thrumming reaches its zenith.</p>\n<p>The spell shatters through the air. It feels like the kind of thunder that rattles your bones and windowpanes alike, Stiles thinks, and protecting himself with his arms, ducking his head down and praying that none of the trees surrounding them fall.</p>\n<p>Limbs crack and he can feel the wind whirling around, but nothing else happens. After a minute, Stiles lifts his head, and the circle is unscathed. </p>\n<p>Derek slowly climbs to his feet, and yells into the forest, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to bring more than that!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s terrible, insofar as action hero lines go, but Stiles feels a deep, bubbling well of affection for Derek nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Stiles pushes himself up off the ground, and looks around. Outside the circle, there are a bunch of downed limbs, but nothing fell inside it.</p>\n<p>He thinks the chain actually managed to work. </p>\n<p>He has a scant moment to appreciate the triumph before he realizes why the wolves are all three tense and staring off to the right. There\u2019s something shuffling in the brush, and then a lone figure appears, stepping between two low-hanging branches.</p>\n<p>\u201cRookwood,\u201d Derek says, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cHale,\u201d the woman who can only be Alma Rookwood replies. She\u2019s middle-aged and lovely, with an aura of power crackling around her that even someone as completely human as Stiles can feel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI found something of yours,\u201d Derek says, motioning towards Walt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd two other little somethings of mine, too,\u201d Rookwood says, motioning towards Isaac and Boyd.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s smile is as sharp as his claws. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing it too far, witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d she smiles, \u201cI haven\u2019t begun to push. You killed my daughter. Desecrated her corpse. I\u2019m going to rip away everything you love and leave you begging for death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t really do your research on that one, did you?\u201d Allison mutters, and Stiles chokes back a hysterical giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelease my wolves,\u201d Derek replies with a snarl, \u201cor I\u2019ll rip <i>you</i> apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat fun would that be?\u201d There\u2019s something deeply unsettling about Rookwood\u2019s eyes. Stiles is reminded of Kate Argent, bizarrely enough, and worries suddenly that Derek might see the similarities too.</p>\n<p>\u201cLots,\u201d Erica offers with a sharp-fanged smile.</p>\n<p>Derek has his arms crossed across his chest. He looks dangerous, and Erica and Scott move to either side of him, both with their game faces still on. Stiles stands just behind them, close enough to keep the spell from triggering, and exchanges a look with Allison.</p>\n<p>He knows she\u2019s smart enough to tell exactly how unhinged this witch is, just for choosing to go after an entire pack of wolves, but she also understands how powerful the witches actually are. It\u2019s a terrible, insidious type of power, and Stiles worries that they don\u2019t stand a chance of breaking it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are they coming?\u201d he asks her quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe need to wrap this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles definitely doesn\u2019t want to be caught out here when the hunters arrive. It\u2019s the chanciest part of the plan \u2013 breaking the coven\u2019s strength is going to be difficult, and right now it\u2019s looking even harder than they anticipated, and knowing the hunters are on their way to take out the same coven\u2026 </p>\n<p>It gives them a chance they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise, knowing that backup \u2013 unlikely as it may be, especially since the hunters don\u2019t <i>know</i> that they\u2019ve been lined up as a second line of defense in case the werewolves fail \u2013 is on its way, and it means that if they time this right, they can take a chance that otherwise would be impossibly risky.</p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Stiles wants to actually still be here when the hunters show up. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour blood is mine,\u201d Rookwood was saying, and Stiles has seen enough superhero cartoons to know when a truly epic villain rant is about to be thrown his way. </p>\n<p>But there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s learned from his many years of geekery, and that is the fact that villains love to talk about their motivations. His experiences with Peter didn\u2019t diffuse this notion, so he calls out, \u201cWhy did you try to take over the pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rookwood pauses. \u201cBecause they killed my daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, \u201cI killed your daughter because she was trying to control me. Why was she doing that? It never made sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were supposed to be a beta,\u201d Rookwood says, narrowing her eyes at him.</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes at her. \u201cIt\u2019s my territory. Mine. I wouldn\u2019t send someone else out to investigate an unknown trespasser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not much like your sister at all, are you?\u201d Rookwood says abruptly.</p>\n<p>Derek stiffens, looking like he might burst through their only line of protection and lash out at the witch immediately. Stiles actually reaches out to touch Derek\u2019s back reassuringly, trying to ground him and remind him why they were staying inside.</p>\n<p>The Alpha couldn\u2019t fall. Allison\u2019s crossbow wouldn\u2019t do much to stop him, were he turned against them, and Stiles for one didn\u2019t want to face him down.</p>\n<p>Derek meant too much to him. He couldn\u2019t\u2026 he just couldn\u2019t stand the thought of Derek having his control ripped away and turned into a monster. </p>\n<p>Stiles can feel how rigid the muscles in Derek\u2019s back are through his shirt, and he splays his fingers out, stopping just short of anything that could be construed as petting. Derek takes a few sharp, deep breaths, and then says in an unwavering voice, \u201cI don\u2019t see how you would know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSweet Laura was too trusting,\u201d Rookwood says, stepping closer to where Stiles knows the chain is buried. She holds a hand out, like she\u2019s feeling the range of the circle, and says, \u201cUnlike you, it seems. She used to stop by our store. Lonely thing, she was. I was under the impression she didn\u2019t have any family left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to have paid close attention to her,\u201d Derek says. His voice is steady and even to someone who knows him as well as Stiles does, he seems calm. The tenseness in his back belies his outward calm, though, and Stiles risks stroking his back, trying to unwind him.</p>\n<p>It seems to help. Derek loosens his stance a little, and Stiles pulls his hand back slowly, not wanting to draw the witch\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cWerewolves are easy to spot,\u201d Rookwood says, \u201cespecially you born ones. None of you are quite human enough. And when Laura died\u2026 well. I saw an opening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn opening.\u201d Derek\u2019s no longer calm; there\u2019s a dangerous lilt to it. Beside Stiles, Allison tightens her grip on her crossbow.</p>\n<p>Erica takes a half-step forward, clearly wanting to act on the threat in her alpha\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hales have held this town for far too long, pup,\u201d Rookwood says. \u201cWith Laura gone\u2026 well, I was under the impression that her brother was just a kid, staying as far away from here as possible. Bad memories, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott growls.</p>\n<p>Derek holds out a hand, stopping Scott from taking a step forward. Stiles thinks that there\u2019s some sort of werewolf thing happening, with the way that Erica and Scott are reacting to digs at Derek, and he hopes that Derek isn\u2019t losing control of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had to know another Alpha would take her place,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe never formed a pack,\u201d Rookwood says. \u201cI assumed\u2026 well. Your little pack did come as a surprise to me, though not a threat. Where did you find such terrible wolves at?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica lets out a snarl, crouching like she\u2019s about to spring at the witch. Stiles tenses, thinking that maybe he can grab onto her belt or something if she tries to attack. He\u2019s painfully aware that the thin iron chain is all that\u2019s protecting them from the coven\u2019s formidable magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as easy to control as you hoped, are we?\u201d Derek says, surprising Stiles. He\u2019d expected an angry snarl, and instead, Derek seems to have centered himself again.</p>\n<p>Stiles wonders why. He looks around.</p>\n<p>At first he doesn\u2019t see it, but then he realizes that the other four witches have surrounded the circle. They\u2019re still in the underbrush, mostly hidden behind branches and foliage, and they\u2019re\u2026</p>\n<p>They\u2019re just watching. Stiles can\u2019t sense any more magical disturbances, and though, granted, he\u2019s not an expert, so far the magic hasn\u2019t exactly been the most subtle weapon on earth.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re watching, but they aren\u2019t acting. Beside him, Allison notices that he\u2019s not looking at Rookwood anymore, and he can tell when she spots the rest of the coven.</p>\n<p>Her brow furrows. She looks at Stiles, and he shrugs.</p>\n<p>Rookwood starts in on a rant about how the werewolves have been in control of these lands for too long, and her voice has the shrill, demented edge of someone who has lost base with all reality. Stiles stares back into the woods, and one of the witches moves closer to the edge of the clearing.</p>\n<p>The expression on her face is pure horror.</p>\n<p>Just like that, Stiles knows that the witches hadn\u2019t realized that their leader had slipped into insanity. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you sent your daughter to take over a wolf,\u201d he says loudly, hoping that they\u2019d already heard enough of Rookwood\u2019s rantings to understand how far gone she was. \u201cYou fired the first shot. We acted in self defense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be an Alpha,\u201d Rookwood cries, her voice cracked and ragged now. She raises her hands, and Stiles can feel power building between them. Too much power for one person, he thinks. </p>\n<p>The coven\u2019s magic. He looks back at the other witches, and they\u2019re no longer trying to conceal themselves. They\u2019ve stepped into the clearing, advancing on Rookwood slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you killed that girl,\u201d Stiles says, sensing the tipping point is near. The other witches stop, turning to look at him. \u201cThe nice witch who tried to warn us against you, when we went to the magic store. She disappeared right after that.\u201d He turns to the rest of the coven. \u201cWe had nothing to do with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told us they attacked without provocation,\u201d one of the witches says to Rookwood.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey did,\u201d she shrieks. \u201cThey killed my girl!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour girl tried to control a werewolf alone,\u201d another witch says. \u201cThat\u2019s forbidden for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rookwood spreads her hands out. The magic she\u2019s building seems to have manifested itself; there\u2019s a bright, glowing light there now, one that Stiles can\u2019t look at without seeing spots dance across his vision.</p>\n<p>\u201cI regret that she died,\u201d Derek says quietly, turning from Rookwood for the first time since she emerged from the forest. \u201cBut I was given no choice. And none of my pack have harmed any of yours, no matter what <i>that</i> says.\u201d He throws a disgusted look at Rookwood.</p>\n<p>The oldest of the four witches, a woman Stiles faintly recalls seeing at the magic store, looks him in the eye. \u201cDo you speak the truth, boy? By the moon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the moon,\u201d Derek says solemnly. Erica and Scott still have their attention trained on Rookwood, though Allison is wavering between all the witches, with her crossbow gripped tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd our brother?\u201d another of the witches ask, motioning towards Walt.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust knocked out a little,\u201d Stiles offers. \u201cNothing unfortunate happened to him at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison\u2019s phone buzzes, and she looks, vaguely panicked, around. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that the hunters aren\u2019t going to work on a no harm-no foul system. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe formally apologize for grievances we\u2019ve caused your pack,\u201d one of the witches begins, and then suddenly drops to her knees, clutching her head. </p>\n<p>Rookwood laughs, loud and mad, as she releases the magic that\u2019s built up in her hands. Stiles drops to the ground, Derek beside him and Allison crouched nearby, her crossbow aimed at Rookwood.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a strange sense of tension, as though the invisible barrier of the circle is wavering, and then, suddenly, there\u2019s chaos as the barrier falls.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like the entire world is crashing down around them, and Stiles instinctively reaches out and grips Derek\u2019s hand, holding on as tight as he can as the magic fills the air to the point that Stiles can\u2019t even breathe.</p>\n<p>And then, abruptly, it\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up cautiously, and Rookwood is clearly gearing up for a second wave. She\u2019s chanting quietly to herself, stepping forward over what used to be the iron chain, but now all that remains is a charred circle.</p>\n<p>The other witches are scrambling to their feet, looking dazed as they try to come up with a spell to counteract whatever Rookwood is about to do. It\u2019s clearly deadly; the other witches look panicked. </p>\n<p>And then Allison pulls herself to her feet. Stiles sits up slowly as Derek lets go of his hand. And as Derek climbs to his feet\u2026</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a strange whistling sound, and then suddenly the shaft of an arrow is sticking out of Rookwood\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>For a second Stiles remembers vividly what her daughter looked like as she died, blood gushing from her throat. The boneless way that Rookwood\u2019s body slumps, blood bubbling out around the bolt, is eerily familiar.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a quiet moment of shock. </p>\n<p>The witches, clearly still recovering from the shock of the magic attack, collectively gather around Rookwood\u2019s body and stare, dazed.</p>\n<p>Derek steps closer, and motions for Erica and Scott to come with him. Stiles puts his hand on Allison\u2019s arm, but she shakes it off, still staring at the bolt in Rookwood\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour leader is dead,\u201d Derek says, voice cutting through the silence like a scythe. \u201cDid that break your coven\u2019s hold on my wolves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny spells that were done with the coven\u2019s collective magic are broken,\u201d one of the witches says, turning pale as she realizes the ramification this has on her group. \u201cYour wolves are your own again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do you the favor of warning you,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHunters are coming, and they want you dead. Run.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 Alma\u2026\u201d One of them says, staring at the body. </p>\n<p>Stiles get the impression that witches as a whole experience a lot less death and terror than werewolves and their associates. </p>\n<p>\u201cRun,\u201d Derek snarls, and the witches, with several regretful looks, gather up Walt and flee.</p>\n<p>Allison finally lowers her crossbow, hand visibly shaking and gestures towards the still-unconscious werewolves. \u201cGet them out of here. The hunters are almost here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even remember to check whether the spell on him and Derek has been broken as he helps Derek, Scott and Erica haul Boyd and Isaac away from the circle.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until they end up in separate vehicles going back to town \u2013 Stiles in his jeep, Boyd filling up the backseat and Scott beside him, while Derek and Erica take Isaac in the Camaro \u2013 that Stiles realizes that he\u2019s not in soul-crushing pain, and thus, breaking the coven\u2019s power actually did break the spell.</p>\n<p>It seems too simple, somehow. Too neat. He realizes that he never really expected it to work, and that he\u2019d been somehow\u2026 hoping it wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird to not be with Derek, given how they spent the last three days in constant proximity. He keeps glancing over at the passenger seat and it\u2019s bizarre that it\u2019s Scott sitting there, instead of Derek, who should be glowering about nothing in particular. He misses Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou and Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pretends like it doesn\u2019t startle him as much as it does. \u201cNo longer magically enforced buddies!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was talking more about the whole\u2026 situation between you two,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThe way you are totally in love with him and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t hide his startlement this time. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s\u2026 What? Scott, that is crazy talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gives him a look. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Stiles repeats. </p>\n<p>Scott leans over and <i>sniffs</i> Stiles\u2019 neck, getting all up in there and snuffling against his skin, which, \u201cHey! Inappropriate! The hell, dude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re carrying Derek\u2019s scent,\u201d Scott says triumphantly, pulling back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, I\u2019ve been magically tied to the dude for days! It\u2019s not like we could properly maintain personal space bubbles,\u201d Stiles sputters out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell like him because you\u2019ve been living with him 24/7. You\u2019re carrying his scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has no fucking clue what the difference between those is, and tells Scott so.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026\u201d Scott waves a hand around carelessly. \u201cHow me and Allison carry each other\u2019s scents, but me and you don\u2019t. There has to be\u2026 heightened emotion and contact to transfer this kind of scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the hell did you become a scent-expert?\u201d Stiles asks, trying to ignore the fact that apparently to every single freaking werewolf, he and Derek smelled like they were dating. It gave him a strange, twisty feeling deep inside, like it should be something good but instead it was just\u2026 depressing.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s lessons,\u201d Scott admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cNormally, I would be delighted that you\u2019re using someone\u2019s own knowledge against them,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut mostly I\u2019m just annoyed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you trying to keep it secret, anyway?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cI think it\u2019s cute that you\u2019re dating Derek. It\u2019s very\u2026 Xander and Cordelia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t dating,\u201d Stiles chokes out. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour neck says otherwise,\u201d Scott points out, tapping his nose.</p>\n<p>Stiles steers with his elbow for a moment so he can jerk up the sleeve to his shirt. The healing scratch marks on his arm are vivid even in the dark car. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026 marked you?\u201d Scott sounds confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why the spell connected us,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe was grabbing my arm when the witch cursed us, and somehow it ended up on the two of us instead of the two of them. He marked me, and there was a magic spell holding us together, and all of a sudden there\u2019s something going on between us? That doesn\u2019t sound the slightest bit suspicious to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott stares at the scratch marks with new understanding. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. We both think that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Scott says. He sounds disappointed. \u201cBut\u2026 you two just have this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, since when?\u201d Stiles says bitterly. \u201cIt was just a cruel twist of magic, Scott. Nothing real.\u201d</p>\n<p>They drove the rest of the way to Derek\u2019s in silence.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cSo has anyone noticed that when we all get together, group murder ensues?\u201d Stiles asks as he helps Scott pull Boyd out of the Jeep. He really feels that focusing on murder is preferable to anyone talking about his and Derek\u2019s\u2026 whatever.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting pretty good at it!\u201d Scott says optimistically.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, maybe we can put it on our resumes one day,\u201d Stiles says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAt least we didn\u2019t have to bury this one,\u201d Scott offers as Derek\u2019s Camaro pulls up. \u201cThat part\u2019s gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah it is,\u201d Erica agrees, climbing out of the passenger seat. \u201cWhy\u2019d we ditch Allison with a fresh corpse, anyhow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s using it to prove herself to her parents,\u201d Scott says. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll ease up on her then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stops, letting Boyd\u2019s feet thump to the ground. Scott continues to drag him, not even noticing that Stiles isn\u2019t helping anymore. \u201cDid you come up with that on your own? That\u2019s actually a decent bit of manipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott awkwardly balances Boyd on one arm in order to flip Stiles off. \u201cIt was Allison\u2019s idea. She figures that since her family was hunting the coven anyway, saying that she decided to go out and try to help them would win some brownie points.\u201d Scott smiles goofily. \u201cProm\u2019s coming up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison\u2019s parents would ease up on her because she killed someone?\u201d Erica says blankly. \u201cAnd I thought my mom was a fucked-up parent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause she killed a monster,\u201d Stiles clarifies. He catches Derek\u2019s eye, and immediately looks elsewhere. Like the floor. Man, concrete is interesting. Way more interesting than Derek\u2019s strangely sad look.</p>\n<p>Scott gets Boyd arranged somewhat comfortably on an old couch, and Erica sets Isaac up nearby, and then that\u2019s it. The adventure\u2019s over. They all stand around awkwardly for a moment, and Stiles totally catches Erica and Scott clearly giving each other \u201cLet\u2019s leave them alone,\u201d looks, so he grabs Scott\u2019s hand and says, \u201cIt\u2019s been real,\u201d and fucking <i>flees</i> towards his Jeep.</p>\n<p>Scott hisses, \u201cStiles, seriously dude,\u201d but Stiles isn\u2019t interested in making small talk or whatever. He has to leave here before he actually <i>looks</i> at Derek, or, god forbid, has to talk to him.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t handle that. Not when he\u2019s already feeling strange and adrift, like the spell breaking did more than just cut the leash between them.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Scott doesn\u2019t push the topic on the drive home, just talks aimlessly about the homework they have in Econ, and how Scott covered for Stiles during his missed lacrosse practice even though he had to deal with Coach Finstock congratulating him on being such a thoughtful boyfriend to Stiles. Scott keeps checking his phone for news from Allison, and Stiles keeps his eyes firmly on the road, hands at ten and two, and basically does everything in his power to focus on anything but what just happened.</p>\n<p>He drops Scott off, getting a promise to let him know if Allison\u2019s okay, and Stiles drives home numbly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s stupid, he knows. They\u2019ve been working nonstop for days to break the curse, and now it\u2019s broken. Stiles should be dancing around his room, fist-pumping and freaking howling at the moon in celebration.</p>\n<p>Instead he just trudges upstairs and flops on his bed, staring at the ceiling. He glances over. There\u2019s still an indention in the other pillow where Derek slept. He tries to ignore it, too, but it just sits there, dominating the room, until Stiles rolls over and punches it.</p>\n<p>Then he leans in and presses his face against the pillow, breathing in deep. It smells like Derek, faint and musky. </p>\n<p>Stiles lays there like that for a while, breathing in with his eyes closed, trying to push everything out of his head. He knows that when he wakes up in the morning, these last, terrible remnants of the spell will be gone, and he\u2019ll laugh at himself for being a sentimental wreck over smelling Derek Hale on his pillow. He might even tell Scott, to make Scott feel better about his Allison problem. Apparently everyone can succumb to lovesick puppydom.</p>\n<p>Stiles heaves a sigh and rolls out of bed, pulling all the bedding off his bed and hauling it to the washing machine before he can change his mind about it. He can\u2019t roll around in Derek\u2019s scent like a creepy loser. He just can\u2019t. Tomorrow, everything will be better. These last dying whimpers of the spell will be just a memory, and Stiles can get on with his life.</p>\n<p>His dad raises an eyebrow when he passes him on the way back to the room. \u201cSuddenly into housekeeping?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cThere were Doritos crumbs in them. They kept <i>stabbing</i> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d his dad says. </p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about going back up to his room, but all that lies that way are uncomfortable memories and his own feelings, so he flops down on the couch. \u201cFind any leads on that girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first one\u2019s safe, at least. Her mother called in earlier tonight,\u201d his dad says. \u201cSays the girl came home after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Stiles practically yelps. He thinks again of Rookwood\u2019s face when she talked about her daughter\u2019s corpse, and feels a strange stab of guilt. The woman had been nuts, but she\u2019d obviously loved her daughter. And apparently her determination to get revenge herself after discovering her daughter\u2019s murder had made her cover it up. One less thing to worry about.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d his dad says, and then shakes his head. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, but there\u2019s nothing really we can do now. Girl\u2019s no longer a missing person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy ending,\u201d Stiles replies unenthusiastically. \u201cIn a way. Though that has to at least be a good mark for your station. Better than another unsolved murder, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways looking to the bright side, that\u2019s my boy,\u201d his dad says, giving him a light punch on the arm. </p>\n<p>Stiles grins at his dad. \u201cHey, us Stilinskis gotta stick together.\u201d He pauses for effect. \u201cNo matter how much I sometimes think you secretly wanted a Boy Named Sue situation to happen between us. No other explanation for that name you saddled me with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSon, this world is rough,\u201d his dad says, straight-faced, \u201cand if a man\u2019s gonna make it, he\u2019s gotta be tough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes, grinning, and snags the remote control out of his dad\u2019s hand. \u201cHow\u2019s that for gravel in my gut?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad laughs. Stiles flips through the channels, ending up on one of the endless reruns of a reality show about terrible jobs, and they sit in comfortable silence, watching truckers risk an icy death in order to get supplies to isolated towns. </p>\n<p>After a while, his dad clears his throat and says, \u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his serious face. Stiles hastily gulps down the mouthful of corn chips he\u2019d just shoved in his mouth and says in an equally serious voice, \u201cDad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026\u201d His dad runs a hand through his short hair. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I\u2026 what? Yes?\u201d Stiles replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, you\u2019ve been a little\u2026 off\u2026 these past few days,\u201d his dad continues. \u201cAnd\u2026 Is it a girl? You know you can talk to me about anything. Did that Lydia girl hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia? No,\u201d Stiles says, before realizing that he\u2019s totally admitting that he has problems with <i>someone</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d his dad asks, looking interested.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles says, hiding his face in his hands. \u201cWhy does everyone just look at me and automatically know everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause your face is basically a giant billboard advertising your thoughts,\u201d his dad says immediately. \u201cAlways has been. Your mom and me always knew the second you\u2019d done something wrong, just by the look on your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>His expression saddens, the way it always does when Stiles\u2019 mom comes up, and Stiles leans over and rests his head on his dad\u2019s shoulder in a way he hasn\u2019t in a while. It\u2019s strangely comforting, pretending to be a kid again, and has the added bonus of him not having to see his dad\u2019s expression when he talks. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Just\u2026 how do you know when you really feel something for someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not something you can really define,\u201d his dad says slowly. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a switch that\u2019s thrown in your head, and suddenly, you have real feelings. It\u2019s something that builds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it is sudden?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cLike\u2026 what if you\u2019ve known someone for a while, and you definitely had no romantic feelings for them. More fear than anything, really,\u201d he adds thoughtfully. \u201cAnd then\u2026 it\u2019s suddenly different? Do you trust that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d his dad says. \u201cDo you trust <i>them</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. He trusts Derek with his life. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd most importantly,\u201d his dad continues, \u201cdo you trust yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really the only way to be sure of your feelings,\u201d his dad says. \u201cIt\u2019s to put enough trust in what you\u2019re feeling, and your interpretation of those feelings, to see if it\u2019s something you want to act on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a teenager,\u201d his dad says wisely. \u201cThough, just putting it out there\u2026 It doesn\u2019t really matter how old you are. Knowing if what you feel is real\u2026 that\u2019s a tough one for us all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Stiles asks quietly. \u201cWith Mom?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad is quiet for a long minute. Stiles wants to backtrack, make some joke and give him an out. The wound from his mother\u2019s death is still too raw.</p>\n<p>\u201cI woke up one morning,\u201d his dad says quietly, \u201cand she was the first thing I thought about. It wasn\u2019t anything special, we didn\u2019t have a date that day or anything. I just woke up thinking about how much she would like it if I brought her a cinnamon roll before she had to get to her nine o\u2019clock class. And that was it. I just\u2026 knew that she was the one.\u201d</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t the answer Stiles was expecting. \u201cYou just knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just knew.\u201d His dad nods. They sit quietly for a few minutes, then he says, \u201cSo you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not Lydia? I can see why she\u2019d scare you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s definitely not Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if you figure it out,\u201d his dad says after a beat, \u201cbe sure to bring him over for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Stiles says. He tries to picture Derek at the dinner table with him and his dad, and strangely, it doesn\u2019t feel that bizarre. Like it\u2019s something that could actually happen.</p>\n<p>They watch the rest of the episode in comfortable silence.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After his bedding finally finishes its go-around in the dryer, Stiles bids his dad goodnight and goes back to his room. He makes the bed, punching the pillows a few good times to eliminate any remaining soppy feelings he might have about <i>face indentions</i>, and goes about his nightly routine quickly, hoping that he\u2019s exhausted enough to fall into a dreamless sleep.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>Adrenaline must still be pumping through his veins, because once Stiles lays down, he just stares up at the ceiling. After a few minutes of trying to distract himself every time he thought about Derek, he grabs his phone and checks his messages.</p>\n<p>Nothing from Derek. He considers sending a <i>good nite!</i> but halfway through pecking it out, decides it\u2019s a terrible, needy idea and discards the text. He wonders if Isaac and Boyd are okay, but when he checks the time it\u2019s almost two am, and he doesn\u2019t want Derek to think he\u2019s laying awake thinking about his pack. Even though that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Instead he checks in with Scott, who replies saying that Allison is okay and that they\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow at school.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and buries his head under his pillow. Maybe if he just hides for long enough, he\u2019ll forget who Derek Hale is. That would solve most of his problems.</p>\n<p>Because the more he thinks about it, now that he\u2019s alone, there\u2019s no way that the\u2026 relationship\u2026 that he\u2019d thought at the time might be developing really <i>had</i>. Even if Stiles pretended like the magic had no effect on their respective feelings, Derek had been a wreck. First he\u2019d had control over his <i>body</i> taken away from him \u2013 and for a shapeshifter, Stiles was pretty sure that control was the absolute most important thing to have over yourself \u2013 and then he\u2019d killed a girl, when he was trying his hardest to be a different kind of Alpha from Peter. </p>\n<p>And then, the whole making out thing. When Stiles pieces together the timeline in his head, that had happened right around the time that Boyd had been taken over by the witches. And if bringing wolves into the fold intensified an Alpha\u2019s power, it had to mean that removing one destabilized it.</p>\n<p>None of it had been real. Stiles has to admit that to himself. Derek was\u2026 <i>Derek</i>, and there was no way that out of everyone in the world, he\u2019d chose Stiles. </p>\n<p>It was just\u2026 impossible.</p>\n<p>Stils stares into the darkness of the room, feeling adrift and alone. The warm, clenchy feeling that thinking of Derek had been giving him slowly transformed into something terrible and painful. It was like\u2026 like he\u2019d never be the same again. He\u2019d never just be Stiles again, because there was this gaping hole inside him, where he\u2019d been used by the magic and circumstance. </p>\n<p>Derek had been right. They hadn\u2019t actually been developing feelings for each other, and as the spell\u2019s effect faded to nothingness, Stiles was left empty and alone.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sleep claims him, and his dreams are uncomfortable and dark.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up groping at the other side of the bed, like he\u2019s trying to find something that\u2019s missing.</p>\n<p>He blearily stares at the sheets as if an answer will come to him, and then realizes that his alarm clock is what woke up him. \u201cOh, crap!\u201d he yelps when he sees what time it is. </p>\n<p>He trips across the hall to the shower, hops in and out as quickly as humanly possible, and dries off and dresses in the first assortment of clothes that he jerks out of his closet. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when he slides into the Jeep that he\u2019s clear-headed enough to remember the previous night\u2019s misadventure. He tries to laugh at how melodramatic he\u2019d been laying in bed, but mostly just decides to make Scott an apology heartbreak mixtape, because if Scott had felt anything like that when he had troubles with Allison, then Stiles is a douche for making fun of him.</p>\n<p>He pulls up at school and takes a deep breath. He can do this.</p>\n<p>He heads inside, but someone is suddenly beside him, grabbing his arm and tugging him away from the entrance of the school. He\u2019s not even sure why he\u2019s surprised that it\u2019s Erica, given the aggressive way she waylaid him.</p>\n<p>He stumbles along after her as she keeps a vice grip on his wrist until they reach a secluded nook to the side of the school that is normally used by smokers. Erica puts her hands on her hips and says, \u201cOkay, what the hell did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing so far today?\u201d Stiles answers uncertainly. </p>\n<p>Erica whacks him lightly upside the head. </p>\n<p>\u201cDammit, woman,\u201d Stiles yelps. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Alpha is moping,\u201d she says, eyes flashing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Alpha exists in a constant state of mope,\u201d Stiles tells her tersely. Derek is the last thing he wants to talk about right now. Derek\u2019s well-being is absolutely not any of Stiles\u2019 concern, and if the thought of him moping makes Stiles want to mope, well. That\u2019s what friends are for. Sympathetic moping.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are <i>morons</i>,\u201d Erica says, waving her arms around crazily. Stiles is pretty fascinated; the contrast between Erica\u2019s hot-girl makeover and her flailing body language is pretty fantastic. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek is fine,\u201d Stiles says reassuringly. \u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot worse than a little bitty spell hangover.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica gives him the ole crazy-eye. \u201cYes. Because that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, look at me! Totally bounced back from all the stupid magic-induced things that shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d He bounces a few times to prove exactly how bounced-back he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I thought talking to <i>Derek</i> was like having a conversation with a brick wall,\u201d Erica sighs. \u201cYou deserve each other.\u201d She shoves a piece of paper at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Stiles asks. He turns it over.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s excuse for yesterday. Derek said you didn\u2019t need an unexcused absence,\u201d Erica says. \u201cI had a whole stash of them from before. I just scribbled your name in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cThat\u2019s very\u2026. thoughtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Erica says. \u201cAlmost like someone cares or something, right? But nope. Just a magic spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns to walk away, and Stiles calls, \u201cAre Isaac and Boyd okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>She half-turns and says, \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 recovering. But yeah. I think they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles says. He stares at the note in his hands. \u201cUm. Thanks. And tell Derek\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a wolf, not an owl,\u201d Erica interrupts. \u201cTell him your own damn self.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>By the time Stiles actually gets inside the building, he feels like he\u2019s been through the ringer. He gets a few blissful moments of normalcy getting his absence dealt with, and then heads to his locker with whole minutes to spare before his first class.</p>\n<p>Then Scott and Allison surround him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says casually, like they didn\u2019t kidnap a man and kill a lady the night before. He\u2019s getting good at that. \u201cWhat\u2019s shaking? Wait, aren\u2019t you two supposed to be all\u2026 not together at school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Allison says. \u201cI earned myself some credit last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour family was happy with your shiny new death count?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery,\u201d Allison says. \u201cTurns out that Rookwood had tricked her coven into killing a hunter a few years ago. She\u2019s been on the hit list ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have like, a serial killer wall?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cAll the people the hunters want dead? Because if it earns us brownie points, we could start to assassinate bad guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could be love vigilantes!\u201d Stiles says enthusiastically. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird or creepy or morally dubious at all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of which\u2026\u201d Allison says slyly. \u201cHow did things work out with Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles bursts out. \u201cDoes no one care about anything but Derek? What happened to the good ole days when Derek was a complete non-entity in our lives?\u201d</p>\n<p>He got two identical, smarmy grins in reply. Stiles hates everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHate,\u201d he says, pointing to each of them. \u201cHate, hate, hate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison pinches his cheek, and Stiles flips her off before marching off to class.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jackson says as he passes him on the way to his seat. \u201cDid\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is everyone such an asshole?\u201d Stiles interrupts with, and grumpily sits down at his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause <i>I\u2019m</i> being the asshole here,\u201d Jackson mutters. \u201cI was just trying to see if my totally dangerous spying expedition did in fact save your asses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, the info was useful,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cGood job.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he stares crankily at the blackboard. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d he hears Jackson say, and that\u2019s just where Stiles is in his life right now. He\u2019s at the point where he\u2019s considered a dickbag by <i>Jackson Whittemore</i>. He sighs and sinks lower in his chair.</p>\n<p>He shares his next class with Scott, and when he slides down next to him, Scott looks at him seriously. \u201cListen\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf this has anything to do with Derek\u2026\u201d Stiles begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to high five you,\u201d Scott admits. \u201cYou popped your cherry! Finally! I thought you said you were going to have a parade when that happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls. \u201cSee, everyone keeps making assumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Derek definitely did it,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThe nose, it does not lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nose wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Stiles says, trying and failing to not sound epically grumpy. \u201cI remain untouched. Pure as the driven snow. Technically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m asking for details, because I want to be able to look Derek in the eye,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI mean, if he\u2019s doing his dickish Alpha thing and I\u2019m trying to defy him, I don\u2019t want to be thinking about the dirty things he\u2019s done to my best friend. But\u2026 you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I have a pretty good handle on who has and hasn\u2019t touched my dick,\u201d Stiles points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I think you\u2019re deliberately focusing on technicalities because you don\u2019t want to deal with the fact that you want Derek,\u201d Scott replies smugly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI regret ever watching daytime TV with you,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cI\u2019m just saying there\u2019s no cause for a parade.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolls his eyes. \u201cI think you\u2019re both being ridiculous. I mean, if it\u2019d been the spell, you wouldn\u2019t still be all gooey over him today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just lied,\u201d Scott says. \u201cA fact I didn\u2019t even need my keen senses to tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are so wrong. You are like a monument built to wrongness,\u201d Stiles grumbles.</p>\n<p>Scott leans out of his desk to pull Stiles in for a quick hug, and Stiles appreciates it, even though it\u2019s awkward as hell with the arm of the desk between them. The hug actually makes him feel a little better.</p>\n<p>Then he wonders if anyone\u2019s given Derek the hug he so desperately needs, and ugh, Stiles can\u2019t even stand listening to his own internal monologue anymore, if it\u2019s always going to veer back to Derek and his pout and how someone needs to be near him to tease him out of grimness.</p>\n<p>Then Coach Finstock realizes that they\u2019re not paying the slightest bit of attention to their worksheets and sends Scott to an empty seat across the room. Stiles actually kind of enjoys sitting by himself and focusing his attention \u2013 as much as possible -- on his work. And on the way his pen clicks. And on re-tying his shoe when he notices that the laces are uneven.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s startlingly, wonderfully mundane, and Stiles begins to think that maybe he can do this. He can forget about Derek and everything will be fine. For fuck\u2019s sake, he\u2019s fought monsters! Forgetting a few twisty feelings in his gut should be no big deal.</p>\n<p>So he goes through the rest of his classes pretending like everything\u2019s okay. And if he pretends hard enough, it kind of <i>is</i> okay. After all, the spell hasn\u2019t even been gone twenty-four hours. And he\u2019s still got the marks on his arm, so that all could rationally explain why he\u2019s feeling like he is.</p>\n<p>He somehow convinces Scott and Allison to drop the whole Derek thing. Maybe he does it by sticking his fingers in his ears and saying, \u201cLa la la la,\u201d when they bring him up, but whatever. It\u2019s successful.</p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t any monsters to battle, and he\u2019s pretty sure that Scott and Allison want rid of him so they can hook up after school while Allison is still in her family\u2019s good graces and can weasel away from them for a few hours. So Stiles drives around aimlessly for a bit, and then ends up at home, doing the pile of schoolwork that got shoved to the side over the course of the last few days\u2019 misadventures.</p>\n<p>He spends the night in a restless sleep, and when he wakes up in the morning, he almost feels like Stiles again.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t quite remember his dreams, though he has the uncomfortable feeling who they were about.</p>\n<p>He dresses for the day, touching the marks on his arm lightly before pulling on a long-sleeved plaid shirt. They\u2019re no longer even tender, and the scab is flaking at the edges, and Stiles thinks \u2013 maybe. Maybe when this goes away, things will be completely normal.</p>\n<p>The first thing Stiles sees when he walks up to his locker is werewolves.</p>\n<p>Isaac is lounging against the bank of lockers like he thinks he\u2019s Sid Vicious, and Boyd is standing a few feet away, arms crossed and looking vaguely uncomfortable. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, boy-wolves,\u201d Stiles says, debating whether he should sidle up between them like it\u2019s normal and get his Econ book, or if he should just stand here like it\u2019s a showdown. The warning bell rings and answers the question for him, and he squishes himself in between them to open his locker.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Boyd says.</p>\n<p>\u201cErica told us what you did,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cWith Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d Stiles yelps. Seriously, was <i>nothing</i> sacred? \u201cLies and falsifications!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo save us?\u201d Boyd asks, looking amused. \u201cShe seemed to think you played a key role.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Oh,\u201d Stiles says, cheeks reddening. \u201cI mostly stood there, to be honest. Allison\u2019s the one who really saved you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou kept our Alpha from being a witch puppet like we were,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was bad enough being taken over for a day,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cIf Derek had been\u2026 we\u2019d have been screwed. No escape for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd offers his fist to bump, and Stiles manages without looking too awkward. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>They leave him after that, both going their separate ways, and Stiles blinks a few times. He\u2019s never actually been thanked by werewolves before. Especially since his role in their rescue really had been a minimal one. It was kind of nice, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem better today,\u201d Scott says when Stiles slides in beside him in their first shared class of the day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a new lease on life,\u201d Stiles informs him. \u201cI am no longer under any hocus pocus. I\u2019m a free man, Scottie. A free bird, and I\u2019m gonna fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gives him a skeptical look, which Stiles pretends for their friendship\u2019s sake that he doesn\u2019t see. </p>\n<p>The rest of the morning goes smoothly, and mostly werewolf-free, which is nice. Stiles likes when things are nice. It\u2019s all very\u2026 nice.</p>\n<p>At lunch, he settles in at his usual table. Scott hasn\u2019t arrived yet \u2013 Stiles is pretty sure that he\u2019s found someplace out of the range of the cameras to meet up with Allison, and Stiles isn\u2019t even hating on that. He has a shiny new understanding about Scott\u2019s feelings and really, he\u2019s proud of him for finding a way around the Argents\u2019 collective crazy.</p>\n<p>Lydia settles her tray across from him and sits primly in the seat, straightening her silverware.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles offers, because it\u2019s still weird to him that Lydia would consider sitting down at a table that included him. He glances around. \u201cHaving a nice day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOther than the fact that everyone keeps me out of their adventures?\u201d Lydia says sweetly. \u201cStill?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, it wasn\u2019t an exciting adventure,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cOne tiny battle!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia pins him with a glare that has him squirming in his seat. \u201cThat is so not the point, Poindexter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it might help a little,\u201d Stiles mumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot really, no,\u201d Lydia says, and takes a bite of her lunch, tossing her hair. It\u2019s a move that always makes Stiles\u2019 heart go pitter-patter, but\u2026 today it does nothing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also been talking to her normally, with no unfortunate tongue-tangles.</p>\n<p>Stiles stares at Lydia like he\u2019s never seen her before. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia freezes, French fry halfway to her mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with you,\u201d Stiles says. It\u2019s a strange feeling; he\u2019s been in love with Lydia since he stopped thinking girls were icky. Pretty much Lydia is <i>why</i> he stopped thinking girls were icky. And now\u2026</p>\n<p>She\u2019s as gorgeous as ever, and Stiles still basically thinks she\u2019s perfect. But his heart isn\u2019t hammering like crazy and he\u2019s got full control of his mouth and hands, which normally both flail like they\u2019ve been possessed by a particularly awkward spirit whenever she\u2019s around.</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure that he could hold a full conversation with Lydia now and only embarrass himself in the normal ways. </p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to bake you a cake?\u201d Lydia asks, managing to look both disdainful and vaguely concerned at the same time.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and thumps his head down on the cafeteria table. \u201cNo. It just means that I should probably re-evaluate some emotions, but I don\u2019t wanna.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery mature of you,\u201d Lydia tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know how troubling this is,\u201d Stiles says, even though he doesn\u2019t actually feel all that troubled. Mostly, he just feels disappointed, because having a crush on Lydia has been the one constant in his life and now\u2026</p>\n<p>Now that\u2019s been replaced by something far scarier.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The dreams get worse.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>By Friday, Stiles feels as though he\u2019s really gotten a handle on this whole pretending-everything\u2019s-fine deal. He\u2019s no longer being a douchebag to people. He\u2019s calmly going about his day and not checking his phone to see if Derek has miraculously broken the silence treaty. He\u2019s basically a functional human being.</p>\n<p>Mostly, anyhow.</p>\n<p>He manages the whole day at school without Scott or Allison or anyone saying the name Derek to him, though granted, that\u2019s mostly accomplished by Stiles turning on his heel and suddenly remembering he needs something from his locker every time someone begins to say a word that starts with a D. Turns out there are a lot more D-words than Stiles would have figured made their way into everyday conversation.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not entirely surprised, though, when Scott declares that they need to have a boy\u2019s night and drags him to his Jeep after school.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <i>that</i> bad off,\u201d Stiles lies valiantly, and wrenches open the door to his Jeep before realizing that Erica is already lounging in the driver\u2019s seat, tapping her fingernails on the wheel.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, out,\u201d Stiles tells her firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in, loser,\u201d she says, beaming at him, because ugh, of course Erica is <i>that</i> girl.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wish you were a Regina,\u201d Stiles mutters, but just goes with it anyhow because Scott shoves him into the back, and unfortunately, Scott has werewolf strength and Stiles does not.</p>\n<p>Erica and Scott argue over the radio on the entire drive, which means that Stiles can sit in the backseat and glare daggers at the backs of their stupid heads. And then he realizes where they\u2019re at.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles protests. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Erica says, \u201cMe and Scott had a discussion, and we decided that you two are too dumb to manage something like this on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cManage what?\u201d Stiles says, horrible suspicion dawning about their intentions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some sort of bizarre set-up, is it? Oh god. You\u2019ve been watching sitcom reruns, haven\u2019t you? Please don\u2019t lock me in a closet with a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two just need to talk,\u201d Erica says. \u201cSeriously. This avoiding each other crap can\u2019t work forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure it can,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cPretty sure that\u2019s how most people handle things. Avoiding it forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky for you, I\u2019m too good of a friend to let that happen,\u201d Scott says, and when Stiles refuses to leave the Jeep, physically pulls him out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis is\u2026this is kidnapping! I know the law, and this is definitely taking me without my consent\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and go inside,\u201d Erica says, prodding him with the pointy toe of her shoe. \u201cScoot your boots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not okay,\u201d Stiles tells them sternly as he enters Derek\u2019s warehouse.</p>\n<p>Apparently Derek has his super-hearing turned off or something, because he looks startled when he comes out of the train and sees Stiles standing awkwardly in the doorway, struggling against Erica and Scott\u2019s stupid, stupid werewolf strength.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d Derek asks, looking at all three of them like they\u2019re the most annoying intruders in the history of mankind.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, buddy!\u201d Scott says brightly. \u201cWe thought that hey, we were in the neighborhood, maybe we should have a visit. Just some pack buddies. Visiting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d Stiles hisses to him as he watches Derek\u2019s face carefully. Somehow he kind of forgot the presence that Derek has, because in his mind he kind of faded to this big jumble of <i>feelings</i> and now he\u2019s standing there with this befuddled expression on his stupidly perfect face and Stiles hates everyone for putting him in this room. He was doing so good and now the stupid swoopy pit of feelings is back.</p>\n<p>He stares hard at his shoes, because then he can\u2019t see Derek\u2019s face. The look of befuddlement had faded into something that Stiles couldn\u2019t put a name to, but he was pretty sure that it wasn\u2019t good. Disappointment, maybe. </p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t want Derek to be disappointed by his arrival. Stiles is pretty sure that\u2019s the worst reaction imaginable.</p>\n<p>So he stares at the dirty laces of his sneakers and wonders if he should maybe wash them at some point, or if they just give his shoes character, and Derek doesn\u2019t say anything at all.</p>\n<p>Erica pushes Stiles\u2019 shoulder and he takes a step forward, but still keeps his eyes firmly on his shoes. And the dirt on the floor. And the pattern that he makes when he scuffs his shoe against the dirt on the floor. It\u2019s all very fascinating.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Erica sighs. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek says at the same time Stiles spits out an, \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if we give them some privacy?\u201d Scott asks Erica in a loud whisper. </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says skeptically. \u201cYou two. Talk it out. We\u2019re not saying you have to kiss and make up, but you\u2019re being dumb and just\u2026\u201d She waves a hand around. \u201c<i>Talk</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Scott and Erica step outside, leaving Stiles alone with Derek, the traitors.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries his hardest to pretend like still staring at his shoes is a valid social move, but even he can\u2019t convince himself of that. So he looks up, and Derek\u2026 </p>\n<p>Derek is staring at his shoes, hands shoved deep into his pockets.</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t help it. He snorts.</p>\n<p>Derek jerks his head up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s a really interesting floor, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Stiles offers, waving his hand around.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek replies. He stares at Stiles, like he hasn\u2019t seen him in years. </p>\n<p>Stiles scuffs his foot along the floor again, drawing a frowny face. \u201cI\u2026 How have you been?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, just peachy,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cDoing my thang, you know how it goes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks as though he does not, in fact, know how it goes. Derek kind of looks like he\u2019s about to bolt. Stiles isn\u2019t sure why. The only weird thing happening is the fact that Stiles is here, and\u2026</p>\n<p>Does Derek hate him that much? He knows things got weird and awkward and Stiles left in a hurry after the witch died and all, but\u2026 Surely Derek\u2019s not mad at him. Stiles takes a deep breath. \u201cSo um. The spell\u2019s gone! That\u2019s awesome. I mean, that\u2019s what we wanted, and it\u2019s awesome. That it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Derek says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd um,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI think we\u2019re cool? We\u2019re cool, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer. He just stands there looking at Stiles like that\u2019s an acceptable thing to do. Stiles realizes abruptly that he\u2019s kind of freaking out. He takes a deep breath, but that just reminds him that his stomach feels like it\u2019s got an army of butterflies doing some sort of particularly aggressive flying formations in there.</p>\n<p>Stiles has to say something. Derek is just standing there looking like his world is crashing down around him. \u201cI\u2026 That is to say, I don\u2019t think that\u2026 the spell is happening anymore. And I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles kind of wishes he could just punch himself in the face, because that would be smoother than what is coming out of his mouth. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like being your friend,\u201d Stiles says. He immediately wants the floor to swallow him whole, because did he just say that? Did he just tell Derek Hale, who he has been having increasingly hot dreams about over the past few nights, who gives him the kind of fluttery, breathless feelings that he thought up until this point were just shit that people made up, who, most importantly, he spent several days figuring out was one hell of an awesome dude and that Stiles really, really wants him in his life\u2026</p>\n<p>Did he just tell him they were friends?</p>\n<p>He kind of wants to hit his head against a concrete column, especially when Derek gets this kicked puppy look and says, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>He awkwardly tries to remember what normal humans did with their hands and feet and mouths when they were standing there with their heart feeling like it\u2019d just been smashed with a hammer with no one to blame but themselves. Stiles is a moron. He\u2019s a moron and he can\u2019t figure out how his mouth works and he thinks he could probably save this, if he just managed to say the right thing\u2026</p>\n<p>But nothing comes out.</p>\n<p>Then he hears the door slide open and Erica saying loudly, \u201cJesus Christ, we\u2019ve got to fix this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErica, we said we\u2019d give them a whole ten minutes\u2026\u201d Scott hisses, chasing after her, and then suddenly Erica is standing right between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt clearly wasn\u2019t just the spell, you know,\u201d she says firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Derek\u2019s voice brooks no argument.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Erica asks, voice saccharine.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Scott says, grabbing her arm, but she wrenches it away, and then suddenly she\u2019s sashaying towards Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles stands there, dumbfounded, as Erica wraps her arms loosely around his neck, looks back at Derek with pouty lips and says, \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then she\u2019s kissing Stiles.</p>\n<p>He flails his arms. Erica feels nice pressed up against him \u2013 really nice, if he\u2019s completely honest \u2013 but there\u2019s something wrong about it. Her lips are soft, and she\u2019s really going at it, kissing him aggressively in a way that is actually kind of hot\u2026</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not Derek.</p>\n<p>He realizes that he can in fact pull back, but as he\u2019s pulling back, so is Erica. Rather, Erica is being <i>pulled</i> back by Derek, who looks as though he\u2019s just been punched in the face. Repeatedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was mean,\u201d Scott says from his vantage point of <i>not in the middle of this mess</i>. Stiles hates him just a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell, Erica?\u201d Derek glowers at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care, do you?\u201d Erica sing-songs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...\u201d Derek looks around, like he\u2019ll find the words he\u2019s looking for if he just searches hard enough.</p>\n<p>And Stiles realizes that punched-in-the-face expression was because he saw Stiles being kissed by someone else. Someone who wasn\u2019t Derek.</p>\n<p>Which means Derek <i>likes</i> him. He likes Stiles, and it has nothing to do with the spell at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re such a goober,\u201d Stiles crows. \u201cA great big jealous goober!\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever Derek was expecting, it obviously wasn\u2019t this. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou!\u201d Stiles says, pointing. He can see Scott shaking his head frantically behind Derek, trying to get Stiles to take a different approach, but Stiles can\u2019t stop himself. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone else to kiss me! You like me! I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>His words are suddenly lost in Derek\u2019s mouth, as Derek grabs hold of his shirt front, shoves him against one of the concrete pillars, and kisses him like there\u2019s no tomorrow. </p>\n<p>Stiles settles his hands on Derek\u2019s hips, feeling the roughness of his jeans under Stiles\u2019 fingertips, and underneath that, the heat of Derek\u2019s hard-muscled hips. He presses up into the kiss, grateful for the concrete pillar supporting him as his knees go weak. Derek\u2019s kiss is even more aggressive than Erica\u2019s, like he\u2019s marking his territory with every press of his lips and sweep of his tongue. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s ridiculously hot, and it takes every ounce of Stiles\u2019 willpower to not grind himself up against Derek as he tightens his grip on Derek\u2019s hips. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when Derek mouths his way down Stiles\u2019 neck that Stiles remembers that Erica and Scott are in the room. He opens his eyes to see Erica grinning at him and giving him a thumbs up while Scott is edging towards the door and looking extremely uncomfortable. Maybe Stiles isn\u2019t doing as good a job as he thinks at not grinding his hips up against Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to suggest\u2026who the hell knows what, that they go hang out in another room for a bit, since he\u2019s definitely not asking Derek to stop anytime soon, but what comes out is a breathy little moan as Derek sucks on the skin just below his ear. </p>\n<p>Scott lets out a strangled noise of his own, which is when Derek apparently remembers they\u2019re not alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you give us a minute?\u201d he asks after he pulls away from Stiles\u2019 neck, his voice gone hoarse. Stiles clutches at his hips; he\u2019s not letting go anytime soon. There are some things Scott definitely doesn\u2019t need to see, Stiles thinks. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Erica says, sauntering over to Scott, who is scrambling towards the door. \u201cHoller if you need us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles decides that it\u2019s worth letting go of Derek for long enough to flip her off.</p>\n<p>When the door clangs shut behind them, Stiles expects Derek to resume the making out, but instead Derek leans in and takes in a deep breath through his nose. He finally releases his grip on Stiles\u2019 shirt, which is now crumpled from where Derek has twisted the fabric, and runs his hands down Stiles\u2019 side as he presses his nose into the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re right,\u201d he says, sounding startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s right about what?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy pack,\u201d Derek clarifies. \u201cThey said you carry my scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is never trusting another werewolf apology ever again. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, voice gone low. \u201cNever apologize about that.\u201d He takes another deep breath, obviously taking in the scent. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles says. He leans in to kiss Derek, because that\u2019s something he can do now. This kiss is softer, more searching. Stiles thinks he could probably kiss Derek like this for the rest of his life and die happy.</p>\n<p>And then Derek pulls back, looking at Stiles with eyes that are just a little too bright. \u201cWhat I said before\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were a lot of befores,\u201d Stiles says, when it\u2019s obvious Derek has trailed off and isn\u2019t sure how to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage of you,\u201d Derek says quietly, reaching out and tracing the lines of the claw marks on Stiles\u2019 arm through his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to <i>hurt</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cOkay. This is hard, but I\u2019m just going to come out and say it, and\u2026 yeah. I\u2019m saying it. I really, really like you. And you\u2019ve become really important to me. And it wasn\u2019t just some fucking curse or werewolf bullshit that did it. It was <i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks as though he can\u2019t believe what Stiles is saying. Like\u2026 like it doesn\u2019t make sense that Stiles could feel that way. He takes a deep breath, and says, \u201cI tried really hard to believe that this whole thing was just\u2026 magic. Something out of my control, something that you couldn\u2019t possibly feel too.\u201d He reaches out and takes Stiles\u2019 hand, stroking Stiles\u2019 knuckles with his thumb as he talks. He has an intense, bright look on his face that sends tingles through Stiles\u2019 entire body. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair of me to blame what I was feeling on everything else, just because I was scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls their joined hands up between them, and presses a kiss on them and grins. \u201cI think we\u2019re both morons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Derek agrees, grinning back at him. The sight is rare enough, even after all their time together, that Stiles just stands there goofily smiling back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this is real,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Stiles understands now why Scott always has such goofy grins on his face. He\u2019s having to fight really hard to keep his face away from The Joker territory. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019ve been super miserable these past few days, not being with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy pack defied me and dragged you to me,\u201d Derek says dryly. \u201cIf that says anything about the kind of mood I\u2019ve been in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Cranky Pants, huh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou know, you can just take them off\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles then jumps like fourteen feet as Isaac yells, \u201cSeriously, dudes, we all have super hearing here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down, biting his lip like he\u2019s holding in a big grin. Stiles bangs his head back against the pillar and sighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a low rumble on the word talk that clearly means a lot more than that, and Stiles practically trips over his own feet stumbling after him. </p>\n<p>Derek leads them to his Camaro, and Stiles hops in without a second thought. He figures Scott can probably be trusted to take the Jeep home. </p>\n<p>Erica and Scott are hanging out near the door. Stiles totally hates how smug their expressions are, but not enough to interrupt his Derek-time to yell at them.</p>\n<p>He pretends he can\u2019t hear them calling, \u201cToodles!\u201d and \u201cBe safe!\u201d as he and Derek drive off.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They end up parked out by the woods.</p>\n<p>The sun has just set, and Derek of course knows every private spot the woods have to offer. Stiles fidgets with the buttons on the dash because, seriously, after his Jeep, Derek\u2019s car is like the freaking Batmobile, and Stiles has certain fantasies he kind of wants to enact.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 you weren\u2019t just feeling the effects of the spell,\u201d Derek says hesitantly after a few minutes of Stiles going to town on his stereo.</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cmostly proven by the fact that I freaking pined for you once we were apart and the spell was broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rubs a hand on the back of his neck, like he\u2019s bashful or something, which is so monumentally dumb that Stiles has to call him out on it. \u201cDude, don\u2019t even pretend like you don\u2019t know how much I want you. You\u2019ve got a supernatural sniffer and I know you know how to use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was\u2026 I was hoping that it was the connection. If not the spell, then\u2026\u201d Derek reaches out and touches Stiles\u2019 arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoping?\u201d That has to be the wrong word. Stiles feels his stomach plummet like he\u2019s in a free fall. He\u2019s kind of put himself all out there and Derek was hoping it wasn\u2019t true.</p>\n<p>Derek looks at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been good with relationships. You should know that. You know all about the Kate thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was like a million years ago though,\u201d Stiles says, even though he knows perfectly well that your heart holds onto things longer than it should. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAnd since then I\u2019ve mostly avoided\u2026 entanglements\u2026 with people who know what I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the bleakest thing he\u2019s heard Derek say. Stiles tries to keep his face steady, but he knows Derek can tell what he\u2019s feeling. \u201cDerek. That\u2019s just\u2026 You can\u2019t be with someone who doesn\u2019t know who you are. And I know who you are, and I\u2019m fine with it. More than fine, really. I think you\u2019re great. Super. Marrrvelous.\u201d He rolls the r\u2019s just to make Derek smile.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a shy smile, like he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s allowed to or not. Stiles brushes his hand on Derek\u2019s cheek, amazed because that\u2019s something he can <i>do</i> now, and Derek tilts his head along with it, like a puppy getting his scruff rubbed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with who you are, too,\u201d Derek says, still with that smile, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then something occurs to him, and he doesn\u2019t want to break this quiet happiness between them, but\u2026</p>\n<p>He pulls off the long-sleeved over shirt he\u2019s wearing. The claw marks are still visible, for all that they\u2019re mostly healed. \u201cAbout this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek traces them gently with his thumb, and Stiles shivers. \u201cI think I know why this did what it did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <i>did</i> it do?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but there\u2019s a tiny, dark part of him that\u2019s insisting that all of this is too good to be true and that somehow, some way, it all goes back to these marks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I clawed Jackson,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles bites his lip to keep from trying to ask him to stick to relevant topics, \u201cI was intimidating him. And that connection manifested badly, with Jackson getting the worst parts of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seemed pretty freaked,\u201d Stiles agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut when I reached out for you\u2026\u201d Derek cuts his eyes up at Stiles, and looks at him in a way no one\u2019s ever looked at Stiles before. It\u2019s like he\u2019s the only person on earth with the power to save Derek, and it gives him a strange pang in his chest. \u201cAll I could think was that I had to hold on to you. That if I just didn\u2019t let go\u2026 if I didn\u2019t let go, then I could protect you, somehow. That you were the most important thing right then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a shaky laugh. \u201cThere were more important things\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI wanted to save you, and thought that you could save me. And you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll I did was kick some dirt around,\u201d Stiles mutters. He can\u2019t look away from Derek, from the brightness of his eyes, and the pang in his chest feels like it\u2019s expanding, taking him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <i>saved</i> me,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou keep saving me, and you\u2019re just\u2026 you\u2019re just human, but you throw yourself out there anyway, and I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re underselling yourself a bit here,\u201d Stiles manages. He\u2019s leaning forward, and Derek reaches out and rests his hand on the back of Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cBut what does this have to do with\u2026\u201d he waves his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIntent,\u201d Derek says. \u201cMy intent wasn\u2019t to bind us together, but somehow the spell the witch cast twisted it into that. My intention was to keep you safe, and that\u2019s what this did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy\u2026\u201d Stiles trails off. Derek is so close, with this look like he\u2019s baring his soul.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy letting you in,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cI think\u2026 you\u2019ve seemed to understand me. I know I don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m not the best at communicating, but you\u2019ve <i>understood</i> me anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it just\u2026 gave me insight into you,\u201d Stiles says. It makes a weird kind of sense, the way that everything about Derek has been markedly less mysterious lately. \u201cExcept for how I was pretty sure I was the only one who was smitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek leans in, pressing his forehead against Stiles, and says quietly, \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Stiles shifts a little to get more comfortable, and he can feel Derek\u2019s breath on his lips. \u201cExample?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat first morning,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cWhen you were in my shower, moaning like you had no idea what you were doing to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was pretty sure that you wanted to kill me,\u201d Stiles says. The feeling in his chest has expanded and feels like it\u2019s filling up his entire body, and it\u2019s taking everything he has not to lean forward that final inch to kiss Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. He grins like a total asshole, and yeah, Stiles is going to kiss him. \u201cJust devour you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d Stiles manages to get out before pressing his mouth against Derek\u2019s. The car isn\u2019t designed for making out, especially with someone as bulky as Derek, but Stiles is one hundred percent willing to put in an effort anyway.</p>\n<p>Because Derek feels <i>amazing</i>, his hand threading through Stiles\u2019 hair, ruffling it up as much as possible, and his mouth, god, his mouth feels perfect. Stiles grabs onto the front of his leather jacket, the zipper biting into Stiles\u2019 palm, and pulls, wanting to feel as much of Derek as possible.</p>\n<p>When the kiss breaks off, Stiles manages to say, \u201cCan we have a no bad wolf puns during makeouts rule?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d Derek says. He\u2019s staring at Stiles\u2019 mouth, and Stiles self-consciously flicks his tongue out to wet his lips. That doesn\u2019t seem to help Derek any. \u201cDo you think you could really manage it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than you, buddy,\u201d Stiles says. He\u2019s still got a death grip on Derek\u2019s jacket, he realizes, and lets it loose reluctantly. The Camaro\u2019s bucket seats mean that even though Stiles is half-turned, the console is in the way, and Derek flicks his eyes to the backseat, pulling off his jacket.</p>\n<p>Stiles eyes it dubiously \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculously tiny \u2013 but somehow they fit. Somehow meaning that Stiles is wedged in underneath Derek, which\u2026 insofar as things go, it\u2019s a really nice place to be. Stiles is pretty sure it\u2019s the best place he\u2019s ever been, actually. And then Derek pulls of his shirt, too, and Stiles is free to <i>touch</i> him and\u2026 yeah. This is awesome.</p>\n<p>Derek seems determined to kiss Stiles until he can\u2019t <i>breathe</i>, and Stiles pretty much only wants to return the favor. His dick is pulsing, hard and ready, and Stiles is so turned on that he can\u2019t even <i>think</i>. He bucks up against Derek and can feel him straining uncomfortably hard against his own jeans.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Stiles manages, and reaches down and fumbles at the button on Derek\u2019s jeans. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than he would have guessed, especially with most of his brain focused on the way that Derek is pressing wet, hot kisses against the most sensitive part of his neck. When he finally gets the button undone, he lets out a little cheer, and Derek grins down at him.</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t entirely sure what he should do next, so he just plunges his hand into Derek\u2019s open jeans, into his underwear. He wraps his hand tightly around Derek\u2019s dick, and Derek groans, deep and low into Stiles\u2019 ear. He shifts a little, tugging his jeans and underwear down enough that his dick springs free.</p>\n<p>The angle is weird \u2013 different from when he gets himself off \u2013 but Derek chants low, murmuring encouragement to him as Stiles jerks him off. The backseat is tight, even with the front seats shoved forward, and Derek looms over him, bracing himself on one side while he pushes up against Stiles\u2019 hand eagerly.</p>\n<p>Derek stiffens, grunting as Stiles changes the pace up, and then comes with a groan, collapsing on top of Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles manages to pull his arm out from under Derek\u2019s body, and lets him enjoy the aftermath for a good five, six seconds before whining into his ear, \u201cOh god, you weigh a ton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek says lazily. Stiles wipes his hand off on Derek\u2019s back, just because.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst off, my turn, you big orgasm hog,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cand secondly, you are squishing me like a bug.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs and Stiles is forced to reach up and pull his hair, which\u2026 just makes Derek look at him with wide, blown pupils and give him a predatory grin. It\u2019s stupidly hot and the only thing keeping Stiles from rutting up against him like a bitch in heat is the fact that Derek is too fucking heavy to move.</p>\n<p>But then Derek pulls himself up, somehow positioning himself in the cramped space, and tugs Stiles\u2019 pants down over his hips. Then he lowers himself back down, bracing himself up with one hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cI just need\u2014\u201c Derek manages, and then he\u2019s mouthing wetly at Stiles\u2019 neck. He\u2019s pushing a hand down into Stiles\u2019 pants, wrapping it loosely around Stiles\u2019 dick. Then he squeezes, hand solid and tight around Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks wildly that he can\u2019t say that he\u2019s untouched anymore, and then Derek is jerking him off, slow and steady, occasionally dipping his hand down to cup Stiles\u2019 balls, and Stiles can\u2019t even begin to hold back the steady stream of <i>Oh god</i>s and desperate groans and <i>Derek, Derek</i>s.</p>\n<p>He comes embarrassingly quickly, letting out a stuttering moan. Derek wipes the come off on the sleeve of Stiles\u2019 abandoned overshirt, and then leans down to kiss Stiles again, bare skin pressing together where their pants are undone and Stiles\u2019 shirt has rucked up.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s a rapping on the window.</p>\n<p>Derek breaks the kiss abruptly, and Stiles stares in horror at his dad standing outside the car, looking just as shocked to see Stiles as Stiles is to see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, holy god,\u201d Stiles says, burying his face against Derek\u2019s chest, hoping that it\u2019s too dark for his dad to see much of what\u2019s going on. Slim hope, really, given that he\u2019s holding a freaking <i>flashlight.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cSir,\u201d Derek says. He looks like a deer in the headlights, which would be funny to Stiles at any other point in his life, but right now he\u2019s too busy quietly dying of mortification. His pants are still down below his hips, and Derek\u2019s half-naked, and yeah. He\u2019s pretty sure that his dad has a good idea of what just went down here. Especially given that Derek is still on top of him. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s never going to be able to look his dad in the eye again. Ever. The Stilinskis have officially entered the Anti-Eye Contact Era. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a no-parking zone.\u201d His dad\u2019s voice is slightly strangled. \u201cHello, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad,\u201d Stiles acknowledges. His voice sounds considerably more strangled than his dad\u2019s did. \u201cErm. Nice night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek makes a move to get off Stiles, but Stiles holds on tight to his arm as a reminder that no, that is not preferable when everyone\u2019s dicks are still out on display.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s night, yes,\u201d his dad says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t apply the word nice to it right now. Mr. Hale?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks a few times in the Sheriff\u2019s direction. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you call it a nice night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer,\u201d hisses Stiles. </p>\n<p>Derek takes a deep breath and says with considerably more pretense at calm than either Stilinski has managed thus far, \u201cIt was, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles moans, attempting his best to hide under Derek so that his dad can\u2019t see his face.</p>\n<p>When he peeks out, his dad is staring tactfully in the other direction and announces, \u201cDoes this have anything to do with our conversation the other night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA bit,\u201d Stiles admits. Derek pulls himself up enough to get his jeans in order, and Stiles is considerably more awkward getting his own business back under wraps.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your conclusion?\u201d His dad doesn\u2019t sound angry, at least. More\u2026 worried. Worried that Stiles hasn\u2019t figured out whether what he\u2019s feeling is real or not.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Stiles says quietly, staring at Derek. \u201cDefinitely real.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek runs a hand through his hair, looking oddly bashful, and grins at Stiles. \u201cMe, too,\u201d he murmurs, and willingly climbs out of the car to face the Sheriff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>THE END.</p>"
