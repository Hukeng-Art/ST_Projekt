  "text": "<p>By the time that Hawks is finally allowed to leave the Hero Public Safety Commission building, he\u2019s close to shaking with anxiety, frustration, and a slew of other emotions that he can\u2019t even begin to pick apart. His wings shake, and this time he can\u2019t stop them, can\u2019t even give the <em>illusion</em> of stillness by controlling his feathers. He can\u2019t feel through them anymore, and he almost feels blind without all of the sensations that he usually gets, even if it can all be a bit much. Despite not being able to feel everything through his feathers, every sensation grates up and down his spine painfully, even the small breath that his Handler lets out when she sees him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>know</em> that we don\u2019t like to do this to you, Hawks,\u201d she sighs, like she\u2019s disappointed that she has to say this. Like he takes her kindness for granted. He nods numbly at her, not saying anything and not looking her in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The look that he gets is full of mock-sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for a car,\u201d she offers, not even bothering to wait for his reply before her heels start clicking across the polished floor. Hawks isn\u2019t sure that he could give one right now, his voice still trapped somewhere in his chest, which feels too tight, so tight that he\u2019s surprised that he can even breathe because they had <em>grounded</em> him and birds are meant to fly-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The commission, displeased with his reliance on them, had taken his flight feathers, cut off the tips, and grounded him both literally and figuratively. He can\u2019t fly like he\u2019s meant to, like he <em>always</em> has. Instead, his wings are two useless, feathery lumps on his back, weighing him down as he blankly waits for a car to take him home for the first time since he\u2019d moved into his own place. His wings flap, as if insisting that they could hold him long enough, that he doesn\u2019t need a car to get home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks ignores them as he watches the commission\u2019s car pull up in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks can\u2019t do anything. His wings are a constant ache that can and will get worse, depending on what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walking jostles his wings too much, the hop that he\u2019d never fully been trained out of coming back to bite him in the ass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting involves chairs, which have backs that crush his wings to his back, a special kind of agony when his feather\u2019s <em>aren\u2019t</em> cut open and raw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he tries to sleep the blanket slides across his wings and it feels like he\u2019s grabbed a live wire. Out of a small sense of fear, he\u2019s kicked them to the floor and just tried to sleep on his stomach without them, but even then he couldn't.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trying his best to ignore it, to go about his day like he\u2019s supposed to, but Hawks is almost never home, and it shows; he doesn\u2019t have anything to hold his attention, no movies or puzzles or books. His apartment, aside from clothes and canned coffee, is depressingly empty of anything personal. There\u2019s just paperwork and a cream colored <em>everything</em> to keep him company, and he's slowly losing his mind. Having nothing to focus on makes him more aware of the burning itch of his wings, which makes him more and more desperate for something to distract himself.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Even if he wasn\u2019t in pain at every breeze, he still couldn\u2019t even go outside, because some villains just get the <em>irresistible</em> urge to start shit when they see a hero. You wouldn\u2019t think that it was a thing, but it is. The first time it happened Hawks had been trying to buy a fucking mango, just <em>one</em> mango, and he still remembers the feeling of absolute <em>disbelief</em> as someone, who sure as hell hadn\u2019t <em>looked</em> evil, met his eyes and exploded the self-checkout area next to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t gone back since, and it\u2019s the excuse he gives Rumi every time when she says he needs to eat fresh food. She always rolls her eyes, but given that she was the hero that showed up to the scene first, she can\u2019t deny it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So on the first day, he ignores the pain as best he can because he has to do <em>something</em>, he can\u2019t just idly sit there anymore. He paces, and cleans, and rearranges the same seven pieces of furniture before moving them all back to their original spots, ignoring the sharp pain that shoots up his spine every time his wings brush against something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the second day, he finally, at Rumi\u2019s suggestion, invests in a Netflix and a Disney Plus account. He also learns how to make one specific thing, eggs, and gets <em>great</em> at it, not stopping no matter how many disgruntled looks he gets from the grocery delivery woman when he orders carton after carton of eggs because the first batches weren't even really edible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the third day, he gets a Grindr account, which lasts ten minutes before he\u2019s frantically deleting it after someone asks for pictures of his feet. He listens to a podcast that answers every question he didn\u2019t know he had with research to back it up. He orders avocados and puts them on his face. He finds a small bottle of nail polish and paints his talons a cheery yellow that clashes horribly with his entire body somehow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the middle of shoving the sofa so that it\u2019s back faces the TV to make it more convenient for his wings, which still light up with pain every time he so much as shifts, avocado still smeared on his face, hair held back with a fuzzy headband, airpods connected to the movie in his ears, and eggs cooling on the kitchen counter, when Dabi shows up. At first, Hawks is so preoccupied with moving the couch, ignoring his cut feathers, and trying to keep watching \u2018Tangled\u2019 (who he now relates to so much, his Handler is kind of like the kid\u2019s mom) that he doesn\u2019t even notice he\u2019s not alone, much less that someone has broken into his apartment <em>again</em> (Dabi is a repeat offender, and at this point Hawks is considering just giving him the spare key that opens the balcony door). He\u2019s finally dragged the table against the back of the sofa, put his plate down, and is sitting with his wings spread out behind him when the screen is blocked and he startles so hard that he almost falls backwards off the couch. His wings scrape their cut tips against the couch, catching on the carpet, and he screams shrilly. He almost lands on his wings, but he catches himself at the last second. So he's there, gripping the couch like his life depends on it and blinking owlishly at the villain who\u2019s regarding him with so much amusement that he can feel himself turning red under the avocado smeared across his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Luckily, Dabi had taken his scream as one of surprise, not unimaginable pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi is gesturing for him to take an airpod out, and Hawks isn\u2019t sure how badly he wants to hear himself being laughed at, but he complies anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHawks, what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man in question slowly uses his hold on the back of the couch to pull himself back up, wincing as his wings drag behind him, before he answers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDay off?\u201d he tries, smiling brightly at the villain, who obviously doesn\u2019t believe him even a little bit. He looks a little irritated, and like he\u2019s considering the pros and cons of just setting the hero on fire, before he pauses and eyes the area behind Hawks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of your wings?\u201d he demands, like Hawks\u2019 feathers will just pop out if he asks about them like dogs that want attention. He\u2019s stepping around the couch to join the hero as Hawks tries to find a response that won\u2019t make him sound like a whiny kid. He fails, badly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m grounded,\u201d Hawks mutters, his wings shifting closer to him at the admission and almost making him hiss in pain. Dabi throws himself down next to him, sitting sideways so that he can stare at Hawks without hurting his delicate, villainous neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGrounded like <em>\u2018got in trouble\u2019</em> or grounded like <em>injured</em>?\u201d Dabi asks absently, his eyes catching on the clipped feathers as Hawks tries to hide them. The hero doesn\u2019t answer, instead trying to sneakily fold his wings to hide the worst of the damage. The villain's cold hand snaps out and grabs his wingtip before he can pull it away fully, pulling it closer to his face like he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing. \u201cWhat did you <em>do</em>?\u201d he asks incredulously, his fingers tracing over the cut edge of a flight feather. Hawks shrieks in pain before he can catch himself, his nails tearing holes in the fabric of the couch. Dabi immediately drops the wing, looking a little startled. Pretending like that didn\u2019t just happen, Hawks clears his throat but doesn\u2019t say anything. Dabi watches him warily from his spot on the couch, but he doesn't make a move to grab his wing again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily, the villain\u2019s phone chimes, demanding his attention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t care,\u201d Dabi mutters to Hawks, reading whatever message he just got. The villain shoves himself off of the couch and breezes past a very confused Hawks who's very grateful that he doesn't have to explain why he's a useless flightless bird at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi\u2019s gone before Hawks can even ask what\u2019s happening and be a good hero by doing his <em>job</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall, Hawks lasts three days before he walks into the bathroom, his hands shaking the slightest bit as his feathers scream with his movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The feathers on his back twitch, like they\u2019re trying to rip themselves free, and he flinches as he extends them and moves their tips closer to his face to stare at them dishearteningly. The damaged feathers are in his reach now, their cut ends seeming to catch the light, and they look awful. The usually uniform tips of the feathers have been cut short, making their tips look blocky. A shaky sigh leaves him before he steels himself, reaches for the nearest cut feather, and rips it out with a shout that he quickly muffles by biting into his balled up fist. Gods, it hurts like pulling <em>teeth</em>, but he has to do it, and he doesn't have the luxury of getting any help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even with the ideal angle, which he absolutely does not have, pulling such large feathers out would hurt. With the shitty angle, a feeling of strong resolve, and his own stupid \u2018rip the baindaid off now and cry later\u2019 mentality, he knows that the bathroom is going to be a mess of blood and Hawks is going to be sobbing around his clenched fist by the time he\u2019s done. With this in mind, he keeps going. Flinging the bloody feather behind him, Hawks\u2019 trembling fingers reach for another feather, his wings jerking away from his touch like they\u2019re trying to escape from him. Wrapping his fingers around another, he twists and pulls and screams into his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twist and pull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He bites into his fist and tastes blood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twist and pull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His knees threaten to buckle, and he almost concusses himself on the edge of his sink counter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twist and pull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blood makes his grip slippery, but he doesn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twist and pull.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stop, he has to pull his ruined flight feathers out so that the new ones can grow in. It\u2019s necessary, even if each feather adds to the bloody mess on his back and sends agony through his wings. His floor is covered in long, boxy feathers, each one leaving its own stain on the light tile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand is so covered in blood that it looks like he\u2019s wearing a glove.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0He doesn\u2019t stop, despite the pain and the mess he\u2019s making of his bathroom floor, because this is something that he <em>has</em> to do. His feathers aren\u2019t self-healing, it\u2019s out with the old, in with the new, like teeth. He can't help but compare it to taking a set of pliers to his own mouth; there's a bad angle, a lot of pain, no way to get a clear visual, and better left to a professional. So yeah, it's like pulling teeth that aren't ready to come out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hawks just has to take the old out himself, which sucks. And without control of her feathers he can\u2019t release them, so they\u2019re coming out the hard way. If he could push past the pain, or if there were only a few feathers that had to be pulled, things would be fine. But his wings are big, so big that they cover the mirror in front of him, and it\u2019s a lot of hard, painful, bloody work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0His shaking fingers are gripping the base of a feather closer to his back than the other ones, almost halfway done with the whole horrible grooming session from hell, when a shockingly cold hand reaches under his wing and grabs him and he hears a tired, \u201cHawks, what the <em>fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just cries around his hand, meeting Dabi\u2019s eye\u2019s in the mirror as the villain slowly forces his wing down from it\u2019s arched position. The villain almost looks lazy, meeting his eyes in the mirror and raising a cool eyebrow. He\u2019s calm, cool, and collected, smirking like he thinks that he\u2019s caught Hawks having a long overdue teenage breakdown, until he releases the wing in his grip and that expression is washed away like sidewalk chalk in the rain. When he lets go, there\u2019s blood on his hand, covering his palm like people do with red paint to stamp their hand prints for DIY art projects. Hawks wonders how many times he could print his own hand, absently watching a bead of blood slide down his wrist in the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the villain demands harshly, staring down at his red palm in surprise and grabbing the wing that he had just let go of. Hawks shakes his head again with a muffled whine, unwilling to take his hand out of his mouth. Cold fingers grab his face harshly, the other hand grabbing his fist and ripping it from his mouth. His canines scrape against the skin, leaving small gashes in the back of his hand. Mission accomplished, Dabi drops his hand. Hawks heaves in a ragged gasp now that his mouth isn\u2019t full of his hand, and he stutters his way through the shortest and simplest answer that he can give.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to get them <em>out</em>, or new ones can\u2019t grow <em>in</em>, like teeth,\u201d Hawks croaks with a small, humorless laugh at his own expense, reaching back for another feather while Dabi tries to process what he just said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure that-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a sharp twist of his wrist, and a scream that he quickly smothers by biting into his hand again, he pulls out another feather. It\u2019s the last one for that wing, which he lets drop to the floor in a useless heap immediately, almost taking Dabi down with it. Blood smears across the floor, still oozing out of where the feathers used to be, and the villain stares down at it while Hawks feels a wave of relief so strong that he almost falls over. His wing, without the pain of cut feathers being ripped out, feels heavy and numb and it\u2019s absolute bliss compared to what it had been. It takes less than a second for him to decide that it\u2019s a lot better than having the feathers cut, and he's desperate to do the rest. Hawks turns his attention to the other wing, fingers reaching for the closest feather that\u2019s been giving him pain. Dabi\u2019s hand grabs his and yanks it down before letting go, like he trusts that Hawks isn\u2019t going to raise it again to do what needs to be done. He's wrong, but the trust is nice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck- <em>stop that</em>, birdie. Just <em>stop</em> for a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks ignores him and reaches for another one again, and Dabi slaps his hand away this time. His wing\u2019s twitch, the one on the ground hitting the villains foot as it slides across the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks meets his eyes in the mirror and shakes his head. It\u2019s a loaded question, and he\u2019s not going to answer it with the truth. Going off of the look he shares with Dabi, the villain knows this, he doesn\u2019t expect the truth, but is asking for it anyway. Hawks isn\u2019t sure when Dabi stopped hating him (if he ever did) enough to care about what he does to his wings. Yeah, they're chill during league meetings, and they can get along well enough to kick ass sometimes during game nights, but that's it. Hawks has always gotten the feeling that Dabi doesn't like him all that much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBad haircut,\u201d Hawks half-lies through his teeth, smiling in slight humor despite his blotchy, tear streaked face. If he wore makeup, it would undoubtedly be running down his face, and he could complete the look of a girl who didn\u2019t win prom queen and is throwing a fit in the bathroom during prom. The villain picks up a pulled feather from the floor, looking at the clean cut ends, and his face shutters just enough for Hawks to notice the difference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHawks, who did it?\u201d Dabi asks, keeping his voice light, like he\u2019s asking about how the hero\u2019s patrol went. It's a far cry from his question when he had stopped by earlier of 'what did you do', and Hawks isn't sure why Dabi now thinks that he didn't do it. He's not about to join the 'self-mutilation' club, but he still wonders why the villain thinks that Hawks wouldn't do this to himself. he had done it to himself, in a way; his punishment was linked to his crime.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Hawks,\" Dabi calls, trying to get him to answer. It\u2019s the same tone that his Handler uses when he\u2019s done something wrong, and he curls into himself just a little bit at the thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\u201cHawks, you know why this is necessary, don\u2019t you?\u201d his Handler asks, leading him down the hallway towards his commission-made appointment. She\u2019s activated her quirk, a subtle way of telling him that she doesn\u2019t want an actual answer. He nods slowly, unable to speak without a voice, and she smiles at him like he\u2019s done the right thing. If he\u2019s being honest, he likes that expression more on the people that he saves; something about seeing such a fake copy of it on his Handlers face makes him feel wrong, somehow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d she smiles quickly before letting it drop from her face, and Hawks knows that it was as fake as it always is as she leads him into the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the same room that it\u2019s always been, but now there\u2019s a bar on the wall, similar to a pull up bar, but set too low for someone his height.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is for you to grab, and we\u2019ll <em>allow</em> a stress grip this time,\u201d she tells him, warning clear in her voice that this is the only exception. Hawks finds his voice when she lets him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice is taken away again, and the look he gets is chilling. \u201cAsking why is <em>ungrateful</em>, Hawks,\u201d his Handler frowns at him and he ducks his head before she sighs and tells him,</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou broke through the restraints last time, as I\u2019m sure you remember. Allowing you to secure yourself with your own body is more cost effective, and you won\u2019t be able to let go during the process and accidentally hurt someone or damage yourself. It\u2019s a win-win, and very effective for all parties,\u201d she explains with a bored tone, like she\u2019s not talking about using his own quirk against him so that she can do what she wants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks nods again, trying to swallow past the fear in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice is back, but he doesn\u2019t say anything else.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi snaps his fingers in his face, and it takes Hawks a second to realize that Dabi is actually in front of him now, he\u2019s not just staring at the man in the mirror. The villain has squeezed himself between Hawks' body and the counter, and he's standing uncomfortable close. Hawks stares at the villain dazedly, and he gets a much sharper stare back. Zoning out with a short tempered villain is going to be the death of him someday soon, if not <em>today</em>. The villain in question looks impatient, getting more aggravated with every passing second. He sharply gestures in a \u2018well, tell me\u2019 gesture that Hawks flinches back from the slightest bit. He knows that Dabi catches it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRepeat the question?\u201d Hawks asks, tacking on a charming press-worthy smile for good measure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi looks at him like he\u2019s an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t even care anymore. I'm still gonna fix it for you,\u201d Dabi grunts, like Hawks has begged for his help without even speaking. Maybe he had. It would really be a lot easier to have someone else do it, a lot less painful. In this scenario where he gets help, the one helping him ideally wouldn\u2019t be an S rank villain who\u2019s never had a problem hurting people he doesn\u2019t like, and up until around ten minutes ago Hawks had been sure that he fit in that very large box. The thought of having his wings touched more than fleetingly by Dabi scares him, if he\u2019s being honest. His hesitation must be horrible obvious, because Dabi rolls his eyes at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0A cold hand grabs his wrist, the one that\u2019s not horribly bloody, and drags him out to his living room. The jerking movement of being dragged around snaps him out of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cNo, not necessary, we\u2019re not doing that. I\u2019ll do it myself, you don't need to work for a 'good deed' sticker,\u201d Hawks protests, trying to dig his heels into the carpet of his hallway. He\u2019s wearing socks, and it hardly even slows Dabi down; he just drags Hawks behind him. He can do his own wings, it\u2019s fine. He would rather do them himself and make a bloody mess of his wings than have them burnt off because Dabi doesn\u2019t actually like him enough for this to not be a trick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can hear you thinking, shut up,\u201d the villain snaps, not turning around and not slowing down in the slightest. Hawks swears that Dabi is letting his numb wing run into door frames on purpose, but he can\u2019t exactly un-numb it and do something about his suspicions, so he just lets it happen and winces at each thunk. Yeah, Dabi definitely doesn\u2019t like him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually, the reluctant choo-choo train of pain and embarrassment comes to a stop in Hawks\u2019 living room, where Dabi shoves him face first into the couch so forcefully that he has to stop himself from slamming his face into the back of it. Hawks immediately is trying to push himself back, not even caring if he falls on his ass, because they\u2019re not doing this. Hawks refuses to just let Dabi pull feathers out-</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Dabi man-handles him back onto the couch, uncaring of the way that Hawks tenses and thrashes just the slightest bit. He can't put up a decent fight with one wing numb and the other lighting up in pain like a pinball machine every time he tries to move it. The last time he turned his back to someone, he was made flightless and put into this awful situation in the first place, and that person was an official <em>government employee</em>. Hawks tries not to shiver at the reminder. His numb wing is lifted and tossed semi-carefully onto the couch next to him, and Hawks reaches out to it and pulls it closer to him protectively. It twitches in his hold, but remains loose and numb. Blood is smeared across his cream sofa, and it's definitely going to stain the already ugly thing. His other wing tries to curl closer to him but it grabbed by cold hands and pinned with one while the other pushes Hawks further into the couch. The hand remains firm when Hawks struggles against it, and he hears Dabi sigh at him in exasperation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re that scared, grab the back of the couch or something, but this is happening-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks eyes trace his wing that\u2019s still numb as his blood rushes in his ears, only half-listening. Slowly, his hands reach up to grab the back of the couch and he hangs his head between his hunched and shaking shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a mirror image of what happened three days ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That thought alone has his fingers clenching anxiously, tearing into the back of the couch and keeping him in place. A cold hand smooths over his shaking back cautiously, seemingly to calm him down. If he could forget who's hand it was, it might have worked better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Dabi says, awkwardly petting his back in between his wings. Hawks relaxes a little bit more for every pass of his fingers over the small feathers, and the other man doesn\u2019t make any move to do anything else any time soon. Which is probably why the feeling of a feather being yanked loose makes him jerk and chirp in pained surprise. A hand, heated to be just relaxing enough that Hawks calms down faster, soothes over his smaller feathers again before another cut feather is pulled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Dabi doing the pulling, it\u2019s almost <em>painless</em>. Hawks doesn\u2019t get any warning, doesn\u2019t have time to tense up and make it worse for himself, before a feather is yanked out, and he\u2019s better off for it. There\u2019s no blood because Dabi has the perfect angle, so the feathers aren\u2019t tearing at the thin skin of his wings when they come out, and all he can feel is relief as the warm hand remains pressed to his back. Despite this, he never relaxes enough to release his grip on the back of the couch, all too aware that he\u2019s a sitting duck and completely at the mercy of the man at his back. The second that Dabi wants to hurt him, he has the option, and even if Hawks doesn't think the guy hates him as much as he used to, he knows that he often brings out the worst in people. It's a talent, really, and it only gets stronger when he's around people like Dabi, for completely unknown reasons.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally the last feather is pulled out with a sudden yank, and the creeping numb relief that creeps through his previously tense wing almost makes him cry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou good, pretty bird?\u201d Dabi drawls lazily, carding his fingers through the wing as it slumps against the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks nods at him tiredly, his head still buried from view. His hands flex around the back of the couch, and he winces a little bit. With the rest of his body being so relaxed, it almost feels like his hands are cramping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"My hands hurt,\" Hawks breathes, closing his eyes and trying to just enjoy his wings <em>not</em> hurting for the fist time in days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi\u2019s eyebrows furrow, \u201cthen let go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>can\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, why <em>not</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too stressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi eyes his wings, both feathery puddles of numb bliss at his sides, and raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sure</em> you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t be letting go for a while,\u201d Hawks tells him, resting his cheek on the back of the couch sullenly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pleasantly warm fingers run through the feathers on his left wing while the other hand continues to rest on his back, and Dabi laughs at him when he melts further into the couch. After a few minutes of comfortable silence, Dabi\u2019s hands never leaving his wings, Hawks speaks up.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe commission thinks that I use my wings too much, and I need to learn to live without relying on them,\u201d Hawks mumbles, rubbing his face into his clenched hands like he can sooth them into letting go of the couch. The hand in his wing stutters to a halt and the one on his back stops its soft petting. A small chirp leaves him in complaint, which Dabi huffs at slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey think you use <em>your quirk, </em>the one that <em>saves lives</em>, too much,\u201d Dabi repeats with a bitchy tone, resuming running his blessedly heated fingers through Hawks\u2019 wing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks wishes that he had a pillow up to act as a barrier between his hands and his face, \u201cyeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo they did clipped your wings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other pillow is chucked off of the couch and on to the floor, \u201cuh huh. It\u2019s alright though-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>bullshit</em>, birdie, and you know it,\u201d Dabi cuts him off, his hands getting slightly hotter as they continue to bury themselves into Hawks\u2019 feathers. It feels amazing, and his brain is trying to fill with foggy bliss, but he has to focus. He wiggles a little bit, trying to get less comfortable so he can address this thing that\u2019s happening right now. Pull the weed before it grows and stuff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <em>own</em> me, you know that. I can't really do anything about it,\u201d Hawks mutters, using his head to nudge the pillow over the back of the couch and on to the floor. Dabi\u2019s hands clench in his feathers, earning him a hiss from Hawks, before he catches himself and lets go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a <em>thing</em>?\u201d Dabi demands, leaning closer in order to be able to look Hawks in the eye without stopping what he\u2019s doing. Hawks feels his eyebrows furrow, \u201cyeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit, that <em>sucks</em>,\u201d Dabi says eloquently, leaning back. The response is so lackluster that Hawks slowly turns to stare at him with both eyebrows raised.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, did you think I was <em>kidding</em> when I said that?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a sharing circle, I make stuff up <em>all the time</em>,\u201d Dabi defends, not meeting his eyes as he switches to the other wing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make up stuff during the <em>team bonding</em> exercises?\u201d Hawks shrieks at him in disbelief. <em>Yeah</em>, Hawks himself is guilty of omitting information and telling half-truths because his life is depressing and he only figured that out when Mr. Compress had started to sniffle during the first circle. Hawks can't handle his own emotions, not to mention other peoples. So he deflects, but just <em>making something up</em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Wow. That's a <em>dick</em> <em>move</em>, Hot stuff.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks can feel the way that Dabi shrugs in response, his hands shifting against his feathers. Silence fills the space between them, only broken by the small chirps Hawks can\u2019t hold back and the little huff of laughter that Dabi gave each one. It\u2019s annoying that he can\u2019t stay quiet, but the villain has magic hands that would have gotten him places.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hands fall over the edge of the couch\u2019s back, fingers lax as Hawks tries not to slide off and become a puddle on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Dabi notices he doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead, one of his hands slides out of the wing and guides an arm around Hawks, just holding him, while his other hand continues to soothe his wing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0It\u2019s nice, being held like he\u2019s something to be cherished instead of just used. The arm around his wait tightens before gently pulling him back, closer to the man behind him like they're in a couple's yoga class.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks stares ahead with wide eyes, but he doesn\u2019t make a move to resist when Dabi pulls him closer by his waist. The villain pulls him back until Hawks can feel a long press of heat across his back, sandwiching his wings between them in a way that's just careful enough to not make them uncomfortable. Even though he can't feel them, it's a sweet sentiment. Maybe it\u2019s the regard for his wings, maybe it\u2019s the intense heat at his back, or maybe it\u2019s the bonding moment that they had just shared- that they <em>continue</em>\u00a0to share, but-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks makes the first move, turning in Dabi\u2019s arms until he can crush their mouths together. It\u2019s a weird angle, and Hawks still feels a little too much like a puddle to really get into it, but it\u2019s still perfect. The scarred bottom lip isn\u2019t rough like he thought it would be, and Dabi is both wonderfully warm and refreshingly cold at the same time. As if reading his mind, Dabi huffs a laugh into the kiss, and Hawks can feel the villain\u2019s smile against his own. They don\u2019t take it any further, both content to keep it in their pants (for now) and just enjoy each others company.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few minutes and a changed position later, Dabi looks down at where Hawks' head rests on his lap. Hawks looks back at him questioningly, pausing in his rant about not being able to go anywhere while he tries to shift into a more comfortable position.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can still <em>drive</em> places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks stays silent, pausing in his quest to get more comfortable. His sudden stillness catches the villain\u2019s attention quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pretty bird</em>,\u201d Dabi calls, drawing the term of endearment out, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t <em>drive</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks feels his shoulders hunch a little bit and he pretends like he\u2019s not avoiding eye contact</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my gods, you <em>can\u2019t</em>,\u201d Dabi crows in delight at his expense, leaning down to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks fluffs up indignantly, \u201cI never had to learn, I can <em>fly</em>!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dabi snorts at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cApparently not,\u201d he mutters, and Hawks feels himself turning red. Dabi catches it and pats his head mockingly as Hawks buries his face into the villain\u2019s thigh, hoping to suffocate himself so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you too <em>old</em> to be grounded?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawks throws an elbow into Dabi\u2019s side, making the villain gasp for breath, and smiles innocently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOops.\u201d</p>"
