  "summary": "<p><em>Natasha looked more closely. She first saw hints of a second person in the sock poking out of the blanket at a strange angle, and the pale hand with curled-up fingers resting on Tony\u2019s chest. Then she found a head of what looked like brown curls, tucked snugly under Tony\u2019s arm. And eventually, a second set of sleeping breaths, slow and light.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p>The Avengers return from months of missions to find a child fast asleep on the lounge, with Tony snoring beside him. A mystery ensues.<br>Is Tony Stark a father? (It looks like it!) How have they never discovered the kid until now? I mean, Iron Man has always been good at keeping secrets, but a whole CHILD?</p>\n<p>Rhodey could trace the shock residually plastered through every crease and curve of the other man\u2019s face. Natasha still had a particularly pensive expression, sure, but Clint was floored. He looked like he had a concussion.</p>\n<p>Maybe he did. Maybe that was a side effect of finding Tony Stark asleep on the couch <em>next to a kid</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s yours, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Rhodey asked quietly. \u201cYour son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony opened and closed his mouth. Like a fish. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint leant forward to end the recording, but now that Tony was finished talking the quiet \u2018beep!\u2019 the phone made was highly audible.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d he whispered, and quickly sent the video off to the Rogue Avengers\u2019 group chat, with the caption, \u2018Proof Stark has a son\u2019.</p>\n<p>Sam flew through something sticky and flailed around in the air for a second before righting himself. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he spluttered. He recognised the feeling, but; \u201ca spiderweb? What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>The door to the lab slid mechanically open, to reveal a genius-billionaire-playboy-pilanthropist-<em>possibly-dad</em> according to the team\u2019s conspiracy theories; and a slender, surprised-faced teen with brown curls standing awkwardly half-behind him.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was better that the Rogues didn\u2019t sit in on this particular board meeting.</p>\n<p>At least it wasn\u2019t as bad as the time he jumped onto the ceiling by accident because his pencil had rolled to the very edge of the table and the back of his neck felt like a bomb was about to go off.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cColonel Rhodes has informed you on multiple occasions that you do not have to force yourself into threatening or vulnerable situations, but he encourages you to converse with Steve Rogers, as it may be a healthy way to resolve your emotions.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already awake,\u201d Peter cut in suddenly, without moving his head. </p>\n<p>Yep. That was a voice Steve recognised, holy shit. Conspiracy confirmed.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>So this is basically my first //idea// in the IronDad fandom... I took a few classic tropes (Peter meets the Avengers, Field Trip to Stark Industries, Everyone Thinks Peter and Tony are related) and just rolled them together with a massive bundle of fluff. And added a slight twist, which is that the Avengers think [censored due to spoilers] [sorry not sorry!]<br>There'll be ten chapters, but they won't be posted regularly.</p>\n<p>Argh I can't believe how mentally exhausting it is to write \"candy\" every time instead of \"lolly\"... American spelling is driving me nuts. Sorry, guys, you might end up with a weird mix of \"colour\" but then \"candy\"... If there's something blaringly not-American let me know.</p>\n<p>In case anybody was wondering about the whole mammoth milk thing in the last chapter (I know I was) both mammoths and elephants actually do produce milk. However, its toxic to humans, so no giant buckets of mammoth-milk carried around by little cave-men. And no mammoth cheese.</p>\n<p>Sadly.</p>\n<p>Many, many, endless thanks to everybody who enjoyed the first chapter of this story (and everybody who didn't enjoy too, I guess)! Your feedback and kudos meant so much to me!!</p>\n<p>Hi! It's been a while!</p>\n<p>Here's some sleepy-confused-and-a-bit-irritated Tony. And some Peter, too.</p>\n<p>I'm back in lockdown; going through online learning number 2, and I've got one thing to say. Not. Fun.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I've been meaning to finished this chapter for aaages but my computer was confiscated twice and then my notepad went through the wash, so there's that.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to everybody who reads, comments, leaves kudos, and bookmarks, have a wonderful day; and please stay covid-safe!! Wear a mask!!</p>\n<p>So, I've been asked to update... and I have! (Suprise!)</p>\n<p>Aaaah, hello!! It's been a little longer than I'd hoped... I lost my planning sheet for about the fifth time but I can mostly still remember what happens so I'm just going to roll with it. I'm a bit of a disaster sometimes so idk.</p>\n<p>A million thanks to everybody who is leaving kudos, bookmarks, comments... you guys are amazing and I absolutely, 100% wouldn't have the motivation to do this without you, you're pretty much the only reason this fic is alive in the first place!! I can't say thank you enough!!</p>\n<p>I've discovered that wanting to write and actually writing are too very different things. Sadly. But. I will promise that I will have the next chapter done and up by... well, how about before the weekend?</p>\n<p>(PS Also, Bucky's whole character did a 180 and just... I'm sorry. I couldn't fix it; and it didn't want to be fixed.)</p>\n<p>THERE IS AN ART. SOUND THE ALARM. SKBRIFUEDKJN PLEASE GO CHECK IT OUT <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/fluffyartbl0g/674346754376974336\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE!</a> ITS REALLY REALLY AWESOME AND THe person who made it is spectacular and i love them, you can check them out on tumblr @fluffyartbl0g and hand on my deepest respects</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>oH nO... nAt'S cLoSiNg iN!!!!<br>Sorry, Bruce, but she's literally the only person on the team with a braincell at the moment.</p>\n<p>(Sorry for the enormous delay! I really truly am sorry! Plus I hate this chapter it was a bitch to write and I didn't edit or read through at all so if you find mistakes please correct me in the comments!)</p>\n<p>Hello all you wonderful people!<br>Now, I'm sorry for going slightly AWOL during the holidays, I promise it's not permanent!! &lt;3 Not sure when the next chapter will arrive but I have no intention of deserting this fic so rest in peace etc. I love all your comments and kudos, they make my day!! Thank you!!</p>\n<p>PS I'd also like to extend a formal apology to the absence of Wanda, Vision, Thor, and the whole concept of canon. My eyes are suddenly open to the many painful holes in this fic, so if you're actually enjoying this, you get extra credit. I don't know what's happening with my brain at all.</p>\n<p>Happy New Year's Eve!</p>\n<p>I'd first like to make it quite clear to everyone who commented and left kudos that this chapter is dedicated to you. I wrote it for you and it belongs entirely, to you.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I'd like to explain away my absence as being the fault of Merlin and Good Omens (I love them both very much) which led my wandering feet very far from this work at times.</p>\n<p>Have a wonderful day, and if you've been waiting for this chapter, I applaud you for your patience.</p>\n<p><strike>*rocks up three months late with a multiverse plot*</strike> sssh what are you talking about</p>\n<p>So I started watching the Mandalorian and then I wrote like, half a chapter of this and half a chapter of that other series and half a chapter of something else entirely before I started thinking about how many fic plots I have written down in total and BOOM! This fic is gonna be part of a series which will, eventually, join a Multiverse. </p>\n<p>Also, I started this chapter like, \"I don't ship Stucky that much!\" and then, rereading this chapter.... uhh....</p>\n<p>nkjrefhdwkjn ive got a hundred and one things to do and of course i choose to do this ugh</p>\n<p>sorry for the very long delay i got bored. it happens sometimes. thankfully this is the last chapter so you dont have to worry about that happening again! in other words, thanks for coming on this journey. as something i started purely to get myself comfortable 1. being in a fandom outside of my head, 2. fumbling my way into things i liked and finding things i didn't like, and 3. posting online; this fic took off much more than i thought it would, so thanks to the <em>five and a half thousand</em> people who left kudos (holy shit there's so many of you)</p>\n<p>this last chapter, as always, is for you. </p>\n<p>ps. i gave up on american spelling, im not sorry.</p>",
  "text": "<p>The night mist cleared. City lights glowed against the glass and steel facades of the skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>\u201c30 minutes to landing,\u201d the speakers crackled.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do elephants produce milk?\u201d Clint asked. He swallowed a mouthful of gummy bears before continuing with, \u201cdid woolly mammoth\u2019s give milk? Did cave people ever make mammoth\u2019s cheese?\u201d</p>\n<p>They were close enough to watch the plane\u2019s reflection glide around on the dark patches of the city, broken by the glass into little pieces. \u201cHell, what is wrong with you, featherhead?\u201d Natasha snorted from her stance by the window.</p>\n<p>The man giggled. \u201cCan you imagine little cave men milking their woolly mammoths?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sam replied, a traumatised note to his voice. \u201cAnd I never thought I ever would until this conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough candy for you now.\u201d Steve scooped up the bowl, glanced at it once, and made the wisest decision \u2013 which was passing it immediately into the arms of the person sitting to his left.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Bucky complained. \u201cHow did I end up with custody of the most prized possession on the goddamn plane?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat baby\u2019s all yours,\u201d Steve grinned, and leaned over to brush his boyfriend\u2019s lips. \u201cKeep it safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rolling his eyes at the couple, Sam put up a sneaky hand. Another few handfuls of (almost) pure sugar disappeared. Bucky scowled protectively, shoved him away, and held the bowl closer. It nestled perfectly in the crook of his metal arm.</p>\n<p>Natasha had forgotten how large and bright New York could be. The wet black sky surrounding the small jet was the greatest contrast it could be to the golden metropolis sprawled out below. She touched a fingertip to the cold glass window. A quiet voice behind her said, \u201cit will be good to be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce watched Natasha as she pictured Tony Stark\u2019s indignant face when the Avengers told him they hadn\u2019t waited for his private jet to pick them up from the airport, instead renting a small charter. The vote had been unanimous \u2013 none of the Avengers would choose waiting for a comfortable flight over getting to the Tower sooner. Natasha\u2019s mouth twisted upward. \u201cYes,\u201d she told Bruce. \u201cIt will be good to be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did tell Tony when we\u2019re due to arrive, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Bucky asked, slightly worried.</p>\n<p>Steve screwed up his nose. \u201cYes, and he said he had a project to work on but he\u2019d try crawling out of his lab at some point to say hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis words or yours?\u201d Clint laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost 3 in the morning.\u201d Bucky sounded surprised. \u201cDoes he sleep, like, ever?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Avengers shook their heads. \u201cGuy runs on coffee,\u201d Bruce explained.</p>\n<p>\u201c20 minutes to landing,\u201d said the speakers from the corner of the ceiling. \u201cYou want me to drop you at the airport?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAvengers Tower, Stark Industries,\u201d Natasha remedied. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a small runway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the pilot replied. Natasha left her seat and casually swiped the bowl of candy from Bucky. \u201cIn that case, 5 minutes to landing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Sam supplied, \u201cI can see the Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p>It glittered silver. Avengers Tower easily dwarfed the rest of the block, smooth sides soaring higher than the boxy apartments and offices surrounding. It was an elegant shape, Natasha mused, crunching on candy. As much as a building could have grace and poise.</p>\n<p>Hell, she was tired. It was getting to the point where the constant weight of the spare dagger strapped to her leg was an ache rather than a reassurance. Where even her fingerless gloves felt like they were weighing her down.</p>\n<p>She flicked her gaze to the others. Yeah, they were tired, too. Forget suitcases, those were body-bags under Bruce\u2019s calm eyes. And the rest of the team who weren\u2019t hyped up on sugar (read: just Rhodey) had dull expressions and slumped shoulders. The last five chaotic months had seen mission after mission, only remotely assisted by Tony, taking them far and wide and beyond by never with a chance to break.</p>\n<p>Natasha couldn\u2019t wait to just collapse in her room and pass out. Not that she\u2019d ever let anybody know that. The Black Widow retained her dignity now matter how exhausted she became, please and thank you.</p>\n<p>Oh but hell, she was tired.</p>\n<p>The plane shuddered slightly as they landed. Natasha balanced the bowl of food on her knees with, to her credit, only slightly less agility than as per usual. None of the candies spilled to the floor, so the woman stood and began moving toward the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Nat, slow down,\u201d Clint began. She turned loose a frostily unimpressed look. \u201cI mean,\u201d he stammered, \u201cwe haven\u2019t even stopped moving completely yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I agree with Natasha,\u201d Rhodes said. He shot the low ceiling a dark glance and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cGet me the hell off this plane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Bucky pointed out with a snort, nudging Steve.</p>\n<p>Eventually the door was unlocked and the Avengers clambered down the makeshift stairs one at a time. It was relieving to escape the cramped space and suck in deep breaths of cold (and polluted) night air.</p>\n<p>The pilot unloaded their luggage onto the smooth concrete. There wasn\u2019t much of it: just a small suitcase or two between them and various duffel bags of different sizes and colours. Steve thanked her and the woman, obviously uncomfortable with the knowledge that she\u2019d just flown seven <em>superheroes</em> to the private runway above <em>Stark Industries</em>, disappeared back inside the plane. The team picked up their luggage (a little unenthusiastically) and turned to face the glass double doors.</p>\n<p>Tony wasn\u2019t waiting for them.</p>\n<p>Granted, they weren\u2019t exactly expecting it. Okay, let\u2019s be fair, although they had told themselves not to expect it, almost all of them had been silently hoping to see a welcoming face.</p>\n<p>Natasha squashed down the brief flash of disappointment into something unidentifiable and led the way inside.</p>\n<p>Several employees greeted them, and a janitor professed that he was glad the team were back, but when they all stepped into the elevator and the silver doors slid shut, all they could feel was awkward silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo much for Tony,\u201d Clint snorted.</p>\n<p>Bucky rubbed his metal arm, a tad nervously. After all, this would be only his second visit to the Tower. Tony had waved a hand in the air and proclaimed the events of the \u201cCivil War\u201d over, but he had been remarkably reluctant to join the team on missions. And they\u2019d only really dropped by the Tower once after for a few hours for a team meeting when the Accords had been mended, so bonding time had been overlooked.</p>\n<p>For now, though, Natasha was going to take Tony at his word and assume they were welcome. She had bigger things to worry about. Like sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cLevel 98, Avengers quarters,\u201d FRIDAY chimed as the doors eased open. \u201cPlease keep your voice down.\u201d</p>\n<p>They drabbled into the room, too physically drained to think carefully about what the AI had told them. Natasha made a beeline for the room she\u2019d stayed in before, and to her pleasure it was still plainly hers. The bed was oak and the handles of the bedside cabinets were steel. She lit one of the large lamps angled next to the bed and sighed gratefully.</p>\n<p>Clint made a choking noise just outside the bedroom door.</p>\n<p>Natasha let her stuff fall on the floor and slipped back down the hallway. The team were huddled together behind the glowingly polished island bench of a large kitchen, staring open-mouthed at the living space adjoining.</p>\n<p>Natasha blinked. A man was asleep on the lounge.</p>\n<p>No, Tony Stark was asleep on the lounge. Tony Stark, a qualified insomniac, who had once stayed up for ninety-six hours straight, was wrapped in a blanket with his feet up and his head back, honest-to-god <em>snoring</em>.</p>\n<p>Clint made the choking sound again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d was Bruce\u2019s only reaction. He sounded vaguely impressed.</p>\n<p>Bucky shook his head. \u201cThis does not match the image of Tony Stark I was given by you lot,\u201d he reprimanded, glancing at the list of movie credits still scrolling on the TV screen. \u201cI never-- wait. Is that a kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha looked more closely. She first saw hints of a second person in the sock poking out of the blanket at a strange angle, and the pale hand with curled-up fingers resting on Tony\u2019s chest. Then she found a head of what looked like brown curls, tucked snugly under Tony\u2019s arm. And eventually, a second set of sleeping breaths, slow and light.</p>\n<p>It looked so\u2026 intimate. Tony\u2019s face was so gentle. Softer than Natasha had ever seen. He was wearing a T-shirt instead of a suit, and Natasha could\u2019ve sworn the man slept in his suit. He had one hand clutching the blanket and the other with his fingers woven through the kid\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThat\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Avengers stared at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot just that,\u201d Rhodey added disbelievingly, and pointed. \u201cYou see the hoodie that kid\u2019s wearing? Well, I\u2019d know that hoodie anywhere. That\u2019s Tones\u2019 precious MIT jumper. Most favourite piece of clothing he owns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint finally found his voice. \u201cBut Tony never shares his jumpers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha nodded. \u201cWe know\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Eventually they had been standing there long enough with their mouths open that Rhodey felt the need to do something. He ushered the team down the hallway and into the room set aside for him.</p>\n<p>They gathered around the bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cStark and a kid,\u201d Sam was repeating. \u201cThat was a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey nodded wearily. He didn\u2019t know what to do. This was more trouble than he\u2019d been expecting, and that was saying something, since he\u2019d been prepared for the outbreak of Civil War number two. He\u2019d decided on the plane over exactly what kinds of platitudes would be needed for the team, and mentally prepared a calming speech for Tony. It wouldn\u2019t work, of course; Tony only listened to his best friend when he was being either exceptionally wise or exceptionally stupid, but it was a good plan. Because Rhodey would do almost anything to stop the team disintegrating further. That was why he\u2019d been by the former Rogues' sides through all the recent missions. </p>\n<p>He knew Tony. He knew how much he\u2019d been hurt by what the media were calling the Avenger\u2019s Civil War. He\u2019d witnessed Tony\u2019s nightmares when Pepper hadn\u2019t been there, and talked him through panic attacks in the young hours of the morning because a sound, a sight, had reminded the man of the battle. He\u2019d been there when Tony threw up in the toilet sixteen nights in a row.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019d seen the blueprints of the armour that he\u2019d worn. Complete with a shattered, jagged curve where the arc reactor should have been.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know how the team was ever going to be that again. A <em>team</em>. A complete set.</p>\n<p>Even just friendly acquaintances would be good at this point.</p>\n<p>So the whole prevent-another-fight thing was a good plan. A plan wholly overthrown by the fact that Tony wasn\u2019t worked up and crisising after all. In fact it was the complete opposite. He was sound asleep.</p>\n<p>Rhodey was fairly sure he\u2019d never even seen the man voluntarily fall asleep. And this was voluntary. That much was obvious. The way the child was nestled so <em>safely</em> into Tony was absolute proof. And the older man\u2019s fingers\u2026 Tony must have fallen asleep carding gently through the kid\u2019s curls.</p>\n<p>To say nothing of the jumper. That was nothing short of a miracle.</p>\n<p>It was the purest thing Rhodey had ever witnessed. And coming from Tones, also the most unexpected.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo who\u2019s the kid?\u201d Steve asked.</p>\n<p>It took Rhodey quite a minute to realise everybody in the room was staring at <em>him</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I know?\u201d he spluttered.</p>\n<p>They glared at him like it was a given he could read minds. </p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019re Tony\u2019s best friend,\u201d Steve pointed out. \u201cOut of everyone here you\u2019re definitely the\u2026 closest to him.\u201d </p>\n<p>A slight awkwardness settled over Rhodey\u2019s room, because of course they all once were close to Tony. It was washed mostly away by the following, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you know who the kid is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I--\u201c Rhodey looked at Clint, who rolled his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be any help. We were all fucking criminals five months ago, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey could trace the shock residually plastered through every crease and curve of the other man\u2019s face. Natasha still had a particularly pensive expression, sure, but Clint was floored. He looked like he had a concussion.</p>\n<p>Maybe he did. Maybe that was a side effect of finding Tony Stark asleep on the couch <em>next to a kid</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly been around,\u201d Bruce admitted.</p>\n<p>They all looked expectantly to Rhodey again.</p>\n<p>Rhodey was confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just as surprised as the rest of us,\u201d Natasha said.</p>\n<p>Sam, who had quickly formed an opinion of his own, was caught off guard. \u201cStark didn\u2019t even tell <em>you</em>? Damn. That must hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint caught on. \u201cTurns out he didn\u2019t really ever trust any of us...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me <em>what</em>? Trust us with <em>what</em>?\u201d Rhodey repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Sam asked. \u201cThat was a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all nodded and thought for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was <em>his</em> kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that single sentence summed it all up. Tony Stark had a son.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck\u2026?\u201d Bucky said wonderingly. \u201cHow old would he be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe must be\u2026 oh, in middle school at least,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cProbably older. I mean, think about Stark's past.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGenius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist,\u201d Bruce mused.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd nobody knew? Tony kept him secret <em>this whole time</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be,\u201d said Bruce.</p>\n<p>They were all beginning to freak out now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo for more than a decade, Stark had a child hiding out in the Tower?\u201d Clint screeched. \u201cAnd we never even noticed?\u201d</p>\n<p>He collapsed onto Rhodey\u2019s bed, complaining, \u201cI thought I was the only one with a secret family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god.\u201d All eyes turned to Steve, who suddenly looked sick. \u201cI broke his suit \u2013 when we fought in Siberia \u2013 I smashed the arc reactor and almost killed him and just left and, and\u2026\u201d The words spilled out at unnatural angles. His voice, already roughened, dropped lower. \u201cAnd all that time he must have had a child waiting for him to come home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wonder he packed us off on missions halfway round the world as soon as he could,\u201d Sam groaned. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want us around his kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood reason, too,\u201d Steve said piously, and for the first time since Rhodey had worked with him after the Accords he looked <em>sorry</em>. Like all the frustration and remorse he\u2019d had boxed up inside him was finally slipping through.</p>\n<p>Maybe reconciliation would be easier than Rhodey had thought. And all it had taken was a sleeping kid.</p>\n<p>A <em>mystery</em> sleeping kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Natasha, \u201cI\u2019m going to find who this kid is that Stark has conjured.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey agreed. Whoever the hell could get Tony to sleep would be worth knowing. </p>\n<p>He still doubted the child was actually Tony\u2019s, but he had a sneaky suspicion that was only because he was in denial that his oldest friend had kept such a huge secret from him for so long\u2026 </p>\n<p>There was no faking what Rhodey had seen in the living room.</p>\n<p>Tony Stark was a father.</p>\n<p>Tony woke to sunlight and a familiar set of sleeping breaths.</p>\n<p>He sighed contentedly. There was warm sun on his face and his eyes were closed. They didn\u2019t even have to open any time soonish. He\u2019d cleared his schedule months before for the Avenger\u2019s homecoming date; but all he was planning to do was lab time with Peter. They had a whole weekend to themselves, since May was busy. He\u2019d been wanting to show the boy the new nanite tech he\u2019d been working on. It would make fantastic armour. Maybe they could revamp the Spider-suit with it \u2013 give it a new name, even \u2013 what about the Iron Spider?</p>\n<p>Ha, Rhodey would laugh at him about that. </p>\n<p>But wait. Rhodey wasn\u2019t here, he was off on missions with the Avengers while Tony hid away in his tower like the fucking coward he was; unable to face his parents\u2019 brain-washed murderer and a man he\u2019d once considered a teammate\u2026 they were coming home, though, and Tony regretted saying they could but he already had and that was all in the past now.</p>\n<p><em>How did meeting them go?</em> His brain supplied encouragingly. <em>Surely it can\u2019t have been as bad as you were worrying?</em></p>\n<p>Wait. That was a good question. Tony wracked through his jumbled thoughts, but for the life of him he couldn\u2019t remember meeting the Avengers last night.</p>\n<p>What he did remember (with a sinking feeling) was Peter\u2019s backpack spontaneously combusting and smashing the penthouse TV. Turns out the boy had somehow contaminated his school books with a variety of chemicals from the lab and also a poison-tipped knife some mugger had almost stabbed him with. The kid had an alarming penchant for getting into scrapes. </p>\n<p>He was going to turn Tony\u2019s hair grey one day. It was lucky neither of them were in the room at the time. </p>\n<p>Tony had, of course, said everything was fine (except for how the hell did this kid get his backpack to explode). He could always buy another TV but in the meantime, they could go downstairs to the Avengers floor, where there was another TV.</p>\n<p>So they did, and Peter fell asleep halfway through the movie and then Tony supposed he did too, which meant\u2014</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t met the Avengers last night.</p>\n<p>Double fuck.</p>\n<p>It felt a bit like two parallel lines had crossed \u2013 one world where Tony had the Avengers and one where Tony had Peter. How the hell had two schedules collided so abysmally? </p>\n<p>He\u2019d been thinking about this weekend in <em>two separate contexts</em> for <em>months</em>.</p>\n<p>God, he was an idiot. He\u2019d fallen asleep in the Avenger\u2019s fucking living room.</p>\n<p>So had Peter.</p>\n<p>Tony was trying to protect Peter. Not push him into the spotlight to be judged. Oh, he\u2019d royally screwed up.</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>Yep. The Avenger\u2019s living room.</p>\n<p>Tony looked down at Peter, who\u2019d somehow wriggled into the crook of his arm. The kid\u2019s breaths were deep and even. Tony really didn\u2019t want to wake him up, but he couldn\u2019t just leave him here for the Avengers to find and obsess over.</p>\n<p>God, that would be a disaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d he murmured, running a thumb along his arm. \u201cPete, buddy, wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmph,\u201d the kid said sleepily. </p>\n<p>Tony hid a smile. \u201cPeter, you gotta get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh crap. Hadn\u2019t thought this through very well, had he? \u201cWell. Uh. You want some breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Sit morning yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, buddy, it\u2019s morning. Or maybe noon, eyeing that sunshine. How \u2018bout you go back upstairs and have a shower while I get some food going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm sleepy,\u201d Peter grumbled adorably.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d <em>Please just go upstairs before they find you. Please, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do; don\u2019t know what they\u2019d do, I don\u2019t trust them anymore\u2014</em> \u201cC\u2019mon, buddy.\u201d He sat up and rubbed his neck. \u201cYou gave me a stiff neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop falling asleep on the couch, then,\u201d Peter replied, yawning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d try, but there\u2019s this annoying Spider-kid that seems to like falling asleep on me. Terrible, y\u2019know? But what can I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr <em>Stark</em>,\u201d Peter protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo have a shower,\u201d Tony replied. \u201cLab day, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>The kid perked up a lot and raced towards the elevator. As the doors closed Tony let go of a breath he hadn\u2019t realised he\u2019d been holding. Now, to get out of here himself without being seen\u2026</p>\n<p>That plan didn\u2019t last long. Tony turned around, still wearing a hoodie, trackpants, and socks, with the couch blanket wrapped around his shoulders and looking (if he did say so himself) almost disgustingly domestic; opened the door, and was met with a waiting circle of not-very-happy Avengers.</p>\n<p>Boom. Ambushed. </p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s heart sank right down into his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Clint snarked. \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting you to wake up anytime soon. Looked like you needed the sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>. They\u2019d seen him. Had they seen Peter?</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he tried, \u201cmy tower, my rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you were going to come and say hello, Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said <em>maybe</em> I would. I was- uh, working in the lab?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t explain why we found you out cold in our living room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase,\u201d Natasha decided. A hush settled. \u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>They saw him.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh fuck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Uh.\u201d </p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t often Tony was lost for words. But this was one of those times.</p>\n<p>How was he supposed to describe Peter? And how was he supposed to explain what Peter meant to him, to the Avengers, who were all convinced (with the possible exception of Rhodey) he was an asshole?</p>\n<p>Peter was\u2026 Spider-Man, obviously, though he couldn\u2019t tell them that. A random kid he\u2019d tracked to Queens. A genius, to make those webs that had the tensile strength to pretty much <em>hold two halves of a ferry together</em> and were so sticky Tony had spent five memorable hours holding onto a screwdriver from scratch using only whatever chemicals his science teacher wouldn\u2019t miss. The kid was possibly smarter than Tony. </p>\n<p>He was a mentee. A protegee. Somebody Tony could pass his experience to. But more than that.</p>\n<p>He was\u2014oh crap.</p>\n<p>Peter felt like Tony\u2019s <em>kid</em>.</p>\n<p>Not <em>a</em> kid.</p>\n<p><em>His</em> kid.</p>\n<p>But he wasn\u2019t, and Tony didn\u2019t have the right to parent him. To be a dad.</p>\n<p>No, they were mentor/mentee. Nothing more.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my intern,\u201d Tony said weakly.</p>\n<p>They glared at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d asked Rhodey, who looked slightly confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d Natasha snapped. \u201cI know what a lie sounds like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell the truth, Stark,\u201d Sam admonished.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d Tony struggled. \u201cStop questioning me!\u201d</p>\n<p>If only he\u2019d gotten an extra few hours of sleep. Maybe then he\u2019d have the brain capacity to leave this situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Guys?\u201d Bruce asked. They turned and looked at him. \u201cGive Tony some space. We\u2019re in his home, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s yours, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Rhodey asked quietly. \u201cYour son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony opened and closed his mouth. Like a fish. \u201cNo?\u201d </p>\n<p>A pause. Nobody looked like they believed him. \u201cNo! NO! No, he\u2019s not mine. He\u2019s an intern. Just an intern.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint blinked. \u201cExactly how dumb do you think we are?\u201d</p>\n<p>Now wasn\u2019t a good time to antagonise people. \u201cVery?\u201d Dammit, you smartass mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man turned, socks sliding over the floor. And came face-to-face with Steve.</p>\n<p>Captain fucking America.</p>\n<p>Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to say sorry,\u201d the bigger man said humbly.</p>\n<p>Tony scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really, truly sorry. Nothing can make what I did alright. Nothing ever will. But for the little it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry for lying to you. And fighting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky looked at Tony\u2014shyly?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sorry too,\u201d the other man whispered.</p>\n<p>Tony left without another word, fuming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Upstairs, he checked with FRIDAY first to ensure none of the Avengers had tried to follow him (into his very private penthouse, fuck them); which luckily none of them had. Then he asked FRIDAY to ban them from the penthouse floor.</p>\n<p>She did.</p>\n<p>Then he turned on the stovetop, and got out a frying pan, and went into something Peter knowingly called his \u201cstress cooking phase\u201d, where his body was on autopilot. Peter said some of the most interesting meals he\u2019d ever tasted were from when Tony stress-cooked. And that was saying something, because he\u2019d seen the kid gulp down a very questionable-looking biscuit a fan had baked him once. Not to mention his Aunt\u2019s cooking (if that can be labelled as such).</p>\n<p>No, Tony\u2019s stress-cooking was delicious. Delicious but a little strange.</p>\n<p>Peter came out of the shower just as Tony felt like he\u2019d woken up. The kid was wearing a new pair of pants and undoubtedly another dorky science T-shirt, but Tony couldn\u2019t see that because his own MIT jumper was in the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ever going to take that thing off, kid?\u201d he asked, amused.</p>\n<p>Peter slid onto a stool at the breakfast bench and accepted the plate Tony handed him. \u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint woke up on Monday morning with jet lag. Which he smothered in two croissants, one glass of orange juice, and a cookie.</p>\n<p>The kitchen was empty, and so was the living room. No sleeping-Tony-plus-kid combo to be seen. (Did it feel weird, now that they were gone? Surely not. Surely a snoring Tony wasn\u2019t something Clint felt should naturally be on the couch.)</p>\n<p>He thought about that as he scanned the fridge, picking up a plum thoughtfully. Tony had never seemed like the fatherly type. Always very gruff, and rude, and smug.</p>\n<p>What had he called himself?</p>\n<p>Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.</p>\n<p>No. It should have been genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist; dad.</p>\n<p>God, that was a mouthful.</p>\n<p>Clint really wanted to meet this kid. He wanted to be the cheeky uncle that took the nephew on adventures that his dad wouldn\u2019t approve of (now that Clint came to think of it, Tony would make a great helicopter parent). He wanted to introduce this kid to his own family and set up a day for them to all play together. </p>\n<p>They hadn\u2019t seen Tony since yesterday morning; when he\u2019d stormed away from Steve and Bucky\u2019s apologies \u2013 Clint couldn\u2019t exactly blame him \u2013 and gone upstairs. Of course, Natasha had tried later that day to get into the penthouse, but FRIDAY had quietly informed her that the Avengers were not welcome on the upper floors, and the AI sounded so very pleased about it that Natasha hadn\u2019t even decided to sneak past. Even FRIDAY knew that they were horrible friends.</p>\n<p>Ex-friends, now.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Tony had apparently spent all afternoon in the lab (where was the kid, then? Probably in there with him if he\u2019d inherited Tony\u2019s brains). Rhodey had gone to find Pepper partway through the afternoon, looking confused and slightly hurt, and the strange thing was Clint hadn\u2019t seen <em>him</em> since either.</p>\n<p>Maybe this was the start of a horror movie. Find a billionaire asleep on the couch and suddenly your team gets picked off one by one.</p>\n<p>Clint shook his head. Maybe it was time to go around and see if anything had changed since he\u2019d lived here before.</p>\n<p>Beside, he could really do with some spying right now. He had so many questions.</p>\n<p>Still in his pyjamas, Clint stalked out of the kitchen and down the hallway. He passed his room and Natasha\u2019s room and Steve\u2019s room that Bucky had not-so-surreptitiously moved in to. Then he got in the elevator and went down to floor 34, which was his favourite entrance to Tony\u2019s vent system.</p>\n<p>Luckily it was still there. </p>\n<p>Clint stepped out of the elevator and shuffled through a very busy office filled with very busy people doing \u2026 stuff? All he could see was rows upon rows of desks and computers and occasionally large tables and whiteboards and holographic screens. And a few pot plants.</p>\n<p>Clint realised most of the people were staring at him, and he smirked and waved a little awkwardly. These people had no business being so wide awake at nine o\u2019clock in the morning. How dare they stare at him. Just because he was a recently un-banished Rogue Avenger (Hawkeye, the best one, obviously) walking through their office looking for a vent so he could crawl inside the wall in his pyjamas didn\u2019t mean they could be all judgemental. </p>\n<p>He ignored them (mostly; he couldn\u2019t resist making a peace sign at one group of gawkers) and reached the vent, which was exactly the same as he remembered. Well, somebody had screwed it shut, but that was okay, because he came prepared.</p>\n<p>He reached inside his pyjama shirt pocket and pulled out a small screwdriver he\u2019d noticed on the coffee table upstairs. It was probably dropped by Tony. Somehow. Who carries screwdrivers around with them anyway?</p>\n<p>Genius mechanics, apparently. </p>\n<p>Or possibly genius mechanic kids.</p>\n<p>Fortunately the screwdriver mostly fit the screws, and within a few minutes Clint had the vent open and ready to go. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d one of the employees said bossily.</p>\n<p>Clint stuck one leg awkwardly inside the wall before it dawned on him he was who she was talking to. \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really supposed to go around unscrewing vent grilles,\u201d she told him. </p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowned. </p>\n<p>\u201cI used to do this all the time,\u201d he informed her. \u201cWere you working here a year or two ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. But I think that\u2019s quite beside the point\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He jumped into the dim space and crawled away as quickly as his knees would manage. Outside, the woman frowned again, and pocketed the tiny screwdriver and screws. She left the vent cover where he\u2019d put it down.</p>\n<p>Clint went up, then down, and then took two lefts. Every so often he\u2019d pass another grille, mostly in the walls of offices and quite low to the ground (\u201cSign here, please, if that\u2019s quite satisfactory\u201d; \u201cJust two milligrams, you don\u2019t want to explode, do you?\u201d) but Clint barely looked sideways because it was like muscle memory. He knew where he was going, and he knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>Eventually he reached a long conference room where Pepper was quite successfully roasting a trio of old, wrinkly men. She spread a few papers out on the table and gestured to five highlighted spots, smiling as she did so.</p>\n<p>Clint listened for a moment, fiddling with his hearing aids, but the only useful thing he heard was, \u201cYes, Tony will be here, but he\u2019s not due to arrive for another half hour. Now,\u201d and Pepper\u2019s voice trailed off into talking about marketing and budgets and other things Clint couldn\u2019t be bothered to listen to.</p>\n<p>He decided to go up a floor and found a small room where Tony was shifting through a stack of papers. </p>\n<p>Clint settled down comfortably on his belly (his pyjamas were going to need a serious wash after this) and peered through the vent, which this time was in a corner of the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Tony was predictably grumbling. \u201cCan\u2019t these just be uploaded or shit,\u201d he grouched, \u201cI swear the pile\u2019s getting larger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint pulled another cookie out from where he\u2019d stuffed it \u2018for later\u2019 in the pyjama pocket. </p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s phone rang. </p>\n<p>He scrunched up his eyebrows and picked up the call. \u201cKid, why are you calling me in the middle of the day? There\u2019s this little thing called school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint fished his phone out and positioned it on the grille of the vent, pressing record stealthily. Then took a bite of his cookie.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I am very aware that recess exists, but you can\u2019t pull that one on me, okay? The bell doesn\u2019t ring for another\u2014\u201d he checked his watch. \u201cSixteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sighed. \u201cAre you skipping class again? C\u2019mon kid, you\u2019ve got to stop doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man huffed and swept all the papers off the desk in one fluid motion. \u201cI get it that you know the syllabus and whatnot already, I believe you, kiddo. You\u2019ve been ahead in physics since pretty much forever. I know that. But you can\u2019t keep skipping.\u201d He rubbed his head slightly and transferred the phone to the other ear. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, absolutely not. Karen\u2019ll tell me if you try anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stood up. \u201cJust go back to class. Have a boring day, and then sit with Ted and scary Michelle at lunch, and then get picked up by Happy and we\u2019ll do something in the lab tonight to make up for it. Sound good? I\u2019ll ring May, she\u2019ll be fine with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. Why do you think I went to MIT early?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, okay, yes, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, kid, surely it can\u2019t be that bad? Did you bring lunch? I know how hungry you get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told Happy! And Pepper!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, that\u2019s not enough. Still got those granola bars in your locker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell use them, buddy, this is an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, not that kind of emergency, but eating is still important. We can refill your stock whenever. Literally. So just eat them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re there for!\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint finished his cookie. This phone call was a goldmine. He was enjoying every second.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said. \u201cBye.\u201d</p>\n<p>He put the phone down.</p>\n<p>Clint leant forward to end the recording, but now that Tony was finished talking the quiet \u2018beep!\u2019 the phone made was highly audible.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d he whispered, and quickly sent the video off to the Rogue Avengers\u2019 group chat, with the caption, \u2018Proof Stark has a son\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cClint,\u201d the man growled from below. \u201cI know you\u2019re up there. Get down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>A reply shot up from Natasha. <em>Huh. I\u2019m surprised you got that without being caught.</em></p>\n<p><em>I wouldn\u2019t speak so soon</em>, he sent. And crashed through the vent into the office below.</p>\n<p>\u201cBarton,\u201d Tony grumbled. \u201cDo you know what the word privacy means?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, not really,\u201d Clint admitted, struggling up from his position on the floor surrounded by dust, a vent grille, and a few dodgy screws, and two chairs knocked onto their sides. He figured he must look a mess with dirt all over his pyjamas, so he wiped his hands over them to fix it but left a few dark handprints and a smudge of something on the pants. He shrugged.</p>\n<p>The group chat dinged. He glanced at his phone screen.</p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>Not the vents again, Clint.</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>He\u2019s so paternal.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI invite you into my home, and you spy on me?\u201d Tony asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t cut it, Barton.\u201d</p>\n<p>The group chat was fizzing with replies. </p>\n<p>Sam: <em>Sounds like the kid\u2019s got some interesting friends. Who names their child Ted?</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>Playschool fans?</em> </p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>Or, bears, I guess? Seems like a bear name.</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>Ha! But we all know Tony\u2019s going to be the mama bear here.</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>I\u2019m more concerned about \u201cscary Michelle\u201d.</em></p>\n<p>Natasha: <em>Sounds like a mini-Pepper.</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>Who do you think are Karen and May?</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>Who is the kid\u2019s mother?</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>Rhodey would probably know.</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>Colonel Rhodes?</em></p>\n<p>Natasha: <em>Rhodey?</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>Rhodey, where are you?</em></p>\n<p>Clint went back to the video. \u201cEvidence,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cTony, you\u2019ve got a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sort of thing should be illegal,\u201d Tony replied, but he wasn\u2019t denying it like yesterday. He rubbed his face tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Clint prompted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot saying,\u201d Tony answered. </p>\n<p>\u201cAge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about his mother? One of your one-night stands? Can\u2019t be Pepper\u2019s, surely?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint must have crossed the line, because Tony started yelling. \u201cNone of your fucking business, Barton! I told you already he wasn\u2019t mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Clint gestured to the video, where a tinny copy of Tony\u2019s voice was saying, \u201cAre you skipping class again? C\u2019mon, kid, you\u2019ve got to stop doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know how it looks,\u201d real-life-Tony said wearily. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d he looked uncomfortable. \u201cHe\u2019s my, uh, intern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last night,\u201d Clint replied. \u201cDo you watch movies on a Saturday night with all your other interns?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s like, my personal, uh, intern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, usually you\u2019re such a good liar. You\u2019re slipping up, man. You don\u2019t <em>have</em> personal interns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint didn\u2019t believe a word. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d He thought for a second. \u201cHey, when I meet your son, can I introduce him to my family? Cooper and Lila will love him, I bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s face made Clint nervous that he might be about to die, but then the man just sighed and sat down. \u201cMaybe one day. He\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint sent one more text to the group chat; <em>Tony\u2019s sticking to the intern story</em>, and then changed the name from <em>We\u2019re criminals now I guess</em> to <em>Let\u2019s meet Tony\u2019s son</em>.</p>\n<p>Natasha wrote back: <em>I wonder if Spider-Man has anything to do with this.</em> </p>\n<p>Tony said, \u201cyou want some lunch, Barton?\u201d and thankfully oblivious to the Rogue\u2019s suspicions, ordered them both shawarma.</p>\n<p>Sam was just about to bite into his fourth slice of pizza when the alarm blared.</p>\n<p>\u201cAvengers!\u201d Steve shouted magnificently, then looked at the room, which was pointedly ignoring him, and trailed off uncertainly. \u201c\u2026Assemble?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony got to his feet (really, Sam was shocked he\u2019d even decided to sit down and eat takeout with his ex-teammates, one parent-killing-former-assassin, and a friend who\u2019d almost killed him; but it was his funeral after all) and strode out of the room.</p>\n<p>They all scrambled into their gear and shuffled after him guiltily, Steve bringing up the rear with a miserable expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut my pizza?\u201d Sam asked.</p>\n<p>Nobody answered. </p>\n<p>Sam found it hard to face Tony Stark these days. Sure, he was the Falcon, and a tough Bucky-teasing superhero, but he could admit he had a soft spot deep inside his core that was growing \u2013 after Civil War, <em>increasingly</em> \u2013 concerned about the feelings of others.</p>\n<p>Stark was mad. Sad. Probably frustrated. And possibly lonely? Very definitely emotionally injured, and not yet healed, judging by the defensiveness of his manner nowadays. </p>\n<p>And Steve (who Clint had apparently heard talking to Bucky yesterday from inside the vents; don\u2019t ask Sam why Clint thought telling him was a good idea \u2013 <em>us bird-themed heroes better stick together, man</em> \u2013 Clint was mad, crawling around in the ceiling eavesdropping like that) was all the above minus some of the emotional battering, and plus a giant chunk of guilt, which Sam would personally recommend seeing a therapist about. </p>\n<p>Hmm. Maybe one day he should kidnap them all and send them to a giant therapy session. Sam stifled a smirk as he imagined how well <em>that</em> would turn out.</p>\n<p>But anyway, they were done sitting in a swamp of almost visible tension eating pizza and ignoring said tension because apparently there was a mission downtown. Another wormhole and some Doombots. Just another Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The first Sam saw of the battle ground was a big purple smear across the sky, like somebody had tried to paint some fancy art but then wiped it by accident while it was still wet. It was just hovering, or floating, suspended by nothing, folded in on itself like an optical illusion in a way that made Sam\u2019s brain hurt just by looking at it. Strings of Doombots were pouring out of it, and when Sam swooped in too close, he started to vibrate like a fucking harp. Which hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that purple thing?\u201d Stark directed at nobody in particular (he wasn\u2019t to know it then, but he\u2019d find out eventually that purple was really <em>not</em> his colour). </p>\n<p>They all tried to look at it without actually looking at it. Sam\u2019s head throbbed. </p>\n<p>\u201cPortal?\u201d Rhodey replied when none of the others dared to say a word. They all were a little scared, Sam thought, subconsciously seeking acceptance from Tony and terribly insecure because they didn\u2019t want to mess up again.</p>\n<p>Sam flared his wings and dropped lower. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomebody\u2019s gonna need ta shut it down,\u201d Bucky said over the comms. \u201cStevie, get ya fucking ass over here and help.\u201d</p>\n<p>It looked like some of the Doombots had already been disposed of. They were missing metal limbs or had bent plates or were sparking with electricity, but most were stuck to the ground, or the walls, and covered in white stringy stuff.</p>\n<p>Sam flew through something sticky and flailed around in the air for a second before righting himself. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he spluttered. He recognised the feeling, but; \u201ca spiderweb? What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you say spiderweb?\u201d Stark barked. \u201cAh, jeez, please tell me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d a new voice squeaked over their private comms. (How the fuck had somebody hacked Stark\u2019s fancy tech? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be unhackable?) \u201cIt\u2019s the Avengers! Oh my god, it\u2019s the Avengers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stark groaned. \u201cHey, spider-kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Spider-Man, <em>how many times do I have to tell you</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, spider-baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-<em>Man</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpiderling,\u201d Stark countered, with just a hint of a smile in his voice. This sounded like a common argument. There was no other response, but Sam could tell everybody had their confused faces on.</p>\n<p>Silently and without warning, the portal collapsed in on itself with a horrible jarring flash. The endless arrival of Doombots stuttered to a stop. \u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said through comms, \u201cwe\u2019ve got the purple thing closed. Now we just have to defeat all the robots before they hurt anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d the new voice said confidentially, presumably to Stark (and amusingly ignoring Steve, who was trying to battle-plan in the background), \u201cand I promise I didn\u2019t go looking for\u2014\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cKid. You are a <em>magnet</em> for trouble. Seriously. You don\u2019t even need to go looking for it. Your- <em>you know who</em> is going to <em>kill me</em>. You are an absolute dumpster fire of a person. Human disaster. Accident-attraction supreme. You\u2019re giving me grey hairs,\u201d Stark hissed, his tone laced with annoyance and a bit of affection, too, if Sam was reading it right. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you, kiddo. Only you could turn a patrol into this. This is Avengers stuff, y\u2019know? Not quite at your level. This is a big step up from rescuing cats in trees,\u201d Stark pointed out. \u201cWhy were you trying to <em>take this on alone</em>!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on, I was going really well! No hits! And I don\u2019t just save cats from trees. I also save people!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom trees?\u201d Stark smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You know what I mean!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou help old ladies cross the street.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha interjected before Stark could be webbed down by a frustrated enhanced teenager. \u201cSo, you\u2019re Spider-man.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice squeaked again and rose an octave. \u201cYes, and you\u2019re MissNatashaRomanovBlackWidow. Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome again?\u201d Clint laughed. </p>\n<p>\u201cHellopleasedon\u2019tkillme,\u201d the newcomer said breathlessly. \u201cOh my god I\u2019m meeting the Avengers! My guy in the chair is going to <em>freak</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cGood to meet you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam circled around and kicked a Doombot in the chest. It tumbled backwards and Sam heard a <em>thwip-thwip</em> sound before the bot was plastered to the ground in synthetic webbing.</p>\n<p>He caught a glimpse of Spider-man then. The red-and-blue costumed vigilante was crouched halfway up the side of the wall, eyes comically widened, arms out webbing down bots without getting too close.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey, go away,\u201d Iron Man growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m helping!\u201d </p>\n<p>The vigilante sounded like a petulant toddler. How old was this guy? At the airport, Sam had assumed he was in his thirties, and then five minutes ago he\u2019d revised that to early twenties, but now the dude was sounding like he was eleven?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this covered,\u201d Tony urged. \u201cYou can go.\u201d He blasted a Doombot in the classic Iron Man pose, then made the I\u2019m-watching-you fingers at Spider-Man, who flipped him the bird.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Spidey,\u201d Rhodey called, \u201cNice to finally meet you.\u201d His voice had an undercurrent of amusement and irony that suggested he knew something they all didn\u2019t. It had to be from Pepper. What had she told him? Where had he spent all those hours on Sunday?</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Spider-Man huffed dramatically. \u201cI <em>would</em> say the same, Un- I mean, uh, Mister Rhodey, but unfortunately Iron Man has grounded me, and meanwhile I\u2019ve been <em>robbed</em> of my <em>trust</em> in him because y\u2019<em>all</em> in New York? Why didn\u2019t anybody <em>tell me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh god, Sam could <em>feel</em> him pouting without even looking. And he was wearing a mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpidey,\u201d Stark warned. \u201cGo home and do your homework or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Mister Iron Man Sir,\u201d the vigilante snarked sarcastically, and webbed down a final bot before fleeing the scene. \u201cBye, Avengers! Be nice to Iron Man!\u201d</p>\n<p>And goddammit, if Tony Stark didn\u2019t stand there on a rooftop watching the vigilante web away, waved back to him as he swung around a corner, and shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s going to give me a heart attack one day, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Rhodey chuckled.</p>\n<p>Sam opened up a private comm with Clint, who was almost hyperventilating at Stark\u2019s behaviour. \u201cSpider-baby? Kiddo? Your <em>you-know-who</em>? Uncle Rhodey? Go home and do your homework?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck it all,\u201d Sam agreed.</p>\n<p>They wrapped the rest of the Doombots up quickly. It was awkward to be standing together post-battle again, all slightly exhausted and sweaty and having just fought side-by-side like <em>the good old days</em>. Stark quickly excused himself to go find, quote unquote, \u201cwhatever fucked-up tech conjured that magic portal shit,\u201d and Rhodey followed him, still smirking to himself. They saw him nudge Tony fondly as they walked away and muttered something in his ear.</p>\n<p>Sam landed and they all exchanged glances. They knew they were thinking the same thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Clint began proudly. </p>\n<p>Steve shrugged and slung his shield over his shoulder, just like he always did. \u201cI guess we found Stark\u2019s kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce was three-quarters of the way through rewriting a particularly intense nuclear physics equation on a holographic screen in his private lab in Stark Tower (courtesy of one Tony Stark) when the door whooshed familiarly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in?\u201d he murmured absently, checking back to see if he carried the one from the last sub-equation. He had. </p>\n<p>The door to the lab slid mechanically open, to reveal a genius-billionaire-playboy-pilanthropist-<em>possibly-dad</em> according to the team\u2019s conspiracy theories; and a slender, surprised-faced teen with brown curls standing awkwardly half-behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Tony Stark said, derailing Bruce\u2019s train of thought, which promptly was engulfed in flames and then exploded for good measure. Bruce couldn\u2019t even remember what he was thinking about.</p>\n<p>Why was there a child in his lab?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou distracted me,\u201d he frowned mildly. \u201cTony, who is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Tony, a tad sheepishly, \u201cI thought- you didn\u2019t come to the last team mission yesterday, Brucie, and I thought I might as well bring my very favourite intern up to say hello to his idol.\u201d He tugged his collar. \u201cSeriously, he\u2019s been yapping my jaw off about you. You\u2019re on his school\u2019s hero wall, or something of the sort. Nah, but I still reckon I\u2019m his favourite Avenger. Anyway, that\u2019s not important. Well, it is, but I\u2019m sure it can take a backseat for the minute, we can sort out blatant and completely unjust favouritism later. Anyway.\u201d Tony took a breath and spread his arms. \u201cBrucie. Meet Peter Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looked at Peter Parker, whose eyes were so wide and speechless that he might as well be a bit comatose.</p>\n<p>Peter Parker looked back at Bruce.</p>\n<p>Then the floodgates broke.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmygodyou\u2019reDoctorRobertBruceBanner,\u201d the teenager gasped, \u201cthegreatestscientistofourgeneration.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Bruce was struggling to decipher what the boy had said, Tony Stark rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat about <em>me</em>?\u201d he complained good-naturedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mister Stark,\u201d Peter assured the man with a sly grin, \u201cyou\u2019re oh-so-important. But <em>oh my god</em>, you\u2019re Doctor <em>Robert Bruce Banner</em>, sir, I\u2019ve read your papers on nuclear physics, <em>is that your famous equation on the board, sir</em>, I\u2019m a major fan of your work, it\u2019s groundbreaking, unbelievable, you\u2019ve got seven PHDs, sir, SEVEN, oh my god, did you know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce was blown away. This sparkly-eyed kid was looking at him as if he was the greatest human being that ever lived, all dreamlike and excited. Stark put a hand on the kid\u2019s back, and murmured, \u201cdon\u2019t forget to breathe, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t worthy of all that praise, right? </p>\n<p>Though he was naturally taken aback with the sheer adoration the teen was exuding, Tony Stark twinkled at him knowingly. Bruce decided to claim the kid\u2019s hero worship, albeit shyly. He offered Peter a happy smile.</p>\n<p>This was something entirely new. People only ever looked at the Hulk like that; and only after particularly impressive displays of brawn, smashing lots of enemies, bringing victories to the team. This boy thought <em>Bruce Banner</em> was all that. Not Hulk, but Bruce.</p>\n<p>A great deal of warmth softened his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI did know that, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blushed. \u201cSorry, sir, I mean, obviously, you\u2019d know how many PHDs you\u2019d have, you were the one to study for all of them, I was just so excited, too excited probably\u2026 Mister Stark had to remind me to breathe five times in the elevator, it was crazy, I was almost hyperventilating, but oh my god you\u2019re Bruce Banner!\u201d</p>\n<p>Back to square one, Bruce supposed. \u201cHi Peter,\u201d he tried. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet one of Tony\u2019s interns. Would you like to call me Bruce?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened <em>even more</em> (surely, that was impossible. Apparently not) and nodded carefully, like he thought that moving his head too rapidly would cause it to fall off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, if you\u2019re really okay with that, Dr Ro- Bruce, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need for the \u2018sir\u2019, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teen nodded enthusiastically. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d Tony said. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just leave you to whatever nerd stuff you were doing? Have fun, Brucie, Peter\u2019s a clever kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned back to the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Mister Stark!\u201d Peter bellowed after him.</p>\n<p>Bruce caught a smirk as the door closed. \u201cSo, Peter,\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat work do you do with Tony?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy turned bright red. \u201cUhm, w-we, I, um, I usually just, uh, tinker? Like, Mister Stark sometimes goes all,\u201d he put on a very bad impression of Tony, \"\u201cPete, kiddo, look at this\u201d and then at others times, he\u2019s like, \u201cpass me the screwdriver- no, sorry, I need a soldering iron\u201d and then I\u2019m like, \u201cbut Mister Stark how do you mistake a soldering iron for a screwdriver\u201d and he\u2019s all gruff and \u201cshut up Pete we can\u2019t all be as geniuses\u201d but then, I say, \u201cyou literally ARE a genius, Mister Stark\u201d and then he gets grumpy \u2018cause I\u2019m full of teenage sass, apparently, and anyway I don\u2019t know that much about the Iron Man suits anyway \u2018cause every time we really get into pulling them apart either DUM-E blows something up, which is kinda proving what I was saying to Mister Stark before, about how DUM-E\u2019s got even worse luck than me \u2013 he doesn\u2019t believe me, but I reckon it\u2019s definitely true \u2013 or Pepper always comes \u2018cause she gets worried when we\u2019re in the lab for like twelve plus hours at a time and then usually we get sidetracked watching a movie or\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce blinked at the verbal vomit that had exploded from the boy, but after listening to it for a moment a smile crept back onto his face. </p>\n<p>Also, this kid? Was <em>way</em> too close to Tony to be just an intern. And handing him things? Something Tony didn\u2019t let anybody do. Not even Bruce.</p>\n<p>I mean, Bruce theorised, spending more than twelve hours in Tony\u2019s personal lab at a time? Could only happen if the kid\u2019s parents were either out of the picture or completely involved, and probably even then only if the kid was living part-time in the Tower.</p>\n<p>Also, watching a movie? Not an intern activity. </p>\n<p>Calling the indomitable Pepper Potts by her first name? Also not something a mere <em>intern</em> could do without dismemberment. Just not possible.</p>\n<p>And the hair. Brown curls. The one defining feature that the team had catalogued on that fateful morning they\u2019d stumbled into the tower, jet-lagged and shocked with the greeting of a sleeping Tony Stark.</p>\n<p>Okay, but apparently the rest of the Avengers were convinced that <em>Spider-Man</em> was Stark\u2019s kid.</p>\n<p>Bruce wasn\u2019t quite sure how that would work. He\u2019d never met the Queens\u2019 vigilante, but then, that was proof against that theory, wasn\u2019t it? And a vigilante operating solely in Queens couldn\u2019t live in the Tower with Tony and Pepper, and would they let their child swing around the streets stopping muggings and catching cars in spandex?</p>\n<p>Hmm. Nope.</p>\n<p>Bruce shook his head, and three hours later, after Peter left, flushed and happy after an afternoon with his idol (honestly, Bruce couldn\u2019t remember the last time he too had felt more appreciated and able to just <em>talk about his work</em> with people actually <em>following along</em>); he opened the group chat.</p>\n<p><em>My bet\u2019s on Tony\u2019s intern</em>, he typed.</p>\n<p><em>But Spidey!</em> Clint replied quickly.</p>\n<p>Steve: <em>What makes you think that?</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>It\u2019s definitely spidey</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>that spider brat for sure</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>you\u2019re still salty you flew right through his webs</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>it was creepy! Spiders freak me out</em></p>\n<p>Rhodey: <em>true, spiders are weird</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>too many legs</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>Anyway, let\u2019s get back on topic.</em></p>\n<p>Clint: <em>the intern thing was a cover, remember, Bruce? Stark was clearly lying</em></p>\n<p>Bruce typed one more message, <em>but I met the intern today. Can\u2019t entirely be a cover cause the intern\u2019s real. Tony actually has a personal intern</em>; and pondered on the mystery.</p>\n<p>He noticed Natasha hadn\u2019t replied to any of the messages.</p>\n<p>Pepper was glaring at her husband.</p>\n<p>She found herself doing this a lot during board meetings. It was frustrating, keeping tabs on the presentations and discussions and potential decisions while simultaneously sending telepathic messages that screamed <em>Tony, get off your phone</em>.</p>\n<p>But, she supposed, that was yet another one of life\u2019s constants that wouldn\u2019t ever change. And could she smash one of life\u2019s constants?</p>\n<p>It was an uphill struggle, but she liked to think she made progress. At least Tony mostly turned up to the meetings nowadays.</p>\n<p>He looked every bit the overgrown high schooler \u2013 albeit a genius, billionaire one \u2013 sitting in the metaphorical back row, staring at his crotch that was illuminated faintly blue by the latest StarkPhone. He was probably texting the kid.</p>\n<p>Pepper watched him as he smiled, and she decided to let her own fond smile show too. Peter was a good influence on Tony (except perhaps with his attendance in board meetings). On Sunday, she\u2019d found Rhodey, and brought him to meet the kid, and the other man had agreed that Tony was a total dad \u2013 even if the teen wasn\u2019t biologically his own.</p>\n<p>Rhodey had kept her updated with screenshots of the Avengers\u2019 group chat, that she had yet to show her husband. The confusion and wild theorising the former rogues got up to made her laugh, but she knew Tony would probably just scoff. He was still feeling tension towards Rogers and Barnes, and no wonder: they\u2019d seriously hurt him in Siberia.</p>\n<p>They were getting vaguely close: yes, Queens\u2019 beloved neighbourhood vigilante was for all intents and purposes Iron Man\u2019s son, but what they were failing to realise was that Peter Parker, Tony\u2019s teenage intern, was the man behind the mask.</p>\n<p>Her own phone pinged and she smiled a wordless <em>excuse me, please</em> as she picked it up. Rhodey wanted to know whether the Rogue Avengers could sit in on the meeting. Apparently they were bored (a common affliction for superheroes, apparently) and driving him insane.</p>\n<p>She sighed. The board members had just moved on to arguing the merits of having \u201cunjustly pardoned outlaws\u201d living fifty floors above them, in the same building as hundreds of Stark Industries employees. Whether that contributed to a good or bad street reputation was highly controversial, though, as half of the discussion\u2019s participants thought that the heroes were a danger themselves, and the other half a shield against worst things.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was better that the Rogues didn\u2019t sit in on this particular board meeting.</p>\n<p><em>Not a good time</em>, she replied. <em>Send them to the gym instead. They can work off their funk there.</em></p>\n<p><em>Too late</em>, Rhodey texted back immediately with a cheeky emoji. <em>They\u2019re on their way down now. Have fun!</em></p>\n<p><em>If this meeting goes to shit</em>, she threatened, slightly put out, <em>you\u2019ll be in for a world of trouble later.</em></p>\n<p>He sent back another smile, and a small, genuine, <em>sorry.</em></p>\n<p>Pepper looked over to Tony, who had a thunderstruck expression of horror on his face. She followed his gaze to the glass wall of the conference room, where lined up in the hallway and peering nervously inside were Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson. </p>\n<p>Steve knocked politely on the door, which was redundant since by this time everybody in the room was staring.</p>\n<p>Pepper thought she died a little inside. This probably wasn\u2019t going to go well.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, excuse me, ma\u2019ams, sirs,\u201d he poked his head in the door, \u201cwe were told we could witness this board meeting?\u201d</p>\n<p>They filed in and plopped themselves in the empty seats lining the walls. Tony stilled and threw Pepper a questioning glance and she texted him surreptitiously, <em>You\u2019ve got Rhodey to thank for this. Apparently his patience was running low upstairs.</em></p>\n<p>Pepper glanced at the Avengers, trying her best to stay seemingly attentive to whatever blustered conversation was taking place, and noticed they were all gazing with varying degrees of secrecy at Tony, who had returned to texting on his phone.</p>\n<p>Rhodey sent her another screenshot of the group chat and she read through it with a hand raised over her mouth, thinking she might combust with the effort of holding her laughter in.</p>\n<p>Clint: <em>ooh, look, he\u2019s texting someone. who d\u2019you reckon it is?</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>can\u2019t be Pepper. She\u2019s not on her phone and he\u2019s texting too quick for somebody not to be replying</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>So you think it\u2019s his son?</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>hang on hang on</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>it could be literally anybody</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>it\u2019s probably Rhodey</em></p>\n<p>Natasha: <em>it\u2019s not Rhodey.</em> </p>\n<p>Clint: <em>how do you know that</em></p>\n<p>Natasha: <em>it was Rhodey who sent us down here, but when we entered the room Tony stopped texting to look at Pepper in confusion. </em></p>\n<p>Natasha: <em>he knew Rhodey was upstairs with us, so if he had been texting Rhodey he would have just asked him what was going on, rather than looking to Pepper for an explanation</em></p>\n<p>Clint: <em>oh</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>yeah that makes sense</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>what if its his intern though?</em></p>\n<p>Clint: <em>who would bother to ignore Pepper\u2019s murder-stares to text an intern? who probably only fetches him an endless stream of coffee or something?</em></p>\n<p>Clint: <em>definitely his son</em></p>\n<p>Bruce: <em>but what if the intern is the son</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>you said the intern called him Mister Stark tho</em></p>\n<p>Steve: <em>I thought we\u2019d agreed his son was Spiderman?</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>hey hey</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>apparently there\u2019s a hyphen</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>who the fuck told you that</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>spidey</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>when have you talked to him outside battle!?</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>I didn\u2019t. this was during battle</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>why\u2019d you write his name down during a fight</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>I didn\u2019t</em></p>\n<p>Bucky: <em>he just said he could tell I was saying it without the hyphen apparently</em></p>\n<p>Sam: <em>what the fuck</em></p>\n<p>Clint: <em>definitely related to Stark</em></p>\n<p>Pepper put her phone down and turned her attention back to the board members.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much left to say,\u201d she offered, flicking to the last pages of her itinerary, eager to wrap this up as quickly and smoothly and possible before any damage control was needed. \u201cA reminder that our new school-centric field trip program will be running every Friday beginning tomorrow, the relevant schools at the top of the waiting list have been notified and provided with the details prior to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper found herself cut off by a familiar whirring sound and the smashing of a glass window. She looked up reflexively, frowning, but it wasn\u2019t the former rogues that had caused the trouble this time: an Iron Man suit stood just inside the room, casting unfiltered sunlight onto the carpet, surrounded by shards of glass. Tony was already racing for the suit, his watch flashing distinctive red and blue.</p>\n<p>The armour closed around him amid shouts of confusion and annoyance from the board members, and Iron Man blasted away.</p>\n<p>The Avengers exchanged glances while Pepper calmed the room. Strange to say it was not the first time her husband had spontaneously left a board meeting, however, that was his most dramatic exit yet. </p>\n<p>Bucky raised his hand. \u201cMs Potts?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighed. \u201cYes, Barnes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d he asked politely.</p>\n<p>Steve hissed at his boyfriend. Pepper strode over to Tony\u2019s abandoned phone, left open, and read the notification at the top of the screen. </p>\n<p>She sighed again. \u201cTony received an alert that Spider-Man had been stabbed,\u201d she told the room. </p>\n<p>Mutterings rose up. Pepper might not have had enhanced hearing, but the Avengers\u2019 whispers were loud and crystal clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cOverprotective, much?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the- Stark has an alert set-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s monitoring Spidey\u2019s vitals? What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-is that not dad behaviour-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, Spider-Man was stabbed? Of course he was. Have you even ever seen the news?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Steve said with a note of finality. \u201cSpidey is definitely Stark\u2019s son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo doubt about it,\u201d Clint agreed.</p>\n<p>Pepper hid an exasperated smile. Natasha caught the CEO\u2019s eye and lifted a single eyebrow knowingly. </p>\n<p>The meeting lasted two more awkward minutes until Pepper ushered everybody out of the room and told them she\u2019d talk to them later.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s death was imminent. Contrary to his all of his (enhanced but admittedly unreliable) survival instincts he\u2019d just handed his signed field trip permission slip back to his teacher.</p>\n<p>Ned didn\u2019t seem to get it. \u201cPeter,\u201d he hissed as the class began trudging outside to the waiting school bus. \u201cThis is going to be the literal best day ever in the entire existence of humankind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure billions of people dying all over the world right now agree with you,\u201d MJ commented drily, appearing beside them with her nose in a book. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Peter groaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you ten minutes ago when I was trying to think of a cunning plan to destroy my permission slip.\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ cocked her head. \u201cOh?\u201d she said pertly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at thinking up cunning plans,\u201d the boy grumbled.</p>\n<p>She raised an eyebrow fondly and made her unobtrusive way to the back seat of the bus. This was where they always sat: MJ on the left, leaning on the window, curled up around her bag with a book in a manner than Peter would never admit to anyone that he thought was really cute; Ned on the right, bag on the seat next to him and very happily invading Peter\u2019s personal space (because he knew Peter was a tactile person, and liked sitting close enough to people that their shoulders were pressed together, and Ned also liked hugs, so it worked out well for both of them), and Peter in the middle, falling into the aisle every time the bus lurched in traffic but somehow always managing to catch himself.</p>\n<p>Today, however, Peter settled into his seat with a long-suffering scowl and face-planted Ned\u2019s shoulder. \u201c\u2019M doomed,\u201d his muffled voice whined.</p>\n<p>Flash leant over the seat, blown up like a poisonous pufferfish, but before he could make a scathing remark, probably about Peter and all the wicked lies he supposedly spent school hours telling, MJ beat him to it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she deadpanned, and calmly went back to reading her book. </p>\n<p>Flash closed his mouth, but almost immediately opened it again, this time even more aggressively. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd no,\u201d MJ continued, flipping over a page of her book without looking up.</p>\n<p>He opened his mouth again. </p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>And again.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Only a few minutes after that; \u201cMm,\u201d MJ said warningly, and for the rest of the trip it only took a bored glance over her book for Flash to close his mouth and turn away, red-faced and grumbling. </p>\n<p>\u201cMJ,\u201d Ned said wonderingly, \u201cdo you think you could teach me how to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t join in the indignant dispute that followed, but by the time they all forwarded off the bus he had a glimmer of a smile on his face, and MJ had a twist to her mouth that hinted she was pretty pleased at being the one who put it there.</p>\n<p>Everyone had their faces tilted to the sky. </p>\n<p>\u201cStark Tower,\u201d Ned murmured at the glittering silver building rising gracefully into the sky. </p>\n<p>\u201cStark Tower,\u201d Peter muttered in agreement. \u201cQuick. I need a disguise.\u201d</p>\n<p>His best friends shrugged, and by the time Mr Harrington had marked the role (again) and briefed the class on being sensible, mature students, Peter was wrapped in an oversized hoodie that belonged to Ned, had his fringe artfully arranged in front of his eyes courtesy of MJ, and was slumping as best he could in a moody-teen sort of way, which, contrary to his usual eager manner, was about as effective as he could possibly hope for.</p>\n<p>In the lobby, Peter dawdling at the back of the group, the tour group handed out badges and maps. \u201cMy name is Aislie,\u201d she said cheerily, looking suspiciously energetic for a woman who by all rights should be in the very middle of her midlife crisis. \u201cWelcome to Stark Tower!\u201d</p>\n<p>She parried questions and exclamations with dexterity while simultaneously managing to explain the history of the site and the dates the Tower opened, closed, and then opened again.<br>Peter could see why she had been hired. She was seriously good at dealing with excited teenagers, and thankfully for him, if she noticed him lurking sullenly at the back of the group, she didn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is FRIDAY,\u201d Aislie said, waving a hand at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Midtown School of Science and Technology tour group,\u201d the AI answered smoothly.</p>\n<p>Peter resisted the urge to wave to one of the nearby security cameras. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll let you all through this tour-specific turnstile!\u201d Aislie continued. \u201cThe light will flash green as you pass. That means that FRIDAY has scanned you and your badge and evaluated your threat level as insignificant to the wellbeing of Stark Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wondered if she\u2019d learnt a script off by heart, or if she changed it slightly each time around. Maybe she just knew so much stuff she could look at the turnstile and spout facts. </p>\n<p>The class buzzed through the gates, the line proceeding as fast as humanly possible in anticipation for what awaited them on the other side. Peter hoped that nobody would notice that as he passed through that the light didn\u2019t flash green but stayed blank. At least FRIDAY didn\u2019t make a loud noise, or alert everyone to his status as biometric-uploaded-and-recognised like he\u2019d heard her sass once to Mister Stark.</p>\n<p>Actually, Aislie had noticed, although she passed it off as a system error since the AI hadn\u2019t sounded the alarm, and so had the red-haired receptionist, who sipped her coffee with a concealed but satisfied smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis way, class.\u201d</p>\n<p>They climbed up the floors one by one, passing all sorts of displays. The group paused briefly at a statue of the original arc reactor, except this one was blown at up least three times bigger than the original. Aislie handed out fuzzy over-photocopied worksheets and pencil stubs as she spouted facts. Flash tried to stick a piece of gum under the statue but MJ and Aislie, with impeccable timing, caught him in the middle of two sub-zero glares, and he swallowed hastily and turned away.</p>\n<p>Peter hid a snigger.</p>\n<p>So did Peter\u2019s shadow, and his spidey-sense prickled on the back of his neck, though he brushed it off as the cold (yes, he was wearing a jumper. Yes, he is an idiot).</p>\n<p>They breezed through the finance department and arrived at the Avenger\u2019s museum.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d Aislie cautioned, as all twenty-six kids made a rush for the entrance.</p>\n<p>Inside, the ceiling was high, and everything was painted white, and the room felt fashionably empty. The students scattered like ants to the different podiums and glass-covered walls. </p>\n<p>Peter, not wanting to stand out by hanging around awkwardly in the middle of the room, followed the closest of his classmates to the Iron Man display. </p>\n<p>\u201cHis middle name\u2019s Edward,\u201d said one of them thoughtfully. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you not know that?\u201d shrieked another. </p>\n<p>They all laughed, Peter awkwardly bobbing his head up and down so as not to seem wholly excluded from the group. </p>\n<p>Ned materialised from nowhere. Peter jumped, but his spidey-sense, already crawling uncomfortably, didn\u2019t do him the decency so much as to spike before his best friend arrived at his elbow to drag him away.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have an exhibit on you,\u201d he hissed in Peter\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>Peter blinks. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou KNEW?!\u201d Ned hissed as furiously as somebody trying (and failing) to be subtle could. \u201cYOU KNEW THAT YOU HAD AN EXHIBIT IN THE AVENGERS FRICKING MUSUEM AND YOU DIDN\u2019T TELL ME?! ARE YOU INSANE, PETER! THIS IS THE BEST\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked so forlorn that Ned sighed. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll be more quiet. But the Avengers\u2019 Museum, Peter, really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Queen\u2019s one and only vigilante shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of embarrassing, actually. And I, sort of forgot to tell you? I didn\u2019t not-tell you on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ned replied satisfactorily, with an added snort. \u201cYou\u2019d never do something like that, what do you take me for, Peter, an idiot? But you\u2019ve got to admit it\u2019s super fucking cool\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled the boy to a halt in front of a glass tank of Spider-Man memorabilia and spread his arms magnificently. \u201cSee?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter winced. \u201cYeah, I see\u2026\u201d he said miserably.</p>\n<p>Right, smack in the middle of the case, was the tattered, tiny onesie that Spidey had made his debut in. Peter thought he might die of embarrassment. The suit wasn\u2019t anything to be proud of, for Thor\u2019s sake, he - and everyone else to visit the museum - could plainly see even the uneven stitches where he\u2019d fixed up the fabric gashes in his legs, and painfully sewn his first logo onto the front of the suit. Even the mask was there. </p>\n<p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you were going out in <em>this</em> every night,\u201d Ned said, nose almost touching the glass. \u201cHeck, I can\u2019t believe something my best friend used to wear is in one of the most popular museums in New York.\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter brushed on of the exhibit\u2019s labels. <em>Spider-Man stitches</em>, it said, with a magnified photo of the suit\u2019s crooked seams. <em>Some heroes start from scratch, and when they\u2019ve battled their way up from nothing against unbelievable odds, and they\u2019re still kinder than you\u2019d even hope to become: that\u2019s when you know they\u2019re already the best of us all.</em></p>\n<p>It was a quote from Tony Stark.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpider-Man,\u201d said Peter with a smile. \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t believe it either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the spidey sense screamed.</p>\n<p>Peter ducked, dragging Ned down beside him, before turning around and standing back up again. There was a black-clad woman right in front of them, her hand raised as if to silently tap their shoulders before Peter had dived for the ground. \u201cHello,\u201d she said with a smile that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes, although a crease in the corner of her mouth made a slightly-impressed reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d said Peter. At least she wasn\u2019t pointing a gun at him. He had a sneaking suspicion as to her identity, and he also suspected that she might have come with thankfully non-murderous motives.</p>\n<p>Damn you, spider anxiety, he grumbled to himself, trying to force down the wave of adrenaline. Why did it always have to be so unspecific?</p>\n<p>At least it wasn\u2019t as bad as the time he jumped onto the ceiling by accident because his pencil had rolled to the very edge of the table and the back of his neck felt like a bomb was about to go off.</p>\n<p>Still.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d said Ned frigidly. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I was talking to Spider-Man,\u201d she replied, staring at Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I think you\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d Ned continued bravely and totally uselessly. \u201cThis is just Peter, he\u2019s not Spi- er\u2014\u201d He shrank under her calm silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ned,\u201d Peter said wearily. \u201cNice to meet you, Ms Black Widow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha smiled properly this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the little Stark everybody has been frantic about,\u201d she offered.</p>\n<p>Peter laughed nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you\u2019re not, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boys didn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around. Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stevie was an idiot.</p>\n<p>They were finding their rhythm again, Bucky and Steve. Steadily, softly. Verbally, emotionally, physically. Bucky rolled over in the dark and laid his arm on top of his boyfriend, who wasn\u2019t sleeping but pretending to be. He didn\u2019t want to cuddle up to Bucky in bed anymore, melancholic but adamant that the other man needed personal space. Bucky didn\u2019t like that it was true. His bed had been cold and hard and empty since the 40s, and an unexpected presence in the night could easily suffocate him, maybe even trigger a flashback \u2013 though it didn\u2019t change how much he <em>wanted Stevie close</em>.</p>\n<p>Bucky wasn\u2019t stupid. When Stevie slept, he snored lightly.</p>\n<p>It was the middle of the night, they were in Stevie\u2019s old room at the Avengers Tower, and his boyfriend was the dumbest, most insecure idiot he\u2019d ever met.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he tried casually at a low murmur, \u201cwhen are you gonna apologise? Properly, I mean. Not that golden-boy shtick you tried out when we first got here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stevie jumped. \u201cBuck,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky grumbled wordlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re laying like a fucking statue.\u201d He took a breath, puffed it out gently as a warning, and shuffled closer, the tip of his cold nose brushing the back of Stevie\u2019s neck, which was warm as always. Bucky curled his toes around Steve\u2019s foot under the covers.</p>\n<p>Steve relaxed slightly. </p>\n<p>Bucky waited through the silence for the storm to break.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow--?\u201d His voice cracked in the silence. \u201cHow do I fix it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky thought about it. And sighed. \u201cStart by saying sorry, dumbass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolled over to face him, until their noses met in the middle of the bed. Steve was warm. Toasty. Golden. Made Bucky feel less broken. </p>\n<p>There were tears in Stevie\u2019s eyes. \u201cI really messed up, Buck,\u201d he whispered thickly. \u201cI razed my relationship with Tony to the ground. I\u2014I didn\u2019t make the right choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused. \u201cI wanted you back so badly I ruined everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s metal hand stole up to cup Stevie\u2019s face. A rough thumb wiped away the shiny tears. Bucky was learning, again. Learning to be gentle. Learning to be calm. Learning how to use those hands for holding velvety fruit instead of guns. Toothbrushes instead of knives. Buttons on a toaster instead of a heavy, ticking bomb. Feeling the soft, worn edges of Stevie\u2019s hoodies instead of cold steel. Leaves and wind and umbrellas and coffee. A warmth that never left his side. There might be nightmares and screams and electricity and panic and sometimes he froze and sometimes he <em>couldn\u2019t fucking breathe</em>.</p>\n<p>But Stevie helped.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sit with you and listen. And you can apologise to Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve sniffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Bucky murmured. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Stevie grumbled stubbornly. \u201cLove you, Buck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky closed his eyes. Stevie\u2019s breathing was getting deeper and slower. He hummed from the back of his throat. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>The morning came far too soon for Bucky\u2019s liking, but Stevie made breakfast, and Bucky dropped six handfuls of berries and chocolate chips in the pan while his boyfriend wasn\u2019t looking, and the pancakes ended up as lumpy as fuck, but delicious.</p>\n<p>After a few hours Stevie went to talk to Stark.</p>\n<p>Bucky wished him luck and then hauled ass down the corridor to Nat\u2019s room. He knocked softly and wiggled the handle. She was sitting in a chair in the corner, dagger in her lap and an expression that may have suggested she had been pondering something before he came in.</p>\n<p>\u201cPatch me into Stark\u2019s workshop,\u201d Bucky demanded.</p>\n<p>Nat raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ve got surveillance on Stark?\u201d She paused. \u201cWe\u2019re here to heal the team, not spy on each other behind their backs.\u201d</p>\n<p>He eyed her, wondering if on some level the words hadn\u2019t been taken straight from an internal monologue. \u201cYou and I both know you\u2019ll never not have surveillance on everyone. Just patch me in.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hummed.</p>\n<p>\u201cStevie\u2019s gone down to apologise. I need to know how badly it goes. <em>Patch me in</em>, Natalia.\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of her lips quirked up. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d </p>\n<p>She pulled out a laptop from inside the chair\u2019s seat (an all-but-invisible seam that looked like she\u2019d probably unstitched it herself), and within minutes Bucky was staring at a grainy table leg. She dialled up the volume. \u201cThis one\u2019s only good for audio.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky winced at Stark\u2019s rendition of \u2018It\u2019s a Long Way to the Top\u2019, somehow managing to be heard even above the sacrilegiously loud music. The distinctive sound of a wheeled chair scraping across concrete buzzed through the laptop speakers, followed by a wrench (or maybe five) clattering to the floor and a muttered <em>shit</em>.</p>\n<p>Bucky frowned. Nat grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that mostly all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cNo point in planting the bug, really. Hard to be a superspy in the face of loud, bad music.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cBoss, Steve Rogers is requesting a conversation with you,\u201d</em> FRIDAY suddenly chimed through the laptop.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAck,\u201d</em> Stark replied, taken aback. <em>\u201cFri, you startled me.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cLack of spatial awareness is a sign of sleep deprivation,\u201d</em> the AI responded.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019ll have you know I had over four hours last night\u2014wait, did you just say Rogers wanted to talk to me?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCorrect. On both counts.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the delay on this?\u201d Bucky asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty-four seconds,\u201d Nat sniffed. \u201cAnd seven milliseconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s downright disgraceful, that\u2019s what. I had to go as low tech as I could so the damned AI wouldn\u2019t see me as a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cTell him to go away, then,\u201d</em> Stark replied.</p>\n<p>A pause, barely long enough for the music to kick back in before; <em>\u201cHe is informing me that he would like to apologise to you.\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, well, he tried that already, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</em> Stark snarled.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCorrect. As did Barnes. Though I am not sure that either of them had the chance to fully express their emotions before you left the room. I registered disappointment and shame on both of their faces.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Nat cast a sideways glance at Bucky. \u201cWe all have a lot to apologise for,\u201d she said lightly.</p>\n<p>Bucky turned his head back to the screen. \u201cMe and Stevie most of all.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, disappointment,\u201d</em> Stark continued bitterly. <em>\u201cIts always disappointment, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI do not believe the disappointment was directed at you, Boss.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>They heard a loud, derisive scoff.</p>\n<p>Bucky drummed his human hand on the edge of the seat. \u201cIs that really what he believes?\u201d he asked quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d FRIDAY replied, her voice coming from just behind them. </p>\n<p>Nat and Bucky jumped a mile. Bucky glanced from the laptop speakers to the corners of the ceiling. Nat physically restrained herself from slamming the laptop shut and pulling out her knife. \u201cYou asshole,\u201d she hissed at the ceiling under her breath. \u201cStop watching us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky took a large breath. \u201cFRIDAY?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, James Barnes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Are you always listening?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHow do I get out of talking to him?\u201d</em> Stark asked through the laptop. <em>\u201cFri, I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d FRIDAY said in Nat\u2019s room. Nat winced at the timing.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him what Stevie told me last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will also need Steve Roger\u2019s permission to share a private conversation with a third party,\u201d the AI said.</p>\n<p>Bucky almost growled. Instead, he just sighed. \u201cThen ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cColonel Rhodes has informed you on multiple occasions that you do not have to force yourself into threatening or vulnerable situations, but he encourages you to converse with Steve Rogers, as it may be a healthy way to resolve your emotions.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>From what it sounded like, Stark blew a raspberry. <em>\u201cWhen have I ever done anything healthy,\u201d</em> he snapped, sounded pissed off and tired. <em>\u201c\u2014Don\u2019t answer that, FRIDAY.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBoss, Barnes has asked me to pass on the following audio message. I have an accompanying one from Steve Rogers, who is standing down the hallway.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Stark sighed. </p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe first one begins as follows,\u201d</em> the AI said, and the audio changed into a shifting of bed sheets and breaths, thick with tears. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI really messed up, Buck,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice echoed. \u201cI razed my relationship with Tony to the ground. I\u2014I didn\u2019t make the right choices.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThe second clip continues,\u201d</em> FRIDAY said.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cTony?\u201d said Steve hesitantly. \u201cI get why you don\u2019t want to talk to me. That\u2019s fair. I was a jerk. I was an asshole.\u201d He paused. \u201cI really miss being friends with you. You didn\u2019t deserve that hurt; emotionally, that I just up and broke and abandoned the team because of \u2018some guy I used to know\u2019. I mean, Bucky\u2019s not really some\u2014anyway, that was a real dick move, even without the fact that I, uh.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bucky could still smell that day.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cPhysically harmed you.\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>Sweat. Blood. Tears. Smoke.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that day wasn\u2019t disappearing any time soon. Even if it wasn\u2019t one of the more definitively painful ones.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou deserve a lot better than my friendship. I\u2019m not\u2014Tony, I\u2019m not really\u2014I don\u2019t know how to say this. I won\u2019t keep hassling you if you decide you don\u2019t want anything to do with me. I get that. I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be sorry for the rest of my life. So sorry. So fucking sorry.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>There was a long silence from the laptop.</p>\n<p>Bucky bit the inside of his cheek.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cFRIDAY?\u201d</em> said Stark.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYes, Boss?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Would he let Steve in? Would he leave the conversation for another time? Would he reject Steve? </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDid I just hallucinate? Did the oh-so-mighty Captain America just use the fuck-word?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bucky barked out a soft laugh. Nat raised a hand to her mouth.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou have not displayed any signs of hallucination, Boss.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p>Maybe they\u2019d be okay.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cMaybe,\u201d</em> said Stark, almost to himself, before there was another clatter and a muffled <em>oops. \u201cSet a fifteen-minute timer, then remind me to go to the common room and have a chat. Tell him to meet me there, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s coming in my beautiful lab.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Stevie cried, later that day. Bucky joined the \u201ctalk\u201d about half an hour in, to make his own apologies, and when they were all done, feeling very drained and so much more emotionally mature (look at them, talking out their feelings like big, responsible children), they left the common room and the blonde man broke down and sobbed.</p>\n<p>Bucky thought he might be smiling, though he wasn\u2019t sure really what his face was doing, since his hands were all mixed up on his boyfriend\u2019s shoulders, holding him up. He knew the tears were of relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the support, Buck,\u201d Stevie said.</p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t he know that\u2019s what Bucky was here for?</p>\n<p>Stevie was an idiot.</p>\n<p>He laughed, then, when Bucky told him so, and pretty soon their weird crying-hug-huddle turned into a slow kiss. Gentle, like Bucky was learning. Sweet, like the future. Deep, like the favour he now owed Nat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, get a room,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Stevie laughed more.</p>\n<p>They went to their room.</p>\n<p>A few hours later, Bruce knocked. \u201cClint\u2019s organising a movie night, or something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been all in the kitchen, finishing dinner. We\u2019ll move into the common room in a minute, I just thought. Um. Should give you some notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now it was Bucky\u2019s turn to start laughing, as silently as he could. Steve cleared his throat. \u201cThanks, Bruce.\u201d</p>\n<p>An awkward cough from the other side of the door. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky laughed harder. Steve shoved him in the side, playfully, and Bucky rolled over and off the bed. There was a thump as he hit the carpet. Bruce coughed and scurried away as Bucky soundlessly cackled on the floor.</p>\n<p>Stevie grinned.</p>\n<p>The common room was unusually quiet when they entered from the hallway. The Avengers were clustered around the lounge in a standing crowd, all gaping. </p>\n<p>In the dim room, Tony Stark was asleep on the couch. Movie credits, once again, rolled on the screen, and there was a mop of brown hair leaning against the billionaire\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>Clint spluttered quietly, and then came the second surprise. Tony lifted his head and turned slightly to look at the group of watchers. \u201cSsh!\u201d he said with a wicked grin. \u201cPete\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce turned white.</p>\n<p>Steve almost couldn\u2019t believe his eyes and ears. That was Peter? Peter, as in, Tony\u2019s shy intern? The teenager that Bruce had said all along that was acting like Tony\u2019s son?</p>\n<p>Steve could\u2019ve swallowed his tongue. Why didn\u2019t they listen to Bruce? </p>\n<p>Oh, but Spider-Man. Spider-Man had them all totally convinced\u2014I mean, they\u2019d all seen the way Iron Man and the vigilante interacted, and even Rhodey\u2014</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>Steve might\u2019ve been internally combusting before, but\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>What.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He sank to the floor.</p>\n<p>So Peter was Tony\u2019s son\u2014</p>\n<p>And they all saw the way Spidey\u2014</p>\n<p>Everyone was looking at him. </p>\n<p>No, now everyone was looking at Tony\u2014</p>\n<p>Everyone was looking at Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter who was the right height, the right build\u2014</p>\n<p>Sounded like a teenager, Peter, of course he sounded like a teenager, he <em>was</em> a bloody teenager\u2014</p>\n<p>And Steve might not have heard him talk like Bruce had but he could bet\u2014</p>\n<p>He would bet\u2014</p>\n<p>He knew exactly what he sounded like\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014but unfortunately Iron Man has grounded me\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at Tony.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014And I don\u2019t just save cats from trees. I also save people\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014Sure, spider-baby\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014Oh my god I\u2019m meeting the Avengers! My guy in the chair is going to freak\u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony smiled.</p>\n<p>Natasha smiled.</p>\n<p>Steve choked.</p>\n<p>Light bulbs suddenly flickered on in every member of the team\u2019s head. Steve could almost see them. There were tears in his eyes. He made a funny noise. He wasn\u2019t sure whether it was a laughing noise or a crying noise or an oxygen-deprived noise, but Bucky looked sideways at him and he knew it too, Steve could see it in his stupidly cute eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d said Bruce, the colour coming back to his forehead. He sighed long and hard. </p>\n<p>Steve put a hand over his face and breathed deeply for a few moments. Behind his closed eyelids he could hear Sam whisper, <em>\u201cwhat?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Clint pointed at Natasha furiously. \u201cYou knew!\u201d</p>\n<p>She hummed a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoo,\u201d Tony told them firmly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding, you\u2019ll wake him up\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already awake,\u201d Peter cut in suddenly, without moving his head. </p>\n<p>Yep. That was a voice Steve recognised, holy shit. Conspiracy confirmed. </p>\n<p>Fuck. He\u2019d dropped a huge metal loading thing on a kid.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s kid, no less. </p>\n<p>There was a pause where everyone stared at each other. </p>\n<p>Steve took a step forward. \u201cIn that case,\u201d he tried for a friendly smile, \u201cit\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter squinted. \u201cMm-hm. Brooklyn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cold, but. That was fair. After all, he'd <em>dropped a fucking airport bridge</em> on him.</p>\n<p>Bucky smirked from beside him, but before Steve had a chance to clear the dawning horror from his throat and apologise, Peter continued with a follow-up sentence that really got them all confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Sam asked, \u201caren\u2019t you a Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d the kid replied. \u201cJust an intern-vigilante mess.\u201d And he closed his eyes again, flopping back onto the billionaire\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan we do introductions tomorrow?\u201d he mumbled to Tony. \u201c\u2019M sorta tired right now. Bit grumpy too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say, kid,\u201d Tony replied easily, brought a hand up to card through the head of hair resting on his shoulders, and turned to the Avengers. \u201cMister Parker here has requested to reschedule this meeting for a later date when he is achieving the goal of keeping his eyes open for more than three seconds at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMister <em>Staaark</em>,\u201d Peter grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not your kid?\u201d Sam asked. He looked like he didn\u2019t believe it. Hell, Steve didn\u2019t believe it. They had similar hair and everything. Surely they were related.</p>\n<p>Tony looked a bit awkward for a moment, and then answered with a short, \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we all thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you thought,\u201d he said, \u201cFRIDAY told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was so genuine\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you couldn\u2019t\u2019ve been faking the whole\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck are you not a father\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sheer dad vibes, Tony, the\u2014\"</p>\n<p>\u201cI called bullshit,\u201d Rhodey burst out. \u201cYou love that kid like he\u2019s yours, Tones, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. I only met him last week and even I can tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be genetically related to someone to be a parent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still awake, you know,\u201d Peter muttered, but he sounded vaguely emotional.</p>\n<p>Tony huffed quietly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to the Avengers, they never shut up.\" He paused. \"Love you, Pete.\u201d</p>"
