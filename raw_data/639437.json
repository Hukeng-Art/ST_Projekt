  "text": "<p>Stiles has always prided himself on being in the know. He\u2019s usually one of the first people to figure out what\u2019s going on when no one else has any idea, and it takes a lot to throw him off these days. Especially after nearly a decade of dealing with crazy supernatural business. So if someone were to say something particularly weird or off-putting to him, Stiles is one hundred percent certain that he\u2019d have some sort of witty, intelligent retort at the tip of his tongue, ready to go. It\u2019s sort of his thing, after all. Stiles does not get taken by surprise, he does not get easily thrown off his game, and he certainly isn\u2019t ever at a loss for words.</p>\n<p>Right now, though? Right now, Stiles is thoroughly and completely baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-- wait, we\u2019re, <i>what</i>? Dad, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>His fork stops midway between his plate and his mouth as he stares open-mouthed at his father. This is supposed to be just another Sunday morning brunch with his dad and Derek, like they\u2019ve been doing for years. It isn\u2019t supposed to be... well, whatever this is now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the Sheriff asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just said-- About me and Derek. I mean, maybe I misheard you or something, because what?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad frowns, looking at Stiles like <i>he\u2019s</i> the one who\u2019s completely lost his mind here. Which is clearly not the case. Like, at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was nothing. I was just talking to your great aunt and I mentioned to her how you and Derek are dating,\u201d the Sheriff repeats, slower this time, as if he doesn\u2019t think Stiles heard him the first time. But oh, Stiles heard him all right. Loud and clear. He just... doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. \u201cShould I not have said anything to her? I know we never talk about it, but there\u2019s no reason to keep pretending like that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s not going to judge you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles continues to gape at his dad, and for once, he thinks he might be speechless. A good five seconds pass in silence before Stiles chances a glance over at Derek, who is sitting frozen to the spot, eyes wide and mouth hanging open just slightly. It would be completely hilarious if Stiles wasn\u2019t internally freaking out about the exact same thing. Because, apparently, his father thinks that he and Derek are dating.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s forehead creases, mouth pulling down into a slight frown and he places his coffee cup down on the table. \u201cStiles, calm down. Surely you can\u2019t think I\u2019ve been that blind, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Dad, I-- we-- we\u2019re not. I mean. I don\u2019t know where you got that idea, but it\u2019s--\u201d</p>\n<p>Some flicker of confusion seems to be setting in now, as his dad\u2019s eyes dart back and forth between Stiles and Derek. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad! Derek and I,\u201d Stiles says, gesturing wildly in Derek\u2019s direction, \u201care not dating. We never have been. I don\u2019t-- I have no idea where you got that from.\u201d</p>\n<p>Much to his immense surprise, the Sheriff snorts incredulously, as if the suggestion is preposterous. \u201cOh, come on, Stiles. Don\u2019t be absurd. I\u2019ve known about you two for years and I should hope it\u2019s obvious that I support you both. You\u2019re not a 16 year old kid any more. You don\u2019t need to keep this from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Years? Stiles feels himself paling, fingers tapping out a restless pattern on the tabletop as he finally drops his fork back to his plate. It lands with a noisy clang, and the sound causes him to wince briefly. His dad thinks they\u2019ve been together for <i>years</i>? How is this even Stiles\u2019s life?</p>\n<p>Two feet over, Derek continues to sit there in stony, stunned silence, and Stiles would actually really appreciate if he would decide to contribute to this conversation some time, say, this century. So, he kicks Derek\u2019s foot, hard, under the table. He manages to somehow bang his knee against the top of the table in the process, shaking the entire thing, and wow, great job at subtlety there, Stiles. But it seems to be enough to snap Derek out of it, as his head jerks around to glare at Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome help would be nice,\u201d Stiles bites out.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Derek turns to face the Sheriff, eyes still wide as he meets Stiles\u2019s dad\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat Stiles said. We\u2019re, uh. Not dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wow, that was helpful. Stiles rolls his eyes as he tries to sort out how this misunderstanding even happened in the first place. Derek glances down at the kitchen table awkwardly.</p>\n<p>For the first time, the Sheriff\u2019s expression falters, and he looks genuinely confused now. \u201cAre you guys seriously trying to tell me that you\u2019re not dating?\u201d he asks with that same incredulousness that Stiles just does not understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Stiles says, voice squeaking, but just barely. It probably wasn\u2019t even noticeable.</p>\n<p>His dad continues to stare, blinking several times before he says, carefully, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense. You two have been living together for almost two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which, right. It\u2019s just a short-term arrangement, though. Or, well, it was originally supposed to be, anyway. Stiles was fresh out of college, but wasn\u2019t quite financially stable enough to branch out on his own just yet. But considering he was in his twenties already, and he\u2019d finally had a taste of freedom, living at home seemed lame in comparison. When Derek had offered him a place to stay in the renovated Hale house for a few months, he\u2019d jumped on the chance. </p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t that he intended on staying for nearly two years. It\u2019s just... they\u2019d come a long way since Stiles was in high school, and living with Derek was so -- and he legitimately never thought he\u2019d say this, ever, but -- easy. It worked well for both of them, especially when supernatural shit went down, which wasn\u2019t nearly as frequently as it used to be, thank god. Eventually, Stiles stopped looking for another place, and Derek didn\u2019t seem to mind, and somehow a few months turned into nearly two years. But, like, that didn\u2019t mean they were involved.</p>\n<p>Of course, he doesn\u2019t say any of that. What he says instead is, \u201cWe\u2019re just roommates,\u201d then cringes, because they\u2019re so much more than that. \u201cOkay, not just roommates. We\u2019re good friends. Really good friends.\u201d (Scott will always be his best bro for life, but it\u2019s entirely possible that Derek is his closest friend these days. The strangest part is how not weird it actually is.) \u201cBut, like, friends can live together, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that. But what about Scott and Allison\u2019s wedding? Or cousin Grace\u2019s wedding last year? And Aunt Marie\u2019s remarriage? Our family reunion a few months ago?\u201d The Sheriff gestures between the two of them with a significant look on his face. </p>\n<p>Stiles glances over at Derek who lifts a single shoulder and gives him a confused look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were each other\u2019s \u2018plus one\u2019 for all of those things,\u201d Stiles\u2019s dad says. He\u2019s entirely abandoned his coffee now, mug pushed off to the side of the table. Breakfast too, by the looks of it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you two at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Stiles can even think of anything to say, he continues talking. \u201cWhat about how you two touch each other all the time? Derek\u2019s constantly wrapped around you like a scarf or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is absolutely, positively not going to blush. He\u2019s not. He refuses. Because, um, his dad might have a bit of a point there. Maybe. Like how Derek always touches him -- on the arm or the shoulder or on his neck or even his back when they\u2019re walking somewhere. Or, like, sometimes Stiles will fall asleep in Derek\u2019s bed if they\u2019re up late watching movies (because he has the bigger and better flatscreen in his room), and in the morning he\u2019ll wake up either wrapped around Derek or vice versa. They\u2019ve never talked about it, but it\u2019s happened more times than Stiles can count, and if he\u2019s being honest with himself, he likes it. A lot. Maybe too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a pack thing, actually,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles thinks, <i>finally, thank you</i>, because what the hell is he supposed to say to that? Especially knowing his dad has caught them more than once, curled up together on the couch, in his time.</p>\n<p>\u201cA pack thing?\u201d He doesn\u2019t exactly sound convinced. Or look it, for that matter, what with the furrowed brows and the suspicious glances back and forth between them.</p>\n<p>Derek glances down at his hands for a second, and Stiles would swear -- swear on his life, in fact -- that he looks almost... sheepish? Embarrassed? The little red tips of his ears give him away the most though, and Stiles isn\u2019t going to think about how he knows that about him to begin with. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s just... werewolves aren\u2019t like real wolves, of course, but we have some of their characteristics, and touch is one of them. It\u2019s especially heightened when there are human members of the pack. It\u2019s partially for protection, but also to identify pack members to other werewolves, and since I\u2019m the alpha...\u201d Derek shrugs, very pointedly ignoring the way Stiles is boring a hole through the side of his head, even though Stiles knows he can feel his stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what about--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, no,\u201d Stiles interrupts. He doesn\u2019t want to hear any more, doesn\u2019t think his brain can handle it right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, let me just get this straight. What you\u2019re telling me is that you\u2019re not in a relationship with each other?\u201d The Sheriff eventually asks. \u201c<i>Really</i>? \u2018Cause I gotta tell you, I\u2019m not really buying it, kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs, tries to ignore the way he knows his entire body is flushed red and hot with embarrassment (and maybe something else, but he\u2019s resolutely not going to even start thinking about that right now). \u201cWell you should, because it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>And thankfully -- praise be to whatever deity is looking down and smiling at him for once in his ridiculous life -- his dad drops the conversation. Everything goes strangely quiet after that, as they finish off the rest of their breakfast without saying anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve, uh, actually got to go in to work for a few hours,\u201d Derek finally says, breaking the awkward silence that\u2019s settled over the room. He stands, brings his dishes over to the counter and turns to the Sheriff. \u201cThank you for breakfast, as always. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stick around to help out with dishes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff waves a dismissive hand at Derek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, son. You can get them next time. Besides, I\u2019ve got Stiles to help me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tries very hard to ignore how his heart skips a beat at his dad calling Derek \u2018son.\u2019 But if the curious look Derek gives him is any indication, it obviously didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Stupid werewolf hearing abilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should be home by dinner,\u201d Derek says. \u201cDo you want me to pick something up on the way, or--?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Stiles says, doing a mental catalogue of what\u2019s in their fridge back at the house. \u201cThere\u2019s enough Sheppard\u2019s pie leftover from yesterday that we can reheat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I guess I\u2019ll see you later then,\u201d he addresses Stiles, then turns back to Dad. \u201cThanks again for breakfast. You\u2019re still coming over to watch the game on Thursday?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff smiles and nods. \u201cYup. I\u2019ll see you then, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles walks Derek to the door. \u201cSo, that was fun, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he asks with a smile that\u2019s a little too bright, a little too forced.</p>\n<p>But Derek merely shrugs, his face frustratingly blank. After all these years, Stiles feels he\u2019s mastered the art of reading Derek\u2019s subtle expressions, so it always irritates him when he purposely hides what he\u2019s thinking. This is one of those rare times when it would be really nice to know that things are still good between them, what with the recent dating accusations. Dating suggestion? Dating enquiry? It wasn\u2019t really an accusation, per se. Whatever. With the whole Dad Thinks We\u2019re Together thing, capital letters.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop stressing,\u201d Derek says eventually, quiet, reaching over to squeeze Stiles\u2019 shoulder before turning to go. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Stiles remains rooted to the ground, scratching absently at the back of his neck as he watches Derek walk to the car.</p>\n<p>Derek is long gone by the time he finally closes the door and turns back to the kitchen. He\u2019s just avoiding facing his father, he reasons, which is why he\u2019s taking his sweet time. He isn\u2019t, however, expecting his dad to be standing a few feet away, arms folded across his chest, a knowing look on his face. Shit, how long has he been there?</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, son?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>So</i>?\u201d Stiles sputters, kicking his shoes into the corner and locking the front door behind him. He\u2019d whipped out his phone the second he\u2019d pulled up to the house, and miracle among miracles, Scott actually answered. Of course, he\u2019s not so pleased about that now. \u201cMy dad thinks Derek and I are <i>dating</i>, Scott. Did you miss that part?\u201d</p>\n<p>The asshole actually has the audacity to laugh. As if this is somehow hilarious to him. Worst best friend ever. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not funny, Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it actually kind of is, though,\u201d he says with what Stiles imagines to be a huge shit-eating grin plastered to his face. \u201cI just don\u2019t see what the big deal is. I mean, I\u2019m not surprised, to be honest--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Stiles interrupts.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on, Stiles, you\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does everyone keep saying that?\u201d He flops down on the couch with a loud groan, letting his feet dangle off the edge. This is not the kind of conversation he can do standing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need me to explain it to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, no! My dad already did that just fine, than--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause honestly, Stiles, for a while I thought you two were dating too,\u201d Scott continues, as if Stiles hadn\u2019t said anything at all. \u201cFor one, you guys smell like each other. All the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe live together, dude,\u201d Stiles points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s like... it\u2019s not that you smell like Derek and Derek smells like you. It\u2019s like you both smell like <i>DerekandStiles</i>, one word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make any sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it does. Like, you can get someone else\u2019s scent on you by hanging out with them, touching them, sharing some of the same stuff. But you\u2019re still gonna smell predominantly like you, but with other people\u2019s scents mixed in. Like you and your dad, or me and my mom. With you and Derek, though, it\u2019s like...\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t want to ask, but he thinks he kind of needs to know. \u201cLike what, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike your scents have combined. Like you share the same space often, or wear each other\u2019s clothing. Which, actually, I know you do both. But also it\u2019s like... like you\u2019re regularly physically, I don\u2019t know, rolling around with each other or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Scott!\u201d Stiles sputters. He pulls the phone from his ear and glares at it for a second in horror. He can feel his entire body flush red and hot. In fact, he\u2019s sure every werewolf in the entire state can probably sense his embarrassment right about now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Scott says, and he sounds like he\u2019s holding back another laugh, the asshole. \u201cThough you might actually enjoy rolling around with Derek in that way, if you know what I mean. Naked. In case that wasn\u2019t obvious.\u201d And yup, now he\u2019s definitely laughing. Mocking Stiles. Like the evil, horrible friend that he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell was your point?\u201d Stiles demands in an attempt to interrupt the laughing fit at his expense.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust that you and Derek... well, you smell like a couple. Kind of like me and Allison, or Erica and Boyd. Minus the sex. Though there\u2019s definitely a lot of unresolved tension hanging in the air whenever you\u2019re together, so,\u201d he says, when he finally calms enough to keep speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even know what \u2018unresolved tension\u2019 means? Also, who the hell says shit like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brief pause, and then, \u201cI do. And duh.\u201d Clearly they\u2019re both grown adults, that much is painfully obvious.</p>\n<p>Stiles throws an arm over his eyes and tries to tries not to groan. \u201cShut up, Scott. I don\u2019t want to hear any more from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, you called me about this, so now you\u2019re stuck listening to what I have to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>And damn him, he\u2019s right. Scott doesn\u2019t even need to have werewolf hearing to know when Stiles is full of shit, as long as he\u2019s actually listening. He sort of both loves and hates that about Scott at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott sounds almost gleeful when he says, \u201cGood. Now, next point: Derek was your date to mine and Allison\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything, dude. We were both single, and it made sense to go with each other...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou danced together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a \u2018pffft\u2019 sound and reaches up to scratch at his forehead. The back of his neck is itchy too, but he doesn\u2019t feel like moving from his position sprawled out on the couch to do anything about it.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Slow</i> danced.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was just... us fucking around, being silly. Also, I was totally hammered, so it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d He pulls his arm away from his face and waves it around for emphasis, belatedly remembering that Scott can\u2019t actually see him. Though, uh, yeah... In retrospect, that dance had been incredibly intimate, Stiles shamelessly pressing up against Derek\u2019s body, and it may occasionally feature in some of his--</p>\n<p>No. No, he is not doing this. He refuses to see the logic in any of this. (Though a tiny part of his brain keeps asking \u2018why?\u2019 Why is he so resistant to the idea of other people thinking he\u2019s dating Derek Hale? Stiles is sure there\u2019s an answer in there somewhere, but he doesn\u2019t want to dwell on it right now, okay?)</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you shitting me, Stiles? Really?\u201d Scott says with a huff. That\u2019s his \u2018I mean business\u2019 huff too, so yeah... great. This is gonna be fun. \u201cOkay, look. Who do you spend the vast majority of your time with? Outside of work,\u201d he tacks on, before Stiles can give a smart ass response about his students or any of his educational assistants.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess Derek. But we live together, so I don\u2019t think that really counts..\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott carries on, apparently undeterred. \u201cWho do you talk to when you\u2019re upset or stressed out about something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you, sometimes Derek. Occasionally my dad. Or Lydia, though usually that\u2019s a bad plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen what you\u2019re upset about doesn\u2019t have something to do with Derek, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs. He gets Scott\u2019s point, because fine, maybe it\u2019s true that he and Derek talk about pretty much everything. Or, well, Stiles does most of the talking, but now that Derek\u2019s loosened up a considerable amount, he actually has a lot more to say than Stiles ever would\u2019ve imagined.</p>\n<p>Apparently Scott takes his silence for acceptance that he\u2019s correct. \u201cExactly. Look, it\u2019s not a huge deal. You guys make each other happy, right? So who cares what anyone thinks, either way? But, like, why don\u2019t you just talk to him, dude? You\u2019re basically already dating, except without the fun stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Scott</i>,\u201d Stiles groans, even as his brain starts to imagine some of the \u2018fun stuff\u2019 he and Derek could get into, and fuck, the mere idea of having sex with Derek is suddenly turning his insides to mush and awakening his dick.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, you know it\u2019s true.\u201d He sounds so smug. Stiles suddenly really wishes Scott was here so he could punch him in the face. \u201cBut, if you really think you\u2019re not dating Derek, then when\u2019s the last time you went on an honest-to-god date, Stiles? And don\u2019t bullshit me, because I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is tempted to make up something anyway, just to spite him. But Scott\u2019s right -- he would know if Stiles is lying, even without being able to hear his heart right now. He glares up at the ceiling balefully, trying to remember the last time he actually went out with someone and called it a date.</p>\n<p>Nothing\u2019s coming to mind, though. Not a single, fucking thing. And fuck, has Stiles\u2019s life really been this pathetic, because come on, he damn well knows he\u2019s been on dates before. Plenty of dates. Plenty of awesome, enjoyable dates. But like, has he really gone on anything since he graduated from college? That\u2019s almost two years. Two goddamn years.</p>\n<p>He continues to wrack his brain for something, but every time he remembers going somewhere -- like to the museum, or out for dinner and a movie, or to the county fair, or to some weird art gallery exhibit -- it inevitably leads back to Derek. There was Lauren, a girl he went to college with who was also from Beacon Hills that he\u2019s seen a few times since returning home. But no, wait, come to think of it, Stiles thinks she might actually have a boyfriend already. There\u2019s also that one EA that maybe asked him to hang out a few times, but he had to turn him down because of a couple pack meetings and then prior plans with Derek, and eventually he\u2019d just stopped asking altogether. Which means...</p>\n<p>Oh. <i>Oh</i>. Well, fuck.</p>\n<p>Since when did Scott decide to go and get so fucking observant?</p>\n<p>Finally, after a good several minutes have passed (damn, Scott\u2019s patience has improved considerably since high school), Stiles reluctantly admits, \u201cI... don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first, Stiles thinks that maybe Scott hung up on him, the line eerily silent all of a sudden. \u201cWhat do you think that means?\u201d he asks eventually. But despite having every reason to, Scott doesn\u2019t sound smug at all. In fact, if Stiles didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d say that Scott was actually being supportive... gentle, almost.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus <i>Christ</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just me, Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, okay, that supportive streak ended pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. That\u2019s not even a little bit funny or clever. It\u2019s like the oldest joke in the book. You suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But I bet you Derek wo--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>. I hate you,\u201d Stiles says sincerely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, buddy,\u201d Scott replies with another laugh. \u201cGood luck with Derek. I\u2019ll make sure to keep the rest of the pack away from you guys for a few days, in case you want to make up for lost time or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>And fuck him, Stiles can actually <i>hear</i> his suggestive eyebrow waggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the worst friend ever. Nope, the legit actual worst, man,\u201d he says and hangs up the phone to the sound of Scott\u2019s hysterical laughter ringing in his ears.</p>\n<p>Stiles is so incredibly fucked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>There\u2019s just the small matter of where he\u2019s apparently been dating Derek for the past couple years without actually realizing, despite the fact that everyone else around him seems to be quite in the loop on that little revelation.</p>\n<p>And he may or may not have fallen for Derek without even having any conscious awareness of it. Which, okay, maybe that\u2019s not quite true. Stiles has had a thing for Derek since high school, but back then it mostly consisted of lust and a hopeless teenage fantasy. In recent years, sure, he\u2019s thought about it one or two (or four hundred) times -- what it would be like to be with Derek, now that they were actually friends and Derek no longer hated him (most of the time).</p>\n<p>Fuck. Stiles is supposed to be the <i>smart</i> one in their little group. Well, that title probably officially goes to Lydia, but he figures he\u2019s a close second. How had he missed all the signs?</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even really tolerated Derek until sometime in his junior year, despite his crush, and only started liking him towards the end of senior year. But then college happened, and everything sort of just shifted on its axis. At first it was just the occasional text or e-mail, then phone calls, when something important was going on. But somewhere along the line, the crises slowed down, and yet the texts and e-mails and phone calls continued. Then one day, Derek just showed up in Stiles\u2019 dorm room, uninjured and with no apparent reason for being there. It\u2019d been a little strange and somewhat awkward, but Stiles had liked it. Apparently so had Derek, since he kept returning, at first once a month, and then, in the last year of college, he visited Stiles almost as much as Stiles visited home (which was almost weekly).</p>\n<p>And it isn\u2019t even the fact that they moved in together, or the fact that he hasn\u2019t been on a date in ages (thank you very much for that little reminder, Scott). Stiles hasn\u2019t had sex in... God, he can\u2019t even remember the last time he had sex, is how long it\u2019s been. Ugh, that\u2019s ridiculous and pathetic, and how had he not noticed something was up (ha, <i>up!</i>) with him this whole time? Stiles had a few relationships while he was in college. Nothing that lasted particularly long, but he still enjoyed them all the same. Sex used to be a semi-frequent occurrence. But then he\u2019d moved in with Derek and... not so much anymore. Which is not to say that there\u2019s been <i>nothing</i> since moving into the Hale house, because Stiles still has needs, all right, but his hand has kept him company more often than not over the past two years.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs heavily and scrubs a hand down his face. Why did his dad have to be so observant? And worse, why did he have to go and talk about it openly, like it\u2019s no big deal, when it kind of, sort of, maybe is?</p>\n<p>The real problem, though, isn\u2019t that people think he and Derek are dating, because looking back on all the evidence, Stiles is forced to admit that it\u2019s actually a logical conclusion to make. The problem is that now that the idea has been presented to him, now that Stiles has accepted that he may have missed a few things over the last several years, he literally cannot think of anything else in the entire world that he wants more than to <i>actually</i> be dating Derek Hale. And that in and of itself wouldn\u2019t be an issue if Stiles knew he felt the same way. But what he has with Derek is pretty amazing as it is, and the last thing Stiles wants to do is risk screwing it all up.</p>\n<p>He may still be pacing in the living room when Derek returns from work.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you haven\u2019t been doing this all afternoon,\u201d is the first thing Derek says to him. He peels off his leather jacket and hangs it by the door before coming to stand in front of him.</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to joke about it, to play it off like he totally hasn\u2019t been freaking out about all of this all afternoon. <i>Of course not, what do you take me for?</i> Or <i>Please, I\u2019m not that lame.</i> But that would be stupid, because Derek will know he\u2019s lying, or at least deflecting. Besides, this isn\u2019t one of those things he can keep ignoring until it goes away, because Stiles is pretty sure he\u2019s already tried that strategy for years, and look where it\u2019s gotten him.</p>\n<p>Instead, he says, \u201cWell, not the entire time\u201d and then winces. He\u2019s sure Derek can smell his anxiety.</p>\n<p>For a few blissful moments, Derek is silent, still standing stiffly in the doorway, and Stiles can almost convince himself that they\u2019re not going to have this conversation just yet. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s scared of Derek, or scared of talking about this. But Stiles has always guarded his feelings and there\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s terrified that now that he\u2019s realized just how much he wants Derek, the sentiment won\u2019t be returned.</p>\n<p>That hope is quickly shattered, however, when Derek finally says, \u201cStiles, can we talk?\u201d It\u2019s said in a carefully neutral tone of voice that Derek usually only saves for Serious Business conversations, which is not something they have, like, ever.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, stilling momentarily, before following Derek over to the couch. He tries to make eye contact, but Derek refuses to meet his gaze. It only serves to further increase his anxiety. Stiles settles against the cushions at the far end of the couch away from Derek and tucks his legs underneath him in an attempt to contain the restless energy buzzing beneath his skin. He so desperately wants to say something, anything to break the suddenly deafening silence, but he tamps down on the urge, because Derek is the one who started this and so Derek\u2019s the one who also needs to take the lead here.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout earlier...\u201d Derek begins slowly, and Stiles thinks, <i>this is it, this is where he lets me down easy</i>. Ugh, being dumped before you even start dating is the worst.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Derek continues, without any preamble.</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks, because what? What would he have to be sorry about? Unless...</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re sorry?\u201d Stiles asks slowly, ignoring the growing sense of dread forming in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just. Earlier, today. With your dad and the whole--\u201d Derek waves a hand around (it\u2019s eerily similar to Stiles\u2019s own frenetic flailing, and he vaguely wonders when Derek picked up the habit). \u201cIt was. It\u2019s my fault. That he thinks we\u2019re dating, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-- How could you be responsible for dad thinking we\u2019re--?\u201d Stiles\u2019 brain catches up with his mouth about half a second later, and his eyes bug out of his head in shock. \u201cWait, did you, like. Did you actually <i>tell</i> Dad that we\u2019re--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek interrupts hastily. And for the briefest of moments, something like guilt passes across his face before it disappears. \u201cBut I might as well have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks, because in all the versions of this conversation he ran through his head earlier today, this was definitely not one of the possible scenarios.</p>\n<p>\u2018I... don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shifts on the couch, one hand reaching up to scratch at the back of his neck. The fingers of his other hand dig into his thigh in a way that looks just shy of painful, and he\u2019s staring down at the couch cushion as though it just wished him harm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Stiles. You know how your dad and I have grown pretty close since you went away to college?\u201d he asks, and Stiles nods in affirmation, even though Derek still isn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cThe thing is, I sort of talk to him. A lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mean to do it, but the scoff sort of just... falls out of his mouth. \u201cYou?\u201d he snorts incredulously. And yeah, fine, so Derek talks significantly more now than he did during the first few years Stiles knew him, but no one would ever accuse him of being \u2018chatty.\u2019 Ever.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s head shoots up then, his glare so fierce that Stiles feels himself tamping down a smile at the familiarity, despite it\u2019s relative rarity these days.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, me. You of all people should know how much I can talk.\u201d A beat passes before he adds, \u201cWhen I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Stiles says thoughtfully. He suddenly feels incredibly restless, like every muscle in his body is vibrating, but at least his earlier fears have been assuaged. For now. \u201cSo, what do you talk about with my dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLots of things. But, uh, mostly you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Stiles says in what might be considered a high-pitched voice. (Slightly higher pitched. He absolutely does not squawk. Not even a little bit, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a big, fat liar.)</p>\n<p>Derek glances back down at the couch, picking at the slightly frayed cuff of his dark blue Henley and resolutely avoids eye contact. Stiles is buzzing with energy and a certain desperation to find out what Derek has to say, but he knows that pushing him to talk when he\u2019s not ready is pointless. So Stiles fiddles absently with the hemline on his jeans and gives Derek the space he clearly needs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I think your dad figured it out before I did,\u201d Derek says, eventually, voice soft and considering. \u201cI complained about you a lot, you know. About how you never listened and how you were so frustrating and stubborn. How you drove me crazy sometimes. And I mean, I never intended to tell your dad all that stuff, but I did. And he\u2019d look at me in this certain... way. Like he could see through me. Then he\u2019d tell me about your latest conversation, and he always made sure to mention the fact that you missed everyone, even if he knew I\u2019d literally just been down to visit you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence fills the air and for a moment, Stiles wonders if he\u2019s done. But then Derek takes a deep breath and keeps talking. \u201cWhen I first met you, you drove me up the fucking wall. I\u2019d leave most of our conversations feeling irritated and confused, like I wanted to claw my face off--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, harsh, man,\u201d Stiles interrupts, but immediately shuts his mouth when Derek pins him with an icy glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you just be quiet for, like, five minutes? For once in your life?\u201d Derek snaps, but it lacks any real heat.</p>\n<p>All the same, Stiles nods and mimes zipping his lips.</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head suddenly, frowning. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not good at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d Stiles tells him honestly. Derek looks more restless and skittish than Stiles can remember seeing him in a long time, and after only a moment\u2019s hesitation, he reaches over and gently rests a reassuring hand on Derek\u2019s knee.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess, the thing is, it\u2019s really-- It\u2019s my fault that everyone thinks we\u2019re dating. Because despite fighting it at every fucking turn, you somehow still managed to claw your way under my skin and just... stayed there. I didn\u2019t want you there. Hell, I don\u2019t know how you even <i>got</i> there. But you were anyway. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I guess, after a while, I gave up on fighting it, because I was so sick of pretending that it wasn\u2019t true, that I didn\u2019t want to be around you all the time. But I did. And I started to miss your scent, and when I\u2019d visit you, I tried to touch you as much as I could so it would linger and stay with me until you came home. I was so fucking obvious about it that I may as well have hired a skywriter to broadcast my feelings for you across the sky so the entirety of Beacon Hills would know, instead of just the majority. So, uh,\u201d Derek reaches up and rubs at the back of his neck, head finally peeking up to meet his gaze, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That I never told you, and that it makes you uncomfortable that people think we\u2019re together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every muscle in Derek\u2019s entire body looks tense as he stares at Stiles, but his expression is more earnest and open than Stiles can ever remember it being, and it literally sucks the breath from his lungs as he grasps the enormity of what Derek\u2019s just confessed to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles says, when he finally finds the words to speak. His heart is literally swelling up with affection for Derek right now, the feeling so intense that it\u2019s almost suffocating. Leave it to Derek to be the biggest fucking closet romantic in the history of the world, without even realizing it. He thinks his chest might literally burst with all the emotion he\u2019s suddenly feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek starts slowly, when he doesn\u2019t follow up with anything else. Derek\u2019s got that worried look in his eyes that he gets when he thinks he\u2019s messed something up and can\u2019t let it rest until it\u2019s resolved. But Stiles is having none of that tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, be quiet,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNo more talking. You had your turn, now it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is suddenly acutely aware of how far apart they\u2019re sitting on this couch. It\u2019s like Derek\u2019s on another continent, and he doesn\u2019t like it. So, Stiles scoots forward, until he\u2019s a couple inches away from Derek, settling back down against the cushions. Despite the fact that Derek seems to startle a little at the movement, he doesn\u2019t protest or try to run away, so Stiles considers it a success, overall.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re a moron,\u201d he says, but can\u2019t help the grin when he sees Derek\u2019s surprised expression. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve basically been, like, totally crazy for you since high school, and I have no idea how you never figured it out, because I thought you were supposed to have your special werewolf smelling powers, or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls at the last part (he hates it when Stiles calls their heightened senses \u2018werewolf powers\u2019, so, naturally, Stiles makes a habit of saying it as often as possible, just to piss him off), but some of the tension leeches out of his body as he slumps forward. His lips twitch up at the corners then, briefly, but still noticeable, and Stiles recognizes it as one of Derek\u2019s small, private smiles that he chooses to believe belongs to him alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why you never said anything, man. It\u2019s been years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI--\u201d Derek says, stops. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve allowed myself to want something, some<i>one</i>, again. I guess I was just... scared.\u201d He swallows, sucking in a shaky, shuddering breath that would likely go unnoticed by anyone who didn\u2019t know Derek incredibly well.</p>\n<p>And it hits Stiles then that no matter how much Derek has matured, no matter how much he\u2019s healed from some of his old wounds, it still costs him so much to admit fear of anything, but especially to admit to being afraid of opening his heart to someone again. All the same, they need to be on the same page for this one, so he can\u2019t let something like this drop, much as he doesn\u2019t want to push.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf what?\u201d asks Stiles, furrowing his brows.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf you not feeling the same. Of losing you. God, Stiles, it\u2019s complicated. I don\u2019t exactly have a great history when it comes to, you know,\u201d he throws a hand out again, \u201cthe people I love. And I just... couldn\u2019t risk it. With you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what, you just made the decision for both of us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not that, Stiles, and you know it. I just... things were so good, and I didn\u2019t want to upset that, to risk it. I... couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something more there, something underneath those words that he\u2019s not saying. But Stiles has known Derek for far too long now, knows him better than probably anyone, and by this point, he hears what\u2019s not being said almost as loudly as what <i>is</i> being said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly think... after all this time that I\u2019d-- that I would just up and leave you. That I wouldn\u2019t want to have anything more to do with you over this. Or, like, anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s silence is answer enough -- and it should make him mad, he should be <i>furious</i> that after all this time, Derek still thinks that people are going to abandon him, that <i>Stiles</i> is going to abandon him like he means nothing and can be so easily tossed away. But before Stiles can think better of the action, he pushes up onto his knees and climbs into Derek\u2019s lap. It\u2019s a little awkward for a second, until Stiles positions himself so he\u2019s straddling Derek, and it\u2019s oddly comfortable when he settles back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a stupid, fucking idiot, you know that?\u201d Stiles asks, before leaning forward and wrapping his arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders, burying his face in his neck and sighing heavily into the warmth of his skin. Stiles has learned over the years just how tactile of a guy Derek really is, and he knows that sometimes touch speaks volumes over what any words could say.</p>\n<p>For a moment Stiles thinks he may have overstepped his bounds, but just as he\u2019s about to pull away he feels Derek\u2019s arms wrap around his waist, pulling him impossibly closer, before one hand snakes up the back of his neck and buries in his hair. They hold each other for what feels like hours, and Stiles thinks, <i>yes</i>, and <i>home</i> and <i>iloveyou</i>, and he hopes Derek understands what he means, what he\u2019s trying to convey with touch instead of words.</p>\n<p>When he finally pulls back to look at Derek, Stiles feels his mouth go dry, like the air is being slowly sucked from the room and he can no longer breathe. Derek\u2019s eyes are dark, his gaze so intense that Stiles\u2019 stomach drops, heart thundering in his chest. Unconsciously, his tongue darts out to lick his lips, and Derek\u2019s gaze follows the entire movement, mesmerized. He\u2019s not sure who moves first, but one moment they\u2019re looking at each other, and the next, they\u2019re kissing.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s lips are soft and a little chapped, but they move with such precision that if Stiles didn\u2019t know better, would think came from years and years of practice. Or maybe it\u2019s just a natural werewolf talent. It\u2019s a thought that dies almost immediately, however, when Derek licks his way into the heat of Stiles\u2019s mouth, deepening their kiss, and he can\u2019t quite tamp down the low moan in response. Derek\u2019s hands slide underneath Stiles\u2019s shirt, blunt nails dragging down the muscles of his back, and it\u2019s so hot and intimate at the same time that it makes Stiles shiver. One of Stiles\u2019s hands fists in Derek\u2019s hair, the other still gripping desperately at the front of his shirt, holding him close.</p>\n<p>Stiles groans as Derek trails hot kisses down his jaw line and throat, and he knows he\u2019s already getting hard. Experimentally, Stiles grinds down on Derek\u2019s lap and is rewarded with a moan from Derek as he instinctively arches up to meet him, just as hard and turned on as Stiles. Derek\u2019s hands grip at his hips, fingers digging into the bones, just shy of painful, and Stiles\u2019s hands find their way back into Derek\u2019s hair, pulling him back into a wet, dirty kiss as they continue to grind against each other.</p>\n<p>Pleasure courses through him every time their cocks meet, even between four layers of clothing, and Stiles knows, embarrassingly so, that he\u2019s not going to last long at this rate. It\u2019s not just what they\u2019re doing, because Stiles has done this more than once in his lifetime and it\u2019s never turned him on quite like this. He knows it\u2019s because it\u2019s <i>Derek</i> that he\u2019s with, gorgeous, stubborn, beautiful Derek, that has always been there for him unwaveringly, even when he didn\u2019t always want to be. Derek, the one person that Stiles fell in love with despite everything. And as Derek continues to kiss him desperately, driving up into him like he\u2019s afraid this is the only chance they\u2019re going to have to be together, Stiles feels a thrill at the idea that this is just the beginning.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Stiles, I need--\u201d Derek gasps against his mouth, fingers reaching down to the fly of Stiles\u2019s jeans. \u201cI just-- I need to touch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles barely has time to grunt his complete and total acceptance of this plan before Derek is undoing his fly, fingers hot on his hips as he starts to slide Stiles\u2019s jeans and boxer briefs down. Stiles arches up, giving Derek more room to push down the offending articles of clothing. Then his cock is finally freed from the confines of his underwear, straining hard against his stomach, already leaking precome. Derek stares down at it for a few moments, eyes soft and almost reverent, before wrapping a hand around his length and giving an experimental tug.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles moans, pressing forward to lick back into Derek\u2019s mouth as Derek runs his thumb back and forth across the slit of Stiles\u2019s cock. Pleasure shoots down his spine and all Stiles can think is <i>fuck</i> and <i>Derek</i> and <i>yespleasemore</i>. He slides his hands back under Derek\u2019s shirt, running his fingers over the muscled planes of Derek\u2019s body. He\u2019s seen him shirtless too many times to count, but he\u2019s never been able to touch, to explore his body in this way, and it\u2019s incredible. Amazing. Everything he could\u2019ve imagined and more. Stiles runs a thumb over Derek\u2019s nipple before pinching it gently, and the sound Derek makes sends heat straight to Stiles\u2019s groin.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much clothing,\u201d Stiles groans then, because he wants Derek\u2019s nipples in his mouth and his cock in his hand and he can\u2019t do either of those things while Derek\u2019s fully clothed.</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Derek loosens his grip on him, and Stiles climbs out of Derek\u2019s lap long enough for them to both shuck their clothes before settling back in. Derek\u2019s cock is slightly longer than Stiles\u2019s, uncut and full, and he gasps when it brushes up against Stiles\u2019s as he repositions himself. Derek stares at him with wide, dark pupils, his hair wild, lips red and swollen, and Stiles thinks that Derek has never looked so gorgeous in his entire life.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful,\u201d Stiles murmurs before swooping in and kissing Derek breathless, hands roaming and touching and feeling every inch of Derek\u2019s body. He wants to memorize every mole, map every dip and curve, trace every muscle, with his hands and his mouth and body until he knows Derek better than he knows himself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Stiles</i>,\u201d Derek groans, pulling away just before Stiles feels like he\u2019s about to run out of oxygen. He brings his hand up, palm facing towards Stiles, and it takes him several moments to understand what Derek\u2019s even asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to--?\u201d Stiles asks, sticking out his tongue briefly, and Derek just nods, once, lips quirking up at the corners.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. Grasping the back of Derek\u2019s hand, he trails his tongue from the bottom of his palm to the tips of his fingers, making sure it\u2019s wet. It\u2019s so fucking hot and so intensely intimate at the same time, that Stiles feels himself blush in spite of himself. When he\u2019s done, Derek grins at him and shifts beneath Stiles, lining them up, before reaching down and wrapping his hand around both of their cocks, stroking lazily.</p>\n<p>A jolt of heat courses through Stiles\u2019s body as their cocks rub against one another and he instinctively rocks into Derek\u2019s hand, urging him on. Stiles\u2019s hands move to grip at Derek\u2019s biceps as he leans forward to trail kisses down his jaw line, to lick the skin underneath his Adam\u2019s apple, to suck gently at the soft skin where neck meets shoulder. Derek moans, heady and breathless, quickening his his strokes as Stiles continues to move down his body. Stiles moves his thumbs to circle each of Derek\u2019s nipples, before leaning down and taking the right one into his mouth, running his tongue over the raised nub.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles... <i>fuck</i>,\u201d Derek gasps, nails digging into his lower back, his breaths coming out in short puffs now. Stiles bites at the nipple, then sucks for a few more seconds before shifting to the other side.</p>\n<p>Stiles can feel his orgasm building steadily, the pleasure curling in his belly, and based on Derek\u2019s erratic breathing, Stiles can tell that he\u2019s close too. Stiles drags his mouth away from Derek\u2019s nipple to lick back into his mouth, and he reaches one hand between them, wrapping his hand around Derek\u2019s to help him jerk them off. He barely gets a few strokes in before he cries out and is coming, his orgasm hitting him with such ferocity that he feels like he might pass out. Derek strokes him through the aftershocks, drawing every last ounce of pleasure out of him, and that seems to be all that Derek needs to push him over the edge before he\u2019s coming too, Stiles\u2019s name on his lips like a plea.</p>\n<p>The air is heavy with the scent of sweat and sex, even to Stiles\u2019s human nose, and he slumps forward, resting his forehead on Derek\u2019s shoulder as they struggle to catch their breath and come back down. One of Derek\u2019s hands trails lazily up and down the curve of Stiles\u2019s spine, soothing and gentle, and Stiles thinks he could get used to this.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>,\u201d he finally says into Derek\u2019s shoulder, when his breathing has mostly stabilized. \u201cThat was pretty fucking incredible. Why the hell did we wait so long to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Derek says. He moves his clean hand to the side of Stiles\u2019s face, guiding him back up in order to press a kiss to his mouth. Stiles sinks into the kiss, parting his lips for Derek\u2019s tongue as his hands grip at Derek\u2019s shoulders, and it\u2019s several minutes before they part again.</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls back, glancing around at the mess around them before saying, \u201cWe should probably clean up or something. And have dinner, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tilts his head to the side, giving Stiles a lopsided grin. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d be okay with going straight for dessert instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans loudly and laughs, in spite of himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend that you didn\u2019t just say that, because dude, wow is that lame, even for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you love it,\u201d Derek counters.</p>\n<p>And Stiles can\u2019t do anything except agree. So, instead, he kisses the smirk right off Derek\u2019s smug face, feeling happier than he can remember being in years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>By the time he arrives home, his dad and Derek are already in the living room, watching the game. He waves and calls out a \u201chello\u201d before toeing off his shoes and dumping a stack of quizzes that need marking on the floor. Derek will nag him about putting it away later, but right now he doesn\u2019t particularly care. He\u2019s tired and hungry. Speaking of which...</p>\n<p>The lingering smell of Derek\u2019s homemade lasagne floats through the air and Stiles all but runs into the kitchen to grab some for himself.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s standing in front of the microwave, watching the numbers slowly count down as his lasagne heats up, when he feels a strong pair of arms wrap around his middle. Almost instinctively, Stiles leans into the touch, smiling brightly when Derek presses his face into the side of Stiles\u2019 neck and inhales deeply.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek murmurs into his ear, low and gruff, tightening his grip around Stiles\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>It should feel weird, probably. Things are still so new between them, in a lot of ways. But it doesn\u2019t. Not at all. In fact, it feels perfect, like they\u2019ve been together forever already. Of course, in a lot of ways it\u2019s true, so maybe it\u2019s not so strange after all. (And <i>god</i>, when did he become such a schmoopy sap? He\u2019ll find time to feel embarrassed about it later, though.) His sixteen year old self would laugh and probably punch him in the face if he ever suggested that he would end up falling completely in love with Derek freaking Hale, of all people. But, well, his early sixteen year old self would also have scoffed at the ideas of werewolves and kanimas and witches... so really, what does he know anyway?</p>\n<p>Stiles turns in Derek\u2019s embrace until they\u2019re facing one another and he brings his arms up to wrap them around Derek\u2019s neck, smiling broadly at Derek\u2019s stupid, attractive face. \u201cHey yourself. Miss me?\u201d he asks, lips brushing against Derek\u2019s, too light to be a kiss, but firm enough to be a promise of more.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, \u2018cause the feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Stiles says, and then Derek\u2019s kissing him for real.</p>\n<p>Even though they\u2019ve only been doing this for a few days (and he\u2019s not even thinking about all the time they <i>could\u2019ve</i> been having incredibly hot sex over the past few years), Stiles thinks that he might never get tired of kissing Derek, of the feel of his lips and his stubble and his tongue (oh my god). So when Derek\u2019s tongue slips inside his mouth, deepening the kiss, Stiles really can\u2019t be faulted for the soft moan that slips past his lips. Especially when Derek\u2019s hands have slid under his shirt, fingers ghosting down the back of his spine, and up and down his sides like he absolutely needs to touch Stiles as much as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>To be fair, they\u2019re both pretty distracted, what with the hot making out that\u2019s going on -- Stiles\u2019s lasagne long since forgotten -- so it naturally comes as a surprise to them both when they realize they\u2019re not alone any more in their kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, do you have any more bee-- whoa, holy crap, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize you were-- Jeez, do you really have to do that in public, where I could just walk in and see?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wrenches away from Stiles as if he\u2019s been kicked and they both turn with wild eyes to see Stiles\u2019s dad, sputtering in shock at them in the kitchen entranceway.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s totally fine Dad, we\u2019re not busy,\u201d Stiles tries for nonchalance, pointedly ignoring the way his face is burning. He feels a little light-headed and he hopes to god he doesn\u2019t look as blissed out as he feels right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek grumbles, lightly smacking him in the arm.</p>\n<p>The Sheriff puts a hand to his forehead with an expression on his face that clearly reads, <i>how is this even my life?</i> Stiles knows the feeling. \u201cOh my god, please tell me you\u2019re not just screwing around with me here, because <i>that</i>--\u201d he points at their faces and makes some sort of weird, puckering thing with his lips that\u2019s almost as embarrassing as what he just caught them doing \u201c--is not how friends act, and if you think that\u2019s the case, then I think we need to sit down and have a serious, and clearly belated, talk about appropriate social boundaries, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek moves so he\u2019s standing beside Stiles now, facing the Sheriff. Without even thinking, Stiles reaches for his hand and slots their fingers together, tugging Derek closer. The tips of Derek\u2019s ears turn red (<i>oh my god, and how fucking adorable is that?</i> Stiles thinks) and he reaches up to scrub a hand through his hair before saying, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I guess I should have told you earlier, but I didn\u2019t really know how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Dad,\u201d Stiles pipes in, \u201cturns out you were actually kind of, like, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised, kid.\u201d The Sheriff still looks mildly suspicious, which is probably fair. \u201cSo, this isn\u2019t some big elaborate prank to get back at me then? Because you two may be family, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not willing to use my power against you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scoffs loudly. \u201cPlease, you can\u2019t arrest us for pranking you, even though that\u2019s not what we-- wait, what did you just say? Did you just call us family? As in me and Derek, plural? Not just me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, nothing gets past this one, hey?\u201d The Sheriff aims the comment at Derek, who blinks at him a few times as if he doesn\u2019t understand, before eventually smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s smarter than he looks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, excuse you both, but I\u2019m fantastic and you\u2019re obviously jealous of my awesomeness.\u201d And then he remembers that he was trying to make a point before he got sidetracked. \u201cWait, though, Dad. Do you really consider Derek family?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, son, where have you been the last few years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-- what? I mean. Oh. Oh. Okay. That\u2019s, um, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d the Sheriff agrees, before striding forward and pulling them both into a hug. It\u2019s a little awkward and a little lopsided, but it feels nice, all the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you guys,\u201d he tells them when he pulls away. \u201cAnd can I just be the first one to say it\u2019s about damn time? Now, let\u2019s get back in there before the game is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later, when he\u2019s finished eating and has curled up next to Derek on the couch, face pressing into the warmth of Derek\u2019s broad chest, one of his arms curled around Stiles\u2019s shoulders, Stiles thinks that yes, it <i>was</i> about damn time.</p>"
