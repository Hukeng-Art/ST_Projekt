  "text": "<p>\u201cIt seems we blotched this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? What gave it away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, dude,\u201d Tony mutters as he moves to the edge of the roof to glance down to the street below. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if you\u2019d let me concentrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man joins him on the ledge. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, \u2018concentrate\u2019? I didn\u2019t know that word was a part of your vocabulary. Maybe you meant \u2018aggravate\u2019? \u2018Mutilate?\u2019 \u2018Annihilate\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, smartass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNauseate\u2026\u201d Spider-Man quickly adds.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>All right</em>, Emily Dickinson. Let\u2019s just be glad no one got hurt,\u201d Tony says, even as he is infrared-scanning the piles of rubble to make sure no one has gotten trapped underneath. He should have called for back-up on this one, but he really though it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Just some idiot flying around on a hoverboard with a gun. Until it turned out that said gun caused shockwaves that could blast entire buildings apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you showed up,\u201d he admits. \u201cThis is bad, but it could have been a lot worse. Of course, the press is going to claim otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns towards Spider-Man now, looking into the brown eyes that peek back at him from behind a pair of silly black goggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you take off that stupid, <em>stupid</em> mask, underoos?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two reasons for it, Stark.\u201d Spider-Man says. \u201cThe first reason is, I don\u2019t want to, and the second happens to be that same reason also.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, looking back down at the debris covering the streets down below. \u201cI am one hundred percent going to blame you for this clusterfuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a real douchebag, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tony replies, smugly.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Pepper sighs a deep sigh as she clicks through the news. \u201cThat was an utter disaster. The press is having a field day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d Tony defends. \u201cThat Spider-Guy never knows when to shut up. Just an incessant stream of nonsense. He distracted me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEither way, your reputation took a blow,\u201d Pepper tells him. \u201cNothing new. And just like the previous one hundred times, it will be fixed, of course. All we need is an inspired bit of good PR to get you back on that insanely high pedestal the public always puts you on. I\u2019ve already set it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSet <em>what </em>up? What, am I going to make flower arrangements with the elderly? Organize a benefit for single mothers in Ethiopia?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper slides a piece of paper towards him. \u201cTry an orphan. His name is Peter Parker. He lives in a group home. He is fifteen. He is exceptionally intelligent. He loves superheroes. And his biggest dream is to meet the great Tony Stark. He was brought to my attention a few weeks ago by some foundation that makes dreams come true, you know the type. I didn\u2019t act on it then, because I didn\u2019t want him to be disappointed when he met the <em>real </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarsh, Pep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still worried about it, to be honest,\u201d Pepper says. \u201cWe need the good publicity. But I\u2019m worried you won\u2019t be able to deal with him properly. Because\u2026\u201d She hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently he doesn\u2019t talk much. Sometimes not at all. Trauma-related.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glances down at the piece of paper, and the picture attached to it. The kid has a wide smile and sparkling, brown eyes. He doesn\u2019t look like an anxious or sad kid. But everyone copes with trauma in their own way. \u201cAll right. Set it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper raises her eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s it? I thought you were going to be insufferable about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease. A smart kid who doesn\u2019t talk? Perfect combination. If only all my employees were like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper eyes him for a while, tapping her pen against the desk. \u201cThe last thing this boy needs is his big hero making fun of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll make fun of a kid for having issues? You don\u2019t exactly have a high opinion of me, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re socially inept,\u201d is Pepper\u2019s unforgiving response. \u201cYou might not intend to make fun of him, but even just by being your sarcastic self, you can really throw people off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for sugar-coating that for my benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony is briefed over the phone by Melissa, a particularly coarse social worker, the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d she says through a crackling line. \u201cOnly thing you gotta remember is to not get all up on him about not talking. And don\u2019t worry, really. Everyone thinks he\u2019s all <em>delicate </em>because he\u2019s so quiet, but he ain\u2019t delicate at all, I\u2019m telling ya. He can be a snarky little shit. He\u2019s just subtle about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony rubs his forehead. \u201cAll right, all right. How will I know what he wants to do? Does he\u2026 - are you in a tunnel or something? The connection is terrible \u2013 Does he write stuff down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not like that. He talks. It\u2019s just he generally sticks to only a few words. As for what he wants to do\u2026 Literally anything you can think of, I can guarantee he\u2019ll be all hot in the biscuit to do it with you. Can you hear me better now? I\u2019m on my balcony. Smells of pigeons out here. He pretty much stopped talking after his aunt died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. He was close with her, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe raised him. His parents died in an airplane crash when he was nine. He moved in with his uncle and aunt. His uncle was shot last year, and his aunt died about half a year ago in a fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Tony mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, not all sunshine and rainbows. So thanks for doing this for him. Very altruistic of you.\u201d There is a strange edge to her voice at that last sentence, and Tony has the feeling that she knows exactly why Tony agreed to meeting Peter in this particular moment.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as bad as Tony expects.</p>\n<p>The boy is smiling ear to ear as he steps out of the car, brown eyes wide with excitement. He makes eye contact with Tony as they shake hands and he even murmurs something that sounds like a greeting.</p>\n<p>Melissa is with him. While on the phone, Tony had imagined her as a tall, plump woman. But Melissa is short and slender, with long hair and long nails. Her voice is way too loud for someone that tiny. \u201cY\u2019all ready for today?\u201d She bellows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d Tony promises.</p>\n<p>Melissa pinches Peter\u2019s arm. \u201cYou excited?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ducks his head as he nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right. Pick you up at four, or call me if you need me. Smell your later!\u201d And just like that, she is gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to come down to my lab?\u201d Tony asks Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told you\u2019re a smart kid. What\u2019s your favorite subject?\u201d Tony asks as they ascend the stairs towards the front entrance of the compound.</p>\n<p>Peter pulls at his shirt. It has a print of two glass vials, both containing a chemical substance. One vial is telling the other: \u201cI think you\u2019re overreacting!\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, so the kid <em>really </em>doesn\u2019t talk. \u201cYou like chemistry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods with a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can work with that. I <em>do </em>work with that. Not always successfully. I almost blew up my lab just last week. You should have seen Pepper\u2019s face \u2013 uh, she\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e. At least, I think she is. I tried proposing to her but she just sort of rolled her eyes. Come to think of it, I should get back to her about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They reach Tony\u2019s workshop and Tony flicks the light switch, bathing the room in fluorescent light. \u201cWelcome to the best place on earth,\u201d he says. \u201cApart from the Seychelles. I have a little mansion down there, it\u2019s lovely. Haven\u2019t been there in five years, with everything going on, so it might have completely caved in by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter quietly steps into the workplace, his eyes scanning the whole room carefully. He points at Tony\u2019s Iron Man suit on a table in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>Tony waves a hand. \u201cYeah, yeah. The suit. We\u2019ll get to that. First, let me show you what I\u2019m working on right now.\u201d He puts his hands on Peter\u2019s shoulders, steering him towards one of the workbenches. \u201cYou know Hawkeye? Of course you do. You know his arrows? Of course you do. I\u2019m trying to make him a set of explosive arrows. The explosion should be remote controlled. So I need a stable explosive that will not detonate immediately when hitting something, but that will explode with an additional catalyst charge. And the explosion won\u2019t do any damage without some form of accessory fragmentation. But obviously arrows are required to be light, so I can\u2019t just stuff it full of C-4. Right? So I\u2019m facing a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter carefully picks up the hollow metal arrow lying on the workbench, staring down at it, slowly turning it over in his hands. For a moment, Tony is entirely sure that the kid didn\u2019t understand a word he just said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHemispherical cavity metal detonators\u201d, says Peter.</p>\n<p>Tony blinks, needing a moment to process that, yes, the first words out of this kids\u2019 mouth are in fact \u2018<em>hemispherical cavity metal detonators</em>\u2019. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Munroe effect?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a slight nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, kid. They told me you were smart. They didn\u2019t say you were a genius. You\u2019re like a fun-size Thomas Edison.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head at that.</p>\n<p>Tony quirks an eyebrow, folding his arms across. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTesla,\u201d says Peter, a smirk appearing on his face.</p>\n<p>Tony bursts out laughing. \u201cSure. Nikola Tesla. Either way, you\u2019re fun-size, funsy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glances down at the arrow in Peter\u2019s hand, then back up at Peter. \u201cDo you want to try and make the calculations?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s face lights up as if Tony just offered him a slice of chocolate pie.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>A message pops up on Tony\u2019s screen. It\u2019s from Pepper, reminding him to get the publicity sorted. Frankly, as soon as Tony heard the words \u2018hemispherical cavity metal detonators\u2019 he had sort of forgotten why Peter was really here.</p>\n<p>Tony glances towards Peter, who is sitting on the other side of his large desk. He reaches out a leg and pokes Peter with his foot. \u201cHey kid. Don\u2019t forget the Grainger Foundation. You gotta write a little message for their website about today. And we'll take a selfie together, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>His own calculations forgotten for a moment, Peter glances sideways at Tony\u2019s screen. When Peter catches Tony looking back at him, he lifts his chin a little as if to say <em>what are you up to?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter seems to accept that answer, dropping his eyes back down to his own work and continuing to scribble out numbers.</p>\n<p>Tony leans back in his chair, tapping his fingers against his desk for a while, frustrated. \u201cYou know Spider-Man?\u201d He then asks.</p>\n<p>Peter makes eye-contact again, cocks his head, then slowly nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may have seen on the news that he\u2019s been working with us lately. You might say he is on the team. Except he isn\u2019t. Because we have no idea who he is and I don\u2019t actually have a way to contact him. He just shows up, usually. I probably shouldn\u2019t be telling you this. Ah, what am I saying? It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll tell anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles, dropping his pencil and leaning his head on his arms as he listens.</p>\n<p>Tony points towards the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to create algorithms and find a pattern in his behavior, uncover his identity, but every time I feel like I\u2019m getting close to him, his behavior suddenly changes completely. Either he is on to me and messing with me on purpose, or he has for some reason moved to a new neighborhood at least three times over the last six months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowns, leaning in. He reaches out and points his pencil towards the words \u2018Predicting Criminal Behavior\u2019 at the top of Tony\u2019s screen. More specifically, at the word \u2018criminal\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not a criminal,\u201d Tony agrees. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to put my life in someone\u2019s hands, I want to know more about the guy than just that he\u2019s terrible at making costumes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chuckles. He stands up, moving over to Tony\u2019s workbench.</p>\n<p>Tony follows his movements for a while, before turning back to the screen and the infuriatingly chaotic collection of red dots all over the map of New York that indicate all past Spider-Man sightings in the city.</p>\n<p>He blinks when Peter pops up next to him and places something tiny on the desk in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting a tracker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sits down, giving Tony an expectant look.</p>\n<p>Tony sighs, running a hand across his face. \u201cI have thought about that. I\u2019m sure I could find a way to stick one to his onesie. But I\u2019m worried he\u2019d notice it, and then we\u2019ll never see him again. I don\u2019t want to chase the guy away. I just want a name and a face. And I don\u2019t want him to know <em>that </em>I know. Does that make sense?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head with a deadpan expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough. At least you\u2019re honest.\u201d Tony picks up the tracker. \u201cHmmm. You know what, maybe I\u2019ll rethink this. If I use a really small tracker, I bet I could get away with it. And it\u2019ll definitely be effective. Thanks, kid. If this works, I\u2019ll buy you a beer. Oh, shit, no. I\u2019ll buy you a lemonade, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Bruce comes by with cookies and drinks. \u201cPepper says you need a break,\u201d he says, curiously eyeing Peter up and down. \u201cWorking hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns his notebook towards Bruce and Bruce chuckles when he sees a cartoonish drawing of Tony in his Iron Man suit. \u201cHey, that\u2019s quite good, kid.\u201d He steps closer, taking the notebook from Peter\u2019s hands and studying it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Tony mutters. \u201cEncourage him. The snide little bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just grins.</p>\n<p>He takes his notebook back and Tony glances over to see Peter grab a green pencil and start on a drawing that is very obviously going to be the Hulk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou just don\u2019t quit, do you? You\u2019re like that Duracell bunny. It\u2019s almost three thirty, though, so we should start wrapping this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up at him, the green pencil hovering above the paper. \u201cStay?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>Tony feels his heart skip a beat, a strangely protective feeling rising up in his chest. \u201cYou wanna stay a little longer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods with a hopeful expression. Tony takes out his phone.</p>\n<p>Melissa picks up after only a single dial tone. \u201cY\u2019ello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s Tony Stark. Are you on your way here yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust about to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we give it a few more hours? We\u2019re in the middle of a project and the kid is really caught up in it. He said he wants to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa remains quiet for a little while. \u201cI can do six o\u2019clock,\u201d she then says.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s \u2018project\u2019 results in the full range of Avengers being immortalized in a series of mildly insulting cartoons. After that, Tony explains his Spider-Man-algorithm in more detail, and Peter offers some interesting insights.</p>\n<p>Before they know it, FRIDAY informs Tony that Melissa has arrived at the compound and is currently parking her car.</p>\n<p>Peter hugs his notebook close to his chest, looking up at Tony with a wistful expression. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>Tony swallows, squeezing Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThank <em>you</em>, kid. You did me a real solid. I had fun today. You have a very bright future ahead of you. Send me your CV after you graduate, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods, his eyes full of a gratitude that Tony doesn\u2019t really feel he deserves.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Melissa rises from her seat in the entrance hall when Tony enters with Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood times?\u201d She asks Peter, and he nods fervently.</p>\n<p>Melissa nods at Tony. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll have him send his report to the Grainger foundation over the weekend, so it\u2019ll appear on their website sometime next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there any way he can stay for dinner?\u201d Tony blurts out.</p>\n<p>Melissa raises a single eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou can stay too, if you want,\u201d Tony tells her. \u201cI feel bad for making you drive out here. You like Thai food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThing is, I\u2019m off the clock in about an hour,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cAnd I got four damn kids waiting for me at home. So I have to take him back to the group home, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could stay the night,\u201d Tony suggests. \u201cAre you back on the clock tomorrow? I can have him dropped off at his school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa gapes at him, before turning to Peter, pointing her thumb at Tony. \u201cThis guy holding you hostage? Blink twice if yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me talk to the kiddo for a moment,\u201d Melissa says, beckoning Peter to walk with her.</p>\n<p>Tony impatiently waits as Melissa has a hushed and mostly one-sided discussion with Peter on the other side of the entrance hall. He understands her dilemma. Hell, if he were in her position, he wouldn\u2019t let a kid in his care spend the night with some billionaire who had a shady reputation at best. On the other hand, why pass up the opportunity to make a kid happy who really deserved it?</p>\n<p>Melissa and Peter rejoin him. Melissa\u2019s face is tight. \u201cAll right,\u201d she says. \u201cJoseph has the night shift. I need to clear this with him. If it\u2019s okay with him, it\u2019s okay with me. And if shit hits the fan tonight, for any reason, call him. Uh \u2013 that\u2019s just my number, he takes over the phone. Also, I assume you can take care of stuff like PJ\u2019s and a toothbrush? Because I ain\u2019t driving up and down just for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d Tony says quickly, lifting a hand to clap it down on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him, promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only as Tony guides Peter towards the living area that he realizes the other Avengers haven\u2019t had any heads-up about Peter\u2019s quiet nature. Immediately, he feels out of his depth. Melissa had told him not bring up Peter\u2019s mutism, but he can hardly waltz in with a kid who barely speaks and not offer an explanation.</p>\n<p>They enter the living area and Tony finds Pepper, Wanda and Steve sitting around the table, all three of them turning to look at him. And his palms begin to sweat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, his brain grasping for a good way to explain the situation. \u201cDid someone order dinner yet? Because Peter and I want Thai food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three sets of eyes blink at him.</p>\n<p>Pepper comes to the rescue. \u201cIs Peter staying for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStaying the night, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go show him his bedroom, then?\u201d Pepper asks pointedly.</p>\n<p>Tony snaps to attention and makes eye-contact with Pepper. Pepper \u2013 yes. She can handle this. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cHis bedroom. Good idea.\u201d He says, squeezing Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cC\u2019mon, Funsy. I\u2019m putting you in a room next to Vision.\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws Pepper a look, and she gives a nod that says <em>I got this</em>.</p>\n<p>Tony quickly marches Peter out of the room again, making a beeline for the bedrooms in the west wing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy is picking up some stuff for you. Anything specific you need? Because now would be the time to \u2013 uh \u2013 say it,\u201d he finishes lamely.</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. Of course.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you like for breakfast? Eggs? Toast? Pancakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything,\u201d says Peter, and Tony chuckles.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The Avengers are surprisingly tolerant about the sudden intruder into their home. Peter, for his part, is surprisingly relaxed about having dinner with a room full of Avengers. Tony finds himself staring contemplatively at the kid who is sitting on the floor, squished between Natasha and Bruce, and listening to some boring lecture by Bruce with rapt attention, while forking down a large serving of green curry chicken rice.</p>\n<p>Melissa had been right. Peter <em>is </em>snarky as hell, in his own way. Nothing about the kid\u2019s demeanor indicates that he is crippled by some form of anxiety that keeps him from speaking. Apart from the fact that \u2013 well \u2013 he doesn\u2019t speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pepper asks in a low voice later that evening, after she and Tony have moved into the kitchen to pack away the leftovers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just \u2013 ah \u2013 working on good publicity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d says Pepper, her voice sounding strangely amused.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony digs up the remote from a bottom drawer somewhere. After only using voice commands for years, Tony is surprised he can still find it. He hands it to Peter so the kid can browse through the movies and pick one by himself.</p>\n<p>The other Avengers have retreated back to their own rooms. Only Pepper is still in an armchair nearby, but she is focused on her novel.</p>\n<p>Tony moves to the kitchen to microwave some popcorn. When he returns to the couch with a steaming bowl, Peter is looking up at him with a questioning gaze. Tony realizes that the kid has paused at the movie Ghostbusters and is now asking for his confirmation. \u201cGolden oldie? Sure, Funsy. Sounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He puts the popcorn in Peter\u2019s lap, making that wide grin appear on the kid\u2019s face again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are nice,\u201d Peter whispers.</p>\n<p>Tony turns to him, a faint smile on his face. \u201cThanks, kid. Not everyone would share that sentiment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, asshole! Watch where you fire those lasers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glances to his left to see something red and blue swing by. \u201cAh, look who decided to show up. Our Spider-ling in his onesie! Late as usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, unlike you I don\u2019t have an expensive AI telling me where to go all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFile your complaint up my ass, kid!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would, but your head is already up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we focus?\u201d Captain America\u2019s tired voice breaks through on the com. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet. Tony, take Spider-Man with you, secure the outer ring, east side. Vision, Wilson, same thing west side. Romanoff and Barton, how are things looking at your end?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hovers in mid-air for a moment. \u201cUnderoos you\u2019re with me! Keep up!\u201d And he blasts away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do they want this time?\u201d Spider-Man bellows out as he swings from lamppost to lamppost.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust attention, if you ask me!\u201d Tony hollers back. \u201cWatch out for their modified \u2013 <em>shit!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A green jet of light misses Tony\u2019s Iron Man suit by a hair. It hits a wall instead, blasting pieces of plaster into the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot him!\u201d Spider-Man yells, shooting his web straight at the offender, plastering him to the side of a building. \u201cHey \u2013 umpf \u2013 maybe not the best time to bring this up, but ah \u2013 ngnghh, damnit \u2013 those contraptions look a lot like whatever the Chitauri flew in on, way back when. Any chance those aliens set up their own little dealership somewhere in lower Manhattan or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we shoot \u2018em first and talk later?\u201d Tony bites out, scanning the area again. He slows down a little until he is hovering in mid-air. \u201cI think we\u2019re clear on this side. Do you hear anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man lands on a rooftop and stands perfectly still for a few seconds, head slowly turning left and right. \u201cNo,\u201d he then says. \u201cHow many were there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a dozen,\u201d Tony says. \u201cRogers \u2013 we\u2019re all good on this side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of them ruined my suit,\u201d Spider-Man says morosely, poking at a large burn hole on his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s like I spend half my time making new ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tony says. \u201cAnd you still haven\u2019t come up with anything better than those pajamas?\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>They converge on a rooftop.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways good to see you, Spider-Man,\u201d Steve greets. \u201cThanks for keeping Tony from getting himself killed yet again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt your service,\u201d Spider-Man replies. \u201cBetween the two of us, I suppose we can keep him from flying into a building.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony had been standing on the edge of the building, looking down at the street where agents of SHIELD were cleaning up their mess. But at that, he turns and steps out of his Iron Man suit. \u201cIf I fly into a building,\u201d he says, rubbing at his sore left arm, \u201cif anything, I\u2019ll be fine and the building will crumble. Unlike the two of you, who prefer to prance around in lycra.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, unlike you, <em>we </em>have super strength, Stark,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Natasha mutters. \u201cHere comes another dick-measuring contest. I\u2019m going home, see y\u2019all there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve waves a hand. \u201cHang on, Romanoff. We\u2019re all going home. Care to join us?\u201d That last comment was directed at Spider-Man. \u201cBruce is making lasagna for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d is the response. \u201cEver seen a spider eat? They will literally puke digestive fluid all over their food and then suck everything back in. --- Jeez, don\u2019t look at me all bug eyed, that was a joke, guys. Point is, I\u2019m not coming. Enjoy the lasagna.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony steps closer and carefully puts a hand on Spider-Man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaybe another time,\u201d he says, squeezing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot likely. Okay, byeeee.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s gaze follows Spider-Man as he runs towards the edge of the building and jumps off, firing webs as he swings away</p>\n<p>He lifts his hand to his earpiece. \u201cFRIDAY, is the tracker in place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a signal,\u201d FRIDAY confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s moving east.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve throws him a puzzled look. \u201cYou put a tracker on him? I thought you had promised him that he could keep his identity a secret?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m a liar, Rogers. FRIDAY, let me know as soon as he stops moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Maria Hill opens the backdoor of a van to give Tony a peek at the shrapnel inside. \u201cI\u2019ll have this delivered to the compound. How long until you can give us an update?\u201d She starts scribbling out a form.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll look at it this afternoon. Can\u2019t promise how much I\u2019ll find. It looks like chitauri tech.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I just want to know where the hell it came from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing \u2018space\u2019 won\u2019t be a satisfactory response?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill doesn\u2019t react to that. She tears the form from her clipboard and holds it out to Tony. \u201cCan I trust you not to completely screw up the paperwork?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly? Probably not.\u201d Tony stuffs the paper into a pocket. \u201cGive Fury a big kiss for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and walks back to his Iron Man suit, lifting one hand to his earpiece. \u201cNo updates on the tracker yet, FRI?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe signal has left New York and is moving northwest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony halts. \u201cWhat? He left the city?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe speed and location suggest that he is on the train to Hartford.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hell? Did Spider-Man jump straight on a train right after the mission?</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, update me as soon as he leaves the tracks.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It takes another hour before FRIDAY returns with an update. \u201cThe tracker has not left the train tracks, but it has been stationary for fifteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHartford train station.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything on the station\u2019s security footage?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing noteworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony has a bad feeling about this. Is it possible that Spider-Man discovered the tracker within minutes, and had simply left the tracker on a train as a diversion? But he doesn\u2019t have much choice \u2013 he has to be sure.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, FRI, calculate my route. I\u2019m flying down there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He prepares for the worst-case scenario, but it\u2019s still a big fat disappointment when he finally reaches Hartford train station and finds the tracker stuffed between two seats of an empty train.</p>\n<p>Damn.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Melissa? It\u2019s Tony Stark. I was wondering if maybe Peter could come over again some time this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome over,\u201d Melissa echoes, sounding stumped.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if he wants to,\u201d Tony quickly adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I think he\u2019ll want to,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cNever seen the kid so excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>A warm feeling spreads through Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cI can have him picked up. Wednesday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I mean\u2026 All right,\u201d Melissa says, still sounding a little reluctant.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect. Can I just ask\u2026 His speaking\u2026 Does he have a diagnosis or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly. Some therapists have suggested selective mutism, but it doesn\u2019t fit great. I don\u2019t know, psychology is complicated shit. All I can say is people deal with trauma\u2019s in different ways. We can\u2019t always label it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if this question offends you, but I gotta know. Is all this still part of your little PR stunt, or is this for real? I just want to be clear if you\u2019re going to drop this kid like a hot brick once you\u2019re back in everyone\u2019s favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d The words come out before Tony even thinks about them. \u201cThe kid gets a few awesome days at the compound, and I get my reputation back.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a long pause. \u201cNo, I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Melissa says, finally. \u201cJust as long as we\u2019re all clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter brings a bouquet of white peonies for Pepper.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so sweet!\u201d Pepper says, enveloping the boy in a warm hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou suck-up,\u201d Tony tells him, and Peter smirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I show you how to properly cut them and put them in a vase?\u201d Pepper suggests to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper, please,\u201d Tony scoffs. \u201cThis kid has an IQ the size of Mount Everest. He\u2019s not here to learn how to use scissors. He\u2019s here to calculate the required torque for base rotation in an Iron Man suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Pepper asks. \u201cPeter, do you want to calculate the required whatever for base whatever, or learn how to cut flowers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlowers,\u201d Peter says, with a grin in Tony\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s only saying that to mess with me,\u201d Tony grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust sit down,\u201d Pepper says, pointing at a chair. \u201cYou could learn something, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so Tony sits there as Pepper goes on and on about how to cut the stems, remove the leaves and get the right temperature of water. It takes about half an hour before Pepper deems them both proficient in the science of vase-filling, and Tony is finally, <em>finally</em> able to drag Peter down to his workshop.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnit, kid,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Peter giggles.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony has found that Peter silence is not a hindrance in their communication at all. The kid might not speak much, but when he does speak, he is a lot more straightforward than most people.</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Peter bluntly informs him, pointing at the hologram floating in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, funsy, all right, I\u2019m still working it out, don\u2019t get on my case. What\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s wrong with it? Oh, yes, I see what you mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little scary how familiar it already feels to have the kid rummaging about in his workplace. He feels like he has known this kid for ages. Like he only needs one glance at Peter\u2019s face to know what the kid is thinking. It doesn\u2019t matter that he only speaks a few words, because Tony always understands what he means.</p>\n<p>Tony focuses his attention back on his Spider-Man algorithm. \u201cTracker didn\u2019t work, unfortunately,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, it backfired pretty damn hard. And now Spider-Man might be pissed off at me. Any other ideas on how to catch him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sits in the desk chair next to him and leafs through his notebook until he reaches the page with his cartoonish drawing of Scarlet Witch, then looks up at Tony with a questioning gaze as he turns the notebook towards him.</p>\n<p>Tony waves his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve asked her, but she said it doesn\u2019t work that easily. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t have a PhD on mindreading. Plus, she has a thing about\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 the ethical side of it, or some bullshit like that. Honestly, I think she just has a little crush on the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyebrows shoot into his hairline.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich, you know, is weird since none of us have seen his face,\u201d Tony continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgly,\u201d Peter suggests with a playful expression.</p>\n<p>Tony chuckles. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, that might be why. Either way, that\u2019s another dead end. What else ya got?\u201d</p>\n<p>A thoughtful expression appears on Peter\u2019s face, and he slowly turns his desk chair around, scanning the workshop as if looking for some secret tool that might help Tony track Spider-Man down.</p>\n<p>Once he has made a full circle and is facing Tony again, he gives a shrug and then holds his hand up in a pistol hand-gesture, imitating the firing of a gun.</p>\n<p>Tony is taken off guard and his hand flies up to his mouth as he barks out a laugh. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re suggesting I shoot him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs, giving him a questioning glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s on our side. I\u2019m not going to go that far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Peter with a smile.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Vision and Wanda prepare chicken paprikash for dinner. Steve and Natasha also join them, while the other Avengers take their dinner in their own rooms.</p>\n<p>Steve means well, but he is clearly a bit apprehensive about Peter\u2019s silence. And if there is one thing Tony has learned, it\u2019s that the more Peter is encouraged to communicate \u2013 be it in words, writing or hand gestures \u2013 the quieter he will in fact become. Tony isn\u2019t sure yet if it is part of a coping mechanism, or just another way for Peter to mess with people.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you prefer potatoes or rice?\u201d Steve asks Peter. \u201cUhhh \u2013point at what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither?\u201d Steve tries. \u201cBoth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLay off him, Rogers,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIf he wants something, he\u2019ll just take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Steve says, pushing several serving dishes closer to Peter so he can reach them.</p>\n<p>Peter glances at the different dishes, then back up at Steve, and Tony can practically <em>see </em>the kid\u2019s trickster brain coming up with a reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cIce cream,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>Steve almost drops his fork. \u201cWhat? Uh \u2013 you want ice cream? On you chicken? Are you \u2013 are you sure? I mean, we <em>have -</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRogers, he\u2019s messing with you,\u201d Tony says.</p>\n<p>Peter giggles as he cuts into his chicken and Tony resists the urge to lean in and ruffle his hair.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>There is no time for a movie that evening, because Peter still has to finish some of his homework. So he sits next to Tony on the couch with his economics book in his lap, while Pepper sits in the armchair and reads her novel.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time do your homework first, all right?\u201d Tony says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do my calculations if you still have your own work to do. I can help you, instead of the other way around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Peter repeats slowly, and Tony feels a little awkward, suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he replies, keeping his voice light. \u201cI mean\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t really thought about it. But we can do it again next week. Only if you want to, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of giving some form of response, Peter starts digging through his backpack.</p>\n<p>Tony glances towards Pepper, who is keeping her eyes steadily on her book, even though Tony knows that she is listening to every word they are saying.</p>\n<p>He turns back to Peter when the kid holds his phone out to him, and realizes that Peter is pointing at the blog at the Grainger Foundation website. \u201cNah, kid. You don\u2019t have to do that anymore. They only set up our first meeting. This one\u2019s all you and me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a puzzled look. \u201cGood publicity,\u201d he says softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, suddenly aware that Melissa probably already blabbered to Peter about their earlier phone conversation. He can\u2019t blame her. She doesn\u2019t want Peter to get his hopes up high and then have them come crashing down. \u201cThe publicity doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 not very good at stability, long-term plans, responsibility. All cards on the table; I like you around, kid. I don\u2019t know, I see something in you. But I have no idea how I\u2019ll feel a month from now. That\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about me. I\u2019m an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head with a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, I am. So I don\u2019t care about the PR, but Melissa is right if she told you not to expect too much from me. I\u2019ll pay for your college tuition, though, if that helps. Or buy you a car, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a long searching look before lifting up his pencil and poking Tony in the chest. \u201cYou are nice.\u201d He declares, poking Tony with each word. And then he gets back to his economics homework.</p>\n<p>Tony glances at Pepper again. She still has her eyes firmly trained on her book. But she is smiling.</p>\n<p>Tony hears a soft thud as someone lands on the roof behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess who, ya douchebag?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for stopping by, underoos, but we got it under control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do. Which is why I just saved a whole crowd of people from some explosive glowy thing that those guys dropped. Saved you from another round of bad publicity. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony turns to him. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt exploded,\u201d Spider-Man repeats. \u201cSo it isn\u2019t really anywhere anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hums. He lifts his faceplate to reveal his face, glancing Spider-Man up and down. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you found the tracker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes. Nice try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing personal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you still came.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop helping people,\u201d Spider-Man says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI try. And while we\u2019re on the topic, last week I was sorta trying to keep someone from getting shot, and then there was a whole car-chase going on, and some dude in wings flew down and grabbed me, and then dropped me in a lake, but that\u2019s not even the important part, because before the guys started shooting at each other they were doing a sort of arms deal, and I\u2019m pretty damn sure they were the same type of weapons that these guys used today, and I\u2019m pretty sure the guy with the wings is the source of the weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, are you on steroids or something? Can you explain all that again at a normal tempo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, grandpa, maybe if <em>you </em>turn up your hearing device?\u201d Spider-Man shoots back. \u201cI followed some shady guys who got together under a bridge. Two guys were selling weapons to a third guy. Not the ordinary stuff, but like\u2026. Do you know the movie Men in Black? Those kinds of weapons. The Chitauri kind. When they drove off I chased them, but a guy with wings just swooped down out of nowhere and basically carried me away. I got rid of him, but I don\u2019t know where the other guys went. They are definitely dealing in some badass weaponry. They probably know the source of the weapons. They might even be the source.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony has about a million more questions he wants to ask. But he eventually settles on: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a way of contacting you that wouldn\u2019t also be a danger to my identity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could always just swing by the compound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say you won\u2019t jump me and force my mask off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could do that right now if I wanted to. But I don\u2019t want us to be enemies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we both already know you put a tracker on me. How much would really change if you put me in a choke-hold right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make a convincing case, Spider-Man. Maybe I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cue I guess,\u201d Spider-Man jokes and, without another word of goodbye, he sprints towards the edge of the building and jumps off.</p>\n<p>Tony gazes after him as he swings away.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little quiet today, funsy,\u201d Tony says, fully aware of how strange it is to say that to Peter. But it\u2019s true. Peter had entered the compound today without the usual cheeky grin on his face. He had allowed Pepper to give him a hug with not much of a reaction, and has now been silently working on his homework for almost an hour.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t respond. He doesn\u2019t even look up from his work.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s gaze lingers on his hunched form for a while longer, before he gives up and turns back to his own project.</p>\n<p>\u201cSad,\u201d Peter then murmurs.</p>\n<p>Tony turns back to him. Peter has abandoned his homework in favor of doodling in the margins of his notebook, a broody expression on his face. \u201cAnything I can help with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cJust happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean. Let me know if you\u2019d rather go home, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>To his horror, that statement seems to bring tears to Peter\u2019s eyes. The kid quickly turns away from him and starts furiously rubbing his eyes with his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>not </em>home,\u201d Peter says, his voice breaking.</p>\n<p>Tony wants to kick himself. He slowly rolls his desk chair closer to Peter, but doesn\u2019t know what to say. \u2018Everything is going to be okay?\u2019 That\u2019s pretty lame, considering everything the kid is going through.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I give you a hug?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>Peter takes a deep breath before he turns back to Tony, their eyes meeting. Tony leans forward and carefully folds the boy into a hug. Peter rests his forehead down on Tony\u2019s shoulder, sniffling quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter my parents died, I holed up in my workshop and didn\u2019t talk to anyone for at least two weeks,\u201d Tony says, as he slowly rubs a hand up and down Peter\u2019s back. \u201cUntil Rhodey dragged my ass out and took me fishing. I\u2019d like to emphasize that that\u2019s the only time I have ever been, and will ever go fishing. I was bored out my skull. I strongly suspect that Rhodey only forced me to come to show me that life could always get <em>worse</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a soft chuckle. \u201cLonely?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>Tony nods. \u201cYeah, of course. Especially at first. It takes some time to bring new people into your life that you can call family. But it happens, eventually. I promise you. I didn\u2019t forget my parents. But I can think about them now without feeling sad. You\u2019ll be okay, Peter. Maybe not tomorrow, or even next month, but you will be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hums before breaking away from the hug, dragging his sleeve across his face one last time before turning back to his homework and picking up his pen.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need any help with that?\u201d Tony offers. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t, but do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter points his pen at one sentence in his book and Tony leans in to read it. It is nothing math or science related, unfortunately. Instead, it\u2019s an essay prompt in his English book: \u2018How has the place where you\u2019ve grown up impacted who you are?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says. \u201cI get how that topic would piss you off.\u201d He leans back in his chair a little, planting one elbow on the desk. \u201cHow about you focus on the city, rather than your family? You\u2019ve lived in New York your whole life, right? What does this city mean to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter appears to consider that suggestion for a moment. Then, he gives a faint smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that an idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter picks up his pen and starts writing, so Tony takes that as a \u2018yes\u2019.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony bakes pancakes for breakfast the next morning. Peter looks tired and pale, but he nods when Tony asks him if he\u2019s sure about going to school today.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext week I\u2019ve got all kinds of meetings on Wednesday, so I\u2019ll see if we can reschedule for another day, okay? Tuesday or Thursday. I\u2019ll call Melissa about it later.</p>\n<p>Peter looks up from his pancake and gives him a searching look.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know all this doesn\u2019t change anything, right?\u201d Tony offers, hoping he is interpreting Peter\u2019s look correctly. \u201cYou can have bad days. It won\u2019t make you any less welcome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice,\u201d Peter murmurs.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>On Saturday afternoon, FRIDAY alerts Tony that something red-and-blue has landed on the roof of the compound.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said I could swing by,\u201d Spider-Man says as soon as Tony's head appears through the roof hatch.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d Tony suggests, halting on the top step of the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony steps fully onto the roof, the glass hatch sliding closed behind him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, underoos?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found out who\u2019s dealing in weapons. Name\u2019s Adrian Toomes. He\u2019s the one who built the wing suit with Chitauri technology. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s getting the stuff, but he\u2019s getting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you know this <em>how</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need more than that before I call the FBI on his ass,\u201d Tony says. He is lying of course. He\u2019s Tony freaking Stark, he needs nothing more than a name to close this case. But anything Spider-Man gives him, might be a clue to his identity.</p>\n<p>\u201cFound the suit in his garage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony huffs out a laugh. \u201cAnd how did you know what garage to break into?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t <em>break into -- </em>Does it matter?\u201d Spider-Man asks, beginning to sound frustrated. \u201cListen, I solved it, you\u2019re welcome. Just do your job and keep those weapons out of my neighborhood from now on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour neighborhood? Which one is that? You are all over New York.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen paying attention to me, have you?\u201d Spider-Man drawls, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the tracker make that obvious already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMade it obvious that you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, not about to argue <em>that</em> point. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spider-Man cocks his head. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t think you\u2019re <em>actually </em>an asshole, right?\" He asks, his tone suddenly changed. \"That\u2019s just stuff I say to mess with you. You\u2019re not an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should get to know me,\u201d Tony jokes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you. You\u2019re nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks into the brown eyes peering back at him through the mask, and suddenly they seem familiar.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head as if to clear it. \u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d he says, mostly to himself.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man snorts. \u201cFine, if you feel that strongly about it, I\u2019ll stick to \u2018asshole\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter is smiling again. And he brought Pepper some tulips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come you never bring <em>me </em>flowers?\u201d Tony complains.</p>\n<p>Peter digs into his pocket, taking out a tiny, wrapped gift.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2026 you <em>did </em>bring me something. You know I was just messing around, right? You don\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter merely raises his eyebrows a fraction and drops his eyes down to the gift for a moment as if to say <em>\u2018just open it!\u2019</em>.</p>\n<p>Tony tears the wrapping paper away and a fridge magnet drops into his hand. A fridge magnet with a picture of Captain America and the words \u2018Best Avenger\u2019 printed above it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter cackles with glee, clapping his hands together, and Tony doesn\u2019t care about the magnet anymore because Peter is happy, and that\u2019s all he needs. He takes a moment to drink in the kids sparkling eyes and wide smile. He glances from Peter to Pepper, and notices the soft smile on her face as she looks back at him.</p>\n<p>Tony clears his throat and looks down at the magnet. \u201cSo, do you suggest I hang this down in my workshop so I\u2019m reminded of it every day, or on the fridge in the kitchen where everyone can see it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter points at the fridge.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m starting to think?\u201d Tony murmurs. \u201cThere is not one Spider-Man. There are multiple people pretending to be the same guy. That would explain the weird algorithms. That theory does require a group of people to have acquired the same super-human strengths at the same time, though. So maybe I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter, who had been working on his homework in silence, merely glances at him for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped the Chitauri attacks,\u201d Tony explains. \u201cSome guy named Adrian Toomes was behind them. Nipped that in the bud. Now all I have to do is see if I can use Toomes to trace down Spider-Man. Or the Spider-Men. Because I have a feeling they know each other. Any ideas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive up?\u201d Peter suggests, not even looking up from his own laptop screen.</p>\n<p>Tony can imagine the kid is losing interest in the Spider-hunt. To be honest, he is getting pretty tired and frustrated, himself. \u201cNot an option, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you get on with your own work, I\u2019ll crack this nut on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>All Tony knows is that Spider-Man claimed to have found the wing-suit in Toomes\u2019 garage. He also claimed that he <em>didn\u2019t </em>break into said garage. If both those claims are true, what would that mean? How would Spider-Man end up in Adrian Toomes\u2019 garage \u2018by accident\u2019? Is there <em>any </em>possibility at all that Spider-Man somehow knew Toomes personally? Well enough to be invited to his house and stumble into the garage by accident?</p>\n<p>Tony has been contemplating that possibility for a few days, now. He has compiled a list of Toomes\u2019 closest social connections. Neighbors. Colleagues. None of them really make sense when juxtaposed to the data Tony already has on Spider-Man. Then again, he doesn\u2019t really have enough data to definitely rule many of them out.</p>\n<p>Peter stands up, picking up his laptop and moving closer to Tony. He turns his screen towards Tony, and Tony sees that the kid hasn\u2019t exactly been doing homework. Instead, he has been googling Adrian Toomes, and he now pointing at a website that shows <em>an</em> Andrian Toomes listed as a member of the Queens Classic Car Club.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could be a member of loads of clubs, though,\u201d Tony says, rubbing his temples to quell an oncoming headache. \u201cIf I have to include <em>all </em>his connections in my research, this will take an eternity.</p>\n<p>\u201cGarage,\u201d Peter says with a meaningful look.</p>\n<p>Tony drops his hands down. Yes, that is not bad thinking. Tony doesn\u2019t have much experience with car clubs, but it would seem logical that these people might spend time in each other\u2019s garage, drooling over cars.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d he trails off, looking at Peter\u2019s screen. He can feel that something is off, but it\u2019s like his brain hasn\u2019t caught up to him yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Potts is inviting you to come upstairs for Dinner,\u201d FRIDAY suddenly announces, and Tony almost falls off his chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou go up,\u201d he tells Peter. \u201cI just need <em>one </em>minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>He needs a moment to work out what just happened.</p>\n<p>Because he\u2019s pretty damn sure that he never told this kid how the wing-suit had been found in Toomes\u2019 garage. So how would Peter know to focus on that?</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he is back on the roof, talking to Spider-Man, looking into familiar brown eyes. <em>You\u2019re nice\u2026.</em></p>\n<p>Coincidence?</p>\n<p>Is has to be. There is no way, no way in <em>hell </em>that what Tony is thinking right now, could <em>possibly</em> be true.</p>\n<p>But still\u2026</p>\n<p>Tony starts his research. Adrian Toomes has a company. He already knew that. He has a wife. She is a lawyer. He already knew that. He has a teenage daughter. She goes to Midtown Tech, the same school Peter is in. He didn\u2019t know <em>that </em>yet. She is not in the same year as Peter, but a little more research shows that the two of them are on the same decathlon team. Maybe they study together. Maybe Liz has invited Peter to her home.</p>\n<p>Coincidence number two?</p>\n<p>Tony pulls up his algorithms, and the seemingly random collection of red dots on the New York map, indicating Spider-Man sightings. It only takes a few minutes and a bit of hacking into CPS, and Tony is able to expertly match the pattern of red dots to the different group homes where Peter has lived over the last months. Suddenly, the pattern makes perfect sense. There is no denying it.</p>\n<p>The only question is what to do next.</p>\n<p>Tony finds Steve staring at the fridge with a tiny frown in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The man asks, pointing at the magnet.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wanted you to know how much we all appreciate you,\u201d Tony says, keeping his expression as serious as possible because he knows how much that will mess with Steve\u2019s head, before grabbing a bottle of wine and moving to the table where the others have already started dinner.</p>\n<p>Peter is sitting between Sam and Bruce, and laughs at something Sam is saying. As if he is just a teenager without a care in the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Steve pipes up next to him, and Tony is aware that he is staring.</p>\n<p>This is not the moment. Not right now. Not in front of everyone.</p>\n<p>After dinner they watch another movie. Just the two of them while Pepper reads in her armchair. Now would be the time to speak up.</p>\n<p>But Tony doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>The next evening Tony is in the living area with Steve and Natasha watching the news when a report about Spider-Man comes up. Something about a foiled burglary.</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>Peter comes to the compound again on Wednesday. He works in the workshop. He has dinner with the Avengers. He stays the night. Happy drives him to school the next morning.</p>\n<p>Tony doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>On Monday evening, Tony comes home to find Peter there, curled up in Pepper\u2019s arms on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, moving closer and taking in Peter\u2019s trembling frame. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper tilts the corners of her mouth down. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t tell me. Just showed up on the doorstep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony kneels in front of the couch so he can make eye contact with Peter. \u201cWhat happened, funsy?\u201d</p>\n<p>No response, Peter just buries his face into Pepper\u2019s woolen sweater. She frowns sadly as she brings up one hand to gently card it through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you call Melissa?\u201d Tony asks Pepper.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony steps into his office to make the call. Melissa picks up after a single dial tone, as usual. \u201cPeter with you?\u201d She immediately asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank god. Why didn\u2019t I think of that? How is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUpset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Melissa says, resigned. \u201cThing is, he keeps clashing with another kid in the home, Denzel, a boy his age who has some anger issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what happened today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently. Possibly other underlying problems. But I wouldn\u2019t know because he doesn\u2019t tell me, now, does he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it happen a lot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite a lot,\u201d Melissa mutters. \u201cHe never ran away before, though. I guess he never had anywhere to run <em>to </em>before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t he be moved to a new group home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is already his third home in six months. At some point you have to try and achieve some stability. We\u2019re hoping they\u2019ll learn to get along. Or ignore each other, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s shitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s fucking shitty, Stark, but it\u2019s the best we can do,\u201d Melissa replies, frustration clear in her voice. \u201cYou tell me how to fix it. I got a teenager with anger issues, another one who doesn\u2019t talk, a twelve-year-old with anorexia and little twins who were given drugs by their parents and are now going through withdrawal. Peter is not the only kid who deserves better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI work sixty-hour weeks, you know, and I only get paid forty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony repeats, sincerely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Melissa mutters. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be venting at you. Any chance you can drop him off? I have my hands full down here right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan he stay here tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa blows out a long breath. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s probably best,\u201d she then says. \u201cI\u2019ll let Joseph know. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony means it.</p>\n<p>He returns to the living area. Peter is no longer clinging to Pepper, instead sitting hunched, cross-legged on the couch next to her. Pepper still has one hand resting on his back.</p>\n<p>Tony takes a seat on the coffee table in front of him, phone still in his hand. \u201cYou had a fight with Denzel?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently that kid has anger issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019not his fault,\u201d Peter whispers.</p>\n<p>Tony lifts his eyebrows. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis dad beat him up. He has trauma. I never got beat up. I\u2019m lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, how the hell does one respond to that?</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a competition, Pete,\u201d Pepper murmurs, gently rubbing circles on Peter\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Tony puts his phone away. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping here tonight, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter has long gone to bed when Tony is still slowly pacing around the living area, broodily staring out the windows.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking about,\u201d Pepper says softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m impulsive. And fickle. What if I take him in and then, after a few months, I just get tired of him and start to resent him? He doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Pepper tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re not impulsive when it comes to people. Look at me. Look at Happy, Rhodey. At Steve, Natasha. How long have we all been here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t stand them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that. The truth is that you are very loyal. Trust me, that\u2019s not the problem. The problem is whether the state will even <em>let</em> you have him. You\u2019d need to survive a background check, go through training\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know so much about foster care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI googled it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stops pacing and turns to her, frowning. \u201cHow long have you been thinking about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince he gave you the Captain America magnet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, something clicked right then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw the way <em>you </em>looked at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony blows out a long breath, seating himself on the couch next to her and poking her in the shoulder with one finger. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with us, Pep?\u201d He asks. \u201cAre we getting married or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course we are,\u201d she replies evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSickness and health, thick and thin, all that? Where would Peter figure into all that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverywhere, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>That sounds about right. When Tony imagines his future with Pepper, it\u2019s very easy to imagine Peter right there with them.</p>\n<p>He looks at Pepper. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you should know.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t bring his schoolbooks with him, so he needs to be dropped off at the group home early the next morning, rather than going straight to school. Tony offers to drive him, eager for a chance to talk to Melissa.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey \u2013 oh, hey,\u201d Melissa says when she opens the door to them. She spares a glance at Tony but her gaze then lingers on Peter, who is shuffling his feet uncomfortably.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it this afternoon,\u201d Melissa replies firmly. \u201cNow, get your ass upstairs, go shake Denzel\u2019s hand and pack for school. Coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>That last question is directed at Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>While Peter escapes up the stairs, Melissa leads Tony into a large kitchen with a long table in the center. It\u2019s surprisingly clean.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many people live here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust five at the moment,\u201d Melissa says as she grabs a coffee mug. \u201cNot including us adults. How do you drink it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a seat. I hope you\u2019ll be able to digest this stuff. It ain\u2019t even my favorite coffee, and I\u2019m pretty sure my standards aren\u2019t as high as yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Footsteps on the stairs, and a moment later Peter appears in the doorway to the kitchen, his backpack slung over one shoulder.</p>\n<p>Melissa squints at him, leaning her hip against the kitchen counter. \u201cThat was a quick handshake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just rolls his eyes, turning to lean against the doorpost. He looks like he can\u2019t wait to get out of here.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was fast. You sure you got everything?\u201d Tony asks, hoping to get one of those rare full sentences out of Peter, just to show Melissa that Peter is comfortable around him.</p>\n<p>But Peter only nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get your Captain America breadbox?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles, now. \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, is that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a noise at the front door and someone calls out a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s Sayan,\u201d Melissa says, leaving her own coffee cup on the table and moving into the hallway. Tony hears her hollering up the stairs for the other kids to come down. Tony stays where he is, but keeps his eye on Peter, who in turns keeps his eye on the front door from his position in the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny specifics?\u201d Tony hears a deep voice, that must belong to Sayan, ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cPete and Denzel got into a fight. But they\u2019re all good now, aren\u2019t you, Pete?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter remains stony-faced.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Melissa says. \u201cNever been better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thundering footsteps on the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello sirs and madams,\u201d Sayan booms. \u201cThe car\u2019s out front. May I help you with your coat?\u201d</p>\n<p>A girl giggles. Tony resists the urge to step into the hallway and get a glance at the other kids. Melissa probably doesn\u2019t need them to be distracted by him right now.</p>\n<p>Melissa appears in the doorway. \u201cTime to go, Pete. Put on a coat, it\u2019s going to rain later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you?\u201d Peter asks Tony with a hopeful expression.</p>\n<p>Tony nods. \u201cOf course, funsy. See you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods and disappears from sight. A moment later, the front door falls shut and a silence descends.</p>\n<p>Melissa returns to her seat, clasping her hands around her coffee cup. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much he talks to you,\u201d she murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Here I was worried that he was being too quiet. I wanted to impress you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony halts at that question. \u201cUh \u2013 I wanted to discuss something important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa glances down at her watch. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the office.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leads Tony down the hallway and through a door. The office can be described as, at best, organized chaos. There are piles of paperwork everywhere and a half-eaten sandwich lying on top of a stack of books.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with the place,\u201d Tony says. Now that he is here, he doesn\u2019t really know where to start.</p>\n<p>Melissa just raises her eyebrows a little as she sits behind her desk.</p>\n<p>Tony shoves his hands into his pockets, beginning to slowly pace the room. \u201cDoes Peter have any kind of prospects for, uh, a foster family or something? Is that even on the table? I don\u2019t know how this stuff works.\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa purses her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s always on the table. But older children are hard to place. There was one couple about four months ago who were considering it, but they quickly turned out to be assholes. Peter\u2019s a tough kid, though. Doesn\u2019t let anyone mess with him. The first time that bitch slapped him in the face, he packed his bags and came right back to the group home. That\u2019s why I trust you, Stark. Because I know Peter wouldn\u2019t put up with your shit if you gave him shit. That is one advantage of growing up in a loving home. He knows when he\u2019s not being treated right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what needs to happen for me to get him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa gives him a long, assessing stare. Tony steels himself for some sort of interrogation, defensively folding his arms across his chest.</p>\n<p>Melissa leans to the side and takes out a flyer, sliding it across the table towards Tony. \u00a0\u201cFirst thing you have to do is talk to your housemates. Because if you\u2019re actually going to follow through on this thing, all adults in your home will be up for evaluation. And you\u2019ll have a heck of a time convincing the agency that someone like Dr. Banner doesn\u2019t pose a safety threat to children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is impossible,\u201d Tony mutters. He picks up the flyer, that has a picture of a smiling girl on the front and the title \u2018all in for the kids\u2019.</p>\n<p>Melissa leans back in her chair. \u201cI don\u2019t think your chances are as bad as you think. Let\u2019s see\u2026 irregular lifestyle, unusual home environment, somewhat questionable reputation\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were explaining how my chances <em>weren\u2019t</em> that bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know the kid,\u201d Melissa says simply. \u201cPolicy says it is always in the best interest of the child if they can go to someone they're already comfortable with. It could be considered a \u2018kinship placement\u2019. They are a lot easier to arrange. You are single, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEngaged, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019ll improve your chances. Unless it\u2019s former KGB-agent Miss Romanoff who you\u2019re engaged to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper Potts. Stark CEO.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave her file the paperwork. Your name isn\u2019t the first thing they should see when evaluating your application, no offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFully agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if your application <em>does</em> get rejected\u2026 I\u2019m sure Tony Stark has way around that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony narrows his eyes. \u201cAre you telling me to cheat my way into getting this kid into my home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Melissa casually studies her long nails. \u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony agrees to return to the group home that afternoon so that he and Melissa can talk to Peter together. All Tony can do all day is aimlessly surf the internet, gathering more information about foster care. He is nervous. He is excited. He is terrified. He is elated.</p>\n<p>He tries not to get his hopes up. Peter might balk at his suggestion. He might have absolutely no desire to spend the rest of his teenage years shacking up with a bunch of super-humans. And honestly, why would any kid ever agree to be under Tony\u2019s supervision?</p>\n<p><em>Stop it</em>, he tells himself. <em>No spiraling</em>.</p>\n<p>He asks Happy to drive him back to the group home that afternoon, because he is worried he is so distracted that he\u2019ll drive his car off the road. Happy of course wants to know why Tony is going to the group home again, especially after Tony informs him that Peter will not be driving back with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just need to discuss something,\u201d Tony explains, evasively.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay, Hap, do you still have that engagement ring?\u201d</p>\n<p>Happy pats his jacket pocket. \u201cBeen carrying it since 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, good. Because I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u2018yes\u2019 last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Pretty sure?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t a literal \u2018yes\u2019, but she said we were getting married. I definitely remember her saying something like that. Which boils down to the same thing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever happened to good, old-fashioned, tradition?\u201d Happy laments. \u201cYou get on one knee, she says either \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 and then we al know what the hell is going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust remind me to give it to her later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Happy turns the wheel and brings the car to a stop. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks up at the group home, taking a deep breath in. \u201cAll right. I won\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Happy says, a knowing glint in his eyes.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it personally if he is doubtful all right?\u201d Melissa says. \u201cHe loves spending time with you. I\u2019ve seen that. But this is a huge step, and he can have his reasons to be hesitant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan he say no?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot technically, unless he has a very good reason. He can file a complaint about his placement, but only once he has already been living with you for a while and has given it a fair shot. Of course, it\u2019s up to you do decide to withdraw if you get a sense that he doesn\u2019t want to do it. But let\u2019s gauge his reaction first and then talk strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tony says, impatiently tapping his fingers against his crossed leg. He is pretty sure that he has barely registered all the information Melissa has dumped on him since they sat down in the office. He just wants to see the kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask him to come down, then,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cI\u2019ll just quickly discuss the formalities with him, and then I\u2019ll leave you two to talk things over, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tony says, having to stop himself from adding <em>\u2018just go get him already\u2019</em>.</p>\n<p>Melissa leaves, and Tony stands from his chair and paces around the room as he waits, repeating everything he wants to say over and over in his head, until the door opens and Peter appears.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kid,\u201d Tony says, grasping for one of his usual quips, but coming up with nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Peter responds, immediately looking nervous and wary. Tony gives an encouraging smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake a seat,\u201d Melissa says, pointing at the chair that Tony had vacated, and sitting behind her desk again. She doesn\u2019t beat around the bush, not even a little bit. \u201cMr. Tony Stark and Mrs. Pepper Potts are planning to apply to become your permanent foster parents. That application is not yet final \u2013 and frankly, might take some work to get approved \u2013 but if it does, you\u2019ll be moving in with them. They would become your primary guardians and assume all responsibility over you. You would move out of the group home entirely. You will remain in the same school. Any questions so far?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter is practically gaping at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo? Then I\u2019ll leave you to talk it over. Come out whenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d she says. And she leaves.</p>\n<p>Even for Tony, who knew what was coming, that was a lot to process in a few seconds.</p>\n<p>He slowly turns to Peter who is still staring at the empty seat that Melissa has vacated, his expression full of shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cPete, look at me,\u201d he coaxes.</p>\n<p>Peter snaps his mouth shut, then turns to look at Tony. There is a tiny frown on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just need to know how you feel about this, okay? First reaction? Horrified, relieved, confused?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter slowly stands up from his chair, shuffles forward and then wraps both his arms around Tony\u2019s waist, tucking his head under Tony\u2019s chin and burying his face into Tony\u2019s coat.</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Tony lowers his arms around Peter, squeezing him extra tight and leaning in to drop a kiss into Peter\u2019s brown hair. \u201cDoes that mean you want to do this?\u201d He asks. \u201cBecause I want you to know that it\u2019s perfectly okay if you don\u2019t. You\u2019ll still be welcome to come to the tower once a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter releases him and returns to his chair, remaining silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cMelissa suggested that, while we wait for this application, you could stay with us on the weekends instead of Wednesdays, so we have more time together. And even if this foster thing falls through, we can always keep doing that, all right? Or I create an internship for you and you come over every day. Or we get you emancipated when you\u2019re sixteen and you move in then. The point is, no matter what, you have us. Understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks down at his hands and Tony can\u2019t help but think that the kid looks a little sad. He steps forward and kneels in front of Peter\u2019s chair. \u201cHow are you feeling right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony blinks and rears back a little, startled at the sudden admission. Peter goes frighteningly still and ducks his head between his shoulders as if he is expecting Tony to start yelling at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, kiddo,\u201d Tony softly says, reaching out and squeezing Peter\u2019s knee. \u201cI know. But thanks for telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up with a startled expression. He searches Tony\u2019s eyes for a moment. \u201cEveryone?\u201d He whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, just me and Pepper know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve known for maybe two weeks. Told Pepper last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony scoffs. \u201cHey! You\u2019re the one who bullshitted me into putting a tracker on Spider-Man\u2019s suit, and made me fly all the way to Hartford!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chuckles softly, his shoulders relaxing. \u201cThat was funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou little shit,\u201d Tony says with a fond smile, reaching out to take one of Peter\u2019s hands in his. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cIt\u2019s not an obstacle. And it wasn\u2019t a requirement either. It\u2019s just\u2026 a happy coincidence. Pepper and I feel like the three of us fit together. We hope you feel the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter slowly nods, flexing his fingers and turning his hand over so he can interlace his fingers with Tony\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how this is going to work out,\u201d Tony murmurs. \u201cI probably won\u2019t pass a lot of the tests. I considered not telling you until I had everything sorted, just in case it falls through and it was all for nothing. But I want you to know. I want you to know that I\u2019m going to fight for you. <em>We\u2019re </em>going to fight for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up at him again, his face hopeful and full of raw emotion, tears shining behind his eyes. Feeling his throat close off with emotion, all Tony can do is lean forward again to pull his kid in for another hug, one hand stroking Peter\u2019s hair, the other rubbing his back in soothing motions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper, we both know I\u2019d be desperately lost without you. I\u2019m still desperately lost most of the time when I\u2019m <em>with </em>you, so you have your work cut out for you. But no one else could do it like you do. Will you marry me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say \u2018yes\u2019 to this about a hundred times already?\u201d Pepper asks with a smile that reaches her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but as I\u2019ve understood, Happy won\u2019t be satisfied until I \u2018put a ring on it\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d Pepper says, holding out her hand.</p>\n<p>Tony plucks the ring out of the box and carefully slides it onto Pepper\u2019s finger, before leaning in for a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cA husband and a kid,\u201d Pepper murmurs. \u201cDo you think we should get a goldfish, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUp to Peter,\u201d Tony says, smiling. \u201cSo. On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate this proposal? Just so I can brag to Happy about it later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d put it at twelve percent.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony is in no mood to take the Avengers on all at once. But the idea of having to sit them down one by one is even worse. He has tried to trick Pepper into doing it for him, but she sees right through him, damnit.</p>\n<p>So he sends the message \u2018<em>Avengers, Assemble\u2019 </em>to everyone and waits in the living area for the others to show up.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo items on today\u2019s agenda,\u201d he announces. \u201cNumber one: Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Number two: Pepper and I are applying to become his foster parents. Any questions?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper sends him an exasperated look from across the room. Which reminds Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, also, Pepper and I are now officially engaged. I suppose that\u2019s item number three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Rhodey says. \u201cAlso, what the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony adopts a businesslike tone. \u201cPepper and I are filing the paperwork soon. If all goes well, he\u2019ll be moved from the group home and move in here. Since Peter is enhanced, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make a good fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve is frowning. \u201cEven if he is enhanced, he is not a soldier. He is a kid. His abilities shouldn\u2019t determine what happens to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is lost for a moment, until he realizes what Steve is talking about. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly think that his powers are the reason why we want to take him in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s just a coincidence?\u201d Steve asks skeptically.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013 no, Rogers, you\u2019re right,\u201d Tony snarls. \u201cI already have Bruce\u2019s lab prepared to start experimenting on him as soon as he steps foot in this place!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, calm down,\u201d Pepper says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like what he\u2019s insinuating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s looking out for Peter. You should be happy about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn Pepper and her irrefutable logic.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Tony bites out. \u201cThanks for looking out for my kid by accusing me of child abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve holds up a hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I just figured that Fury was probably behind this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Tony says. \u201cNo one at SHIELD knows, and I\u2019d like to keep it that way for the time being. At least until the paperwork is final and they can\u2019t try to meddle with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust Fury?\u201d Natasha asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust him to think in humanity\u2019s best interest. That leaves it up to us to think in Peter\u2019s interest. Can I trust you not to go blabbing to him, Romanoff? Barton?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Natasha says, \u201cbut only because the kid is so damn cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint snorts. \u201cI second that. But, ah, have you all met Peter? And have you all met Spider-Man? Please explain to me again how they are the same person? Is the non-speaking thing part of his cover?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not. Honestly, we haven\u2019t discussed it much. But I imagine he finds it easier to speak freely when no one knows it\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo now that we know it\u2019s him, are we gonna get a quiet Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Barton, we\u2019re just figuring it out as we go along. We have some kind of foster care workshop tomorrow, FYI, so Pepper and I won\u2019t be here for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually <em>going </em>to those?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs. \u201cMight as well. It\u2019s not like we have a lot of experience to fall back on. I might pick up something useful. And there\u2019s only going to be a handful of other people, so I don\u2019t think our appearance will cause a stampede.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you just talk us through how you came to this decision?\u201d Rhodey asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just fits in,\u201d Tony says, looking at Pepper for confirmation as he speaks. \u201cPepper and I both feel it. If you\u2019re asking me to explain it \u2013 I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just a feeling. Frankly, I don\u2019t need any of you to approve. But if you disapprove, I\u2019ll thank you to keep it to yourself and just let us raise the kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make a good dad,\u201d Rhodey says.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Pepper is restless the rest of the week. Tony understands. Now that they made their decision, she wants to see Peter. She hasn\u2019t gotten to talk to him yet, not like Tony has.</p>\n<p>Tony has done everything he can think off.</p>\n<p>He bought parenting books. He doesn\u2019t read them, of course, but he displays them nicely front and center on the shelves in the living area, anticipating the Agency\u2019s home visit. He ensured new safety regulations on his workshop and Bruce\u2019s lab upstairs. He wouldn\u2019t ever actually keep Peter out of them, of course, but he wants to give the impression that the house is childproof. He even asked Wanda and Vision to teach him to cook chicken paprikash, just in case he is accused of not being \u2018homely\u2019.</p>\n<p>Their application is still rejected.</p>\n<p>Tony calls Melissa the same day he gets the news. \u201cAll right, Melissa. Who do I need to bribe to make this happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll send you a list of names. Start there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony calls every name on the list. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d He asks each of them. \u201cFancy new car, fancy new carpet in your office, a big fat portrait of you by the reception?\u201d He also sets up a separate foundation for children in group homes. He was going to do that either way, after everything he has learned these past months.</p>\n<p>Their application gets accepted.</p>\n<p>Tony calls Melissa back when he gets the news. \u201cWhat do <em>you </em>need, Melissa?\u201d He asks. \u201cNew computers, new clothes for everyone, new toys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bribe <em>me, </em>Tony,\u201d she shoots back, using his first name for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me. I owe you a huge favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, believe me. We\u2019re good. The only thing these kids really need is new families. You\u2019ve already done me the biggest favor possible by taking Peter in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can pick him up straight away, right?\u201d Tony asks, eagerly. \u201cI mean \u2013 this thing is effective immediately. Can we just come get him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe usually drive them. Gives them a bit more time to say goodbye down here. I\u2019ll drop him off around six, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Pepper and Tony are waiting by the front door when Melissa turns her car into the driveway. Peter steps out, carrying a larger bag this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d Tony says. He takes the bag from Peter, quickly squeezing his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Pepper steps forward and pulls the boy into a hug. \u201cHey honey,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Peter whispers.</p>\n<p>Pepper shakes Melissa\u2019s hand, invites her in for coffee, but Melissa shakes her head. \u201cWish I could, but I can\u2019t stay away for too long. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be the one dropping him off in the first place, but I wanted to say goodbye.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hugs her, too. \u201cI\u2019ll visit,\u201d he says hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always welcome,\u201d Melissa murmurs. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to. You have a new home. Don\u2019t feel guilty if we drop off your radar. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Pepper takes Peter up to his room to help him get settled. She and Tony have done their best to make the room feel more personal. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to let us know if you want anything different,\u201d Pepper says as she glances around. \u201cTony and I just went with our gut feeling. You can put something in that picture frame. That poster used to be in Tony\u2019s workshop. Oh, and the magnet with the picture of Iron Man on it was Tony\u2019s doing, of course. You can throw it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles a little, but his gaze lingers on the empty picture frame on his nightstand, and Pepper can see a whole range of emotions crossing the boy\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little scary,\u201d Peter admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. For us, too,\u201d Pepper assures him. \u201cNew things are always scary. But we\u2019re also very excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter opens his mouth, then closes it again, looking torn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be excited, too,\u201d Pepper carefully says. \u201cI just wanted you to know how we feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m bumming you out,\u2019 Peter whispers. \u201cI was supposed to be happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not <em>supposed </em>to be anything, Peter,\u201d Pepper says. \u201cYou\u2019re moving into a new situation and it makes you think about everything you\u2019ve lost. That\u2019s normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns to her and leans in for another hug. \u201cThank you,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cYou get me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony enters the room. \u201cHow are we doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d Pepper answers, even as she carefully strokes Peter\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Tony looks eager to get in on the hug, spreading his arms wide and wrapping them around both of them. Pepper chuckles a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy family,\u201d Tony says, and Peter chokes out a sob.</p>\n<p>Tony drops a kiss into his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pete. We know it\u2019s a lot all at once.\u201d He leans back a little to catch a glance at Peter\u2019s face. \u201cDo you want a moment alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter immediately shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you stay with him a little?\u201d Pepper asks Tony. \u201cI\u2019ll go down and see what\u2019s going on for dinner. Any requests, Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head, wiping his eyes. Pepper gives him a final kiss on the forehead before leaving the room.</p>\n<p>Tony lightly squeezes Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWant me to help you with that bag, or would you rather do that yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter slowly moves to his bag that has been placed on his bed, and pulls the zipper down. The first thing he pulls out is a red-and-blue mask that Tony recognizes immediately.</p>\n<p>Peter sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the mask, then up at Tony as if he is trying to convey something, but doesn\u2019t know how.</p>\n<p>\u201cThings are different when you\u2019re in the Spider-Man suit, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Tony ventures.</p>\n<p>Peter clutches the mask a little tighter. \u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get that. Hey, just because we know you are Spider-Man doesn\u2019t mean you suddenly have to start talking your head off, all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns and lies down on the mattress on his back, looking up at Tony. \u201cOf everything I might possibly talk about,\u201d he begins, \u201cmost of it is stuff I either <em>couldn\u2019t </em>talk about or didn\u2019t <em>want </em>to talk about. I got tired of the questions. Stuff like \u2018how are you feeling today?\u2019 or \u2018where were you last night?\u2019. So I stopped talking. And, I don\u2019t know\u2026 Life became a lot easier, so I kept it up. No one has ever known about Spider-Man. <em>No one</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even your parents, or you uncle and aunt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cGot bit after my parents died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, <em>bit?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Peter mutters.</p>\n<p>Tony nods. Just because Peter is speaking in full sentences now, doesn\u2019t mean he is ready to divulge his entire life story. \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he says. \u201cAll in good time. How would you like it if we made you a new suit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up eagerly at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a \u2018yes\u2019. It\u2019ll take a while, so don\u2019t expect it to be done in one week!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have time,\u201d Peter says with a soft smile.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s heart soars. \u201cYes, we do. Want to start straight away?\u201d</p>\n<p>They make their way down to the workshop, where Peter gets to work on something that definitely piques Tony\u2019s interest: his web fluid. Tony leaves his own project on his desk, instead sitting next to Peter\u2019s worktable with his head leaning in his hands, closely monitoring the process. The scrutiny seems to make Peter a little shy, but the kid keeps up his work anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper and I figured you shouldn\u2019t go out patrolling again until this new suit, with all its safety protocols, is up and running. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter replies easily as he mucks about with the chemical substances.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, you have school, homework, dinner, bedtime\u2026 Where does Spider-Man fit in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cDepends on homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough. So, no Spider-Manning until the homework is done, is that your suggestion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Peter replies easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have to set a curfew. I have all your data; I know you go out in the middle of the night from time to time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like to do that,\u201d Peter mutters. \u201cBut you know, in group homes they keep a <em>really </em>close tab on you. Sometimes it\u2019s the only way I get to go out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I definitely don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. How does \u2018back inside at 11 p.m.\u2019 sound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Tony looks him up and down. \u201cI thought you were going to fight me hand and tooth on this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you <em>can</em>, right? If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t agree with, or anything you want differently, you can talk to us about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A short silence. Then: \u201cYou buy the wrong peanut butter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony barks out a surprised laugh. \u201cYeah? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot crunchy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want crunchy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The other Avengers greet Peter enthusiastically at dinner. Wanda even gets a hug in. \u201cHow are you?\u201d She asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cTired,\u201d Peter murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s normal,\u201d Sam pipes up. \u201cYou\u2019ve been experiencing a lot of emotions this week. That drains you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSam\u2019s a therapist,\u201d Tony informs Peter, and Peter immediately shoots Sam a wary look.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Tony continues. \u201cHe\u2019s the good kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam snorts. \u201cIt\u2019s good to keep moving,\u201d he tells Peter. \u201cSteve and I always go for a run in the mornings, maybe you want to join us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s face lights up and he nods.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Tony had never imagined that everyone else would accept Peter so readily into their life. He doesn\u2019t like to give Steve or Sam <em>too </em>much credit, but Peter\u2019s mood seems a lot better the next day. He comes back from the run with a sweaty forehead but a wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cShower?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, funsy. You know where to find everything, right? You have about thirty minutes until you have to leave for school. Happy will drive you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy nods and disappears. Sam flops down in an armchair, leaning his head back and groaning. \u201cWhy did I ever suggest that? Now there\u2019s two of them. You have any idea how fast they run?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a rough estimate, yes,\u201d Tony says, thinking of all the data he has collected on Spider-Man over the past months.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d Sam mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were just messing around today,\u201d Steve says. \u201cHe had fun, didn\u2019t he? But we\u2019ll run at a normal, human pace next time. Promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for letting him tag along,\u201d Tony says. \u201cMeans a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam waves a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s a good kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy is next.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took a long time,\u201d Tony says when Happy and Peter return late that afternoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went for cheesecake,\u201d Happy says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you, now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured I might as well get to know him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grins, holding up two fingers. Tony has noticed he still doesn\u2019t talk a lot when there are people other than Pepper or himself around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean, you ate two whole cheesecakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo pieces,\u201d Happy says. \u201cAnd half of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was nice of you. Thank you,\u201d Tony tells him.</p>\n<p>Happy pats Peter on the back. \u201cWhat can I say, I like this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, Bruce and Rhodey. They prepare pizza for dinner that evening, and invite Peter to help them. Peter mainly takes it upon himself to arrange the ingredients in the most creative way, creating an iron man pizza with red and yellow paprika.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood job, kid,\u201d Tony says when he passes through the kitchen. \u201cYou guys, note how he choose to make an Iron Man pizza, <em>not </em>a Captain America one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo blue,\u201d Peter explains with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After dinner, Peter spends about two hours just looking on with interest while Natasha and Vision sit on the floor next to the coffee table and play chess. After Vision has beaten Natasha for the second time, she raises her eyebrows at Peter. \u201cYou want to see if you can beat an AI in a game of chess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>Natasha chuckles. \u201cFair enough.\u201d She gathers her pieces together. \u201cDon\u2019t you get bored from just watching?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make a good spy one day,\u201d Natasha says which, coming from her, is practically a gold medal.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It is late and the living area is quiet when Peter pads in, already wearing his pajamas. He sits down sideways on the couch next to Tony, drawing his legs up and tucking his toes under Tony\u2019s leg. He is clutching something to his chest. Tony recognizes the empty picture frame that he and Pepper had put on Peter\u2019s nightstand. \u201cYou want to put a picture in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs, looking helpless. Buying the picture frame had just been a triviality to Tony. He and Pepper had bought it along with a few posters, new books and a Rubik\u2019s cube. He should have realized that a picture frame had a much more loaded meaning to Peter who, on the one hand, might be happy to have a reminder of his family members but, on the other hand, might not want to go to sleep and wake up every day with that particular reminder staring back at him from his nightstand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything with it right now,\u201d he suggests. \u201cWe can stuff it in a drawer somewhere. And if you ever want to put any pictures up, just let us know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter slowly nods, leaning in to put the picture frame face-down on a side table.</p>\n<p>Tony reaches out a hand and puts it on Peter\u2019s knee. \u201cHow was today for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Peter says earnestly, and Tony breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cEveryone is nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are, aren\u2019t they? Usually not to me. I guess you bring it out in people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles, looking a little exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re nice, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hums, squeezing Peter\u2019s knee. \u201cMorning jog with Sam and Steve, Cheesecake with Happy, cooking with Bruce and Rhodey\u2026 Are you ready for every day from now on to be as weird as today was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Is that weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s normal. In fact, I believe Happy\u2019s main job is to keep you from secretly sneaking out of a window and taking off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a bad idea, funsy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, at least wait until I\u2019ve left the room before you bail, okay?\u201d Peter asks, his eyes glinting with amusement. \u201cOr Pepper\u2019s gonna blame me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony releases a slow, controlled breath as he tugs at his cufflinks. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTotally lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew you, underoos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re messing up your nicknames,\u201d Peter says, still looking highly amused.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right. Tony generally still sticks to \u2018funsy\u2019 when it\u2019s Peter, and \u2018underoos\u2019 when it\u2019s Spider-Man. But the two haven\u2019t been that different, lately. Spider-Man is a little calmer. Peter is a little more animated, even with other people around.</p>\n<p>Tony remembers the first time Peter uttered a full sentence at Steve, and how ecstatic the man had been about that. As if he\u2019d won the lottery.</p>\n<p>Peter had told Tony on his first day as a foster parent that he had stopped talking because he didn\u2019t want to deal with questions that he wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t answer. When it came to Spider-Man, that problem was easy to solve. All the Avengers knew about Peter\u2019s identity, and it was something they could freely discuss.</p>\n<p>When it comes to everything else, well, it isn\u2019t all as easy. Peter still tends to revert back to his silence when the topic threatens to turn towards anything that reminds him of his family. Tony and Pepper aren\u2019t always sure how to deal with it. They want Peter to be comfortable and do things at his own pace, but don\u2019t want him to push away his feelings. Sam is a major help in all that. And the foster agency training actually helped a little, too. Not a complete waste of time, then.</p>\n<p>He blinks when Peter snaps his fingers. \u201cEarth to Tony? Are you still with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks up, smiles. \u201cJust thinking about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter immediately looks a little flustered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d Tony replies easily.</p>\n<p>Peter turns even redder. \u201cSave it for Pepper, dude,\u201d he says awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough love to go around,\u201d Tony promises.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, too?\u201d Happy asks as he walks in, fussing with his tie.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere he is! The most irresponsible best man ever. I was about to jump out a window, I\u2019ll have you know. Peter had to tackle me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done, Peter,\u201d Happy says, entirely unfazed. \u201cEveryone is ready for you, Tony. In fact, Pepper\u2019s mother is getting impatient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat lady is permanently impatient. She\u2019s like the direct antithesis of Pepper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like her,\u201d Peter staunchly announces.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like everyone,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cAnd everyone likes you. Like one of those Labrador puppies that wants to be petted by everyone and that everyone one wants to pet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re blabbering,\u201d Happy says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s nervous,\u201d Peter explains, patting Tony on the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going,\u201d Happy says. \u201cRhodey didn\u2019t get ordained for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Pepper is wearing a pretty, green dress. She hadn\u2019t wanted to buy a special wedding dress. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spend all that money on something I\u2019ll only wear once,\u201d she had said.</p>\n<p>Tony had pointed out that they ran a billion-dollar company.</p>\n<p>Pepper had pointed out that actually <em>she </em>ran it, and she could wear whatever the hell she wanted <em>thankyouverymuch</em>.</p>\n<p>At which point Tony had given up.</p>\n<p>It is a small wedding. The Avengers are there. And Pepper\u2019s parents. And Peter\u2019s friend Ned. They had set up chairs in the garden behind the compound, and planted enough flowers a few months ago to ensure that they are now surrounded by a sea of bright colors. Rhodey officiates the ceremony. They say everything that needs to be said, and then go on to eating cake which \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 is way more important.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we take a picture together?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cThe three of us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course funsy, c\u2019mere. Bruce \u2013 could you snap one? Someone hold my cake. How does my hair look?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTotally lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The meaning of the picture becomes clear a few days later, when Peter searches Tony out in his workshop and holds something out to him.</p>\n<p>It is the empty picture frame, which is no longer empty. There are three pictures in the frame. A picture of Peter with his parents at the top. A picture of Peter with his uncle and aunt in the middle. And at the bottom is the picture of Tony, Pepper and Peter at the wedding.</p>\n<p>Tony carefully takes it from him to study it closer. \u201cYou want to hang that in your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026?\u201d Peter says, looking up at Tony as if asking for his approval.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m honored to be part of this little list,\u201d Tony says, his eyes scanning all three pictures.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cDon\u2019t die, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to stop being Iron-Man?\u201d Tony asks, dead serious, and in that moment, he is certain that if Peter says \u2018yes\u2019, he will follow through, hang up his suit and that\u2019ll be it. He will just be a dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter murmurs. \u201cYou have to help people. We both do. You didn\u2019t stop me from going out, because you get that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nods. \u201cAnd I\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t die, either,\u201d he says in a slightly more playful tone. \u201cBecause I have plans for you.\u201d He hopes Peter can read the \u2018<em>I love you</em>\u2019 between the lines without getting awkward about it again.</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cI... have plans for you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony chuckles. Message received.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna show them to Pepper,\u201d Peter says, taking his picture frame back and shuffling out.</p>\n<p>Tony turns back to his project: The new Iron Spider Armor, a definite upgrade. The whole world will soon know that Spider-Man is now firmly on team Iron-Man.</p>\n<p>How is <em>that </em>for good publicity?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
