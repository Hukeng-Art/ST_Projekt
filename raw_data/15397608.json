  "text": "<p>Peter knew he was on the brink of sleep. The cloudiness was blocking most of his enhanced senses as well as his thought process. It was keeping him from thinking so much, that he was practically unaware he was aware of these things.</p>\n<p>A sharp and annoying noise kept penetrating the silence. Peter could tell it was a voice, but he couldn\u2019t decipher it. Maybe it was because he didn\u2019t want to in the first place.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it would briefly stop, and Peter would have a moment of peace. But it would always continue right afterwards. The boy willed it to stop, it may have been one of the most annoying sounds Peter had ever heard.</p>\n<p>As the voice continued on, the cloudiness in Peter\u2019s mind slowly seeped away. Peter finally registered all the information he\u2019d been missing in his near sleep.</p>\n<p>That was Mr. Larson\u2019s voice. Oh yeah, that meant he was in chemistry class. This class was so much fun, considering Peter\u2019s conscious state. He tried to fall back asleep as Mr. Larson droned on about something Doctor Banner had taught him a month ago when he was at the tower.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later he could feel Ned nudging him. Peter mentally moaned but didn\u2019t ignore Ned, despite how much he just wanted to go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, you should probably take these notes, Mr. Larson said that it\u2019ll definitely be on the test.\u201d Ned informed him. \u201cAlso, we have homework on this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do this stuff in my sleep, what good would the notes be?\u201d Came Peter\u2019s stubborn reply. He went back to resting his head on his head so he could rest.</p>\n<p>MJ\u2019s snicker interrupted his attempt. \u201cWell you\u2019re practically asleep now, so if you can do it in your sleep as you claim to be able to, then be a good boy and get the homework done now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter opened his mouth to protest, but stopped before words came out. It generally wasn\u2019t the best idea to go against MJ. He grumpily picked up his pencil and lazily worked on the homework.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go, you hobbledehoy.\u201d MJ teased him.</p>\n<p>Peter and Ned both gave her strange looks. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Peter asked her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, you guys are seriously uneducated. It means you\u2019re awkward and gawky, loser.\u201d The girl explained. Peter gave her an offended expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, she got you there.\u201d Ned told him. Peter huffed, deciding to ignore the two for the rest of class.</p>\n<p>Peter noticed MJ reading a new book, which she was already halfway through, and a blank homework packet lying on her desk. He was slightly frustrated at her for being hypocritical, but decided not to mention it to her.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>The bell had finally signaled the end of class, but Mr. Larson told everyone stay in their seats. It was supposedly for an \u201cimportant announcement\u201d. There were several moans and protests, including one from Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext Wednesday our class will have the opportunity to go to Stark Tower!\u201d Mr. Larson announced. With that, the class erupted in excitement, everyone except for Peter and MJ. </p>\n<p>Ned was still bouncing on his feet, even though he\u2019d already been a few times. MJ hadn\u2019t been before, but then again, she also hadn\u2019t wanted to see the Washington Monument on their trip to DC. Peter slept there on the weekends, so for him, he was mostly feeling dread.</p>\n<p>\u201cInformation on what we\u2019ll be touring is on the website for Stark Industries, and I\u2019ll give you all more information closer to Wednesday. The permission slips are on my desk.\u201d Their teacher added on.</p>\n<p>As soon as he said where the permission slips were, most of the class raced over to the desk. It was a mess by the time the three friends got there.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d Peter spoke. MJ shoved a permission slip into his hand at his comment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going.\u201d She simply stated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he has been there a ton of times - \u201d Ned protested in Peter\u2019s favor, only to get cut off by their female counterpart.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going.\u201d She stated again, leaving no room for discussion. MJ quickly left the room, a book in hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m going.\u201d Peter said to Ned. He was not excited to bring this up to May. She would definitely make him go, and she\u2019d probably find it funny that they were going on a field trip to the tower.</p>\n<p>The two boys left the room into the hallway. Their last class of the day was gym. Both Peter and Ned hated it. The class was pointless and took up one of their elective spots. Peter recently decided that he didn\u2019t need the exercise considering what he does in his spare time.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Penis!\u201d Flash shouted from down the hall, \u201cWhat are you going to do when your lies are exposed?\u201d He teased, a smirk on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave me alone Flash.\u201d Peter told him, knowing that it wouldn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody believes that you actually work for Tony Stark. Only your oaf of a friend here does.\u201d Flash continued.</p>\n<p>Anger filled Peter at that comment. He wanted to answer back, but Ned intervened. \u201cLet\u2019s just get to class Peter.\u201d He said, speeding up their pace towards the gym.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Peter,\u201d May started. They were at the table in their apartment. May had come back from Delmar\u2019s to pick up some subs for them to eat. \u201cTell me about this field trip you\u2019re going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stopped chewing for a moment. He was surprised that she already knew about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out about that?\u201d He asked her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMJ called me earlier, saying something about making sure I sign the slip and stuff.\u201d She told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Peter said, wondering if the two talked often. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Stark Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p>May laughed. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t want to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot for a class trip!\u201d Peter told her. \u201cIf Mr. Stark finds out, he\u2019ll just embarrass me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat does seem like something he would do, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d May responded.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, May Parker is calling you.\u201d Tony Stark\u2019s AI informed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut me on, Friday.\u201d He instructed her. He was currently in his lab at the compound, working on installing another parachute into Peter\u2019s suit. \u201cHow\u2019s it going May?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty good, actually.\u201d She began. \u201cApparently Peter is going on a field trip to your tower on Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smirk formed on Tony\u2019s face. \u201cIs he now?\u201d He asked rhetorically. That would be a lot of fun. The kid was really easy to play with.</p>\n<p>May almost seemed to be reading his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass him too much, Tony. I\u2019m the one he\u2019ll come home and complain about the trip to.\u201d She reminded him.</p>\n<p>He supposed he didn\u2019t have to do it too much, he thought with a frown. But there were plenty of others who could, and most of them were at the compound with him. The opportunity was too good to pass.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d He told her, not really sure if he would do it or not. May hung up afterwards.</p>\n<p>Tony quickly finished installing the parachute in the suit. He went to the common floor where the most of the Avengers were relaxing. Steve was sketching in his old WWII notebook, with Sam and Bucky quarreling near him. Wanda and Nat were watching a movie, with a blanket wrapped around the two of them. Clint was sitting on the counter, shoving the cookies that Pepper made that morning into his mouth. Tony knew that Scott was off with his family somewhere, and Bruce was in his lab. Rhodey would be back within the next few hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur Spider-Kid is having a field trip at the tower on Wednesday.\u201d Tony announced to the team. All the faces in the room turned towards him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the day there.\u201d The billionaire added, smiling mischievously.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t, Tony. You wouldn\u2019t want to embarrass Peter in front of his class.\u201d The Capsicle suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d Tony corrected the super soldier.</p>\n<p>Clint seemed to really like his idea. The size of his smirk was unreal. \u201cWe\u2019ll give him one heck of a field trip.\u201d He said.</p>\n<p>The weekend before the field trip had come and gone, and Peter was feeling slightly better about going. He\u2019d checked with Mr. Stark, and none of the Avengers would be at the tower on Wednesday. They would all be at the compound training because they would have a mission the following week.</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark didn\u2019t mention his field trip, so he was assuming that his mentor didn\u2019t know about it. That alone was a miracle in itself. If he did know, it would be a no mercy zone, and no mercy with Iron Man was not fun.</p>\n<p>Peter was hoping that Natasha hadn\u2019t found out either. Nat would be just as bad as Mr. Stark. But he had talked to her over the weekend too, and she didn\u2019t seem to know about it. Then again, she was a spy for years before her identities were exposed.</p>\n<p>Pepper was the only one who would be at the tower. She generally spent a lot more time there than other places. Most of the meetings regarding SI were at the tower, although sometimes she would have to travel.</p>\n<p>With this information, Peter felt that he\u2019d be relatively safe on the field trip. He knew many of the interns who worked at the tower. That would disprove the popular theory that Peter was lying about his internship if he wanted his class to believe him. But since he\u2019d be with his class, he knew they would keep their distance for the day.</p>\n<p>He met up with Ned as he walked to school, Peter\u2019s friend was munching on an almost burnt bagel. They lived on the same block, so they usually walked together. Having their houses so close to each other made it easy to hang out often. MJ\u2019s house was on the other side of Midtown, so normally May would drive Peter if he went to her house.</p>\n<p>Today, Ned was insanely energetic. Actually, it wasn\u2019t much different from the last few days. Peter\u2019s friend wouldn\u2019t stop talking about the trip. He kept getting messages way too early in the morning for Ned, and the only reason he answered was because he was on patrol anyways.</p>\n<p>It was a little overwhelming, having to be with an excited Ned. Yeah, he loved him and all, they\u2019re bros. But it was starting to test Peter\u2019s patience. Half a week was a long time.</p>\n<p>MJ didn\u2019t even help him, she just sat and watched Peter answer question after question like \u201cwhat if...\u201d and \u201cdo you think...\u201d She always had some sort of book, and Ned would start spewing questions. So MJ would just smirk into her book, pretending like she wasn\u2019t seeing any of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll get to meet Iron Man?\u201d The interrogation began.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already met him, Ned.\u201d Peter pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s so cool. You\u2019re really lucky you get to spend so much time with him. Hey, do you think if I could remake the experimental spider and let it bite me, that I\u2019d get powers too? Do you think Tony Stark would make me a suit?\u201d Rambled the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. I don\u2019t know, Ned. Maybe.\u201d Peter replied, not exactly sure how to answer those questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would happen if you have kids? Would they have powers like you? What if something happened in the womb and they grew eight legs?\u201d At this point Peter wasn\u2019t even listening.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have super strength right? How much can you lift? Do you think you can lift more than Captain America? Can you break his shield? I heard it\u2019s made out if vibranium. Can you break vibranium? Does that mean you could break the Winter Soldier\u2019s arm? It\u2019s made out of vibranium too, right?\u201d Ned paused to take a bite of his bagel. Peter wasn\u2019t even sure if he swallowed before he began talking again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much vibranium do you think they keep in Wakanda? I heard that all their structures are made of it. Is Black Panther\u2019s suit made of vibranium? I heard that his sister makes all of his tech. Do you think she\u2019ll be like the next Tony Stark? I wonder if she\u2019s hot.\u201d Peter almost missed a step when he heard the last question.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a princess, she must be. Do you think if the situation popped up that she would date me? I bet she would date you, I mean, you\u2019ve got abs man.\u201d That was slightly freaky. Since when had Ned seen him with his shirt off?</p>\n<p>\u201cI already have a girlfriend, Ned. I think if I traded MJ for a princess, MJ would find a way for me to have a slow and painful death.\u201d Peter told him. How does he come up with these?</p>\n<p>\u201cGood point. We should probably try to avoid that.\u201d Peter\u2019s friend pointed out the obvious.</p>\n<p>The crazy scenarios stopped as the two arrived at Midtown. The ugly yellow school bus that was supposed to take them to Stark Tower was already waiting by the front. Their trip was for the whole day, so they were supposed to leave in a few minutes. Most of their classmates were already waiting on the bus.</p>\n<p>Mr. Larson was collecting permission slips by the doors to the bus. It took Ned about a quarter of a second to get his out. Peter, on the other hand, had to dig through the depths of his bag, and handed the crumpled and ripped sheet to his teacher. Mr. Larson looked at it in disgust, probably because of the ketchup stain that was on it.</p>\n<p>Peter and Ned joined MJ in the back of the bus. Somehow the last few seats had stayed open. Peter\u2019s guess was that MJ had a big part in keeping the section clear for them. He knew that MJ\u2019s glare could work wonders. Maybe he should learn to do that himself. Or better yet, ask Mr. Stark to put it into his suit. Interrogation mode hadn\u2019t quite done the trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou losers were almost late.\u201d MJ told them, keeping her gaze on the book she was reading. It was a different book than yesterday, Peter noted. Yesterday\u2019s book had been different from the day before too. It wasn\u2019t surprising considering how much the girl read.</p>\n<p>Peter also noticed that MJ was carrying her \u201ccrisis notebook\u201d with her. MJ had show him the sketch of the teacher who watched the students in detention. Peter had just ditched it and the sketch showed his reaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I should have left later.\u201d Peter mumbled. Maybe then he could have missed the bus.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that I heard?\u201d MJ asked him. Her voice warned him to be careful of his next words.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said that it would have been a shame.\u201d Corrected the teen. It was practically dripping sarcasm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Was MJ\u2019s reply. She seemed to ignore the fact that it was completely sarcastic.</p>\n<p>The bus began its trip to Stark Tower. The majority of the class was talking about the tour they\u2019d be getting. Ned kept asking silly questions, and MJ continued reading her book. Then there were the loud and obnoxious people who made everyone want to rip their ears off. Namely, Flash and his clique. So, the volume on the bus was nearly as high as the tower they were going to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo Penis! Can you introduce me to Tony Stark?\u201d Flash teased Peter. \u201cOh wait, you don\u2019t even know him. My bad!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chose to ignore the taunting and waited for Ned to ask another question. His friend didn\u2019t seem to get the memo because none came.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard your girlfriend is forcing you to come. Are you scared, Penis?\u201d Flash went on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could just die right here.\u201d Peter muttered under his breath in embarrassment. Only Ned and MJ should have heard him. They were sitting closest to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, do you think lovely Michelle will follow you in her grief?\u201d Flash said, snickering.</p>\n<p>Peter was taken back by Flash\u2019s comment. Usually he left MJ alone. Bothering him alone was one thing. But bringing his girlfriend into it was a whole other story. Peter was about to have a few words with Flash until MJ beat him to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFlash, if I wanted to die, I would climb up your ego and jump down to your IQ level.\u201d She told him, giving Flash her evil glare. The bus suddenly became very quiet, and most eyes were on MJ and Flash. What a solid burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you make a comment like that again, I\u2019ll add some color to your pasty face.\u201d MJ added on. Peter knew she was tough, but he did not know that she was the supreme master of roasting.</p>\n<p>It seemed there was already more color on his face than there originally was. An embarrassed blush was consuming his whole face. He looked like a ripe tomato, ready for harvesting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Flash squeaked out, making his way to the seat he was in earlier. The rest of their class fell back into chatter, although more quiet this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had to wait until now to pull that one out?\u201d Peter questioned MJ jokingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to wait for the right moment. I\u2019ve been waiting for this opportunity for months.\u201d She informed him. A smirk was creeping up her face.</p>\n<p>She folded the corner of a page in her book and shut it. MJ opened her \u201ccrisis notebook\u201d and took out a pencil. She noticed Ned and Peter watching her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw his face, right? It deserves a special place in here for safekeeping and blackmail purposes.\u201d Said MJ. She began scribbling in the notebook. Peter would have to see it when she finished. Generally her sketches were pretty accurate.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Tony walked into the kitchen, where Steve was making breakfast. He and Nat were the only Avengers who could actually cook. Steve was the only one who ever made the food though, because you\u2019d be caught dead before you saw Nat cooking. Tony knew, it had almost happened once.</p>\n<p>Most of the team was still asleep. He noticed Wanda on the couch, fiddling with her earbuds as she listened to music. Tony hoped it wasn\u2019t rap, he couldn\u2019t stand that style of music. Clint was once again sitting on the counter, legs swinging back and forth like a child. He was drinking Tony\u2019s coffee right from the pot.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you maybe not drink all of the coffee that I asked Friday to brew?\u201d The billionaire asked, clearly annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, as Cap likes to say, the early bird gets the worm, Tony.\u201d Came the archer\u2019s reply, taking another sip from the pot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was working on Peter\u2019s suit before you woke up.\u201d Tony grumbled at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point. I was here first, so I get the coffee.\u201d Clint told Tony, taking another gulp of the caffeinated drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Legolas.\u201d Tony started. \u201cFriday.\u201d The man qued.</p>\n<p>Almost instantly, the lid to the pot shut, and the pot zoomed back over to the coffee maker. Clint appeared to be shocked. Cap looked over from the stove to see what happened. They both looked confused. Wanda didn\u2019t seem to notice anything, the music likely blocking the rest of the world out.</p>\n<p>\u201cMagnets can work wonders.\u201d Tony simply stated. A smug smile formed on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you add that?\u201d Clint protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince this became a daily occurrence, you thief.\u201d Accused the billionaire. Tony dumped out the coffee in the pot since it was contaminated by Clint, and made himself some new coffee. Clint\u2019s also probably had a ton of sweeteners in it, gross. Tony liked it bitter.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do I say, \u2018the early bird gets the worm?\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never said that in my life.\u201d Steve asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou old people say that sort if stuff all the time. I\u2019m sure you used to, back in your day.\u201d Clint explained to the super soldier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure it was ever said before my plane crashed.\u201d He argued.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, Sir, the first recording of that phrase was by John Ray in the late 17th century. He said \u2018The early bird catcheth the worm.\u2019\u201d Friday announced. Steve had a defeated look on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just uneducated, Cap.\u201d Suggested Clint.</p>\n<p>As Steve finished cooking their breakfast, more members of the team came in. He made omelettes, and there was cheese oozing out the sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre any of you going to vote today?\u201d Wanda asked the group in attempt to start a conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I hate politics. Plus, researching each person is boring. I have suits to build, a company to run.\u201d Tony said.</p>\n<p>Steve looked nearly horrified. \u201cBut voting is important! Every vote counts, it could be the difference between who wins, Tony.\u201d The patriotic man lectured.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t have time for that stuff. Also, since when has an election ever come down to one person\u2019s vote?\u201d Explained Tony.</p>\n<p>Steve looked a little put back. He couldn\u2019t think of any, and he hadn\u2019t caught up on much politics since coming out of the ice. Determination was evident in Cap\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should appreciate that you even have the right to vote! It took generations for some Americans to be allowed to vote. Some people in other countries still don\u2019t have that right!\u201d The righteous man told them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate it, I just don\u2019t use it.\u201d Replied Tony with his \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d attitude.</p>\n<p>Steve looked mad at this point. It really ticked him off when people weren\u2019t thankful or appreciative of what they have. Steve fought so many battles in one of the biggest wars in history in order for people to keep these rights! It wasn\u2019t fair!</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a walk.\u201d Cap announced to the group. He got out of his seat at the table and walked towards the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Pete was trying to convince people to vote for President Ellis again. He should be downstairs. Why don\u2019t you talk to him about it?\u201d Suggested Clint.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I will!\u201d Cap said, not turning to look back as he stepped in the elevator.</p>\n<p>As soon as the doors shut, Clint and Tony high fived. Wanda was fruitlessly trying to hide a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCap won\u2019t be very happy when he finds out you two set him up.\u201d Wanda pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well he wasn\u2019t going to meet up with Peter intentionally. Distracting him from thinking why the kid is here was the only way to do it.\u201d Clint explained to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like the idea of embarrassing Peter.\u201d Wanda stated. She knew that it would happen anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said before, he\u2019s going to have one heck of a field trip.\u201d Clint repeated from the week before.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>The bus finally pulled up at Stark Tower. It dropped them off at the front, the same place they would be picked up in a few hours. There was only one other school group there. Everyone else worked there.</p>\n<p>The entrance area was big and grand. It had Tony Stark written all over it. The floor was covered in marble tile, and many of the walls were completely made of glass. The ceiling was at least three stories high. The whole class, especially Ned, was amazed. Peter couldn\u2019t appreciate it the same way, he was just used to it by now.</p>\n<p>Their teacher led them towards the check in desk. A tour guide was waiting there for them, and she was holding their badges. Peter recognized her. Katelyn was one of SI\u2019s interns. She was blonde and short, but well built. Peter knew that she was on her school\u2019s crew team.</p>\n<p>Katelyn smiled at the group when they arrived. \u201cHello Midtown High! My name is Katelyn, and I will be leading you on your tour today.\u201d She said sweetly.</p>\n<p>Katelyn started talking about some the history of SI. Peter wasn\u2019t listening. The elevator doors had opened, and someone who wasn\u2019t supposed to be here came out. He wasn\u2019t recognizable at first glance, but if you looked past the baseball cap and the large sunglasses, you would recognize him.</p>\n<p>Peter was a little scared now. Mr. Stark had told him that none of the Avengers would be at the tower today, and yet, there was Captain America. That meant that Mr. Stark must be planning to do something with his class. It could be that it was a last minute decision and had nothing to do with his trip. Or maybe it was just Steve at the tower.</p>\n<p>Cap appeared to be looking for something or someone in particular. Peter really hoped that it wasn\u2019t him. The soldier walked around some more and searched, until he spotted Peter. Great, luck was on his side today.</p>\n<p>Steve approached him, keeping his head low so that he wouldn\u2019t be recognized. Peter shifted away from his group so that hopefully they wouldn\u2019t see him with Steve. Only MJ seemed to notice that Peter was drifting from the group.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Peter, I heard that you\u2019re supporting President Ellis in getting re-elected.\u201d Steve said.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, well, not really. But I\u2019d be happy if he did get elected again I guess.\u201d Peter replied, a little confused on Cap\u2019s choice of topic.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Tony was just telling me about it.\u201d Steve told him, clearly confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean that Mr. Stark is here, in the tower?\u201d An alarmed Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s in the penthouse. I thought you\u2019d be happy about\u2026\u201d Cap drifted off as he noticed Peter\u2019s class. \u201cOh yeah, you have a field trip.\u201d Steve finished, realizing why the kid seemed so freaked out.</p>\n<p>Most of the group noticed him by now, and there were whispers of \u201cThat looks like Captain America!\u201d Peter looked panicked, almost like a deer caught in headlights.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Peter, Tony and Clint must have tricked me into coming down here just to talk to you.\u201d Steve told him, looking genuinely upset on the boy\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not your fault if they tricked you.\u201d Peter paused. \u201cDoes this mean that Mr. Stark and Clint are planning something for today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019m not sure what, but there\u2019s definitely something coming.\u201d The super soldier confirmed. Peter shivered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go and scold Tony and Clint now.\u201d Steve said to Peter. \u201cMaybe I can convince them to stay away from your group. Try to have some fun and don\u2019t worry about those two too much.\u201d Added Steve in attempt to help Peter not worry so much.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t work well, the kid was still nervous. But he did appreciate Cap\u2019s effort. He would try to stop thinking about it, because he really wanted to relax and enjoy the tour. Peter wouldn\u2019t have to stay on guard too much because his spider sense would warn him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. See you later, Steve.\u201d Peter replied, speaking softly so his class couldn\u2019t hear. The older man left, leaving Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter awkwardly walked back over to his class. Some of the students were gaping at him, having recognized the man he was talking to. Flash seemed to be among them, but also denying what he saw. Others looked confused. And then there was one who didn\u2019t seem to care. That was MJ. She was reading her book again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then! Let me hand out your badges.\u201d Katelyn started in her super cheery voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know your names, so just come up when I call you. Becky Anderson.\u201d One by one each person grabbed their badge.</p>\n<p>As this happened, Flash approached him. Peter mentally groaned. He just never stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was that, Penis? You\u2019ve got some people fooled into thinking it\u2019s actually Captain America.\u201d Flash confronted the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of my friends. We see each other on the weekends a lot.\u201d Peter told him truthfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why was he here? Don\u2019t try and tell me it\u2019s because he works with you, Penis. You can\u2019t trick me with that lie.\u201d Flash questioned him. Peter panicked, he didn't want to tell Flash who it was, but he was running out of options. And technically, everything Flash had just told him not to tell him was true. Peter, as Spider-Man, worked with Steve on missions occasionally.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe works with Mr. Stark, and I see him during my internship.\u201d Peter explained.</p>\n<p>Flash still didn't believe he was telling the truth. His eyes were narrowing at Peter suspiciously. Flash opened his mouth to say something else, probably another accusation, when his name was called for his badge. Peter saw Katelyn give Flash the stink eye as she handed his card to him. She must have seen what was going on.</p>\n<p>Peter took the opportunity to escape back to his friends. They already had their badges since they were being called out in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, was that really-\u201d Ned started rambling excitingly. Peter cut him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNed, quiet! I don\u2019t want people to know about that.\u201d The boy urgently whispered to his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it is? Dude, you have got to introduce me.\u201d Expressed Ned at a much lower volume. His eyes wide in amazement.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure Ned, maybe some other time.\u201d Peter assured his friend.</p>\n<p>Ned directed his attention towards his temporary badge. He seemed to soak in every little detail that was there. Peter didn\u2019t understand why Ned found it so amazing, but apparently it was to him.</p>\n<p>They had the person\u2019s name on it with a picture and the Stark Industries logo. At the top, there was a colored bar with the person\u2019s status. For their class, the bar was yellow, and the status was Delta.</p>\n<p>Peter took his badge out of his bag. One of the security measures of the tower was that each person was only allowed one badge. So Peter could not get a separate one for the field trip. He just hoped nobody noticed.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s looked different. It still had his name, picture, and the logo. However, the bar color and status were different. The bar was purple and the status was Alpha. This gave him access to every part of the tower.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of your badges should look the same, but we actually have a wide variety of badges.\u201d Their tour guide started explaining. \u201cThere are four major status classifications. There\u2019s Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, with Alpha as the highest and Delta as the lowest. Within those classifications are four others. These are determined by the color of the bar on you badge. There\u2019s purple, blue, green, and yellow, with purple as the highest and yellow as the lowest.\u201d Katelyn taught them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelta is usually for our manufacturers and our tour groups. Gamma is for the engineers, scientists, and techs. Beta is for some of the higher ups who help run the company. If Pepper Potts, our CEO, was only CEO, then she would be a Beta purple. But, she is also the personal assistant and fianc\u00e9e of Tony Stark, so she is an Alpha purple. Alpha gives someone access to the penthouse section of the tower. All of the Avengers have Alpha badges. Some, like Ant-Man and Black Panther, don\u2019t stay very often, so they would have Alpha yellow. Alpha purples are the only ones who have access to the entire tower.\u201d Katelyn went on.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow we will make our way to the manufacturing section of the tower, which is more interesting than it sounds.\u201d Katelyn smiled sweetly and led them away from the glamorous entrance area.</p>\n<p>Ned was practically dancing as they walked down the long hallway. He kept looking down at his badge in awe. MJ was using hers as a bookmark. She wasn\u2019t actually reading at the moment, and was enjoying the atmosphere of the tower.</p>\n<p>Peter felt his spider sense prickle before his badge was snatched out of his hand. He quickly turned around to find Flash, with Peter\u2019s badge in his grasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is your badge different, Penis? Did you steal it?\u201d Flash accused him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Give it back, Flash.\u201d Peter protested, reaching for the card.</p>\n<p>Flash moved it out of the other boy\u2019s reach. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Parker. You\u2019re not getting this back until you admit you stole it.\u201d He teased him. Peter kept trying to reach for the card, and Flash kept moving it out of the way.</p>\n<p>MJ walked up behind Flash and plucked it right out of his hand. She wasn\u2019t even trying to be discreet about it, and Flash still hadn\u2019t noticed. Even without his spider sense, Peter would have seen that coming.</p>\n<p>His girlfriend looked at the card. \u201cIt has his picture on it.\u201d She simply stated. MJ flipped the card back around to show Flash, still keeping it out of his reach. Her eyebrows were raised in annoyance. She handed the badge back to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what if he hacked-\u201d Flash started saying before he was cut off.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs smart as Peter is, he would not be able to hack Tony Stark\u2019s security system. He makes it so that no one can.\u201d MJ interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re on decathlon, Flash. You should be able to figure this one out.\u201d</p>\n<p>MJ waited for his reply but none came. \u201cAre you having trouble? Let me help you. That is Peter\u2019s real badge.\u201d She said the last sentence slowly and emphasized each word. There was still no response from Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, say it with me.\u201d MJ waited until Flash started saying it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is Peter\u2019s real badge.\u201d They two said simultaneously. Each word was emphasized and slow, just like MJ said it the first time. Flash grumbled as he said it, clearly only doing it because of MJ\u2019s threat from the bus earlier.</p>\n<p>They finally arrived at the manufacturing stations, and Flash left. They all had to swipe their badges to get in. Katelyn led them around while talking about what was going on and what they were seeing. Peter had never been to this part of the tower, so it was actually pretty cool to look around and learn the little parts of SI that he didn\u2019t already know. MJ stuck closer to Peter, just in case Flash wanted to be annoying again. As for Ned, well, we can all guess how he was reacting.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>The doors to the elevator in the penthouse dinged. Steve walked out, looking quite ticked off. There was nobody in the kitchen area, where Cap thought Tony and Clint would be. Several plates were in the sink, so they probably already finished eating.</p>\n<p>However, when he checked the living room, almost everyone was there. Clint, Sam, and Wanda were playing Mario Kart on the TV with the fancy steering wheel handles you can put on the wii remote. If there weren\u2019t numbers indicating which place they were in on the screen, Steve would have thought they were all tied.</p>\n<p>Nat was sitting on the couch, sipping what appeared to be hot chocolate. She was sitting with one leg folded on top of the other, and she still had her pink Black Widow pajamas on. Bruce was on his Starkpad, most likely reading some classic novel that came out after Steve\u2019s time. Rhodey was on the opposite side of the couch Nat was on, and was dozing off. He must have gotten back really late the night before. Bucky was lazily reading the news and looked up when Steve came in.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou good, Steve?\u201d His friend asked, clearly noticing his ticked off expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, he\u2019s not.\u201d The archer answered for him as he was opening his mouth to reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right I\u2019m not!\u201d Confirmed the soldier harshly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage!\u201d Everyone in the room said at once. No one stopped what they were doing or looked at him as they said it. Even Banner had taken part in it, a tiny smirk was evident on his face.</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Stark?\u201d He demanded. Steve decided to leave Clint alone for the time being. Tony was the brains of the duo, so he was probably the one who came up with idea to trick him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere else but his lab?\u201d Wanda pointed out. She was right, Tony was always down there doing something with the suits. He should have thought to check there first.</p>\n<p>As he was leaving the room, he heard lots of shouting. Most of them were protests, but one of them sounded victorious. A glance at the TV screen showed that Sam, who played as Donkey Kong, had placed first.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Take an L, suckers!\u201d Sam shouted to Clint and Wanda.</p>\n<p>When Steve opened the glass doors to Tony\u2019s lab, the music wasn\u2019t as loud as he expected. Usually it was blaring on possibly the highest volume, but now is was soft enough to be background noise. He heard another voice in the room, so he figured it was probably because he was talking to someone.</p>\n<p>He was right, Tony was talking to Pepper. The latter was facing his direction and smiled when she noticed him. He politely nodded to her in acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>He took advantage in the pause in their conversation to speak. \u201cThat was rude, Stark.\u201d Cap scolded. Pepper gave her fianc\u00e9 a pointed look.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony, what did you do?\u201d She said in an accusing tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust telling Capsicle that I wasn\u2019t going to vote today.\u201d The man told her. He wasn\u2019t telling the whole truth, and Pepper could definitely tell.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tricking me into embarrassing Peter in front of his class!\u201d Steve added.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony!\u201d Pepper exclaimed. \u201cI thought May told you not to do that!\u201d The woman reminded him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know about that? Were you listening to my calls again?\u201d Tony expressed his curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow else am I supposed to keep you in line?\u201d Pepper declared.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no sense of privacy, Pep.\u201d The billionaire claimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe share a room.\u201d She kindly reminded her soon to be husband.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d He murmured.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>The class had finished touring the manufacturing section, and was walking towards their next destination. Katelyn hadn\u2019t told them what it was yet, but said it would be pretty cool. The technology that was used to make SI\u2019s products had been more interesting than it sounded, just as Katelyn promised.</p>\n<p>One of the men that worked in that department had told them about his job and what a normal day for him was. It sounded like a lot of lifting and moving things around. The man also showed them all the power tools he used on a daily basis. There was also a lot that the machines did for them.</p>\n<p>Right now, they were walking down another hallway that looked similar to the one from earlier. Peter knew that most of the hallways on the first floor looked this way.</p>\n<p>They reached another door, this one made of glass. The surrounding walls were also made of glass and curved around the place they were looking at. On the other side was a grassy area surrounded by tall walls. The top of the walls weren\u2019t visible, so you couldn\u2019t tell if there was a roof, but there was sunlight streaming in, so there must not be one.</p>\n<p>In the center was a large circular shape with a strange looking pattern inside. Where the pattern was, there wasn\u2019t any grass. The mini lawn looked freshly mowed, and Peter felt sympathetic for whoever had the job if mowing the tiny place.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe place you\u2019re looking at now is where the Thor comes to earth. When they get here, a lot of pressure is put on the ground, and would collapse the tower if it were on a higher floor. Mr. Stark also didn\u2019t want the print engraved every time Thor came to visit, so he made a place just for that purpose.\u201d Katelyn educated them.</p>\n<p>Murmurs of incredulity rippled through cluster of students. It was very fascinating to look at. Peter had never really thought about how Thor got to Midguard, as he called it. He\u2019d always just seen him enter through the elevator doors.</p>\n<p>Ned\u2019s mouth dropped open, and his jaw was hanging low. He was gaping like a fish with his eyes wide open.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch flies, Ned.\u201d MJ warned him. He shut his mouth, but his eyes were still bulging.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not have authorized access to this space, but feel free to take a look.\u201d Katelyn let them know.</p>\n<p>Ned ran up to one of the walls and pressed his hands and face against it. He looked like a little kid at an aquarium.</p>\n<p>MJ took out her phone and snapped a few pictures. She pocketed her phone when she got too frustrated from the glare that the glass was reflecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, if you\u2019ll all follow me this way-\u201d Katelyn started as she led the class in a different direction. She was interrupted by a flash of lightning and booming thunder that shook the whole building. It had come in the direction of the area they had just come from. Peter felt his spider sense tingle.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity, the group made their way back to the miniature courtyard. Standing there was Thor and Loki. The tour group erupted into whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you kindly remind me why we\u2019re here, brother?\u201d Loki asked Thor as they stepped into the hallway. Thor was dressed in casual clothing with an umbrella rather than his armor and cape, and Loki was dressed in a suit in his attempt to dress like a normal Midguardian. Most people seemed a little wary of Loki, recognizing him from the Battle of New York a few years ago. All eyes were on them, and they didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was told by Stark that there was an emergency at the tower, but I do not see any problems as of yet.\u201d Thor answered. The muscular Asguardian finally spotted Peter.</p>\n<p>A wide smile graced the man\u2019s face. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t for mini Stark! What a pleasure to see you!\u201d Thor walked towards him and gave him a hug. It would have been bone crushing if not for Peter\u2019s super strength. The boy grimaced at the nickname the older man had given him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not aware that Stark had a son.\u201d Loki announced. Peter\u2019s eyes went wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no! I\u2019m not his son, Mr. Loki, I\u2019m just his intern.\u201d The boy corrected the trickster. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh! My apologies Peter. I was under the impression that you and Stark were related!\u201d Thor informed him. The man let out a thunderous laugh. Peter stayed silent, fully aware of the eyes that were watching him. Thor seemed to notice his uncomfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He asked, concern in his expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, nothing, Mr. Thor. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Assured Peter. Thor didn\u2019t seem to buy it. He finally noticed the group near them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know these young Midguardians?\u201d The muscular man inquired.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes. I do. They\u2019re in my chemistry class from school.\u201d Peter answered. A beaming smile spread across Thor\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful! Would you all like to see the Avenger\u2019s personal training room? I can show you my hammer.\u201d Thor asked, facing the entire group as he spoke.</p>\n<p>Loud shouts of \u201cYes!\u201d were heard, finalizing the decision. Peter didn\u2019t like this idea at all. But, when Thor had a crazy idea, there was no stopping him. Besides, at least all the attention wasn\u2019t on him anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, but these people do not have access to the higher floors, including the training room.\u201d Katelyn informed him.</p>\n<p>Thor stopped to think for a moment, before his face brightened again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I can swipe them all in!\u201d The man resolved the conflict. He pulled out his own badge, which was an Alpha purple.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is against many of the security policies.\u201d Their tour guide protested again. Peter felt bad for her, she was just trying to do her job.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the Man of Iron won\u2019t mind.\u201d Thor told her, fully convinced he was right. He lead the group towards the main elevator, and they somehow fit the whole class inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother, even burning Asgard to the ground was a better idea than this.\u201d The trickster reprimanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, Thor and Loki have arrived at the tower.\u201d Friday informed Tony. The man smiled. \u201cThey are bringing the Midtown Science tour group to the training room.\u201d The AI added on.</p>\n<p>The genius\u2019s smile faltered slightly, that part hadn\u2019t exactly been part of the plan. Tony was supposed to meet Asgardian down there, and then they would go find Peter. He supposed he would just have to change the plan. Easy peasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold up the elevator, Fri.\u201d Tony instructed. He headed towards the door to his lab at a quick pace. Pepper caught him before he could leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d She challenged him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe living room. I\u2019ve got to talk to Nat and Wanda.\u201d He told her. She narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re not going downstairs to talk to Peter.\u201d Pepper said. \u201cOr trick someone into doing it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t even considering it.\u201d Tony promised. He quickly left the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Tony!\u201d He heard his fianc\u00e9e yell from his lab.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t been lying. He wasn\u2019t going to talk to Peter and he wasn\u2019t going to trick anyone into doing it for him. However, he knew some people who would do it without convincing.</p>\n<p>Tony went to the living room where he assumed the two Avengers would be. He was right. Natasha was playing Mario Kart with Sam and Clint. She was creaming them. Tony saw about a dozen banana peels and koopa shells bouncing around the track. Every few seconds, Sam or Clint would crash into one. Nat was on her third lap while the other two were somewhere on their first. Wanda was sitting on the sofa, laughing at the two men struggle and fail.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for criticizing the gaming skills of women.\u201d Nat told them as Yoshi finished in first. Wanda started another round of laughing fits. The bird themed heroes hung their heads in shame, muttering about it not being fair. Yoshi was jumping in his vehicle, pumping his fist in the air. Donkey Kong shook his head in disbelief, and Baby Peach cried and had a mini tantrum.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhase three, Plan C.\u201d Tony said aloud. The four heads in the room whipped around to look at him. Nat and Wanda glared at him for interrupting, but obliged and headed towards the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u201cThor\u2019s already in there with Pete\u2019s whole class, you\u2019re going to have to use the stairs.\u201d He told them. They both looked fairly annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's seventeen flights, Tony.\u201d Wanda complained. She looked more like a teenager when she did that.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's not really my problem.\u201d The billionaire replied. Wanda moaned, and then followed Natasha down the staircase. \u201cAnd you better hurry up! I stopped the elevator to buy you some time, but there\u2019s a ton of people in there.\u201d Tony yelled after them. Technically, Wanda could make her and Nat fly down using her magic, but he would let them figure it out themselves.</p>\n<p>After being defeated in Mario Kart, Clint and Sam switched to Wii Sports Resort. They were in the middle of a dogfight, and Sam was down by a few balloons. Tony left as Sam\u2019s Mii chased Clint\u2019s Mii into the volcano.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn't have taken just one day off from being an idiot, now could you?\u201d Loki scolded his brother. \u201cStark told you there was an emergency, and now we're stuck in this elevator with thirty little children with no way to get out! \u2018Get help\u2019 won't help us like it did last time, brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so it's my fault now? Wasn't it your grand idea to have a blue glowing cube control everyone's mind?\u201d Thor accused his brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it was your idea to attack the frost giants and start a war.\u201d Loki reminded Thor in return.</p>\n<p>The Asgardian brothers continued to argue, their voices rising as they went on. Peter wished they would be quieter. He was squished between the two men, and with his enhanced senses, it sounded like they were shouting. Peter didn\u2019t want to go into sensory overload. Especially not in front of his class.</p>\n<p>A few minutes earlier, the elevator had stopped moving on their way to the training room. That meant that about thirty students, an intern, a teacher, and two Asgardians were huddled in an unmoving elevator. It was not the most preferable situation to be in, although Ned was freaking out about being squished against the other side of Thor. If it weren\u2019t for their argument, you\u2019d probably be able to hear him squealing.</p>\n<p>Nearly all of the students were watching the siblings fight. Their insults were hilarious and hard hitting, even if they didn\u2019t understand most of them. The tension that was present around Loki at first was almost all gone now that people were seeing the other side of him.</p>\n<p>Peter had watched MJ pull out the \u201ccrisis notebook\u201d again. Based on the way she frequently looked from Loki back to the paper, she was probably sketching the black haired god.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy outfit looks outrageous? You\u2019re the one dressed like a witch! You\u2019re like Parry Hotter!\u201d Thor boomed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the nine realms is Parry Hotter? I don\u2019t think you know anything you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Loki argued back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I know what I\u2019m talking about! I\u2019m not an idiot!\u201d Defended the Asgardian.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother, if I agreed with you, then we\u2019d both be wrong. You\u2019re the one who got us stuck here in the first place!\u201d Quipped Loki.</p>\n<p>As Thor opened his mouth to yell back, the elevator started moving again with a jolt. Peter was thankful that nobody was yelling in his ears anymore. The rest of the class grew excited again, now that they weren\u2019t stuck.</p>\n<p>Thor smiled a beaming smile. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s a problem anymore, now does it, brother?\u201d Thor asked Loki, thinking he won the argument. Loki just rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>The anti-gravitational feeling simmered away as the elevator slowed to a stop. The doors slid open and the class exited, with the Asgardians in the lead.</p>\n<p>There was a hallway with one solid wall, and one glass wall. On the other side of the glass was the training room, judging by the equipment. The glass wall was in place for safety reasons so that someone in the hallway wouldn't get hurt. The lights weren\u2019t as bright, and it created a softer atmosphere. This room didn\u2019t scream billionaire like the first floor did.</p>\n<p>Katelyn\u2019s reaction would have made Peter laugh if it weren\u2019t for the situation he was in. The intern didn\u2019t have access to this part of the tower, just like the rest of the group, so her expressions were similar to the class she was supposed to be guiding.</p>\n<p>Ned looked ready to break the glass wall separating the hallway from the training room in his excitement. At this point, Peter wasn\u2019t at all surprised. MJ was taking in the place around her, but her face didn\u2019t reveal her thoughts to Peter. The rest of the class had expressions of awe.</p>\n<p>In the center of the training room was a large mat. All the other equipment was pushed to the side against the three walls that weren\u2019t glass. Black Widow and Scarlet Witch were fighting in the center.</p>\n<p>Peter would have called it sparring, considering that\u2019s what Nat usually did for her training, but it wasn\u2019t. Wanda was using her magic to fight Natasha, so they really had no contact at all. The assassin dodged things that were being thrown at her, and sometimes threw them back.</p>\n<p>They were moving at high speeds, so it was really hard to follow what was going on. This just made it more admirable. The two just seemed to move in rhythm, falling in the right places at the right times. Even Peter, who already trained with these two women, wished he could do that.</p>\n<p>The whole group was watching against the glass wall from the hallway. MJ looked impressed, which was a strange look on her.</p>\n<p>Thor, still with his beaming smile, entered the arena without thought. Loki followed him, looking slightly hesitant on whether he should enter or not. Despite the hesitation, he still held his aura of confidence.</p>\n<p>The ruler of the nine realms approached the two women. He got hit in the face with the tail of one of the arrows Wanda was launching at Nat. It clearly startled him. Thor was not close enough to the mat to get hit, so it was likely done on purpose.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops.\u201d Wanda said with a boring tone and a mundane expression. \u201cMy bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor quickly recovered from the surprise. \u201cDo not worry, I was not harmed.\u201d He assured Wanda.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one is going to worry about you, brother.\u201d Loki told him.</p>\n<p>Wanda finally stopped aiming objects as Natasha. She looked at the tour group, and then at Thor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you bring children in here? You do know we sometimes throw knives, right?\u201d Wanda questioned the Asgardian with a disapproving look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought they might want to see my hammer! And how did you know it was my idea and not my brother\u2019s?\u201d Thor answered her.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Loki at least knows a good idea from a bad one.\u201d Nat explained to him. Loki smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s right you know.\u201d He added on. Thor appeared to disagree with the popular opinion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, now I will show you all my hammer!\u201d Thor boomed, facing back to Peter\u2019s class as he spoke. The god flipped his umbrella in the air, and when it landed back in his hand, it was his famous hammer.</p>\n<p>The class stared in amazement. Nobody there had ever seen anything like it. Even Peter, who had briefly met Thor a few months earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody wants to see your boring hammer.\u201d Loki harshly told him. Thor looked like a kicked puppy. He looked like his brother had shattered his dreams.</p>\n<p>There were many mumbled protests to Loki\u2019s statement. No one in the class was brave enough to openly disagree with the trickster.</p>\n<p>Thor was ready to protest when Natasha spoke up. \u201cWe could show them Wanda\u2019s powers. There are a lot of people who don't fully understand what she can do.\u201d The woman suggested.</p>\n<p>Many of Peter\u2019s classmates who were upset with not getting to see the hammer stood up a bit straighter. Not understanding Scarlet Witch\u2019s powers was one of the reasons the Sokovia Accords were written. People didn't know what she could do, so they feared her.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut my hammer\u2026\u201d Thor drifted off. He was still upset about not getting to show it off. The other three heroes chose to ignore him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn order for this to work, I will need a volunteer.\u201d Wanda said to the class. There was only one person who didn't raise their hand. Even Mr. Larson and Katelyn raised their hands, and they weren't even supposed to participate. It was a chance to get close to an actual Avenger! Who wouldn't want to do that? Well, Peter wouldn't. He completely understood his friend\u2019s abilities, and he'd rather if she didn't notice him at all.</p>\n<p>Wanda looked through the crowd on the other side of the glass wall, skimming through all the different faces. Her eyes hovered on Peter\u2019s, and he could see a glimmer of mischievousness in them. That was never good news.</p>\n<p>\u201cPick me, witch lady!\u201d One of them begged. MJ rolled her eyes as Flash waved his hand around in the air to get her attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, just call me \u2018witch lady\u2019 one more time.\u201d She threatened the obnoxious kid. He didn't seem to understand that she wasn't being literal.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, witch lady!\u201d He used the offensive nickname again. Wanda visibly pursed her lips into a thin line.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, come over here.\u201d The young woman said, gesturing for him to enter the room through the door. Flash did so, an excited smile on his face. He looked over at Peter as if to rub it in his face that he\u2019d gotten picked and Peter hadn\u2019t. It was hilarious that he was oblivious.</p>\n<p>Wanda told Flash to stand in a certain place in the room. The boy was happy to do so. A miniscule amount of magic swarmed around Flash\u2019s head. Only Peter could see it, because he had impeccable eyesight due to the spider bite. Wanda slowly walked towards Flash, her heels clicking with every step she took.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm glad you think I'm hot.\u201d She told him. Flash\u2019s face visibly paled several shades. It was clear now that Wanda was reading Flash\u2019s mind. The boy tried to take a step towards the door to the hallway, but the red magic flowed to the front of his body and held him back. Flash looked just short of terrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you say to someone you're mean to?\u201d Wanda asked him, a fake sweetness in her voice. Flash mumbled something so quietly that even Peter couldn\u2019t hear it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it louder please.\u201d She instructed Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d The boy apologized to her more loudly. The magic faded from view as it swirled away from Flash. He took no time in rushing to the door, and back into the hallway with the rest of his class.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't take kindly to disrespectful people.\u201d Wanda warned the rest of the group. \u201cAre there any other volunteers?\u201d</p>\n<p>There were less hands raised this time, but only by a few. Everyone else still seemed eager to be with an Avenger. Wanda\u2019s eyes caught Peter\u2019s once more. The woman pretended to consider everyone else in the crowd, but then looked back over at Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung man in the back, step on up!\u201d She said, pointing to Peter. He had totally seen this coming. He mentally groaned, preparing himself for the worst as he stepped onto the mat.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442, \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a.\u201d Peter heard Nat whisper only loud enough for him to hear. He wasn\u2019t sure he was going to enjoy this. Natasha only ever called him that when she was going to do something he didn\u2019t like. She\u2019d said \u201chello little spider\u201d in Russian.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what you all just saw Wanda do was telepathy and energy manipulation, which are both psionic powers. Wanda got her powers from the exposure of cosmic energy from the mind stone. Because of this, all her powers are psionic.\u201d The assassin educated them. Peter was still awkwardly standing in the middle of the mat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanda also has telekinesis...\u201d Nat said, starting the list. Peter felt himself lift off the ground and flip in the air. It felt like someone was holding him by the ankle, but nobody was. Wanda was using her magic to hold Peter upside down by the ankle in midair. There was a glowing red surrounding his ankle.</p>\n<p>\u201c...flight\u2026\u201d The woman carried on. Wanda put Peter back on the mat. He sat up, and watched as Wanda floated into the air. Her magic was swirling all around her form.</p>\n<p>\u201c...psionic force field generation\u2026\u201d Scarlet Witch landed back down on the mat next to Peter. She turned to Thor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to show them your hammer now?\u201d Wanda asked the Asgardian. He perked up a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d love to!\u201d Thor exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Throw it at me.\u201d She instructed him. His face fell. \u201cDo it, Thor.\u201d Wanda said more firmly as she noticed the man\u2019s hesitation.</p>\n<p>He threw the hammer, and when it hit Wanda, it made a loud pinging sound. The area where Wanda was hit flickered red, but otherwise she was perfectly fine. The hammer fell to the ground on the mat. After Thor recovered from his shocked reaction, he summoned it back to him and placed it beside him on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201c...and mental manipulation.\u201d Nat finally finished. Wanda looked back down at Peter, who was still sitting on the mat. He took a deep breath, and hoped for the best. The class watched as Peter went from looking up at the Scarlet Witch, to laying completely sprawled out on the mat, snoring loudly.</p>\n<p>The whole class laughed, especially Flash. It was very funny to see the normally composed Peter Parker sleep in such a crazy position. Ned almost felt bad for his friend, but he knew after a while Peter wouldn\u2019t care about what happened today anyways. MJ didn\u2019t feel any guilt at laughing at her boyfriend. In fact, she already had a sketch of him in crisis from when he first went into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, now that we\u2019re finished here, my idiot brother will lead you all back downstairs.\u201d Loki strictly spoke, queuing for Thor to lead them towards the elevator. The Asgardian didn\u2019t notice it until Loki nudged him, or elbowed him, hard in the ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Yes! This way children of Midgard!\u201d Thor lead them all back the way they came. The group seemed upset to leave the private training room, for obvious reasons. As grand as the first floor was, it was nothing compared to the Avengers\u2019 training room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, Mr. Stark!\u201d Shouted a voice. It was Peter, who was still sleeping on the mat. His class was giving him weird looks, especially MJ.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to school!\u201d Peter unconsciously elaborated. In between words was incoherent mumbling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d Mumbling. \u201cChemistry class\u2026\u201d More mumbling. \u201c...my teacher\u2026\u201d More mumbling. \u201c...so boring\u2026\u201d Peter finished after some more mumbling.</p>\n<p>Mr. Larson looked downright offended. The students looked ready to burst with laughter. They could all agree on that aspect at least.</p>\n<p>Ned was looking back at Peter on the other side of the glass wall. Should he wait for his friend? Should he stick with MJ and the rest of his class?</p>\n<p>Wanda seemed to sense his uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring Peter back in a little while.\u201d She assured the class. Only Flash, Ned, and MJ noticed that nobody ever told Wanda Peter\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t as bad as you were making that out to be, Loki.\u201d Thor told his brother as the elevator doors closed. Loki didn\u2019t reply back.</p>\n<p>It was another slow trip down to the first floor. At least they didn\u2019t stop at all this time. You could see Loki\u2019s frustration with his brother showing on his face, but other than that the sibling rivalry didn\u2019t come up.</p>\n<p>The elevator dinged and the doors slid open, revealing lots of men with lots of cameras, and tons of commotion and loud noise.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cPetey Petey, wakey wakey.\u201d Wanda calmly spoke as she gently shook Peter. He wasn\u2019t waking up. She eventually gave up with being nice and began harshly shaking his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up! I did not put you under a very strong sleep spell.\u201d Wanda said to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get as much sleep as he tells Tony.\u201d Natasha said from behind her. Wanda could see the softness in her eyes.</p>\n<p>What was it with this kid that brought out everyone\u2019s gentle side? Why did he make the most irresponsible people act paternal? Peter had nearly all the Avengers wrapped around his fingers.</p>\n<p>Even Nat. She had Peter sitting up, and was rubbing circles on his back. Her other hand was combing through his curls, which weren\u2019t normally there. Whenever Wanda saw Nat like this, she always thought the woman would have made a wonderful mother, despite Nat\u2019s own opinions. Her expression was just so loving in these moments.</p>\n<p>The two watched as the young boy slowly stirred. He was definitely tired, and he looked like a child as he used his fists to rub his eyes. Peter yawned and moaned, then leaned back against Natasha.</p>\n<p>Wanda knew that if Peter was awake enough, he would never be doing this. Maybe that\u2019s the realization that brought the soft smile to Nat\u2019s face. She continued rubbing circles onto his back and Wanda watched the two for several minutes.</p>\n<p>Then of course Friday had to interrupt their scene.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was told to inform you that King T\u2019Challa and Princess Shuri have arrived.\u201d The AI told them.</p>\n<p>Peter was now wide awake. His eyes were wide and he scrambled to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did Friday just say?\u201d Peter exclaimed. His spider sense had tingled in his sleep. That was when he first discovered that he had been sleeping. Then he heard Friday speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess the royal family of Wakanda came.\u201d Natasha repeated for the AI. Peter looked panic stricken.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no. This is not good.\u201d Peter said out loud, but to himself. The boy felt paralyzed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might not even see her, Peter.\u201d Wanda pointed out.</p>\n<p>Peter considered it. That might be true, because the princess often came to help Tony with projects or give him access to other resources. When Peter first met Shuri, that had been the reason she was there.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Mr. Stark had asked Peter to work on the new coms in his suit. They were nearly the same as the older ones, but these adjusted to Peter\u2019s hearing sensitivity. It was generally different by the time and day, which was something Mr. Stark didn\u2019t know when he first made Peter the suit.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019d come straight from school in order to work on the newer coms. Mr. Stark couldn\u2019t really help him with coding it to right volume. It would be hard considering the man didn\u2019t have super hearing.</p>\n<p>Speaking of his super hearing, Peter could pick up the quiet sound of someone mumbling song lyrics. The person seemed to be nearby, and they were coming closer by the second. It really didn\u2019t sound like Mr. Stark, and Peter couldn\u2019t identify the voice.</p>\n<p>He made a split second decision and hid behind the couch in the lounge section of the lab. He watched as the unidentified person strode into the lab with a bounce to her step as she softly sang. Now that she was in the room, Peter could tell it was God\u2019s Plan by Drake.</p>\n<p>What were they doing here? Why is this person in Mr. Stark\u2019s private lab? As far as Peter knew, he and Dr. Banner were the only ones that Mr. Stark allowed in this lab. The situation seemed sketchy. But at least she had good taste in music.</p>\n<p>The girl had dark hair that was braided and twisted into two buns on the top of her head. It reminded Peter of Mickey Mouse a little bit. She wore an assortment of jewelry that mostly consisted of beads. The girl was definitely pretty, but she wasn\u2019t Peter\u2019s type. Plus, he liked MJ anyways.</p>\n<p>The weird thing was that the girl wasn\u2019t being discreet. She was loudly moving around and using Mr. Stark\u2019s tools and equipment. She didn\u2019t appear to be looking for anything in particular. A little device was in front of her, and she was just working on whatever it was. It seemed like she was allowed in here with the way she acted.</p>\n<p>He tried to inch closer to get a better look at the mystery girl, but his foot caught onto something in the process. Peter heard a crash and turned around. Dum-E was on the ground, but thankfully not broken. Mr. Stark wouldn\u2019t have been happy about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cDum-E!\u201d He shouted in worry. The friendly robot beeped in distress. Peter carefully picked him up and set him on the desk he was on before.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you talking to me or to yourself?\u201d The girl asked him. She was still steadily working on the device from before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was talking to the robot.\u201d Peter hesitantly answered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, so then you\u2019re definitely a dummy.\u201d She assumed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d He yelled in defense. Dum-E also let out some beeping in protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, I was just playing with you.\u201d The girl said, smiling. When Peter didn\u2019t say anything, she continued. \u201cSome man in the vents was telling me about Stark\u2019s kid. That\u2019s you, right?\u201d She asked him.</p>\n<p>Peter rapidly shook his head. \u201cNo. Mr. Stark doesn\u2019t have a kid. I\u2019m not sure why Clint told you that.\u201d He confidently answered.</p>\n<p>The girl smiled again. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to break it to you, but you\u2019re definitely Stark\u2019s kid.\u201d She informed Peter. The boy started stuttering.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Shuri, by the way.\u201d The girl told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Peter.\u201d He replied back. Realization sunk in and Peter\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cWait! You\u2019re Princess Shuri from Wakanda?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any other people named Shuri, so yes. But don\u2019t call me \u2018Princess Shuri of Wakanda\u2019, it makes me sound fancy and proper.\u201d Shuri confirmed. She switched to a British accent as she said fancy and proper.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Mr. Stark let you in here.\u201d Peter reasoned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. He thinks I\u2019m working in some boring lab he showed me. This actually has cool stuff in it.\u201d Shuri corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Stark will \u2013\u201d Peter began before he was cut off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do? Kick me out? I\u2019ll just find another way in later.\u201d She said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than for permission.\u201d Shuri quoted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d The boy trailed off. He walked back over to the station he was working at. Peter still had to adjust the right volumes for his different sensitivity levels.</p>\n<p>The two worked in silence for a bit. They weren\u2019t ignoring each other, they were just concentrating on their own tech. Peter wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Shuri, she was definitely different from what he imagined. She didn\u2019t act like a princess at all, and Peter liked that.</p>\n<p>At some point Peter heard the sound of an electrical shock. Shuri hissed and held her left index finger and shook it to ease the pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is so sad. Friday, play Despacito.\u201d Instructed Shuri.</p>\n<p>The AI did as told, and Peter couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. Shuri fake cried, using her hands to \u201cwipe away tears\u201d.</p>\n<p>The two spent hours showing each other memes and recreating vines. Lots of the tools and furniture in the lab were either used or moved, so the place became a mess. The two didn\u2019t care at all.</p>\n<p>Tony woke up from his midday nap a while later to discover the two there. He wasn\u2019t pleased, to say the least, but he also hadn\u2019t had his coffee yet, so it was a tough call.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Peter spent a while thinking about possible scenarios now that Shuri was in the tower. There wasn\u2019t any reason to worry about King T\u2019Challa. But Shuri wouldn\u2019t understand how much it would embarrass Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe promised your friend that we would bring you back to your class.\u201d Nat informed the kid. She watched him closely as he tried not to panic too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I wait just a few more minutes?\u201d Peter begged her. Natasha thought about it. She didn\u2019t like forcing him into anything. But she and Wanda had other things to do that day too.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a few. Wanda and I have to go somewhere, so you\u2019ll have to ask Friday where they are.\u201d Natasha told him, with Wanda still watching.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks!\u201d Peter said to the two women. They got up and walked over to the stairs. Apparently they were choosing the hard way to get around the tower. Or maybe they were trying to avoid some of Mr. Stark\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p>Peter was relieved. Now nobody would have to see him with Wanda and Nat any longer. He loved the two ladies, they were like family, but he didn\u2019t want people to know that.</p>\n<p>He took some deep breaths to prepare himself for what might happen. He might as well leave now. He\u2019d probably run into Shuri no matter what he did. It seemed inevitable.</p>\n<p>As Peter was about to leave the training room and go back into the hallway, he caught sight of Thor\u2019s hammer. It was just lying in the middle of the room, just outside the mat. Wouldn\u2019t Thor want that in a less obvious place?</p>\n<p>On his way out, he picked up the hammer and placed it closer to the wall of the room. Now it wouldn\u2019t be lying around. Thor would still be able to find it if he came looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my class, Friday?\u201d Peter asked the helpful AI.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are heading to the second floor soon, so you should wait there.\u201d Friday suggested.</p>\n<p>He may as well. No need to go to the first floor just to go up another. There was no harm in that. Peter pressed the button for the second floor, and waited a few minutes as the elevator slowly descended. There were a ton of floors in this tower.</p>\n<p>There was a ding and the doors slid open once more. Peter stepped out and sat in one of the nearby chairs. This way he could see the elevator and would know when his class came. Peter leaned back and relaxed as he waited, he was still sleepy from his unwanted power nap.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d have to talk to Wanda about that later. Peter wasn\u2019t fond of falling asleep in front of his class without consent. It could have been much worse, Peter knew, but that still doesn\u2019t mean he has to like it. However, that was for a different time, maybe when he came back here after he went back to school at the end of the day. That part was slightly annoying too.</p>\n<p>As Peter got lost in his thoughts, a door nearby opened, which Peter didn\u2019t notice. It was one of the squeakier doors in the tower, so it definitely made noise as it opened.</p>\n<p>A young woman stepped out, her phone in hand. Unlike the last time she\u2019d been here, her hair was twisted into a bun, with the rest hanging down her back. She\u2019d been wearing a dress just moments ago, but now she wore a normal outfit for the average teenager. The press didn\u2019t go easy on her at all, especially now that Wakanda wasn\u2019t a secret anymore. The world wanted to know every little aspect of it.</p>\n<p>Shuri noticed the boy, now nearly asleep, in the chair. A smile of excitement spread across her features, and she nearly bounced on top of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d She shouted, running over and squishing him in her hug. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in so long!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShuri, I can\u2019t \u2013\u201d Peter started explaining. The girl seemed to pick up on what he was saying very quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Sorry Peter.\u201d Apologized Shuri.</p>\n<p>Peter was thrilled to see his friend, but now was not the time. He prayed his class wasn\u2019t coming up too soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony said that he wanted to work more on the Accords with my brother, so I decided to come along!\u201d Shuri told him excitedly. She couldn\u2019t wait to hang out with Peter for the next few days!</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! Did I ever show you the upgrades I made to my suit?\u201d Peter asked her. He couldn\u2019t remember if he\u2019d said anything the last time they talked through video chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Shuri responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Well, it has \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was kidding! You\u2019ve told me maybe a hundred times!\u201d The girl explained to Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d He paused in thought. \u201cDid I show you my new R2D2? I also have the structure pieces done for BB8, but his code and wiring aren\u2019t done yet.\u201d Peter rambled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made Star Wars droids? How did I not think of that? Have you made C-3PO yet? We could make a version of him too!\u201d The girl reacted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten there yet. We didn\u2019t even have time to finish remaking all those vines from last time! And now there\u2019s more memes!\u201d The teen reminded her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know! I never got to do the mannequin challenge when it was a thing, we need to do that! You should get your Avenger buddies to do it with us, it would go viral!\u201d Shuri suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I could get the Avengers in on it, I can\u2019t see Nat doing that sort of thing. But I bet we could set up some holograms and it would look the same!\u201d Peter brainstormed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! We could use the holograms to make the Avengers do the \u2018in my feelings challenge\u2019 too!\u201d Said Shuri in excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the zoom challenge! Ned and I did that one, but I haven\u2019t gotten to do it with you yet!\u201d Peter added. He was going to bring up the \u2018you\u2019re so precious when you smile\u2019 videos, and mention the one he did with MJ. Unfortunately, Shuri spoke before he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of people staring at us.\u201d She pointed out. Peter whipped around to see his whole class behind him.</p>\n<p>This was exactly what he\u2019d been trying to avoid. Now everyone had seen him with Shuri. They already saw him with Thor and Loki, but Shuri was the princess of Wakanda! Not that being a god was unimportant or anything.</p>\n<p>Flash was glaring daggers at Peter. Ned was awestruck, and Peter remembered their conversation from earlier that day. He wondered if Ned would actually try to ask Shuri out. MJ had her \u201ccrisis notebook\u201d out again. That probably meant that he looked terrified. The rest of their group looked confused.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ned spoke up. \u201cYou talk to the princess of Wakanda about me?\u201d He managed to squeak out. Ned looked ready to pounce on Peter for a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you Ned?\u201d Shuri asked the boy in the crowd who had spoken.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ned squeaked out again, shocked that Shuri was speaking to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to hang out sometime! You\u2019re the one who hacked into Peter\u2019s \u2013\u201d The girl almost slipped up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, great idea! You two should totally spend some time together.\u201d Peter agreed. He couldn\u2019t believe Shuri had almost spilled his secret. That would have been really bad.</p>\n<p>A buzzing sound was heard from Shuri\u2019s direction. She pulled out her phone from the back pocket of her shorts and looked at the screen. She apparently received a message.</p>\n<p>\u201cT\u2019Challa says I have to go up to the penthouse. You\u2019ll be coming up later, right?\u201d The girl asked Peter. He nodded in confirmation. Shuri turned to leave for the elevator, pocketing her phone.</p>\n<p>Flash looked about ready to burst. His face was bright red, similar to the ripe tomato look he\u2019d been sporting on the bus earlier. It slightly worried Peter, but he doubted Flash would do anything with Shuri nearby. Apparently his assumption was wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know Penis? It\u2019s not like he even deserves to know you.\u201d Flash exploded.</p>\n<p>Every head turned towards him, including Shuri\u2019s, which people noticed. They were all afraid for her reaction. Flash\u2019s eyes went wide. He apparently realized his mistake too late.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get that. I don\u2019t speak BS.\u201d Shuri harshly told him.</p>\n<p>Her face was tight, and her teeth were clenched. Their faces were only inches apart, and since Shuri was taller, it was very intimidating. Flash appeared to be shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter is one of my closest friends because he\u2019s a genuine person and is nice to everyone he talks to. If anything, I\u2019m the one who doesn\u2019t deserve to know him.\u201d She paused, making it dramatic and increasing the tension. \u201cI can talk to him about things that other people don\u2019t understand because he\u2019s such a nerd.\u201d That didn\u2019t come out exactly the way Shuri meant it to.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat might be a little advanced for your vocabulary. It means he\u2019s actually smart, unlike you.\u201d She explained. That was what she\u2019d meant before. But boy she was angry. Shuri couldn\u2019t believe the nerve of that kid to talk about Peter like that!</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I hear you say something like that to Peter again, then you\u2019ll have to deal with an angry Tony Stark. Even I don\u2019t know what that looks like.\u201d Shuri threatened.</p>\n<p>She still didn\u2019t leave. The girl shook her head in disbelief, she couldn\u2019t even fathom someone disliking Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough middle fingers to express myself to you.\u201d Shuri stated.</p>\n<p>She turned around back towards the elevator. Shuri jammed the button for the penthouse floor in anger. The doors eventually closed, but it felt like an eternity.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Tony Stark waited for the young princess to arrive. Friday had informed him when she and Peter had found each other down on the second floor. That part hadn\u2019t even been part of his plan, but it was even better!</p>\n<p>Tony didn\u2019t hear about the rest of what happened, so he was waiting for Shuri so she could tell him. The doors to the elevator opened with a ding and out stepped T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. Except, she didn\u2019t seem quite the way Tony expected her to be.</p>\n<p>She looked downright furious. Her hands were balled into fists. He recalled her saying it was like \u201cArthur\u2019s fist\u201d when someone did that. Her jaw was also clenched tight.</p>\n<p>What could have made her so angry while she was with Peter? It was unlikely that the two had fought, but Tony didn\u2019t know what would upset her like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYikes, what happened down there?\u201d He questioned her.</p>\n<p>Shuri was very tempted to tell Tony what had transpired downstairs. However, she knew Peter wouldn\u2019t want people knowing, especially Tony, so she decided to stay silent. She also told that useless turd she would tell Tony only if he did it again. But she wasn\u2019t doing it for him, only for Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of the press was very frustrating.\u201d She answered him.</p>\n<p>Tony seemed like he wanted to talk, but Shuri was not in the mood for it at the moment. She walked straight past him, towards the first open guest room. It left Tony confused, but he wasn\u2019t about to deal with an angry princess.</p>\n<p>He still wondered what could have made her so mad. Normally the press wouldn\u2019t bother her so much, so he wasn\u2019t falling for that lie. He\u2019d have to keep a closer eye on Peter.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Natasha had watched Shuri come in the penthouse fuming and looking enraged. That emotion was not often present within the young girl. Nat had heard her excuse and instantly knew it was a big fat lie. That made her very suspicious.</p>\n<p>Natasha was currently watching the video footage of Peter and Shuri talking. It wasn\u2019t anything to worry about, just teenager talk. That is, until Peter\u2019s class saw them there.</p>\n<p>She watched the interactions, which seemed to be fine. Then Shuri was leaving. Nothing was wrong, she didn\u2019t even look angry.</p>\n<p>Then that jerk spoke up. Nat immediately understood Shuri\u2019s reaction. She would have acted differently, probably lock him in a neck hold and threaten him worse. For the most part though, Shuri had reacted perfectly.</p>\n<p>She also understood why Shuri didn\u2019t tell Tony. She and Peter were friends, and she valued that and wanted to protect it. Natasha wasn\u2019t going to hold anything against the princess. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the assassin has to do the same.</p>\n<p>Nat used Tony\u2019s tech to find the boy\u2019s identity. His name was Flash Thompson. She instantly hated the name.</p>\n<p>Natasha was going to give Flash one heck of a field trip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys should take a look at this.\u201d Natasha said aloud to the team.</p>\n<p>They were all lounging in the living room. Clint and Sam were still video gaming, with someone else joining them here and there. Tony was actually taking a break from being in his lab, but only to get some more coffee. Rhodey must have just woken up, because he was eating a late breakfast. Wanda was reading a book, apparently in Sokovian. Bruce was nowhere to be seen, but maybe that was for the best. Steve was back to his sketching, and he must have been drawing Bucky because he was sitting aesthetically in front of the window.</p>\n<p>All the heads turned to look at Nat, except for Sam\u2019s and Clint\u2019s. That was not acceptable. The assassin took the remote from its spot on the coffee table and turned the TV off in the middle of their game.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just about to get robo-bird over there! He was nearly in my grasp!\u201d Shouted Clint in protest. Nat gave him a stern look, and he immediately shut himself up.</p>\n<p>Everyone set their things down, except for Tony with his coffee, and followed Nat. She let them to the private room she was in earlier. They were all curious as to why she was upset like Shuri had been only minutes before.</p>\n<p>\u201cFriday, play the video recording I was just watching.\u201d She ordered the AI. She dutifully complied, pulling up a large hologram in the middle of the room so everyone could see.</p>\n<p>They watched the end of Peter and Shuri\u2019s interaction and Shuri beginning to leave. They heard that douchebag make the comment about Peter, their Peter. They saw the way Shuri handled it, throwing insult after insult. That kid deserved it.</p>\n<p>As the video played, the team\u2019s expressions changed. Gone were the joyful moods from video games, or the calm moods from reading or drawing peacefully. The Avengers, the earth\u2019s protectors and mightiest heroes, were angry. Bad things happened when the Avengers were angry. They avenged.</p>\n<p>\u201cFriday, play that one more time.\u201d The billionaire instructed. The AI did as told, replaying the entire scene.</p>\n<p>The disbelief that had been present in the room died down, and adrenaline replaced it. Even though Shuri had taken care of that particular situation, they couldn\u2019t let something like that happen again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSend this to Pepper, and make sure she watches it, Fri.\u201d Tony half growled out. His AI didn\u2019t deserve that tone, but he was too upset to care at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Potts is currently watching the video.\u201d Friday announced.</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful, then she\u2019ll understand why that prick will be waiting on the sidewalk instead of taking the tour.\u201d Tony started walking towards the elevator.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Natasha commanded him. It was a dangerous move considering how furious he was. Tony turned back around to look at her. \u201cWe should come up with a plan of attack.\u201d She suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say your plan is to attack.\u201d Steve told him, recalling their first mission together.</p>\n<p>Tony sighed in defeat. \u201cAlright. But we better make this quick.\u201d Everyone looked to Nat for instructions.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo the honors, Cap.\u201d She said to the super soldier. And they began planning.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, let's continue the tour.\u201d Katelyn announced, interrupting the silence. She went back in front of the group so she could lead them all again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next place I will show you is \u2013\u201d Katelyn was cut off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe conference room.\u201d Pepper Potts informed them. Katelyn saw the tall woman standing beside her and glanced up with a confused expression. People kept interrupting her tour, and she didn\u2019t know what to do about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Midtown Science. As I\u2019m sure you all know, I am Pepper Potts, the CEO of Stark Industries. I\u2019ll be your tour guide for the rest of the day.\u201d She announced with a friendly smile. Then she faced Katelyn. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay here with them, go ahead and work on your project.\u201d Pepper said, releasing her. The intern nodded and walked off in a different direction.</p>\n<p>Peter was frightened, and that was an understatement. He wasn\u2019t sure what had just occurred upstairs. Shuri may have told them about Flash, but he didn\u2019t think so. She understood and respected the friend code well enough not to do that.</p>\n<p>But, despite what happened, the team knew about Flash. Peter had no idea what they would do. He didn\u2019t want them to pick on Flash, even though he highly disliked him (because hate is a strong word). Also, if the team picked on him, Flash would bully Peter even more when the others weren\u2019t around. There were just no benefits to whatever they were doing.</p>\n<p>MJ seemed to disagree. She was grinning, and it didn\u2019t look innocent. MJ hated Flash, probably more than he did. Knowing her, she was probably excited for what was coming up. She\u2019d also probably have a few more sketches in her \u201ccrisis notebook\u201d after the trip.</p>\n<p>As they walked, Peter could feel Flash\u2019s gaze on him. He didn\u2019t doubt that his glare would send lasers through Peter\u2019s head. It was honestly a little freaky. When Peter turned to look at Flash, he snapped his head in the other direction, as if pretending he wasn\u2019t just trying to stare Peter down moments ago.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t feel any better when they finally got to the conference room. His spider sense was tingling, and that was never a good sign. So far today it was only going off when there was an Avenger nearby.</p>\n<p>The room was fairly comfortable. The floor was covered in carpeting, and while it wasn\u2019t soft, it gave the room a relaxing aura. There was a large table in the center of the room, with at least a dozen chairs surrounding it. The chairs were soft, as opposed to the leather that sticks to your legs, and were spinny. Behind the head of the table was a whiteboard. It was clean at the moment, but you could still see the leftover ink that didn\u2019t come off when it was wiped. A hologram projector sat at the head seat at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can all have a seat in front of the whiteboard.\u201d Pepper instructed them sweetly. She quickly noticed there wouldn\u2019t be enough space for everyone in that section.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, would you mind helping me move these over?\u201d The woman asked, as she walked towards the table and chairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, uh, sure.\u201d Peter said with uncertainty. He was very conscious of the eyes watching him. Why would Pepper Potts know him? Then again, Steve, Thor, Loki, and Shuri had all known him too.</p>\n<p>He helped Pepper roll the chair in a corner and lift the table into another corner. Everyone who hadn\u2019t taken a seat before now sat down. Peter took a seat next to Ned and MJ.</p>\n<p>Pepper walked up to the front of the room like a teacher would. \u201cWe have a special guest here to talk to you guys today! Let me introduce you to Steve Rogers, or better known as Captain America!\u201d The woman announced to the class.</p>\n<p>And with that, the super soldier walked out carrying a chair and wearing his bright spangly outfit.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>May couldn\u2019t concentrate the way she usually could at work. The business of it all generally pushed away any stray thoughts. It had really helped her when she was recovering from Ben\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>But the thoughts that were bouncing around in her mind right now weren\u2019t stray. She was thinking about Peter. May was wondering if Tony was keeping his unofficial promise. She hoped that Pepper would at least keep him from doing anything drastic. A little bit was okay though, that was why she called Tony in the first place.</p>\n<p>When she finally got on her lunch break, she decided to give Pepper a call. It was probably fine, but May wanted to be prepared in case something happened.</p>\n<p>She waited a few seconds before Pepper answered. \u201cHello May. Is something wrong?\u201d The woman asked her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I was just checking up on Peter.\u201d She informed Pepper. \u201cI wanted to make sure Tony\u2019s not bothering him too much.\u201d May clarified some more.</p>\n<p>Pepper thought about how to answer that. She could tell May what was going on and how Flash was bullying Peter. That would be the right thing to do. But Pepper knew that Peter might not trust her and Tony the same way after that, and he certainly wouldn't tell them when this sort of thing happened again. She didn't want to lose May\u2019s trust, but Peter was both of their priorities, so in the end, not telling May was the better option.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't worry, Tony isn't bothering Peter at all.\u201d Pepper assured the protective aunt as she watched Steve enter the room Peter's class was in.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Peter froze. Of course this was going to happen. Stuff like this happened to Peter all the time. It was just part of his \u201cParker Luck\u201d. He guessed he would just have to sit through it.</p>\n<p>Cap put the chair down backwards and sat down on it facing the class. He was using the back of the chair as an armrest. This reminded Peter of his time in detention and the Captain America fitness challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been caught in a tough situation. Someone is bothering you, and you\u2019re not sure what to do. Trust me, as a man that\u2019s been living as long as nearly a century, I know what bullying is like.\u201d He started lecturing them. The righteousness in his voice was unbelievable. It also sounded incredibly fake.</p>\n<p>Of course he would make up another PSA. At least Peter remotely knew what they were doing. And they definitely heard Flash\u2019s comment. There was no question about that now. Honestly, Peter was surprised that a PSA on bullying hadn\u2019t been made earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe best thing you can do is ignore the person. Usually, they\u2019re just jealous. If they ask you for something, just say no. Most of the time, the person will stop after you take those steps.\u201d Captain America instructed them.</p>\n<p>Through most of this, Peter was trying not to get too embarrassed. But he was partially listening to Cap talk. Peter had actually done most of these things when Flash was being annoying.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, if they won\u2019t leave you alone after this, it\u2019s time to take another course of action. It\u2019s best to talk to your parents first, but if you can\u2019t do that, then talk to your teacher. Sometimes you might not be comfortable talking about this to your family or teacher, but you should still talk to someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>It almost seemed like Steve was calling him out. In fact, he probably was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was in school, I was able to talk to my best friend and his family about my problems.\u201d Cap confessed to everyone.</p>\n<p>Bucky took that as his que to enter. He was dressed in a version of his old officer uniform. It didn\u2019t really go well with his metal arm, but it would have to do. Both his and Steve\u2019s outfits were just costumes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, I am Sergeant Barnes, or better known to my friends as Bucky.\u201d He said as he walked up next to Steve. He had entered through a side door like Cap had earlier, so people didn\u2019t know he was coming.</p>\n<p>It seemed like he had especially caught Peter off guard. His eyes were wide as he watched Bucky. The kid didn\u2019t look excited to hear what they were saying. Bucky didn\u2019t care, this stuff was important for Peter to hear, and for that Thompson kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I joined Cap in fighting for our country, we were best friends. Because of this, I knew that a lot of bigger and stronger men liked to bully him and beat him up. But I could help Steve, so together we would stop them.\u201d Bucky explained.</p>\n<p>Captain America looked Flash dead in the eyes. \u201cBut even then, I wasn\u2019t afraid to punch a bully in the face.\u201d</p>\n<p>They watched as Flash\u2019s face paled several shades. That kid ought to be scared, the Avengers were out to get him. Steve\u2019s threat was also not a light one. He was a super soldier after all.</p>\n<p>The two Avengers left the room, leaving the class in silence. Pepper stepped back up to the front of the room to address the group. \u201cI think now is a wonderful time for your lunch break.\u201d She told them.</p>\n<p>Pepper\u2019s expression was smug, but it was almost impossible to tell. To someone who didn\u2019t know her, she would just seem like a very happy lady. But to Peter, it was her victory face.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Tony was looking through all the security footages from Peter\u2019s school. He was skipping through all the parts that didn\u2019t have either Flash or Peter in them. Everything else was deemed unimportant from Tony\u2019s point of view.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you found anything?\u201d Clint asked him. Everyone was worried about the kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems like Peter\u2019s been putting up with this guy since their freshman year.\u201d Tony answered.</p>\n<p>It was true. In their very first class, Flash decided to pick on Peter. They hadn\u2019t even known each other then and he was already on his kid. At least Ned was with Peter through the thick and thin of it.</p>\n<p>Tony could hear Rhodey sigh next to him. \u201cThat kid has gone through way too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>The billionaire knew that he didn\u2019t just mean as Spider-Man. Too much of his family had died too. His parents died when he was only four, and then his Uncle Ben had passed away just after Peter was bitten. That alone was a lot to handle.</p>\n<p>That was one of the reasons that Tony let Peter get close to him. Before, he was certain he would be a terrible mentor and role model, and would have shut down the idea of being either of those to someone so young. But after meeting Peter, Tony realized that mentoring him was better for the kid than having nothing. He still never imagined the kid would get so involved in his life and would eventually get his own room in the tower.</p>\n<p>Watching the feed broke Tony\u2019s heart. There were days when he remembered that Peter was going through a rough time, and it seemed like Flash teased him about it.</p>\n<p>Like the day after homecoming in their sophomore year. Apparently Flash had heard that Liz\u2019s dad gave him \u201cthe talk\u201d before the dance started, and that Peter disappeared shortly after. The recording showed Flash bullying Peter for being weak and too afraid to face someone\u2019s dad. It made Tony feel sick.</p>\n<p>Another of these scenarios happened just later that day. They were doing weights in gym, and Peter was using some sort of equipment where you have to lift the bar over your head. The kid had set it on really heavy weights and was struggling to lift it. Peter began hyperventilating, and was soon excused from the class. When he came back, Flash teased him for \u201chaving the strength of a girl\u201d. Tony remembered Peter telling him that the Vulture trapped him under the rubble of a building and he had to lift it up to escape.</p>\n<p>Tony really wanted to bash this guy\u2019s head open for hurting Peter. Most of the time his comments were short lived and didn\u2019t mean anything. But, there were other times when he would make a comment that hit home.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t fully understand why Peter hadn\u2019t told him earlier about Flash. Tony knew that telling someone was stressful, and that Peter wouldn\u2019t want Tony to do anything about it. But why didn\u2019t the kid just tell him that?</p>\n<p>There was no way that Tony could do nothing, but he could certainly make his actions little enough not to be noticed. He could simply make a few calls to Peter\u2019s teachers and tell them to keep an eye on Flash and Peter. They didn\u2019t even have to know he was Tony Stark!</p>\n<p>And sure, usually laying low like that wasn\u2019t his forte, but for Peter, he would do it.</p>\n<p>Except now, Flash had made him mad. And there was no way to convince the others not to carry out their plan.</p>\n<p>Pepper lead the class away from Steve and Bucky, and in the direction of the eating area. Peter knew that there were two. One was inside near the entrance area, and the other was an outdoor courtyard. Pepper was leading them to the courtyard.</p>\n<p>It was a quaint place. There were bushes and shrubs, as well as trees and flowers along the edges. There were a few round picnic tables with umbrellas in the center for shade. It wasn\u2019t huge, but it was reasonably sized and comfortable for relaxing.</p>\n<p>Some people were already there. Many of them were interns, but there were also small groups of business men dressed in fancy attire. The other school group that Peter had seen at the entrance was there eating their own lunches.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s class all chose a place to sit down and eat. Since a lot of the places to sit were already taken, they had to sit in the grass. In the permission slip, everybody was told to pack a lunch. Most people had brought one in a brown lunch bag.</p>\n<p>Ned and Peter followed MJ to a shady spot against the wall. Ned was practically bouncing in his spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, how do you know so many Avengers? I knew about Tony Stark, but you didn\u2019t tell me about everyone else!\u201d Ned excitedly exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never said anything about Captain America! Then Thor shows up and knows you too! Peter, you are so lucky.\u201d The boy quickly added.</p>\n<p>Peter honestly didn\u2019t know how to answer that. He was too humble to talk about all of it, not that he tried to be. Peter also knew that this was how Ned would react, so that\u2019s why he never told him in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he called you mini Stark.\u201d MJ whispered in Peter\u2019s ear. Ned didn\u2019t even seem to notice, as he was too lost in his own thoughts.</p>\n<p>MJ knew that the comment would annoy him. How many times already had Clint brought it up in the penthouse? Everyone who didn\u2019t know Peter seemed to think the two were related, but they weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Sure, Mr. Stark was a great mentor. But it definitely wasn\u2019t anything more than that. He just came to the tower on weekends to train with the team and work in the lab, they didn\u2019t really hang out besides that.</p>\n<p>Alright, maybe Peter wanted Mr. Stark to be more. Maybe he sometimes called Mr. Stark \u201cDad\u201d in his mind occasionally on accident. That didn\u2019t mean they had that relationship.</p>\n<p>But the whole Avengers team seemed to think otherwise. As mentioned earlier, Clint constantly reminded Tony and Peter, calling the younger of the two \u201cyour kid\u201d and Tony \u201cyour old man\u201d. Eventually the others caught on, and now that\u2019s just what they were called.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not! Peter protested. He sounded like a little kid with the way he whined.</p>\n<p>MJ raised her eyebrows. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d She questioned her boyfriend. He was getting more and more annoyed, and it was a lot of fun for MJ.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just go to his lab on the weekends. That\u2019s it. You know that, MJ.\u201d Peter insisted. MJ hummed in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI also know that he drives you to and from school almost every day.\u201d The girl added.</p>\n<p>MJ didn\u2019t usually see Peter until he was actually in the building in the mornings, but May had informed her of the arrangement. As for driving Peter home, MJ always walked from school and would see Tony Stark in one of his less fancy cars waiting in the kiss and ride line.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u201dThat\u2019s only because of May\u2019s promotion! She works longer shifts now and can\u2019t get me there herself!\u201d Her boyfriend argued with her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was Happy who drove you before, not May.\u201d She pointed out. Peter groaned. MJ wouldn\u2019t let herself lose this argument.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. We\u2019re close, but he\u2019s not my dad.\u201d Peter finally submitted.</p>\n<p>His annoyed expression made MJ smirk. He looked so cute like this. She knew that Peter knew it too. He didn\u2019t exactly agree with it, but he knew about it. May mentioned it when MJ didn\u2019t, so he heard about it plenty from the two ladies.</p>\n<p>She was also suspicious of Stark reminding her boyfriend of it also. Sometimes Peter came to school on Monday mornings looking annoyed, and Tony was the last person Peter saw. Maybe Ms. Potts was up to it too.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know that Scarlet Witch knows your name? Do you know her too? Does that mean you also know Black Widow? You could be like spider partners! That would be super cool!\u201d Ned rambled.</p>\n<p>Peter hadn\u2019t heard his friend rant in a while. He almost missed it because of what had happened so far thay day. He\u2019d take Ned\u2019s rambling over endless embarrassment any day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you told the princess of Wakanda about me! Did you hear what she said? She said we should hang out sometime! How cool is that?\u201d His best friend continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll let me see her lab? Would I get to go to Wakanda? Could I actually use some of her tech? Hey, didn\u2019t she almost say something about me hacking into your suit? Do you think she was impressed? Probably not, she could probably do that way faster than I did.\u201d He went on. The boy hadn\u2019t even started eating yet because he was talking so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you think is smarter, Tony Stark or Princess Shuri? If what the press says about Shuri is true and she actually designed the metro system in Wakanda, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s her. Tony Stark did create the arc reactor though. And his suit too. But Shuri made the Black Panther suit. Did you know that his suit turns kinetic energy into potential energy, and then back into kinetic? I think that\u2019s awesome!\u201d Ned went on.</p>\n<p>Eventually Peter zoned Ned out, it didn\u2019t seem like the other boy needed answers anyway. His lunch was good and everything was peaceful.</p>\n<p>Until his spider sense flared again.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you can stay on?\u201d Sam checked, unsure. He was giving Clint a disbelieving look.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I can. I trained at Shield, remember?\u201d The immature man assured him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but did they teach you how to do anything like this?\u201d Asked Sam. He wasn\u2019t going to trust Clint so easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly. But we only use the training half the time anyways. For the other half, we completely wing it.\u201d Clint explained. He smiled at his obvious pun, knowing it would annoy Sam.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly comforting.\u201d The winged hero stated.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww. I didn\u2019t know you cared.\u201d Clint responded. He pretended to look touched.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, bird brain.\u201d Sam said back.</p>\n<p>He straightened out his wings in set his tinted goggles in place. A moment later, he jumped off one of the side balconies on Stark Tower.</p>\n<p>It was a little harder to control the direction he was going in. His turns were significantly wider, but he\u2019d have to get used to it. He couldn\u2019t really stop flying at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019re hanging in there, Legolas?\u201d Sam teased the other man on his back.</p>\n<p>He looked behind him to see Clint struggling to hang on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing great!\u201d He said instead, but the death grip Clint had on the back of his suit begged to differ.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, that\u2019s Tony\u2019s thing! He\u2019s The only one who calls me that.\u201d Clint whined at Sam. The winged man laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when? I think I\u2019m fully privileged to call you whatever I want.\u201d Sam replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been Stark\u2019s thing since before Cap met you.\u201d Informed Clint.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez, you didn\u2019t have to go that far, man. That stung.\u201d He told Clint. \u201cYou do realize I could throw you off whenever I want, right?\u201d He asked, making a great point.</p>\n<p>Sam jerked to the side slightly just to prove it. Clint swallowed, clearly just thinking about it now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. So I\u2019m going to call you whatever I want, Oliver Queen.\u201d Sam finished, satisfied with the turnout. He could see Clint pouting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, Maximum Ride.\u201d Clint glumly replied.</p>\n<p>Sam wasn\u2019t too sure when Clint originally came up with this idea. However, he completely changed his mind when he saw what Flash did to Peter. That was absolutely not okay.</p>\n<p>It was time to do their jobs. They were called the Avengers for a reason. Apparently that bully didn\u2019t realize it before. He would definitely know after everyone got to him.</p>\n<p>Clint had been rushing Sam the whole time he was suiting up. He even tried to help put the wings on, but that didn\u2019t end up so well. It actually slowed them down, and Clint still had the nerve to blame him for it. Sam didn\u2019t really know what else he was expecting, this was just how Clint was.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you done practicing, Tinker Bell, or should I fly this suit myself?\u201d Clint grumbled. That man was not patient.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d Sam replied, a smile gracing his face as he tried to imagine Clint flying his suit. That would be a disaster. With the wings and the arrows, he may as well be Cupid.</p>\n<p>He still turned around back towards Stark Tower to please the man on his back. Sam wanted to fly around a bit before they carried out their plan. Clint was obviously opposed to the idea since it meant he had to wait longer, but too bad for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPepper says they should be outside in the courtyard.\u201d Clint informed him.</p>\n<p>Sam swooped lower and flew around the tower towards the courtyard. He\u2019d never actually been out there himself since he stayed in the penthouse so much. He never found the need to go down there. Steve had tried to convince him one time, saying it was a chance to get some fresh air and some food. He still didn\u2019t go.</p>\n<p>The winged man stayed high enough so he wasn\u2019t too noticeable to the people below. It would completely foil their plan if someone saw him. Clint would probably throw a tantrum if he let that happen. It was probably best not to do that.</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Sam heard the sound of one of Clint\u2019s arrows zooming past his head. He watched as it quickly shot downwards towards Peter\u2019s class.</p>\n<p>It almost looked like it was going to hit Peter\u2019s bully, especially from the height they were at. But it didn\u2019t quite, and the arrow shot back towards the archer.</p>\n<p>Except when Clint caught the arrow, Sam noticed a sandwich on it. Of all the things to shoot at, of course Clint chose a sandwich.</p>\n<p>This was Sam\u2019s que to get closer to the tour group. He swooped down so that he was maybe 20 feet off the ground. They just had to be close enough for everyone to hear them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for these boomerang arrows, Pete!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for these boomerang arrows, Pete!\u201d Came a loud voice from above.</p>\n<p>Peter whipped his head towards the voice. Sam was flying with his suit on, not too high above them. The weirdest part was that Clint was on his back. He was holding on with one hand, and in the other was one of the arrows Peter recently designed, and a sandwich.</p>\n<p>The kid\u2019s eyes went wide. Hadn\u2019t the others embarrassed him enough? Peter knew they were trying to get back at Flash for what he said earlier, but didn\u2019t they realize they were still embarrassing him in the process?</p>\n<p>Clint took a big bite out of the fresh sub. He made a face of pure delight to signify how delicious the sandwich was.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this one from Delmar\u2019s too, Flash? Peter keeps telling me how good their sandwiches are, but I\u2019ve never been there myself.\u201d Clint asked the boy.</p>\n<p>Flash looked freaked out that another Avenger was here, but also really upset that his lunch was gone. He looked conflicted on whether or not he should say something.</p>\n<p>Peter hadn\u2019t even realized it was Flash\u2019s food, he just assumed it was Clint\u2019s. Apparently not. He hadn\u2019t seen it, but the archer likely used the boomerang arrow to get the food. That is definitely something Clint would come up with.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind is this? Italian?\u201d Clint asked, delightfully munching on the sandwich. Peter knew he was just trying to rub it in Flash\u2019s face more. Clearly the boy didn\u2019t realize that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just steal my sandwich! I don\u2019t care who you are!\u201d Flash yelled up at Clint. The man kept a face of indifference.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither.\u201d Clint replied to the boy.</p>\n<p>That seemed to humble Flash ever so slightly. According to his expression, he remembered who he was talking to. It was a good thing too, because Clint wouldn\u2019t let Flash win, even if he put up a fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still my sandwich.\u201d Flash repeated himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I took it.\u201d Clint explained to the irritated boy.</p>\n<p>Flash looked confused, as well as angry that he wouldn\u2019t get his lunch back. Clint decided to elaborate a bit more.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like what you did to Peter on December 22nd last year.\u201d The archer started. Flash still looked incredibly confused, maybe even more so now. \u201cYou stole Peter\u2019s lunch that day.\u201d Clint finished.</p>\n<p>The bully no longer appeared confused. He was still angry though, but didn\u2019t say anything. He slowly seemed to be learning not to talk to the Avengers and Peter the way he had been earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey say people get what they deserve. In your case it\u2019s a stolen sandwich.\u201d Clint added taking another bite.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>The rest if the Avengers watched from one of the balconies. It was too good to miss. Clint had the right character for this part of the plan, and it was going great so far.</p>\n<p>Tony was glad that Flash was getting what he deserved. It was about time too. Tony hadn\u2019t realized until earlier that Peter was being bullied for so long.</p>\n<p>The kid really deserved better. He worked so hard all the time with everything he did. The kid forced himself to get near perfect grades in school. When he was out as Spider-Man, he could tell based on Peter\u2019s heart rate and fatigue that he was working almost too hard. In the lab, Peter tried to get every small detail perfect, and when he messed up, he was too hard on himself for it.</p>\n<p>Tony just wanted what was best for his kid. He didn\u2019t need anything else.</p>\n<p>The rest of the Avengers teased him about it constantly too. It was practically his motto, and his team could probably tell.</p>\n<p>Clint called Peter \u201cyour kid\u201d when he talked to Tony. He also heard that Clint addressed him as \u201cyour old man\u201d when he was talking to Peter.</p>\n<p>Tony liked the names, he just didn\u2019t like that he was teased about it. If they said it like it was a normal occurrence, he wouldn\u2019t mind at all.</p>\n<p>He also wasn\u2019t sure what the kid thought of it. Tony didn\u2019t want the kid to be freaked out. But Clint knew his limits for the most part, and he figured Peter probably didn\u2019t mind too much if the man was still doing it.</p>\n<p>And yes, of course he heard about what Thor said when he got to the tower. The god had come bounding through the elevator after he left Peter\u2019s group, with Loki in tow. He didn\u2019t realize the god actually thought they were related by blood. They didn\u2019t look that alike did they?</p>\n<p>So no, they weren\u2019t father and son. But if Tony was being completely honest, he would love it if they were. He already thought of Peter as his son in his head. It probably wouldn\u2019t even change their relationship too much.</p>\n<p>Tony would never admit any of this, of course. He still had plenty if pride to keep in check and the press to watch out for. He assumed that the rest if his team didn\u2019t need him to tell them though, based on the teasing.</p>\n<p>Maybe he would bring some of this up to Peter sometime. Not too seriously of course, that wasn\u2019t Tony\u2019s forte. Probably as a joke. Tony wasn\u2019t sure, and now wasn\u2019t the time to think about this stuff anyways.</p>\n<p>Peter would have to forgive him first. Hopefully it wouldn\u2019t be too long of a road.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s turn was coming up, and just like the others, he was ready to give Flash one heck of a field trip.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow everyone follow me, we have a Q&amp;A with Tony Stark!\u201d Pepper announced to the eager students.</p>\n<p>Everyone had finished eating their lunches, except for Flash. They got to relax a little bit before Pepper continued their tour.</p>\n<p>It was a wonderful break for Peter. He was definitely not excited for the Q&amp;A. Based on the way things were going, it wouldn\u2019t turn out well for him. Or even Flash for that matter.</p>\n<p>Everyone looked super excited, and Peter heard many of the girls squealing. He sighed. He missed the days he felt the same about seeing Mr. Stark. Not that he didn\u2019t like seeing his da- mentor, they were just used to each other enough that Peter didn\u2019t feel that kind if excitement anymore.</p>\n<p>Pepper hadn\u2019t told them where in the tower they were going, but Peter guessed it was the press conference room. He recognized the hallway they were in. Usually this was where Mr. Stark would make announcements about the company and hold press conferences. Sometimes it would be set up so people could walk around and look at the new tech that would soon be released. Generally, it wasn\u2019t used for anything else.</p>\n<p>But apparently now it would be. That couldn\u2019t mean anything good at all.</p>\n<p>Peter followed Pepper and his class. There were lots of excited whispers from the jittery students. Peter was just jittery for a whole different reason. MJ surprisingly excited too. Based on her expression, she also knew something was coming. Great. Ned was being Ned, and was soaking in everything he could, his expression in awe. Peter was surprised he wasn\u2019t rambling like before.</p>\n<p>Apparently Peter thought too soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Hawkeye knows you too? And you talked to him about Delmar\u2019s? Does that mean he knows your sandwich order? Does Tony Stark know your sandwich order? Has he ever gone to buy you a sandwich? I would love if Tony Stark bought me food!\u201d Ned excitedly babbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has ordered you food before, Ned.\u201d Peter pointed out to his friend. Ned looked like he remembered that now that Peter mentioned it.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight! But it would be cool if he knew my sandwich order too.\u201d The boy paused in thought. \u201cHow many Avengers to you actually know? I\u2019m pretty sure almost all of then have come up to you today! Do you know Ant-Man too? What about Dr. Strange? I heard he\u2019s basically a wizard. Do you think he has one of those wizard hats? Do you think he\u2019s more like Harry Potter? Would he have a wand then?\u201d He chattered some more.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just has a cape, Ned, and a glowing green necklace.\u201d Peter answered the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d Ned said.</p>\n<p>When they got to the press conference room, Pepper had everyone sit down on the floor again. Peter personally hated sitting on floors. Especially hard tile ones like the floor he was sitting on now. But the room didn\u2019t have any chairs, so he\u2019d have to deal with it anyways.</p>\n<p>There was a large stage in the front. Normally, there would be a podium and Mr. Stark would go up and announce whatever he was going to announce from there. Sometimes Pepper would do it for him too. Peter could no longer see the podium, so it was probably behind the curtain that was also there.</p>\n<p>It was a very stylish setup. It had to be, considering the room was constantly on TV and the press had almost complete free run of it. The floors where tile and the edges were wedged together so that there were no gaps between each square. There were many modern styled chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling above them. Like the entrance area, this room spoke luxury.</p>\n<p>Pepper walked in front of the stage, but not on it. Her heels clicked against the tile as she walked.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me introduce you to\u2026 Tony Stark!\u201d The woman announced to the group.</p>\n<p>There were a few cheers as the curtains opened up to reveal Tony. The man wore a more casual suit and put on the mask that the public saw. He stepped forwards with swagger, confidence, and indifference. The press definitely wouldn\u2019t be seeing this, but he had a reputation to uphold and it was basically habit by now.</p>\n<p>Tony could see Peter nearly sweating out of anxiousness. He wasn\u2019t surprised, but it really wasn\u2019t his goal anymore to embarrass Peter. The poor kid\u2019s face made him feel guilty.</p>\n<p>He stopped near the edge of the stage. Tony cleared his throat to keep his crowd waiting and to prepare for his talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Midtown. I heard you\u2019re the school for smart kids or something. Supposedly you get the highest SAT scores in the nation.\u201d Tony muttered like it was no big deal.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing most of you came here to see the tech side of Stark Industries. We have a lot to see. This company specializes in efficient energy, so we have tons of different branches of products based on that concept.\u201d Tony paused to take a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe sell a variety of devices, such as phones, tablets, laptops, and TVs. There is also a branch that specializes in making lab equipment and tools. Mr. Chemistry Teacher, you should definitely check those out.\u201d The billionaire suggested, pointing at Peter\u2019s teacher. \u201cWe also recently started a branch that specializes in prosthetics and different technology for hospitals.\u201d Tony finished talking about the company.</p>\n<p>There was a round of applause. Tony waited so he could talk about the next part.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, if you\u2019re not crazy about the wonderful tech, then you can still find something interesting. SI has something for everybody. If you just like to build stuff, we have our mechanics and manufacturers. If you like to invent, we\u2019ve got several large teams of engineers. If you just want to chill and make a bit of money, you can get paid to test our products. If you\u2019re still young, you can intern.\u201d Tony informed the class.</p>\n<p>There was more clapping from the excited group. He was done for the most part, now he just had to wait for that jerk to make a move.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t look much better than he had before his little speech. His complexion was slightly whiter and he was still sweating. He\u2019d have to make it up to the kid after the long field trip ended.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes anyone have any questions?\u201d Tony asked the class.</p>\n<p>The group stayed silent for maybe three seconds, then several hands simultaneously shot high in the air. Some students looked desperate to be picked, and others were waving their hands around. The billionaire noticed Eugene Thompson\u2019s hand among them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! You in the purple shirt. Fire away.\u201d Tony said, pointing at Flash. The boy looked taken aback that the man actually picked him. He spoke anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you accept personal interns here?\u201d He asked Tony.</p>\n<p>He contemplated on how to answer this question. Tony didn\u2019t know if Peter wanted anyone else to know, and he had already embarrassed the kid a lot. He didn\u2019t want to reveal something that Peter didn\u2019t want revealed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t take personal interns.\u201d Answered Tony truthfully. \u201cThat\u2019s bec \u2013\u201d The man was cut off by the bully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! I knew you didn\u2019t work with him, Penis!\u201d Flash shouted towards the back of the group where Peter was sitting.</p>\n<p>Pure rage filled Tony. To see it on a screen was one thing, but to see it and hear it in person was something else. That was his kid, no, his son damn it! He wanted to do something nasty to that guy, but he had to keep his cool.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me finish.\u201d Tony shouted sharply.</p>\n<p>His teeth were clenched, and based on the expressions of the students, they could all tell he was mad. Flash didn\u2019t look very brave at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept personal interns because I already have one.\u201d He corrected the boy, looking him in the eyes. \u201cI came to Peter before he even applied for an internship. He caught my attention for being so talented at such a young age.\u201d Tony explained.</p>\n<p>He double tapped the arc reactor to his suit. Tony, with Peter\u2019s help, had designed the new nano tech. It was much easier to get the suit on and it was easier to keep with him. The armor seemed to melt around his whole body as it slid into place. It looked great.</p>\n<p>Tony looked back at Flash with his helmet on too. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t like it when you call my kid by that name.\u201d He said almost threateningly.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss has suited up.\u201d Friday informed the team. That was the que, now it was time for action.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright everyone, suit up!\u201d Cap ordered, following the plan.</p>\n<p>They all hurried to their respective rooms to get their uniforms. Nat and Wanda were already in their outfits because of the training room scenario earlier. Sam and Clint hadn\u2019t bothered to change out of their suits either, so they were ready too.</p>\n<p>They were all meant to meet in the living room. It didn\u2019t take long, because they had to be quick if there was ever an emergency. Clint was staring longingly at the video game controller, and fiddling with the movable button. But he forced himself not to turn on the TV.</p>\n<p>There was only one person missing. Or rather, an Asgardian. Loki was already waiting in the designated meeting place, but his brother was not.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long does your brother take?\u201d Wanda asked Loki in disbelief. She would have thought he\u2019d be faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho knows? He likes being dramatic.\u201d Loki told her.</p>\n<p>Some frustrating and confused shouts could be heard from down the penthouse hallway. It sounded like Thor\u2019s voice based on how deep it was.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Thor walked in the living room. \u201cI cannot find Mj\u00f6lnir!\u201d He exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, brother. I thought only you could move it?\u201d The other Asgardian questioned.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently not.\u201d Thor replied, seemingly in thought. \u201cWhat about our red friend, from when Ultron attacked? Is he around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s doing his own thing on the other side if the country. He couldn\u2019t have moved it.\u201d Steve informed Thor.</p>\n<p>Thor looked very confused. He didn\u2019t know anyone else who could pick up his hammer. Only that person knew where Mj\u00f6lnir was. That also meant that they were technically worthy of ruling Asgard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you leave it last?\u201d Cap asked him. He seemed focused on helping Thor find the famous hammer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe it was the training room.\u201d Thor told him.</p>\n<p>Nat seemed surprised. If you knew her well enough, you could see her different expressions even if her face didn\u2019t change.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanda and I left Peter in there.\u201d She said.</p>\n<p>Everyone seemed to realize what she was trying to tell them. The Avenger\u2019s faces nearly mirrored each other. Peter was the one who picked up Mj\u00f6lnir? Could they really be surprised though? He was such an innocent and sweet kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think he would have taken it. Peter probably didn\u2019t even realize how significant it was that he could pick up your hammer.\u201d Steve mentioned. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t see it in the training room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d Thor answered.</p>\n<p>Loki didn\u2019t seem to believe his brother. \u201cHello, voice in the roof, where is Thor\u2019s hammer?\u201d He asked Friday.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears to be in the training room.\u201d She informed the team.</p>\n<p>Loki gave his brother a pointed look. \u201cGoodness brother, everyone is allowed to act stupid once in a while, but you really abuse the privilege. It\u2019s like you\u2019re missing an eye or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor ignored his brother and heading towards the stairs. He was skipping maybe four steps at a time, so it wouldn\u2019t take too long to get to the training room and retrieve his hammer.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYour kid?\u201d Flash questioned Tony\u2019s phrase. He seemed afraid, which he had every right to be. The boy had just messed, and had been messing, with Tony\u2019s kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Confirmed Tony. He was still staring straight at the boy\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, Tony Stark, sir.\u201d The man listened as Flash attempted to apologize. \u201cI was just\u2026 it\u2019s this game we play, we\u2019re sort of\u2026 uh\u2026 friends at school and all that.\u201d The boy lied.</p>\n<p>Everyone knew it too. Even if Tony hadn\u2019t watched the video surveillance of Peter\u2019s school, he would have know this boy was lying. It was written all over his face. He was even worse at lying than Peter was, which was certainly hard to accomplish.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah! The bully game. I\u2019ve heard of that one.\u201d Flash visibly paled. \u201cI know more about you than you think, Eugene Thompson.\u201d Tony said through his anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I know about that? I\u2019ve seen the video surveillance, all of it. You\u2019ve got nothing to hide from me.\u201d He interrupted the boy.</p>\n<p>Tony shook his head in disbelief. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even take one day off from hurting Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>The said kid didn\u2019t know how to feel about the situation. Mr. Stark was defending him! That alone made Peter feel protected and safe. He hadn\u2019t really realized that the man cared so much about him. It only made Peter idolize his mentor even more.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Mr. Stark was making a huge scene. He looked furious, and Tony Stark with emotions was a strange concept to the public eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis just absolutely blows my mind, aren\u2019t teachers supposed to look out for this sort of thing? When I was in school, you would have gotten suspended.\u201d Tony directed his statement towards Peter\u2019s chemistry teacher.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy father will hear about this! I\u2019ll tell him what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Flash attempted to threaten the billionaire.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to explain what you\u2019ve been doing to Peter.\u201d Tony responded. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand why you hate my kid so much!\u201d Tony went on. \u201cYou are kissing some seriously explosive dynamite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry! I promise I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d Flash apologized to Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right you won\u2019t! Otherwise, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll have a tough time getting into a good school.\u201d The angry man assured him. \u201cI don\u2019t want you in my tower anymore. They\u2019ll show you to the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony was pointing towards a group of people entrance to the room. No one noticed them there before, as they were too occupied with watching Tony. People gasped and whispered as they recognized the group.</p>\n<p>All of the Avengers were standing there, with Captain America standing in the front.</p>\n<p>They were watching as Flash debated on what to do. He knew that Tony Stark had dismissed him, but he really didn\u2019t want to leave. Eventually the stares of everyone made him realize that they were going to wait for him to leave.</p>\n<p>The bully stood up and awkwardly walked towards the Avengers. His head was hung in shame. Everyone in the room watched him walk. Flash could feel all the eyes on him.</p>\n<p>Once Flash and the team of heroes left the room, Tony looked back at the crowd. \u201cDo you guys want to see the new tech I added to my suit?\u201d He asked them, fully knowing their answer. Everyone listened intently as Tony told them about the nano technology.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you understand what you\u2019ve done wrong, son.\u201d Steve reprimanded Flash in his Captain America voice.</p>\n<p>They were all done embarrassing the bully for hurting Peter. He only deserved so much, and they had reached that point. They still had to make sure that Flash knew that what he did was wrong. He had to stop.</p>\n<p>Flash looked down at the ground. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He said in a disappointed voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019re going to have you wait over here while your class finishes up. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re hardly missing anything.\u201d Cap assured the teen. The boy only nodded to show he\u2019d heard. His head was still hung in shame.</p>\n<p>Steve led Flash to a row of chairs against a long wall. They were back in the entrance area, from the very beginning of the field trip. The boy sat down in one near the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cThor is going to wait with you until your class comes.\u201d Steve informed him.</p>\n<p>The Avengers left through the elevator, leaving Flash alone with Thor. He noticed the man was very big and muscular. Flash felt very small compared to the Asgardian. He looked up at the tall man.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to see my hammer?\u201d Thor asked him. The happy man was smiling, like he had no care in the world.</p>\n<p>After Flash left, Tony went into detail about the technology of his suit. He tried to explain it in a way that would make sense, but based on the confused stares of the majority of the class, they still didn\u2019t understand. There was a reason Tony didn\u2019t take on a teaching career. That, and because most children and teenagers annoyed him. Only one person stopped him from saying all children and teens.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all for today, Midtown! Pepper will lead you back to the main entrance.\u201d Tony announced to the group. The students looked bummed and disappointed, and there were murmurs of protest.</p>\n<p>He walked over to the teacher, who was behind his class as they were leaving. \u201cMr. Teacher, I\u2019ll be keeping this kid.\u201d He informed the man, pointing at Peter. Tony spoke quietly, knowing Peter wouldn\u2019t want his whole class to know he\u2019d be with him. The only reason that \u201cmy kid\u201d had slipped in the first place was because of Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Stark.\u201d The man replied. He was looking for Peter so he could get the boy, but Tony made him pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me know if there\u2019s any more trouble with that Flash kid.\u201d Tony instructed with a firm tone and warning look. The teacher clearly hadn\u2019t thought to do it all the other times, so hopefully this friendly reminder would do the trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Mr. Stark. I\u2019ll be sure that doesn\u2019t happen again in my class, and I\u2019ll bring it to the attention of Principal Morita.\u201d Mr. Larson assured Tony. Satisfied, he let the other man get his kid.</p>\n<p>Tony couldn\u2019t figure out what Peter was thinking as the boy walked over to him. He was clearly flustered from everything that had happened in the last few hours, but beyond that Tony couldn\u2019t tell.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d The kid asked.</p>\n<p>Tony put his arm around Peter\u2019s shoulder and started walking them towards the elevator. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let Eugene treat you like that, kid. You deserve way better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked up at him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to do that much. Everyone but Bruce did something to him.\u201d The kid protested with a whine to his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey didn\u2019t do anything either.\u201d Tony said matter-of-factly. They stepped out of the elevator and into the penthouse.</p>\n<p>Peter sighed at his father figure and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant, Mr. Stark.\u201d He whined again.</p>\n<p>Tony mentally chuckled at the kid\u2019s tone. He sat down on the cushy sofa in the abandoned living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my kid, Pete. Not anybody else\u2019s, just mine. Actually, I guess you\u2019re May\u2019s too, but that\u2019s beside the point. You\u2019re my kid, and I\u2019m not letting anyone get away with hurting you. Especially some immature ten year old punk who\u2019s jealous of you.\u201d Tony told his kid.</p>\n<p>The boy looked at him with confusion. He tilted his head in and scrunched up his face. It looked remarkably similar to a puppy\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not jealous of me. At least I\u2019m pretty sure he isn\u2019t, Mr. Stark.\u201d The boy fumbled with his words a little.</p>\n<p>Tony smiled at Peter. \u201cYou bet he is kiddo. I watched the footage. You aced an algebra test when he failed and then accused you of cheating.\u201d He explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s jealous Mr. Stark. He might just really hate me.\u201d Peter told him, denying the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see him when I called you my kid? If that didn\u2019t mean that he was jealous, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d Continued Tony.</p>\n<p>Pete seemed to be thinking hard about it. His face was scrunched even more now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot, kid. I\u2019m not surprised he wants what you have.\u201d Tony paused, not sure how to phrase the next part correctly. \u201cBut considering what you\u2019ve had to go through, I think you deserve a lot more.\u201d He said in a soft tone. They both knew what he meant.</p>\n<p>Peter looked up at him with his large doe eyes. \u201cYou think so, Mr. Stark?\u201d The kid asked, trying to judge Tony\u2019s expression very carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, kiddo. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2026\u201d Tony paused as he fiddled with his front pocket. This was the first time Peter noticed something was in there. \u201c...reinstalled the parachute in your suit.\u201d He finished, pulling out an incredibly tiny box.</p>\n<p>Peter imagined it could fit a ring just fine. But the man began to pull his suit out, and Peter didn\u2019t know how he could have possibly fit that in the teeny box.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one won\u2019t drown you.\u201d His mentor joked with him. Peter grimaced at the memory of nearly dying in the lake, but smiled at Mr. Stark\u2019s attempt to make him laugh. \u201cIt also fits into compact spaces.\u201d Tony added, as if Peter hadn\u2019t already noticed.</p>\n<p>The boy was already thinking of all the benefits of the suit\u2019s compactness. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry about someone accidentally seeing it in his backpack. Peter could probably just slide it into his pocket like Mr. Stark had done.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark, this is just\u2026 woah!\u201d The boy said, trying to describe what he thought of the upgrades.</p>\n<p>The surprise of getting his suit upgraded never seemed to get less exciting. It was like having Christmas several times a year. Hopefully it would never get old.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you expect, kid, I made it.\u201d Mr. Stark sarcastically said to him. \u201cAnything else you want me to add?\u201d Tony asked him.</p>\n<p>Peter was only half listening to Tony talk. He was enthralled with his suit and trying to squeeze it super tight in his hands. It was almost like a stress ball, except Spider-Man themed. Did they make those? They certainly made some strange merch with his logo on it, Peter honestly wouldn\u2019t be too surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, it\u2019s great, Dad.\u201d Peter said, not really thinking about it much.</p>\n<p>Tony froze.</p>\n<p>His mind started going crazy. What did he mean? Had Pete even meant to say that? Wait. Did this mean he thought of Tony as a father figure?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asked the clueless kid sitting next to him.</p>\n<p>The boy looked up at Tony, clearly confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked him back.</p>\n<p>The boy had noticed the short silence, but he didn\u2019t know what had caused it. He didn\u2019t mind as long as it wasn\u2019t an awkward one, which it wasn\u2019t. What was Mr. Stark talking about? Had he missed something? It wasn\u2019t often that Tony let silence hang over them, if Peter wasn\u2019t talking then his dad -</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d The boy said, finally realizing what he\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been thinking of Mr. Stark as his dad for a while now, and he must have let it slip. How could he have let that happen? Mr. Stark wasn\u2019t supposed to hear that.</p>\n<p>Peter suddenly felt very awkward sitting there. What was he supposed to do now? He had no idea how the man would react, and he didn\u2019t want to assume anything. That would just mess things up even more.</p>\n<p>He chanced a glance at his mentor. The man was smiling. He quickly mirrored Tony\u2019s expression. Peter didn\u2019t feel as out of place as he had moments earlier. It was a relief, and he felt himself relax.</p>\n<p>Tony reached out and pulled Peter closer to him. The kid felt Mr. Stark ruffle his hair in good nature.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s Dad now, huh?\u201d Tony asked the kid who looked up at him. He was still smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Peter trailed off, not knowing how to answer.</p>\n<p>Tony softly chuckled at his kid. Peter\u2019s grin widened in response.</p>\n<p>The two could hear banging above them, and the next moment, Clint fell out of one of the higher vents. He landed hard on the living room floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOof!\u201d Clint shouted as he hit the ground. He saw the duo watching him. Tony didn\u2019t look very happy at him. The billionaire had demanded countless times for him to get out of the vents. It was a lot like their situation with the coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi there.\u201d Clint said bluntly.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Apparently Mr. Stark had talked to May, because now he was staying the night at the tower, and it was only Wednesday. However, Peter wasn\u2019t complaining in the slightest.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d done a large portion of his homework, using Tony and his knowledge to his advantage. For the stuff that his mentor didn\u2019t know, like history, he went to Steve. When Steve wasn\u2019t around Peter would find Bucky and ask him.</p>\n<p>After dinner came and went, Peter decided it was the perfect time to go patrolling. It took a little while to get to Queens, but Peter didn\u2019t really mind. He returned someone\u2019s lost dog, a little poodle named Angel, who actually didn\u2019t seem to like him much. The owners were nice though, and he felt great after seeing how happy the family was when they were reunited with their last member. Peter also stopped a number of thieves, which there was an unusual amount of that evening.</p>\n<p>He stayed out until 10 o\u2019clock, and came back only because of his dad\u2019s insistence. Peter liked to stay out longer, when the real action happened. But May and Mr. Stark made sure their guidelines stuck. It was one of the compromises they\u2019d made in order for Peter to still be Spider-Man. Tony was normally more lenient with these types of things, but May made it clear that the rules would be followed, and his mentor definitely didn\u2019t want to get on May\u2019s bad side.</p>\n<p>The spiderling climbed in through the window to the living room, making sure to close it before hopping off the wall. Peter ripped his mask off, which was a relief. His face always felt free and refreshed when the air hit his skin.</p>\n<p>He looked in the cupboard to find a post patrol snack. Peter found an unopened box of his favorite protein bar in there. Then his eyes landed on the pudding cups. Protein bar or pudding cups? It wasn\u2019t a hard decision to make. Peter grabbed three pudding cups and sat at the counter to eat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was afraid you were going to choose the healthy snack.\u201d A voice came from the doorway to the kitchen. Shuri went into the cupboard and grabbed her own pudding cup.</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh uh.\u201d Peter replied with his mouth stuffed with pudding. He shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. God forbid we actually eat the nutritious foods that help our bodies grow.\u201d He said sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Absolutely not acceptable.\u201d Shuri agreed, peeling of the top to the pudding cup and throwing it in the trash bin.</p>\n<p>Shuri gasped. \u201cYou traitor!\u201d The teen exclaimed, pointing an accusing finger at Peter. The boy looked offended and confused. \u201cYou\u2019re eating the sugar free ones? How dare you betray me in such a way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they were the only vanilla ones we had! That doesn\u2019t count!\u201d Peter protested.</p>\n<p>Shuri gasped and held her stomach as if she had gotten stabbed. She pretended to fall to the ground dramatically. \u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d Was her only reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the real traitor! You\u2019re having the chocolate ones!\u201d Peter accused her. He mimicked Shuri and pointed and accusing finger at her too.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is that a bad thing? It\u2019s completely unhealthy.\u201d The girl argued, sitting up on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut if you have it once a day it\u2019s not.\u201d Peter challenged her.</p>\n<p>Shuri raised her eyebrow at him. \u201cDo you mean if you have a small piece of dark chocolate?\u201d She asked him, smirking at his inaccuracy.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m pretty sure it applies to chocolate pudding too.\u201d Peter claimed. He was slightly unsure looking at Shuri\u2019s smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you are confusion. America explain!\u201d She quoted the vine.</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to several studies, having a small piece of dark chocolate every day can be healthy, although this does not apply to milk chocolate pudding cups.\u201d Friday spoke up. \u201cDoes that answer your question, Mr. Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter could have sworn he heard some sass in the AI\u2019s voice. Shuri was laughing at him now. Great.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, thanks a lot Fri.\u201d He grunted in a very monotone voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime, Peter.\u201d She replied. Yep, that was definitely a sassy voice he\u2019d detected.</p>\n<p>Shuri was still laughing at him. She tried taking a few deep breaths to steady herself, but to no avail. The teen burst out laughing again moments later.</p>\n<p>Peter ignored her and threw away his three empty pudding cups. Shuri\u2019s was still on the counter, only half finished. He sat back on the stool and pouted as his friend kept laughing at him.</p>\n<p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened when another person entered the room. His jaw opened wide and he didn\u2019t do anything for a few moments. He\u2019d actually forgot he was here at the tower! Peter\u2019s mind went through a chorus of \u201cOh my God\u201d. He remembered that the man could see him, so he pulled himself together so he didn\u2019t look like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Mr. Black Panther King T\u2019Challa, sir.\u201d Peter greeted the King of Wakanda. He could hear Shuri stifle a laugh.</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa smiled at him. \u201cHello Peter, T\u2019Challa is fine.\u201d He told the thrilled teen. He was on a first name basis with the king of Wakanda! And he knew his name! He couldn\u2019t wait to tell Ned the next day.</p>\n<p>Peter realized he\u2019d been staring. He immediately stopped himself. He would not embarrass himself in front of the Black Panther.</p>\n<p>\u201cShuri, we will be leaving on Saturday evening.\u201d T\u2019Challa addressed his sister. He glanced at the clock near the kitchen table. \u201cIt\u2019s late, so go get some sleep soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shuri rolled her eyes at her brother. \u201cYes, Mom.\u201d She said. \u201cI have a belly to fill.\u201d Shuri added.</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa ignored her first comment. He glanced at the pudding cup and looked at Shuri disapprovingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should really try to eat healthier, Shuri.\u201d He paused, making a point to look at her from her head to her toes and back up again. \u201cIt would really benefit you.\u201d The king explained.</p>\n<p>Shuri looked offended, her mouth gaping at the insult. \u201cAre you telling me I\u2019m fat, brother?\u201d She yelled down the hall where her brother had disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m about a third of your size, you hippo!\u201d Shuri shouted again when an answer didn\u2019t come.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all muscle!\u201d T\u2019Challa yelled back down the hallway.</p>\n<p>Shuri looked annoyed in a way that you only get when you\u2019re around a sibling. Peter didn\u2019t want to interfere. He was afraid he\u2019d do something wrong.</p>\n<p>Shuri faced Peter. \u201cI\u2019ve got to show this man dawae to the door.\u201d She told him. He instantly cringed at the old meme.</p>\n<p>\u201cShuri\u2026\u201d He whined. It was truly painful to hear the meme aloud again. It reminded him of how much he and Ned had overused it when it first became a thing. Now he knew how MJ felt whenever she told them to stop and they didn\u2019t. He\u2019d have to apologize to his girlfriend later.</p>\n<p>Shuri ran down the hallway after her brother. In the following minutes Peter could hear lots of shouting.</p>\n<p>The only reason Peter had been there for a few extra minutes to even hear the yelling was because Shuri had left her pudding cup. It was only half gone and it wouldn\u2019t be any good to waste it. Peter threw it away empty.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Peter wasn\u2019t ready for his alarm to go off the next morning. He moaned, but reluctantly pulled himself out of bed, not wanting to be late for school.</p>\n<p>The alarm stopped buzzing. What? He hadn\u2019t even hit the button on the clock. Peter opened his eyes and was greeted to the sight if his familiar room in Stark Tower. Right. He\u2019d had an interesting day yesterday.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t excited to go to school. The rumors flew around quickly at Midtown, and people would be talking about him. Who knew what Flash would do. Hopefully he would stop harassing Peter, but the kid wasn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p>The sleepy teen groggily walked into the kitchen, where he\u2019d been able to smell breakfast since he\u2019d woke up. He squinted as he entered the room. The windows let in a lot of light. Considering how high up they were, and that the sun was still rising, it wasn\u2019t surprising.</p>\n<p>There were a few others in the room, but they were mostly doing their own thing. Steve, who was usually up first, had made breakfast for everyone. The super soldier was currently sitting at the kitchen table with some tea and a newspaper. Peter could almost invision reading glasses on the man\u2019s face. He probably would have laughed at the thought if he wasn\u2019t so sleepy.</p>\n<p>Peter gladly took enough to fill himself. That meant almost a quarter of all the food that Cap made for the whole team.</p>\n<p>The spiderling ate his breakfast as more of the Avengers woke up. Most of them were in the kitchen now, with the exception of T\u2019Challa, Shuri, Bruce, Clint, and Bucky. The ones that were there were either eating, or watching the news, which had been turned on at some point when Peter was eating. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t very loud, Peter hated the noise of someone droning on.</p>\n<p>The peacefulness of breakfast with his friends and family surrounding him was interrupted by a loud noise. Said noise came bounding into the kitchen and immediately attacked the pile of pancakes that Steve had made. On his way to the table, he grabbed the whole coffee pot again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey there, mini Stark. You don\u2019t think your old man would mind if I took this, do you?\u201d He addressed the boy.</p>\n<p>Peter was confused. Since when did Clint have so much energy in the mornings? Usually he was a dead man walking and wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone except Nat.</p>\n<p>Also, what was all of this \u201cmini Stark\u201d and \u201cyour old man\u201d about? Sure, the Avengers would toss around a word here or there referring to their relationship, but never to that level.</p>\n<p>Why was Clint asking him? His dad was sitting right next to him. It was probably Clint just being Clint.</p>\n<p>With his advanced hearing, he could hear Loki whispering quietly to his brother on the other side of the room. \u201cI thought you told me they weren\u2019t related, brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would absolutely mind, Legolas. Now put that thing back before I make you.\u201d Tony said with a warning tone.</p>\n<p>Clint grinned. \u201cSorry, no say can do. I have an energy level that needs boosting.\u201d The energetic man refused.</p>\n<p>Tony glared at him. \u201cI think you have plenty of energy, Barton.\u201d He opinionated. Clint took a sip out of the pot, probably just to spite Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cFriday, do the honors, would you?\u201d He ordered his AI.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss, I am afraid that the Barton Proof Coffee protocol has been disabled.\u201d Friday informed Tony. The man looked surprised, to say the least.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He took a moment to think. \u201cWho did you contact, Clint, because you don\u2019t have nearly enough brain cells to hack my AI.\u201d Tony questioned the other man.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a few friends at Shield.\u201d The man started, smirking. He was about to continue when he was interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet's be real here, Clint. I\u2019m your only friend at Shield.\u201d Natasha interjected their argument. Clint pouted before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoulson convinced one of his team members to hack into your system for me, although I heard it didn\u2019t take much convincing.\u201d Clint explained. \u201cAnd I have friends in other places too, Nat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean us? Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little far fetched?\u201d Tony denounced.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I have a wife.\u201d Clint muttered in defense.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t hold much on me anymore, Barton. I have a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d He reminded Clint.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have kids.\u201d Clint added. \u201cAlthough, I guess I\u2019m not the only one anymore.\u201d He said mischievously, looking in Peter\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah. Peter almost forgot that Clint had overheard his and Tony\u2019s personal conversation. This probably wouldn\u2019t finish well for the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! The man of ants introduced me to young Cassie!\u201d Thor boomed from the other side of the room. \u201cShe liked my hammer.\u201d He added, looking at Loki for what happened the previous day.</p>\n<p>\u201cChildren like everything, Thor. Don\u2019t let that get to your head.\u201d Loki explained to his brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about Cassie.\u201d Clint told them. Still looking at Peter. Everyone but Thor seemed to understand what Clint was saying. Loki noticed this and quietly whispered to his brother, explaining the obvious message he was missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Peter attempted to assure them. It didn\u2019t work in the slightest. Peter was a horrendous liar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all saw it coming, Peter. Tony is just such a dad to you.\u201d Rhodey commented. Peter blushed at the second sentence. He didn\u2019t really know what to say after that.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have time to say anything either. Peter checked the time and jumped out of his seat in a panicked state. After all the classes he\u2019d skipped due to being Spider-Man a few months ago, he was on thin ice. Only one or two tardies would have him in big trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow down there, underoos. I can get us there in time.\u201d Tony said, getting out of his seat. They left the rest of the team to their breakfasts, and headed towards the garage.</p>\n<p>Tony checked his watch. It would be close getting there on time. The duo got into the black Audi, which would be less obvious than some if the other options, and were on their way.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long for them to get onto the highway. There was a very good reason for that too.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark, slow down! You\u2019re going thirty miles past the speed limit!\u201d The kid told him in a panicked state.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I would get you to school on time.\u201d Tony calmly told Peter. He didn\u2019t look any less relieved at the man\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re breaking the law!\u201d The boy protested again. Sometimes Tony forgot how innocent the kid was.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d Tony carelessly said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could die, Mr. Stark!\u201d The kid looked even more panicked now, so Tony slowed down a little bit. But they were still over the speed limit.</p>\n<p>They got to the school twenty minutes early. Tony decided he wouldn\u2019t be speeding so much the next time he drove Peter to school, even if they were late.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, dude, did you just get out of Tony Stark\u2019s Audi?\u201d Ned asked him when he came out of the kiss and ride line. His friend\u2019s face was full of disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Ned. I thought you already knew about that?\u201d He asked the boy.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing is believing, my bro.\u201d He explained to Peter.</p>\n<p>When they got to Peter\u2019s locker, MJ was already waiting for them. Her nearly empty backpack was slung over one shoulder, and she had a book in her other hand. She looked up from her book as the two boys arrived, but didn\u2019t say anything. That was just how MJ worked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading The Color Purple again?\u201d Peter asked his girlfriend, recognizing the cover and book title. It was the book she reread the most, which Ned and Peter quickly noticed. According to MJ, it was what originally got her active into woman\u2019s rights. Peter had never read it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt brings the real world into perspective.\u201d She informed them.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike A Doll\u2019s House?\u201d Peter asked. She had talked a lot about that one too.</p>\n<p>She shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIn a sense.\u201d MJ didn\u2019t elaborate on what that meant. She was blunt and to the point.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are still up for coming to my house on Saturday, right?\u201d Ned checked. They were planning a Disney marathon, with all the older movies, which they all agreed were the better ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Dad said it was fine, so sure.\u201d MJ confirmed with him.</p>\n<p>Ned turned to Peter. \u201cWhat about you, Peter?\u201d He asked his friend.</p>\n<p>There was a split second where Peter could see MJ\u2019s eyes light up. Uh oh. \u201cYeah, Peter. What did your Dad say?\u201d</p>\n<p>He guessed he should have expected MJ to bring that up again. Everyone seemed to keep asking about him and Mr. Stark. While he liked what had happened, Peter didn\u2019t like the type of attention he was getting for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Peter asked her. He looked like a deer caught in headlights. Ned was quietly humming the next lyrics in the song he accidentally quoted.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try, Peter. Your stepmom already told me about it.\u201d She explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean Pepper? She\u2019s not my stepmom, MJ.\u201d Peter defended. \u201cAnd since when did you start talking to her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she\u2019s your dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, isn\u2019t she?\u201d His girlfriend pointed out, completely ignoring his second question. She wasn\u2019t going to give up anytime soon. Ned was looking back and forth between them rapidly as each of them spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Peter started, as he tried to come up with a decent excuse.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d MJ finished. She looked satisfied at winning that little argument. \u201cDon\u2019t make it seem like such a bad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s girlfriend went back to reading her favorite book, no longer paying attention to the two boys. She was still standing by them though.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019m really confused.\u201d Ned said to Peter with a shocked expression. \u201cDid MJ just say that Tony Stark is your dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d Peter told his friend. He nervously scratched the back of his neck, which he realized afterwards was pretty clich\u00e9.</p>\n<p>When Ned\u2019s eyes grew even wider, he realized the other boy thought something different. \u201cNot biologically, Ned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, ok. Well, we could all see you two bonding anyways.\u201d Ned seemed to calm down a little. That was strange. Just a few minutes ago he was freaking out about Tony driving him to school.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is insane, Peter! So are you calling Tony Stark \u2018Dad\u2019 now or something?\u201d There was the Ned that Peter knew.</p>\n<p>He blushed awkwardly. \u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d Peter admitted, a smile forming on his lips.</p>\n<p> \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p>\n<p>Peter walked home with Ned that day, like he normally did. The previous day had been an exception. He was talking about how boring their chemistry teacher was. Considering how Peter barely stayed awake in that class on a daily basis, he would have to agree.</p>\n<p>He unlocked his apartment door, and was surprised to see May already there. Normally she worked until much later, which left him alone for several hours. Sometimes he\u2019d take the metro to the tower and work in his and Tony\u2019s lab for a while to kill off some of that time.</p>\n<p>May was attempting to bake again. He didn\u2019t really know why she kept trying. It was a never ending process. May would bake or cook something, it would turn out horrible, she would stop for awhile, and then she would try again.</p>\n<p>The only exception to this cycle was when Peter had first met Tony. The man had been polite in saying that May\u2019s date loaf was good, but she became obsessed with the notion that she actually was good at it, and started making them all the time. He\u2019d gotten one in almost every meal for a month after the event. It finally ended when Ned made a revolted expression while eating one.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey sweetheart. I\u2019m trying to make that banana bread recipe that MJ suggested.\u201d She informed Peter. \u201cHow does it look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter set his bag down on a chair and went over to May. She opened the door to the oven so he could peek inside. It smelled horrible. It reeked way too much of banana, as well as burnt. The shape of the bread was also horrendously off. Whatever that was, it certainly wasn\u2019t banana bread.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we should stick to the supermarket brand, May.\u201d He told her. Peter felt horrible telling her this.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d She checked her \u201cbanana bread\u201d again. \u201cIt seems just slightly deformed, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d She added sarcastically.</p>\n<p>Peter was surprised she didn\u2019t bring up the smell, but then he noticed the wooden clip on her nose. That would explain it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be nice to have some of that while we talk, but I guess the grapes will have to do.\u201d May sighed in disappointment. She pulled out the container of grapes from the fridge, and set it down on the coffee table in the living room.</p>\n<p>May sat down on the sofa and Peter followed suit. He was reluctant to have a serious talk with May, but he wouldn\u2019t find a way out of it anyways. These moments reminded Peter of the difficult days after Ben\u2019s death, when they\u2019d sit down like this and talk to each other about their feelings and struggles.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s aunt put an arm around him and pulled Peter close to her. He instantly relaxed at her kind touch. He loved how comfortable and loved he felt around May. Peter didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do without her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long has Flash been bothering you?\u201d She asked him in a soft tone. She didn\u2019t want to upset him.</p>\n<p>Peter was silent for a few moments before he decided to answer. \u201cI think\u2026 since freshman year, maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>May hummed and nodded, rubbing her hand against Peter\u2019s arm in comfort. \u201cWhat does he do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing bad, May. I could handle it fine, really.\u201d He tried to assure her. But May could tell by the way he stiffened up that it wasn\u2019t completely alright.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me what he did, sweetheart.\u201d She softly told him.</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t answer right away. He appeared to be gathering his thoughts. His eyes were darting around and his eyes were slightly squinted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe would tease me sometimes.\u201d He started, still thinking about everything else Flash had done. \u201cAnd he liked to give me names.\u201d Peter added on.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of names?\u201d She asked him. May was hoping he would be more specific.</p>\n<p>Peter was reluctant to answer. He didn\u2019t want to freak May out and make her worry. She had too much going on to deal with this sort of stuff.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, inappropriate names.\u201d Peter answered. He really didn\u2019t want to go into detail. May could tell, her boy wasn\u2019t very hard to read.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you tell me, Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked down, shoved away his pride, and answered. \u201cPuny Parker.\u201d Peter told her. His voice lowered. \u201cAnd sometimes Penis Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>May felt empathetic for her nephew. She remembered her own high school days where she wasn\u2019t particularly popular either. May pulled him closer and kissed his messy mop of hair.</p>\n<p>Peter felt comforted by her gesture and relaxed again. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything, are you? Mr. Stark already made sure Flash won\u2019t bother me anymore.\u201d He pleaded. It wasn\u2019t likely she would, but if he was really hurt, no one would stop her from being a mother hen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess since Tony did that already, I don\u2019t have to anymore.\u201d May agreed. She would probably check in with Peter\u2019s school to make sure these things didn\u2019t repeat, but she wouldn\u2019t do anything directly.</p>\n<p>May knew that Tony was protective of the people he truly cared about, and that one of those people was Peter. May felt comforted and relieved that Tony cared about him as much as he did. Pepper had told May what had occured on the field trip once the group had left. Once May was slightly surprised about Flash, but she definitely not surprised at Tony\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d had her suspicions about Peter being bullied, but she\u2019d never gotten an answer about it until now. There were days when her nephew would come to their small apartment building looking sullen and depressed. Other days he would come home beat up, with bruises and cuts along his face, legs, and arms. When she discovered his masked identity, Peter brushed it off as something that happened during patrol. Now she knew better.</p>\n<p>Peter felt better knowing that May wasn\u2019t going to do anything to Flash. Like he told her, Tony had already taken care of it. There was really no point for her to do anything at this point.</p>\n<p>There was a few minutes of comfortable silence between the two. They both gathered their thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d May started, giving Peter a mischievous look. \u201cI heard you called Tony \u2018Dad\u2019 yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter moaned loudly, making his annoyance obvious. \u201cNot you too, May!\u201d He complained. May laughed and ruffled Peter\u2019s hair again. She couldn\u2019t ask for a better moment.</p>"
