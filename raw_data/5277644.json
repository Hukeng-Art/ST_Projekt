  "text": "<p>Harry and Draco broke up the day before they completed their Auror training.</p>\n<p>Although Harry felt a bit strange calling it a break up. Was it even possible to break up with someone he was never actually dating? But they\u2019d been sleeping together for nearly their entire Auror training so it felt to Harry that the end of their relationship (although, could he still call it a relationship?) should have some sort of label. Some sort of official way of saying that it was over.</p>\n<p>Shouldn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>Harry had no idea.</p>\n<p>Honestly, he was probably far too drunk to be thinking about this right now. And really, he had no idea why he was thinking about it at all. Why he felt like it even mattered one way or the other. It wasn\u2019t like there\u2019d been <i>feelings</i> involved, or romance, or any of that nonsense. Hell, most of the time they hadn\u2019t even managed conversations. Mostly there had just been a lot of orgasms, which was exactly what he\u2019d wanted. Auror training had barely left Harry with enough free time to do laundry or fire off the occasional cleaning charm around his house, never mind the sort of time and energy he\u2019d need for dating. And since he and Draco were already on the same hectic schedule, and they were two reasonably attractive young men, and both of them were single and would likely stay that way for the foreseeable future due to their workload, it made perfect sense to get what they needed from each other. That was all there was to it. Neither of them had been anything even close to <i>in love</i>. They met up, they got naked, they fucked, and that was that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019d worked out beautifully.</p>\n<p>But now, for all that it hadn\u2019t meant anything, when Harry looked across the crowded pub and saw Draco laughing with a group of other newly-promoted trainees, a tight twinge of something wistful and possessive curled through his chest.</p>\n<p>He looked away and took another swallow of his pint. Even if he didn\u2019t care for Draco in <i>that way</i>, they\u2019d still spent the better part of the last year in bed with each other. It was only natural that Harry had developed some measure of fondness for him, right? It was okay to miss him a little. Or maybe he just missed the sex? That was certainly understandable. It\u2019d been good sex. Really, really good sex. The best sex Harry\u2019d ever had. Well, the <i>only</i> sex Harry\u2019d ever had, to be fair. But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t tell it was above average. It was like cake, wasn\u2019t it? He didn\u2019t have to be some sort of, of <i>cake expert</i> to recognize when one was fantastic. Cake was cake, and some of it was really good, and when you took a bite of it, you just knew.</p>\n<p>Sex with Draco had been like that, sort of.</p>\n<p>Except now, shit, now\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI really want cake,\u201d Harry said glumly, staring into the bottom of his pint glass. He really should have compared sex with Draco to something less likely to give him drunken cravings. Quidditch, maybe? Oh, or chocolate.</p>\n<p>No, wait, fuck. Not chocolate, because now Harry wanted chocolate cake.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ron sighed from the seat beside him. \u201cNow I do, too. I wonder if Mum would make some for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Hermione said from just beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly one in the morning.\u201d She sounded very practical and startlingly sober, especially compared to the way Harry\u2019s thoughts had begun to ramble and they way Ron\u2019s words had gone soft and blurry around the edges. But Hermione was their Designated Disapparator and had been sipping ginger beers all evening, which, in Harry\u2019s opinion, weren\u2019t nearly as good without the rum in them. Hermione was a good friend and Harry appreciated her sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet she would,\u201d Ron said stubbornly. \u201cShe loves me. She\u2019d make me cake if I asked her to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at one in the morning,\u201d Hermione said, folding her arms over her chest. She leaned back in her chair and raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cBut go on, Ron, owl her. I\u2019ll have a good laugh when she sends you a Howler right back for waking her up at this hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron wrinkled his nose at that, but didn\u2019t argue. He turned to Harry. \u201cD\u2019you reckon Kreacher would make us a cake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably, if I told him to,\u201d Harry said, considering. Then he shook his head and frowned a little. \u201cBut we\u2019d probably have to wake him up, and then you wouldn\u2019t want to eat anything he made. He made me a casserole last week, and there was a pair of shoelaces baked into the middle of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron blinked muzzily at him. \u201cOn purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d Harry said with a shrug. He supposed Ron meant it as a question even if he didn\u2019t get the intonation quite right. \u201cI think he does it to get back at me. Can\u2019t disobey directly because, you know,\u201d He flapped one hand in a loose gesture, \u201cHouse-elves. The shoelaces casserole happened after I scrubbed the kitchen floor before he could do it.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t get rid of Kreacher, Grimmauld Place was his home even moreso than it was Harry\u2019s, but at the same time Harry didn\u2019t feel comfortable being waited on hand and foot. He\u2019d started out trying to take care of his own chores, and somewhere along the line it\u2019d evolved into an unofficial War of Housework, and Kreacher acted out if Harry got too far ahead of him. \u201cAnd anyhow you know how cranky he gets when we wake him up at odd hours. We probably can\u2019t trust him with a cake.\u201d He stared off into space for a moment. \u201cI bet I could make one, though. It can\u2019t be that hard.\u201d Hagrid had managed to make Harry a birthday cake that one year, hadn\u2019t he? And he didn\u2019t even have a proper kitchen in his hut to make it in. Unless he\u2019d gone down to the Hogwarts kitchens and done it there. Harry pictured Hagrid towering over a throng of bustling house-elves, leaning down over a house-elf-height counter and carefully piping \u2018Happy Birthday Harry\u2019 in cheerful green icing. He burst out giggling, then sobered as he remembered how good and chocolatey that cake had been. He nodded once to himself and announced, \u201cI\u2019m gonna do it, I\u2019m gonna make a cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Hermione muttered into her ginger beer, but Ron\u2019s eyes lit up and he nodded eagerly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he offered. He clumsily pawed at Harry\u2019s arm and said very earnestly, \u201cHarry, I\u2019m gonna help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <i>god</i>,\u201d Hermione said again, this time with feeling. She picked up her ginger beer, sighed, and put it back down.</p>\n<p>Harry was still nodding. \u201cAnd if it turns out poorly, we can get Hagrid to make us a cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron was nodding along with him. \u201cHagrid would do it, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for the love of\u2014I\u2019m not taking you to Hogwarts,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said and gave Ron\u2019s arm a comforting pat. \u201cOur cake will be fine. Hagrid\u2019s just, y\u2019know. A back-up plan.\u201d Also, Harry hadn\u2019t been for a visit in too long. Now that he\u2019d have more time after his promotion, he really should make time to go out there for a visit one Saturday. At least for tea. He drained the rest of his pint and stood up, wobbling a little when the room tilted around him. \u201cBe right back. I need the toilet and then I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d He hated the way Apparition made him feel as if he were being forced through a small tube, stretched out and sharply compressed at the same time; it felt about a million times worse if he tried to do it with a full bladder.</p>\n<p>He made his slow and careful way across the crowded pub, and then down the narrow little hallway at the back. He pushed into the men\u2019s room, the bright light briefly disorienting after the pleasant dimness of the pub\u2019s main room. He did his business and washed his hands and was about to leave when the door opened and Draco walked in.</p>\n<p>Startled, Harry jumped back clear of the door swinging inward, then laughed at himself. Draco smirked a little, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right there, Potter?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Harry said. He made to push past Draco to the door, and Draco caught him gently by the elbow, and Harry paused, looking at him. They were standing very close.</p>\n<p>There was a long, frozen moment where Harry thought, <i>Oh. He\u2019s going to kiss me now</i>. And then Draco leaned in and did just that. Well, all right, then. Harry kissed him back, because with Draco\u2019s mouth moving warm and insistent over his own, he didn\u2019t feel like he had a choice about it. Kissing Draco reminded Harry vaguely of <i>Imperio</i>, wonderful enough that the rest of the world went a little blurry around the edges, warm in a way that made Harry want to sink deep into it and never come back up again. It felt captivating and compelling and a little bit dangerous, and even though it\u2019d been happening for the better part of the last year, the thrill of it had never quite worn off.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d he said against Draco\u2019s mouth before pulling away, and Draco ducked his head and nipped at Harry\u2019s neck. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re alone in here. Might as well,\u201d Draco replied. He gave up on kissing and pressed his face into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck, inhaled unsteadily, and nudged their hips together until Harry could feel him half-hard against his thigh.</p>\n<p>And, <i>oh</i>. Okay. That was very much okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we agreed,\u201d Harry said even as he pushed Draco up against the wall. He kissed Draco again, hard and quick. \u201cWe agreed we\u2019d quit once we were promoted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot promoted yet,\u201d Draco pointed out, deftly unbuttoning Harry\u2019s trousers. \u201cCeremony\u2019s not til tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Draco was right. It <i>wasn\u2019t</i>, so that meant <i>technically</i> they were still trainees and their arrangement was still on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d said Harry as he attacked the buttons on Draco\u2019s trousers, yanked them open and tugged them down, \u201care a bloody genius.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snickered. \u201cRight, because you keep me around for my brains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI keep you around for your cock,\u201d Harry said, dropping to his knees.</p>\n<p>Draco started to say something else, but Harry opened his mouth and swallowed him as deep as he could and Draco ended up saying nothing but \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018Harry\u2019 and \u2018ohmygod\u2019 for the next five minutes straight. Harry could tell when Draco was getting close. His breath hitched and his fingers tightened in Harry\u2019s hair, and then he was gasping out a half-strangled groan and coming in long pulses over Harry\u2019s tongue while Harry licked and swallowed and sucked gently until he finished.</p>\n<p>Sighing, Draco untangled his fingers from Harry\u2019s hair as he slumped back against the wall, breathing hard, and Harry pressed a trail of open-mouthed kisses to the crease between hip and leg, nuzzling the soft skin there and breathing deep. If this was the last time he got to be this close to these tender, intimate parts of Draco, he wanted to remember every detail.</p>\n<p>Eventually Draco recovered himself enough to tug Harry to his feet, then turned him around and pushed him up against the wall, steadying him when Harry stumbled. He knelt down in front of Harry, very carefully placing his knees on the toes of Harry\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d Harry muttered, trying to push him off, but Draco clung to his hips and put more weight onto his knees to keep himself in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Draco scolded. \u201cYou may care little enough about the state of your jeans that you\u2019re willing to kneel on this awful floor, but these are my good trousers and I\u2019m not dirtying them up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re making my toes go numb,\u201d Harry complained, trying vainly to tug one foot free. \u201cIt\u2019s distracting.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be distracted; he wanted to enjoy every second of this.</p>\n<p>Draco arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cI can assure you that you\u2019re not going to care much about the state of your toes in a few seconds,\u201d he said haughtily.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned and flicked Draco\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>Draco frowned back at him, his hands loosely curled around Harry\u2019s hips. \u201cWhat was that, Potter? Because I could have sworn it sounded like, <i>Thank you, Draco, but you don\u2019t need to return the favor. I don\u2019t much feel like having a blowjob tonight</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Draco, I\u2019d really like to have a blowjob, please,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cAlso your hair looks especially nice today and is that a new shirt? It really brings out your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco put on a stern expression. \u201cTrying to sweet-talk me?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cI really want your mouth on my cock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you ask me so nicely,\u201d Draco said dryly, then licked his lips and mouthed gently at the head of Harry\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>And, oh, maybe it had been a mistake doing Draco first. When Draco went second, his eagerness and anticipation of getting his own orgasm made him rush. And that was more than fine by Harry, who liked it hard and fast and maybe a little rough like Draco got sometimes when he was especially overeager. But when Draco\u2019d already got his, he tended to go slow, took his time. Built Harry\u2019s pleasure bit by careful bit, until Harry was sweating and shaking, unbearably hard, could hardly think straight, could barely breathe.</p>\n<p>Draco took him in slowly, sucking firmly and backing off a little before sliding down another half an inch. By the time he\u2019d taken Harry all the way down, Harry was breathing hard, one hand pressed to Draco\u2019s shoulder, the other hand clapped over his own mouth as Draco pulled nearly all the way off, sucking firmly as he went, flicked his tongue over the tip of Harry\u2019s cock, then slid back down, over and over, punctuating his rhythm every three or four times by taking Harry as deep as he could and swallowing hard.</p>\n<p>A few minutes into it, the doorknob turned and the door started to open, and Draco lashed out with his wand and cast a strong <i>Colloportus</i> without lifting his mouth from Harry\u2019s cock. The door slammed shut the bare inch it\u2019d opened with a startlingly loud <i>bang!</i> and Draco\u2019s steady rhythm didn\u2019t even falter. Harry\u2019s eyes rolled back and he thumped his head against the tile wall. Draco\u2019s breath huffed around him in a soft rush as he laughed, pulled off and mouthed along the side of Harry\u2019s cock, murmuring into his skin, \u201cLiked that, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god <i>yes</i>,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cYou beautiful bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed again and took him back in, returning easily to his earlier rhythm. One hand slid up Harry\u2019s thigh to cup his balls and fondle them gently, and Harry let out a shaky moan before he clapped his hand back over his mouth. Whoever had tried to get in might still be lingering in the hallway, and the idea of someone standing right on the other side of the door made everything feel sharper, more urgent. Draco sped up little by little, licking firmer, sucking harder. Harry tapped frantically at Draco\u2019s shoulder as his orgasm loomed suddenly before him. Draco took him all the way down and sucked hard, and Harry let himself fall, everything around him fuzzing out in a burst of staticky pleasure, narrowing down to the hot wet suction of Draco\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>He was still trembling faintly with small aftershocks of pleasure when Draco pulled off and licked his lips again, made certain he caught Harry\u2019s eyes before he visibly swallowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry sighed, clumsily petting Draco\u2019s hair. \u201cThat was really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it was,\u201d Draco said, standing up. He was smirking faintly as he helped Harry to do up his trousers again while Harry continued to slump against the wall like a useless lump, and it occurred to Harry then that Draco was <i>far</i> less drunk than he was. \u201cNot a bad ending to our arrangement, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, giving him a broad smile. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Draco said, tucking his hands into his pockets. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s that, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Harry told him, cutting off the next thing he tried to say. \u201cC\u2019mere, you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pushed off the wall and tugged Draco forward, tipped his head up and kissed him almost chastely, a warm and lingering press of lips. He felt Draco melt against him, the way he always did when Harry kissed him gentle like this. His hands slid up Harry\u2019s chest and over his shoulders to loosely cup the back of his head, fingers scratching lightly through the hair at the nape of Harry\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said as he drew back and let go of Draco. \u201cThat\u2019s that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was smiling, something soft and warm and Harry must really be drunk, because Draco looked almost <i>affectionate</i> as he said, \u201cWell, Potter. It\u2019s been fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt certainly has,\u201d Harry agreed.</p>\n<p>He turned to the door, unspelled and opened it, and disappeared through. Harry heard a murmured <i>Confundus!</i> and then the door fell shut.</p>\n<p>The same wistful part of Harry that wanted to call the end of their \u2018relationship\u2019 a \u2018break up\u2019 also wished that their last time had been in a bedroom, with an actual bed and all the time in the world to say a proper goodbye. But it\u2019d been difficult enough to sneak Draco in and out of Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione living there; then Seamus and Dean had needed a place to stay while they searched for a flat of their own, and the sneaking became a little more of a challenge; and now that Hogwarts had finished classes for the year, Ginny and Luna had moved in as well, and sneaking Draco in and out was pretty much impossible. Most of the time Harry didn\u2019t mind having so many flatmates\u2014he\u2019d just be rattling around inside Grimmauld Place by himself otherwise\u2014but all the extra people meant that he couldn\u2019t see a way to have Draco over without being found out. And Harry had flat-out refused when Draco suggested sneaking him into the Manor. So for the last month they\u2019d been catching time together whenever and wherever they could: mostly in public toilets, a few times in closets and storerooms, and once, quite memorably, in the showers at work.</p>\n<p>He sighed to himself and washed his hands, flicked water from his fingertips and gave them a perfunctory wipe against the thighs of his trousers, and left the toilet. He was being ridiculous. Drunk and ridiculous and, okay, maybe a little bit afraid of being lonely, especially when all the people he lived with were paired off into couples. Between his hectic schedule and all the sex he\u2019d been having with Draco, he hadn\u2019t really had the chance to feel alone. But now\u2026?</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes at himself in the mirror and put it firmly from his mind. Tonight was about celebrating and he didn\u2019t want to end it moping and maudlin.</p>\n<p>When he returned to the table, he found that Pansy Parkinson had taken his seat and was deep in conversation with Hermione. Harry sighed a bit to himself. A number of strange friendships and relationships had blossomed between the different houses post-war when all the returning students in Harry\u2019s year had been put into their own 8th year dorm. Neville and Hannah Abbott were still dating even a year after they\u2019d left school, as were Terry Boot and Daphne Greengrass, and Michael Corner and Susan Bones. Ron had been delighted to discover that he and Theodore Nott were fairly evenly matched at Wizard\u2019s Chess, and they still met up for a game together every now and then, and Neville Longbottom had connected with Millicent Bulstrode over their mutual passion for Herbology and they still exchanged letters each week like clockwork. Harry and Draco hadn\u2019t had much to do with each other back during their final year of school, but they\u2019d done their best to set aside their differences and put the past behind them. By the end of the year they\u2019d become friendly acquaintances, enough that they were able to hold a civil conversation when they ended up in the same classes for their Auror training or when their increasingly intermingling social circles pushed them into each other\u2019s space outside of work.</p>\n<p>But Hermione and Pansy, bloody hell. Hermione and Pansy had spent the first half of the year circling each other like angry cats, and then suddenly they were the best of friends. Hermione had never explained what had transpired between them, and honestly the pair of them were sort of terrifying together, and Harry tended to not put himself in their notice if he could help it.</p>\n<p>Ron didn\u2019t seem to have any problem with it, but Harry rather suspected that had something to do with the amount of cleavage Pansy usually had on display.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Pansy say, half-turning in her chair. She tapped one long red fingernail against the rim of her glass. She made no move to give him his seat back.</p>\n<p>\u201cParkinson,\u201d Harry muttered. He looked around for an empty chair he could steal, and caught sight of Draco across the pub. Draco smirked at him before looking away, and Harry turned back to his own table before remembering he still needed a chair.</p>\n<p>Pansy snorted. Harry glared at her. She remained unfazed, but Harry supposed that was fair enough; she\u2019d been close friends with Draco Malfoy practically all her life, and Harry\u2019s glares weren\u2019t anywhere near as good as Draco\u2019s. Harry looked across the pub again, but Draco had his back to him. He was standing directly under a lamp, and the golden light made his hair practically glow, like some sort of, of. Well. Some sort of something that glowed prettily in golden light.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Hermione said. Her chair scraped the floor in a sudden clatter that rose briefly above the bustling sounds of the busy pub. \u201cPans, excuse me a moment. I\u2019m going to take the pair of them home and then I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said, finally turning around.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d Hermione said, taking him by the elbow. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but I\u2026\u201d He half-turned for another look over his shoulder but caught himself in time. Right. He and Draco had already said their goodbyes. And anyhow, they were going to see each other tomorrow afternoon at the promotion ceremony.</p>\n<p>\u201cCake, Harry. <i>Cake</i>,\u201d Ron said decisively. He stood up and led the way out of the pub, and Hermione pushed Harry along behind him.</p>\n<p>Oh, right. Cake.</p>\n<p>Harry followed Ron outside, and Hermione looped her arm firmly around his.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady, Harry?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Harry took a deep breath and nodded, squeezing his eyes shut tight as Hermione Side-Alonged him back to Grimmauld Place. She steadied him when they reappeared, keeping her hold on him until the room stopped tilting.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Hermione,\u201d Harry said. He started to lean in close to kiss her on the cheek, then remembered the last place his mouth had been and gave her a hug instead. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful.\u201d He sighed a little and leaned heavier against her. Her hair always smelled so good.</p>\n<p>She patted his back tolerantly until he let her go. \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d she said, then added, \u201cStep back, now. I\u2019ll have Ron here in just a moment,\u201d before she Disapparated with a soft bang.</p>\n<p>Harry obediently backed away to the doorway, leaving the center of the sitting room clear for Hermione and Ron\u2019s landing. He wasn\u2019t entirely sure what would happen if someone tried to Apparate into a space that was already occupied by someone else, but Harry had the feeling it\u2019d be messy and probably involve a trip to St Mungo\u2019s. He didn\u2019t think they had cake at St Mungo\u2019s.</p>\n<p>True to her word, Hermione only kept Harry waiting for a few seconds before she reappeared with Ron in tow. Ron leaned in close and murmured something in her ear that made her swat him away, but she was smiling as she did it and then she went up on her toes to kiss him. Harry looked away.</p>\n<p>Another soft bang told him that Hermione had gone again, and then Ron was crowding him out of the doorway and down the stairs to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do realize,\u201d Harry said as they reached the bottom, Harry a little faster than Ron on account of having missed the last step, but he was holding tight to the banister so he managed to keep his feet, \u201cthat this is probably a very bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged. \u201cKreacher won\u2019t let us burn the house down, probably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking of that,\u201d Harry said, pausing in the middle of the room. \u201cBut now I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Ron assured him. He already had the cupboards open and was rummaging around inside them. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, the fact that you keep saying \u2018probably\u2019 isn\u2019t all that reassuring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeeping all my hoops covered,\u201d Ron said. He pulled down a mixing bowl and set it aside on the counter. \u201cGet your arse over here, you\u2019re the only one of us who\u2019s any good in the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which was accurate enough but maybe not entirely true. Ron was entirely helpless in the kitchen, not because of a lack of talent but because he\u2019d never bothered making any attempt to learn. Instead, he subsisted solely on leftover takeaway and the heaps of food Molly packed up for him to take back with him every time he visited the Burrow, and Ron managed to find time to visit the Burrow at least twice per week. Harry didn\u2019t tease him about it because most of the time Ron was good enough to share with Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry did all right on his own, but he was still no Molly Weasley. He had breakfast down, but breakfast was easy. The rest of it could be a little hit and miss, so Harry mostly let Kreacher handle dinners.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry said. God, he was probably entirely too drunk to be attempting this. \u201cI\u2019m doing it. But if I burn down my house, I\u2019m blaming you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t burn down his house. He set several alarm spells to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t, the second of which went off in his ear as he was carefully removing the cake pan from the oven and startled him so badly that he dropped it. The pan upended onto the open oven door and while Harry stood there blinking stupidly at it, Ron, pragmatic as ever, scooped the crumbled remains back into the pan and they stood together right there at the counter and ate most of it just like that. It was good and very chocolatey even without the icing, but Harry couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he\u2019d missed an ingredient.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the best cake Harry\u2019d ever eaten, but it was more than good enough to satisfy a drunken craving, so he called it a success.</p>\n<p>By the time he and Ron finished eating, rinsed out the pan and cleaned up the crumbs from around and inside the oven, Harry was starting to sober up a little bit. He felt pleasantly tipsy and a little sleepy, and after bidding Ron a good night and left him heating up a kettle for tea as he settled back down at the kitchen table to wait for Hermione to return, Harry went upstairs to his room.</p>\n<p>He shut his door after himself and kicked off his shoes, nudging them neatly side-by-side against the skirting boards beside his wardrobe. Harry started to unbutton his shirt but halfway through he caught sight of his bedsheets lying twisted and rumpled over his bed, and even though it\u2019d been nearly two months since the last time he\u2019d had Draco over, it struck him hard that he was never going to have Draco here again. The tight wistful-possessive feeling twisted through his chest again as it sunk in that what they\u2019d had was over, really over.</p>\n<p>Strange that he should miss it, when he\u2019d never meant it to be more than easy sex. Honestly, it\u2019d started off as sort of an accident, where they\u2019d been arguing and then it just sort of\u2026 happened. Harry had been in the papers again one morning in late September, a full-page spread brimming with unfounded speculation about his love life. He\u2019d been in a foul mood ever since he\u2019d seen it, made worse by several of the other trainees ribbing him over it, even though Ron had done his best to make them stop. By the time they all trooped into the locker room at the end of the day, Harry was more than ready to be done with all of it. He lingered in his shower cubicle, eyes closed and steaming hot water pounding onto his back, until everyone else had left. </p>\n<p>Or, he\u2019d assumed everyone else had left. When he stepped out, towel clutched around his waist, he found Draco fussing with his hair in front of one of the mirrors. Ignoring him, Harry stomped over to his locker and got his clothes out, dropped his towel and quickly pulled them on.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Potter,\u201d Draco said, and mercifully he\u2019d waited until Harry had got himself dressed again before he\u2019d started talking. This was what passed for being friendly acquaintances with Draco Malfoy: he waited until Harry was no longer naked before he started acting like an arsehole. \u201cBusy night planned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Harry muttered, gathering up his things and stuffing them into his bag.</p>\n<p>Draco only smirked at him. \u201cReally, I\u2019m impressed\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you start, too,\u201d Harry snapped at him. \u201cYou know better. I <i>know</i> you know better.\u201d He crammed his bag into his locker and slammed it shut. He turned to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m just so curious,\u201d Draco went on, following him out the door. \u201cHow on earth have you got <i>so much spare time</i> to get up to all that mischief? I mean, my goodness. Over a dozen people have come forward claiming to have\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>haven\u2019t</i> got time, you arse, you know I don\u2019t. We\u2019re on the same training schedule and I\u2019ve barely even got time to sleep, much less get up to whatever lies they\u2019re putting around about my love life,\u201d Harry told him, walking faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo secretive,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWell, fine. If you don\u2019t want to tell me about your adventures\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ground his teeth together. He reached the lift and jabbed the call button. The doors slid open right away, and the relief he felt at not being stuck with Draco in the hallway as they waited for a car to arrive evaporated when Draco stepped into the lift with him and Harry realized that he was now stuck inside a very small space with him instead. He hit the button for the Atrium, then mashed it several more time in quick succession in the vain hope that it\u2019d make the lift move faster.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough,\u201d Draco went on, and Harry sighed and counted himself lucky he\u2019d got even a minute\u2019s reprieve. Though, knowing Draco, it was only because Draco wanted a moment to choose which direction to take this stupid conversation. \u201cI have to say I\u2019m a little bit hurt that you didn\u2019t. I thought we were getting to be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco waved a dismissive hand. \u201cWell. Be that as it may. You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019re friends with all those men and women with whom you\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry heaved a sigh. \u201cThere were no men and women, you know there weren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I do,\u201d Draco said, examining his fingernails with casual affectation. \u201cThe <i>Prophet</i> is a reputable source of information regarding current events and I\u2019m sure the editors would never ever publish lies in the interest of selling papers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d know all about that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Harry muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Draco went on as if Harry hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cWe all know that the <i>Prophet</i> is a paragon of journalistic virtue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed and shoved him in the vain hope that he\u2019d maybe shut up.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd credibility in journalism is so very important, especially in this day and age when society\u2019s most public figures go running about with all sorts of\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shoved him again and Draco shoved back and then their faces were suddenly very close together, and Harry froze. Draco blinked, and licked his lips, and didn\u2019t move away. His gaze darted down to Harry\u2019s mouth. And before he\u2019d fully thought about what he was doing, Harry leaned in and pressed his mouth against Draco\u2019s, and it was quite good to his surprise, Draco\u2019s lips were soft and warm, his cheek smooth and soft where the tip of Harry\u2019s nose nudged up against it, and\u2014</p>\n<p>He jerked back suddenly, because <i>he was kissing Draco sodding Malfoy, what the bloody hell was he doing?</i> \u201cSorry, sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco cut him off by jerking him in by the front of his shirt and kissing him again, hard and fast. And <i>that</i> was even better. Draco nipped at his lower lip and Harry opened up to him, let Draco push his tongue insistently against Harry\u2019s, and Harry\u2019s knees went a little bit weak. Draco lashed out with a fist and slammed the emergency stop button, and the lift jerked to a halt with a sudden jolt that sent Harry stumbling against the wall. He reached out and yanked Draco up against him and kept kissing him, pushed one thigh in between Draco\u2019s and found him wonderfully, temptingly hard.</p>\n<p><i>I did that,</i> Harry thought dizzily to himself, <i>That\u2019s for me.</i></p>\n<p>Draco groaned and rocked his hips against Harry, kissed him harder and deeper and slipped his hands around to cup Harry\u2019s arse to urge him closer. </p>\n<p>And Harry thought to himself, <i>fuck it</i>, and Apparated Draco straight to his bedroom.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had the vague idea they\u2019d keep kissing, and then there would be horizontal-ness and his bed and less clothing and more orgasms. Only, once they were actually there, Draco pulled away from him in surprise\u2014quite understandably so, Harry had just Side-Alonged him without so much as a by-your-leave\u2014and then they were standing there awkwardly, staring, and Harry found that he found he really had no idea what he should do next. And, strangely enough, Draco didn\u2019t seem like he quite knew either. They stared uncertainly at each other for a long moment, then Harry shoved a hand through his damp hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cErm. So.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Draco echoed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea what I\u2019m doing, sorry,\u201d Harry blurted out, because he might as well get that out there. It\u2019d become readily apparent soon enough. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t either,\u201d Draco said, then, \u201cWait. Do you mean you\u2019ve never snogged someone in a lift and then Apparated them into your bedroom? Or that you\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErm,\u201d Harry said. He\u2019d meant that he had no idea what he was doing here with his ex-nemesis-turned-friendly-acquaintance-turned-potential-sex-partner, but\u2026 \u201cI guess, both?\u201d He watched Draco curiously. \u201cWait. Which did you agree to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged, his gaze darting away. \u201cBoth, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said. He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Draco was a virgin. All sorts of rumors had circulated Hogwarts about what went on in Slytherin. And Draco was, well. Draco was Draco, and Harry had eyes that worked. Harry would\u2019ve guessed Draco would\u2019ve been fending off suitors left and right.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Draco said, then hesitated. \u201cAnd... you want to do this?\u201d He gestured vaguely.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d Harry said, and tried a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of Apparating men into my bedroom for no reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>But that made Draco frown. \u201cNo, I mean. Are you sure you want to do this <i>with me</i>?\u201d he asked. He watched Harry intently, his brows drawn together like Harry was a puzzle he was slowly working through. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve never been\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded, swallowing hard. \u201cI know. But I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said. \u201cOnly\u2026\u201d He frowned a bit. \u201cI always assumed you\u2019d want to wait for the right person. You\u2019ve always struck me as the sort who\u2019d want it to, I don\u2019t know, mean something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Or, it will be, when it happens. This won\u2019t change that. When I meet the right person, it\u2019s going to be special because of them, not because of what I have or haven\u2019t done before they came along. Anyone else I\u2019ve been with before them won\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d He laughed a little and swept a hand through his hair, ruffling it up. \u201cAnd honestly, when I do meet the right person, I\u2019ll feel better about it if I\u2019ve got some idea of what I\u2019m supposed to be doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded slowly, his tight expression easing a little. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said again, paused and licked his bottom lip. \u201cSo that\u2019s all this is, then? A bit of fun before you settle down?\u201d</p>\n<p>The quick peek of Draco\u2019s tongue swiping over his lower lip drew Harry\u2019s eyes and now he couldn\u2019t look away from Draco\u2019s mouth. He wanted very much to get back to the kissing but didn\u2019t quite know how to make that happen. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other and back again. \u201cWell, yeah. I mean, why not? It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve really got time for dating right now. And I\u2026\u201d He paused, swallowed, and looked Draco right in the eye. \u201cI want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want this too,\u201d Draco admitted, looking more honest and vulnerable than Harry had ever seen him before. He blinked suddenly, and smirked, looking instantly more like his usual self. \u201cI\u2019m not going to resist the opportunity to go to bed with the Chosen One. According to the <i>Prophet</i>, it promises to be quite the experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cShut up,\u201d he said, shoving at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me,\u201d Draco taunted, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Harry said and tackled him to the mattress and kissed him hard, because \u2018make me\u2019 was probably as close to an invitation as Draco would give him.</p>\n<p>And, oh, this was good. This was really good, pinning Draco to the bed and kissing him. Draco\u2019s hands slid down Harry\u2019s back and groped at his arse, and Harry got one of his hands up Draco\u2019s shirt and spread his palm over the smooth warm skin of his side. Draco wriggled beneath him, and then their hips lined up and a sudden shock of embarrassment swept through Harry at the thought that Draco could feel how hard he was. And then it registered that he could feel Draco just as hard against himself, and that was okay if they were both hard, no reason to be embarrassed at all in that case.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Draco breathed, rolling his hips against Harry\u2019s, and Harry groaned and tucked his face against Draco\u2019s neck, mouthing at the curve where his neck became his shoulder. His cheek pressed against Draco\u2019s neck and he could feel his pulse thudding hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry mumbled, and pushed his hand between them so he could cup his palm against Draco\u2019s erection. Draco rutted up against the press of his hand and Harry rubbed at him firmly, loving the broken little whimpers and moans he found he could coax out of Draco with nothing more than a bit of pressure on his cock.</p>\n<p>Draco kissed at Harry\u2019s temple, the closest bit of him he could reach. \u201cWait, wait a moment. We need to\u2014Fuck, Potter. We\u2019re both wearing too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that sounded like a brilliant idea. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here, you know. For your brains,\u201d Harry said, sitting back enough to strip off his shirt.</p>\n<p>Draco snorted as he fumbled with the fly of his trousers. \u201cYes, Potter, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why you\u2019ve brought me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry kept his eyes on Draco as he shucked off the rest of his clothes. One day, possibly one day very, very soon, he thought he\u2019d like to take his time and look, because <i>bloody hell</i> Draco was fit. But right now it felt far more important to touch instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we doing this?\u201d Harry asked. He reached out and slid his hand up Draco\u2019s thigh, and Draco shivered, his legs falling open.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have lube?\u201d Draco asked, which didn\u2019t exactly answer the question, but Harry obligingly fetched the bottle from his bedside table and pressed it into Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cTurn over,\u201d he said as he popped the cap.</p>\n<p>Harry hesitated, the thought of Draco inside of him suddenly overwhelming and a little scary. \u201cI, er, I don\u2019t know if I want to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked up at him. \u201cOh. Well. We don\u2019t have to\u2026 I mean, I won\u2019t go <i>in</i> if you don\u2019t want me to. But maybe I could just, you know, against you?\u201d He was blushing faintly as he said it.</p>\n<p>The thought of Draco rutting against him, everything slippery and wet, sounded much more appealing, and Harry found himself nodding. \u201cYeah, okay. That sounds.\u201d He took a breath and turned over, because if he looked at Draco for any longer he was going to kiss him and kissing was very nice and all but Harry was ready for things to move along. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUp on your knees?\u201d Draco said from behind him, and Harry heard him set the bottle back on the bedside table, followed by the slick sound of his hand moving over his cock.</p>\n<p>He pushed himself up on his hands and knees, feeling more and more urgent with each small, wet sound he heard from behind him. He wanted, he <i>needed</i>, but he gritted his teeth and refused to beg for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He gently touched his fingers against the edge Harry\u2019s hip, and Harry held his breath. And then Draco moved in closer behind him, and the slippery tip of his cock nudged up against Harry\u2019s backside, and Harry flinched.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and reached back to catch Draco by the wrist when he went to move away. \u201cUnexpected, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cHow on earth was that unexpected? I told you I was doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed a little, and it came out high and a little bit nervous, and Draco laughed with him, sounding relieved, like he felt better to know Harry was nervous too. And just like that, the tension broke and Harry\u2019s nerves settled. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said, tugging Draco\u2019s hand back to his hip. \u201cI\u2019m ready this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And this time when Draco pressed up against him, he didn\u2019t jump at the contact. He felt Draco reach between them and adjust himself, and then Draco gave an experimental thrust and his cock slid smoothly against Harry\u2019s arse, and Harry couldn\u2019t help but gasp.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>It got even better when Draco reached around and wrapped his slippery hand around Harry\u2019s cock, tightening his fingers into a fist, and stroked him a few times before he held still and let Harry fuck into his hand. Draco snugged up close behind him, his chest warm against Harry\u2019s back, his other hand sliding off Harry\u2019s hip to press possessively over his belly. He let Harry set the pace, following along with Harry\u2019s motion, rolling his hips in time with Harry\u2019s thrusts.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mind blanked out at that point, everything else falling away until his world narrowed down to the feel of Draco\u2019s hand on his cock and Draco\u2019s cock sliding against his arse. He gasped, crying out as Draco suddenly took over, thrusting against him faster and faster until his hips stuttered and he said, just once, \u201c<i>Oh</i>,\u201d and then he came.</p>\n<p>And it was the feel of Draco\u2019s come trickling down his thighs that pushed Harry over. He barely had time to think distantly to himself, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to do laundry tonight,\u2019 before his own orgasm hit and he came all over his sheets.</p>\n<p>Draco slid away from him, breathing hard, and Harry flopped over onto his back next to him and stared up at the ceiling, trying to slow his pounding heart and heaving lungs as he thought dizzily to himself, <i>I just had sex with Draco Malfoy!</i> and then immediately after that, <i>Holy fuck that was good!</i> And then it belatedly registered that he was lying in the wet spot of his own come and he shoved Draco to make room for him on the dry side of the bed, and then Draco shoved him back, and then their wrestling turned to kissing and they snogged until they were both hard again and then they had sex a second time and it was even better than the first.</p>\n<p>And it kept right on getting better from there as they became more comfortable with each other and learned what they each liked best and how to give the other what he liked best as well. And afterward, Draco never stayed and Harry never asked him to. Never <i>wanted</i> him to. They interacted in their Auror classes when they had to, conversations carefully kept to course material and occasionally Quidditch, talked to each other sometimes on the rare occasions they had the time and energy for socializing and their friends happened to drag them to the same event. Once they\u2019d bumped into each other while doing their shopping in Diagon and spent a whole five minutes voluntarily making polite small talk while they waited in line. But yeah, beyond that? It\u2019d just been sex.</p>\n<p>And that was fine. They\u2019d both got exactly what they wanted out of the arrangement. It\u2019d worked. Harry\u2019d been more than content.</p>\n<p>But now, climbing into bed alone, that small and wistful part of Harry couldn\u2019t help wishing that he had Draco here beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d he told himself, and pulled the blankets over himself, and turned out the lights, and was asleep in minutes.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t get the chance to exchange more than a brief hello with Draco amid all the whirlwind chaos of their promotion ceremony. And after that, after being assigned to different Senior Aurors with different caseloads and different schedules, Harry and Draco\u2019s paths rarely crossed in the Ministry. Their paths crossed slightly more often outside the Ministry\u2014their social circles were hopelessly intermingled by this point\u2014but it never went beyond a casual conversation here, a game of pick-up Quidditch there. Nothing else happened between them, they were never alone together, and by the time July rolled around, Harry had stopped missing the feel of Draco\u2019s body against his own.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d moved on to missing the feel of having someone\u2019s body against him in general, and a sharp and bitter loneliness had sprouted and grown until it felt like it was eating at him from the inside out.</p>\n<p>It\u2019d been six weeks since the last time he\u2019d hooked up with Draco, and that whole thing had only come about because he hadn\u2019t been able to date. But now that he was a Junior Auror, he finally had the time and energy to find a partner for real. Something fluttered warm and excited in the pit of Harry\u2019s belly when he thought about it. He was settled into his job and his schedule left him with enough free time that he felt like he could give a partner the time and attention he or she would deserve from him. It\u2019d be nice to find someone, a man or woman who\u2019d fall in love with him and want to share his life. He lived with three other couples who were very much in love, and sometimes it was a little hard to watch. Sometimes it got a little lonely being the odd man out. </p>\n<p>Maybe it was time to do something about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking maybe I\u2019d start dating,\u201d Harry announced one bright and lazy afternoon in mid-July. </p>\n<p>Ron put down his Quidditch magazine. Hermione looked up from her book. They exchanged a laden glance with each other.</p>\n<p>Harry frowned at them. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ron said. \u201cNothing at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho exactly have you got in mind?\u201d Hermione asked, not anywhere near as casual as she probably meant it.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at Ron suspiciously for a moment longer, then turned to Hermione. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know. I was thinking maybe that witch who works in at the coffee stand in the Atrium? She seems nice. She always smiles at me. I think she\u2019d say yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Hermione exchanged another look, this one even heavier with meaning than the first.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <i>what</i>?\u201d Harry snapped. It annoyed him when Ron and Hermione did their whole speaking-in-significant-stares thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ron said again. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d finally\u2026 Never mind. Nothing at all. I\u2019m glad for you, mate. Let me know what she says.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wasn\u2019t about to let them get off that easily, but Ginny came thundering down the stairs just then, shouting about how the Kestrals' Keeper had just been traded to the Cannons, and then Harry didn\u2019t have the chance to get a word in edgewise with how she and Ron were shouting at each other, and then he forgot all about it.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry asked out the coffee stand witch the following Monday, and, to his relief, she did in fact say yes. Her name was Marguerite, and she was quite pretty, with smooth skin and curly dark hair. They had their first date on Friday evening and Harry found that her smile was even lovelier from across a table than it had been from across the Atrium. She was smart and sweet, and when Harry made a small joke at her expense near the end of the night, she reacted like he\u2019d just slapped her across the face. Harry stumbled his way through apologies, trying to explain that all of his friends did that sort of thing to each other and it\u2019d just slipped out, and really if he was poking a bit of fun at her it only meant that he was comfortable with her and liked her a lot, but he was very sorry and didn\u2019t mean to upset her and promised not to do it again. And Marguerite forced a smile and said it was fine, really, don\u2019t worry about it, she\u2019d overreacted, everything was fine. But things weren\u2019t fine. Things were stilted and awkward for the rest of the evening and Harry felt like he\u2019d been a giant arsehole.</p>\n<p>The following Monday when Harry arrived for work, Marguerite didn\u2019t smile at him from across the Atrium, and Harry never made any attempt to arrange a second date.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry had another date about two weeks later, this time with a wizard named Kenneth, a friend of a friend of a friend whom he\u2019d met a few times in passing over the summer. Kenneth had the sort of bright and magnetic personality that made Harry feel like they\u2019d known each other for ages. He didn\u2019t seem overawed by Harry\u2019s fame, didn\u2019t treat Harry as anything other as normal. Harry was just debating to himself whether it would be too forward to invite Kenneth to come home with him after they finished dinner, when Kenneth suddenly mentioned how nice it must be for Ron, to be able to ride his best friend\u2019s coattails to greatness without the need for effort of his own. Harry excused himself to use the toilet and went straight home.</p>\n<p>Then he had a date with a witch named Maria, who spent the evening railing against their current political system and how it was rotten through and through and ought to be razed to the ground and rebuilt from scratch. Harry got the impression she thought he was somehow responsible for making this happen and was displeased with him that he hadn\u2019t managed it by now.</p>\n<p>Then there was Emily, who hated Quidditch, followed by Elizabeth, who spent a solid twenty minutes talking about her cat in a way that reminded Harry uncomfortably of Mrs Figg, followed by Mark, who wanted to take Harry home to meet his mother at the end of the evening to make sure she approved of Harry for a second date.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not looking for excuses?\u201d Hermione had asked him at that point, and Ron nodded along beside her. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not giving them a fair chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019d been Rachel. Harry had asked her to dinner, and Rachel had suggested a trendy restaurant down on Diagon. They were mobbed by half a dozen reporters in the middle of their meal and it turned out that Rachel had called them there herself. When Harry stood up and walked out on her then and there, she\u2019d burst into (very impressive but still extremely fake) tears for the reporters\u2019 benefit.</p>\n<p>He Apparated straight home and Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t say one single blessed word about <i>not giving her a fair chance</i>; they were far too busy being outraged on his behalf.</p>\n<p>\u201cI give up,\u201d Harry sighed, flopping backwards onto the sofa. He was trying not to think of what might appear in tomorrow\u2019s edition of the <i>Prophet</i>. He couldn\u2019t even imagine what Rachel might\u2019ve said about him after he left, but he had a feeling it hadn\u2019t painted him in a good light. He stretched, shifting over until his head ended up propped on Ron\u2019s thigh, and Ron rolled his eyes and gave Harry\u2019s forehead a conciliatory pat. He was much nicer than Hermione, who huffed and hit Harry\u2019s feet with her book until he removed them from her lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry so much about it,\u201d Ginny said, leaning over the back of the sofa to ruffle his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had bad luck at it, that\u2019s all. You\u2019ll find someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll never find anyone,\u201d Harry said, dragging a throw pillow over his face. \u201cI am going to die alone.\u201d It was now September and Harry had been going on dates for almost two months. The furthest he\u2019d got with any of them was with Maria, who\u2019d left him with both a goodnight kiss and a lingering sense of misplaced guilt over the current state of Wizarding politics.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo dramatic,\u201d Ginny said. She yanked the pillow away so Harry could see her roll her eyes. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s what\u2019s got you worried, why not let someone else find someone for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat up and blinked at her. \u201cLike who?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike me,\u201d Ginny said, grinning. \u201cI\u2019m a professional Quidditch player, you know. And that means I know lots of other Quidditch players. In fact, our Assistant Coach is single. She\u2019s a few years older than you and quite pretty. Fantastic thighs. Lots of time spent on a broomstick, you know.\u201d She winked at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said. Maybe this wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. If nothing else, they\u2019d at least be able to talk about Quidditch. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>They did, in fact, talk about Quidditch. Caryn was bright and funny and enthusiastic and Harry liked her right off, and they had a really fantastic conversation about how the different teams in the League were expected to do in the upcoming season. They talked about Quidditch on their second date, too, despite several of Harry\u2019s attempts to steer the conversation in other directions. For their third date, he refused to let her change the conversation back to Quidditch. And at the end of that date, she told him that she thought he was a wonderful guy, but she didn\u2019t feel like they had all that much in common.</p>\n<p>Harry thanked her for a nice evening, shook her hand, and put her in touch with Oliver Wood.</p>\n<p>Last he\u2019d heard from Ginny, they\u2019d hit it off spectacularly.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry saw Draco the following weekend when Ron and Ginny rounded up as many people as they could and trooped over to Hogwarts to watch the first match of the season. Slytherin was expected to win, but Hufflepuff wasn\u2019t making it easy on them. Ron and Seamus had smuggled in bottles of butterbeer and passed them around once the game started, and everyone drank and laughed and watched the match and Harry felt the loneliness abate some. He felt light and warm and happy, and he adored his friends so much.</p>\n<p>Draco had ended up in the seat directly behind Harry, and Hufflepuff had just scored to bring their score up to 40 against Slytherin\u2019s 60 when Harry felt a bony knee press against his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Draco said, leaning down and putting his mouth very close to Harry\u2019s ear, \u201cthe locker rooms are entirely deserted right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leaned back and Harry turned around to face him. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded seriously, then leaned in close again and murmured, \u201cYeah. What say you, once more for old time\u2019s sake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOkay.\u201d He drained the last of his butterbeer and tucked the bottle under his seat before he stood up.</p>\n<p>Draco was right; the locker room was deserted. They fucked quickly and made it back up into the stands just in time to see the Slytherin Seeker catch the Snitch.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Word had got around at the Quidditch match that Ginny\u2019d set Harry up on a date, and soon after that, not only did the rest of his friends hasten to get in on it, but it became something of an unofficial competition to see who could set Harry up on the best date.</p>\n<p>So far, they were all losing spectacularly.</p>\n<p>Luna set Harry up with an older wizard who\u2019d spent the entire date talking about the mating habits of hinkypunks. Which, when Luna did that sort of thing, Harry found it sweet and charming. When Cole did it, Harry found it overly-intense and a little bit intimidating. Especially at the end of the night when Cole informed him that Harry was infested with bissle-flips which were, apparently, drawn to those suffering from acute sexual frustration. He followed up that diagnosis with an offer to help him get rid of them. Harry told Cole he had a headache and went home early.</p>\n<p>Acute sexual frustration, his arse. He\u2019d just fucked Malfoy not three days prior.</p>\n<p>After Cole, Harry went out on a date with Tavares, who worked with Millicent. Tavares, it turned out, had been misinformed that he was agreeing to a date, and the evening ended in confusion and embarrassment when Harry tried to kiss him and Tavares informed Harry that he wasn\u2019t gay.</p>\n<p>Then Dean set Harry up with Sheila, who thought Harry was very nice but said she was moving to Canada next month and didn\u2019t want to carry on a long-distance relationship with a man she\u2019d just met. Next, Dean set Harry up on a date with James, with whom Harry had a very nice evening, shared a very nice goodnight kiss, and who then never called him back. After James came Francis, a friend of a friend of Hannah Abbott, who shouted at the waitress during dinner and made her cry. Harry apologized to the waitress, and walked out on his date then and there, and poor Hannah was mortified when he later told her what\u2019d happened.</p>\n<p>Then came Penelope, whom he\u2019d briefly met a time or two through Theo Nott. Nothing was wrong with Penelope, but nothing about her felt especially right, either. And in any case, she didn\u2019t seem especially interested in seeing him again. They parted ways on friendly terms.</p>\n<p>By this point it was nearly the end of October and Harry was beginning to feel quite discouraged.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave it to me, Harry,\u201d Seamus assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve got someone you\u2019ll love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Michael was tall, dark, and handsome. He had a winning smile and a firm handshake and Harry thought the date was going well, at first. There was easy conversation which quickly became flirting, and then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back early,\u201d Hermione said when Harry came storming through the Floo.</p>\n<p>\u201cDate didn\u2019t go well,\u201d he muttered, flinging himself into the armchair. God, he needed a drink. He flicked his wand and Summoned a bottle of pumpkin ale from where several of them sat on the end table, kept under a Cooling Charm.</p>\n<p>Hermione looked doubtful. \u201cDid you give him a fair chance? You were only gone for twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed as he popped the cap off his bottle and then took a swig. \u201cHe pretended to drop his fork and then tried to give me a blowjob under the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cUnfortunately yes. There wasn\u2019t even a tablecloth to hide what he was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI stand corrected,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cIt\u2019s for the best that you dropped his sorry arse. No one needs an exhibitionist in their lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Harry said, nodding emphatically. Public sex was only fun if there was the <i>risk</i> of getting caught, not the certainty.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry,\u201d Ron said, walking into the room. \u201cYou\u2019re back early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMichael doesn\u2019t deserve our Harry,\u201d Hermione said right away. \u201cAnd Seamus is no longer allowed to pick Harry\u2019s dates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged and settled onto the sofa beside Hermione. \u201cI thought you were off your rocker for letting him pick out a date for you in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis taste\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s dating Dean.\u201d He sighed and slouched down in his chair so he could kick at Ron\u2019s ankles. \u201cRon, why don\u2019t you set me up with someone? I trust you to pick out someone good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, mate,\u201d Ron said, shifting his legs out of range of Harry\u2019s, and batted away the bottle cap Harry flicked at his head. \u201cYou already know everyone I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Hermione spoke up. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got someone in mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Harry asked. He sat up a little straighter. \u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione hummed. \u201cLet me see if he\u2019s interested,\u201d she said. She had that look on her face that meant the gears in her brain were whirring right along.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cHarry. Do you trust me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let me arrange this for you, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Hermione knew him better than almost anyone else in the world. If Harry couldn\u2019t trust her, then who could he trust?</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m agreeing to a blind date under protest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d Hermione said with a nod. \u201cExcuse me now, will you? I\u2019ve got plans with Pansy this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned to Ron after Hermione had vanished into the Floo. \u201cDo you have any idea who she\u2019s got in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged. \u201cHermione\u2019s mind is a very intimidating place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d Harry said, and then Ron asked whether he\u2019d want to go out for a pint and Harry agreed, and it didn\u2019t occur to him until much later that evening that Ron had never actually answered his question.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Harry showed up for his date at precisely six o\u2019clock on Friday evening. And even though he was right on time, when he gave his name, he was informed that his date had already arrived and been seated.</p>\n<p>The restaurant was much nicer than any of the places he\u2019d chosen on his own when he\u2019d set up his own dates, with high ceilings and plush carpeting and sparkling crystal chandeliers. All the waitstaff wore immaculately pressed black robes, and a piano played softly in the background. He\u2019d dressed up a little, wearing his good jeans and a cable knit jumper and a set of forest green robes left open down the front, added at the last minute because he remembered Ginny saying they made his eyes look nice, but he still felt uncomfortably underdressed.</p>\n<p>The maitre d\u2019 led Harry across the main dining room, up a narrow aisle between rows of small tables draped in crisp white cloths and occupied by well-dressed witches and wizards eating posh food from fine china plates and sipping wine from fine crystal glasses. Harry spotted a familiar head of blond hair and had barely enough time for the thought, \u2018Oh, Draco\u2019s here too,\u2019 to form before he figured out exactly which table the maitre d\u2019 was leading him to. He had no idea what Hermione had been thinking, setting him up with Draco Malfoy, but she and Harry were certainly going to have words about it when he got home tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione set this up,\u201d Harry said in lieu of a hello. \u201cI had no idea I was meeting you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked up at him and frowned. \u201cPansy,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cIt was Pansy for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they did this,\u201d Harry sighed, dropping limply into the chair across from Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco sighed and rubbed a hand over his forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you can\u2019t believe they\u2019d do this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re both horrible. You knew that already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione\u2019s not horrible,\u201d Harry said. Because she wasn\u2019t, mostly. At least when compared to Pansy. \u201cPansy\u2019s the horrible one. Hermione\u2019s just convinced she\u2019s always right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2019s Pans,\u201d Draco sighed again. \u201cThat\u2019ll be Granger\u2019s influence, you know. She\u2019s become downright insufferable since those two joined forces.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, history hasn\u2019t proven Hermione wrong too often,\u201d Harry said. He idly flipped open the wine list.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept here,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Harry said, flipping the wine list closed again. He mostly had no idea what he was looking at, anyhow. The sort of wine he and Ron drank came in a box. \u201cWe tried it already. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco hummed. \u201cWell, to be fair, it didn\u2019t exactly <i>not</i> work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t go anywhere, either,\u201d Harry said, because it hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d grown to like Draco well enough, but the only spark of desire he\u2019d felt for him had been purely physical. \u201cIf we were going to fall for each other, wouldn\u2019t it have happened while we were\u2026\u201d He paused, glanced around, and lowered his voice, \u201c...fucking? I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, the sex was great. But nothing developed beyond that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco hummed again. \u201cAre you suggesting we tell them that we can\u2019t date each other because we\u2019d already spent close to a year in a secret ex-nemeses-with-benefits arrangement?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <i>god</i> no,\u201d Harry said, cracking a smile. \u201cCan you imagine what they\u2019d say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d never hear the end of it,\u201d Draco agreed, nodding. \u201cThe questions they\u2019d ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019d be an interrogation, and they\u2019d only try harder to set us up. They\u2019d be convinced they\u2019re right, that we\u2019ve got <i>chemistry</i> or some rubbish. So what do we do? Just go home tonight and tell them it didn\u2019t work?\u201d Harry pulled a face before he\u2019d even finished talking. \u201cNo, they\u2019d try to convince us that we didn\u2019t give it enough of a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Honestly, Harry</i>,\u201d Draco said in a perfect imitation of Hermione, and Harry snorted. \u201cBut\u2026 perhaps we <i>should</i> give it a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked at him. \u201cWhat? Are you really suggesting we date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd,\u201d Draco scoffed. \u201cWe just agreed that it didn\u2019t go anywhere. But what if we <i>pretended</i> to date for a while, then engineered a break-up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed, then stopped when Draco didn\u2019t laugh with him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Harry began. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026 Draco, it\u2019s a ridiculous idea. It just doesn\u2019t make <i>sense</i>. What would we have to gain from faking a relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Pansy will become absolutely insufferable if she thinks she\u2019s right, but she\u2019d also stop trying to inflict me upon every hapless single bloke she comes across. Quite frankly, I could use a break,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like the same?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said. His friends had been getting rather insistent with their matchmaking lately. Honestly, a reprieve from it sounded pretty good to him. If nothing else, it\u2019d give his friends some time to round up some more people with whom to set him up. Maybe some of them would be not-horrible, next time. \u201cYeah, okay, I\u2019ll give you that. So if I agreed to this, how long would we be pretending to date?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco hummed thoughtfully for a moment. \u201cUntil Christmastime, I think would be best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to pretend to date me for two months?\u201d Harry asked. He\u2019d imagined it\u2019d be a couple of weeks at most.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo months is a perfectly reasonable length of time,\u201d Draco insisted. \u201cLong enough for it to become serious, but not so long that we\u2019d be expected to be heartbroken about it ending.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d Harry said slowly, trying to imagine pretending to date Draco for that long. \u201cAnd anyhow, the holidays are a stressful time, maybe the pressure of our first Christmas as a couple would push us to the breaking point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking more that the holidays are a stressful time so our friends will <i>hopefully</i> be too busy with their own lives to nag us overmuch about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, nodding. \u201cThat too. Well, we\u2019re going to have a very amicable break-up. Maybe they won\u2019t worry overmuch about us if they can see we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Draco gave him said that he didn\u2019t believe <i>that</i> for a single second.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cWe should be so lucky.\u201d He flipped open the wine list again, then looked around the room. Shouldn\u2019t their waiter have come over by now?</p>\n<p>As if summoned by the mere thought of it, a waiter appeared beside their table in a swish of black robes, greeted them briskly and asked to take their drink orders.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I believe we\u2019ll have a bottle of wine,\u201d Draco said, plucked the list from Harry\u2019s hands, perused it for an instant, then asked Harry, \u201cIs a red all right with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny preferences?\u201d Draco asked, glancing back down at the list.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged again. \u201cNot really. All red wine tastes the same to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked pained, then turned to the waiter and rattled off something that sounded like French to Harry. \u201cFor our second date,\u201d he said after the waiter vanished, \u201cI\u2019m going to arrange for us to attend a wine tasting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t exactly think that\u2019d be his thing, but there\u2019d be wine so he could probably tolerate it. Besides, relationships were about give and take, weren\u2019t they? \u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019m free this weekend, just let me know when.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>They sat in silence for a minute until their waiter reappeared, uncorked the bottle of wine and poured them each a glass. They placed their orders and the waiter vanished again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWe're doing this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed a little. \u201cYeah, sure. I guess we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Draco, raising his glass and holding it out. \u201cTo our relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave him a grin and picked up his own glass. \u201cTo us having a very long and happy two months together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo months and one week,\u201d Draco corrected.</p>\n<p>They tapped their glasses together, a clear and musical note ringing out between them. They drank. It tasted like red wine, but Harry supposed that it must be a nice one because Draco\u2019s face did an approving sort of thing as he swallowed. Then Harry thought of Draco swallowing in other contexts and had to look away for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Why are we going to break up?\u201d Harry asked, setting his glass down. \u201cIt might not be a bad idea to start angling toward it from the beginning. You know, laying the groundwork to make it believable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged and set down his own glass. \u201cWell, what big, irreconcilable differences have we got that we can work with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged back. \u201cThe distance, maybe? If you won\u2019t move to London, I\u2019m sure as hell not moving to Wiltshire and living with your parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m planning to move to London next spring, anyhow. And Wiltshire isn\u2019t that far by Floo, we wouldn't break up over that. What about marriage. I want to get married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, so do I,\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cKids? I want a houseful of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hated being an only child. I\u2019d like to have three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good number,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI was thinking maybe four? But three would be nice, too.\u201d They frowned at each other for a long moment, then Harry suggested, \u201cWhich of us would carry them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured we\u2019d take turns,\u201d Draco said. \u201cOh, best have four, then. Make it even, two each.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWould you let me name our firstborn after a constellation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDepends which one, but okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd would you be all right with a long engagement?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a traditional Wizarding wedding? With a bonding spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t live in a house full of Gryffindors with my new husband, you realize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be gone by then, I\u2019m sure, if we\u2019re going to have a long engagement,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd anyhow, I think we\u2019re looking too far ahead. I don\u2019t think any of this would become a serious issue in just two months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI suppose I got a bit carried away with it. Still, there must be <i>something</i> we disagree on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure there is,\u201d Harry said. He took a large drink from his wine glass. \u201cYou know, this would be so much easier if you were still an arsehole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I were still an arsehole, no one would be trying to set you up with me,\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cCan\u2019t we just tell them we didn\u2019t get on and leave it at that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019d accept that without specific examples?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could tell them we\u2019re sexually incompatible? That\u2019s a sensitive topic\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich would only make them more determined to get details, first off,\u201d Harry pointed out. \u201cAnd second off, <i>ha</i>. That\u2019s so blatantly untrue I don\u2019t think I could say it with a straight face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I snore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry burst out laughing. \u201cWouldn\u2019t bother me. Seamus snores like a bloody freight train. Honestly, after so many years of that, I have a hard time sleeping when it\u2019s too quiet.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWell, I hog all the blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always too hot when I sleep. You\u2019d be welcome to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cUgh. Stop being so bloody perfect for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes and stretched out his legs under the table to nudge his feet up against Harry\u2019s. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to be spending quite a lot of time together. I\u2019m sure something will come up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll be driving each other spare in no time, I\u2019m sure.\u201d He frowned a little. \u201cThis is going to be strange, isn\u2019t it, spending all that time together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUs\u2026\u201d He gestured vaguely between them. \u201cYou know. I\u2019m pretty sure this is the longest conversation we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Harry pointed out, then grinned and couldn\u2019t resist adding, \u201cUsually we don\u2019t do much talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cAnother thing,\u201d he said, toying with the edge of his serviette. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should resume our previous arrangement while we\u2019re meant to be dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, surprised and more than a little disappointed. He\u2019d honestly assumed they\u2019d pick up where they left off, and he hadn\u2019t quite realized how much he\u2019d been looking forward to it until Draco said he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cOkay. Well. If you change your mind about it, let me know. I\u2019d, erm. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like that too, to be perfectly honest,\u201d Draco said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve made an excellent point: we hardly talked to each other before. And to convincingly fake a relationship, we should probably get to know each other. And I\u2019m not sure that we will, otherwise.\u201d He gave Harry a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re quite distracting, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I try my best,\u201d Harry said dryly, then sighed. \u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always right,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cModest, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their dinner arrived just then, and the conversation turned to work as they ate, and the evening sped by. They shared a panna cotta for dessert, and Draco insisted on paying, and then they walked each other outside and hesitated on the empty street.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to come home with me?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>Draco put on an exaggeratedly scandalized expression. \u201cWhat kind of man do you think I am, Harry Potter? Do you think I\u2019m <i>easy</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed. \u201cGood god, no. No, Draco, I\u2019d never accuse you of being easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shoved him, and Harry laughed again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou arse,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it like that. You said you didn\u2019t want to, and I won\u2019t press you about it. I just meant, you know, come back to mine for a cup of coffee or something. Someone\u2019ll probably be up, we could show them how well we\u2019re getting along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome other night,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to start off too strong too fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou know, I had a really good time tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did as well,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThis farce might even be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think it will. So, owl me the details and I\u2019ll see you on Saturday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll see you on Saturday,\u201d Draco echoed. He put out his hand, and Harry shook it, and then they both Disapparated.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Ron asked when Harry walked into the room.</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \u201cNot terrible,\u201d he said, hanging up his jacket by the door. \u201cDraco\u2019s arranging for us to go to a wine tasting on Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looked incredibly smug.</p>\n<p>And Harry had to turn away to hide his smile.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Saturday, to Harry\u2019s mild surprise, turned out to be quite enjoyable, and not just because he ended up pleasantly tipsy by the end of it. Harry hadn\u2019t been sure he\u2019d enjoy himself. When Draco\u2019d said <i>wine tasting</i>, Harry had imagined a group of men and women in stylish clothes standing around a well-appointed room, sipping from wine glasses and saying all sorts of intelligent things about what they were tasting, saying things like <i>I detect a subtle note of blackcurrants</i> and <i>this one\u2019s got an undertone of burnt oak</i> and a whole lot of other things Harry was pretty sure weren\u2019t actually involved in winemaking before elegantly spitting their mouthfuls out again.</p>\n<p>Instead, to Harry\u2019s surprise, it took place in more of an informal classroom setting, where participants sat at several large, round tables and a tall witch with dark skin and natural hair tied back with a colorful scarf explained the winemaking process and gave a brief overview about the different types of grapes and the regions where they were grown and then spoke more specifically about each of the six wines they tried. She was very bright and knowledgeable, and Harry had forgot how much he enjoyed learning new things without the pressure of homework or an exam looming at the end of it.</p>\n<p>Also, there was no spitting involved, which pleased Harry because he\u2019d always preferred to swallow, and the portions were so small that even by the end of the tasting Harry wasn\u2019t quite drunk enough to crack that joke to Draco. He wanted to, but wasn\u2019t quite sure where they stood with each other in that regard.</p>\n<p>When the witch running the class finished talking about the last wine, she invited everyone to stay and mingle and enjoy the rest of the bottles left over from the tasting. The trio of witches who\u2019d shared their table wandered off to speak more in depth with the instructor about grape-growing regions in Germany, and Harry and Draco were soon left alone. Harry cleaned out his glass with a quick spell and snagged a nearly-empty bottle of the wine he\u2019d liked best with a lazy <i>Accio</i>. The label was hard to read, done in an elaborately curling script and all in French, but he\u2019d remembered the little cartoonish centaurs prancing around the borders of the label.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Draco asked, holding out his glass for Harry to fill him up as well, and Harry poured him a generous serving. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFun,\u201d Harry said, pouring his own glass, but it turned out he\u2019d misjudged the amount and there was only a little wine left in the bottle, barely enough for a couple of swallows. \u201cAnd I learned a lot. Maybe I\u2019ll even pick the wine for our next dinner date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go that far,\u201d Draco said, reaching over. He plucked the mostly-empty glass from Harry\u2019s hand and pushed his own full glass across the table, and Harry smiled at him. Draco propped his elbow on the table and leaned in, all suave confidence as he went on, \u201cBut I\u2019d be more than happy to help continue your education. Say, on Thursday, eight o\u2019clock, at Le Coq Bleu? I can make us reservations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was smooth, Malfoy, very smooth,\u201d Harry said, laughing a little, and impressed despite himself how easily Draco had invited him out on a third date. He tapped the curve of his wine glass against the rim of Draco\u2019s and Draco gave him a smug look. \u201cYeah, okay. I\u2019ve got an early shift that day, so eight o\u2019clock\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Draco said. He lifted the glass to his lips and polished off the swallow of wine, and stood up. \u201cExcuse me a moment, I\u2019m going to see if I can find if there\u2019s any more of that sauvignon blanc.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that the one with the swimming mermaid on the label or the one with the laughing mice?\u201d Harry asked a minute later when Draco returned with a full glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe laughing mice, for fuck\u2019s sake, Potter. The mermaid one was a merlot. Which is <i>red</i>. And as you can see,\u201d He flicked his fingernail against his glass, \u201cthe sauvignon blanc is <i>not</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell how was I supposed to know that?\u201d Harry asked, struggling to not laugh and spoil his act. He enjoyed more than he should when Draco got all flustered and exasperated with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we just sat through a class about it?\u201d Draco pointed out. \u201cOr how about the fact it says it\u2019s not red right in the name? You do realize that <i>blanc</i> means\u2026\u201d He trailed off and narrowed his eyes at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry had hoped to hold on to his straight face for a little longer, just to see if Draco would keep going, but he couldn\u2019t keep the smile off his face.</p>\n<p>Draco huffed. \u201cYou arsehole,\u201d he said. \u201cShould\u2019ve known you\u2019re doing it on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said, not sounding even close to apologetic. \u201cBut your pronunciation goes all fussy when you go off about something.\u201d He tried to mimic the way Draco had said the name of the wine and mangled it horribly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy pronunciation is not fussy,\u201d Draco sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s correct.\u201d He slid a look at Harry as he took a sip from his glass. \u201cI do speak French, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>That gave Harry pause. \u201cWait, you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmhm. Fluently.\u201d Draco took another sip. \u201cAs well as passable Italian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the lost opportunities,\u201d Harry sighed. He idly traced a finger along the rim of his glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, you know,\u201d Draco said, nudging his hand away. \u201cThese are cheap glass, not crystal. And what lost opportunities?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor dirty talk,\u201d Harry said, and then realized he maybe shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said that. They\u2019d been getting along pretty well and he was a little afraid that bringing up their old arrangement might make things awkward, especially since Draco had been the one to not want to continue with it.</p>\n<p>But Draco only laughed. \u201cWhy Potter,\u201d he said, his voice warm and teasing. \u201cI had no idea you were such a Francophile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither did I, apparently,\u201d Harry said, relaxing again. \u201cAnd anyhow, it\u2019s not just the French. I bet the Italian would be fun too, even if you say it\u2019s only passable.\u201d He felt a nervous little thrill start up in the bottom of his stomach, and it caught him by surprise. He\u2019d poked a bit of fun at Draco dozens of times before and never reacted like this. But something about bantering with him about sex when they weren\u2019t actually having any made it feel illicit. Almost forbidden. And Harry\u2019d always got something of a kick out of skirting the rules.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose passable would\u2019ve been enough to get by with,\u201d Draco said, still smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if you\u2019d have known what I was saying, in any case.\u201d His smile widened and turned sharply amused. \u201cI could tell you anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could recite your shopping list and still make it sound sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, Potter,\u201d Draco warned lowly, leaning closer. He had one knee hooked over the other, and the toe of his shoe nudged against Harry\u2019s shin. \u201cThat sounds rather like a challenge.\u201d He flexed his ankle gently, rubbing lightly at Harry\u2019s leg through the heavy denim of his trousers.</p>\n<p>And, oh. This didn\u2019t feel quite like teasing anymore. This felt like flirting. A brief flash of panic zipped through Harry and made it hard to breathe for a moment. He and Draco had never really flirted, not even when they\u2019d been fucking twice a week. They\u2019d bickered some, poked a bit of fun at each other in what\u2019d passed for foreplay between them. It\u2019d never been like this.</p>\n<p>But this was fun. Harry was surprised by how much he was enjoying it, even if it wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere. Shame he hadn\u2019t worked this out back when it could\u2019ve gone somewhere. Missed opportunities indeed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much.\u201d Harry recovered himself a bit and forced a smirk. \u201cMalfoy, I could recite <i>my</i> shopping list at <i>you</i>, and you\u2019d take it as a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco moved his foot away and uncrossed his legs, picked up his wine glass and took a sip. \u201cVery true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what makes us so much fun, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeeps things exciting, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Harry agreed, resisting the urge to move closer to Draco. He\u2019d missed the small point of contact from the instant Draco had moved away and very much wanted it back.</p>\n<p><i>You\u2019re being ridiculous</i>, he told himself sternly.</p>\n<p>Except\u2026 maybe not quite so ridiculous when he stopped and thought about it. After all, most of his previous interactions with Draco had involved quite a lot of touching. It would make sense that he\u2019d have a bit of trouble transitioning from that to\u2026 well. To whatever this was. Friends, maybe? They\u2019d be spending a lot of time together over the next couple of months, and even if they weren\u2019t quite friends yet, there was a good chance they could get there by the time they faked their break up. Harry thought he\u2019d rather like to end up with a friendship at the end of it.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, he turned the conversation away from anything at all to do with sex. They talked a little more about work and how the rest of their week had gone as they finished their glasses, and by that time most of the other class participants had dispersed and the witch who\u2019d run it was going around the room and Vanishing empty bottles and collecting empty glasses into a basket.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Draco said, standing. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>They were both a little too tipsy to Apparate safely, so they agreed on a walk while they sobered up. They pulled on coats and scarves, and Draco took a few minutes to arrange his carefully around his neck and then tuck the ends into his coat before he led the way outside.</p>\n<p>Diagon Alley was quiet for a Saturday evening, with only a handful of witches and wizards strolling along the cobblestone street. A chilly breeze ruffled Harry\u2019s hair, and he turned up his collar and shoved his hands into the pockets of his coat, and his fingers closed on a handful of loose coins and a crumpled paper. He pulled out the paper to look at it and found a receipt from last March from the Tesco just down the street, for a loaf of bread, two bags of Doritos, and spaghetti hoops. Harry remembered neither buying nor eating any of it, which meant he\u2019d either been very drunk when he did it, or Ron had borrowed Harry\u2019s coat when he\u2019d gone out on a late-night food run on his own. Both were equally likely. Harry shoved the receipt back into his pocket, and did his best to suppress a shiver as another gust of wind washed over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Potter. You\u2019re such a Muggle sometimes,\u201d Draco chided.</p>\n<p>Before Harry could say a word, Draco whipped out his wand and poked Harry right in the nose with it as he cast a Warming Charm. The sudden rush of magic made Harry\u2019s nose tingle, and he sneezed twice in quick succession.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d he said, rubbing at his nose. \u201cYou did that on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMight\u2019ve,\u201d Draco said, tucking his wand back up his sleeve. \u201cBut you feel better now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Warming Charm had spread and wrapped snugly around him, as toasty-warm as sitting near a fireplace, as comfortable as Harry\u2019s favorite old Weasley jumper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll never admit it,\u201d Harry said, turning to walk up the street, walking slow until Draco fell into step beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t undone the charm,\u201d Draco pointed out, sounding more than a little smug. \u201cThat\u2019s more than answer enough for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Harry muttered and elbowed him, and Draco elbowed him back. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d he began.</p>\n<p>Draco looked over at him just then as they came to the next intersection and stepped out of the shadows the row of buildings cast across the pavement, and for a moment Harry was so distracted by the way the setting sun made Draco\u2019s hair glow rosegold that he nearly missed Draco asking, \u201cI know what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth had gone dry. He swallowed and shook his head. \u201cNothing. Never mind. I\u2026\u201d He smiled a little sheepishly and flattened a hand over his hair. \u201cSorry. Lost my train of thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed at him, and they crossed the street and passed back into shadow, and Draco\u2019s hair returned to its usual pale gilt, and Harry finally looked away. His fingers had curled up in his pockets to keep from reaching out and touching, crumpling up the receipt into a tight ball. He opened his hand and fidgeted with it, then mashed it down into the corner of his pocket.</p>\n<p>Maybe this whole becoming-friends-with-Draco would be more difficult than Harry had originally thought.</p>\n<p>No. It wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019d be okay. Before, when they\u2019d had their arrangement, Harry had learned to separate Draco into two parts. There was the distantly polite version of Draco that Harry saw in class and spoke with in public. And there was the warmer version of Draco, who still held Harry at arms length, but who also smiled more, laughed more, who teased him and touched him and whom Harry was allowed (and encouraged!) to touch right back. It\u2019d been difficult at first to keep the two versions of Draco apart from each other, and over the first few weeks Harry\u2019d had to stop himself more than once from reaching out at the wrong moments.</p>\n<p>But eventually he\u2019d settled into it, and this would be no different.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Draco said, catching Harry\u2019s attention. He nodded at a small cafe tucked between a stationery shop and an apothecary. \u201cFancy a cup of coffee to help us sober up?\u201d</p>\n<p>That sounded wonderful, and Harry had a quick flash of wrapping his hands around piping hot porcelain and the soothing way sips of sweet, frothy steamed milk would warm him all the way down to his belly. That\u2019d be a nice way to end their evening, he thought</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sounds good,\u201d Harry said, and Draco gave him a smile and opened the door.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>They went out on a few more dates over the next couple of weeks. Draco made reservations and they had a very nice dinner at the restaurant he suggested, and got coffee together again, sitting tucked at a tiny table in the back corner of that cafe on Diagon and wasting an entire afternoon talking about nothing in particular, and then one day when the weather turned unexpectedly warm for early November, they went for a long walk around Hyde Park and Harry listened to Draco pass vicious judgment on Muggle fashion that had Harry in gales of laughter.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until Harry took Draco to a Quidditch game that it occurred to him to wonder why he and Draco were bothering to go on what felt an awful lot like <i>actual</i> dates for all that they were just pretend, when really it would have been easier for them to tell their friends they were going out and then simply whiled away their afternoons or evenings individually. But then Puddlemere scored against Portree and the crowd went wild and Harry forgot all about it until after the match.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re getting to know each other, Potter,\u201d Draco said, slow and exasperated, when Harry brought it up to him later as they were saying their goodbyes for the evening. \u201cThat is the point of dating, you know. To get to know the other person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yes,\u201d Harry said, nodding. \u201cExcept for the part where we\u2019re not <i>actually</i> dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco sighed, sounding even more exasperated. \u201cWe\u2019re not. But all of our friends think we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got that,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat was the whole point of this.\u201d He paused, and Draco stared at him, and Harry sighed and continued, \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, our friends aren\u2019t here right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not right now,\u201d Draco agreed. \u201cBut what do you think would happen if they finally see us together and we don\u2019t seem any more comfortable than we were before we started dating? We\u2019d give ourselves away. So we need to actually get to know each other, and we might as well do things that are interesting while that happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it sort of made sense when Draco put it like that, except for the fact that\u2026 \u201cDoing interesting things while getting to know each other is exactly what dating is, you do realize,\u201d Harry pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is the definition of it, yes,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry waited for any sign that Draco realized at all how bloody ridiculous this whole thing sounded. But it never came, so he said, \u201cSo\u2026 let me see if I understand what you\u2019re telling me. Our fake relationship involves going on real dates so that we can get to know each other well enough that our friends are reasonably convinced we\u2019ve been actual-dating this whole time, except we\u2019re not, but we\u2019re very convincing about it because of all the dates we\u2019ve actually been on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco huffed and folded his arms tightly over his chest. \u201cWell it sounds stupid when you put it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure it sounded stupid when you explained it, too,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes perfect sense,\u201d Draco insisted. \u201cAnd anyhow, it\u2019s whatever we say it is. We know our dates aren\u2019t real, so they\u2019re not. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re getting so worked up over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Truthfully, Harry didn\u2019t either, because when had arguing about anything with Draco Malfoy ever been anything other than a massive waste of time? He sighed and shoved at his hair even though it flopped right back over his forehead the moment he dropped his hand. \u201cFine. Whatever you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smiled and patted his cheek, and Harry rolled his eyes at how obviously pleased Draco was to have won the disagreement, even though Harry had very obviously let him win and that <i>so</i> didn\u2019t count as a real victory. \u201cKnowing when to stop arguing with your better half is a very important skill,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make someone very happy someday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish,\u201d Harry muttered, swatting his hand away. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a little bit sad that my not-dates with you have gone about a thousand times better than any of my real ones with other people did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sign,\u201d Draco said sagely, nodding a little to himself. \u201cA sign that I am so much better than everyone else. I am the best, and I\u2019m so glad you finally realized.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed and shoved lightly at him. \u201cYeah, okay. Clearly that\u2019s what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwice in a row!\u201d Draco crowed, smiling bright enough to practically outshine the sun. \u201cI had no idea you could be so agreeable, Potter!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m plenty agreeable,\u201d Harry protested. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed with you about plenty of things before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but let\u2019s be honest, many of the things you\u2019ve been agreeable about in the past have included suggestions like: <i>Shall we swap blowjobs?</i> or <i>Fancy a quick fuck?</i> or my personal favorite, <i>Bend over, Potter, I\u2019d like to see whether I can make you come from just my tongue in your arse</i>.\u201d Draco folded his arms over his chest and raised his eyebrows, challenging Harry to disagree.</p>\n<p>Which Harry couldn\u2019t, because who on earth would say <i>no</i> to having Draco\u2019s tongue in their arse. And even though Draco had been right about it, Harry rather thought he\u2019d come out ahead on that one. He flushed a little at the memory. \u201cAre you calling me easy, Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a long look that Harry couldn\u2019t describe as anything other than a leer. \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly for you,\u201d Harry said, then felt his face flush warmer when he heard exactly how that sounded. \u201cI mean, because you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever been with, not because I still want\u2014I mean, not that I <i>don\u2019t</i> want, because of course you\u2019re\u2026 Oh, fuck. This isn\u2019t coming out properly. I\u2019m going to shut my mouth now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Draco said, smothering his laughter under a tone of heavy sympathy. He gave Harry\u2019s shoulder a little pat. \u201cI know I\u2019m irresistible. I have that effect on people. It\u2019s an incredible burden but I\u2019ve learned to live with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an arsehole,\u201d Harry told him, trying his best not to smile. That\u2019d only encourage Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat too,\u201d Draco agreed, and then his smile edged into a smirk. \u201cSee? I gave you that one. Look how generous I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed despite himself. \u201cYeah, yeah. Okay. You\u2019re the most wonderful fake-boyfriend I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, speaking of what a wonderful fake-boyfriend I am,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI was thinking that we\u2019ve been out on enough individual dates that maybe it\u2019s time we show our friends how happy we are together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome over this Friday,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll those terrible freeloaders who live in my house are getting Thai and watching terrible horror movies. I think Neville and Hannah are joining us too, and that pretty much covers all my friends. Then we can do all your friends at the next pub night Pansy organizes.\u201d He thought it\u2019d be easier to take them on one group at a time rather than intermingled or, god forbid, all at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cHorror movies?\u201d Draco echoed.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, yeah. Movies are\u2026 Well, television\u2019s this Muggle thing\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d Draco broke in. \u201cBut <i>horror</i> movies? Halloween was almost two weeks ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cYeah, I know. Dean and I thought it\u2019d be fun to show everyone, you know, seasonally appropriate and all. But then Seamus and Ron got sort of hooked? So it\u2019s sort of become a Friday night thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. \u201cWell, all right. That sounds like the perfect opportunity to convince them our relationship is progressing nicely. And the movie should provide a convenient distraction should it go poorly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Harry said faintly, frowning a little as he tried to imagine how it\u2019d go. Movie nights tended to be somewhat rowdy, and he couldn\u2019t quite picture how Draco would fit into all of that. Plus, this would be the first time they had to play pretend-couple around people who actually knew them. Fake dates in public were one thing, because those were in front of strangers, but this time they\u2019d be pretending in front of Harry\u2019s closest friends in the world. He was afraid they\u2019d take one look at the two of them together and instantly know it wasn\u2019t real, and then Harry would have to explain it all, and quite frankly the whole thing was fairly ridiculous when he stopped and thought about it for more than two seconds. Oh god, the look on Hermione\u2019s face as he tried to stumble his way through an explanation that sounded halfway reasonable. And <i>oh god</i> the things Ginny would <i>say</i>. She\u2019d laugh herself sick and then never let him hear the end of it. And Ron\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Potter,\u201d Draco said, and the spiral of Harry\u2019s thoughts screeched to an abrupt halt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cDo you remember the Yule Ball in fourth year?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Er, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember when you had to dance in front of everyone with Patil?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remember it? Harry felt a flash of embarrassment and panic just <i>thinking</i> about it. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had that same look on your face just now,\u201d Draco said. \u201cSo I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He paused and broke out in a grin. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s rather exciting, isn\u2019t it? This is our first trial we\u2019ll have to overcome as a <i>couple</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Harry muttered. He hadn\u2019t thought of it quite like that, as a test he\u2019d have to pass.</p>\n<p>Draco flung an arm around his shoulders. \u201cNo, no. This is a truly momentous occasion\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry said, trying to shrug him off, but Draco held on tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our debut together. Our first official outing. Our chance to shine. We\u2019ll convince them all how sickeningly in love with each other we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a little shake. \u201cNo, no, no, they need to see. We have to show them how deliriously happy we are together.\u201d He held on tighter when Harry tried to pry him off, and grandly proclaimed, \u201cBecause we <i>are</i>, Harry Potter, we are <i>so happy</i> and we shouldn\u2019t hide our love away for any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, enough!\u201d Harry said, laughing and pushing him away, and this time Draco let it happen.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s big stupid grin dialled back to something small and pleased. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p>\n<p>And yes, actually. Harry found that he did. \u201cYes, you loon,\u201d he said, giving Draco another gentle push, and Draco let himself be rocked before swaying back to bump his shoulder against Harry\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And it would. They\u2019d been on dates. They knew each other better now. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d have to fake much of anything, or keep a bunch of lies straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo agreeable,\u201d Draco said, and Harry huffed. \u201cWhat time on Friday should I arrive? And should I bring anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing but your pretty face,\u201d Harry said dryly, and laughed when Draco preened. \u201cWe usually meet up around six for dinner, and then watch the movie right after.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d Harry told him, and a low flutter of warmth in the pit of his belly made him stop and think about it. He would look forward to it. He enjoyed spending time with Draco. And he really had nothing to worry about, did he? Everything really would be fine.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>The doorbell echoed through the house at five til on Friday evening. That had to be Draco; anyone else would\u2019ve let themselves in without ringing the bell. Draco could do that as well, Harry set the wards to allow him entrance a long time ago, but he was probably being cautious, Harry figured. As far as everyone else knew, this was the first time Harry had invited Draco round to Grimmauld Place.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it!\u201d he shouted, pounding down the stairs. He jumped the last two and got a running start so he could slide the last stretch of polished hardwood on his socked feet.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, when Harry levered himself up onto the troll\u2019s foot umbrella stand and peeked through the transom window, he found himself looking down on a head of very blond hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d Harry asked when he opened the door to Draco standing on his doorstep with an armload of flowers and chocolate and wine. \u201cI told you that you didn\u2019t need to bring anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled and flushed as delicately pink as the stalks of gladiolus blossoms he held in the crook of one elbow. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited to your home for dinner,\u201d he said, his voice startlingly formal. \u201cIt\u2019s only polite to bring gifts for the hosts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Are you nervous about this?\u201d Harry asked, lowering his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, absolutely not. I\u2019m just trying to be polite,\u201d he said stiffly as Harry took a step back to let him in.</p>\n<p>Harry snorted and nudged at Draco, trying to get him to loosen up a little. \u201cThey\u2019ve all met you, Malfoy. They know better by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled at him again and shoved the flowers into his hands. \u201cMake yourself useful and put those in some water, you ungrateful lout.\u201d He began to unbutton his coat.</p>\n<p>Harry thought about telling Draco to relax, but that wouldn\u2019t help matters any if he was already this waspish. He sighed and went into the formal dining room to find a vase. Hermione was in there already, setting the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, those are lovely,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cDraco brought them for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, plopping them down on the table before he went rooting around in the buffet for something to put them in. He came up with a blue glass vase.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, Granger,\u201d Draco said, stepping into the room. He\u2019d taken off his coat to reveal a blue cable knit jumper that did exceedingly nice things for his complexion. He came closer and shoved the wine and chocolates at Hermione. \u201cThank you for having me over, these are for you,\u201d he continued like he was reciting from a book.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Draco,\u201d she said, accepting them and putting them down on the table where they were immediately set upon by Ron, who\u2019d managed to materialize and lay his hands on the chocolates barely a second after they\u2019d been set down. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do this with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Draco said, shuffling aside as Ron pried the lid off the box. The look he gave Ron was sidelong and deeply unimpressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe've known each other for years,\u201d she said, reaching over and giving Draco's arm a friendly pat. \u201cSo you can drop the formalities with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, nodding a little to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he told her, and glanced sideways at Harry as if daring him to remark on the fact that Draco Malfoy had just admitted Hermione Granger was correct. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re all strangers here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the formalities are what made you show up here with chocolates,\u201d Ron said, his mouth half-full, \u201cyou\u2019re more than welcome to keep \u2018em up with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to steal my man, Ron?\u201d Harry asked, as he filled up the vase with an <i>Aguamenti</i>. He set the vase in the middle of the table and arranged the stalks into something resembling symmetry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Ron said, popping another chocolate into his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good thing going if he\u2019s bringing you chocolate. Hermione never buys me chocolate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your appetite,\u201d Hermione told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill not,\u201d Ron said, but he put the lid back on the box anyhow. \u201cWe\u2019re having Thai. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to ruin my appetite for Thai.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was probably true. Harry had seen Ron devour one of Molly\u2019s Sunday dinners over at the Burrow, and then come home afterward and work his way through a whole container of Thai takeaway. Other people could always make room for ice cream and other desserts; Ron Weasley could always make room for red curry or spicy beef.</p>\n<p>And speaking of Thai food, before Hermione could say anything else about Ron or his appetite, the front door banged open and Harry heard Neville and Hannah chattering to each other, plastic bags rustling in the background.</p>\n<p>\u201cFood\u2019s here!\u201d Ron said cheerfully, then stuck his head into the hallway and bellowed up the stairs, \u201cOI! FOOD\u2019S HERE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Moments later, several sets of feet thundered overhead and then pounded down the stairs. Ginny burst into the room, followed closely by Seamus and Dean.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you make sure to get\u2014?\u201d she began to Neville, and broke off when she caught sight of Draco. \u201cOh, Malfoy!\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you. Here I was, thinking that Harry\u2019d made the whole thing up just to get us off his back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry inhaled and choked on his own spit. Draco walloped him on the back, which didn\u2019t help Harry at all, and <i>why</i> did people think that <i>hitting</i> helped someone to stop coughing? He pushed Draco away and tried to stop coughing before Draco could hit him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is a shame,\u201d Ginny went on, talking loudly over the sounds of Harry choking. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ve found someone you\u2019d really hit it off with. Another Quidditch player, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, his voice coming out croaky. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m quite happy with Draco, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d Dean said, squeezing by Ron and Hermione to help Hannah begin unloading foil containers of takeaway and arrange them on the table. \u201cMalfoy\u2019s fit as any Quidditch player.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice legs,\u201d said Ginny.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice arse,\u201d Dean corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>right here</i>,\u201d said Draco, turning pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like maybe I ought to be jealous,\u201d Seamus said, then made a show of leaning back to ogle Draco\u2019s backside. \u201cBut I\u2019m really not.\u201d</p>\n<p>He winked at Malfoy, and Harry, who\u2019d only just stopped coughing, launched into a fresh fit to cover up his laughter when Draco looked over Dean\u2019s back at him and gave him a perfect expression of <i>did-that-just-happen?</i> Luna swept into the room just then, having descended the stairs at a much more reasonable pace, and without a word she crossed the room and hugged Draco tightly, her hands stroking up and down his back, the crown of her head tucked just beneath his chin, and Harry lost it all over again and the expression of startled confusion Draco shot him. He held his arms stiffly out from his sides, as if unsure whether to hug her back. He eventually settled for awkwardly patting her shoulder until she let him go.</p>\n<p>Which she did, eventually. She gave him a smile, then stole a spring roll and wandered out of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Draco said helplessly.</p>\n<p>And, yeah. This was going to be a lot more fun than Harry\u2019d thought. He smiled at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re all just messing with you.\u201d He paused considering. \u201cExcept Luna. I\u2019m not sure what that was, but I think it\u2019s a good thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely a good thing,\u201d Ginny said, then gave a triumphant little <i>ah-ha!</i> as she unearthed the spicy cashew chicken from one of the bags.</p>\n<p>Luna swept back into the room with a handful of spoons and forks, and made her way around the table, placing them by the different containers, and everyone sat down. Serving was a messy, rambunctious affair, as it always was. Harry took pity on Draco, who looked a little overwhelmed at all the shouting and grabbing and the threats, good god, the threats. Ginny and Ron both took their Thai food very seriously and Ron was apparently still holding a grudge from the last time they\u2019d ordered takeaway and Ginny had stolen the last spring roll right out from under his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Harry murmured, taking Draco\u2019s plate and leaning into the fray to serve him up a bit of everything. He pointedly ignored the smug looks Hermione was sending him from down the table, probably thinking how sweet it was that Harry was taking care of his boyfriend.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Draco said as Harry set the plate down in front of him.</p>\n<p>Harry waited for him to follow up with some crack about him being such a gentleman, or about their relationship, but it never came. In fact, the ridiculous arsehole Harry had been fake-dating for three weeks now had vanished entirely, replaced by the Draco whom Harry had come to know since the end of the War. He remained mostly quiet through the meal, coolly polite when spoken to, or breaking in with a pointed barb here and there at Harry\u2019s expense. But other than that, he lingered at the edges of the conversation as he polished off everything on his plate in small, neat bites.</p>\n<p>At first, Harry wondered whether he was nervous. This was sort of an intimate setting, having dinner at Harry\u2019s house with all of his housemates. But as Hermione had pointed out to Draco, they\u2019d all been around each other plenty of times before. He knew these people, had gone to school with them and grown up with them. There was no reason for him to be acting any different\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026.except, no. He <i>wasn\u2019t</i> acting any different for them. He\u2019d only started acting different when he was around <i>Harry</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco whispered, nudging his knee against Harry\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked, startled from his thoughts. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, quickly looking down at his plate. \u201cSorry, lost in thought for a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked at him. \u201cUnfamiliar territory?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flashed him a little smile, and how strange that Draco smirking and making smart comments at his expense had become a comforting routine. \u201cShut up,\u201d he said, and all right, that wasn\u2019t the best come-back Harry had ever made.</p>\n<p>Draco smirked harder at him and, to Harry\u2019s baffled disappointment, let it go.</p>\n<p>Frowning, Harry returned his attention to the conversation, where Seamus was shouting, \u201cBoris Karloff!\u201d over and over, and oh good. The negotiations for what they would watch tonight had begun. Harry didn\u2019t much care, so he leaned back in his chair and watched the debate unfold.</p>\n<p>Ron was pressing for one about a girl who could turn into a cat, which Hermione instantly vetoed, and then Ron and Seamus vetoed another one about a circus of vampires, claiming they needed to be extremely drunk before they tackled that one. Neville was pushing for one about murderous plants from space, but was outvoted by everyone except Hannah, and everyone unanimously agreed to skip the one about a giant snake terrorizing Cornwall. Eventually they settled on something called <i>The Deadly Bees</i>, which, bless the creative talents behind that title, was exactly what it sounded like.</p>\n<p>Draco had watched the shouting and bickering with some amount of baffled amusement, and when the group eventually came to a consensus, he leaned close to Harry and murmured, \u201cThis happens every Friday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cYeah, mostly. Ginny\u2019s usually a lot louder, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny punched him in the shoulder as she passed by on her way to help Hermione bring drinks up from the kitchen, and Harry waited until she\u2019d gone out of sight before he winced and rubbed at his arm, and mostly ignored the way Draco snickered at him. Harry gave him a halfhearted glare. If he kept on hanging around, it\u2019d only be a matter of time before Ginny started whacking him too. Ginny had no qualms about defending herself from insults and teasing with her fists, and Harry thought that Draco\u2019s smart mouth would be making a bold reappearance once he got a bit more comfortable. At least, he hoped so.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Harry said, starting for the kitchen as Hannah and Neville set about packing up the leftovers while Luna and Dean started clearing away the dirty dishes. \u201cYou can make yourself useful and help me carry up butterbeers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Down in the kitchen, Hermione loaded them up with bottles and they all trooped upstairs to where Harry had turned the formal parlor into a comfortable living room, appointed with big squashy sofas and a large tv set up against the wall opposite the Floo. He set his armload of bottles onto the coffee table and laid a Cooling Charm over them, kept one for himself, and flopped down in his usual spot on the far sofa. He jumped a little when Draco settled down practically on top of him, so they were pressed together along their thighs and shoulders. Draco made a small sound of irritation, then nudged at Harry\u2019s arm until he lifted it up, confused, and Draco slipped in right underneath it.</p>\n<p>Oh. Okay, then. Harry dropped his arm hesitantly around Draco, and Draco immediately snuggled into his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Ginny cooed. \u201cLook at how cute you two are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snagged a throw pillow and flung it at her. \u201cShut up.\u201d He glanced down at Draco and, to his surprise, found that Draco was blushing, the faintest hint of a blush spreading across the apples of his cheeks. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMy friends are all horrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged, and for a moment Harry thought Draco was trying to get him to remove his arm, but when Harry shifted to give him space to leave, Draco settled himself more firmly against his side, so Harry left his arm draped over Draco\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI have met them all before, you know. Also, my friends are horrible too, and by \u2018friends\u2019 I actually just mean \u2018Pansy.\u2019 Who, admittedly, is only one person, but she\u2019s so horrible she makes up for it. Regardless, the point remains: I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone else joined them a few minutes later and settled into their usual spots: Hannah and Neville curled together in the oversized armchair, Dean and Seamus joined Harry on his sofa while Ron and Hermione took the other, and Luna sat by them with her feet tucked up beneath her on the cushion and Ginny on the floor in front of her because Luna liked to weave Ginny\u2019s hair into elaborate loops and braids as she watched anything on television.</p>\n<p>Hermione flicked her wand at the television and the movie started. The opening scene showed a couple of policemen discussing a death threat from a beekeeper, calling him a nutter before they disregarded the threat entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cBit like the Ministry, yeah?\u201d Ron commented, rolling his eyes, and Harry sighed, because here they went.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, that one comment quickly devolved into a scathing commentary about the current state of Wizarding politics that lasted well through the next scene. Thanks to his evening out with Maria, Harry even had some excellent points to bring up.</p>\n<p>Draco patted Harry\u2019s leg as he nodded, agreeing with a point he made, and then left it there, fingers curled softly around the top of his knee. And little by little it slipped until by three scenes in, his palm was pressed to the curve of Harry\u2019s inner thigh. Draco\u2019s eyes never wavered from the screen, and he didn\u2019t seem at all aware of where his hand had moved to. And maybe it was wrong of Harry, but he let it happen, and for a while he let himself pretend that this was real because it felt so nice. Everyone else was paired off into couples and usually he sat here by himself and tried to ignore the ache of how much he wished he could have someone by his side. That ache had grown sharper and deeper with each failed date Harry went on, and he hated it. His friends were happy and he wanted to be happy for them, and lately he\u2019d begun to feel jealous when he saw them together and happy and in love.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s pleasure at having Draco tucked warm and snug against him suddenly soured, because as nice as this felt, it wasn\u2019t <i>real</i>. He shifted in his seat, stretching his legs out in front of him and crossing his ankles, and Draco removed his hand.</p>\n<p>Then Seamus pulled Harry away from his thoughts by hollering, \u201cDoris, you saucy minx!\u201d at the woman on the television screen, and Draco laughed, shaking against Harry with the force of it as Hannah added, \u201cI don\u2019t blame Doris, I\u2019d go up to the farm and <i>help him out around the house</i> anytime,\u201d which Harry found about twice as funny as he should have just because it came from <i>Hannah Abbott</i> who looked so innocent most of the time until she broke out with something awful like that, and then from there the discussion devolved into a series of increasingly terrible euphemisms that, as usual, continued through the end of the movie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Draco as the credits rolled. \u201cThat was certainly interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot what you expected?\u201d Harry asked. He still had his arm over Draco\u2019s shoulder and Draco\u2019s hand had returned to his knee.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI expected more watching and less\u2026 shouting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was nothing,\u201d Ron said with a laugh. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen us the night we got drunk and did dramatic readings from <i>Gadding with Ghouls</i>. There was so much shouting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed a little, and Harry smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could have a repeat performance. There are more books in the series,\u201d Ginny said. \u201cI\u2019ve got autographed copies of all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve <i>all</i> got autographed copies, Gin,\u201d Dean said, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot me,\u201d said Seamus. \u201cI chucked mine right in the bin as soon as class finished for the year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI set mine on fire,\u201d Draco said, nodding. \u201cIt was tremendously satisfying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTossed \u2018em into the lake,\u201d Neville said, then winced. \u201cThe Giant Squid threw them right back at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannah laughed and pinched him. \u201cHe did no such thing, you liar!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hand to Merlin, he did!\u201d Neville insisted, catching her hand before she could pinch him again. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say he could read and knew straight off what utter twaddle they were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could do another evening,\u201d Ron said. \u201cI could be convinced to skip movie night one Friday for it. But not next Friday because I pulled late shift.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only question,\u201d Seamus said, \u201cis do we read <i>Holidays with Hags</i> or <i>Voyages with Vampires</i> next?\u201d and beside him Dean pulled a face and muttered, \u201cThe man certainly liked his alliteration.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither,\u201d said Draco. He drained the last swallow of his butterbeer and set the empty bottle aside. \u201cWe read <i>Magical Me</i>. He goes on for an entire chapter about how he gets his hair so shiny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTook that chapter to heart, did you?\u201d Harry teased, and when Draco gave him a bland look, Harry swallowed and said, \u201cI mean. You\u2019ve got nice hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sniffed. \u201cEntirely a coincidence. I\u2019d never take fashion advice from a man whose favorite color is <i>lilac</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he does have his own line of hair-care potions,\u201d Hermione pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich he probably stole the formulas of,\u201d Harry pointed out, and Hermione conceded the point with a wave of her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIrrelevant,\u201d Draco said, then repeated, \u201cLilac.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got against lilac?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. \u201cI look ghastly in it. So did he, frankly. His complexion is much better suited to jewel tones.\u201d He stretched, shrugging off Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cAnyhow. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got an appointment tomorrow so I really should be off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, standing up a second after Draco did. \u201cAll right. Floo\u2019s just there, if you want.\u201d He gestured across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry walked Draco over to the Floo, quietly panicking about what to say. Normally he and Draco just shoved at each other and said they\u2019d see each other next time, but that didn\u2019t strike Harry as and especially couple-y way to say goodbye.</p>\n<p>\u201cI, erm. I didn\u2019t say thank you for the flowers earlier,\u201d Harry said quietly, because he hadn\u2019t and he probably should have. He could feel his friends watching him. \u201cSo, thank you. They\u2019re really quite nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Draco. He seemed a little surprised Harry had brought that up. \u201cWell. I\u2019m glad you like them.\u201d He glanced past Harry\u2019s shoulder to the rest of the room. \u201cThey\u2019re watching us, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed a little. \u201cI figured they would be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded to himself, head lowered, then looked up at Harry with a startlingly affectionate smile, and before Harry had time to process what was happening, Draco leaned in and kissed him once, very chastely. The warm press of lips lasted barely a second, and then Draco was pulling back and Harry caught himself swaying closer, chasing after it. He stopped himself before he thought the motion became too noticeable and took a hasty step back, rubbing a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Erm.\u201d He had the sinking feeling that he was blushing, and from the way Draco was watching him, fond and exasperated and amused, he guessed it was probably more noticeable than he\u2019d like that he\u2019d tried to prolong the kiss. The stretch of spine just between his shoulder blades itched with the weight of everyone watching, and he hoped it hadn\u2019t been as apparent from across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Draco said. He glanced past Harry again, and edged closer to the Floo. \u201cI\u2019ll see you for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Harry said, and watched as Draco scooped up a handful of Floo powder and vanished in a swirl of green flame.</p>\n<p>Harry took a moment to steel himself before he turned back to his friends, and found that with Draco gone they were no longer bothering to pretend not to watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he sighed, returning to his spot on the sofa and flopping down into it. His face still felt very warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Ron after a long stretch of silence. \u201cThat was certainly enlightening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Seamus added. \u201cFor a second there I thought you were actually\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry put his hands over his face and groaned loud enough to cut him off. He emphatically <i>did not want to hear</i> what Seamus assumed would happen next, especially not after all the terrible comments he\u2019d just finished making about poor saucy Doris.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, leave off him,\u201d Hannah scolded. \u201cHarry, you and Draco are very sweet together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s never a word I thought I\u2019d apply to Draco Malfoy,\u201d Neville added.</p>\n<p>Harry groaned louder and Ginny hit him with a pillow. He snagged it after it bounced off his face and nearly threw it back at her, but Luna had done her hair up in elaborate loops and curls and Charmed the paper labels from empty butterbeer bottles into strings of tiny paper flowers and woven them throughout and Harry didn\u2019t want to mess up all that hard work. He settled for making an ugly face at her, and she laughed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Neville said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised. I mean, I\u2019d heard you started dating him but\u2026 The two of you seem really good together. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry mumbled. \u201cI, erm. He\u2019s pretty great.\u201d He felt he should say more than that, but fuck it. He\u2019d never liked talking about his feelings. All the blushing and fumbling for words he was doing probably did more to convince his friends than anything else he could possibly say.</p>\n<p>He guessed it was a good sign that Hermione shot him a smug look, and Harry rolled his eyes in return. She was probably giving herself a mental pat on the back for setting him up so successfully.</p>\n<p>Well. He and Draco were going to break up in a little over a month. He\u2019d let her enjoy it for now, and afterward maybe he\u2019d get her to pick out someone new for him because honestly? Spending time with Draco was pretty great. Harry thought he might like to date someone like that for real.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>The following Friday, they went through it again with Draco\u2019s friends. Of course Draco had waited until Friday morning to spring it on him, so at least Harry only had the work day to worry about it instead of the whole week.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Potter,\u201d Draco said dryly when they met up at the end of the day. \u201cLast week went fine with your friends, and this will go fine with mine.\u201d He huffed a bit. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m fairly certain that Granger\u2019s putting in an appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p>That made Harry feel a little better, even though he fully acknowledged how ridiculous he was being. Draco\u2019s stiff and stilted behavior at the beginning of the evening when he\u2019d come to Grimmauld Place last Friday suddenly became a lot more understandable to Harry. Because sure, he knew all of the people who\u2019d be there tonight, but the thought of going out there and convincing them all he was happily dating Draco Malfoy made his nerves jangle alarmingly.</p>\n<p>But if Hermione would be there too, well. That\u2019d make two people who\u2019d help him out if he got into trouble, and Harry felt a little better for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I bring anything?\u201d Harry asked as he shrugged out of his heavy Auror robes and draped them carefully over the back of his chair, then put on his coat and began to button it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a pub,\u201d Draco said, rolling his eyes. \u201cWhat on earth do you feel you need to bring?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged, biting down on a smile as he said, very casually, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You felt it was necessary to bring bribes for my friends, I was just wondering if I ought to do the same for yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shoved him and Harry laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt worked rather well, didn\u2019t it? I\u2019m pretty sure after you break up with me, you\u2019ll be able to date Ron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shoved him again, harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy on earth do I put up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy pretty face?\u201d Harry suggested brightly. \u201cMy charming personality?\u201d He paused and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ve heard I\u2019m pretty fantastic in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good Merlin,\u201d Draco said and slammed out into the hall, which, hey. Wasn\u2019t a disagreement.</p>\n<p>Harry took his time locking up, then caught up to Draco by the lifts. \u201cSo who\u2019s all going to be there tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. \u201cPans, for sure. Blaise and Theo. Millie\u2019s bringing Anthony Goldstein, did you know they were dating now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t even know he was back. Wasn\u2019t he out of the country for a while?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmsterdam,\u201d Draco said, nodding. \u201cStudying advanced Arithmancy. Don\u2019t ask him about it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, is it boring?\u201d Harry asked. Arithmancy sounded boring, that\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t taken it in school.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, on the contrary; it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d Draco said. The lift arrived and they stepped inside, and Harry pressed the button to take them to the Atrium. \u201cHe\u2019s quite knowledgeable and some of the more esoteric theories regarding ancient numerology in\u2026 Never mind. You don\u2019t care. But he\u2019s got an agreement with Millie: no work conversations on pub night. She\u2019s got an internship at St Mungo\u2019s, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew she was doing something with Healing,\u201d Harry said. He\u2019d overheard her complaining to Hannah and Hermione one night about how dreadful she looked in lime green. Apparently she intended to start a petition for new uniforms and had gone to Hermione for pointers on organizing her campaign.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. She\u2019s studying infectious diseases, and she\u2019ll go on about it nearly as much as Goldstein and his Arithmancy. I find her course of study significantly less fascinating than I do his, but once one of them starts talking about work, all bets are off with the other.\u201d He rolled his eyes ceilingward. \u201cMerlin help me if I ever have to hear a single word more about\u2014No. I refuse to even speak the name aloud.\u201d He shuddered.</p>\n<p>And anything that could make Draco Malfoy shudder like that wasn\u2019t anything Harry wanted to know anything about in any amount of detail. He\u2019d once watched Draco quickly and efficiently disembowel a bat to get at its spleen in Potions class while simultaneously discussing about his plans for lunch out in Hogsmeade the following weekend. \u201cWell let\u2019s not talk about it, then,\u201d he said firmly, and changed the subject. \u201cWhere are we going tonight, anyhow?\u201d</p>\n<p>The lift arrived at the Atrium with a final lurch and the doors sprang open. \u201cThe Golden Snidget,\u201d Draco said as they stepped out.</p>\n<p>Fine by Harry. He rather liked that one, plus that was where Ginny always tried to get them to go when they went out so maybe he\u2019d run into her tonight, too.</p>\n<p>Together, they made their way across the Atrium and through a broad doorway at the end of the long row of fireplaces. Harry and Draco waited their turn through the short queue, then stepped into the red circle marked out on the floor and Apparated to Diagon Alley.</p>\n<p>From there it was just a short walk to the Golden Snidget, but the weather had taken a turn and Harry shivered. By the time it\u2019d occurred to him to do a Warming Charm, they\u2019d already arrived. Draco opened the door and held it politely while Harry ducked eagerly into the warmth of the pub, sighing with pleasure to be out of the cold. </p>\n<p>This early in the evening, business was still a little slow, and the pub was only half-full. Another hour or so and it\u2019d be packed nearly wall-to-wall and roaring with laughter and shouted conversation. Already, Harry felt a little bit of his worry melting away. This was a pub night just like any other. He\u2019d have a couple of pints, make a little bit of conversation, and it\u2019d be fine. Worst come to worst, Hermione would be here later on and he could talk to her.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s friends had taken over three tables in the back corner of the pub. Millicent and Anthony sat at one with Blaise and\u2026 was that Susan Bones? Harry\u2019d had no idea they were dating, either. Theo and Goyle sat at the second with Luna, and Harry relaxed a little more to see her here tonight. That meant Ginny would probably be along in a bit. Pansy sat at the third table all by herself.</p>\n<p>Harry and Draco stopped by the bar for drinks before they made their way over. There was a brief scuffle over who would pay, and Draco won with extremely poor grace, all smug and gloating like he\u2019d done something actually impressive rather than just getting his handful of Sickles to the bartender before Harry had. Harry gave him a glare and said, \u201cFine, but coffee\u2019s on me tomorrow,\u201d and Draco laughed and said, \u201cYeah, good luck with that,\u201d because he was a total arsehole who\u2019d made it some sort of personal mission to make things as difficult as possible on Harry. They weren\u2019t dating for real, and even if they were Harry would still expect to pay for his fair share of their dates.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019d deal with that when it happened. Harry took a deep breath and turned for the corner, and jumped when he felt Draco\u2019s hand touch the small of his back. Draco gave him a strange look and Harry shook his head, and Draco put his hand there again to gently guide him, and oh. Harry had managed to forget that this would be a thing. That in front of people they\u2019d have to act like a couple and acting like a couple meant touching. It wasn\u2019t that he minded the touching. Really, it was more the opposite. Draco touching him made Harry think of other times he\u2019d been touched by Draco, and how much he\u2019d enjoyed it at the time, and then his mind would fixate on how no one was touching him like that anymore, and from there it was just a short jump to thinking about how Draco had touched him quite a lot before, and then he couldn\u2019t help but notice how Draco was right here and then somehow he always got caught up in these thoroughly ridiculous fantasies of how Draco might do it again, and honestly it was pretty awful because Harry only ended up frustrated and lonely at the end of it.</p>\n<p>Well. It would only be for a few hours tonight. He\u2019d get through it.</p>\n<p>He did his best to ignore the way Draco\u2019s hand lingered at the small of his back as they greeted everyone. Harry drew out the small talk as long as he could, chatting with Blaise about his plans for Christmas and then with Luna about Ginny\u2019s latest game until, finally, he had no choice but to turn and greet\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Parkinson,\u201d Harry said, fingers tightening around his pint so that his fingerprints showed starkly white through the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Potter,\u201d Pansy said with a sharp smile. \u201cCome on over, I\u2019ve saved you a seat.\u201d She patted the chair beside her.</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco a helpless look, and Pansy cackled, actually bloody <i>cackled</i> like the witch she was. Draco gave Harry a shove forward, heedless of the way it made his ale slop over the rim of his glass and splash onto the floor. Harry glared at him but went and sat down before Draco could shove him a second time.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Pans,\u201d Draco said, leaning in to kiss her cheek before he took his own seat.</p>\n<p>She gave him a flat look. \u201cHi, Dray,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Draco pulled a face. \u201cUgh. Truce?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTruce,\u201d Pansy said. \u201cDraco.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy.\u201d</p>\n<p>They nodded to each other.</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t understand their friendship at all.</p>\n<p>He must have been giving Draco an odd look, because Draco slipped an arm over his shoulder and leaned in close to murmur in his ear, \u201cYou could try to look a little glad to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave Draco the soppiest smile he could manage and kissed his cheek as he reached beneath the table and pinched Draco\u2019s thigh. Hard. And he was immensely satisfied when Draco flinched and hung onto his own smile through what looked like sheer force of will.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Pansy said. She lifted her glass and took a sip, and her lipstick left a crescent-moon smudge of ruby-red on the rim. She looked from Draco to Harry and back again. \u201cAren\u2019t we just the picture of domestic bliss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to be living together to be domestic, wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d Draco pointed out.</p>\n<p>Pansy flapped a hand. \u201cDetails, darling. And quite frankly, I\u2019m certain it\u2019s only a matter of time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy,\u201d Draco said. \u201cKindly shut your fucking mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Pansy went on innocently. \u201cThis has been building up for quite a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has not and if you say another bloody word I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d Pansy said to Harry, talking smoothly over Draco, \u201cthat back at Hogwarts he used to talk about you all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Pansy</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were all so sick of hearing about it. It was always <i>Potter this</i> and <i>Potter that</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry, who\u2019d been drinking his pint and watching the exchange with some amusement, grinned and looked at Draco. \u201cDid you really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hated you back then,\u201d Draco said sullenly. \u201cYou were my most loathed arch-enemy. Of course I talked about you all the time because I was plotting ways to make your life miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snickered and slipped his arm around Draco\u2019s back, couldn\u2019t resist splaying his hand wide around the curve of Draco\u2019s ribs, warm and solid beneath his palm. \u201cI appreciate the effort,\u201d he said as seriously as he could manage.</p>\n<p>Draco glared at him and leaned back suddenly to catch Harry\u2019s arm painfully against the back of the chair. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Harry insisted, tugging his arm out from behind Draco and putting his hand on Draco\u2019s thigh instead. \u201cIt was a nice distraction from the madman bent on my destruction. I appreciated it very much. The badges were especially sweet. I still can\u2019t believe you charmed all of those yourself. Must\u2019ve taken you <i>hours</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took him <i>days</i>,\u201d Pansy corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d Harry cooed, and laughed when Draco shoved his hand off his thigh. \u201cSuch dedication, such patience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that was nothing compared to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Draco said, and oh, Harry definitely wanted to hear this because Draco sounded alarmed.</p>\n<p>Pansy didn\u2019t let him down. \u201cDo you remember the Dementor costume he talked poor Goyle into wearing with him in third year?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry said, clapping a hand over Draco\u2019s mouth when Draco tried to interrupt again.</p>\n<p>Draco bit him. Harry stuck his finger up Draco\u2019s nose in retaliation.</p>\n<p>Pansy blinked. \u201cI feel like I just got an uncomfortably close look at what sex between the two of you must be like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt most certainly\u2014\u201d Draco began, and Harry stuck his fingers into Draco\u2019s mouth, and for an instant he seriously thought Draco was going to punch him. Frankly, Harry just counted himself lucky Draco hadn\u2019t bitten him a second time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe costume, Parkinson!\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy\u2014\u201d Draco tried again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe sewed it himself!\u201d Pansy crowed.</p>\n<p>Harry looked at Draco. \u201cDid you really?\u201d he asked, delighted at the wonderful mental image with which his mind was now supplying him: tiny little Draco sitting in the Slytherin common room, laboring over an enormous pile of black fabric with a needle and thread. His brow had probably furrowed in concentration the same way it did in Potions class when he chopped ingredients.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Pansy went on, and Draco evidently resigned himself to the fact that he couldn\u2019t stop this from happening and slouched down in his seat. \u201cOnly he had no idea how to sew. So he begged a first year girl to give him lessons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>bribed</i> a first year girl into giving me some amount of instruction. I wrote her Potions essay for her,\u201d Draco muttered. \u201cShe got an O on it, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed and kissed the side of Draco\u2019s head, ignoring the way his stomach flipped at the feel of warm smooth skin beneath his lips. \u201cI\u2019d have expected nothing less than perfection from your bribery-cheating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo right,\u201d Draco said sullenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it probably helped that you were a writing an assignment for a student two years below you,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even I could have got an O on that. Ow, ow, hey!\u201d he yelped and pushed at Draco when Draco reached over and mashed his knuckles hard against Harry\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, Potter?\u201d Pansy said from safely across the table. \u201cI think I quite like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry grinned at her, rubbing his leg a little. \u201cThe feeling\u2019s mutual, Parkinson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d said Draco, glancing back and forth between the two of them, \u201cis the worst day of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheer up, darling,\u201d Pansy said, smirking at him a little. \u201cOh, and be a dear and fetch me another drink?\u201d She waggled her empty tumbler at him, ice cubes clinking sharply against the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Draco said, taking her glass and standing. \u201cBut only because it\u2019s an excuse to get away from you for a few minutes, you awful cow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry drained the last third of his pint in several long gulps, then held the glass out. \u201cAnother pint for me as well, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Draco clenched his jaw. \u201cOf course, sweetheart. Anything for you,\u201d he ground out, snatched Harry\u2019s empty pint glass from his hand, and stalked off across the bar.</p>\n<p>Pansy watched him walk away, making no attempt to hide the fact that she was leering at his arse. Harry couldn\u2019t find it in himself to blame her; it was a <i>very</i> nice arse. He only realized that he was ogling it too when he caught her smirking at him. Harry just shrugged, because what the hell, he had an excuse to ogle all he liked for the next while, he might as well take advantage of it. Pansy\u2019s smirk grew.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, drawing out the word. \u201cI\u2019m certainly glad to see that my matchmaking has paid off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeddling,\u201d Harry corrected, taking another peek over his shoulder at Draco and was glad he did. Draco was leaning forward on the bar and it made his back arch just-so. Harry\u2019d fucked him in that very position more times than he could count. It was one of his favorites.</p>\n<p>\u201cMatchmaking,\u201d Pansy insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s only called <i>meddling</i> if it turns out poorly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s the chance it might. We\u2019ve only been together for about a month.\u201d And, oh. It really had been a month. A little longer than, actually. For a moment, Harry couldn\u2019t believe that his time with Draco was half-over. Just five weeks left.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Pansy said. \u201cI see the way you two look at each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t look at him like anything,\u201d Harry protested, because he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Pansy gave him a flat look. \u201cPlease. You look at him like you\u2019re ready to tear his clothes off right here and now.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that lined up pretty well with what Harry had been thinking, so maybe he did look at Draco like that? Oh god, <i>did he</i> look at Draco like that? Why hadn\u2019t Draco said anything about it? Had Draco noticed? Maybe he hadn\u2019t noticed and that\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry managed, wishing very much that he still had a pint because he\u2019d love a distraction right about now. \u201cHe\u2019s got a nice arse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy snorted. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll let you off with that.\u201d She shrugged one shoulder. \u201cBut only because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave her a weak smile and resisted the urge to look over his shoulder again. Where the bloody hell was Draco? Talking to Pansy had been so much easier when he could gang up with her and make fun of him. Plus, Draco got all flustered and irritated, and that was always a nice bonus.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Pansy said, and the sincere intensity of her tone had Harry looking up at her in surprise. \u201cIf you tell this to Draco, I\u2019ll deny everything. But I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve given him a chance. Draco\u2019s my best friend, and I want to see him happy. You do that, you know. He\u2019s happy with you in a way I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Harry blinked a little, processing. He guessed he and Draco must be doing a good job pretending. He hadn\u2019t thought they were presenting themselves as a terribly convincing couple, what with all the bickering and Harry sticking his fingers in most of the orifices on Draco\u2019s face, but apparently they were doing something right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like him,\u201d Harry said, a little surprised by his own honesty. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I would, but I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy nodded. \u201cGood, very good.\u201d She looked off to the side and smiled, and Harry looked over to see Draco approach their table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere you go, you horrid woman,\u201d he said, setting down a tumbler in front of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pansy said as Draco handed Harry a fresh pint, and waited until he took a sip before she continued, \u201cPotter here was just expounding upon the virtues of your arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry choked on his pint.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Potter,\u201d Draco said loftily. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. It\u2019s a very nice arse, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry continued to choke, and Draco went on,</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m well aware of your feelings toward it so I\u2019ve no idea why you\u2019re being so dramatic right now.\u201d He lifted his eyebrows significantly, and that didn\u2019t help Harry any because now Harry was thinking of all the time he\u2019d spent getting well-acquainted with Draco\u2019s backside and how much he\u2019d enjoyed it and, yeah, maybe he should quit drinking now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not being dramatic,\u201d Harry said, coughing a little. \u201cAnd, really? You're calling me dramatic? Isn\u2019t that a bit pot and kettle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco raised his eyebrows. Harry stared him down. Across the table from them, Pansy propped her chin up on her hands and settled into her chair, evidently enjoying the show.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d said Hermione, dropping into the last empty chair at the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look on your face. What\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d Pansy said. \u201cPotter and Draco bickering like a couple of overgrown children, Potter waxing rhapsodic over Draco\u2019s arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Hermione said, nodding. \u201cThe usual, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not <i>wax rhapsodic</i>!\u201d Harry protested. \u201cAnd Pansy was the one who brought up Draco\u2019s arse in the first place. And I don\u2019t talk about his arse, anyhow!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you. It\u2019s a very nice arse,\u201d Hermione said, not even bothering to hide her smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Draco dryly. \u201cLet\u2019s all discuss my arse a little louder. I\u2019m not certain the bartender could hear about it from all the way over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your type, darling,\u201d Pansy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019d care whether she knows about your arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry craned his neck a bit to see over the crowd and get a glimpse of the girl behind the bar. \u201cGinger?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a flat look. \u201cFemale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, blinking. He was personally attracted to people regardless of gender, and sort of went along on the assumption that everyone else was bisexual unless they explicitly told him otherwise. \u201cSo, you\u2019re\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly interested in men,\u201d Draco said. \u201cVery much only interested in men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good Merlin,\u201d Pansy said. \u201cHas this really not come up yet? Draco\u2019s as gay as a maypole. I flash a little cleavage and he practically swoons like the heroine of a trashy Victorian-themed romance novel seeing her first throbbing manhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrobbing member,\u201d Hermione corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s always member in those sorts of books. Not always throbbing, though. Sometimes turgid. Sometimes rigid. Once I saw <i>unyielding</i>, which frankly just sounds uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like the sound of manhood better,\u201d Pansy said, taking an inelegant slurp of her drink. \u201cSounds all\u2026\u201d She clenched her fist and gestured with it. \u201c<i>Powerful</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut member\u2019s classy,\u201d Harry put in. \u201cThough I personally like <i>velvet-wrapped steel</i>. Not very accurate, if you ask me, but it sounds nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for the love of\u2014\u201d Draco cut himself off and flung his hands up in the air. \u201cHow on earth do you even know that?\u201d He sounded scandalized, and Harry rolled his eyes. Hermione read romances; Harry\u2019d borrowed a couple here and there. He wasn\u2019t ashamed. In fact, he\u2019d rather enjoyed that series of vampire-themed ones.</p>\n<p>Pansy gave Draco a long, speculative look. \u201cHow on earth do you manage to have a shag with that attitude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell generally there\u2019s quite a bit less talking,\u201d Harry put in.</p>\n<p>Draco slanted him a glare. \u201cReally? Because I distinctly remember rather a lot of talking when you\u2014\u201d He broke off with a sudden horrified look, and Harry, who had a pretty good idea of which occasion exactly Draco was referring to, felt himself blush hotly.</p>\n<p>Hermione had to cover her face with her hands, she was laughing so hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026\u201d Draco belatedly said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo dramatic,\u201d Pansy commented. \u201cThe look on your face, good Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell not all of us prefer to advertise our bedroom business outside the bedroom,\u201d Draco said primly, struggling to regain some measure of decorum, and frankly Harry was impressed Draco could say that with a straight face, given just how often their <i>bedroom business</i> had taken place in various semi-public locales.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, you go to pieces whenever someone so much as mentions sex. You are ridiculously dramatic about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not go to pieces!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione had to put her head down on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get <i>the vapors</i>,\u201d Pansy continued with vicious glee. \u201cI practically have to break out the <i>smelling salts</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have <i>never in my life</i>\u2014You horrible woman, I am <i>not</i> dramatic!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy you a fainting couch for Christmas,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cHermione, would you like to go in on it with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re joking,\u201d Hermione said, putting her head back up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d said Pansy. \u201cI\u2019ve got just the thing in mind, too. Tufted velvet, royal blue with mahogany trim, Queen Anne\u2019s legs. He\u2019ll look downright ravishing when he lolls on it like the swooning damsel he is at heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you buy me a fainting couch, so help me I will set it on fire,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Pansy told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll compromise. I\u2019ll buy you a chaise longue. You can use it for swooning <i>and</i> sitting.\u201d She slid a sly glance at Harry, smirking. \u201cAmong other things, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled. \u201cWhy am I friends with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, actually. Force of habit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mercifully, Pansy seemed to decide that she\u2019d tormented Draco enough for one evening and turned to Hermione, and the pair of them were quickly sucked deep into a conversation about Ministry politics, which Harry had less than zero interest in, but listened to idly for a bit for lack of anything better to talk about since Draco was still sulking. Then Ginny came in and, after greeting Luna, pulled up a chair and squeezed in beside Harry and they talked about Quidditch. Draco eventually joined in on their conversation, and partway through he draped his hand over the back of Harry\u2019s chair and leaned in close, and Harry couldn\u2019t help leaning against him a little and the rest of the evening from there on out was quite enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Eventually Ginny wandered off, and Hermione and Pansy excused themselves to the toilet, and by then it was quite late.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make my escape while Pans is otherwise occupied,\u201d Draco said, standing, and Harry stood with him. \u201cOr else she\u2019ll insist on accompanying me home, and then she'll get into Father\u2019s collection of fine scotches and then I\u2019ll have to hear about it the next morning.\u201d Draco rolled his eyes a little at that.</p>\n<p>Harry lingered by his side as Draco went to his other friends and made his goodbyes for the evening, a small bubble of excitement swelling larger and more insistent the longer it went on. Finally, Draco finished up and turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Potter. I\u2019ll owl tomorrow?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, unable to look away from Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he was tipping his chin up just that slightest fraction so that when Draco leaned in, their lips met perfectly. Blaise wolf-whistled, the arsehole, and Greg clapped loudly. Draco flipped them both off without looking away from Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d he said again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d Harry echoed as Draco stepped back and turned for the door.</p>\n<p>Harry watched Draco walk away, and it felt like the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done in his life to keep from chasing after him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said softly to himself as the implications fully sunk in. Because before when it\u2019d just been sex, he\u2019d watched Draco\u2019s arse as he\u2019d walked away. This time, he\u2019d been watching <i>Draco</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Hermione said from beside him, and Harry had been so preoccupied with his thoughts that he hadn\u2019t noticed her approach.</p>\n<p>He sighed. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that was exactly the problem.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Harry was tempted to pour out everything to Hermione. He\u2019d always been attracted to Draco, he had no problem admitting that. And it made sense to him that being around Draco would rekindle some of that attraction. He\u2019d acknowledged that from the beginning. Accepted it. Had even gone so far as to embrace it a little, flirting a bit with Draco and bringing up their recent past because, honestly, he liked making Draco acknowledge what they\u2019d done, even if they weren\u2019t doing it anymore.</p>\n<p>But this? This was new. This was new and extremely problematic. Because even when they\u2019d been fucking, Harry hadn\u2019t actually <i>liked</i> Draco. Which wasn\u2019t to say that he\u2019d <i>disliked</i> him, because he certainly hadn\u2019t done that. He just hadn\u2019t much cared one way or the other. They\u2019d never really taken the time to talk to each other, and Harry\u2019d been perfectly fine with that. He hadn\u2019t wanted anything more than what they had.</p>\n<p>It\u2019d been fine.</p>\n<p>And now? This was very much no longer fine.</p>\n<p>Cool fingers pressed to his wrist and Harry startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Hermione asked, looking up at him in concern.</p>\n<p>He forced a smile. \u201cSorry, lost in thought. And, you know, nothing good ever comes from that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes, her exasperation mostly put-on. \u201cHow much have you had to drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>More than he should have had, because he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Draco. \u201cNot that much, but I still probably shouldn\u2019t be Apparating.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help glancing up toward the door, but Draco had already gone out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to call it a night, then?\u201d Hermione asked, offering her arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, linking his arm through hers and letting her take him home.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything all right with you and Draco?\u201d Ron asked Harry one sunny Saturday morning at the beginning of December.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said distractedly, turning over the bacon he had sizzling in a pan. The grease popped and spat, stinging his thumb. Harry stuck it into his mouth to suck it clean and finished flipping the bacon. \u201cWhy?\u201d He wiped his hand against the thigh of his jeans.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ron said, and seemed to be working up to something. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you never seem to be alone with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re alone all the time,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m meeting him at that little coffee place on Diagon in about an hour, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s in <i>public</i>,\u201d Ron said. \u201cNot exactly the sort of alone most couples want to be\u2026\u201d He raised his eyebrows significantly.</p>\n<p>Even then, it took Harry a few seconds to work out what exactly Ron was implying. \u201cOh! Oh, you mean <i>alone</i>, alone. Well, erm. We\u2026 are taking that part of the relationship slow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ron said, nodding. \u201cOkay. Well, I just wanted to make sure you knew we wouldn\u2019t mind if you wanted to bring him round more often, or spend the night or what have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know some of us haven\u2019t got the best history with Malfoy, but you know everyone\u2019s put the past behind them,\u201d Ron went on. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to think you\u2019d be making anyone uncomfortable by having him over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHermione and Pansy are BFFs now. I didn\u2019t think that anyone\u2019d have anything against Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ron said. \u201cAnd no one would be surprised by it, or anything. You and Malfoy have been giving each other looks when the other isn\u2019t watching for a while now. We all figured it was only a matter of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said again, and felt his cheeks going warm. He sort of wanted to ask how long \u2018a while\u2019 was, but was also sort of afraid to know the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI just wanted to be sure. I mean,\u201d He paused and looked away. \u201cI was just concerned. Taking it slow is fine, but when you were with Gin you were always\u2026\u201d He flapped a hand vaguely, coughed once, and said, \u201cAlone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, fidgeting with the spatula in his hands. He knew Ron meant well, but this was a conversation he wanted to stop having as quickly as possible. \u201cThanks. I appreciate your concern. But, you know, every couple moves at their own pace, and. We\u2019ll, you know. Get there when we get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mercifully, Ron let it drop and Harry returned his attention to the bacon until a few minutes later when Hermione came down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Harry\u2014\u201d she began in that falsely-cheerful tone that meant she was about to bull her way through an incredibly awkward conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already took care of it, Hermione,\u201d Ron cut her off loudly, and oh god, they\u2019d been discussing this behind his back.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Harry loved living with his friends; sometimes Harry couldn\u2019t wait for them to all move the fuck out of his house. Ron gave him a sympathetic grimace, and Harry sighed and crammed a slice of bacon into his mouth. Hermione opened her mouth to keep going, and Ron shook his head, and then the two of them proceeded to have a complicated conversation that consisted entirely of raised eyebrows and significant staring. Harry ignored them and turned back to his pan.</p>\n<p>Ron helped out by making the toast, and Hermione made them all tea, and by the time Harry finished up with the scrambled eggs, Seamus and Dean had joined them in the kitchen as well. Harry glanced at the doorway, wondering what was keeping Luna and Ginny, and right on cue, Luna swept into the room, barefoot even though the tile floor of the kitchen was always chilly this time of year. She had her long hair pulled back into a neat plait, and cheerful red flowers woven through it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019ve made breakfast,\u201d she said as she got down a plate and began to heap a large serving of scrambled eggs onto it. \u201cGinny\u2019s not feeling well this morning, I think getting something in her stomach will help her feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron snickered. \u201cI told her that last Fizzing Fireball was a bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFizzing Fireballs are <i>always</i> a bad idea,\u201d Seamus moaned, laying his head down on the table. Beside him, Dean rubbed his back sympathetically while looking highly put-upon. He\u2019d been Designated Disapparator last night, and Seamus always drank more on nights he knew Dean would take care of him the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d asked Harry innocently to Ron, ignoring Seamus. \u201cAnd here I was, blaming the half a dozen Screwdrivers she\u2019d had before that. Silly me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seamus moaned again. \u201cStop talking about alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this time, Luna had loaded up the plate with generous portions of everything. She paused by Harry and tucked a loose curl of hair behind her ear. \u201cAre you going to see Draco later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>She reached farther back and plucked loose a flower and offered it to him. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to surprise our loved ones with little things. You should take this to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, erm\u2026\u201d Harry hesitated, then reached out and took the flower. Why not? Draco had brought him flowers, turnabout was only fair play, wasn\u2019t it? \u201cThanks, Luna.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luna nodded to him and left the kitchen, and Harry cast a few preservation and protection charms on the flower before he tucked it into his pocket. Hermione was looking smug again, and Harry gave her ponytail a sharp tug as he passed by her to take his seat at the table.</p>\n<p>After a leisurely breakfast, Harry still had some time to kill before he was to meet up with Draco, so he thought he\u2019d take care of some of the chores he\u2019d been neglecting during the week. But when he went to gather up his dirty laundry, he found it all clean and folded and very pointedly left in a basket at the foot of his bed. Harry scowled at it. Looked like Kreacher had scored another point in their ongoing War of Housework. He\u2019d probably done it while Harry was busy with breakfast, the sneaky little shit. Still scowling, Harry gathered up stacks of tee-shirts and neatly bundled pairs of socks and stuffed them away in the drawers of his bureau, taking what small comfort he could from the fact that in order to make his point, Kreacher hadn\u2019t been able to put anything away.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019re onto us,\u201d Harry told Draco later that afternoon when he joined him at their usual corner table in the coffee shop.</p>\n<p>Draco blinked at him. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you done, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Harry protested. \u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re never alone together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike they\u2019d even notice if we were,\u201d Draco said, rolling his eyes. \u201cWe spent an awful lot of time <i>alone together</i> during training and none of them realized.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell now they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Harry pointed out, stealing Draco\u2019s cup and taking a sip. \u201cRon asked me if something was wrong with the relationship. And I told him we were taking things slow, but we\u2019ve been together for a month now, I\u2019m not sure how much longer that excuse\u2019ll hold up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco made a small sound of irritation and stole his cup back. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll spend a few nights together here and there. I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re so concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that. Well. We\u2019ve never spent the night together before.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Draco gave him was pure disbelief. \u201cAre you hearing yourself right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve been told you snore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Draco, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s why you\u2019re concerned. Well don\u2019t worry, Potter. Your virtue\u2019s perfectly safe with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, only because you\u2019ve already taken it over a year ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been doing an excellent job of keeping it safe ever since, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Draco said, taking a sip of his latte. He licked a smudge of foam from his upper lip as he set his cup back on the table.</p>\n<p>Harry had to wrench his gaze away from Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco huffed and rolled his eyes again. \u201cRelax, Potter. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess it will,\u201d Harry said, eyeing the cup and wondering whether he could get away with stealing another sip before Draco forced him to go order his own.</p>\n<p>Then Draco leaned into his space, his knee nudging up against Harry\u2019s, and Harry moved away from him, then stood up so it looked like he hadn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to order. Do you, er, want anything else?\u201d he asked, shoving his hands into his pockets and coming across the flower as Draco shook his head no. \u201cOh, hey. This is for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He held it out, and Draco stared at him like he\u2019d lost his mind entirely, and Harry sort of wished he hadn\u2019t taken Luna\u2019s advice because while it had all seemed quite practical in his kitchen earlier this morning, here and now it just felt awkward. Then Draco reached out and took the flower, his fingertips warm from touching his cup as they brushed against Harry\u2019s. Harry shoved his hand back into his pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Draco said uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Harry told him, and fled to the counter for some much-needed distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain I already know the answer to this,\u201d Draco said a few minutes later when Harry returned to the table with a latte carefully balanced in his hands, \u201cbut being the fool that I am, I\u2019m going to ask you anyhow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry set his cup gently down on the table. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you aware what an aster means when presented to someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced at the flower in Draco\u2019s hands. \u201cHonestly? Until you just said it, I didn\u2019t even know it was an aster.\u201d He\u2019d just seen it and thought, flower.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Draco nodded a bit to himself and looked down at the aster.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 what\u2019s it mean?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cIf you asked me if I knew, I\u2019m assuming you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. \u201cPatience, mostly. And good luck, and love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those were sort of nice, and Harry guessed two of the three could apply. Patience because this whole charade was still ongoing, and a little good luck never hurt anyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the ones you gave me?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cDid those mean something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled at him. \u201cOf course they did. Gladiolus is the flower of August birthdays\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I was born in July,\u201d Harry said, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a <i>Leo</i>, which means <i>gladiolus</i>,\u201d Draco went on, talking over him, and then huffed, \u201cThey represent strength of character,\u201d which would\u2019ve been quite a nice compliment if he hadn\u2019t grumbled it like an insult.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u201d Draco said, looking away, and when he looked back his brows furrowed together and he was frowning. \u201cWhy? Did you want it to mean something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut, <i>strength of character</i> isn\u2019t all that romantic, is it? And if we\u2019re supposed to be dating\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means I respect you, Potter. Frankly I can\u2019t think of much else that\u2019s more romantic than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thought that over. \u201cI guess so,\u201d he said eventually.</p>\n<p>The conversation moved along to other topics, and then Draco said he was meeting Pansy for dinner and had to be off, and Harry looked up and found to his surprise that twilight had already fallen.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, yeah, I promised Ron I\u2019d take care of the shopping on my way home,\u201d Harry said, standing.</p>\n<p>They walked out together, and Draco knocked his shoulder into Harry\u2019s before they parted ways, Draco heading up Diagon to wherever he\u2019d agreed to meet up with Pansy and Harry around the side of the coffee shop to a quiet place from which to Apparate.</p>\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t until later that evening that Harry stopped to really think about it, and got what Draco had been trying to say. Harry had never thought of respect as particularly romantic. People certainly never brought it up when they talked about romance. But respect in a relationship was sort of like the foundation of a house, wasn\u2019t it? No one really thought to talk about it so long as it was there and working properly.</p>\n<p>Draco thought Harry was a strong person. He respected Harry, and treated him as an equal and, come to think of it, that was probably a large part of the reason they\u2019d got on so well in bed. They\u2019d approached each other as equals, and for all that they bickered they also respected each other deep down, and everything had sort of fallen into place from there.</p>\n<p>Harry paused with one arm through the sleeve of his pajamas, then shrugged and shoved his other arm in and pulled the shirt over his head, and filed this away as something to think about later when he was looking for a real partner.</p>\n<p>And the tiny part of him that pointed out that Draco was everything Harry wanted to look for?</p>\n<p>Well. Harry did his best to ignore it, because Draco might right here beside him, but he was so far out of Harry\u2019s reach that it might as well be miles.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>Draco never pushed Harry about spending the night together, and the following week Harry finally blurted out, \u201cCome home with me tonight?\u201d for no other reason than he was desperate to no longer have it hanging over his head like some sort of sword of bloody Damocles.</p>\n<p>It was all a bit anticlimactic, though, when all that happened after was Draco shrugging and saying, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Conveniently, some of their friends had planned another pub night that Saturday, and Harry and Draco went, and drank, and Draco kept putting his arm around Harry\u2019s waist or his hand on Harry\u2019s knee, and each time it happened Harry quietly died a little bit inside and tried his hardest not to show it, and drank more in an effort to distract himself.</p>\n<p>At the end of the evening, Ron Side-Alonged them back to Grimmauld Place one at a time, and Draco pulled a satchel from his pocket and unshrunk it with a tap of his wand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, er, right,\u201d Harry said as it dawned on him that Draco, despite having spent quite a lot of time in his room, had no idea how to find it in the house. He\u2019d always Apparated straight in and out until Dean and Seamus had taken over Regulus\u2019 old room and Seamus had an awful habit of treating the upper floor like a shared dorm room. Harry had stopped expecting to have any measure of privacy within the first week, but that was okay because he sometimes left his door cracked open to hear Seamus snoring across the hall. He slept better that way.</p>\n<p>But now he\u2019d made very, very sure that Dean and Seamus were aware he\u2019d be having a guest tonight. Not that he\u2019d be caught doing anything embarrassing with Draco, but Harry didn\u2019t much fancy dealing with the fallout of Seamus startling Draco, because Draco had the unfortunate habit of throwing hexes when someone caught him by surprise.</p>\n<p>Personally, Harry thought Draco was just a vicious little shit looking for excuses to hex other people because he\u2019d gone through Auror training, hadn\u2019t he? Harry had witnessed another trainee detonate a Blasting Curse about six inches from Draco\u2019s left ear during training and Draco hadn\u2019t even flinched, just turned slowly and deliberately and then hexed the everloving snot out of the trainee who\u2019d done it. Harry was hard-pressed to think of another witch or wizard who had anywhere near the same level of impeccable control as Draco had.</p>\n<p>Harry led the way up the stairs, keeping firm hold of the banister because he was drunk enough that he\u2019d gone a bit unsteady on his feet. The second floor, shared by Ron and Hermione, was dark and quiet, but the third floor was dimly lit by warm lamplight spilling from the nearly-closed door of Ginny and Luna\u2019s bedroom. Music played softly, high tinkling notes and crooning vocals that didn\u2019t form any words Harry could decipher, so Luna was home. The uppermost floor was also dark\u2014Dean and Seamus were planning to stay out a little longer\u2014and Harry switched on the lights with a wave of his wand and pushed open the door to his bedroom.</p>\n<p>Draco followed him inside and closed the door after himself, then took off his shoes and left them sitting neatly beside Harry\u2019s. He dropped his satchel on the chair and opened it, pulling out pajamas and a small toiletry bag, and a warm sort of fondness fluttered in the bottom of Harry\u2019s chest at how Draco didn\u2019t bother to look around, and his easy familiarity in Harry\u2019s private space.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute,\u201d Draco said, tucking his things under his arm and going back out into the hall.</p>\n<p>A moment later, Harry heard the door to the bathroom click shut. Hurrying, he stripped off his clothes and tossed them in the general direction of the basket, then pulled on his pajamas, and could go no further until Draco came out of the bathroom. Harry plopped down onto the edge of the bed and awkwardly listened to the sound of the sink turning on and off, then on, then off again. He heard Draco pee, and the toilet flush. The pipes clanked softly, muffled in the walls, and then the door clicked open again and Draco returned.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone?\u201d Harry asked, already standing up even as Draco said yes. Draco looked softer, somehow, in his blue and grey plaid pajamas, his hair slightly mussed from pulling his shirt over his head, his feet bare against the dark wood floor. He looked more approachable like this, and Harry wanted so badly to touch him.</p>\n<p>Instead, Harry turned and fled the room.</p>\n<p>In the bathroom, Harry used the toilet and then took his time brushing his teeth and washing his face and avoided looking in the mirror, because he always looked strange in the mirror when he was drunk and it unnerved him a little. The pipes had quieted by the time he slipped back into the bedroom, and oh, it was a good thing he\u2019d taken the extra time to collect himself in the bathroom because he was entirely unprepared for the sight of Draco tucked into Harry\u2019s bed, his hair glowing gold in the light of the bedside lamp, the covers drawn up demurely to his chest as he lay propped up on several large, fluffy pillows that Harry was sure Draco had brought with him. He had a book open in front of him and a pair of gold wire-framed reading glasses perched on the end of his nose. It was a strangely domestic image, and for an instant Harry <i>wanted</i> so badly for this to be his life that he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u201cClose the door, Potter, you\u2019re letting in a draft,\u201d he snapped without looking away from the page.</p>\n<p>Harry turned quickly and shut the door, took a deep breath, and approached the bed. Draco kept his eyes on the book, and that made it easy for Harry to lift the covers and slip underneath them, and oh. Draco had done a Warming Charm on the bedsheets and Harry sighed with pleasure, going a little boneless as the warmth soaked into his skin in just the faintest tingle of magic. He fidgeted a little to get his socks peeled off, and sighed again as he rubbed his cold toes against the mattress.</p>\n<p>\u201cWarm bedding when it\u2019s cold is one of life\u2019s greatest pleasures,\u201d Draco said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve been denying yourself all these years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d sighed Harry, warm and still a little drunk and so, so comfortable. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d His eyes had grown heavy and fallen shut of their own accord.</p>\n<p>Beside him, Draco snorted but didn\u2019t comment. Harry heard a page turn, the edge of the page swishing crisply over the sheet. He turned onto his side, putting his back to Draco and the glow of the lamp, and burrowed deeper into the blankets until he was tucked in up to his nose.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been worried this might be awkward, lying in bed with the bloke he wasn\u2019t allowed to fuck anymore. That he\u2019d lie awake listening to Draco breathe and go quietly mad from suppressing the urge to close the space between them, to feel the warmth of Draco\u2019s body against his own.</p>\n<p>But this was nice, this wasn\u2019t awkward at all, and that was Harry\u2019s last thought before he dropped easily into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>The following morning, however, more than made up for it.</p>\n<p>Harry came awake slowly, lingering in that warm and hazy place that comes on the tail-end of a rapidly fading dream, where his brain had only just been accepting all manner of fantastical and absurd things, and so accepted waking up with Draco\u2019s body intimately tangled with his own as totally normal. Draco had his arm flung over Harry and his face tucked into the crook of Harry\u2019s neck, his breath coming in warm huffs against his collar. And it made sense to tighten his arms around Draco, cuddle him a little closer, and press a warm kiss to the top of his head.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s hair tickled his nose, and then Draco mumbled sleepily into Harry\u2019s neck and wriggled closer, flinging one leg over Harry\u2019s and, oh. That was Draco\u2019s cock. That was Draco\u2019s very hard cock pressed right up against Harry\u2019s hip, and Harry\u2019s cock throbbed in response. And Harry had just kissed him, and now they were\u2014</p>\n<p>Before he could panic any further, Draco grumbled something unintelligible and turned his face into Harry\u2019s chest and mouthed at the hollow at the base of his throat and rocked his hips, grinding against Harry.</p>\n<p>He should wake Draco up, but if he woke Draco up then Draco would be embarrassed and things would be awkward, but if he let it go on longer then it would be worse, wouldn\u2019t it? And also Harry really really liked what was happening.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco,\u201d Harry said, taking Draco by the shoulder and pushing at him. \u201cDraco wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco responded by biting Harry\u2019s collarbone. \u201cM\u2019awake, you arse,\u201d he grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2026\u201d Harry trailed off as Draco tugged on him, pulling him onto his side so they were facing each other. Their hips lined up for a moment and Harry shivered as the hard ridge of Draco\u2019s erection dragged over his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Draco sighed, tangling his fingers in Harry\u2019s hair and tugging him into place.</p>\n<p>Harry obligingly kissed his way up the side of his neck until he reached the hinge of Draco\u2019s jaw. He sucked at the little indent right below his ear and listened to Draco gasp, felt him shudder with pleasure against Harry. He breathed deep, the warm smell of skin and soap, laced with a faded edge of worn-off cologne, and a sudden burst of longing detonated in the depths of Harry\u2019s chest. He sucked again before kissing at Draco\u2019s jaw, then ducked his head and nosed at Draco\u2019s cheek to get him to put his head up for a proper kiss. Draco murmured something that might\u2019ve been Harry\u2019s name and then their lips met, Draco\u2019s mouth so soft and pliant, fitting perfectly against Harry\u2019s for a moment before it fell open. Harry licked into Draco\u2019s mouth and got about two seconds of warmth and sleep-sour breath and the slick side of Draco\u2019s tongue against his own, and then Draco jerked back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Draco panted, shoved one hand under his pillow and groped around. He came up with his wand and jabbed Harry in the face with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, what the fuck,\u201d Harry gasped as the spell burst on his tongue, leaving all the soft tissues of his mouth tingling sharply in an almost overwhelming rush of spearmint.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Draco said before doing the same spell on himself and jamming his wand back under his pillow. \u201cNow I can kiss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d Harry started.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I do,\u201d Draco said, then kissed him hard, and Harry found kissing him back to be a much better use of his time than arguing.</p>\n<p>Because <i>Draco</i> was <i>kissing him</i> and Harry was sure that nothing in his entire life had ever felt this good, kissing Draco Malfoy while still warm and a little muzzy from sleep and oh god, Harry could\u2019ve had a whole year of this, even though it wouldn\u2019t have meant to him then what it did now. Draco\u2019s mouth against his own was insistent and possessive as they kissed, and alarm bells began to ring in the back of Harry\u2019s mind. This was such a bad idea. This was a tremendously bad idea. They shouldn\u2019t be doing this, they\u2019d agreed at the beginning of their fake relationship that sex wouldn\u2019t be part of it. And it felt disingenuous, somehow, to be kissing Draco now that Harry had feelings for him, because Draco didn\u2019t know that. As far as Draco knew, this was just kissing. And if they had sex, he\u2019d think that it\u2019d just be sex when to Harry, it was so much more. And he couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>Harry broke the kiss, and turned his head away when Draco tried to recapture his mouth. \u201cMalfoy, hey,\u201d he said, and broke off in a soft grunt as Draco bit at his throat and then sucked hard. God, that almost certainly left a mark. \u201cHey,\u201d he said again. \u201cWait, I thought you, I thought we\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop thinking about it,\u201d Draco said, and kissed him again.</p>\n<p>He slid one hand down Harry\u2019s stomach and pressed his palm firmly over the hard ridge of Harry\u2019s cock and gave it a little squeeze, and Harry\u2019s brain promptly shorted out. He wriggled around enough to get his pajama bottoms tugged down enough because he wanted Draco\u2019s hand on his cock without a layer of flannel in between them, and Draco kindly obliged him by helping. Harry couldn\u2019t hold back a groan as Draco\u2019s fingers closed around him and stroked.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike that, do you,\u201d Draco murmured against his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry breathed, and let himself get lost in it for another few tugs before he pushed at Draco\u2019s pajama bottoms and got them down his thighs.</p>\n<p>Getting his hand on Draco\u2019s cock again felt like coming home, the hard length nearly as familiar in his hand as his own, hot and a little damp against his palm. Draco whimpered when Harry took his hand away and broke the kiss just long enough to lick his hand. He took Draco\u2019s cock in his fist again and rubbed his thumb over the head before giving it a little squeeze. </p>\n<p>Draco exhaled shakily and his mouth went slack against Harry\u2019s as he lost focus. Harry kept working him relentlessly in long, firm strokes, and barely a minute later Draco\u2019s hand stuttered and stalled against Harry\u2019s cock. And that was fine, Harry didn\u2019t mind at all. Less distraction as he watched Draco. He\u2019d squeezed his eyes shut tight, his brows drawn together, lips pink and wet from kissing and slightly parted as he let loose these wonderfully needy little gasps. Every so often he\u2019d remember himself and give Harry\u2019s cock a stroke or two, and Harry would sigh and kiss the corner of Draco\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take much longer for Draco to reach his climax. His breathing hitched and he pressed closer to Harry, and then he was coming, hips jerking, cock throbbing as he spilled slick and warm over Harry\u2019s fist.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Draco sighed, mouthing drowsily at the tender underside of Harry\u2019s chin, \u201care <i>entirely</i> too good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I do try,\u201d Harry said. He began to withdraw his hand from beneath the covers, already pushing himself up on his elbow and looking around for something to wipe himself clean with.</p>\n<p>Draco stopped him, taking his hand in his own and wiping as much of his come off onto his own fingers as he was able. Harry assumed Draco was trying to clean him up, but then Draco pushed his dirty hand back down under the blankets and gave Harry a wicked smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry groaned as Draco\u2019s slippery hand closed around his cock. \u201cYou filthy bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d Draco murmured against his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Harry agreed. He\u2019d have agreed to anything at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Draco hummed, and gave his neck a sharp bite. \u201cOn your back, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry obediently rolled onto his back, and Draco shuffled around under the blankets until he was kneeling between Harry\u2019s thighs. He took his hand off Harry\u2019s cock and Harry let out an embarrassing whine at the loss.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, I\u2019ll get back to it,\u201d Draco said, using his other hand to yank at Harry\u2019s pajamas.</p>\n<p>Harry helped him out, kicking free of them as Draco pulled, and then Draco scooted closer between Harry\u2019s legs and went right back to stroking his cock. The sides of his thighs pressed against the sides of Harry\u2019s arse, his flannel pajamas impossibly soft. Draco leaned down and pressed a kiss to Harry\u2019s stomach and pushed one of his legs up.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a hand?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Harry obediently hooked his hand behind his knees and pulled them up, spreading himself open, stomach jumping because he knew what was coming next. Sure enough, Draco sucked a finger into his mouth, cheeks hollowing as he sucked, getting it nice and wet. Harry exhaled a shaky breath and watched as Draco drew the finger back out with a wet pop and reached down between Harry\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p>The first touch of Draco\u2019s finger made Harry\u2019s hips jerk, and he breathed deep and even as Draco pushed inside, slow and steady. It burned, being forced open like this even with a single finger. Harry hadn\u2019t had anything inside him since the last time Draco had touched him like this. He liked it well enough, but it didn\u2019t really do much for him when he did it to himself, so he never bothered.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want another?\u201d Draco asked, crooking his finger and rubbing over Harry\u2019s prostate.</p>\n<p>Harry had to take another breath and force his brain to focus before he could answer. \u201cNo, this is good. I\u2019m\u2026 god, this is really good, just like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco curled his finger and brushed a kiss against the side of Harry\u2019s knee. \u201cLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s laugh came out as more of a breathless huff. \u201cNot gonna last long enough for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then,\u201d Draco said and kissed Harry\u2019s knee again. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Harry did. He stopped thinking and lost himself in the feel of Draco\u2019s hand on his cock, Draco\u2019s finger stroking inside him, the warm press of Draco\u2019s knees on either side of his hips. Harry rolled his head to the side, and the tip of his nose brushed against the cool pillowcase of Draco\u2019s pillow, and it smelled like him. He felt himself begin to go tight, his balls drawing up, his body clenching around Draco, and all of a sudden his release was looming ahead of him, eager and inevitable all at once.</p>\n<p>The way it was building, Harry expected his orgasm to be a violent, explosive sort of thing, an overwhelming rush of pleasure that blasted through him like a bolt of lightning. Instead, it built and built, higher and tighter, but then instead of a sudden drop, it felt more like a gentle nudge over the edge, a small sweet step from <i>nearly there</i> to <i>oh god yes</i>.</p>\n<p>Harry curled in on himself as it washed over him, his fingers tightening around the backs of his knees, and Draco stroked him through it as he came in long pulses over his own stomach. Draco let him go as Harry sagged back against the bed, his legs slipping out of his grasp and flopping open around Draco. Everything felt slow and warm, and Harry couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt this wonderful as Draco clambered half-over him to get at his wand, and leaned in to steal a quick kiss before he set about cleaning them both up.</p>\n<p>The chilly tingle of Cleaning Charms sweeping over his skin yanked Harry abruptly back to reality. Because, oh god, he\u2019d just had sex with Draco. Avoiding Draco\u2019s eyes, Harry shuffled back and sat up, untangled himself from the rumpled bedsheets and slipped off the bed. He snatched up his pajama bottoms and yanked them back on as quickly as he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d Draco asked. He sounded unsure, like he thought Harry might be upset with him. It unsettled Harry even more than he already was, because Draco Malfoy never sounded unsure about anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis can\u2019t happen again,\u201d Harry said. His chest hurt. His stomach felt like it\u2019d tied itself in a knot. The warm afterglow of his orgasm had vanished entirely, leaving a sick ache in its place, the last remaining haze of sweet lassitude souring to lethargy. He shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Draco softly, his voice barely loud enough to carry over the rustle of sheets as he sat up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you wanted\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Harry said quickly, because he very much had wanted it. \u201cBut when we started this, you said you didn\u2019t want sex to be part of it. I should have respected that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turned to go, and then stumbled forward as a pillow slammed into the back of his head. He spun round, just in time for Draco to swing at him a second time and catch him square across the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s for being an idiot,\u201d Draco spat. \u201cAs if you could make me do a single bloody thing I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wrenched the pillow from Draco\u2019s hand and hit him so hard with it he knocked him sideways, and yeah, it was much more satisfying from this end. Draco caught himself with a hand against the mattress, and Harry tossed the pillow onto the other side of the bed before Draco could steal it back. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re an idiot too, then. We\u2019re both idiots, happy? It was nobody\u2019s fault, and it won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Harry said and turned away, grabbed his jeans from last night off the floor and a clean pair of pants and jumper from his dresser. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>With the bathroom door between him and the rest of the world, Harry let out a long, juddering sigh and slumped against the counter. His reflection in the mirror showed him pink-cheeked with his hair even more of a wreck than usual. Draco had left a livid lovebite on his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d said Harry, rolling his eyes at himself.</p>\n<p>He thumped his bundle of clothing down on the vanity and turned away to start the shower, and by the time he finished stripping down, the water had warmed up enough for him to step in. At least, he thought to himself dourly as he reached for the soap, that wistful wish he\u2019d made all those months ago when they\u2019d called it quits had come true: Harry\u2019d got to have one last time with Draco in a proper bed.</p>\n<p>And then he did his best to put Draco entirely from his mind as he washed, taking his time to soap all the bits he tended to skip, scrubbing behind his ears and between his toes, and washing his hair twice. When he couldn\u2019t linger any longer (and frankly he was a little afraid of what Ginny might do to him if he used up all the hot water again) he got out and toweled himself roughly dry before he brushed his teeth and washed his face and got dressed.</p>\n<p>Unable to put it off any longer, Harry tapped the mirror with his wand to unfog it and set about Healing his lovebite. And after a couple of tries at trying to fix it, Harry finally admitted that he was pants at Healing Spells and ventured back into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cErm, do you think you could\u2026?\u201d he asked, gesturing at his neck. He could feel himself blushing again.</p>\n<p>Draco came closer and gently tipped Harry\u2019s chin back to get a better look at it. \u201cI certainly got you good,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to leave it? I mean, if you wanted to convince your friends that we\u2019re.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth the teasing I\u2019d have to put up with.</p>\n<p>Draco smiled a little at that, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said, then tapped his wand against Harry\u2019s throat and murmured a spell. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, brushing his thumb against the spot where the lovebite had been. \u201cAll gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry took a step back and Draco\u2019s hand fell away. \u201cThanks.\u201d Then, because he had to know, \u201cHey, Malfoy. Are we all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco frowned at him. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry said, scuffing his socked foot along the seam between two of the floorboards. \u201cI just wanted to make sure what happened this morning wouldn\u2019t make things weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Draco asked. He flicked Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019ve done to each other, you\u2019re afraid a couple of handjobs will make things awkward?\u201d</p>\n<p>He had a point, and Harry felt a bit silly for even bringing it up. But he\u2019d had to be sure he hadn\u2019t messed up his\u2026 well, he felt strange calling it a friendship. But keeping Draco in his life however he could felt important to him, and if what\u2019d happened this morning had messed that up in any way, Harry wanted to start repairing the damage as soon as he could. They only had a few more weeks where they were forced to be around each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right,\u201d Draco sniffed, then smiled at him and added, \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you\u2019ve mastered agreeing with me so readily.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave a weak laugh. \u201cBest fake-boyfriend ever,\u201d he offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou certainly are,\u201d Draco said. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like a shower too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Due to waking up later than usual, and then his shenanigans with Draco followed up by a long shower, Harry reached the kitchen much later than he normally did. He wasn\u2019t even halfway down the stairs to the basement when the warm smells of baking told him that Kreacher\u2019d got one up on him today. On the one hand, Harry hated to lose. On the other, Kreacher had made crepes and despite himself, Harry loved Kreacher\u2019s crepes. Ginny and Ron and Hermione were already down there, Hermione working diligently at the daily crossword while Ron and Ginny bickered over god-knew-what.</p>\n<p>\u201cSaved you some strawberry, mate,\u201d Ron said, nudging a plate set on the table beside him. \u201cGinny tried to eat it but I fended her off. Made her eat the ones with chocolate and banana instead, her life is <i>so hard</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a true friend,\u201d Harry said, pouring himself some tea as Ginny kicked Ron beneath the table. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason me and Gin didn\u2019t work out, you know. At Hogwarts she always used to steal the bacon off my plate.\u201d He sighed, heavy and put-upon. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t face that for the rest of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny threw a chunk of banana at him, and it bounced off his glasses and plopped neatly into the fluffy dollop of whipped cream on top of his crepes. It left a chocolatey smudge on his glasses and Hermione cleaned it with a murmured <i>Scourgify!</i> from across the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso,\u201d Harry went on quickly when Ginny cocked back her arm with another banana chunk in hand and gave him a threatening look, \u201cGinny is far too good for me, and more radiant than a thousand suns, with lips like rose petals and very nice hair that does that pretty wavy-flippy thing at the end when it\u2019s short, and, erm, eyes that\u2026 don\u2019t need glasses because they\u2019re not shit like mine, and\u2014hey, Gin! Stop, I was saying nice things about you!\u201d The second piece of banana bounced off Harry\u2019s chin and rolled away under the cabinet.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd being an arse about it!\u201d Ginny said, throwing another piece, but Ron snatched it out of the air and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, you\u2019re like children,\u201d Draco said, coming down into the kitchen, and Harry\u2019s heart skipped a beat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell clearly I\u2019ve got a type,\u201d Harry said, and Draco rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome sit by me,\u201d Hermione said, not looking up from her crossword. \u201cI\u2019m behaving like an adult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad to hear that at least one of you is,\u201d Draco said with a pointed look at where Ginny was trying to steal a strawberry off Ron\u2019s plate and Ron was doing his best to fend her off with a fork without actually stabbing her with it.</p>\n<p>Harry focused on his breakfast for a slow count of five, then very casually let himself look at Draco as Draco stood at the counter to serve himself crepes and tea. He wore robes today, his hair still a little damp from his shower, neatly parted on the left and swept to the side. His feet were bare and very pale against the dark tile floor. Harry looked away as Draco finished serving himself and rounded the table to sit by Hermione. Harry glanced up at him out of habit as he approached, because they always exchanged chaste kisses in front of any audience, and then froze when he realized what he was waiting for. But Draco only hesitated an instant before giving him a kiss as he passed by.</p>\n<p>After all they\u2019d done earlier this morning, a barely-there brush of lips shouldn\u2019t have been enough to make Harry blush, but there it was. He looked down at his plate as his throat went tight, pleasure and yearning twisting together into something prickly and uncomfortable that settled like a stone in the bottom of his lungs. Draco sitting at the other end of the table, leaning a little into Hermione\u2019s space to look at her crossword, felt so far away he might as well have been across an ocean. Harry had grown used to Draco sitting beside him, his knee nudging up against Harry\u2019s, his hand on Harry\u2019s leg or his arm over Harry\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>He sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Ron asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry looked up and tried to arrange his face into some sort of expression that didn\u2019t scream <i>pining and half-in-love</i>. He wasn\u2019t sure he was successful, but he shrugged. \u201cJust tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Ginny said, smirking at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t get much sleep last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry froze and his eyes darted to Draco. Draco just glanced up from the paper and smirked at him, then reached out and tapped part of the crossword grid.</p>\n<p>\u201cThirteen down\u2019s \u2018eye of newt,\u2019\u201d he offered, and Hermione gave him a tremendously annoyed look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t got there yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged and sipped his tea. \u201cAnd twenty-six across is \u2018parsnips,\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlaying with fire there, mate,\u201d Ron advised. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason she\u2019s sitting over there and we\u2019re all down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ginny swatted at him. \u201cShut up,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see her try to stab him with her biro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo stabbing in my kitchen, please,\u201d Harry said, taking a sip of his tea. \u201cKreacher will be unbearable if he has to clean that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen perhaps you ought to tell your boyfriend to quit spoiling my crossword,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlagging,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThirty-two across.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione slammed her pen down. \u201cI have punched you before and so help me I\u2019ll punch you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco mimed locking his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Ginny called from safely down the table. \u201cShe\u2019s only mad about that one because she didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe never knows the Quidditch ones,\u201d Ron added.</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. Apparently everyone had a death wish today.</p>\n<p>But Hermione only grumbled to herself, \u201cI\u2019ll hex the lot of you,\u201d and picked up her pen again.</p>\n<p>Draco slid his plate down the table and then scooted down the bench until he was sitting beside Harry, close enough that their elbows brushed. Harry leaned briefly against him, and Draco gave him a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is horrifying how cute the two of you are,\u201d Ginny said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say,\u201d Harry shrugged and looped his arm around Draco\u2019s neck, reeling him in to smack a kiss against the side of his head.</p>\n<p>Draco shoved him off, and Harry grinned at him. Draco rolled his eyes and returned his attention to his breakfast.</p>\n<p>This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, Harry thought. It\u2019d be nice if this were his life. He watched Draco for a moment longer, until he felt his smile start to slip. And then he looked away.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to figure out our plan for a break up,\u201d Harry said as he and Draco climbed into bed together. Draco had taken to staying the night on Fridays and Saturdays, which was partially to keep up their charade of a relationship, and partially because they spent the whole weekend together anyway and this was just convenient.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Draco said, leaning over to turn on his bedside lamp as Harry extinguished the main lights. He picked up his book and his glasses but didn\u2019t put them on yet. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s coming up quite soon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said. Honestly, he was feeling a little torn about it. On the one hand, he wouldn\u2019t get to spend nearly as much time with Draco and they certainly wouldn\u2019t be sharing a bed anymore. On the other hand, he would no longer be spending so much time with Draco, nor would he be sharing a bed with him, and if those things stopped happening, it\u2019d probably do good things for his emotional well-being. This awful yearning and unrequited-whatever couldn\u2019t be healthy for him long-term. Mostly it just ached constantly and Harry wanted it to stop.</p>\n<p>Because this whole attracted-to-Draco thing was starting to get seriously out of hand. Harry was starting to lose whole stretches of time to fantasizing about their fake relationship becoming real. How maybe he\u2019d get hurt on a raid and Draco would rush to his bedside at St Mungo\u2019s and hold Harry\u2019s hand and confess his undying love and then Harry would make a miraculous recovery and the pair of them would live happily ever after. Or when they staged their break-up, neither of them would be able to go through with it, and they\u2019d look at each other with shining eyes and they\u2019d <i>know</i> it was real. Or Draco would be taken hostage on a mission, and Harry would go in after him, and together they\u2019d fight their way to freedom, and then Draco would be so overcome by Harry\u2019s daring and impressed by his wandskills that he\u2019d fall into Harry\u2019s arms and\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry sighed and dismissed that particular fantasy. Draco Malfoy had never been impressed by a single thing Harry had ever done, and probably never would be. Harry couldn\u2019t even bring himself to fantasize about it, because honestly he sort of loved that about Draco. Best stick to the one where he got injured and Draco came to him at St Mungo\u2019s. That one had a better chance of actually coming true.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d Draco asked, jabbing him sharply in the arm with the corner of his book.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, stop,\u201d Harry scolded, because that\u2019d actually hurt. He swatted at Draco and Draco hit him with the book again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude to start a conversation and then trail off in the middle of it,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Well it\u2019s also rude to <i>hit people with books</i> but I don\u2019t see that stopping you,\u201d Harry muttered.</p>\n<p>Draco hit him with the book again. \u201cI\u2019m keeping you focused.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being an arse,\u201d Harry said, making a grab for the book. He only got his fingers whapped for his troubles.</p>\n<p>Harry scowled at him and Draco rolled his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cWorst fake-boyfriend ever,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to see the back of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave him a leer. \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Potter. You\u2019ve always enjoyed seeing my backside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, that was horrible.\u201d Harry could feel his cheeks warming. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut true,\u201d Draco said smugly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay. I like looking at your arse, happy?\u201d Harry said as sarcastically as he could manage. Flirting had grown more and more difficult lately. It still gave him a bit of a thrill, but sometimes when he said things like this, he\u2019d begun to hear an edge of naked longing behind his words. He was so afraid of Draco being able to hear it too.</p>\n<p>\u201cDelighted.\u201d Draco set his book aside and dropped his glasses on top of it, and Harry breathed a little easier. He liked Draco in glasses more than he probably should. \u201cNow. You wanted to discuss our impending break up?\u201d</p>\n<p>No, Harry very much did not want to discuss it. But Harry needed to. \u201cYeah. When we\u2019d talked about it before, we\u2019d figured a reason to split up would work itself out along the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Draco said, nodding. \u201cAnd one hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was right on the tip of Harry\u2019s tongue to suggest, <i>Then maybe we shouldn\u2019t, maybe we could stay together and give it a real try</i>. But he couldn\u2019t make himself say that out loud. \u201cYeah, exactly. So we\u2019re going to need to make one up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was quiet for a long moment, his long fingers picking at a snag in the duvet, and Harry had to look away. His body shivered with the sense-memory of having those fingers on him and in him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold?\u201d Draco asked, and before Harry could reply he\u2019d taken his wand from beneath his pillow and cast another Warming Charm.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Harry groaned as a fresh wave of warmth swept over him, seeping into his skin. He could feel his body going lax. \u201cShouldn\u2019t\u2019ve done that if you wanted a proper conversation out of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen go to sleep,\u201d Draco said, reaching for his book and his glasses again. \u201cWe\u2019ll work out the rest of it in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Harry mumbled. He snagged his glasses off his face and tossed them on his bedside table, then turned over on his side and curled up.</p>\n<p>He heard the sheets rustle as Draco got comfortable, then the warm weight of his hand on Harry\u2019s head, fingers carding gently through his hair for a moment. Harry couldn\u2019t help pushing into the touch, and Draco snorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a dog,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>But his voice was warm and affectionate, and his fingers were rubbing over that spot just behind Harry\u2019s ear that felt so good, so Harry let it go. \u201cSay whatever you want about me so long as you keep doing that,\u201d he mumbled, turning his face into his pillow to give Draco better access to his hair.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s hand left, and then Harry heard a page turn, and then Draco\u2019s hand came back and kept rubbing. Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>He probably shouldn\u2019t let this happen. But what the hell, it felt good, and it wasn\u2019t hurting anyone except himself. He\u2019d enjoy it tonight, take these few minutes before he fell asleep to pretend that this was something he could have. And tomorrow, they\u2019d figure out how to bring it all to an end.</p>\n<p>- - - - -</p>\n<p>When Harry awoke the next morning, it was one of those strange mornings where it felt like no time had passed between closing his eyes and opening them again, the whole night shrinking down until it was small enough to fit into the space of a single blink. At some point, he and Draco had moved together again. One of Harry\u2019s feet was tucked snugly between Draco\u2019s calves, and Draco had flung an arm over Harry\u2019s chest and pushed his nose into the space between Harry\u2019s shoulder and the bed. Harry\u2019s fingers were curled around the hem of Draco\u2019s shirt.</p>\n<p>Harry lay still, kept his breathing deep and even, listened to Draco make the most ridiculous little snuffling breaths against his shoulder. He\u2019d lied about the snoring, as far as Harry could tell, but there was the snuffling and sometimes he hummed a little on each exhale, and Harry sort of loved it. He\u2019d never ever admit this to Draco, but he thought it was pretty cute.</p>\n<p>He breathed in, held it for a few seconds, and let it out slow. There were a lot of things he loved about Draco, and he worried about how soon all of those things might add up until he was just in love with Draco himself. The thought of being in love alone terrified him.</p>\n<p>It was for the best that this charade would soon be over. Honestly, Harry had no idea why he\u2019d gone along with it in the first place. Looking back, the whole thing felt like the flimsiest excuse ever for him getting to spend time with Draco. Faking a relationship so his friends would stop setting him up with people? All Harry would have had to do was tell them firmly that he wanted to take a break from dating. They\u2019d have poked a little fun at him for it, sure, but they would have backed right off. Maybe a part of him had known even back then that he\u2019d felt something more for Draco than he was admitting to himself. Maybe the little seed of affection had been there all along, and just hadn\u2019t been able to sprout until Harry had come to know Draco\u2019s mind as well as his body.</p>\n<p>Harry looked down at Draco sleeping against him. He\u2019d miss this. He could admit that to himself. He\u2019d definitely miss this.</p>\n<p>Sighing a little, Harry carefully brushed a lock of Draco\u2019s hair aside and then ghosted the lightest kiss against the top of his head. Two weeks was both too much and too little time left.</p>\n<p>Moving slow and careful, Harry disentangled himself from Draco and slid out of bed. Draco mumbled something to himself and rolled into the warm spot Harry had just vacated and shoved his face into Harry\u2019s pillow with a contented little hum. Harry smiled at him, his heart warm and panging, then tiptoed across the room to gather up his clothes for the day. He scooped yesterday\u2019s trousers off the floor and draped them over his arm, then picked up the jumper he\u2019d worn the day before and tossed it on top of his bureau so Draco wouldn\u2019t bitch at him for it. Ridiculous, in Harry\u2019s opinion, since this was Harry\u2019s room in Harry\u2019s house and Draco wasn\u2019t even his for-real boyfriend, but sometimes it was far easier to go along with things than to deal with the fallout. He took a clean shirt and pants and a fresh jumper from his drawers, then slipped out of his room, closing the door gently behind him.</p>\n<p>Draco still wasn\u2019t up by the time Harry had finished showering, so he went downstairs to the kitchen to start breakfast. This was his favorite time of day, early enough that the daylight still felt fresh and new. He liked the way it slanted in through the ground-level windows of the kitchen and splashed across the tiles, and everything was quiet and calm. It reminded him a little of early mornings at the Dursley\u2019s, when he slipped into the kitchen to start breakfast while the rest of the family was still getting dressed and ready. Except when the rest of the household came down for breakfast now, they\u2019d greet him with smiles, sometimes hugs or the occasional kiss (usually from Ron, surprisingly enough, the only straight man in the house, but he always got really excited on the mornings when Harry made flapjacks) and then breakfast was a loud affair that reminded Harry of mornings at Hogwarts, like he\u2019d taken a little piece of what\u2019d made the castle feel like home and brought it with him to Grimmauld Place.</p>\n<p>Plus, he seeing people enjoy the food he\u2019d made gave him a deep and steady sense of pleasure. One of these days he really ought to learn to cook more than just breakfast.</p>\n<p>Harry descended the stairs and stepped into the kitchen just in time to see Kreacher taking pans out of the cupboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it from here, thanks, Kreacher,\u201d Harry said, plucking the heavy cast iron pan from Kreacher\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Kreacher stepped back, looked at the pan, looked at Harry, and said, \u201cIf Master Harry does not want Kreacher to make breakfast, then Kreacher will busy himself with Master Harry\u2019s laundry. He has not done it in two weeks and must be nearly out of socks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, no\u2014!\u201d Harry started, but it was too late; Kreacher had already vanished with a sharp crack. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said. Well. Harry hoped Draco was already awake. And, truthfully, Harry really was almost out of socks.</p>\n<p>He sighed and chalked this one up as a draw and let it go. He had enough on his mind this morning without competing with Kreacher over daily chores. Like working out what to make for breakfast. And also how to bring his fake relationship to a very real end.</p>\n<p>Well, that could just be Draco\u2019s problem. This had all been his stupid idea to begin with. Let him figure out how to get them out of it. Harry lit the flame beneath the pan a little too aggressively and fire licked up over the sides of the pan. Sighing, he closed his eyes and tried to force himself calm, adjusted the heat and then got out bacon and started the first batch cooking before he got out the ingredients for flapjacks. At least someone would be kissing him this morning.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d just finished getting all the ingredients mixed together and about half the bacon cooked when the stairs creaked, and Harry glanced over his shoulder expecting to see Ron or Hermione. Instead, Draco came shuffling in, dressed but with his hair still sleep-rumpled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my jumper,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware, thanks,\u201d Draco mumbled, heading straight for the kettle.</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him, and when Draco didn\u2019t seem inclined to elaborate, prodded, \u201cYou\u2019re wearing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged. \u201cSmells like you,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSmells like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Draco said, bumping his hip against Harry, crowding him out of the way until he could open the drawer and get a teaspoon. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco banged the drawer shut. \u201cIs there an echo in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d Harry said, glancing around to see whether someone else had come downstairs without Harry noticing. They were alone down in the kitchen, no one else within earshot. Harry could understand Draco having taken Harry\u2019s jumper for the sake of appearances, but the explanation didn\u2019t make sense without an audience to fool. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that supposed to be novel information?\u201d Draco asked as he filled up the kettle and lit the burner beneath it with a flick of his wand, then turned to the cabinet to get a mug. \u201cDo you want tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stuck his wand in his back pocket and stretched up to get down two mugs. \u201cWhat am I saying, of course you\u2019ll want tea. You\u2019re useless before your first cuppa. Though I suppose I can\u2019t say too much about it since I am as well. Kettle, cauldron and all that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Malfoy</i>,\u201d Harry said sharply, because, no, they were going to talk about this. \u201cYou just told me you\u2019re wearing my jumper because you like how it smells. I\u2019m not letting this go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned and leaned back against the counter. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, looking resentful as hell, and why would he be looking so resentful unless he didn\u2019t want to talk about this, and the only reason Harry could think of for Draco to not want to talk about this was if he had something he felt he wanted to hide. And there was only one thing, as impossible as it seemed, that Harry thought Draco would want to hide in this circumstance.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d Harry asked. His heart was pounding. Did Draco want him for real? Had he got himself just as swept up in this as Harry had?</p>\n<p>But of course Draco had never made anything easy for Harry, and why would he start now. Instead of answering, he looked away and jerked one shoulder in half a shrug.</p>\n<p>Harry watched him for a long moment, but Draco continued to stare stubbornly at the kettle. And as the seconds ticked past, it became apparent that if Harry wanted this conversation to go anywhere useful, he\u2019d have to start it off himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I think I\u2019d like it if you meant it, erm, like that,\u201d he said softly.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s head snapped around to look at him, his eyes widening. But he still didn\u2019t stay anything.</p>\n<p>Gathering his nerve, Harry took a step closer to him. \u201cBecause you wearing my jumper because you like how it smells, well, that\u2019s an awfully boyfriend-y thing to do. And I,\u201d He paused, swallowed. \u201cI think I\u2019d like it if you meant it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I did mean it like that,\u201d Draco said after a moment. \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Encouraged, Harry closed the distance between them, reached out and slipped his hands beneath the hem of the jumper, settling his palms against Draco\u2019s hips. Harry moved slowly, and Draco didn\u2019t make any move to stop him. \u201cWell. I\u2019d probably tell you that I like seeing you in my jumper. That I\u2026\u201d He took a breath. \u201cThat I like looking at you and seeing that you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Draco said, turning a little pink. \u201cThat seems like the sort of thing that would appeal to your caveman brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, you like my caveman brain,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged and still wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI suppose I do.\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cI suppose I might like other bits of you as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat bits of me?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cAnd if you say my cock, I\u2019m going to hit you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to say your cock, because you\u2019ve just said it for me,\u201d Draco said. He turned to the cabinets and got down the box of tea. \u201cI like this bit of you.\u201d He waved one hand up and down at Harry.</p>\n<p>Harry looked down at himself but couldn\u2019t see anything obvious that Draco might\u2019ve been indicating. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat,\u201d Draco said, flapping his hand again. Then grudgingly elaborated, \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him for a long moment, during which Draco steadily turned pinker until he was blushing from the tips of his ears all the way down to his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Harry said finally. \u201cAre you always going to be this bloody difficult? I mean, is this what I can expect from you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged and looked away, chin set mulishly. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. He turned back to the stove and transferred the cooked bacon from the pan to the plate, then laid new strips in to start sizzling. That\u2019d give him a few minutes. \u201cCome here, you arsehole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Draco muttered, but came over and let Harry push him up against the counter beside the stove.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d said Harry, leaning in so close that the tip of his nose brushed against Draco\u2019s. \u201cThis works out really great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Draco breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry echoed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t come up with any reason we\u2019d break up. Now I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re counting the last two months as our relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slid his hands around Draco\u2019s waist and then down, tucking his fingers neatly into Draco\u2019s back pockets and using his grasp to tug him close until their hips lined up. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThose were the best dates I\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Draco said, and finally, <i>finally</i>, closed the last inch between them and kissed Harry.</p>\n<p>The bacon in the pan ended up burning, but Draco\u2019s wand was in his back pocket with Harry\u2019s hand, so he used it to Vanish the mess and the smoke and turn off the flame. He tucked the wand back into Draco\u2019s pocket, followed it up with his hand so he could give Draco\u2019s arse a squeeze, and then devoted his full attention to thoroughly reacquainting himself with Draco\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>The stairs creaked but Harry couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to stop kissing Draco. The footsteps paused in the doorway, and then Harry heard a distinctly Hermione-ish huff from behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh thank god,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry flipped her off without looking, and then her words belatedly sunk in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, reluctantly taking a step away from Draco. \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s about time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione and Draco exchanged a look, then Hermione shook her head and shrugged at him and turned away to make herself a mug of tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, did you\u2014Malfoy. Did she know?\u201d Harry demanded, and Draco shot a plaintive look at Hermione who cackled and vanished up the stairs. Actually cackled. She really needed to stop spending so much time with Pansy. Speaking of\u2026 \u201cShe knew, didn\u2019t she? And Pansy knew. You told Pansy?\u201d Draco had made him sit through a whole pub night with Pansy Parkinson and pretend to be his boyfriend when all the while Pansy knew?</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s guilty look intensified. \u201cI\u2026 might\u2019ve\u2026 possibly\u2026\u201d He mumbled something too low for Harry to catch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you, all right?\u201d he huffed, folding his arms over his chest and looking away. \u201cAnd I thought it would stop after our arrangement came to an end, and then I might\u2019ve made the mistake of mentioning it to that shrieking harpy I call a best friend, and then\u2026\u201d He waved vaguely between himself and Harry. \u201cThe opportunity presented itself, so I took it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It said something significant to Harry that he\u2019d learned how to read between the lines well enough to follow the ridiculous leaps of logic that Draco\u2019s mind made.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLet me get this straight. You figured out you missed me and wanted to have a relationship with me, so you got Pansy to get Hermione to set us up, then suggested to me we carry on a fake relationship which involved real dates, so that you could try to make me fall in love with you for real somewhere along the line of pretending to have feelings for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged, still not looking at him. \u201cBasically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wrong before. When I said that it was stupid we were going on dates to get to know each other to convincingly pretend to have a relationship? That wasn\u2019t stupid at all. Because <i>this</i> is stupidest thing I have ever heard in my entire life, and I\u2019ll remind you that I sat through an entire year of Defense with Lockhart. Draco, why the fuck didn\u2019t you just ask me out on a date yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco huffed again. \u201cYou said it yourself on our first date. We fucked for a whole year and you didn\u2019t seem interested in anything beyond that. I just thought, maybe, if sex was off the table and I gave you the chance to get to know me better\u2026\u201d He sighed and his shoulders slumped a little. \u201cI thought maybe something would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, yeah, that was true. During training, he\u2019d been so exhausted that sex was about all he\u2019d been able to handle, and it hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind that he might like to get to know Draco outside the bedroom. He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I have it on good authority that I\u2019m one as well, so that makes us perfect for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sounded so resentful that Harry couldn\u2019t help but laugh, and then laugh harder when Draco\u2019s scowl darkened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d he said. \u201cC\u2019mere, you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco finally looked back at him, and Harry caught his mouth in a kiss, lost himself in it for a few long seconds before something more important occurred to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Harry said, running his hands up and down Draco\u2019s back in long, slow strokes. \u201cNow that we\u2019re for-real dating, can we have sex again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes and leaned in to steal another kiss. \u201cFigures that\u2019s where your dirty mind would go. Honestly, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harry protested. \u201cI got used to spending a certain amount of time in bed with a rather fantastic bloke. And since we called it off I\u2019ve had sex once. So, yeah, that\u2019s where my mind went.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2026\u201d Draco frowned. \u201cI\u2019m the once?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were there for it, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just assumed\u2026\u201d Draco trailed off, his frown deepening. \u201cI heard about all the dates you went on. I assumed at least one of them would have, well. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThere\u2019s only been you.\u201d</p>\n<p>A slow smirk curled at the corners of Draco\u2019s mouth. \u201cWell. I have to admit that I rather like the fact that I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s had you like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you dared give me shit about my caveman brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee? Just another way we\u2019re perfect for each other. Now, what say you we make up for lost time, hm?\u201d He slid his hand down to cup Harry\u2019s half-hard cock through his trousers and gave it a little grope.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Harry said, dancing away and batting at Draco\u2019s hands. \u201cStop that, I\u2019ve already got breakfast going and if I don\u2019t finish it, I\u2019ll have a riot on my hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a house-elf, haven\u2019t you? Let him finish it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd give him the satisfaction?\u201d Harry said, looking around to make sure that Kreacher wasn\u2019t within earshot. \u201cNever. I\u2019m ahead this month, anyhow, and I\u2019d like to keep my lead. We can wait a little bit. We\u2019ll finish up breakfast and spend the rest of the day in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Draco said. \u201cBut only because you\u2019ve made bacon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco mostly got in the way and he kept stealing pieces of bacon and kept trying to distract Harry with kisses while he was trying to work, but he also made Harry a cup of tea so he supposed it worked out all right. Plus, he really did enjoy the kissing. Hermione came back down and settled at the end of the table with her crossword, and Harry served her up a plate as soon as he finished cooking, and Draco made up two more and brought them over to the table, and he and Harry sat down.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d barely started eating when Ron came in.</p>\n<p>\u201cFlapjacks!\u201d he said reverentially. He made a slight detour to where Harry was sitting to give him a big smacking kiss against the side of his head. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snickered. \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to steal my man, Weasley?\u201d Draco drawled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Ron said with his mouth full. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to put the first one onto his plate before taking a bite. \u201cHe leaves his socks on the floor. Drives me batty.\u201d He gestured grandly with his half-eaten flapjack. \u201cHe\u2019s all yours, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo pleased to know that I\u2019ve got your blessing,\u201d Draco said dryly and snagged a piece of bacon off Harry\u2019s plate despite the fact that he still had two slices on his own, and also despite the fact that he\u2019d been swiping pieces from the serving plate for the last twenty minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of blessings,\u201d Harry said, swiping a slice of bacon back from Draco. \u201cIt\u2019s not official until Molly approves. Want to get that out of the way tomorrow afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron froze, second flapjack halfway to his mouth. He\u2019d progressed to using a fork, now, and very slowly set it down. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing him to lunch at the Burrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron watched him for a long moment, then smiled. \u201cOh. You\u2019ve finally got your shit together, then. Good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Harry blinked. \u201cYou knew\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I knew. Hermione told me straightaway after Pansy owled her about this one\u2019s stupid plan,\u201d Ron said, jerking his thumb at Draco. \u201cGlad it worked out, by the way. Congratulations. Ginny thought you\u2019d never get it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGinny knew too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ron said, looking a little sheepish now. \u201cShe got it out of me, you know how quick she is with a Bat Bogey Hex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSo if Ginny knew, then I\u2019m assuming Luna knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Seamus,\u201d Hermione piped up from down the table. \u201cHe overheard Ginny and Luna.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if Seamus knows then everybody else does, too,\u201d Harry grumbled. \u201cReally, was there anyone who didn\u2019t know we were faking it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron shrugged, then got up for seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re terrible,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAll my friends are terrible.\u201d God, he just knew that none of them would ever let him hear the end of this. They'd all be unbearable about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Draco said, then glanced down the table to where Hermione was absorbed in her crossword. He leaned close and murmured in Harry\u2019s ear, \u201cWant to show them how deliriously happy and in love we are, and then fake a break up to make them all suffer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry leaned back to look at him. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco grinned. \u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy,\u201d Harry said reverentially. \u201cYou are perfect for me.\u201d And he kissed him hard.</p>\n<p>Valentine\u2019s Day, he thought. They\u2019d do it on Valentine\u2019s. It was about two months off, the stress of their first Valentine\u2019s as a couple might reasonably push them to their breaking point. It would be perfect.</p>\n<p>All he had to do before then was convince everyone how happy and in love he was. And that, Harry was sure, wouldn't be at all hard to do.</p>"
