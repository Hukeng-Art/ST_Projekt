  "text": "<p>\u201cYou do realize this is the most ridiculous idea ever?\u201d Elena asked Merlin as she sat on his bed and watched him dig through his wardrobe.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Merlin said as he pulled out a shirt and shook it at Elena with a questioning look, when she shrugged noncommittally Merlin hung it back up. \u201cBut I\u2019m still going through with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why you just don\u2019t wait until Lance gets back from Thailand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be back for another six months. I\u2019m twenty-four years old, El, it\u2019s pretty sad that I haven\u2019t had a proper boyfriend yet. I don\u2019t want to be the pathetic sod that\u2019s pined for Lance for four years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I\u2019m an enormous loser that has never been on a real date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that you\u2019re so sure about Lance. I\u2019ve never met anyone so sure. You just <i>know</i>, you know? And I think that\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd pathetic,\u201d Merlin said as he grinned at her over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, that too.\u201d Elena grinned back.</p>\n<p>Merlin sat down beside her on the bed. \u201cI just want to have <i>some</i> experience. I don\u2019t want to be an absolute spaz with Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dated before, you\u2019re not completely clueless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to the cinema with Will and attempting to give him a hand job in the back row is hardly what I\u2019d call a smashing success.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you did try,\u201d Elena said cheerfully. \u201cHow were you to know that old woman would start screeching so loudly when she saw the two of you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey actually <i>stopped</i> the film and escorted us out,\u201d Merlin said, turning red at just the memory.</p>\n<p>Elena bit her lip in thought. \u201cYou went out that one time with Gwaine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t count. He bought me a pint, saw you, and ditched me before I could even finish it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ditch you,\u201d Elena said. \u201cHe did ask if it was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I was going to say no when the two of you were gazing at each with stars in your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that.\u201d Elena frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, not your fault,\u201d Merlin said as he gave Elena\u2019s hand a squeeze. \u201cYou two are much more suited to one another.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Elena said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not backing out on me, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. I told you I\u2019d take you and I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t want to be wasting all of this time over-analyzing every single piece of clothing I own for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still think you should wear the purple button-down, you look lovely in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin got up to pull the shirt out of his wardrobe and hold it up to himself. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena nodded. \u201cReally. With the jeans you\u2019re wearing and that first jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than a gay bestie,\u201d Merlin teased as he took the shirt off the hanger.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elena said smugly as she hung over the side of the bed to dig a pair of shoes out from underneath it. \u201cAnd these shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo tell me about all the cute guys that\u2019ll be there tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to introduce you to Percy first. He\u2019s as big as a fucking mountain but the sweetest person I know. He\u2019s like an overgrown puppy with a big, dumb smile that\u2019s too adorable for words.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds promising.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s also Leon but I\u2019m one hundred percent sure he\u2019s having sexual congress with Mithian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSexual congress. Really, El?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you rather I say that I suspect Mithian straps one on and rides him like a pony? Cos I can word it that way instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErm, no thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Elena said smugly. \u201cBe careful what you wish for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin ignored her. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain Stewart and Aidan are of the gay persuasion and they\u2019re both gorgeous, I\u2019ll be sure to introduce you. I\u2019m also thinking possibly Charlie,\u201d Elena\u2019s voice trailed off as she considered all of the blokes she could potentially set Merlin up with at her work do.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Arthur?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me, no,\u201d Elena said. \u201cNo way. Not a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not, you said he wasn\u2019t picky about the boy and girl bits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a <i>manwhore</i>. No. I\u2019m not subjecting you to Arthur. He\u2019d date a broom if it had tits. Or a dick. And a negative IQ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you said he was gorgeous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he is, and he knows it too. Manwhores are always gorgeous, it\u2019s part of what makes them manwhores, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should date them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seems like the perfect solution. He\u2019d obviously not want a relationship of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn paper he seems the perfect solution, maybe, but in reality? God no. I don\u2019t want you to catch anything.\u201d Elena scrunched up her face at the thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be that awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said he was nice,\u201d Merlin kept at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly nice, a brilliant boss, but as a boyfriend? He\u2019d make your delicate little heart cry within the first fifteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin threw a balled up sock at Elena\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m not some delicate petal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, in regards to Arthur Pendragon you are. He flirts with anything with a pulse, and he\u2019s terribly good at it. Only the hardcore can survive him. You need to take things slow. Think Percy, Merlin, not Arthur. No Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine. No Arthur. Percy,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust keep repeating that mantra and you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Elena said as she got up from the bed to tug at Merlin\u2019s jacket. \u201cGod, you\u2019re gorge. You\u2019ll pull all the boys tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s hoping.\u201d Merlin grinned nervously.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>When Merlin and Elena showed up for the party Merlin got properly snogged by Gwaine, much to Elena\u2019s delight, and was promptly introduced to Percy, Stewart, and Aidan. Elena was holding off on Charlie because she said she had to consult with Gwaine and his gaydar over whether or not Charlie was an option. She always claimed her gaydar worked better when combined with Gwaine\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Merlin thought she was full of shite.</p>\n<p>He was now stood in the corner talking to Percy; who was as gorgeous as Elena had said, and as large - Merlin was getting a crick in his neck just looking up at him - and he was as sweet as could be, but there was just nothing there. Merlin thought he\u2019d like to hang out with Percy as a friend rather than a boyfriend. He inwardly cringed at the thought of having to break the news to Elena, who had been none-too-subtle in introducing them to one another. Merlin had confessed straight off to Percy that he was looking for a date, if he hadn\u2019t already been able to tell that from Elena\u2019s enthusiastic introduction. Thankfully Percy had laughed good-naturedly and said he\u2019d love to have a chat with Merlin despite the fact he considered Elena a good choice for a friend. He\u2019d said it with such fondness Merlin knew Elena was a favorite of Percy\u2019s as well and that he was only joking with him.</p>\n<p>They were having a really lovely chat when Merlin was suddenly bumped into by someone from behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry, mate, didn\u2019t mean to nearly run you over,\u201d a voice from behind Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Merlin said as he started to turn around. \u201cThankfully my drink stayed in my hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank fuck for that, I\u2019d never in my life want to inadvertently murder a perfectly innocent drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had opened his mouth to respond to that idiotic reply but he was stopped short by blond hair and blue eyes and teeth. Teeth everywhere. And a smile. Yeah, a smile too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, Arthur,\u201d Percy said. \u201cYou do realize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, but that\u2019s neither here nor there,\u201d he said as he waved Percy off and directed his attention back to Merlin. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin. I\u2019m called Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin blushed when he realized what he\u2019d said and could hear Percy chuckling quietly at his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic. I\u2019m called Arthur. And he\u2019s called Percy,\u201d Arthur said as he pointed at Percy. \u201cNow we\u2019re all friends. And seeing as how we\u2019re all friends I feel it my duty to rescue you from Perce who, while quite lovely in his own right, is a tremendous bore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou only say that because I think Arsenal is complete crap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI say that because you\u2019re obviously brain damaged and I can tell Merlin is tired of humoring you and your simpleton ways.\u201d Arthur grinned when Percy snorted then swung an arm over Merlin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMerlin, come. I have more interesting things to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saying they\u2019re more interesting doesn\u2019t actually make it true,\u201d Percy said.</p>\n<p>Arthur sighed. \u201cFine. But I\u2019m still taking him, though I didn\u2019t bollocks up his drink it\u2019s in dire need of a refill and I can master that quite nicely. Off you go, Percival.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just as ridiculous as Percy claimed,\u201d Merlin said as he let Arthur drag him over to where the bar was set up.</p>\n<p>Arthur just smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to add charming to the list, or at least make it outrank ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you could try.\u201d Merlin shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa.\u201d Arthur barked out a laugh and slapped Merlin on the back. \u201cNot letting me get too big for my britches, I see. Did Elena get to you first by any chance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin spluttered but he knew he blushed because Arthur just laughed again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a poor liar, Merlin, but fine, I\u2019ll pretend like she didn\u2019t warn you off of me. I suspect the word, \u2018manwhore\u2019 was bandied about, and I should probably fire her, but I enjoy her face around the office too much to actually carry through with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky for her then.\u201d Merlin smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Arthur drew out conspiratorially and Merlin laughed. \u201cSo, what are you drinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhisky. Straight up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur was about to take Merlin\u2019s glass from him, but he stopped, looked at the glass, then up at Merlin, and started laughing this loud, slightly obnoxious and absolutely brilliant laugh that made Merlin laugh right along with him.</p>\n<p>Merlin blushed and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to say that. Somehow saying, \u2018a pina colada straight up\u2019 doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed again and grabbed Merlin\u2019s glass. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a pina colada, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but -,\u201d Merlin began but he was interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbort! Abort! Merlin, abort!\u201d Elena hollered at him as she bee-lined her way toward the two of them, nearly knocking people over in the process. \u201cAbort!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly covert, Elena,\u201d Arthur said and raised an eyebrow at her when she slumped against Merlin\u2019s side, flushed and out of breath.</p>\n<p>She just waved her hand in Arthur\u2019s face. \u201cWhatever. Abort, Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElena,\u201d Merlin sighed. \u201cGood grief.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember your mantra,\u201d she said as she started to drag Merlin away by his arm. \u201cGotta go, Arthur. See you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin rolled his eyes but let Elena drag him away. He turned back when Arthur shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll get you that whisky, Merlin, come hell or high water. I promise you.\u201d Merlin laughed and half waved at him with the hand that was holding his drink. Arthur saluted him with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not actually that bad, Elena.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, Merlin, what did I tell you? That\u2019s what Arthur does. He lures you in and then bam! you\u2019ve slept with him and he never calls you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep with him straight off,\u201d Merlin hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you say that <i>now</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Elena</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me some credit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena sighed. \u201cOkay, okay. I know you can look out for yourself but you\u2019re just such a wee little baby to all this dating, flirting, manwhoring business. I feel like I need to look out for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, El, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena leaned in and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and then looped her arm through his. \u201cSo, what did you and Percy talk about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe talked about what a good fuck Arthur is,\u201d Merlin said as he tried to hide his grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, Merlin,\u201d Elena huffed. \u201cHonestly.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>Merlin suffered through the evening and the rest of Elena\u2019s embarrassing introductions. Each one was worse than the last and by the time he got to Charlie - Gwaine and Elena having decided he was gayer than a pride parade - Merlin was visibly cringing. It didn\u2019t help matters whatsoever that Merlin could see Arthur keeping track of his progress out of the corner of his eye. He was always <i>there</i>, just hovering off to the side and not even trying to hide his amused smile. Merlin couldn\u2019t decide if it was irritating or entertaining.</p>\n<p>He finally broke away from Charlie by claiming he needed to the use the toilet and he was just about home-free when an arm shot out in front of him to block his way through the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a lovely evening?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin turned to look at Arthur who was smiling like an idiot as he kept a steady gaze on Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a lovelier evening,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Arthur said cheerfully. \u201cI think my favorite part was when Elena introduced you to Charlie by telling him you enjoyed mushroom risotto and collecting vintage postcards. Oh, and that you were quite clever at board games. Merlin, I never knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha, laugh all you want, but I actually <i>am</i> quite clever at board games.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just so happens that I adore board games, Monopoly in particular. I play it with my mate, Mithian, and I\u2019m quite pleased to say that I\u2019ve made her cry on several occasions with my pedantic playing strategies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t brag about making your mate cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met her, if you had you\u2019d be extremely impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur took his arm down from the doorway but he leaned against the wall. \u201cSo what\u2019s up with all of these charming Elena introductions? I can\u2019t imagine this is how you wanted to spend your evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly, no,\u201d Merlin admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo -?\u201d Arthur left the word hanging in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m going to tell you anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just taking a chance that you might because I\u2019m incredibly curious why someone as gorgeous as you is allowing himself to be taken to market by Elena. She might as well have had them all check your teeth and your gait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin tried to stop himself from flushing with heat at Arthur calling him, \u2018gorgeous.\u2019</p>\n<p>Arthur kept looking at him and Merlin didn\u2019t know what came over him but there was something in Arthur\u2019s stare that made Merlin want to tell him everything. There was a sincerity in his eyes that made Merlin sigh and answer his question.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if you must know,\u201d he said, \u201cShe\u2019s helping me find a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that was rather obvious, my question is why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I need one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin sighed again. \u201cI need one so I can practice and be able to have a proper date later on. Or at least one without an ill-conceived handjob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHandjob?\u201d Arthur stood up straight and Merlin laughed at his Pavlovian response to the word. \u201cTell me more about that bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Merlin said as he kept laughing. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoilsport,\u201d Arthur grumped.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just admitted to needing practice dates and you want to dwell on the handjob?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged it off. \u201cI can deal with the practice dating weirdness later, but I\u2019ve been fixated with your hands all evening so the handjob is a bit more interesting to me right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin felt himself flushing again and for some reason he shoved his hands behind his back, out of Arthur\u2019s sight. He didn\u2019t know what made him do it but he was suddenly self-conscious after Arthur\u2019s confession. He knew it was just Arthur being ridiculous and flirtatious like Elena always claimed he was, but the thought of Arthur fixating on his hands like that sent a strange little thrill up and down his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, now, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Arthur said as he reached around Merlin and grabbed onto his right wrist to pull his hand out from behind his back. Arthur was so close, and smelt so good, that Merlin found himself leaning a bit closer to him. Arthur\u2019s fingers around his wrist were warm and Merlin didn\u2019t know how to react.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Merlin asked inanely. Arthur just rolled his eyes at him but smiled anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, practice dates?\u201d Arthur asked, his hand still curled around Merlin\u2019s wrist. \u201cDare I ask what they are?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was decidedly unsettled by Arthur holding his wrist, it felt far too intimate and he wanted to pull away but Arthur\u2019s thumb found his pulse point and started rubbing back and forth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re exactly what they sound like, practice dates,\u201d Merlin said with a hint of irritation in his voice, he didn\u2019t like feeling out of sorts in such an unfamiliar way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, where I come from they\u2019re simply called dates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin stared at his wrist and Arthur\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t answer him immediately, but when he did he was oddly candid.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had very few dates, like four actually, and all epically disastrous. There\u2019s someone I like, that I want to date,\u201d Merlin couldn\u2019t look Arthur in the eyes so he kept his gaze down and soldiered on. \u201cProper dates, ones that don\u2019t lead to disaster, so I thought I should practice, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur just hummed and kept his thumb rubbing along the inside of Merlin\u2019s wrist. The quiet sound of Arthur\u2019s hum drew Merlin\u2019s eyes up to his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that stupid?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid isn\u2019t it? Elena and Gwaine think I\u2019m barmy but they\u2019re still helping me because they\u2019re, well, them, and they love me anyway, despite my idiosyncrasies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt sounds fairly logical to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, now I know it must be stupid if you think it makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now,\u201d Arthur laughed, \u201cwhat did I ever do to you to earn such a low opinion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElena\u2019s told me things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElena tells lies, stories, fabricated imaginations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything she tells me sounds fairly legit, especially having now met you for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>Merlin could only smile at the question because Arthur seemed incredibly amused by their entire conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, if that\u2019s the case I think I ought to be one of your practice dates,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIf only to alleviate you of such horrendous and erroneous assumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d Merlin asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell through all of those big, impressive words.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed. \u201cOkay. Fine. I\u2019ll make it simple. You. Me. Food?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin shrugged, but he found himself grinning uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe an ill-conceived handjob?\u201d Arthur added, along with the gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Merlin said as he slapped at Arthur\u2019s hand with his free one. \u201cWhat if someone is looking over here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur seemed terribly unconcerned. \u201cPfft, they\u2019ve all met me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I should find it disturbing that this isn\u2019t out of the ordinary for you,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that later, the important thing right now is whether or not you\u2019ll allow me to be a practice date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was prepared to say no, to heed Elena\u2019s warnings about Arthur, but looking at Arthur standing there in front of him, still holding his wrist gently in his hand, made Merlin rethink his answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, then nodded. \u201cYeah, fine, I\u2019ll go out with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour enthusiasm is making me weak-kneed. Truly, Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin didn\u2019t know what had come over him, he wasn\u2019t usually this way with people he\u2019d never met before. He was never able to joke or tease, at least not successfully, he always seemed to make a tit of himself but Arthur laughed in response and it was all Merlin could do not to smile like a halfwit.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I will, eventually,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cSo are you free tomorrow night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow? So soon? Shouldn\u2019t I play hard to get or something?\u201d Merlin asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to respond.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlaying hard to get is asinine, just a stupid game,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt\u2019s always best to be direct and truthful, don\u2019t play games. That\u2019s lesson number one for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief because I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be completely pants at it if I tried, so, yeah, I\u2019m free tomorrow. Where do you want to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about the classic; dinner and a film?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur smiled at him and asked for his mobile number as he pulled his own out of his pocket to get Merlin\u2019s from him. It was only then, when Arthur let go of him, that Merlin noticed Arthur had still been holding his wrist. They had spent their entire conversation with Arthur leaning into him and holding his wrist. Merlin wondered how they\u2019d looked to anyone that cared to watch them and he felt a momentary rush of white hot anxiety at the thought of being out with Arthur on his own the next evening. He had a feeling that no matter where they went or what he did with Arthur they\u2019d always be on display, noticed, looked at, Arthur was just that sort of person. Merlin? Not so much. He didn\u2019t know if he was anxious with anticipation or anxious from fear at the thought of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look forward to tomorrow, Merlin,\u201d Arthur said quietly once they\u2019d gotten their number situation sorted.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Merlin found himself answering, and actually meaning it.</p>\n<p>Anticipation or fear, it didn\u2019t matter, he was going to do this.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Elena sighed. \u201cWhat did I tell you about Arthur?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo stay away from him and his manwhoring ways?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. And who are you seeing in less than an hour despite repeated warnings?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur and his manwhoring ways?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Now tell me why all of my warnings were in vain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t in vain,\u201d Merlin said as he flopped down next to Gwaine on the couch, who was doing his best at not listening to a word Elena and Merlin were saying and was watching football instead. \u201cHe seemed nice though, I liked him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Elena said. \u201cEveryone likes Arthur, he\u2019s a very likeable guy, and therein lies the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can it possibly be a problem to be likeable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything comes too easily to him, Merlin, and too often. You need to start off with someone more sedate and less Arthur-ish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because he\u2019s dated a great deal doesn\u2019t mean anything at all. We\u2019re only going to the cinema and out for a bite to eat, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s taking me away for a holiday to Paris. We\u2019re being very basic here.\u201d</p>\n<p>There must have been a break in play because Gwaine stretched himself out and then said to Elena, \u201cLet Merlin be, El. Arthur\u2019s hardly going to eat him alive. It\u2019s like Merlin said, they\u2019re only going to see some crap film and eat at an overly posh restaurant. He isn\u2019t likely to break Merlin\u2019s heart in a single evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was fairly impressed Gwaine had been listening to them in the first place, and he was thankful he\u2019d taken his side as well. Once Elena got going there was usually no stopping her. The only one who ever managed was Gwaine.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he just might,\u201d Elena argued as she crossed her arms and glared at Gwaine. \u201cHe\u2019s done it before. He hardly means to, but he does. Arthur just wasn\u2019t meant for a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich should make him perfect for Merlin,\u201d Gwaine said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t interested in a relationship, he\u2019s interested in learning how to not be a complete twat on a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel as if I should thank you, but I\u2019m not sure I will,\u201d Merlin told Gwaine, who only laughed and gave him a small shove.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only looking out for him,\u201d Elena insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to get hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t,\u201d Merlin assured her. \u201cI know you\u2019re irritating me with the best of intentions and I love you for it, but kindly bugger off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena gave him a quick kick to his shin but she rolled her eyes and smiled at him. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll bugger off, but when you\u2019re crying into your ice cream and stacks of chocolate bars don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cI\u2019ll binge eat and weep on my own and never say a word to you about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood man,\u201d Gwaine nodded at Merlin as he absently gave his shoulder a squeeze and turned his attention back to the telly.</p>\n<p>Elena gave him a worried look, but she kept quiet and Merlin was grateful.There was no need to worry.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d be fine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>Arthur had surprised him by meeting him at a nearby tube station, after having traveled on the actual tube, and taking him to a rather small, unassuming restaurant. Merlin had been expecting something posh and was mildly panicking over having to order something dreadful like oysters while pretending he knew which fork to use. Instead he got an enormous plate of pasta and a laughing Arthur trying to eat his own without getting sauce all over himself. Merlin had anticipated being the only clumsy clod and it was a more than pleasant surprise to see Arthur less than perfect. It made Merlin relax and enjoy himself more than he thought he would.</p>\n<p>Arthur had then taken him to the most dreadful film Merlin could remember seeing and he loved every minute.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot honestly tell me you liked that film,\u201d Merlin argued as they left the cinema and headed down the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiked it? No. Loved it with every fiber of my being? Yes.\u201d Arthur was feigning seriousness and Merlin couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re clearly an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a film snob. There was a zombie cat, Merlin. A <i>zombie cat</i>. That alone makes it the most glorious film ever created.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man of simple pleasures, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed. \u201cI am, extremely simple. Give me zombie cats eating brains and I\u2019m beyond thrilled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled and shook his head. \u201cAdmittedly, there\u2019s not many things that are more amazing than a zombie cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur hummed in agreement, but then stopped walking and grabbed Merlin\u2019s elbow to bring him to a stop as well. \u201cUnless there\u2019d be a zombie <i>goat</i>. Oh my god, Merlin, there needs to be a zombie goat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to make that happen then. I\u2019ll ring Hollywood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you?\u201d Arthur asked. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Merlin promised. Arthur smiled and took his hand, wrapping it in that familiar warmth that Merlin had felt surround his wrist the night before. It made his breath catch a bit and he didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. The combination of his hand in Arthur\u2019s and the thought of what he must look like walking along the pavement with someone as beautiful as him made Merlin\u2019s skin prickle with heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Arthur asked as he squeezed Merlin\u2019s hand a bit tighter and gave it a little shake.</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded and managed to get out a, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just figured we\u2019d go for all the dating basics here,\u201d Arthur said as he pulled Merlin closer to his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems logical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing if not logical,\u201d Arthur said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr the exact opposite of logical, you know, either one.\u201d Merlin laughed and Arthur smiled at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you had a good time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin didn\u2019t answer right away because it took him by surprise to realize that he had. \u201cYou know what,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem shocked by the notion,\u201d Arthur said, clearly amused by the situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell all my other ones have been disasters up to this point so, yeah, it\u2019s a bit shocking that something hasn\u2019t gone tragically wrong this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe night is still young.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was hoping for an ill-conceived handjob but I see none are forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNor will they be,\u201d Merlin said as he felt his face flush with heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now, that was a highly traumatic experience in my life, no need to dredge it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely going to dredge it up,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cOn our next date I want all of the details, every minute, embarrassing one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur next date?\u201d Merlin asked and Arthur turned to look at him with a flash of uncertainty in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a next one?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought, maybe, while we\u2019re at it -. But if you don\u2019t want to that\u2019s fine as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason Merlin felt like it really wasn\u2019t fine with Arthur, that they only had this one date, and that made him inexplicably happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin started, \u201cI mean yes, I\u2019d like another, not no, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed softly and it was low and felt sort of intimate in a way that made Merlin aware like he\u2019d never been before. It spoke of possibilities and that want for more, something he hadn\u2019t experienced on any of his other botched dates.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that sentence supposed to make sense?\u201d Arthur asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not sure it did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt did to me,\u201d Merlin blurted out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Arthur smiled, \u201cas long as it did to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you free tomorrow?\u201d The question was out of Merlin\u2019s mouth before he could connect with his brain and stop himself. He was about to take it back, but Arthur answered him before he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does seven sound?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re free tomorrow?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>Arthur nodded. \u201cI am,\u201d he said as he stopped them so he could properly look at Merlin. \u201cAre you really serious about all of this? The practice dating and everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I was, even if it\u2019s a stupid idea I\u2019m still serious about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why you think you need to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it for Lance,\u201d Merlin answered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to muck everything up with him. I want to finally have something real, and I want it with him. Every effort I\u2019ve ever made at something real has ended in either embarrassment or disaster, or both, and I want to figure out how to not be a bumbling tragedy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did just fine with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there was no pressure, if I\u2019d been worried about the outcome I\u2019d probably have vomited on you by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed. \u201cVomit, Merlin? Really? You\u2019re going with vomit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin waved his hand in the air. \u201cWell, you never know. I\u2019m a mess, Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut an endearing mess,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cwhich I believe works in your favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin could only laugh at that. Arthur was being incredibly sweet, which he hadn\u2019t expected based on all the horror stories about his serial dating that he\u2019d heard from Elena. He\u2019d managed to make the entire evening less painfully embarrassing than it could have been. Merlin had mortified himself with his decision to go ahead with it all and was fully prepared to be mortified in actuality during the date, but Arthur was amazingly easy to be with. Merlin could see him as a mate after all of the dating business was over with and that made the evening even easier to get through. Of course there was anxiety and nervousness and the desire to turn tail and run, but Arthur\u2019s carefree smile had made all of that go away.</p>\n<p>They had been walking quietly, still holding hands, when Merlin realized they were just about to his tube stop. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I walk you home? Isn\u2019t that what I\u2019m meant to do on a proper date?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done, Merlin, very gentlemanly, but I promise I won\u2019t hold it against you if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin just managed to stop himself from sighing and rolling his eyes at Arthur. \u201cTomorrow night then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, tomorrow night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was about to let go of Arthur\u2019s hand to head down to his train when Arthur pulled him closer instead and kissed him on his cheek. It was unexpected, and sweet, and it somehow rattled Merlin more than anything else had throughout the night.</p>\n<p>When he pulled back Arthur smiled at him and it was the same reassuring smile that had set Merlin at ease at the beginning of their date, and even though he was still thrown by the kiss he returned the smile with one of his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you,\u201d Arthur said quietly as he took a couple of steps backwards before turning around.</p>\n<p>Merlin gave him a small, awkward wave before Arthur turned his back on him and then watched him walk away before heading down to his train.</p>\n<p>For some reason tomorrow seemed really far away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>Merlin was startled by the abruptness of the question. They hadn\u2019t talked about his ridiculous plans the night before so he\u2019d hoped Arthur would gloss over that bit. He made an awkward sounding noise and grabbed his water glass to take a drink before answering Arthur.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, more of last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a question or a statement?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was about to stumble through another idiotic answer when he looked up at Arthur and saw him smiling at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut it,\u201d Merlin laughed as he sat back in his chair and gave Arthur a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you anything last night because I thought we\u2019d just have a go and see how we got along before figuring out if we should do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you still want to do this?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged. \u201cSure, why not? You had fun, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAside from your terrible taste in films I think the night went rather alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, see, I think we can manage this then. You still want to do it as well, don\u2019t you, even after all the things I\u2019m sure Elena\u2019s filled your head with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin blushed, he didn\u2019t want to tell Arthur that he was right - at least about Elena - she\u2019d given him quite the earful when she heard that not only did he have fun on their date but that he was seeing Arthur again. He didn\u2019t want to repeat some of the things she\u2019d said about Arthur.</p>\n<p>Arthur noticed Merlin\u2019s hesitation because he spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, whatever she said. It\u2019s probably true anyway. We might as well have full disclosure here; I\u2019m a one night stand addict, I\u2019m allergic to relationships of any kind, and I\u2019m probably the most superficial person you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin watched Arthur\u2019s face as he reeled off the list of his faults, watched him as he tried to sound like it didn\u2019t matter, but Merlin could see that it did. There were cracks in Arthur despite the facade he showed to the world. He wasn\u2019t going to prod Arthur about it, he was just content to know at least one small thing about Arthur that he could hold onto.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she also told me you were amazingly kind,\u201d Merlin said instead of telling Arthur he didn\u2019t believe him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a nice guy,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cit still doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in it for the long haul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is why you\u2019re perfect for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Arthur gave Merlin a soft smile and just looked at him for a moment before continuing on, \u201cSo, back to what you want from this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to be more comfortable being out with another man, I\u2019ve been absolute pants at it so far and it\u2019s put me off the entire business. I keep thinking it must be better than this, but it never really is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you even given yourself a chance? How many dates have you actually been on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me,\u201d Merlin said even though he could see Arthur hadn\u2019t been planning on it. Arthur just frowned at Merlin until he responded with a, \u201cSorry, sort of a knee-jerk reaction of mine. Whenever people hear I\u2019ve managed to get to age twenty-four and have only been on four dates they either make fun or give me the pity look.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going for neither, just so you know,\u201d Arthur said.</p>\n<p>Merlin looked at Arthur and saw he was sincere. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged it off. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in the same boat, except for the opposite reason, obviously. When people hear of my miscreant ways they crack smartarse jokes about it or look at me like I\u2019m the most pathetic thing to ever live, so, yeah, I would never do the same to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It looked like Arthur wanted to drop the issue all together so Merlin decided to carry on with their initial conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to do date-y things,\u201d Merlin said and then grinned when Arthur snorted in amusement at the word, \u2018date-y\u2019, \u201cI want to have fun with someone instead of being traumatized by my own awkwardness, I want to be relaxed for a change and have more things to say than just stilted, boring conversations about the weather and what I do for a living, I want know what to do at the end of the night rather than shaking the other person\u2019s hand and acting like a pillock, I want to know how to flirt so the other person knows I\u2019m flirting and not just having a stroke and speaking gibberish. I want to be <i>normal</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin took a breath at the end of his ramble. Arthur stared at him without an ounce of judgment, or really a reaction of any kind that Merlin could figure out, but then he slowly smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Arthur teased.</p>\n<p>Merlin was about to fire off a sarcastic insult, but as always his mouth tripped over his brain and what came out instead was a rush of words.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I want to hold hands again. I want to hold hands and walk down the pavement and have butterflies in my stomach in anticipation of the next time our shoulders will brush and get flushed and warm just thinking about whether or not it was accidental or on purpose.\u201d Merlin stopped and felt his face heat up, but took a breath and repeated quietly, \u201cI want to hold hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin wasn\u2019t sure what Arthur\u2019s reaction was going to be and he definitely wasn\u2019t prepared for Arthur leaning across the table and kissing him. It was a small, soft kiss, but Merlin hadn\u2019t been expecting anything of the sort. He doubted he reacted as gracefully as he could have, and it was over before it had even begun, but it was easily the best kiss he\u2019d ever had. Merlin didn\u2019t say anything as Arthur settled back down in his chair, he just rubbed his lips together hoping to keep the feel of Arthur\u2019s kiss trapped within them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to tell you how sweet you are,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cbut that always sounds incredibly condescending somehow, and yet you are and I can\u2019t figure out a better way to put it. You\u2019re a really good person, Merlin, and it absolutely baffles me that no one has figured that out yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin shrugged, embarrassed, he never could handle compliments. \u201cYeah, well, so far I\u2019ve eluded all the gay men I know. I guess I have a talent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shook his head, unsatisfied with Merlin\u2019s response. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. The more I\u2019m with you the more certain I am that you\u2019ll be the type of person to find someone and love him until the day you die and I think that\u2019s really wonderful. I hope Lance figures out how lucky he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin looked at Arthur, surprised he saw that in him. He\u2019d always felt that way, knew he was too much of a romantic at heart, and was subsequently embarrassed over it, but Arthur made it sound almost perfect. It made Merlin incredibly happy and warm inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said with as much sincere warmth as he could manage with two words. \u201cI hope he does too.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>It was an amazing walk and Merlin hadn\u2019t wanted it to end.</p>\n<p>When they reached his flat Arthur gave him another kiss like the one at the restaurant; soft, quick, just barely there, but it was enough that Merlin closed his eyes to just let it sink in. He felt Arthur\u2019s fingers brush across his lips just before he opened his eyes up again, but the touch was so brief and gone before he could actually see it that he wasn\u2019t sure it had happened.</p>\n<p>Before Arthur let his hand go and turned to leave he\u2019d leaned in and said, \u201cJust so you know, every shoulder brush? Totally on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had laughed at that and Arthur swept in to place a kiss on Merlin\u2019s cheek before walking away. Merlin stood on his front stoop and watched him until he turned the corner and he couldn\u2019t see him any longer.</p>\n<p>He had no idea what Elena was talking about, Arthur couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, now would be the perfect time to ask me up for a drink,\u201d Arthur said.</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed to cover his quick rush of nervousness. \u201cI\u2019m not that sauve. Do I really look like a person that offers people drinks to lure them up to my flat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest?\u201d Arthur asked with a smile. \u201cNo. But you said you wanted to learn how to play the dating game, it\u2019s really past time you ask me up to your place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s hand moved further up Merlin\u2019s thigh and he couldn\u2019t stop staring at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat could I say instead of drinks?\u201d Merlin asked quietly, his eyes still focused on Arthur\u2019s hand. \u201cTo get you up to my flat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest again?\u201d Arthur asked. \u201cPretty much anything at this point. I\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you properly for ages.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mention of a kiss made Merlin turn his focus to Arthur\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have had proper kisses,\u201d Merlin said inanely, thinking of the brief brushes of Arthur\u2019s lips that had happened on their previous dates.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose so, yes,\u201d Arthur said as he leaned toward Merlin, \u201cand that\u2019s the problem, they\u2019ve been far too proper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s eyes nearly crossed following Arthur\u2019s mouth and it took him a moment or two to process what it was Arthur had said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Merlin breathed out. \u201cUm, yeah. Way too proper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should really take care of that,\u201d Arthur said, his lips just hovering over Merlin\u2019s and he felt himself warm up from Arthur\u2019s closeness.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome up to mine?\u201d Merlin asked quietly, simply.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Arthur pulled back from him and gave him a soft smile. \u201cThat was perfect by the way,\u201d he added, \u201cfar better suited to you than asking me up for drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin felt foolishly proud of himself. It was such a simple question, but it was a really big one for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShow me up then,\u201d Arthur prompted when Merlin didn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, sorry. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>They got out of the car and Arthur followed Merlin up the front steps and into his building. Merlin felt what could have been an awkward silence start to build between them as they waited for the lift, which Merlin has happy to see was actually working, but Arthur stayed close to him and kept his hand on the small of Merlin\u2019s back and for some reason that settled Merlin\u2019s racing thoughts.</p>\n<p>Once Merlin had let the both of them into his flat and closed the door behind them Arthur had him in his arms and up against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d he said before pressing a kiss to Merlin\u2019s neck. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind if we start the, \u2018can\u2019t keep our hands off of each other so we wildly make out in the front entry\u2019 portion of the date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s left hand settled on Merlin\u2019s hip and his right slipped around to his back just low enough to make Merlin shiver.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin thought he heard Arthur mutter, \u2018good\u2019 but by then Arthur\u2019s mouth was on his and all he could think about was kissing him. Merlin had been kissed before, sure, but not terribly well and he\u2019d never quite figured out what the big deal about it was. He\u2019d never wanted to just kiss and kiss and kiss someone and never stop, but as Arthur pressed him against the wall and showed him what a kiss was supposed to be Merlin finally got it.</p>\n<p>Kissing Arthur was making him stupidly weak-kneed, which he had no idea was an actual <i>thing</i> until that moment, but as Arthur\u2019s hands tightened their hold on him and his lips parted just the tiniest, teasing bit, Merlin knew he could very easily lose all control in his legs and just slide down the wall to a totally graceless heap on the floor.</p>\n<p>And his thoughts, fuck, his thoughts were scattered all over the place. He was going from incoherence, to panic that he was an absolute shite kisser, and then back to flaming incoherence every other second or so. All he could think was; Arthur, lips, Arthur, Arthur, Arthur, oh fuck, what am I doing, am I doing it right, lips, Arthur, lips, am I the worst kiss of his life, Arthur, Arthur, oh god.</p>\n<p>Merlin hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d tangled his fingers up in Arthur\u2019s hair until Arthur started walking them into Merlin\u2019s flat and towards his couch, Arthur had pulled away for just a second to look where they were walking and Merlin had yanked his lips right back to his own.</p>\n<p>They stumbled onto Merlin\u2019s couch, Arthur ending up on his back with Merlin on top of him. Merlin gasped when he landed and felt the entire length of Arthur pressed against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, sorry,\u201d Merlin gasped as he tried to lever himself off of Arthur.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d Arthur asked as he pulled Merlin back down.</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cObviously nothing,\u201d he said and went right back to kissing Arthur.</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s kisses started getting more and more breathless until finally his hands gripped Merlin by the waist to turn him to his side as he followed suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d Arthur huffed as he laughed and pressed Merlin against the back of the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be insulted by that or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur just smiled against his lips and started kissing him again, but this time the kisses slowed down a bit and they settled into something close to laziness. Merlin was sort of done in by them, it just felt so <i>good</i> being so close to Arthur and just having his arms around him, slowly tasting him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Arthur asked, his hand against Merlin\u2019s jaw and his thumb pressing against his chin.</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded and they bumped noses as he leaned in to kiss him to prove it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHad to slow it down a bit,\u201d Arthur said between kisses. \u201cOtherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin pulled back from Arthur. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, yes, it should be a bit obvious,\u201d Arthur halfway laughed as he shifted a bit and Merlin felt himself blushing a deep red when he latched on to what Arthur was implying. He full out laughed when he saw the expression on Merlin\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Merlin managed to splutter out. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never had that effect on anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin just had to look at Arthur for a while, take him in after he said that. He\u2019d never met anyone who could sincerely compliment as easily as Arthur. He truly believed Arthur meant every word he said, he never pandered to Merlin, never said things simply to get something out of him, and he realized Arthur was amazingly candid in that regard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s you,\u201d Merlin said, wanting to return the kindness. \u201cI think you bring it out in me, whatever it is you see in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes me a good practice boyfriend,\u201d Arthur teased. \u201cI\u2019m building you up so you can go out and break hearts far and wide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s heart, I just want to hold onto the one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur gave Merlin another one of his soft smiles as he traced his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Merlin, you shouldn\u2019t worry so much about being a perfect boyfriend for Lance. I think you\u2019ll naturally do just fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut really, I haven\u2019t done fine. I\u2019ve been an absolute tragedy with everyone but you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur propped himself up on an elbow and looked down at Merlin. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m easy,\u201d he teased.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Merlin said without thinking, when Arthur snorted and laughed Merlin quickly blabbed, \u201cnot like <i>that</i>, god, Arthur. I meant you\u2019re an easy person to be with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur just looked at Merlin for a moment as he slowly traced a finger over the bridge of his nose and across a cheekbone. He seemed sort of lost in thought and Merlin couldn\u2019t resist reaching out and touching Arthur as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Merlin,\u201d Arthur said softly as he pressed a kiss to the corner of Merlin\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Arthur rested against Merlin for a couple of seconds and Merlin felt goosebumps rise up on his skin as Arthur\u2019s warm breath fanned across his neck. Merlin felt absolutely bereft when Arthur slowly pulled away from him and slipped out of his arms as he got up from the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should get going,\u201d Arthur said, with what Merlin hoped was a bit of reluctance in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit too early on for me to overstay my welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin wanted to tell him that that could hardly be possible as he couldn\u2019t imagine wanting Arthur to be anywhere but where he was right then.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want you to feel pressured to do anything more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not that kind of boy,\u201d Merlin teased, and hoped it didn\u2019t fall as flat to Arthur\u2019s ears as it did to his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you again soon though, yeah?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Merlin said as he got up from the couch to walk Arthur out. He reached out and took hold of the back of Arthur\u2019s shirt as he walked in front of him to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Arthur turned back into Merlin and pulled him into a hug. \u201cI had a really great time tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Merlin said as he hugged him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk to you soon,\u201d Arthur said as he gave Merlin one last, quick kiss.</p>\n<p>As Merlin closed the door behind Arthur he tried to stop himself from wishing Arthur would call him from the lift and come right back to his door.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d Merlin said as he went to grab plates and silverware. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I have food. See, already in your good graces and the evening hasn\u2019t even truly begun. Lesson learned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bow down to you, great master of the obvious,\u201d Merlin said as he set a plate in front of Arthur.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, this is sage advice here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat every person with a brain could figure out, I mean who doesn\u2019t like food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, people on a hunger strike?\u201d Arthur asked as he waved his hand in the air. \u201cWork with me here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed and sat down across from Arthur. \u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Arthur said before starting to shovel food onto his plate.</p>\n<p>They ate in companionable silence for a while until Arthur\u2019s foot moved up Merlin\u2019s trouser leg and he flushed red and started to laugh uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arthur asked. \u201cMy feet, I can\u2019t control them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin rolled his eyes at Arthur but stretched out his leg to make it easier for Arthur\u2019s wayward foot to make its way up his leg.</p>\n<p>As they continued eating Merlin noticed Arthur keeping a concentrated eye on him, like he was looking for something, or thinking about how to say something to him which wasn\u2019t like Arthur at all. He usually just said whatever was on his mind at the exact moment it crossed his mind, it was an endearing, and slightly annoying, habit of his.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, last time,\u201d Arthur finally said, \u201cthat was fun, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yeah?\u201d Merlin mumbled around a mouthful of thai noodles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should do that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin hummed his agreement and kept eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are your thoughts on sex?\u201d Arthur asked casually as he sat back in his chair and watched Merlin. \u201cWe should have it, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin choked on his noodles and tried not to spit them all over his plate. \u201cWhat?\u201d he managed to cough out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSex. We should have it,\u201d Arthur repeated, as if that helped matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Okay.\u201d Merlin suspected there was steam coming off of his face since it felt like it was burning off.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pressure you, I\u2019m just curious as to how far you want us to go with the whole boyfriend thing. Do you want to practice that aspect too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Merlin said as he dropped his head onto the table next to his plate, \u201cwhat is my life?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur just reached across the table to pat Merlin on the head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Merlin groaned as he swatted Arthur\u2019s hand away and sat back up. \u201cThis is such an embarrassing conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut one we need to have,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cI want to know where we stand on this. Is it something you want us to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin thought about his one epic failure with full on sex and cringed. Yet another thing he\u2019d been abysmal at and couldn\u2019t see the point of repeating. Logically he knew it was just that one time and that sex was actually fun, but he had never been able to move past it, especially when he\u2019d never been on a date with anyone he\u2019d want to have actual sex <i>with</i> until Arthur.</p>\n<p>And there was his answer right there. He wanted to have sex with Arthur, with Arthur and his face and his mouth and his arms and his hands, and well, pretty much all of him. Plus he obviously knew what he was doing so that was always a bonus. The only thing Merlin was dreading was how awful <i>he\u2019d</i> be at it. He could absolutely picture Arthur having to stop halfway through to laugh uncontrollably at Merlin\u2019s complete and utter lack of skills of any kind.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have had sex before, right?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally bad sex, but yeah, I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, see, now\u2019s the time to improve on that really bad sex and transform it into really average sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cYou sell it so well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d sound like a pompous twat if I told you the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is -?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMind. Blown.\u201d Arthur said as he spread his hands out in front of him.</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed again. \u201cCompletely unlike how I\u2019d sell myself: Life. Traumatised.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed at that but reached across the table to grab Merlin\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>And somehow, inexplicably, Merlin believed him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, stop talking so loudly,\u201d Merlin said to Elena as they sat eating brunch in a very crowded restaurant.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Gwaine mumbled around a mouthful of eggs. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your cock\u2019ll fall off if you don\u2019t use it soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d Elena said as she waved her knife at Gwaine. \u201cShut up and eat your food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gwaine saluted her and went back to his plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I\u2019m having sex with him, what on earth is wrong with that?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you haven\u2019t anywhere to be,\u201d Elena said, \u201cthe list is long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop. Just stop,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any of it because I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what you object to in this situation. I\u2019m not looking for longterm here, you know what I want out of it all and you know that Arthur is exactly the sort I need so I really wish you\u2019d stop having a freak out everytime I tell you something about us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that\u2019s the way you see it, Merlin, and yes, on paper Arthur is exactly the sort that you need. I don\u2019t have any objections to that part of the plan, but the thing that I worry about is the other side of Arthur; the side that\u2019s kind and caring despite what he says and does, the side that gets him into trouble because it\u2019s the side that his flings fall for, and it\u2019s the side that causes them heartache. People fall for Arthur, Merlin, he doesn\u2019t mean for it to happen and he always feels badly about it afterward but it doesn\u2019t erase the fact that it happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin reached over and took Elena\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you\u2019re looking out for me and I love you for it, you know I do, but you also know I\u2019ve been stupidly in love with Lance for the last four years of my life. He\u2019s my best friend and all I\u2019ve ever wanted but have been too afraid to go after, but now that he\u2019s gone to Thailand I have the chance to get the courage I need to go after what I want. Arthur\u2019s going to help me, that\u2019s it, El. I\u2019m hardly going to throw away four years of my life and the person I know I\u2019m supposed to be with for a guy I\u2019ll have only known a few months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena slumped down in her chair. \u201cI wish I could believe that, Merlin, but I know you, I know how you wear your heart on your sleeve, and I know Arthur and all I can think about is how this is all going to end really really badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to weigh in on this too?\u201d Merlin asked Gwaine. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I need to even guess that you\u2019re on her side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not on anyone\u2019s side,\u201d Gwaine said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you have an opinion, surely, you have one about everything else I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gwaine leaned forward and looked at Merlin. \u201cYou really want my opinion?\u201d he asked, \u201cMy honest to god opinion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do, I wouldn\u2019t have asked otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think El\u2019s right, and it\u2019s not because I want to have sex again sometime in my lifetime,\u201d Gwaine added quickly before Merlin could make a smartarse comment. \u201cBut because I know you\u2019re not a coward. I\u2019ve never ever known you to be one, so if you were one hundred percent sure that Lance was the one you wanted you would\u2019ve gone after him no matter what your history. You\u2019re a ridiculous, romantic little sod and you make grand gestures even if you know you\u2019ll be embarrassed in the end and yet you haven\u2019t with Lance. I know the both of you and the way you are together, and yes, you two would make sense in a really nice, really sedate kind of way, but there\u2019s more to you, Merlin. You\u2019re not waiting for courage, you\u2019re waiting for <i>more</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. That,\u201d Elena said as she pointed at Gwaine.</p>\n<p>Merlin didn\u2019t know if he could open his mouth without shouting at the both of them so he sat there quietly for a moment or two before gaining enough control to speak again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to know how little you think of me and my ability to know what\u2019s best for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Gwaine said, \u201cthat\u2019s not what I meant and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Merlin said as he waved his hand around. \u201cApparently I\u2019m too simple to grasp human emotions, thankfully the two of you are here to remind me of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin got up from his chair to leave, both Elena and Gwaine grabbed at a wrist to try to pull him back down into his chair, but he yanked his hands away from them.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now, okay,\u201d he said as he pulled on his jacket. \u201cYou just need to leave me alone for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin managed to walk out of the restaurant without stomping out like a four year old, and he was thankful that Elena and Gwaine knew enough to shut up and let him do it. Once he was out on the pavement he shoved his hands into his pockets and tried to get his anger under control.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t believe the two of them, acting like they knew what was best for him and being so damn condescending about it. And for them to have waited so long to say anything about it, granted he\u2019d never been as serious before and had never actively done anything about it, but still, they both knew how he felt about Lance and now that he was <i>finally</i> doing something about it they decide to open their gobs?</p>\n<p>It was completely unfair of them and Merlin had every reason to be angry. Every reason.</p>\n<p>Which really didn\u2019t explain why he was feeling the beginning quivers of doubt deep down in his gut.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told them?\u201d Arthur asked, and Merlin could feel him twist a bit as he looked down at him.</p>\n<p>Merlin shrugged. \u201cYeah. I pretty much tell them everything. Does that bother you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not. You can tell them whatever you like,\u201d Arthur said and turned back to the television. \u201cWhy are they freaking out though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell technically Elena is the one doing most of the freaking out, Gwaine\u2019s too lazy to freak out full throttle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElena warning you off of me again?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod yeah, like waving a pitchfork in my direction warning me off. She thinks you\u2019re going to break my heart.\u201d Merlin snorted.</p>\n<p>Arthur didn\u2019t laugh as Merlin had expected him to do, he\u2019d just hummed quietly and asked, \u201cYou mean the heart that belongs to Lance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Merlin said as he sat up to fully look at Arthur. \u201cThat\u2019s what I told her. I wish she\u2019d stop nattering on about it, you can\u2019t break a heart that belongs to someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s only looking out for you. You\u2019re lucky having someone care for you that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Merlin huffed as he slumped back against Arthur.</p>\n<p>They were quiet for a while and kept their eyes on the TV, though Merlin was fairly certain neither one of them were paying attention to what was on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about Lance much,\u201d Arthur said as he broke their quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019d think you\u2019d want to talk about him all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, it\u2019s just that, well, I want to keep him separate from all of this, from us. It just feels weird talking about him when I\u2019m with you. Why do you even want to know about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. I want to know what it is about him that made someone like you love him so much. I was just thinking he must be pretty special, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin felt like a dick not wanting to talk about Lance with Arthur, but it was so awkward. His and Arthur\u2019s situation was strange at the best of times, and adding in him waxing poetic about Lance would just send it into territory Merlin didn\u2019t want to travel to. He was fine with what he was doing as long as he focused on Arthur alone when he was with him, if he thought about anything, or anyone, else it would all come crashing down on him. He knew he was compartmentalizing things like a pro, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself from doing it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Merlin said, \u201cit\u2019s just weird. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Arthur said as he laid his hand on Merlin\u2019s thigh. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin ran his hand over Arthur\u2019s. \u201cYeah, I knew you would,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re kind of amazing like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides, we should really talk about sex instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cAnnnd you ruined the moment. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur grinned at him. \u201cWhat? Can you blame me? I get to fluster you <i>and</i> figure out when I\u2019m going to ravish you, it\u2019s a win-win all around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRavish me? You\u2019re such a loser.\u201d Merlin burst out laughing when Arthur grabbed at his sides and went to the exact place he knew Merlin was the most ticklish. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I ever thought you\u2019d be a good fake boyfriend,\u201d Merlin spluttered out between fits of laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you thought I was hot,\u201d Arthur said as he maneuvered Merlin onto his back with himself on top of him. \u201cMy raging masculinity overwhelmed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin snorted and smacked at Arthur\u2019s leg with his foot. \u201cOh god, yes, it gave me a raging boner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed at that then leaned down to kiss Merlin, his hands framing Merlin\u2019s face, and his fingers threaded through his hair. It was so easy, and fun, and <i>perfect</i> that Merlin couldn\u2019t believe how lucky he\u2019d gotten finding Arthur at all. He could happily spend hours beneath Arthur; kissing him, touching him, and feeling so damn warm inside.</p>\n<p>Merlin couldn\u2019t stop himself from moving up into Arthur, rolling his hips and hooking a leg around the back of Arthur\u2019s thigh. Arthur moved a hand from Merlin\u2019s face to grasp at his hip, Merlin loved the way Arthur\u2019s fingers dug into him, the way Arthur held him made him feel wanted, maybe even desired, and he\u2019d never felt that way before.</p>\n<p>Arthur moved with Merlin and before long Merlin found himself all but rutting against Arthur\u2019s thigh. He was gasping into Arthur\u2019s kisses and seeking any kind of friction to ease the want settling into every part of him and the heavy ache of his cock.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what you want,\u201d Arthur whispered against his jaw.</p>\n<p>Everything. Merlin wanted everything but he didn\u2019t know how to make himself say the word without sounding pathetically desperate and pleading.</p>\n<p>Merlin dug his fingers into the hair at Arthur\u2019s nape and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you do. Tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t -,\u201d Merlin began to say but Arthur stopped him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do. Tell me. Don\u2019t be embarrassed about what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur had pulled away from him slightly and was looking down at him, trying to get Merlin to make eye contact with him. All Merlin wanted to do was press his face against Arthur\u2019s neck and hide but he forced himself to look up at him. All he saw was genuine curiosity, Arthur\u2019s face was open and free of any judgment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be awful at anything we do,\u201d Merlin answered truthfully. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looked down at him, brushed a thumb under his eye along his cheek, then leaned down to quietly speak. His mouth was brushing against Merlin\u2019s skin and he was so close Merlin closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cwe\u2019ll work at the not being awful part together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin let out a small puff of laughter and he felt Arthur smile against his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Merlin said, \u201cyou\u2019re not awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how do you know?\u201d Arthur asked as his hand made its way underneath Merlin\u2019s shirt to rest against his stomach. \u201cI could very well be the worst ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin argued, \u201cthat would be my first boyfriend, Harry, who managed to get just the tip in before coming all over himself and shouting, \u2018fuck,\u2019 at the top of his lungs so that my mum came running into my room to see what was the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin jumped at the loud bark of laughter that came out of Arthur at that confession.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Merlin said as he slapped Arthur\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, you\u2019re brilliant,\u201d Arthur said to him as he smattered kisses across Merlin\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely brilliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad someone thinks so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur levered himself up, his hand still warm against Merlin\u2019s stomach, as he looked down at him. \u201cI can safely say that I\u2019ll at least manage to get more than the tip in before coming all over myself and shouting, \u2018fuck,\u2019 as loudly as I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>Arthur smiled down at him then and Merlin felt everything inside of him settle. It was the strangest feeling, but he just knew in that moment that everything would be fine, and even if it wasn\u2019t it was okay because it eventually would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready to do this?\u201d Arthur asked quietly.</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looked at him with such a relieved, <i>pleased</i>, expression on his face that Merlin couldn\u2019t help but smile at him. He couldn\u2019t entirely believe that Arthur, <i>Arthur</i>, had been worried about him actually saying no. Merlin would\u2019ve had to have been more than slightly mental to say no.</p>\n<p>Merlin lightly pushed at Arthur\u2019s chest to get him to sit up and allow Merlin to slip out from beneath him. Once he was standing again he stretched his hand out toward Arthur and felt the most wonderful, secret thrill race through him when Arthur reached out his own and took it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBedroom\u2019s this way,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>Arthur stood up and followed Merlin. Once they were inside Merlin\u2019s bedroom Arthur started stripping off his clothes and tossing them into a pile on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Merlin asked, equal parts amused and panicked.</p>\n<p>Arthur hopped around as he struggled with a sock. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d get this bit taken care of,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cit might make you feel slightly more comfortable to be at the advantage here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your being naked will help with that?\u201d Merlin stuttered.</p>\n<p>Arthur was down to his boxer-briefs by then and he just looked at Merlin and shrugged before he hooked his fingers into the waistband and slid them down his hips and to his ankles. Merlin almost choked when he kicked them off completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m the naked weirdo who should be massively embarrassed and you can just sit there and point and laugh at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin sank down onto the side of his bed and just looked at Arthur incredulously, he couldn\u2019t decide if the gesture was flat out crazy or incredibly sweet in a really twisted sort of way. All he could do was snort in a mixture of amusement and disbelief. Arthur, who had been keeping a keen eye on Merlin, just laughed, a full out, infectious kind of laugh that made Merlin join him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re certifiable,\u201d Merlin managed to get out as he held his side and kept laughing at Arthur who was slouched slightly forward and still laughing at himself as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee,\u201d Arthur said once he\u2019d managed to get himself under control. \u201cembarrassment averted, now you can rest easy in the fact that whatever you do it couldn\u2019t possibly be as embarrassing as this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had pulled his feet up onto the bed and was sitting cross-legged as he watched Arthur, who by then had done a little dance and was standing stranded in the middle of Merlin\u2019s bedroom with a gorgeous flush to his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if I\u2019m experiencing secondhand embarrassment on your behalf now?\u201d Merlin asked, hoping to distract Arthur into talking so he could keep looking at him.</p>\n<p>Merlin had never really gotten a proper look at a naked man before, well, one that was actually in his presence at least. And god, was Arthur naked. And equal parts beautiful and ridiculous. Merlin couldn\u2019t deny that there was an inherent absurdity about naked men, what with all their bits just <i>there</i> and flopping about. Cocks and balls were just fucking funny and Merlin would never be accused of being overly mature about anything, much less this, but beyond all of that there was sort of a sweet vulnerability to it too and Arthur putting himself on display like that, laying it all out there as it were, made Merlin feel unbearably fond. But then his focus turned to the rest of Arthur; his chest, the curve of his neck into his strong shoulders, his stomach, and his fucking edible thighs, and he was left a bit breathless by the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, bless your precious, tender little heart, Merlin,\u201d Arthur teased and Merlin just snorted at him.</p>\n<p>Arthur seemed to be done with his preening because he walked over to Merlin and knelt down in front of him and took his hands in his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever you want tonight,\u201d Arthur said, his voice clear and earnest and his eyes focused on Merlin\u2019s. \u201cYou call all the shots, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Merlin\u2019s heart pinged at that, he couldn\u2019t help it, Arthur was too good to him and he couldn\u2019t figure out what he\u2019d done to get so lucky.</p>\n<p>Merlin gently pulled one of his hands out of Arthur\u2019s grip and smoothed it along his jawline.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to show me everything,\u201d Merlin said with complete and utter sincerity, because he found he meant every word of it, he wanted everything from Arthur in that moment. He was ravenous for it and wanted all that Arthur was willing to give.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that might take more than one night.\u201d Arthur smiled at him. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see what we can manage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur rose up to kiss Merlin and Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur\u2019s shoulders, revelling in the feel of his warm, bare skin. When Arthur crawled up onto the bed Merlin unfolded his legs and spread them to draw Arthur down between them. He moved his hands from Arthur\u2019s shoulders down to his hips and as he felt Arthur move against him he wanted to feel Arthur\u2019s skin against his own. He wanted nothing between him and the feel of Arthur\u2019s cock growing heavy and warm against his thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cMine too,\u201d Merlin gasped against Arthur\u2019s lips as he pulled at his shirt with one hand. Arthur seemed to get the message and pulled back enough to push his hands up under Merlin\u2019s shirt. Merlin\u2019s breath hitched and his stomach jumped when he felt Arthur\u2019s hands on him. He let go of Arthur\u2019s hip with his other hand to help him push his shirt up and over his head. They both laughed breathlessly when it got stuck on his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody big ears,\u201d Merlin huffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love your ears,\u201d Arthur said before kissing along the curve of one and taking the earlobe gently between his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would, you exhibitionist weirdo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin could feel Arthur\u2019s lips turn into a smile and it made him feel so damn warm. Just to have Arthur in his arms, pressed against him and wanting him, and smiling that stupidly beautiful smile of his sent Merlin\u2019s heart racing.</p>\n<p>Arthur moved down to Merlin\u2019s chest and pressed a trail of kisses across it as Merlin dug his fingers into Arthur\u2019s hair. Merlin\u2019s breathing picked up as Arthur made his way down his chest to his stomach and over to the dip of his hip that was just peeking out from his jeans.</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s hands traveled over his skin and came to settle on his belt buckle. He looked up at Merlin with questioning eyes until Merlin breathed out a, <i>\u2019yes,\u2019</i>. Arthur tugged at the buckle and got to Merlin\u2019s zip. Merlin pushed down on his waistband helping Arthur as he pulled down on Merlin\u2019s jeans. Arthur gripped the fabric so tightly at Merlin\u2019s hips that he pulled Merlin\u2019s boxers with them. Merlin lifted his hips to help Arthur along.</p>\n<p>Merlin shivered when Arthur tossed his jeans aside and settled back between his thighs, taking his cock in his hand. Arthur gently stroked him as he brushed his lips along the side of Merlin\u2019s cock. His breath was warm on Merlin\u2019s skin and it was the most delicious, agonizing sort of teasing Merlin had ever experienced. He didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to push up into Arthur\u2019s mouth or tell him to never stop those barely there touches.</p>\n<p>Arthur rubbed his thumb over the tip of Merlin\u2019s cock and he pushed up into Arthur\u2019s hand and all but begged him with a moan. Arthur finally took him in his mouth and Merlin had to bite his lip to keep from crying out. When Arthur started holding him at the hips it was all Merlin could do not come right then, the feel of Arthur\u2019s hands holding him down switched over something deep inside him, made him feel needy and on the brink.</p>\n<p>Suddenly Arthur\u2019s mouth was gone and Merlin realized he had closed his eyes against the sensations, he opened them and reached out for Arthur, wanting to drag him back down, but he was already off the bed and digging around in his jeans pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought these, just in case,\u201d Arthur said dropping some packets at Merlin\u2019s side as he sat down on the bed and kissed the inside of Merlin\u2019s knee. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d have anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin felt himself blushing as he picked up the condoms and packets of lube. He felt so stupid, of course he didn\u2019t have anything, well, condoms at least, and he blushed at the thought of what an idiot he had been not thinking to buy anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Arthur said, rubbing slowly up and down Merlin\u2019s leg, \u201cit\u2019s not like we planned it for tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s something I should have had,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cNormal people have that kind of stuff. God. I mean how pathetic am I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur moved so that he was hovering over Merlin and looking down at him. \u201cShut up already,\u201d he said, \u201cand just focus on me. None of that other stuff matters right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin turned to look up at Arthur and saw that it really didn\u2019t matter, Arthur had it all covered, they were fine, all Merlin needed to do was let go of his doubts and just go for it. \u201cYeah,\u201d Merlin nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Arthur said as he moved back and slid his hands down the insides of Merlin\u2019s thighs. \u201cReady for more?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Merlin nodded Arthur reached for a packet of lube and coated his fingers. Merlin\u2019s stomach dropped, he was nervous and excited and wanted Arthur so damn much that he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous,\u201d Merlin quietly said as he ran his hands over Arthur\u2019s shoulders. He sat up enough so he could reach Arthur and kiss him. Arthur opened up to him and somehow the kiss was more than the other ones they\u2019d shared. Merlin felt like it was the beginning of everything else that was going to follow.</p>\n<p>Arthur lingered over the kiss but then pulled away and kissed his way back down Merlin\u2019s chest and stomach to his cock. He took Merlin back in his mouth and the shock of it was just as intense as the first time. Merlin was pretty sure Arthur\u2019s had a fucking perfect mouth and he could have laughed with stupid giddiness at the thought.</p>\n<p>Just looking down at Arthur and seeing that perfect mouth wrapped around his cock was enough to nearly push him over the edge, but it was Arthur\u2019s fingers gently brushing beneath his balls to his hole, teasing him until Merlin arched his hips up, that were making him even more crazy. When Arthur started to push a finger inside him Merlin moaned at the foreign feeling of it. He\u2019d fingered himself a few times, had loved it, but having Arthur being the one between his legs was something else entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Arthur asked, his mouth against the inside of Merlin\u2019s thigh, still near his cock and so damn intimate he almost said, no, no it wasn\u2019t okay, it was all too much, but he nodded, moaned again, and Arthur pressed further inside him.</p>\n<p>It was agony, the anticipation, Merlin wanted to push down, force Arthur in further, but the slow burn was almost delicious. He didn\u2019t know it could feel that way, that it wasn\u2019t just quick and awkward and over too soon, that everything could be drawn out and slow.</p>\n<p>Arthur kept at Merlin with just one finger, his other hand lazily stroking Merlin\u2019s cock, and it was too much. Merlin had to ask for more. He looked down and saw a small smile curve up the corners of Arthur\u2019s mouth as he pressed his face back into Merlin\u2019s thigh, almost as if to hide his delight, and Merlin\u2019s heart clenched at the sight. It was so much the opposite of what he\u2019d expected, that Arthur\u2019d be sure of himself in an endearingly cocky way, but this Arthur was so much softer and Merlin reached down to brush his fingers through Arthur\u2019s fringe. His fingers curled up, tightened, in Arthur\u2019s hair when he pushed a second finger inside Merlin.</p>\n<p>It seemed to go on forever, like Arthur was a kid in a fucking sandbox and couldn\u2019t be bothered to want to be anywhere else but between Merlin\u2019s thighs stroking him, teasing him, bringing him to the brink of the most intense pleasure he\u2019d ever experienced. When Arthur added a third finger Merlin was already twisting under him, writhing and all but whimpering over each wave of heat that washed over him. It was such a glorious agony.</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, oh god,\u201d Merlin gasped, his fingers still twisted in Arthur\u2019s hair and alternating between pushing him away and pulling closer, senseless as to what he was doing. He wanted to articulate that he was coming, but he couldn\u2019t get out the words before he was spilling all over Arthur\u2019s hand and his face, his fucking gorgeous face with Merlin\u2019s come across his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck. Oh <i>fuck</i>,\u201d Merlin moaned as he turned his knees in, curled his toes up into the duvet, trying to twist up into himself and trap all the lingering waves of pleasure skipping through him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know,\u201d Merlin sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s mouth was at his hip, and his fingers still inside him lazily fucking in and out. \u201cKnow what?\u201d he mouthed against Merlin\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat it\u2019s like for me,\u201d Merlin swallowed around his words, still trying to find his voice and the energy to speak. \u201cGod. To feel that way. I\u2019ve never -.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin felt more than heard Arthur\u2019s low laughter. \u201cI think I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember what it was like, that first time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin turned his head to the side, buried it in the pillow. \u201cI only wish you\u2019d had been my actual first time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have handled me, Merlin,\u201d Arthur said in an entirely serious voice and Merlin let out a burst of laughter that was quickly followed by one of Arthur\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a twat,\u201d Merlin said as he smiled down at Arthur.</p>\n<p>Arthur pulled his fingers out of Merlin, who knew he must have whimpered pathetically at the loss, and moved up the bed until he was curled beside him. He smiled at him and kissed the side of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you enjoy my company anyway,\u201d he murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you do <i>that</i> -,\u201d Merlin said and Arthur laughed. Merlin watched as he rolled off the bed and went into the bathroom to wash the lube off of his fingers. When he came back into the bedroom Merlin noticed he hadn\u2019t exactly been reciprocal with the attention. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he said, turning red, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was so selfish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Arthur asked as he crawled back into bed next to Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <i>that</i>, obviously,\u201d Merlin said as he waved at Arthur\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Arthur just laughed. \u201cWho says we\u2019re done yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, probably my body since I can barely move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLazy sod,\u201d Arthur said as he moved on top of Merlin, his body just hovering over him. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to do all the work this time too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy laziness is all your fault so deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed and laid himself down on top of Merlin and started kissing him. The kisses were slow at first, just as lazy as Merlin himself, but then Arthur started deepening the kisses and they started to fill Merlin up with this kind of insatiable need. He felt a bit like he was devouring Arthur as he grabbed at him, swept his hands over every piece of him he could touch as he arched his body up into him and felt a surge of want run through him. All of Merlin\u2019s lethargy was forgotten with Arthur\u2019s kisses and the feel of his cock rubbing up against the inside of Merlin\u2019s thigh, hard and insistent, and he wanted all of it. Everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want more?\u201d Arthur asked, his lips still against Merlin\u2019s mouth, words spoken between kisses.</p>\n<p>Merlin shook his head yes, he didn\u2019t trust himself to say actual words that made sense at the moment. All he could concentrate on was the feeling rushing through him; he was loose-limbed and so full of desire for Arthur, he\u2019d never felt that kind of need so clearly, it was piercing in its intensity. He reached for a condom and tried to tear it open with his shaking fingers. Arthur was patient with him as he tried to roll it onto his cock. It took a couple of tries and Arthur\u2019s hand on his wrist to hold him steady but he managed to roll it on. It was a foolish little accomplishment but every small step he took made him feel more confident and self-assured.</p>\n<p>Merlin gripped Arthur\u2019s hips when he pushed into him and felt like he lost his breath altogether as he felt the burn slowly give way to something so much more than he could have imagined. Arthur took his time and Merlin was alternately thankful and frustrated because he wanted all of Arthur, every part of him. He wanted Arthur inside him and his arms and legs firmly wrapped around him so he stayed as close as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Arthur whispered in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod yes,\u201d Merlin breathed.</p>\n<p>Arthur started moving a little faster and the desperation for him, instead of slacking, seemed to heighten and all Merlin could do was hold onto him, cling really, and ride it out. He got hard again embarrassingly quickly, but every thrust of Arthur\u2019s hips sent jolts of shocked pleasure through him. In the back of his mind he had known it could be like this, that it had to be otherwise people wouldn\u2019t nearly kill themselves trying to get it, but it was still a little too overwhelming to take in.</p>\n<p>Merlin could barely catch his breath and with Arthur whispering in his ear, saying things that went straight to his cock; dirty, filthy things mixed with words sweet and full of pride telling Merlin he was amazing, fucking perfect, and he believed in that moment he was.</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d Arthur said in his ear. \u201cBring yourself off, I want to feel you around me when you come all over yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed sort of crazily, embarrassed but wanting exactly that. Arthur moved back from him, sat back on his knees and hooked his arms under Merlin\u2019s own knees. He hiked Merlin\u2019s legs up and dragged him down the bed so his hips lifted up as Arthur fucked into him. Arthur was watching him so intently he almost felt embarrassed taking his cock in his hand and starting to stroke himself but once he did the look that came into Arthur\u2019s eyes was enough to make him start stroking faster. He was so fucking close anyway that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered for long, his embarrassment, because he had to touch himself, bring himself off.</p>\n<p>\u201cGorgeous,\u201d Arthur whispered.</p>\n<p>Merlin wanted to say it in return, he wanted to say so many things, but he was nearly out of his mind with all the new sensations swarming through him that all he could do was try to breathe beyond gasping as he came. He lost any sense he had left when Arthur let go of one of his legs to run his hand through the come on Merlin\u2019s stomach before wrapping his hand around Merlin\u2019s and stroking his cock with him through the slippery mess. Still hard and coming down from his second high, Merlin\u2019s cock was so damn sensitive to the touch that he wanted to shove Arthur\u2019s hand away, but he loved how slowly, how carefully he was stroking him. Arthur had slowed down his fucking as well, seemingly mesmerized by touching Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I good?\u201d Merlin asked, suddenly wracked with doubt. Arthur hadn\u2019t come yet and he didn\u2019t know what he should do.</p>\n<p>Arthur looked up at him then and stilled his hips and his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you good?\u201d Arthur repeated Merlin\u2019s question in disbelief. \u201cOh god,\u201d he said as he moved to wrap Merlin\u2019s legs back around his hips and leaned down to speak against Merlin\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur\u2019s shoulders and arched up into him, kissed him, and marvelled how Arthur could say that with so much sincerity. Merlin knew he was awkward and that he flailed around and was hopelessly inept at anything having to do with sex, but there Arthur was making him feel like it was the opposite of all those things.</p>\n<p>As Arthur kissed him back he picked up the speed of his thrusts again, his breathing becoming more shallow the more they kissed until he gasped Merlin\u2019s name into his mouth. Merlin felt Arthur still against him, felt the shudder that ran through him. He slid one of his hands down Arthur\u2019s back to the curve of his arse and to his hip where he held him tightly. Arthur\u2019s ragged breaths sounded incredibly loud in his ear and he as he settled himself down on top of Merlin.</p>\n<p>They were both hot, slightly sweaty, and fastly becoming incredibly sticky in all the wrong places, but Merlin didn\u2019t want Arthur to move and didn\u2019t let him go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad yourself,\u201d Merlin quietly teased as he ran a hand up and down Arthur\u2019s back. He felt Arthur\u2019s answering snuffle of amusement and soft rumble of laughter against his jaw and along his neck. \u201cMind, I\u2019ve had better though,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed softly again. \u201cOh god, not even better than Halfway In Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, not even close,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cAnd that would be Just The Tip Harry, halfway in would\u2019ve been an accomplishment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI take back all the nice things I\u2019ve said about you,\u201d Arthur said into Merlin\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled and turned his head into Arthur so he could find his lips and kiss him again. Those lips of his were quickly becoming one of Merlin\u2019s favorite things.</p>\n<p>Arthur finally had to move off of Merlin, ease out of him. Merlin didn\u2019t want to tell Arthur he felt strangely empty now, without him. He just watched Arthur get up and take care of the condom and get a cloth to clean the both of them up. When he started gathering up his clothes Merlin sat up in bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>Arthur didn\u2019t look at him when he answered. \u201cYeah, thought it\u2019d be a bit weird if I stayed? I dunno, this being what it is I shouldn\u2019t exactly stay the night, should I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin wanted to say, yes, stay the night, please, but Arthur already had his underwear and socks back on and was getting a leg into his jeans and it seemed like maybe he shouldn\u2019t say anything at all. They were what they were. Right?</p>\n<p>When Arthur was completely dressed he turned back to look at Merlin to see he had been watching him the entire time. He moved to sit down on the side of the bed next to Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d he said. \u201cReally good, and if this was different -.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin watched Arthur closely, he\u2019d yet to see him at a loss for words about anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were amazing, Merlin,\u201d he whispered instead before he gave Merlin a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Merlin could answer him properly he was out the bedroom door. Merlin listened carefully for the front door of his flat to close behind Arthur before he gripped the sheets and willed himself not to get up and chase after Arthur.</p>\n<p>Because that would just be pathetic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>Merlin looked down at his mobile and frowned, but before he could respond it beeped for a new message.</p>\n<p>\n<i>the leaving, i mean, not the before.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Merlin was stupidly relieved Arthur had clarified. A moment of absolute panic had overcome him with the first text. He\u2019d been about ready to leap off a building. Well, maybe not a building, but definitely his desk.</p>\n<p>\n<i>yeah. really weird.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>i\u2019d rather it wasn\u2019t. we should try it again.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>we should.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>but talk first?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>definitely.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled to himself as he pocketed his phone after making plans with Arthur for the next evening. He almost wanted to save the texts to show to Elena so he could tell her to suck it, Arthur wasn\u2019t a completely emotionally stunted twat.</p>\n<p>But that would\u2019ve been really immature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>After that groundbreaking bit of conversation things devolved into a massively gropey make-out session on the couch that turned into a lesson in blow jobs in the hallway and ended up with Merlin learning how to properly ride Arthur in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>So, yeah, a fairly successful, and productive, evening overall.</p>\n<p>When it came down to the actual sleeping both of them turned really, tragically awkward. Arthur got up to put his underwear back on, and Merlin dithered over what to wear because he wasn\u2019t going to wear the old saggy plaid pyjama bottoms and worn out Star Wars t-shirt he usually wore to bed, not when Arthur looked like a Greek statue in boxer briefs. The thing Merlin didn\u2019t realize was that Arthur was quite enjoying the view as he stood naked in front of his bureau contemplating his messy drawer of pyjamas and old t-shirts.</p>\n<p>He was nearly at his wits end and almost pulled out the pair of actual pyjamas his mum had given him five Christmases ago that were flannel with little cartoon reindeer all over them when he felt Arthur standing behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking for these?\u201d he asked as he handed over said ratty pyjama bottoms and embarrassing nerd t-shirt. Merlin blushed and grabbed the clothes. \u201cSo,\u201d Arthur continued, looking at the t-shirt Merlin was pulling over his head, \u201cyou made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs too, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shut it,\u201d Merlin said as he stepped into his pyjama bottoms.</p>\n<p>Arthur just laughed and wandered into the bathroom to take a piss. They then proceeded to bumble around about toothbrushes until after having watched Merlin curse and look, unsuccessfully, for a spare toothbrush for a good five minutes Arthur took pity on him and used his finger instead as Merlin sat on the toilet and apologized for his lack of spare toothbrushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you at least buy a new one every couple of months and haven\u2019t had the same one for seven years,\u201d Arthur said after spitting a mouthful of foam into the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cEight years, actually,\u201d Merlin said entirely straight-faced as Arthur gave him a look. \u201cIt\u2019s neon orange, Arthur. <i>Neon orange</i>. How could I possibly give that up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop kissing you from now on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so minty fresh now,\u201d Merlin said as he got up and slipped between Arthur and the sink, \u201cwhy waste that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour logic is flawless.\u201d Arthur laughed and kissed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really stand by your convictions, I see,\u201d Merlin teased as he turned to grab his toothbrush.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just choose to believe in your good sense and the fact that that toothbrush isn\u2019t actually eight years old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou also choose to give in to your complete lack of self-restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur grinned. \u201cYeah, that too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin snorted and went back to brushing his teeth. He watched Arthur wander back into the bedroom and stand helplessly by the side of the bed. He randomly straightened a pillow and gave a tug to the sheets, but just stayed standing there awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI sleep on the right side,\u201d Merlin said around a mouthful of toothpaste. \u201cUm, looking up from the foot of the bed.\u201d Merlin waved his toothbrush at the side closest to the bathroom when Arthur looked over his shoulder at him with a questioning look.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Arthur said as he gave Merlin a small smile and then crawled into bed and scooted over to the left side.</p>\n<p>Merlin finished up and walked into the bedroom. \u201cI can take the left side if you normally sleep on the right, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I usually sleep on the left, so -.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin pulled at the bottom of his t-shirt, twisting it up in his fingers. \u201cSo, I guess that works perfectly then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin twisted his t-shirt up one last time then pulled it down to straighten it out as best he could before taking a big breath and crawling into the bed. He gave Arthur a light smack with the back of his hand when he laughed at him for taking such a deep breath before getting into bed.</p>\n<p>They laid there on their backs just looking at the ceiling until Merlin finally sighed and said, \u201cOkay, how do we do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe just go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want the full cuddle?\u201d Arthur asked, amusement clear in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell when you put it that way -. No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on, Merlin. Let\u2019s have a cuddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Merlin huffed. \u201cLet\u2019s cuddle the hell out of this thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like your determination,\u201d Arthur teased. \u201cYour conviction is giving me a boner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Merlin said as he got up on an elbow and looked down at Arthur, \u201cyou\u2019re incredibly sexy, but then you open your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I get even sexier?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I was envisioning a blow job scenario there with the whole opened mouth business so that\u2019s why I went with the sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin looked at Arthur as he said all of that with a completely straight face and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling at the stupid bugger. Arthur smiled back up at him and asked, \u201cBig spoon or little spoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, little spoon?\u201d Merlin answered quietly as he felt himself flush pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle spoon it is,\u201d Arthur said with total disregard to Merlin\u2019s embarrassment as he moved closer to him and pushed at his arm a bit to get him to roll to his side. Once Merlin did Arthur slipped an arm around his waist and settled in behind him.</p>\n<p>Merlin held himself stiffly as Arthur fitted himself to Merlin\u2019s back; his knees pressing up against the backs of Merlin\u2019s, his front to Merlin\u2019s back, and his cock pressing up against Merlin\u2019s arse. It wasn\u2019t the least bit hard, just warm and so obviously <i>there</i>, but for some reason Merlin thought it a weirdly sweet thing. Arthur seemed a bit vulnerable like that somehow and it made Merlin less uncomfortable himself. He felt his rigidity leave him as his muscles slowly relaxed and he settled back against Arthur.</p>\n<p>When he felt Arthur\u2019s nose against the back of his head, the warmth of his breath on the back of his neck, he reached out and clicked off the bedside lamp. In the darkness he slid his hand down Arthur\u2019s forearm, the one that was solidly wrapped around his waist, and slipped his fingers between Arthur\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>Arthur snuffled a bit and Merlin felt an achingly soft brush of lips against the back of his neck, almost so light as to barely be noticed at all. It was then he felt the heaviness of his eyelids and that dragging weight that always pulled him toward sleep. It was incredibly easy to just let his eyelids drop.</p>\n<p>The last thing he heard was Arthur mumbling in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think your t-shirt is really sexy, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>He was on his back and Arthur was wrapped around him, his head on Merlin\u2019s chest and his arm and leg draped over him as well. Merlin wanted to tease him about being so clingy but there was such an innocence to Arthur in his sleep that Merlin didn\u2019t have the heart to tease him. He just laid there, content to lightly brush his fingers through Arthur\u2019s hair and wait for him to wake up.</p>\n<p>Arthur had set the alarm on his phone the night before and it went off just a few minutes after Merlin woke up. He was disappointed he\u2019d had so little time to lie there with Arthur, but Arthur waking up was equally entertaining.</p>\n<p>Arthur was <i>not</i> a morning person. He was a grumbling, mumbling, cursing sort of person in the morning. He bitched and moaned as he reached behind him to grab his phone on his side of the bed. Once the alarm was off he flopped back over to Merlin\u2019s side and pressed his face down into the center of Merlin\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall in sick to work for me, will you?\u201d Arthur muttered against Merlin\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the boss, who would I call?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno. Elena? She\u2019s seems awfully bossy to me most of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, poor Arthur,\u201d Merlin smiled as he petted Arthur on the head. \u201cI\u2019ll make you some breakfast,\u201d he added as he turned to roll himself off the side of the bed. Arthur groaned in protest when he ended up on the mattress sans Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like my toast burnt,\u201d Arthur said to Merlin\u2019s retreating back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled to himself as he made his way out to his tiny kitchen. He listened to Arthur\u2019s disgruntled mutterings as he got himself out of bed and into Merlin\u2019s shower. Merlin was fairly certain he was mumbling and bitching in there as well.</p>\n<p>When he heard the shower turn off he was just about to pop some bread in and set his toaster to, \u2018the fiery inferno of hell\u2019 to burn Arthur\u2019s toast when he saw the pile of mail he\u2019d abandoned the day before. It was odd that he\u2019d forgotten to take a look at it, usually he obsessively checked his mail for any letters from Lance.</p>\n<p>Lance was a technophobe of the highest order. He hated emails and texting and barely even talked on his mobile when he could find proper reception. Lance was a letter writer, and an amazing one at that. Merlin had stacks of letters carefully saved in his right hand desk drawer, letters that were pages long. The rest of his desk was a disaster area, but that drawer was perfect and tidy in every way as it preserved some of Merlin\u2019s most treasured possessions.</p>\n<p>Arthur found him pouring over his letter when he came out to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA letter from Lance,\u201d Merlin said as he looked up at Arthur with a huge smile. \u201cI got it yesterday. I can\u2019t believe I forgot to check for it. Lance writes the best letters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur dutifully looked at the letter Merlin waved at him. Merlin was too busy getting back to reading the letter to notice how unsure Arthur had become standing there wondering what to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I should go,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWork and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin briefly looked up from the letter. \u201cAnd bossy Elena as well,\u201d he said before going back to his reading.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, her as well,\u201d Arthur said quietly. He stood looking at Merlin for a few more seconds before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later then?\u201d When Merlin didn\u2019t answer right away Arthur said his name.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Merlin asked as he looked up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you later?\u201d Arthur repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah. Sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur made a cursory look around to see that he\u2019d gotten everything he\u2019d come with, sneaking quick glances at Merlin as he did so. When it appeared as if Merlin was lost entirely to his letter he made his way to the front door.</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Merlin,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t very loud, he hadn\u2019t expected a reply anyway, so he wasn\u2019t surprised when none came.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve slept with him now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No! I haven\u2019t. Shut up. How did you know?\u201d Merlin flailed.</p>\n<p>Elena waved at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got sex bliss face. Jesus, Merlin, what did I beg you to do? I was hoping you\u2019d listen to me and not actually sleep with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSex bliss face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the issue here,\u201d Elena said and clapped at him. \u201cFocus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me to stay away,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cBut what you didn\u2019t say was how bloody good he is at sex, because let me tell you, he\u2019s stellar at it. Really gold star work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin! Gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m well on my way to becoming a porn star at this rate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d Elena huffed. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought it up with your sex bliss face nonsense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had to admit he knew exactly what Elena was talking about. Ever since he and Arthur had started having sex he\u2019d been walking around in a sort of daze. He could barely go ten minutes without thinking about Arthur and what Arthur could do to him, or what he could do to Arthur.</p>\n<p>After that first sleepover, and yes, Merlin called them sleepovers because it amused Arthur to no end, Arthur had started sleeping over more and more. At first it was every couple of days, then every other, until suddenly it was every night and Merlin was perfectly fine with that. Arthur had clothes at his place, and his own toothbrush, finally, and they\u2019d figured out how to be with one another. They fucked like rabbits and knew every inch of one another, they knew how to move with each other in the night so they never woke each other up, and they had their morning routine down to a science.</p>\n<p>Merlin had deliberately not gotten together with either Elena or Gwaine for weeks simply because he knew they\u2019d figure it out the second they saw him. He was walking around with the face of a perpetually well-fucked man. It was a wholly new experience for him since he\u2019d spent the first twenty-four years of his life walking around as a perpetually sexually frustrated man.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really digging yourself in deep,\u201d Elena said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really,\u201d Merlin argued. \u201cWe\u2019re just having fun. You know I need to be more normal with guys and Arthur is helping me do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, sweetie, you were perfectly normal as is. Well as normal as anyone else is at any rate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, not more <i>normal</i>, but you know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, but you seem to be talking more about Arthur these days than Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten Lance, Elena, god,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cLike I ever could. He\u2019s the reason I\u2019m doing all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know Lance already loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a <i>friend</i>,\u201d Merlin said bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m always just a mate, a goofy friend, no one ever sees me and thinks anything more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Arthur does?\u201d Elena asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, yes, yes he does,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cHe calls me gorgeous and he looks at me like he <i>wants</i> me and it feels amazing, El. I feel more confident now because of him, I feel more myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elena looked at him and Merlin felt like squirming under her scrutiny.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to harp at me again, just don\u2019t,\u201d Merlin sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m actually going to say good on Arthur. You\u2019re changing, Merlin, and I think for the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, and Arthur is a huge part of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I was possibly a little bit wrong about him. Just a tiny bit though\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, he\u2019s still a manwhore.\u201d Merlin laughed. \u201cHe\u2019d be appalled to know you think he actually possesses a heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t an ass, that still applies.\u201d Elena grinned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Elena rolled her eyes. \u201cHe gets off on me nagging him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Merlin asked. \u201cIt\u2019s so sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Gwaine thinks so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGwaine\u2019s cracked in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is indeed, and he\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin raised himself up on an elbow. \u201cYou have a sister? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk about my family a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d Arthur said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cI just feel stupid because you know everything about me and I babble all the time and here I didn\u2019t know this really important thing about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur reached out and took Merlin\u2019s hand and started playing with his fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about her because she\u2019s always been something in my life I like to keep to myself. I\u2019m selfish about her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy father and I never really got along when he was alive and my mum died when I was eight. She\u2019s been the one constant in my life. The one person who loved me after my mum died. She\u2019s actually my half-sister, but that\u2019s never mattered to me, or to her. She just loves me, as is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin twisted his fingers up with Arthur\u2019s. He never could stop the way his heart clenched in his chest whenever Arthur opened up to him. He so rarely did it. Arthur wasn\u2019t a sharer, he was a listener more often than not, usually to deflect attention from people asking him more personal questions. Merlin found himself wanting to know everything about Arthur, he wanted to dig and dig until he got to the very core of Arthur because he was certain it would be worth it. Merlin knew there was so much more to Arthur than anyone else ever managed to reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get it, wanting to keep her to yourself,\u201d Merlin said, \u201clike a treasure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur smiled at him and leaned in to kiss him, like he was proud of Merlin for figuring it out, for understanding him, and it made Merlin\u2019s insides flip over.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to come to mine tomorrow?\u201d Arthur asked quietly, hesitantly.</p>\n<p>In the three months they\u2019d been sort-of dating Merlin had yet to go to Arthur\u2019s home. He knew it was strange, but because of what they were he never pushed it. He was fine having Arthur at his and Arthur seemed to prefer it so Merlin left it at that. But the way Arthur asked the question it was almost like he expected Merlin to say no, like he wouldn\u2019t want to be where Arthur called home.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, really. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shrugged, but didn\u2019t say anything for a while. Merlin let the quiet stretch on because he knew Arthur would say what he wanted to say eventually, he just sometimes thought too long about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t ask people back to mine,\u201d Arthur said.</p>\n<p>Somehow Merlin had known that. He didn\u2019t say anything about Arthur\u2019s revelation, he just leaned in to kiss him, wanting nothing more than to show him how much it meant to him that he\u2019d made the offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d Merlin said quietly when he pulled away from the kiss.</p>\n<p>Arthur smiled at him, sort of shy and sweet, and told him about the one person that meant the entire world to him. And Merlin took his turn at listening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a really nice place,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as nice as your place though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin looked around at the sweeping expanse of hardwood floors and shiny surfaces that looked like it was straight out of a design magazine and laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me? My place is a dump, who are we kidding?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour place is a home,\u201d Arthur said quietly.</p>\n<p>Merlin looked back over his shoulder at Arthur, saw that he truly meant it, and he supposed it was true in a way. Looking at Arthur\u2019s flat it was all clean lines and really sort of sterile and empty. Merlin thought about Arthur rattling around by himself in such a huge space and it made his heart ache. He walked over to Arthur and reached around behind him so he could gently pull his hands out of his pockets and wrap them around his own waist instead. Arthur smiled a bit then and held Merlin more closely.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, if you equate a filthy mess with home, then yeah, I suppose it\u2019s a home,\u201d Merlin teased quietly as he spoke in Arthur\u2019s ear, his fingers toying with the ends of Arthur\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do excel at making a mess,\u201d Arthur said, and Merlin could hear the smile in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cShow me around?\u201d Merlin asked as he stepped back out of Arthur\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to figure out where the bedroom is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed. \u201cYou read me like an open book, Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur rolled his eyes at him but gave him a quick tour of the flat. Merlin didn\u2019t want to admit he wanted to linger in all the rooms so he could snoop around. Since Arthur barely gave anything away Merlin was hungry for every tidbit about him he could find out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI ordered Chinese, hope that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cShould we do a film?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur nodded and waved over at the shelves that flanked either side of his enormous television. \u201cHave your pick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin scanned the DVDs quickly and saw most of them were action films. He felt like he should give Arthur grief for being such a stereotype, but when he pulled out a DVD and saw there was a row behind the outside one so he started pulling more off the shelf. Merlin smiled to himself when the back row revealed what Arthur had been attempting to hide, although not very well. There were musicals and Disney films and Merlin was pretty sure Arthur owned every Audrey Hepburn film ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite film, Arthur?\u201d Merlin called out to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d came the suspicious reply from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason, just curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou found them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice was getting louder and Merlin knew he was standing in the lounge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite?\u201d Merlin repeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cLion King,\u201d Arthur sighed, his voice resigned.</p>\n<p>\u201cMade my choice then,\u201d Merlin said as he pulled out the DVD.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, we don\u2019t have to watch that.\u201d Arthur walked over to Merlin and tried to snatch the DVD out of his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I want to, I love Lion King.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur didn\u2019t say anything, he just shrugged, but there was a strangeness to his quiet and Merlin wondered if maybe he\u2019d made the wrong choice. He couldn\u2019t understand why though. He watched Arthur go back into the kitchen to get the plates, silverware, and beer he had been in the process of gathering up before Merlin interrupted him.</p>\n<p>When he came back into the lounge he set everything out on the coffee table and silently turned the DVD player on so Merlin could put the disc in it. Arthur fiddled with the remote as Merlin sat down beside him. He chose to sit right next to him, as close as he could, hoping it would make Arthur say something.</p>\n<p>It took sitting through all the bits at the beginning and <i>Circle of Life</i> before Arthur said anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that this is the last film I remember seeing with my mum, she\u2019d sing the songs to me all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin just slipped his arm through Arthur\u2019s and curled his legs up to the side so he could lay his head on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. He felt Arthur start to relax against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d sing to you too, but I\u2019m a terrible singer,\u201d Merlin said quietly after a couple more minutes. He was rewarded with a quiet little burst of laughter from Arthur.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, please don\u2019t, I\u2019d like to preserve the sanctity of the songs, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin gave Arthur\u2019s arm a squeeze and settled back to watch the film.</p>\n<p>The food came a little while later and as they were eating Merlin noticed Arthur was singing along to a song. He knew Arthur was completely unaware he was doing it. He was sitting cross-legged, his plate on his lap, and he was singing <i>Hakuna Matata</i>. He looked utterly ridiculous and sweet and Merlin had to set his plate down because his hands started to shake and his stomach dropped right out of him since it was in that moment, with perfect clarity, that he realized he could love Arthur for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>He could love him. <i>Love</i> him.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Scuse me,\u201d Merlin mumbled. \u201cToilet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was vaguely aware of Arthur looking up at him and nodding okay as he scrambled off the couch and ran to the bathroom. He shut the door behind himself and dropped down to the floor. He felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe, and his hands were still shaking, but the sharp pang of love for Arthur that had shook him apart was still rippling through him. It was violent and all-consuming and he didn\u2019t know how to handle it.</p>\n<p>His love for Lance had been a slow burn. They\u2019d started out as friends and then came the love, at least on Merlin\u2019s end, and it was warm and safe and calm. It was nothing like the shock of love for Arthur he\u2019d just felt. It had come on so suddenly. All he wanted to do was run home, but Arthur had been so worried about asking him over, had given up more of himself that he ever had before and Merlin wasn\u2019t going to make him regret that. He couldn\u2019t do that to Arthur.</p>\n<p>He got up and splashed some water on his face and tried to settle his nerves before going back out to Arthur. He took some deep breaths and hoped he could cover up his massive freak out enough that Arthur wouldn\u2019t notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Arthur asked when he came back out and sat down beside him. \u201cYou sort of made a mad dash there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, had to wee,\u201d Merlin mumbled.</p>\n<p>Arthur laughed and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cIdiot,\u201d he said fondly.</p>\n<p>Merlin had been worried about acting normal around Arthur, but strangely enough the moment Arthur touched him, had kissed his cheek, everything had settled and quieted inside him. And reaching out to touch Arthur back, to lay his hand on Arthur\u2019s thigh, stopped it from shaking.</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled at him. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur leaned into him and went back to watching the film. Merlin took another deep breath and decided he\u2019d let the night happen and he\u2019d deal with everything in the morning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>And there really wasn\u2019t anyone he could talk to about it; Lance and Arthur weren\u2019t options, obviously, and neither was Gwaine since he\u2019d tell Elena immediately, and Elena, well, she\u2019d be Elena about it all.</p>\n<p>It was all so stupid anyway. He couldn\u2019t even do a practice relationship right, how would he ever manage an actual one? He\u2019d gone in with a plan and he had wanted Lance for so long that it all made sense to him. There wasn\u2019t any confusion at all, and Arthur? Well, Arthur had entered into things with the belief that Merlin wanted nothing from him other than practice for something else. And now because Arthur sang some stupid song and Merlin nearly had a heart attack he was stuck wondering if everything he\u2019d ever wanted had just drastically altered itself.</p>\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t like it was wholly surprising, the last few weeks, ever since they\u2019d started sleeping together, Merlin had discovered countless things about Arthur that made him so much more than just practice. More and more Merlin found himself wanting to talk to Arthur first whereas before it was always Lance, when he was still in London, or Elena and Gwaine. Arthur was always on his mind and getting some smartarse text from him was enough to brighten his entire day.</p>\n<p>It made sense, in so many ways, but Merlin had still been bowled over by it.</p>\n<p>He looked at the letter in his hand and realized that there was only a passing desire to tear it open to see what Lance had to say. And what desire was there was more that of a friend than anything else. What he wanted even more was to hear Arthur\u2019s voice, and to crawl into bed beside him and just sleep until everything was magically sorted.</p>\n<p>It was like Arthur read his thoughts because his mobile beeped with a text from him.</p>\n<p>\n<i>going to the market. will make food. i cook. sexy, right?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Merlin laughed as his heart started to pound in his chest at the thought that Arthur would soon be home.</p>\n<p>Home.</p>\n<p>God, he was absolutely fucked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd to get pissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat too.\u201d Arthur laughed. \u201cIt certainly helps with how good you think my cooking is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be delicious,\u201d Merlin said. Arthur was flushed from the hike up five flights of stairs, the lift in the building seemed to be permanently out of order at the moment, and Merlin could hardly look away from him he was so beautiful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you you said that,\u201d Arthur said as he grinned at Merlin over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Merlin just smiled back and sat down at the small table he had crammed into the kitchen so he could watch Arthur chop and mix and stir and make the evening feel absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>Because it was probably going to be one of their last.</p>\n<p>Merlin had read Lance\u2019s letter and the part where he told Merlin he was coming home early, this Saturday to be exact, and that he couldn\u2019t wait to see him. He knew he had to tell Arthur and then that would be the end. The end of shoving at Arthur\u2019s shoulder in the night when he started to snore, the end of fights over what they were going to eat and where they were going to go, the end of being with Arthur and having the freedom to touch him whenever he wanted.</p>\n<p>It was the end of being with Arthur the way he wanted to be with him. As a friend, and, Merlin was willing to admit to himself now, his forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re shockingly quiet tonight.\u201d Arthur had made his way over to Merlin\u2019s side without him realizing it and he jumped a bit at Arthur\u2019s voice. \u201cJumpy too,\u201d he added as he leaned down and kissed the top of Merlin\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Merlin reached out for him, touched his fingers to Arthur\u2019s side, and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just in a quiet mood, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s new,\u201d Arthur teased and Merlin gave him a small smile.</p>\n<p>Merlin tried to act normal the rest of the evening but he knew he wasn\u2019t managing it because Arthur kept giving him odd looks and side-eyeing him. Merlin knew he was being too clingy, touching Arthur every chance he could get, but he couldn\u2019t stop, it was like he was storing up on Arthur, and he couldn\u2019t make himself tone it down.</p>\n<p>When Arthur crawled into bed beside him later that night he turned on his side so he was facing Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s really going on or am I going to have to guess?\u201d Arthur asked.</p>\n<p>Merlin reached out and touched his fingers to Arthur\u2019s mouth. \u201cLance is coming home,\u201d he answered quietly. \u201cThis Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur pulled away from Merlin and scrambled to sit up, his back against the headboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we had more time,\u201d he said, and Merlin thought his voice sounded strange, sort of caught on the words.</p>\n<p>Merlin sat up as well so he could see Arthur\u2019s face better. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be home for another two months. But he said something about a surprise, and it\u2019s his parents\u2019 anniversary, so -.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur didn\u2019t respond, he just sat with his hands in his lap and stared past Merlin. Merlin didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation and all he wanted to do was crawl onto Arthur\u2019s lap and kiss him, so that\u2019s what he did. Arthur\u2019s arms went around him and held him so tightly he could barely catch his breath enough to keep kissing him. Merlin clung to Arthur, his fingers grasped at his shoulders and back, and it all felt a little desperate and rushed but Arthur didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>Arthur set one hand on the mattress next to them and used it as an anchor to lift Merlin up and onto his back as he kept his other arm wrapped tightly around his waist. Merlin hooked his legs around Arthur to keep him as close as possible as they continued to kiss.</p>\n<p>Merlin felt Arthur\u2019s cock against his thigh as he rolled his hips against him and Merlin started to push Arthur\u2019s underwear past his hips. Arthur was working at Merlin\u2019s own with one hand as he kept a hold of Merlin with the other. They managed to scramble out of their pants and when Merlin reached for a condom Arthur stopped him with a hand to his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me?\u201d he asked, his voice low and quiet and his eyes never leaving Merlin\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded. \u201cYe -,\u201d he started but couldn\u2019t get the rest of the word out so he took a breath and closed his eyes and tried again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur took Merlin\u2019s face in his hands as he kissed him with an all consuming earnestness that made Merlin shake. When Arthur pulled away from the kiss he moved onto his back beside Merlin and simply looked at him. He didn\u2019t say a word, and neither could Merlin, but Merlin made himself move because he wanted Arthur so badly then that he could barely wait to be inside him.</p>\n<p>Being on the other side of things was exciting and fucking scary as hell and Merlin knew, he <i>knew</i>, he\u2019d do something wrong but Arthur\u2019s eyes were steady on him and he felt like he could do it as long as Arthur didn\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>Merlin had been between Arthur\u2019s thighs before, many times, he\u2019d done things between those thighs that made him blush when he thought about them too much. It was only when he was with Arthur that he felt unashamed, alive, and he was here with him now and that\u2019s all he needed to settle his nerves and to do try to give Arthur as much pleasure as he\u2019d given him.</p>\n<p>Merlin wanted to laugh out loud, joyous and obnoxiously smug, when Arthur writhed beneath him and pushed back against his fingers, silent but begging. Merlin felt a delirious kind of power in making that happen, in pushing inside Arthur and rocking with him, fucking into him and making him gasp and claw at the sheets beneath him. He was the one stroking Arthur, bringing him off, and the moment overwhelmed him. With Arthur\u2019s come all over his hand, he hooked his arms under Arthur\u2019s knees and fucked into him, wanting to draw out the moment forever and at the same time never stop coming.</p>\n<p>Arthur was still panting beneath him, his face red with it, and Merlin lost all focus but to find Arthur\u2019s mouth with his own. He nearly folded Arthur in two as he leaned down into him to kiss him, but Arthur stayed with him. He grasped at Merlin\u2019s shoulders to pull him down closer as they kissed. Arthur was all around him, sweaty limbs, gorgeous mouth, and tight heat, and Merlin wanted to hold on forever but it was impossible to stop the coil of heat rushing through him. And in the end it was Arthur there beneath him, stroking his cheek and whispering his name in his ear over and over again.</p>\n<p>It was the only time he ever felt that word meant something.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>And the dinner, god, the dinner. It was awkward and over too soon and not soon enough. Merlin had wanted to run away from the uncomfortable silences mixed with questions from Arthur about Lance and what Merlin would do now that he was days away from getting what he\u2019d wanted so badly. But he\u2019d also wanted to stay at that little tucked away table and sit across from Arthur for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>It had been a miserable evening.</p>\n<p>At the end of dinner they were standing on the pavement waiting for a cab. Arthur was standing with his hands shoved into his pockets staring out at the road in front of them, and Merlin was staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still stay mates, yeah?\u201d Merlin asked, praying his voice didn\u2019t sound as pathetically hopeful to Arthur as it did to his own ears.</p>\n<p>Arthur glanced over at him and quickly away again. \u201cYeah, of course. Of course we will.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u2018of course\u2019 sounded like \u2018I doubt it\u2019 and Merlin kind of wanted to sit down on the ground and cry.</p>\n<p>When a cab came close Arthur flagged it down and opened up the door for Merlin to get in.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s yours,\u201d Merlin said. \u201cI\u2019m taking the tube.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cMy treat. I want you to get home safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Arthur</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get in, okay Merlin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, a\u2019right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin got into the cab and Arthur followed to give the driver his address and to hand over what Merlin knew was way more money than was needed to get him home. He reached out and brushed his fingers over the soft wool of Arthur\u2019s jacket, a fleeting touch he was sure Arthur didn\u2019t feel.</p>\n<p>Merlin clenched his fingers into fists and held them in his lap when Arthur started to draw back out the door. Merlin had to look away out the opposite window, he couldn\u2019t stand looking at Arthur leaving. He thought he was just about in the clear when he sensed Arthur hesitating and moving back into the cab. Before he knew it he was wrapped up in Arthur\u2019s arms as he knelt at Merlin\u2019s feet. Merlin gasped and found his arms moving around Arthur to hold him right back.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe happy, Merlin,\u201d Arthur whispered in his ear and just like that he was out of his arms and gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Merlin said breathlessly, but it was too late, Arthur had already shut the door.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>He was still excited to have Lance back, thrilled, really, but it wasn\u2019t the same kind of thrumming excitement he\u2019d felt before Arthur. Before Arthur Lance was all he thought about, he was his goal, his future, and now that place inside him belonged to Arthur.</p>\n<p>When the day of Lance\u2019s return actually did arrive and he was at the welcome home party he\u2019d had to make a run for the toilet to press his hand over his mouth to stifle the hysterical laughter that was bubbling up inside him when Lance had showed him his \u2018surprise\u2019 and introduced him to his beautiful fiancee, Gwen.</p>\n<p>Of course. <i>Of course</i>.</p>\n<p>Merlin had to laugh otherwise he\u2019d burst into tears at the whole fucked up situation.</p>\n<p>Logically he\u2019d known it was a possibility for Lance to find someone, he\u2019d been away for over a year, but Merlin had held onto such a stupid, pathetic hope that he\u2019d come home and finally <i>see</i> Merlin the way he wanted him to that he\u2019d pushed reality aside and now here he was, in love with someone who wasn\u2019t interested in love and the person he\u2019d done it all for engaged to someone else.</p>\n<p>He had gathered himself up, controlled his hysterical laughter, and had gone back out to make nice with Gwen and to welcome Lance back properly. She had been more than lovely and Lance had seemed so incredibly happy that Merlin felt a little bit calmer by the end of the evening.</p>\n<p>When he was getting ready to leave Lance had come to give him a hug goodbye. As he\u2019d held Merlin in one of his massive Lance hugs he\u2019d whispered in Merlin\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin pulled back so he could look at Lance and answered, \u201cNothing, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Lance had smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Merlin said, and Lance had given him a kiss on the cheek and sent him on his way.</p>\n<p>Merlin knew he\u2019d only tell Lance part of the story, he didn\u2019t want him to feel badly about it, and Lance would if he ever found out what Merlin had felt for him. But for the time being Merlin wanted to wallow, and try to figure out what to do without Arthur.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>He groaned and got out of bed when it seemed like the knocking wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, El, go away,\u201d Merlin said as he got to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not El,\u201d an unfamiliar voice said.</p>\n<p>Merlin hesitated for a moment but opened the door. Standing on the other side was the woman he\u2019d seen in what few pictures Arthur had in his flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded. \u201cMorgana, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>She gave him a small smile and a nod. \u201cCould I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Merlin said as he stepped aside.</p>\n<p>Morgana walked past him and then came to a stop in his lounge. She turned to look at Merlin and smiled at him again. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be adorable,\u201d she said and Merlin could feel himself blush.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks?\u201d Merlin didn\u2019t mean for it to sound like a question but he didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Merlin shrugged. \u201cDo you want tea, coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Morgana said. \u201cI know I\u2019m intruding so I want to say what I came to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Merlin said hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came here because of Arthur, obviously,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten bits and pieces of what went on between the two of you and I know you want to be with someone else, but I wanted to ask a favor of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had no idea what Morgana could possibly want from him but if it was for Arthur he would do whatever she asked of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cof course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur mentioned something about staying friends, or staying in touch, but I\u2019m asking you not to do that. I\u2019m asking you to stay out of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin was shocked by her request. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything against you,\u201d she was quick to say, \u201cit\u2019s for Arthur that I\u2019m asking this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019d be good for him right now to be around you. I don\u2019t know, maybe after a while,\u201d Morgana said, \u201cbut not now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why can\u2019t I see him?\u201d Merlin knew he sounded sort of desperate but the panic that had settled in at the thought of not seeing Arthur was too much to handle.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, my brother doesn\u2019t love easily and it breaks my heart because he has such a capacity for it, but his father did a number on him and left behind a man who finds it really difficult to trust other people and to get close. This is already hard enough for him, I don\u2019t want him to have to go through anything that he doesn\u2019t have to, and seeing you would just about kill him right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin had to sit down on his coffee table, it was the nearest thing to him, because he couldn\u2019t quite trust his legs to hold him up. He looked up at Morgana and saw she was giving him a strange look.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Merlin said, \u201che has such a great capacity for love, his heart -. He has such a good heart but he doesn\u2019t let anyone see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morgana sat down on the chair across from him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know, did you?\u201d her voice was resigned.</p>\n<p>Merlin shook his head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t because my brother is an emotional cripple. Oh, fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s heart was racing in his chest and he had to hold onto his knees to keep his hands from shaking. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay,\u201d he told Morgana, \u201cit is, because now I know. I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knew he probably sounded a bit manic, but he was just so damn happy.</p>\n<p>Morgana was apparently master of the stare down because Merlin was nearly squirming under her scrutiny. \u201cYou love him too, don\u2019t you?\u201d she finally asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d Merlin gasped somewhere between laughter and a sob, the whole situation was so messed up, but it was going to get better, so much better. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Morgana said as she stood up. \u201cI thought you -. But what about Lance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s engaged,\u201d Merlin laughed, because now he could. \u201cTo someone obviously not me. But it didn\u2019t matter, because there was Arthur and it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d Merlin knew he was babbling like an idiot but he didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell for fucksake go take a shower, because you stink to high heaven, and then get your cute little backside over to my brother\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin lifted his arm and took a sniff. \u201cI do,\u201d he laughed again, \u201cI fucking reek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell don\u2019t be <i>proud</i> of it,\u201d Morgana rolled her eyes, \u201cgo get yourself together. I\u2019ll head back over to Arthur\u2019s and get my husband and kids out of there and he\u2019ll be all yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour husband and kids?\u201d Merlin said inanely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and god only knows what they\u2019ve done to him while I\u2019ve been gone. Like he wasn\u2019t in a state already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin saw Morgana to the door and just before she left she turned to pull him into a stranglehold of a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cHe was drowning, Merlin, fucking drowning and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Merlin said, \u201cI\u2019ve got him now.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>~*~</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Arthur said, and god, there was so much in that one word. Merlin just watched Arthur\u2019s face and saw surprise and wariness and a deep happiness underneath it all and Merlin knew that happiness was for him, that it belonged him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust get out of the shower?\u201d Merlin asked as he stepped past Arthur and walked into his flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, my sister is staying with me and she threw a fit about me having a shower before she rushed her entire family out the door.\u201d Arthur shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t even ask anymore, I just do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWise choice,\u201d Merlin nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s a bossy thing, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looked like he was about to agree but then he stopped himself and said instead, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Arthur took a step back from Merlin. \u201cShe went to see you, didn\u2019t she? Shit. Shit shit shit. I told her to mind her own damn business but she can never manage to do anything you ask her to and I\u2019m sorry, Merlin, I\u2019m so sorry. She shouldn\u2019t have bothered you, you didn\u2019t need to know -.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur was babbling and it was adorable, Merlin had never seen it happen before. He took a step toward Arthur, and then another one until he was close enough to take Arthur\u2019s face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Arthur whispered brokenly as he wrapped his fingers around Merlin\u2019s wrists and half heartedly tried to pull them away, \u201cplease don\u2019t. I can\u2019t -.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI needed to know,\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>Arthur shook his head. \u201cYou have Lance and your plan, you didn\u2019t need to know I couldn\u2019t hold up my end of the bargain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin touched his thumb to Arthur\u2019s bottom lip. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold up my end of the bargain either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looked up at him, confusion in his eyes, but a spark of hope behind it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stick to the plan either. I guess we\u2019re both fucking pants at planning.\u201d</p>\n<p>A small gust of laughter escaped from Arthur\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a good thing though,\u201d Merlin continued, \u201cworked out quite nicely, I\u2019d say. It\u2019s always a good thing when the person you love loves you back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Arthur breathed and let his forehead drop against Merlin\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t -, what about Lance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting married, apparently,\u201d Merlin smiled at Arthur, \u201cguess I really missed the boat on that one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really are the worst kind of idiot, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Arthur\u2019s voice was gaining volume and solidity and Merlin laughed with happiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d Merlin said cheerfully.</p>\n<p>Merlin felt the tentative touch of Arthur\u2019s fingers on his hips and he stepped closer to him hoping he\u2019d tighten his hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, I -.\u201d Arthur stopped himself and Merlin could have shaken him, he knew Arthur still wasn\u2019t sure and he needed to see that he was.</p>\n<p>Merlin leaned in to press his mouth close to Arthur\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s fingers dug into his hips, to a nearly painful degree, but Merlin didn\u2019t care because it meant Arthur was there beside him. Merlin could hear Arthur\u2019s labored breaths and feel them against his shoulder, but he waited and gave Arthur time to get to where he needed to be, just like he always did. Careful Arthur, god, how he loved him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said finally.</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled at him and wrapped his arms around Arthur\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAgainst your better judgment, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he teased, trying to pull the intensity out of the moment, but Arthur was having none of it.</p>\n<p>Arthur shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re the best judgment, Merlin, the best. That first night I saw you, I wasn\u2019t going to say yes to your stupid plan, but then I did. I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d Arthur looked at him, touched his fingers to the side of Merlin\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re the best judgment,\u201d he repeated.</p>\n<p>It hardly made any sense, what Arthur said, but it made perfect sense to Merlin and he couldn\u2019t imagine being happier than he was in that moment. He slid a hand up to Arthur\u2019s neck to hold him in place as he kissed him because it was all he wanted and because he <i>could</i>.</p>\n<p>He could kiss Arthur forever.</p>\n<p>Merlin walked Arthur over to the couch and pushed him down, and he followed, his legs straddling Arthur\u2019s as he sat in his lap.</p>\n<p>Arthur pulled back from the kiss suddenly and smiled up at Merlin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a smug bastard about this to Elena, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Merlin said as he flopped his hands up in the air then let them drop to Arthur\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain being able to rub it in her face was one of the main reasons I fell in love with you in the first place and made you love me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky for you I obliged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Merlin said quietly, his fingers tracing Arthur\u2019s lips, \u201clucky me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~end</p>"
