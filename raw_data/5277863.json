  "text": "<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung draws his oversized sweater a little closer to his body. The weather is colder than he\u2019d expected, temperatures dropping quickly now that the sun has set and the campus is engulfed in darkness. Or it would have been if there wasn\u2019t a lamp post every two feet. Campus security is no joke.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His nose already feels frosty and his fingers are beginning to follow suit, so he buries them deeper in the yellow sleeves. Jimin likes to say that the colour reminds him of stale mustard but Taehyung refuses to acknowledge that the garment looks anything other than sunshine yellow. His best friend had solemnly shaken his head and said,\u00a0<em>\u2018I can\u2019t believe you manage to get laid looking like that,\u2019</em>\u00a0as Taehyung had exited their dorm room earlier.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin knows what Taehyung\u2019s objective is for the evening. He knows Taehyung is meeting up with someone to destress after midterms, and essays, and endless experiments with lab equipment that seems to be designed solely for the purpose of thwarting all his scientific ambitions. His best friend knows it\u2019s someone who can get Taehyung down on his knees, begging for more. That much Taehyung had divulged over cheap drinks and anime. Jimin just doesn\u2019t know who this person is. It wasn\u2019t like Taehyung had explicitly lied about Jeongguk; he just hadn\u2019t been very forthcoming about his identity either, leaving Jimin to assume it\u2019s someone he doesn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung prefers to think of it as creative story telling.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Pushing thoughts about the moral ambiguity of his actions to the back of his mind, Taehyung turns a corner and the artificial lightning begins to thin out. He still doesn\u2019t know how Jeongguk can afford to live in an apartment by himself just off campus. The situation does nothing but feed into all the bad rumours that are going around about him and his penchant for body decoration doesn\u2019t help with that either.\u00a0The girl with the big eyes and loose lips sitting in the back of one of Taehyung\u2019s microbiology classes had once let it slip that Jeongguk was said to be part of a gang. Another had whispered he\u2019d send a man to the hospital once. Taehyung himself suspects that Jeongguk is a stereotypical rich brat with a chip on his shoulder, trying to rebel against the status quo, nowhere near as dangerous as the stories depict him to be. But that\u2019s just a guess. They don\u2019t talk about things like that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Despite the nature of their relationship, most of Taehyung\u2019s information concerning Jeongguk is second-hand. Most of it actually comes from Jimin. Jeongguk and Jimin are members of the same dance team and the bad boy has been the bane of Jimin\u2019s existence ever since he joined. Jeongguk has perfected his irreverent teasing of Taehyung\u2019s best friend to a level that can only be described as art. It\u2019s the reason Taehyung hadn\u2019t told Jimin about his meetings with Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s probably the reason they were happening in the first place.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As Taehyung walks down the street, his destination now only a few buildings away, he thinks about the first time he\u2019d talked to Jeongguk. He\u2019d been to enough showcases and listened to enough of Jimin\u2019s exasperated rants to recognize him when Jeongguk approached him in a bar off campus.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung should have probably turned him down but (with alcohol in his system and the vision of a young god in front of him) the words had come out like a flirtatious invite instead,\u00a0<em>\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to talk to you. I heard you\u2019re the devil\u2019s spawn.\u2019</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If Jeongguk had been surprised by Taehyung's statement, he hadn't shown it. He\u2019d merely flashed him a smirk that Taehyung has become all too familiar with over the past weeks.\u00a0<em>\u2018I see my reputation proceeds me. Who\u2019s been spreading the gospel of Jeon Jeongguk?\u2019</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung had found himself returning Jeongguk\u2019s grin.\u00a0<em>\u2018Jimin. Your wicked ways are all he ever talks about.\u2019</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That was the first time Jeongguk\u2019s laughter ringed in his ear and Taehyung had known instantly that it would be so difficult to stay away from him. Jeongguk\u2019s demeanour had been perfectly in sync with Taehyung\u2019s; the game of push-and-pull played out so perfectly between them. When Jeongguk\u2019s warm hands slipped under his shirt at the end of the evening as his tongue conquered Taehyung\u2019s mouth, Taehyung no longer had the will power to resist.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That\u2019d been the first evening Taehyung had gone home with Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By now the door in front of him is almost as familiar as his own. Taehyung raps his knuckles on the wood in rapid succession, eager to get out of the cold and against Jeongguk\u2019s body.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It seems like forever before the door opens and Jeongguk leans against the doorpost in all his broad-shouldered glory. Dressed in just his sweatpants, Taehyung can admire the wide planes of his chest and the strong curves of the muscles in his arms, covered with intricate swirls and foreign lettering. Taehyung assumes the tattoos are all supposed to have a deeper meaning but, who knows, maybe they're just misspelled song lyrics instead. Still, the sight never fails to create heat in his abdomen.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk smirks knowingly; a seductive curl of the lips that\u2019s both arrogant and alluring. Jimin calls it the devil\u2019s smile and it does look sinfully good on him in Taehyung\u2019s humble opinion. But the smirk has to part for words to pass through, \u201cno scarf and sunglasses this time?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI swear someone was watching me that time. Following me.\u201d Taehyung doesn\u2019t wait for a spoken invitation but squeezes in past Jeongguk. \u201cYou know Jimin would kill me if he found out.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The door falls close behind them, shutting out the cold. \u201cWho would ever want to spy you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou would,\u201d Taehyung teases. \u201cYou positively worship my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk scoffs, \u201cI don\u2019t have to spy on you. You\u2019re always coming to me first, so who\u2019s worshiping who exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung decides an argument about who of them is thirsting for it the most is a waste of precious time, so he shoots Jeongguk a playful wink instead. \u201cI think we all know I\u2019m your dick\u2019s most devout follower.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk's face lights up a little at that comment and the threat of a petty argument is successfully avoided. Taehyung turns to toe out of his shoes but he can still tell Jeongguk is coming up behind him before he's even wrapped an arm around his waist.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Strong hands push aside the fabric of Taehyung\u2019s sweater without hesitation, the touch already deliciously demanding, as Jeongguk\u2019s hot breath tickles the sensitive skin of his neck. Taehyung has only been inside for a few minutes but he can already feel himself growing hard. The effect Jeongguk always has on his body borders on downright petrifying.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pulls him against his chest, Taehyung\u2019s ass lining up perfectly with his crotch, and it becomes clear that Taehyung isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s excited. Soft lips tease the crook of Taehyung\u2019s shoulder followed by a soft bite and soothing swipe of a\u00a0tongue. It is sure to leave a mark and Taehyung knows it\u2019s merely the first of many.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The knowledge sends a shudder down Taehyung\u2019s spine and his body begins to burn, the outside cold already a distant memory.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI think I might need you to prove your devotion to my dick,\u00a0<em>baby</em>,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs right below his ear. Taehyung can\u2019t stop his breath from hitching when Jeongguk sucks the lobe into his mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He knows Jeongguk is deliberate in his use of the word\u00a0<em>baby</em>\u00a0as a pet name.\u00a0 Jeongguk uses it because he gets off on the fact that Taehyung is older but pliant under his forceful touch. He uses it because he\u2019s an insolent brat just like Jimin always says he is. Taehyung can\u2019t help but find it amusing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnything for you, Gukkie,\u201d Taehyung promises in breathy tones; an obvious lie but it doesn\u2019t fail at making Jeongguk groan and rock his hips into him with a blatant eagerness.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Impatient, Jeongguk turns Taehyung in his grip so he can collide their lips together. There\u2019s an almost frantic hunger in the way Jeongguk kisses him, a desperate need in how his hands roughly clutch at Taehyung\u2019s waist to direct him towards the bedroom. It makes Taehyung feel weak in the best possible way. He suspects it makes Jeongguk feel strong and in control.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Breaking their kiss to come up for air, Jeongguk makes quick work of the sweater, muttering something about it being\u00a0<em>\u2018hideous\u2019</em>\u00a0under his breath. Taehyung takes offense to that and nips on Jeongguk's bottom lip. The hands on Taehyung\u2019s ass tighten briefly in retribution, the sensation just south of painful. \u201cPlay nice,\u00a0<em>baby</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOr what?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s teasing challenge makes Jeongguk\u2019s eyes grow even darker. This is a dangerous game he\u2019s playing, Taehyung knows that, but he\u2019d always felt things were most exciting when the stakes were high. The dangerous games are the fun ones. He takes in the tattoos he loves to run his fingers across, the piercings he always aches to tug at with his teeth, the lean muscles that can hold him with so much strength. Jeongguk is trouble. Taehyung likes trouble a bit more than he probably should.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With a growl, Jeongguk pulls off Taehyung\u2019s remaining shirt, leaving them both naked from the waist up. He then meshes their lips together again with enough conviction to make Taehyung believe he never plans on separating them ever again. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk tastes sweet, intoxicating. It\u2019s like a drink Taehyung can never get enough of. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s become so addicted in merely a few weeks. Trouble. Jeongguk is trouble. He\u2019s trouble in the way he skilfully seizes control of Taehyung\u2019s mouth, leaving Taehyung panting for more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Even with their lips locked, they manage to find their way through the apartment and into Jeongguk\u2019s bedroom, hands constantly groping at naked flesh. Taehyung revels in the way he can feel Jeongguk\u2019s muscles flex beneath his skin. He feels so good to the touch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s fingers start fiddling with Taehyung\u2019s belt but he groans in frustration when it won\u2019t give. Patience is never Jeongguk\u2019s strong suit during their hook-ups. At least not during the first round. Taehyung snickers but takes pity on him, his long fingers travelling downwards to undo it himself. When he\u2019s finished, Jeongguk slips his hand in without hesitation and wraps it around Taehyung\u2019s dick. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so hard already.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gasps when Jeongguk starts tugging experimentally, a calloused thumb teasing at the slit before moving downwards, pre-come facilitating the glide. Taehyung mouths at Jeongguk\u2019s jaw as Jeongguk works him, moving lower and down Jeongguk\u2019s neck, biting his shoulder when Jeongguk flicks his wrist in just the right way. With one hand, Taehyung palms Jeongguk\u2019s dick through the fabric of his sweatpants. \u201cCould say the same about you, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gives Jeongguk a teasing squeeze as if to prove his point and is rewarded with a guttural groan. The heat in Taehyung\u2019s belly intensifies. He sinks to his knees, taking Jeongguk\u2019s sweatpants with him, determined to prove his devotion like Jeongguk had requested earlier. Jeongguk\u2019s dick looks like it\u2019s dying for affection, just like Taehyung imagines his own does.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Normally, Taehyung might try and tease Jeongguk a little more, he does love to torment him, but tonight the need to taste Jeongguk is too strong. He briefly kisses the tattoo on Jeongguk\u2019s hipbone after which he takes him between his lips with a wink. He gives the head a quick suck and smoothly swallows Jeongguk deeper, savouring Jeongguk's taste on his tongue. It\u2019s slightly salty and bitter but at the same time sweet and irresistible.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung knows a lot of people hate it but he loves sucking dick. He might be the one on his knees but the gorgeous man in front of him is the one at Taehyung\u2019s mercy. He can tell by the way Jeongguk\u2019s hips buck and his dick twitches in his mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One hand on Jeongguk\u2019s hip and the other at the base of his dick, Taehyung settles into a slow rhythm. He watches Jeongguk as he drags his tongue across a sensitive vein and seeing the pleasure on Jeongguk's face is so utterly gratifying. But Taehyung only has the chance to do it two times before he can feel Jeongguk\u2019s fingers twist in his hair, pulling him off. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNot like this.\u201d Jeongguk nods towards the bed. Taehyung\u2019s insides tighten with unbridled want.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Discarding the last of his clothes, Taehyung makes his way over and Jeongguk is quick to follow his good example. The state of the bed is not unexpected but it still amuses Taehyung. A bottle of lube and a few unopened condom wrappers are strewn across the duvet, obviously thrown on there without care.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung crawls onto the bed with a chuckle, settling on his shins. \u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic, Jeonggukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAt least I bring condoms to the party \u2014\u201d Taehyung opens his mouth to protest but Jeongguk knows better than to give him the time to do so \u201c\u2014 Condoms that aren\u2019t\u00a0<em>Glow in the Dark</em>\u00a0or<em>\u00a0Banana Flavoured</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As Jeongguk settles on the bed behind him, Taehyung picks up one of the packages for closer inspection. \u201c<em>Ultra Thin Feel</em>. How uninspired.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut I like them, baby.\u201d Jeongguk wraps two possessive arms across his waist and pulls him closer until Taehyung\u2019s back sits flush against his chest. It causes Jeongguk\u2019s dick to settle between the cheeks of his ass, still wet with his saliva, and Taehyung can\u2019t help but roll his hips back into it. The grip on his waist tightens. \u201cI like how they let me feel every ridge of you when I fuck into you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The way the dirty words are breathed near his ear makes Taehyung shiver. Desire starts to coil in his stomach, the heat from before blazing back to life. Suddenly, Taehyung is no longer interested in looking at the condoms, he wants to start using them already. \u201cWhen you put it like that, it does sound nice.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk hums in agreement and reaches around him for the lube. When the bottle cap snaps open, Taehyung experiences an almost visceral response; a tremor shaking his body in anticipation. It only gets worse as Jeongguk\u2019s finger begins to tease his entrance and it doesn\u2019t stop until the digit slides in easily, meeting almost no resistance. Taehyung immediately rocks back on it. He\u2019s so hungry for it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck,\u201d Jeongguk curses in a coarse voice. \u201cWhat have you been getting up to before you came over?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A second finger joins the first one, making Taehyung keen. \u201cI-I got impatient, so I gave myself a head start.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t say is how Jeongguk had been on his mind the entire time Taehyung finger-fucked himself in the shower earlier that evening.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk groans behind him. The digits curl and twist expertly, causing white hot sparks to flicker up Taehyung\u2019s nerve endings. \u201cHow did it feel when you were touching yourself? Did it feel good,\u00a0<em>baby</em>? Did it feel like this?\u201d There's an almost jealous edge to Jeongguk\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung confesses with a moan. \u201cYou feel better. So-so much better.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grunts in approval, appeased by the idea of outdoing Taehyung\u2019s own fingers. If Jeongguk wasn\u2019t tormenting his body with sharp stabs of pleasure, Taehyung might have laughed at his competitiveness. With the situation being as it is, he releases a series of desperate moans instead.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk begins to place to soft bites and wet kisses along Taehyung\u2019s shoulders and neck as he works him open. Taehyung knows he\u2019ll probably be covered in them by the time the night is through because, for some reason, Jeongguk is never satisfied until Taehyung looks like his personal work of art. Taehyung reaches one arm over his head to clutch at Jeongguk\u2019s hair, silently asking for more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk moves one arm around him to start stroking Taehyung\u2019s dick again, using a hand Taehyung suspects he'd been touching himself with just seconds earlier. Distracting Taehyung with his tugging, Jeongguk slips a third finger in. It stings in the most delicious manner. Movements faltering for only a second, Taehyung\u2019s body readily accepts that digit as well.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung knows he could come like this,\u00a0<em>would</em>\u00a0come like this very soon if they didn\u2019t stop, but he doesn\u2019t want it this way. Jeongguk\u2019s hand and fingers are not enough. Taehyung craves more. He tightens his grip on Jeongguk\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Gukkie. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s all the encouragement Jeongguk needs. His hands still their administrations, the loss making Taehyung whimper, and move to Taehuyng\u2019s back, pushing him down towards the mattress until Taehyung is on his hands and knees. Jeongguk doesn\u2019t ask if it\u2019s okay like this, they're past that point. After several weeks, Jeongguk knows how Taehyung likes it. Except there\u2019s a softness behind the forceful touch that Taehyung rather not think about.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The sound of a plastic wrapper being torn open is there to distract him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t turn to look but he knows when Jeongguk is rolling on the condom. He knows when Jeongguk lubes himself up. He can tell by all the little sounds that escape Jeongguk\u2019s mouth as he\u2019s touching himself. Those sounds haunt Taehyung in his dreams. He thinks about them all the time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pushes in with a swift but steady thrust and the stretch his dick provides makes white spots flash behind Taehyung\u2019s closed eyelids. Taehyung almost sobs with how good it feels. The sensation never disappoints. Jeongguk never disappoints. Even as Jeongguk is still for a moment, giving Taehyung time to adjust, Taehyung\u2019s body seems to buzz with pleasure and he immediately pushes back, trying to take Jeongguk deeper.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck, you take it so well, baby.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s strained praise is like music and Taehyung wants to hear more. He needs to hear more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They settle into a rhythm, Jeongguk\u2019s hands caressing his sides, pulling him closer every time he pushes in. Taehyung eagerly obliges by rolling his hips back to meet his every stroke. All the while, Jeongguk keeps singing his appreciation in soft murmurs, \u201cYou look so good like that, baby. So pretty. So fucking good.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It takes just a few thrusts before Jeongguk finds his prostrate and Taehyung keens while letting his head drop down onto the pillow to let him know just that. Jeongguk doesn\u2019t miss the hint and makes sure every next push hits Taehyung exactly where he needs it the most. Jeongguk can touch him so deep like this, fucks him so well from behind. The waves of heated pleasure are rolling over Taehyung; he just wishes there were more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFaster.\u201d Taehyung can hardly recognize his own voice, cracked and splintered with lust.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk groans in response and his fingers grip Taehyung\u2019s hips in a vice-like clutch, leaving even more marks. Marks Taehyung treasures.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The bucking of Jeongguk\u2019s hips builds up, the plunging of his dick in Taehyung\u2019s body almost punishing. Like Taehyung had wanted, the waves of pleasure increase in number. He\u2019s beginning to drown in what Jeongguk is doing to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s only Jeongguk and the sounds they\u2019re making and his sweat slicked skin against Taehyung\u2019s body as they move together. The bed cracks and protests under Jeongguk\u2019s forceful thrusts but Taehyung loves the obscene sounds. The coil of heat and want and ecstasy in his stomach just keeps constricting further and Taehyung knows he\u2019s so close. He can already feel his toes curl in bliss.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk must have sensed as much. \u201cAre you going to come, baby?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung chokes out between hoarse cries.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk stills suddenly, a hand moving to squeeze around Taehyung\u2019s dick. \u201cNot yet. Not until I say so.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels a familiar mixture of emotions take hold of him. A part of Taehyung hates Jeongguk for denying him his orgasm but a larger part of him loves the delayed gratification Jeongguk is subjecting him to. But then Jeongguk completely slips out of his body and Taehyung\u2019s scale of emotions immediately tips in favour of strong dislike.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Jeongguk.</em>\u201d The neediness is unmistakable. It\u2019s a desperate plea disguised as a name.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGet on your back.\u201d But before the words finish leaving Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, he\u2019s already succeeded in turning Taehyung over.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk makes sure to lock their eyes together as he slides back in Taehyung\u2019s body. Trouble. Jeongguk is trouble. The obsidian eyes are like magnets; Taehyung can\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The new position provides a whole new level of intimacy. A level Taehyung isn\u2019t quite sure he can take but when Jeongguk\u2019s mouth is upon his own, those thought disappear like they were never there to begin with. Taehyung obligingly wraps his legs around Jeongguk\u2019s waist as they settle into a slower rhythm than before. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jeongguk still pushes so deep inside his body. Still fucks him so well even like this. Taehyung clutches at Jeongguk\u2019s hair as the waves of heat are back, rakes his nails across Jeongguk\u2019s tattooed back as Jeongguk moves within him like he\u2019s robbing Taehyung of everything he has. Jeongguk is trying to steal something with his kisses. Something precious; Taehyung just knows he is.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Before Taehyung can determine what he's lost to Jeongguk, the coil in his abdomen bursts and his orgasm finally hits him. It makes Taehyung\u2019s head roll back against the pillow, his eyes rolling back even further, whimpers he didn\u2019t even know he could make filling the air.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jeongguk only stills for a minute, Taehyung\u2019s climax so strong he can\u2019t move for a short while, and picks up his pace again. The sensation of Jeongguk fucking into him is so intense when Taehyung is still riding the aftershocks of his release. It\u2019s too much. Taehyung deeply regrets not sucking Jeongguk off for longer. He weakly pushes on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders, knowing it\u2019s futile. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t do this to me, Gukkie. You can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like he'd been waiting for Taehyung\u2019s desperate pleas, Jeongguk\u2019s hips begin to stutter and falter, finally reaching his orgasm as well. Taehyung\u2019s body is wrecked with a quiver when Jeongguk groans in his ear as he comes, another when Jeongguk swells inside of him, and a final one when Jeongguk ultimately slips out of his body.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung immediately misses Jeongguk\u2019s weight when he rolls off him. He feels he should say something, something to burst the bubble. He settles on a sighed, \u201cyour dick has wrecked me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can practically see Jeongguk\u2019s chest swell with pride upon hearing his praise and grins a sly smile he doesn\u2019t let Jeongguk see. Bad boys and their easily inflatable egos.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a while, the only sounds between them is their breathing returning to normal. The blood rushing in his ears is replaced by a wonderful mellow feeling. Suddenly, Taehyung\u2019s midterm stress and essays and lab experiments seem like things that never even happened. He isn\u2019t sure if he even remembers what he\u2019s majoring in at the moment. Biology something.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eventually, Jeongguk gets up to dispose of the condom and to fetch them a towel. He helps clean up the mess on Taehyung\u2019s stomach when Taehyung still feels a bit too hazed and blissed out to move. After unceremoniously dumping the towel on the floor, the laundry basket standing merely three feet away, Jeongguk is back at his side.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung vaguely registers Jeongguk starting to play with his hair. The sensation is far too pleasant. If he isn\u2019t careful, it might lull him to sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDid everything work out okay with that lab project you had to do?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s question catches him off guard, Taehyung didn\u2019t expect Jeongguk would remember something he\u2019d once merely mentioned in passing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt turned out okay in the end.\u201d Taehyung trails the outline of the tattoo on Jeongguk\u2019s hipbone with a single finger. It\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s favourite one because whenever he licks it, Jeongguk goes mad. \u201cThe Professor says he is going to deduct some points, though.\u201d His finger reaches the lowest line of inked skin and the muscles in Jeongguk\u2019s abdomen contract in the most mouth-watering way. \u201cBecause he caught me roasting squid jerky over a Bunsen burner one evening. Apparently I\u2019m not allowed to use the university\u2019s equipment in such a disrespectful manner.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk snorts rather un-sexily upon hearing that confession. His bad boy persona cracks and evolves into something else; something bordering on cute and adorable. It reminds Taehyung vaguely of a bunny and suddenly Jeongguk looks his age. Moments like these don\u2019t feed into burning in the lower pit of Taehyung\u2019s stomach but hit Taehyung higher. They make his heart thump violently in his chest. Jeongguk is trouble. Trouble indeed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It scares Taehyung more than he would like to admit. \u201cI should go and get back to my dorm before the temperature outside drops below cold as fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk watches him get up and pull on the clothes they\u2019d left all over the bedroom floor. He looks unfazed by Taehyung\u2019s abrupt departure but it\u2019s not like shouldn\u2019t be used to it by now. Shimming into his sweatpants, Jeongguk follows Taehyung out into the hallway. \u201cMaybe you could stand the cold a little better if you'd put on a proper coat instead of that mustard monstrosity.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung huffs as he pulls the garment in question up off the floor and over his head. \u201cI look like an adorable ray of sunshine in this sweater and don\u2019t you even try to deny it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As they make their way to the door, Jeongguk laughs in a way that shows he clearly disagrees with that statement.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung turns to toe back into his shoes, he feels something soft being draped around his shoulders. The scent of Jeongguk\u2019s cologne invades Taehyung\u2019s nostrils as his fingers toy with the new addition to his outfit. It\u2019s like a punch to the gut. Taehyung\u2019s questioning eyes flicker from the red scarf to Jeongguk\u2019s face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s an old one. You can bring it back next time.\u201d Jeongguk looks almost as surprised by his actions as Taehyung is.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The unexpected moment of care is followed by an awkward silence. Taehyung is about to make a silly remark to try and salvage the situation but Jeongguk beats him to it, \u201cSay hi to Jimin for me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou know I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHmm, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m your dirty little secret.\u201d Jeongguk smirks but Taehyung can\u2019t tell how sincere it is. On the surface it looks like he enjoys being someone\u2019s dirty secret just as much as Taehyung pretends he likes to keep them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung decides to make an effort for his best friend and raises an eyebrow. \u201cNow that we are on the subject of Jimin, stop being a cocky brat and start calling him hyung. He\u2019s older than you and if I have to listen to him complain about you one more time, I\u2019ll probably go crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk easily dismisses Taehyung\u2019s instructions with a wave of the hand. \u201cWhat would be the fun in that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung figures he\u2019d hereby tried and failed. Jeongguk would continue acting however he pleased and Jimin would have to deal with that problem on his own.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just like Taehyung had invited himself in, he lets himself out by opening the door and stepping outside. Jeongguk leans against the doorpost and the entire situation is laughably similar to earlier in the evening. Except Jeongguk\u2019s lips look a little swollen and his hair is messy from where Taehyung clutched at it and Taehyung assumes he looks similarly dishevelled.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The bunny that Taehyung had caught a glimpse of in the bedroom is long gone. At the moment, Jeongguk looks every bit the bad boy enigma but Taehyung can still feel his heart beating in erratic patterns.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cText me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSure,\u201d Jeongguk drawls with studied nonchalance, almost tipping over into indifference, but Taehyung knows he will. Jeongguk always texts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung supresses the urge to press a goodbye kiss against Jeongguk\u2019s lips and settles for a casual wave. When he turns and takes his first few steps towards home, he can hear Jeongguk\u2019s apartment door closing behind him. The sound is unexplainably unpleasant.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung digs his nose into the scarf. More of Jeongguk\u2019s scent fills his nose, familiar and capable of inducing an immediate tightening in his gut. Taehyung sighs. Deep down he knows he\u2019s making a big mess of things and it would probably prove to be toxic in the long run.\u00a0Sometimes, when it\u2019s two in the morning and Taehyung still can\u2019t sleep, he wonders if he\u2019s using Jimin\u2019s dislike of Jeongguk as an excuse. It\u2019s easy to pretend something isn\u2019t real if nobody knows about it. If you don\u2019t tell anyone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As the lamp posts around him increase in density, Taehyung resolves to finally spill the beans this time. To tell Jimin what has been going on and to see where that revelation will take him and Jeongguk. Just like he had the last time he came back from Jeongguk\u2019s apartment in the dead of the night. And the time before that one.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Maybe this time he finally would.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung never did tell Jimin. But he isn\u2019t sure if he ever\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0thought he would.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk did text him. It took him a longer time than usual to reach out and the location specified was unexpected but Jeongguk did text. Jeongguk always texts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The light above Taehyung\u2019s head begins to flicker, casting the hallway he\u2019s walking down in an eerie glow. It probably does that during the day as well but now that it is almost midnight, the shaky illumination seems ominous. Taehyung always finds it exciting to be in one of the university\u2019s buildings at night when it\u2019s mostly empty. It feels illicit even at the times it isn\u2019t, just like meeting up with Jeongguk does.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung turns the final corner and spots his destination. He could probably find his way to the dance studio in his sleep, Jimin had dragged him there to watch often enough, but recently he hadn\u2019t visited any of the dance practices. Not since Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s the first time that Jeongguk has texted to meet him there after practice. When Taehyung had asked why, Jeongguk had send him one of his trademark succinct responses:\u00a0<em>floor-to-ceiling mirrors.\u00a0</em>After that, Taehyung didn\u2019t need any more convincing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The music coming from the inside makes Taehyung pause, one hand on the door handle. If Jeongguk is still practicing, it would mean he\u2019s been at it for hours; first group practice and now on his own. That\u2019s a lot of dedication for a bad boy who pretends not to give a fuck. Turning the handle as quietly as possible, Taehyung squeezes in unnoticed, locking the door behind him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The sight of Jeongguk dancing is like a blow to the chest, taking all of Taehyung\u2019s breath away. His moves are sharp, measured, angry. It\u2019s not the same as watching Hoseok, Jimin or any of the other dancers. Watching Hoseok dance makes Taehyung happy, watching Jimin dance makes him proud. Watching Jeongguk dance just makes him burn. The way Jeongguk\u2019s hair is stuck to his forehead, the way his skin shimmers under the artificial lightning, the way his tank top has grown damp, everything about him makes Taehyung burn. Jeongguk is trouble. So much trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The graceful movements of Jeongguk\u2019s limbs falter when he finally spots Taehyung in the mirror. He dances until the chorus ends before making his way to the stereo, muting the music and grabbing his water bottle. There\u2019s something very enticing about the thirsty manner in which Jeongguk downs the drink. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung starts to move away from the door, closing the distance, leaving his coat behind in a heap on the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk eyes him suspiciously. \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cLong enough. Is that for the next showcase?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shakes his head. \u201cFreestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk casually bobs his shoulders as Taehyung reaches him, like he\u2019s already well aware that he\u2019s good and doesn\u2019t need Taehyung to confirm it for him. Up close Jeongguk looks even better. At this moment, he embodies everything Taehyung supposedly hates; exercise and sweat, yet he still makes Taehyung burn.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t seem to return the sentiment, nose scrunching up in distaste. \u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing this time?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung looks down at his clothes; sweatpants like the one Jeongguk\u2019s wearing, a customised baggy sweater, and socks in sandals. It\u2019s his staple outfit on his off days. Sometimes on his normal days too. \u201cThey're my comfy clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThey\u2019ve got holes in them.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know. I put them there myself.\u201d Taehyung flashes him one of his signature boxy smiles. He knows how to play cute. \u201cIt\u2019s artistic.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk groans. \u201cI swear you looked hot once. You were looking so fuckable when I picked you up at the bar that one time.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWhere did things go wrong for you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s not about what\u2019s on the outside, Gukkie. It\u2019s about what\u2019s underneath.\u201d Taehyung can see Jeongguk roll his eyes at the platitude.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not the least bit discouraged, Taehyung presses up against him, finding his lips. Despite his obvious dislike of Taehyung\u2019s clothes, Jeongguk\u2019s response is instant, one arm wrapping around Taehyung\u2019s waist as the hand on his other arm finds the nape of Taehyung\u2019s neck. There\u2019s desire and hunger on Jeongguk\u2019s tongue as he explores Taehyung\u2019s mouth. Jeongguk is always hungry. The kiss tastes salty, wet, but still sweet. In his current state, Jeongguk shouldn\u2019t still taste so good.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is the one to pull away first, tilting his head playfully. \u201cAnd in my case that would be nothing, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s face lights up, interest piqued. He moves his hands down, fingers slipping under the waistband of Taehyung\u2019s baggy sweats, and discovers Taehyung is speaking the truth. He gives the naked globes of Taehyung\u2019s ass a slight pinch as he pulls Taehyung even closer. \u201cUgly or not, it does make for easy access.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grins. \u201cI knew you\u2019d like it in the end.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk smirks and it\u2019s conceited but inviting at the same time. Taehyung can\u2019t help but burn. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes dart to the door. \u201cDid you lock it?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pulls back to yank his tank top over his head, dumping it on the floor, and then his mouth is upon Taehyung\u2019s again. He doesn\u2019t kiss Taehyung like he\u2019s been dancing for hours, there\u2019s a fire behind it that makes Taehyung think Jeongguk could kiss him long enough to last until morning, but he feels and smells like he\u2019s been dancing. Jeongguk\u2019s skin is slippery under Taehyung\u2019s fingers as he clutches at Jeongguk's broad shoulders, his scent is heavy as it enters Taehyung\u2019s nose. Taehyung shouldn\u2019t like it so much but he does. Trouble indeed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk cups his jaw, forcing him to look up. \u201cDid you bring it?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Taehyung presses their lips together for another hungry kiss. \u201cI brought it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung digs into the pocket of his sweatpants and dumps the content in Jeongguk\u2019s outstretched hand. Jeongguk looks at the lube and condoms with a mixed expression. His small sigh hints at exasperation but the twitching at the corner of his mouth indicates amusement as well. \u201cThey\u2019re red.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOf course they are, I got to pick, so I got us something fun for a change\u2014\u201d Jeongguk scoffs but Taehyung doesn\u2019t let that deter him \u201c\u2014and why wouldn\u2019t you like it? It\u2019s your favourite colour, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung falls silent when he realises what he just said. Jeongguk raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s all you ever wear.\u201d Taehyung shrugs his shoulders, feeling defensive although he isn\u2019t exactly sure why. \u201cBlack, white, every shade of grey that comes in between, and red. Yet you have the balls to complain about my wardrobe.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t talk, his black eyes boring into Taehyung\u2019s, searching. It feels like such a long time. Then he shrugs, tension gone. \u201cKetchup beats mustard.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It takes two whole seconds before the words sink in and Taehyung\u2019s frame begins to shake with giggles. They sound hoarse in his deep voice. \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t know your condiments. Mustard and ketchup go hand in hand.\u201d Taehyung gives Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder a weak push. \u201cAnd stop insulting my sweaters, you little brat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grins as he slips the condoms into his own pocket. A strong touch backs Taehyung up against the mirrored wall, the show of force causing delectable shivers to travel down Taehyung\u2019s spine. \u201cShut up. They\u2019re hideous and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Before Taehyung has the chance to protest, Jeongguk glues himself to Taehyung like a second skin, his muscular thigh sliding between Taehyung\u2019s legs, the friction making Taehyung moan into his mouth. The hands on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder move upwards over his arms, pinning them to the mirror, as Jeongguk\u2019s lips move lower across Taehyung\u2019s jawline and neck. Jeongguk nips at the skin, placing new marks over faded ones. The rings and bracelet on Taehyung\u2019s hands tick dangerously on the reflective surface behind him but it\u2019s hard to worry about scratching the mirror when Jeongguk is rocking between his legs. All Taehyung can do is rock back. They\u2019re so hard already.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks up. \u201cDid you touch yourself again?\u201d His eyes are dark. \u201cBefore coming over?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels his cheeks heat up. It\u2019s become a ritual of sorts. He touches himself before meeting up with Jeongguk and he touches himself again after. It makes the time spent with Jeongguk seem longer. It prolongs the pleasure.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk can read the answer on his face and groans. \u201cFuck, you drive me crazy sometimes.\u201d He releases his grip on Taehyung\u2019s wrists. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t even hesitate. The mirror feels cool and calming under his palms but the face staring back at him looks almost foreign. His cheeks are already flushed, the redness travelling downwards until it disappears under his sweater, accented by the love bites Jeongguk left behind seconds earlier. He feels Jeongguk\u2019s hands slip under the waistband of his sweatpants before he sees them pool around his feet in the reflection before him. His mirror image\u2019s modesty is preserved by his oversized sweater, blocking Jeongguk\u2019s hands and their effect on Taehyung\u2019s body from view. Taehyung wonders if the sweater will ever come off this evening. The idea it might not it only adds to the heat pooling in stomach.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A slicked finger teases at Taehyung\u2019s entrance. It slips inside without further warning, making Taehyung moan and drop his head. Jeongguk\u2019s breath is hot as it skims across Taehyung\u2019s sensitive neck and Jeongguk\u2019s voice is gravelly as he whispers in his ear, \u201cTell me what you think about when you do it,\u00a0<em>baby</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A second digit joins the first, locating his bundle of nerves, making Taehyung whimper as they work him open. Taehyung moves back on them with unashamed eagerness. The fingers of Jeongguk\u2019s free hand entwine themselves with the strands of Taehyung\u2019s hair, forcing him to look up. Taehyung meets Jeongguk\u2019s eyes in the mirror. The dark orbs are no less captivating when seen in a reflection; they\u2019re still on fire and Taehyung still can\u2019t look away and they still make him burn. He\u2019s burning up so badly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk curls his fingers, grazing his prostate. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind when you touch yourself? Who do you see?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cY-your fingers. Your cock. W-what you\u2019ll do to me\u2014\u201d Taehyung keens as Jeongguk\u2019s third finger pushes in with the others, momentarily unable to continue, eyes scrunching shut in the pain-laced pleasure \u201c\u2014<em>You</em>. Just you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can sense Jeongguk\u2019s satisfaction in the way his touch changes, fingers becoming tender. Now there\u2019s extra care behind the forcefulness, less demand in Jeongguk\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk finally tears his gaze away to place a soft kiss on Taehyung\u2019s bare shoulder, the overly large sweater pushed off to the side. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods. \u201cReady.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the mirror Taehyung can see Jeongguk\u2019s hand disappearing to pull a condom out of his pocket. He can see Jeongguk\u2019s sweat pants fall to the ground as he simultaneously tears open the wrapper between his teeth. Taehyung knows that isn\u2019t safe but it still makes his gut clench with aching want. He can see the pleasure etched in Jeongguk\u2019s features as he rolls the condom on behind Taehyung\u2019s back and lubes himself up, the actual motions hidden from view but clear as day on Jeongguk\u2019s face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s eyes are upon him again as he pushes inside Taehyung. It\u2019s too much, Taehyung\u2019s eyelids flutter close as Jeongguk bottoms out with a groan. Jeongguk\u2019s dick burns in the most delicious way, adding fuel to the fire already blazing in Taehyung\u2019s stomach and Taehyung rocks back on him in desperation, needing more. Wanting more. \u201c<em>Move</em>, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. He pulls out, the sensation of him leaving Taehyung\u2019s body just as gratifying as when he enters, and pushes back in with a string of expletives falling from his lips. Jeongguk\u2019s hands move under Taehyung\u2019s sweater with determination, gripping Taehyung\u2019s hips with purpose, before settling in a hard rhythm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung braces himself against the mirror, meeting each of Jeongguk\u2019s thrusts. The hands on his hips adjust the angle of his body and Jeongguk\u2019s next stab hits his prostate. Taehyung\u2019s forehead falls towards the mirror with a whimper as the flames of pleasure lick at him. He burns.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Jeongguk croaks in lust-filled tones. \u201cLike that, baby. Take it like that.\u201d He\u2019s merciless as always, giving Taehyung\u2019s sweet spot no respite after he\u2019s found it.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s something dirty about their sweatpants pooled around their feet, the fabric of Taehyung\u2019s sweater shifting with their motions. Every thrust of Jeongguk\u2019s dick makes Taehyung grow hotter, his hands now slippery on the glass. But Taehyung is panting on the mirror, fogging up the reflective surface. He can\u2019t see Jeongguk like this. He wants to see Jeongguk. He <em>needs</em> to. \u201cI-I want to ride you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grunts. \u201cThese floors aren\u2019t exactly comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Gukkie</em>,\u201d Taehyung pleads in breathy tones, trying to squeeze as much neediness in the name as he can. He knows it has the desired effect when Jeongguk\u2019s rhythm falters. \u201cLet me ride you, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pulls out, causing them both to groan like they\u2019re in pain. The aching emptiness Jeongguk\u2019s dick leaves behind makes Taehyung briefly think he\u2019s made a mistake. But that feeling disappears when Jeongguk tosses a towel on the floor and sits down, leaning back on one hand. Taehyung follows him to the ground after taking off his sandals and sweatpants. He leaves the sweater on.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Swinging his leg over Jeongguk\u2019s lap, Taehyung positions himself above Jeongguk\u2019s dick. It\u2019s his turn to look at Jeongguk as he sinks down, slowly taking him inside his body. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes hood over in pleasure, a moan escaping his lips. \u201cFuck, baby, you feel so good.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung starts rolling his hips. \u201cYou too. So, so good.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s free hand grips at Taehyung\u2019s ass, helping him move. The way the fingers dig in the skin, Taehyung knows he\u2019ll have a reminder of this night every time he sits down on a hard surface in the coming days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They can\u2019t move as fast as when they were standing and it\u2019s back again; the intimacy. Taehyung\u2019s chest clenches painfully at the sight of Jeongguk\u2019s face, so he doesn\u2019t look. He doesn't want to see it after all. His eyes travel lower and his hands follow, trailing his fingers over the tattoo under Jeongguk\u2019s collarbone. Even lower still, across the tattoo on Jeongguk\u2019s side. Taehyung does ponder the meaning of them a lot. Jeongguk\u2019s abdomen flexes involuntarily and Taehyung swallows. Sometimes looking at Jeongguk hurts. He can make Taehyung burn so hot. Trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung kisses him as they fuck, each thrust stocking the fire higher, eager to steal back whatever Jeongguk stole from him the last time they met. As they kiss, the heat in his stomach keeps increasing, their movements growing frantic. Taehyung is so close; he can feel it. Jeongguk is too, Taehyung can tell by how Jeongguk\u2019s rhythm is starting to disintegrate right beneath him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung kisses harder, trying to take everything from Jeongguk just like Jeongguk always takes all he has from him. Before Taehyung can be sure if he\u2019s succeeded, Jeongguk swells within him, climaxing underneath him. They break apart in moans as Taehyung rides him through his orgasm, milking him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Surprise overtakes Taehyung when Jeongguk still has the clarity of mind to push aside the sweater and wrap a hand around Taehyung\u2019s dick, helping him find ecstasy as well. It only takes a few strokes before Taehyung is finally consumed by the fire eating away at him. He sobs Jeongguk\u2019s name as he shoots his release on Jeongguk\u2019s abdomen and hand, marking him like Jeongguk always marks Taehyung\u2019s skin with his teeth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It takes a while before the fever resides and Taehyung\u2019s mind becomes clear again. Jeongguk is waiting for him, one hand rubbing slow circles on Taehyung\u2019s sweat-slicked back, looking pleased with himself. \u201cYou with me?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung smiles faintly, once again amused by Jeongguk's blatant smugness. Then he nods, moving off Jeongguk\u2019s dick as he holds the condom in place at the base, his body trembling at the final graze over his now raw nerves. \u201cYour dick should come with a warning label.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk chuckles, ego stroked, but it turns into a groan as he pulls the towel out from underneath his butt. He uses it to clean up the mess on his hand and stomach. \u201cYou fucking owe me for sitting on this floor. I can\u2019t feel my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grins and leans forward to place a peck on Jeongguk\u2019s nose. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think I know of a couple of ways to make it up to you. I\u2019ll have your ass feeling happy in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk stares back with wide eyes and Taehyung can feel a blush creep up his cheeks. Things are strangely reversed in a hook-up scenario. It\u2019s not the sex but the innocent gestures that are taboo. They aren\u2019t supposed to give each other fluttery kisses on the nose.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Rattling from the door handle acutely cuts through the awkwardness. Taehyung\u2019s heart skips a beat before trying to burst out of his chest, and they both tense up with surprise.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk is the first to relax. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s locked from the inside. They\u2019ll need a key to get in but I stayed last. I have it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods weakly, heart still racing, as he completely moves off Jeongguk\u2019s body. But then there are more scraping noises coming from the door; the sound of someone fiddling with a lock and key.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck,\u201d Jeongguk hisses as he gets up off the floor and shimmies into the sweatpants still wrapped around his ankles, stuffing the used condom in one of the pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s Hoseok.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung frantically reaches for his own sweats. \u201cI thought you said\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0have the key.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019s the fucking captain.\u201d Jeongguk furiously rubs at his bare stomach, trying to remove all evidence of Taehyung. \u201cHe has his\u00a0<em>own\u00a0</em>key.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung barely manages to wiggle into his sweat pants before the door swings open but he already knows it doesn\u2019t make a difference if they\u2019re naked or not.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJeongguk, you still\u2014\u201d Hoseok\u2019s question dies on his lips as he spots them. His eyes flicker from Taehyung to Jeongguk and back again. Then he sighs. \u201cJimin is going to be so pissed.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk spares Taehyung a brief glance after which he scoffs and starts picking up his stuff from the dance floor. \u201cAs opposed to a time when he isn\u2019t acting butthurt.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s butthurt,\u201d Hoseok says, making his way to a bench on the side of the wall, collecting a stray book. Taehyung winces. Of all the times Hoseok could have accidently left that behind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok looks at them with a perfectly on point expression of a disappointed mother. \u201cThe dance studio, guys, I mean\u2014<em>really?</em>\u201d His face contorts in pain. \u201cWe occasionally eat off that floor, Jeongguk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grabs his gym bag and stuffs his tank top and towel inside. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you never have, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok opens his mouth in a silent gasp of horror.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shrugs, pulling a hoodie out of his bag and over his head. \u201cYour loss then.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung watches Jeongguk swing the bag strap across his chest and step towards the exit. He waves a casual hand over his shoulder as he passes through the doorway, not bothering to look back. Taehyung wonders if Jeongguk won't be cold without a coat. He has to supress the urge to tell Jeongguk to stop.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The air grows thick after Jeongguk\u2019s departure. Taehyung feels itchy and dirty, his sweater drenched in his sweat, maybe Jeongguk\u2019s too, the inside of his pants sticky. The smell of sex is heavy around him. The smell of Jeongguk is still there while he himself isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok\u2019s eyes shift from the door through which Jeongguk just left to the spot where Taehyung is still rooted to the ground. The orbs are not as playful as they usually are. Somehow serious looks carry more weight when coming from someone as cheerful as Hoseok. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung briefly considers lying but doesn\u2019t. \u201cA few weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok whistles, his eyebrows raised. \u201cI bet that amounts to a lot of fucking.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It does. Taehyung is quiet for a few seconds, before opening his mouth to give way to an unsure voice, \u201c<em>Hyung?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to tell Jimin.\u201d It\u2019s more of a statement than a question. Taehyung nods hesitantly and Hoseok clucks his tongue. \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s college.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok fixes him with a stare. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any less real, Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d The words taste like a lie.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Okay</em>,\u201d Hoseok says, but his voice lilts in a way that expresses scepticism. \u201cReady to go?\u201d He jiggles the keys. \u201cI need to lock this place up before I leave.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods and slips into his sandals before trudging towards the door and his coat. Something shiny catches his attention as he passes the stereo; Jeongguk\u2019s phone. He pockets it without thinking.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung and Hoseok are silent on their way outside but they\u2019re not supposed to be. They\u2019re the rowdiest of their group of friends and the silence between them sounds foreign. It\u2019s almost a relief when they part ways at the main entrance.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As Taehyung walks back to the dorm alone, he thinks about Jeongguk. Something has changed, Taehyung just doesn\u2019t know what exactly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But he knows he can\u2019t take it back.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung knows he can\u2019t change what happened in the dance studio. He can't change the fact Hoseok caught them in the act.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He also knows he needs to give Jeongguk back his phone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung eyes the device on his desk. He shouldn\u2019t have taken it with him. If he had given it to Hoseok instead, it wouldn\u2019t be on top of his study papers right now, he wouldn\u2019t be staring at it intermittently for the past half hour instead of preparing for his afternoon lecture. During the last class discussion, Taehyung had been useless because the night before he\u2019d been binge watching\u00a0<em>Attack on Titan</em>\u00a0with Jimin. If he doesn\u2019t read up on the latest research on Serotonin Inhibitors, he\u2019s bound to firmly cement his reputation as the resident airhead of the class. He\u2019d rather have someone else wear that dubious badge of honour. Taehyung sighs. Senior year\u2019s a bitch. According to Hoseok, being a graduate student is even worse.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung idly fidgets with his pen when he should be taking notes with it instead.\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>\u00a0is still staring back at him from his desk and Taehyung can feel the corners of his lips tug up in a faint smile. Jeongguk\u2019s superhero phone case doesn\u2019t match all that well with his tattoos and piercings.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Spinning his desk chair round and round, Taehyung rhythmically thumbs the top of his pen, the clicking noise becoming faster as his self-control grows weaker.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Slapping his hand down on top of the desk, Taehyung comes to an abrupt stop. One look.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung picks up the phone and opens the menu. Jeongguk still doesn\u2019t use a passcode. Taehyung had expected Jeongguk would have put one in after what happened last time. His thumb hovers over the message icon but Taehyung bypasses it; he wouldn\u2019t go that far. It\u2019s also not the reason why he\u2019s been fixated on the phone ever since he remembered he took it home with him last night.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung opens Jeongguk\u2019s pictures instead. He scrolls through them, most of the pictures are of notes from Jeongguk\u2019s classes, a few of some people Taehyung doesn\u2019t know (or at least not personally), some of Jeongguk\u2019s and Jimin\u2019s dance team. When his own face pops up, he stops. They\u2019re still there.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung had gotten his hands on this phone once before, when Jeongguk was taking a shower. That time, he\u2019d taken over twenty pictures of his own face to keep himself entertained (each one sillier than the one before) and to mess with Jeongguk\u2019s head. It had worked a little too well. Jeongguk had been furious.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At the time, Taehyung had been sure that his silly joke meant the end of their casual hook-ups. It had taken him a considerable amount of acting cute and no less than two blowjobs to calm Jeongguk down and work his way back into Jeongguk\u2019s good graces.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk had said he would delete the pictures but he hadn\u2019t. Taehyung bites his bottom lip. He wonders what Jeongguk\u2019s reason was for keeping them. Or if maybe Jeongguk had just forgotten they were there.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s an inexplicable urge to add more pictures of his face to Jeongguk\u2019s phone but Taehyung resists the impulse. No amount of blowjobs would make Jeongguk forgive him if he made the same mistake twice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is staring at a picture of himself sticking out his tongue while holding his fingers up in a V-sign, when the door swings open with considerable force. Taehyung flinches in his chair, almost dropping the phone to the floor, his hands scrambling to save it from an untimely end or cracked screen. Jeongguk would kill him. When the phone is secure in his grip, he quickly stuffs it in his backpack.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin whines like a dying animal as he tumbles into the room and down onto his bed. Taehyung waits for him to speak but his best friend doesn\u2019t, instead pulling a pillow over his head to stifle his screams.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung raises an eyebrow. He\u2019s usually the one in charge of the theatrics, not Jimin. \u201cYou okay there, ChimChim?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin pulls the pillow up off his head and narrows his eyes in an accusing manner. \u201cWhy did you let me take\u00a0<em>Environmental Chemistry and Physics</em>? You just stood by and watched me do it. How could you, Tae?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The pen finds its way back to Taehyung\u2019s hand and he resumes his clicking from before. \u201cYou needed the science credits. This course fit your schedule the best.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin groans. \u201cYou should have stopped me. You\u2019re horrible. I hereby de-friend you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin just sighs; loudly and full of anguish.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, ChimChim.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Another sigh.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll help you with the sciency bits.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A disbelieving groan this time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gets up from his chair and drops down beside Jimin on the small bed. He proceeds to wrap himself around his friend like an overgrown koala. \u201cCan\u2019t be all bad.\u201d He tucks his chin on Jimin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs the Professor at least nice to look at?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAverage,\u201d Jimin breathes while staring at the ceiling. He\u2019s quiet for a few second before continuing, \u201cBut there\u2019s this Teaching Assistant.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grins. \u201cIs he hot?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin sighs again but this time it\u2019s with longing instead of desperation. \u201cI want to lick every inch of his skin. Repeatedly.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung chuckles, his arms tightening their grip briefly in amusement. Jimin is wonderfully solid and sturdy in his arms; his rock. Taehyung tickles his side. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s all there is. I wanna lick him.\u201d\u00a0Jimin giggles as he turns to look at Taehyung, eyes scrunched into crescents. \u201cLike every day.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Jimin smiles, Taehyung smiles too. It\u2019s infectious. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a bad class at all. I\u2019m coming to your next lecture. I want to meet the human popsicle.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin\u2019s giggles deteriorate into cackles. \u201cI want to lick the popsicle\u2019s popsicle.\u201d That statement really isn\u2019t all that funny. Their jokes often aren\u2019t but they usually still succeed in making each other laugh until they cry.\u00a0Jimin is still wheezing when he turns to his side. \u201cDon\u2019t you have class in a few minutes, TaeTae?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung glances at the clock on the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s still time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin snuggles closer. \u201cYou want to go out to eat tonight? Like, get something bad and greasy?\u201d\u00a0They hadn\u2019t done that in a while, Jimin had been on a diet.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung smiles his boxy smile. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re free? You\u2019re not meeting up with your mysterious boy toy tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s smile falters. \u201cNo, I just saw him last night. It\u2019s just a hook-up. I don\u2019t want to overdo it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin hums, eyes sharp. \u201cYou\u2019ve been meeting up with him for a while, though. You\u2019re usually not that committed. What\u2019s so special about this one?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s opening; it\u2019s right there, all he has to do is take it. Taehyung has been waiting for a chance to confess to Jimin about Jeongguk and now Jimin is presenting him the perfect opportunity on a silver platter.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Taehyung still doesn\u2019t take it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHis dick. It\u2019s like\u2014\u201d Taehyung waves his hand in the air in a crude gesture hinting at size \u201c\u2014ten out of ten would totally fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t stay away just because of his massive dick?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\" Taehyung says with a sigh. \"I think it\u2019s put a spell on me. It calls my name at night.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\"Because that\u2019s not creepy at all.\" Jimin gives Taehyung an inquisitive look. \"What about the man attached to it, though? He put a spell on you too?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung shrugs, the motion stunted when lying down. \u201cHe\u2019s hard to read. We let his dick do most of the talking.\u201d Jimin looks unconvinced. Hurt maybe, because Taehyung won\u2019t share more. Taehyung unwraps his arms and gets up from the bed before he says something stupid. Like Jeongguk\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go, ChimChim. I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSee you tonight, Tae.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung makes it to the class room with five minutes to spare. Class goes as expected considering he had done none of the reading but all of the procrastination. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t the only one and he isn\u2019t half-bad at bullshitting his way through the discussion. He only gets one or two strange looks when he speaks, both of them from the Professor. Taehyung isn't sure if he's already completely forgiven for the squid jerky and Bunsen burner incident. But the girl with the ugly green sweater is fairing far worse, answering all her questions poorly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s still a relief when the class is finally over.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung gets outside, he digs his nose deeper into Jeongguk\u2019s scarf. It still faintly smells of Jeongguk\u2019s cologne but it gets weaker each day. Taehyung should give that back as well. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s nicer than the scarf he owns himself, warmer, and the days just keep getting colder. There will be snow soon. Taehyung loves snow but he hates the cold.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The university's buildings thin out until they completely disappear as Taehyung steps across an invisible threshold and off campus. It feels strange walking towards Jeongguk\u2019s apartment during the day when the sun is out, like Taehyung\u2019s timing is off. They usually meet up at Jeongguk\u2019s place after dark. Things are different at night; priorities shift, emotions change. People aren\u2019t the same at night, when the darkness shrouds their activities.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Knocking on Jeongguk\u2019s front door feels different too because for the first time in weeks, Taehyung isn\u2019t sure how their meeting will play out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk opens the door fully dressed and with a beanie on his head. Another deviation from their normal pattern; Jeongguk usually greets him half-naked and with a smirk, not this guarded expression. But then Jeongguk usually knows when he\u2019s coming.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTaehyung?\u201d The name rolls off Jeongguk's lips in curt tones.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung puts his arm out,\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>\u00a0staring up at them from the palm of his hand. \u201cYou forgot your phone last night.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk takes the device and checks it. He doesn't question why Taehyung is the one who had it. Taehyung sees Jeongguk's thumb hovering over several icons but he ultimately doesn\u2019t tap them, pocketing the phone instead. His eyes shift their attention back to Taehyung. They\u2019re like the rest of him; cold and uninviting. His entire posture looks stiff and unyielding. \u201cI take it we\u2019re over.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk furrows his eyebrows in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m your dirty little secret, right? You didn\u2019t want Jimin to know. Well, you saw Hoseok hyung last night. I think that ship has sailed.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung slowly shakes his head. \u201cHoseok hyung won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One of Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrows lifts up in disbelieve. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBecause he said he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a few heartbeats, Jeongguk is silent. Then he releases a mocking huff. \u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice sounds small even in his own ears.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s jaw clenches and unclenches. One of his hand reaches up to brusquely adjust his beanie. \u201cPeople lie, Taehyung. Everyone does. You\u2019re lying to your best friend, aren\u2019t you? What more proof do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s lips thin out in a terse line. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. I lie to my best friend. You lie to your teammate on the dance squad. We all lie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The following silence could cut glass. Jeongguk opens his mouth to speak but a gravelly voice from inside the apartment pipes up before he has the chance, the vowels and consonants rolling like the owner might have had one or two drinks, \u201cJeongguk, you little shit, are you fucking coming to help me with this or what?!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can\u2019t think of a face that matches the unfamiliar sounds. Jeongguk turns his head to yell back over his shoulder, \u201cIn a minute, hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWho the fuck are you even talking to, Jeongguk?\u201d The voice appears to be coming closer. \u201cIs it one of those idiotic bible thumpers?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The owner of the drunk voice appears in view, seizing Taehyung up. He doesn\u2019t look intoxicated up close and Taehyung thinks he's definitely seen him around campus before. The pink hair is hard to miss. Another man with tattoos and piercings just like Jeongguk; someone also at the centre of the university\u2019s rumour mill. He looks just as intimidating at first glance as Jeongguk does, if not more, even though he's shorter than both of them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The pink-haired man nods in Taehyung\u2019s direction. \u201cHey.\u201d He turns towards Jeongguk before Taehyung can reply to his meagre greeting. \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Jeongguk snaps back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFine,\u201d the man replies irritably, hands up in a deflective gesture. \u201cNot your boyfriend, I get it. But is he coming in or out? Because we\u2019ve got shit to do, Jeongguk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe just stopped by to drop off my phone,\u201d Jeongguk says as he looks over at Taehyung. \u201cHe\u2019s just leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The wind is cold on Taehyung\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The pink-haired man looks back and forth between them before making his way back to the living room, muttering something under his breath about\u00a0<em>\u2018time\u2019</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>\u2018melodramatics\u2019</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you going to text?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSure,\u201d Jeongguk drawls in his familiar indifferent air. But this time it feels different; frostier. For the first time, Taehyung isn\u2019t sure if he will.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The door falls shut with a harsh jeering click. Taehyung turns and starts to walk back to campus, towards the lab. He\u2019s supposed to stain a significant amount of microscopic slides today. It will be okay. The work is repetitive and monotone and doesn\u2019t require him to think. He can put on his music and let his body do the work for him, his hands moving through the motions almost automatically.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s scarf still smells of him, making Taehyung\u2019s gut clench. Taehyung wants to take it off but he can\u2019t because it\u2019s cold outside and he hates the cold. It\u2019s one of those days when the sky is completely clear and the sun looks so warm and inviting when you\u2019re inside but once you step outside the cold is biting. The nice weather is but an illusion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the days that follow, the weather keeps deteriorating. Each day gets colder than the one before. Jeongguk doesn\u2019t text. Taehyung doesn\u2019t text him either. Two weeks pass and it's a mile stone of sorts; the longest time they've gone without contacting each other ever since Taehyung first went home with Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung thinks about his pictures on Jeongguk\u2019s phone a lot. About whether they would still be on there or if Jeongguk had deleted them by now. Sometimes he wishes he\u2019d taken pictures of Jeongguk on his own phone. It doesn\u2019t seem fair that Jeongguk can look at him whenever he wants while Taehyung can\u2019t look back, even if in reality Jeongguk probably doesn\u2019t look at the photos at all. Not being able to see Jeongguk, Taehyung resorts to staring at his own reflection in the mirror.\u00a0At first it stings to see the marks Jeongguk had left behind. When they fade, it stings to look at the unblemished skin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin doesn\u2019t ask but he knows when Taehyung no longer goes out at night. They spend a lot of evenings under the blankets watching their favourite shows. Jimin helps him fight the cold; Taehyung helps Jimin tackle his science course. They occasionally go over to visit Seokjin\u2019s apartment, the oldest member of their friend group and a\u00a0<em>Food Science</em>\u00a0graduate student. His home cooked meals are a great remedy against the wintery frost. Hoseok drags them to parties on the weekend. Hoseok knows <em>everyone</em> and alcohol and rooms filled with people are a great way to stay warm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One time Taehyung tries to burn in another person's company, trying to chase away the chill in his chest. But the stranger isn't witty enough, his touch not assertive enough, his fingers too limp. Taehyung shuts him down after a single kiss. At the parties that follow, Taehyung doesn't try again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the end, Taehyung never finds out Jeongguk would have eventually texted him. After almost a month, Taehyung is the one who contacts him first. But he decides to go for a more direct approach. He calls him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It takes three rings before Jeongguk picks up.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYeah?\u201d</em>\u00a0Jeongguk\u2019s voice still makes Taehyung\u2019s heart thump against his chest. Trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHey,\u201d Taehyung answers hesitantly. He picks at the corners of his\u00a0<em>Neuroscience\u00a0</em>study book splayed out on the table in front of him. \u201cChristmas break is coming up.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI know.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s harder over the phone. Jeongguk is difficult to read as it is but without visual cues it feels like talking to a wall.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll be going home to visit my family in two days.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cHmm.\u201d</em>\u00a0The noise sounds dispassionate when coming in the canned tones from Taehyung\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung accidently tears some of the pages in his book and cringes. He was planning on selling that at the end of the school year. Pushing the book aside, he takes a deep breath. \u201cI think I might need a fix to tide me over. There\u2019s not much fun to do where my parents live.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a silence on the other end of the line. For a short moment, Taehyung wonders if Jeongguk might turn him down. All hook-ups have an expiration date and they\u2019re probably far past theirs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cOkay. See you at seven.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The line goes dead before Taehyung has the chance to respond.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The afternoon drags on. The eight-and-a-half hours between the phone call and the time they\u2019re supposed to meet crawl by excruciatingly slow. But then it\u2019s almost seven and Taehyung is trudging his way through the snow, ice-cold water seeping in through his shoes, and time speeds up again. It accelerates mind-bogglingly fast and Taehyung reaches Jeongguk\u2019s apartment far too soon. Before he\u2019s ready.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He knocks anyway.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like the last time they met, Jeongguk opens the door wearing a long-sleeved shirt and a beanie. A voice in the back of Taehyung\u2019s mind is telling him that doesn\u2019t bode well for whatever it is that Taehyung had hoped they\u2019d do tonight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck,\u201d Jeongguk croaks in a voice that sounds like it hasn\u2019t been used in a while. There are dark circles under his eyes, a tired expression on his face. He tugs at the beanie, pulling it up a little before pushing it back in place, fiddling with the fringe peeking out from underneath. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet\u2014with my assignment, I mean. It\u2019s taking longer than expected.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t respond. A small part of him wonders if this assignment Jeongguk speaks of is even real, if this is Jeongguk\u2019s way of breaking things off for good. Jeongguk could have called or texted him but he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d let Taehyung plod his way over through the cold, snow and icy roads, yet he isn\u2019t stepping aside to let him in. Unlike before, Taehyung lacks the confidence to squeeze past Jeongguk\u2019s wide shoulders uninvited.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Things had changed so much after being discovered in the dance studio. They\u2019d changed after not speaking for almost a month. Gone is the easy banter and the even easier sex. In its place is an unfamiliar landscape that Taehyung isn\u2019t sure how to navigate.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung decides he isn\u2019t going to be that person who begs to stay where he isn\u2019t welcome. He\u2019s about to turn around and leave when Jeongguk\u2019s voice stops him in his tracks, \u201cIt should take me like thirty minutes. One hour tops.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung takes in Jeongguk\u2019s broad figure filling up the hallway before him. \u201cDo you want me to come inside and wait? Because you\u2019re kind of blocking the doorway.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat?\u2014\u201c a blank look; or maybe just tired one \u201c\u2014Yeah, yeah, come in.\u201d Jeongguk finally steps back and turns sideways to make room, one hand blearily rubbing at his eyes. As Taehyung enters, Jeongguk is already making his way back to the living room. \u201cI need to get back to that assignment. The deadline is tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods even though Jeongguk can\u2019t see him. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a stranger to essay writing frenzies and desperate all-nighters but it isn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever seen Jeongguk do. They used to be the thing they did to keep their minds off their studies.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After removing his coat and shoes, Taehyung decides to take his socks off as well. His numb toes are never going to recover their feeling if he keeps the soaked fabric on. Dropping them on the old radiator in the hallway with a sigh, he begins removing the two scarfs around his neck with his other hand. Jeongguk\u2019s scarf and his own. A shiver runs across his back when he\u2019s done. He wishes Jeongguk would stoke the place a little warmer now that it\u2019s winter, especially if he might have to wait an hour before crawling up against the hot furnace Jeongguk calls his body.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung enters the living room, Jeongguk is sitting cross-legged on the couch, laptop perched on his lap, books and study papers scattered across the floor and coffee table in front of him. The keyboard makes a rhythmic clicking noise as Jeongguk taps away and the screen content looks scarily similar to Matlab running on a Linux operating system. Two things that feature regularly in Taehyung\u2019s nightmares. In the midst of all the school stuff are food wrappers and two large juice boxes. No glasses.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou drink directly from the carton?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks up with a slightly dazed expression. His eyes flicker from Taehyung to the juice boxes and subsequently the kitchen, like he just realized it\u2019s common courtesy to offer your guests a beverage.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou animal,\u201d Taehyung continues in a sing-song voice before Jeongguk has the chance to speak, because he\u2019s a firm believer of talking over awkward situations or silences. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll show you how civilized people drink.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung walks towards the kitchen. He doesn\u2019t know it inside out but he can find his way to the glassware just fine. None of the glasswork matches but Taehyung had secretly dubbed the mug with a puppy wearing a bowtie\u00a0<em>his</em>\u00a0mug on his third visit to Jeongguk\u2019s apartment. Jeongguk gets the beer glass with the moustache on it. Classy as fuck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung fills the mug and beer glass with orange juice from one of the boxes and settles on the couch next to Jeongguk. He looks in\u00a0<em>the zone</em>, completely unaware of Taehyung, the magically appearing glass of juice on the table in front of him, or the television that\u2019s tuned to a random music station. It\u2019s a state of mind Taehyung isn\u2019t unfamiliar with himself. Neither are the dark eye bags and exhaustion that come with it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung reaches forward to grasp the beer glass, his rings clicking against the cold, smooth surface, and holds it in front of Jeongguk\u2019s face. \u201cYou need to drink, Gukkie.\u201d Taehyung isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s true. In all honesty, Jeongguk looks like he needs a good night\u2019s sleep but the juice is the best that Taehyung has got to offer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThanks,\u201d Jeongguk mutters distractedly, downing the glass in one go. Taehyung takes it off his hands again when he\u2019s finished.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWant more?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d Jeongguk rubs a hand over the back of his neck, trying to work out the kinks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s face takes on a dark expression, giving his laptop a look as if he\u2019s trying to threaten it into submission. \u201cThe assignment from Hell.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung cocks his head. That doesn\u2019t exactly clarify much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk continues before Taehyung has the chance to voice that thought, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special, really. Just an end of term thing.\u201d He lets out a frustrated sigh. \u201cIt was supposed to be finished ages ago. But Hoseok hyung scheduled these extra dance classes and Yoongi hyung got all that new music equipment and that fucking\u00a0<em>MacBook</em>\u2014even though I told him anything\u00a0<em>Apple</em>\u00a0is basically an overpriced piece of shit\u2014and made me help him install all his crap like I\u2019ve got nothing fucking better to do with my time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYoongi hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks at Taehyung, his previous rant voiced in the direction of his laptop. \u201cThe guy with the pink hair.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung remembers him. That\u2019s the person Jeongguk had adamantly told that Taehyung isn\u2019t his boyfriend. \u00a0\u201cThe guy who curses even more than you do.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk nods and keeps talking without further prodding on Taehyung\u2019s part, his frustrations seemingly bubbling to the surface in his tired state, \u201cHe helped me get my first tattoo and I swear, he hasn\u2019t stop lording it over me ever since, always making me do one shitty job after the next for him. Setting up sound equipment, installing music software, designing the cover of his demo\u2014what the fuck do I even know about that shit? I\u2019m a Computer Science Major, not a Graphic Designer.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The sneak peek into Jeongguk\u2019s social life is unexpected and Taehyung\u2019s next words come out unmeasured, \u201cSounds like a wonderful friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shoots him a dirty look. \u201cYou\u2019re best friends with Park Jimin, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re one to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung pivots his body and gives Jeongguk\u2019s hip a playful kick, his foot coming to rest against Jeongguk\u2019s thigh. It feels wonderfully warm under his cold toes. \u201cMy Jimin is the world\u2019s most precious cinnamon roll.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grumbles and rolls his eyes. \u201cWell, good for you. My Yoongi hyung is far from a cinnamon roll. He\u2019s more like a badly burnt marshmallow.\u201d Jeongguk grabs Taehyung's ankle and chucks his foot off the couch. \u201cBut if I ever kill a man, he\u2019d help me hide the body without asking questions. What more could I possible ask for?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou sound scarily sincere when you say that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s because I am.\u201d The conviction in Jeongguk\u2019s words silences Taehyung for several seconds. Jeongguk refocuses his attention on his computer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t think Jimin would be good with dead bodies.\u201d Taehyung folds his legs under his body until he\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the couch like Jeongguk and begins rubbing at his still icy feet. \u201cBut he would cry and hold my hand\u2014visit me in prison each week and send me cookies\u2014so I guess that counts for something.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI like cookies.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk huffs, muttering something about\u00a0<em>\u2018useless\u2019</em>\u00a0under his breath. Taehyung can\u2019t tell is it\u2019s directed at him or the\u00a0<em>ERROR</em>\u00a0message on the laptop screen but he can feel his hackles rising regardless. His best friend isn\u2019t useless.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhy do you dislike Jimin so much?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk sighs, adjusting his beanie again. \u201cI don\u2019t dislike him. He\u2019s just so soft.\u201d He furrows his brows. \u201cSensitive.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019s sensitive because he cares. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not strong. Jiminnie works really hard\u2014for himself and for others. He\u2019s a good person. A good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe probably cares about you too just because you\u2019re his teammate. Even if you two can\u2019t stand each other, he\u2019d still care about you.\u201d Taehyung gives up trying to thaw his feet with his hands. They look a little red now but don\u2019t feel that much warmer. \u201cYou should treat him better,\u201d Taehyung whispers as he watches the redness fade from his skin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a heavy silence but Taehyung soon discovers he prefers that over what comes next, \u201cIs that comment directed at me or at yourself?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s eyes never leave his laptop, voice stoic, but to Taehyung the words feel like a slap in the face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their conversation had progressed into the kind of personal talk that goes far beyond what they ever spoke about in the past. Normally, Taehyung would have left ages ago but this time he hadn\u2019t. He still doesn\u2019t. He hadn\u2019t seen Jeongguk in a month. If he left now, Taehyung doesn\u2019t know when the next time would be. If there even would be a next time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung bites his bottom lip before facing up to the cold, harsh truth. \u201cWe should both treat him better,\u201d he says in a soft voice. \u201cYou, me, the whole world.\u201d He weakly waves one hand towards the ceiling. \u201cThe Aliens on Mars for that matter.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThere are no Aliens on Mars.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI refuse to acknowledge that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk hums in an uncommitted manner, still tapping on his keys. He seems unfazed by Taehyung\u2019s idiosyncrasies. Maybe he just never was.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung glances at Jeongguk from the corner of his eyes. Then he flat-out stares. Jeongguk\u2019s jaw is set as he works and there\u2019s tension in his shoulders. It aches. After a month, they\u2019re finally in the same room again, on the same couch, but he still seems so far away. Out of reach. Taehyung is still cold.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With a small sigh, Taehyung lies down on his back, head on the arm rest, and cautiously buries his toes between Jeongguk\u2019s body and the couch. It\u2019s far from subtle. Jeongguk raises an eyebrow at him, one-part questioning and one-part admonishing. He does that a lot. Whenever he does, the metal of Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrow piercing shimmers in the light. There\u2019s a unique reflective pattern for annoyance, question, disbelieve, surprise, or very rarely utter bewilderment. Any emotion really. Taehyung can\u2019t distinguish them all but he sees them painted in dancing light.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Flashing a rectangle smile, Taehyung wiggles his toes a little. \u201cYour butt is gloriously toasty.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shakes his head. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be allowed to go outside of your house unsupervised.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jeongguk\u00a0doesn\u2019t push Taehyung\u2019s feet away. It makes Taehyung\u2019s toes feel like they\u2019ve died and gone to heaven. The warmth in Taehyung\u2019s torso indicates that his chest agrees.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They stay together like that for a while. Well past the thirty minutes Jeongguk had said he needed to finish his assignment. Once or twice, one of them goes for a bathroom break but Taehyung digs his toes back under Jeongguk\u2019s body whenever he gets the chance and Jeongguk lets him every time. The remote control resurfaces sometime during the hour and Taehyung finds an anime show that he likes. The sound of Jeongguk\u2019s occasional groans of displeasure and muttered curses mingle with the tapping of the keyboard and the Japanese fight cries that are coming from the television. It\u2019s not what Taehyung had come for, or what he\u2019d expected, but it\u2019s not unpleasant either.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At least not until pangs of hunger begin to plague his stomach.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung pokes at Jeongguk\u2019s thighs with one foot. \u201cDid you eat yet, Gukkie?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Jeongguk asks distractedly, but he continues when the meaning of Taehyung\u2019s words has properly sunken in, \u201cNo, not yet. I haven\u2019t got around to it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gets up off the couch and heads to the kitchen, although he isn\u2019t sure what to do when he gets there. He could go to the supermarket and buy some food, put it on the counter, and proceed to stare at it until it perhaps magically cooked itself. Taehyung sighs. Even when frying an egg, he\u2019s a known fire hazard. He has no business cooking food.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Randomly opening cupboards, Taehyung stumbles upon instant ramen packages for in the microwave. Perfection in a plastic bowl. Quick to make as well. When done, he takes the two steaming bowls to the couch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI found ramen.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk dumps his laptop on the coffee table and slides down onto the floor, carelessly pushing papers and books out of the way, before accepting Taehyung\u2019s offer with two outstretched hands. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung eagerly nestles himself on the warm spot Jeongguk\u2019s body had left behind on the couch. \u201cI made myself one too. Finder\u2019s fee and all.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Jeongguk responds without surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll eat well.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s nice watching Jeongguk eat. It\u2019s scary too because Taehyung feels he shouldn\u2019t be so invested in Jeongguk\u2019s health. His chest tightens. Trouble. As Taehyung starts his own meal, his feet zoom in on Jeongguk\u2019s body like two heat seeking missiles, coming to rest on the shoulders in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk cranes his head to look at him with warning. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare poke your cold toes against my neck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung shakes his body with a little whine. \u201cIf you were even half a gentleman, you\u2019d let me wear your\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>\u00a0socks.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk turns his face back towards the television, suddenly invested in Taehyung\u2019s anime show. \u201cWhat socks?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\" Taehyung\u2019s feet give Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder a little nudge. \"You can pretend to be all tough and emo but I saw them once. I know you have them.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a small pause as Jeongguk takes another bite of his ramen. \u201cThose socks are precious to me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell,\u00a0<em>my</em>\u00a0<em>toes</em>\u00a0are precious to me,\u201d Taehyung murmurs darkly. With limited stealth, he moves his feet lower and gingerly squirms his way under Jeongguk\u2019s shirt until the soles of his feet rest flat against his naked back. Taehyung lets out a heartfelt sigh of contentment at the warm contact. \u201cGlorious.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFor one of us maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jeongguk doesn\u2019t rebuke him, finishing up his meal while Taehyung uses him as his own personal heater. Taehyung\u2019s toes heat up fast. They might have been warm for a very long time now, before dinner even, but Taehyung glues parts of his skin to Jeongguk anyway.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s another half hour and an empty juice carton later before Jeongguk slams his laptop close and settles back against the couch between Taehyung\u2019s legs. Taehyung glances at the clock. It\u2019s just half past nine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThirty minutes, huh. One hour tops.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk briefly cracks one eye open to also sneak a look at the clock. \u201cWell, give or take.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks awfully tired. Taehyung isn\u2019t sure why Jeongguk had even told him to come. He isn\u2019t sure why he himself is still there. There hadn\u2019t been a single time in the past when the atmosphere was less sexually charged than it is now. Jeongguk looks like he might fall asleep right there, head resting on the couch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung pulls off the beanie, carding his fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s hair. \u201cYou need a haircut.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou need to burn your sweaters.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m butthurt.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGood,\u201d Jeongguk sighs in a low voice, eyes still closed as Taehyung\u2019s nails gently scratch against his scalp.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s other hand joins the first and together they travel lower, rubbing soft circles on Jeongguk\u2019s temples. Jeongguk looks like he might just melt into a puddle. Taehyung places his thumbs in the middle of Jeongguk\u2019s forehead and drags them outwards over Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrow ridge, briefly caressing the piece of metal he encounters.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYour eyebrows are on fleek.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can see Jeongguk\u2019s lips twitch like he's trying to suppress a smirk. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat they be bangin\u2019. They be on point.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk bites his lip to hide his smile but Taehyung can see his closed eyes scrunch up a little in amusement and grins his own little sly smile. Jeongguk\u2019s still a sucker for flattery and Taehyung still knows how play cute. Maybe things hadn\u2019t changed that much. Maybe things can go back to how they were before Hoseok walked in on them in the dance studio. Maybe Taehyung wouldn\u2019t have to be cold for the rest of the winter.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI take it that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOf course. Who doesn\u2019t like a man with good eyebrow game?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnyone ever tell you that the way you flirt is kind of strange?\u201d Jeongguk drawls his question in a lazy manner, the words heavy with fatigue.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThe way I flirt is just the right mix of cute and sexy. It\u2019s adorable. I\u2019m adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk turns his face sideways, digging his nose in Taehyung\u2019s palm. \u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely memorable.\u201d A slow exhale of breath follows when Taehyung runs two fingers underneath Jeongguk\u2019s ear shell, below the row of piercings. \u201cYou\u2019re memorable.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s not been often that Taehyung got to see Jeongguk like this; passive and pliant. When he has his energy, Jeongguk always likes to be in charge physically and Taehyung lets him. Taehyung isn\u2019t as scared to give over his body as Jeongguk is. It\u2019s his heart that Taehyung worries about because he\u2019s been careless with it before. But now Jeongguk is fluid under his touch; malleable. Vulnerable. Taehyung can feel Jeongguk\u2019s eyelashes flutter against his palm as he runs his other hand across the faint scar on Jeongguk\u2019s cheek. A slow rush of warm breath on Taehyung's skin as he caresses his fingers across Jeongguk's jawline.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can\u2019t stop touching, fascinated by what he\u2019s holding in his hands, unwilling to let the rare opportunity slip by. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen Jeongguk like this. What if he never will again? The thought makes Taehyung\u2019s heart thump violently against his ribcage. Trouble. Still trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung decides it\u2019s high time for their situation to take on some semblance to normalcy, to what they\u2019re used to. There\u2019s safety in routine and theirs was always more physical and not filled with so many words of the outside world. Their bodies talk, so they don\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Bending at the waist, Taehyung places an open-mouthed kiss along Jeongguk\u2019s sharp jaw, following the path his fingers had laid out for him. When he reaches the corner of Jeongguk\u2019s mouth, the man beneath him responds, clasping their lips together. There\u2019s sweetness of the orange juice but underneath it there\u2019s the familiar seductive taste that\u2019s inherent to Jeongguk. Fingers brush over the nape of his neck, keeping him close as their tongues lazily rediscover each other\u2019s mouths, and Taehyung sighs into the kiss. He\u2019d missed this so much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But the position they\u2019re in is awkward, their faces aligned upside down, and being bent in half making the muscles in Taehyung\u2019s back and neck protest. Taehyung breaks their kiss, pleased at the way Jeongguk\u2019s lips trail after him, and slides off the couch and into Jeongguk\u2019s lap. Their mouths melt together again without hesitation. Kissing Jeongguk, feeling his wide shoulders and strong body beneath him, having Jeongguk\u2019s hand caress his side and back in leisurely patterns, feels so good it physically pains Taehyung.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their kiss is unhurried. Taehyung can taste desire and passion, Jeongguk\u2019s hunger that\u2019s always there, but it\u2019s slightly subdued by the his fatigue. This time, it\u2019s a slowly sweltering fire that\u2019s growing between them. But they do burn, their rising arousal trapped between Taehyung\u2019s slowly undulating hips proves they do burn. Taehyung feels so warm, he glows.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pulls back to tug Taehyung sweater and shirt over his head and Taehyung lets him, obediently lifting his arms over his head, because he doesn\u2019t need the garment\u2019s heat anymore. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes feel heavy when he takes in the exposed skin. A month apart had turned Taehyung back into a blank canvas.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty,\u201d Jeongguk sighs as his fingertips skim across Taehyung\u2019s clavicle. That statement shouldn\u2019t give Taehyung the gratification it does. Just like Jeongguk shouldn\u2019t look so pleased to see him unmarked by another person\u2019s lips. Trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung rather not think about what it all means and pulls off Jeongguk\u2019s shirt as well before burying his nose in Jeongguk\u2019s neck. Jeongguk\u2019s cologne smells so much better when mixed with Jeongguk's warm musk. One deep inhale and Taehyung\u2019s head buzzes with it, the blood in his ears rushing, as the heat below keeps pooling. Taehyung moves lower, tasting each line of ink he encounters, the letters below Jeongguk\u2019s collar bone, the ones above his heart, and each unblemished stretch of skin in between. When he reaches Jeongguk\u2019s nipple, he sucks it in his mouth, hearing Jeongguk groan as he grazes it with his teeth, feeling Jeongguk\u2019s hips buck up against him as he nips at it again. It\u2019s left hard and shimmering with his saliva and Taehyung isn't satisfied until the other one looks the same.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung moves backwards of Jeongguk\u2019s lap, hands pressing into Jeongguk\u2019s side, silently telling him to move up onto the couch. Jeongguk obeys, his tiredness making him uncharacteristically docile, and Taehyung settles on his knees between Jeongguk\u2019s legs. Resuming his path downwards, Taehyung mouths along Jeongguk\u2019s sternum, noses at the hard lines of his muscles, dips his tongue in Jeongguk\u2019s navel, feeling him shiver. Jeongguk\u2019s naked flesh shuddering beneath his administration sends all the blood rushing downwards. The slow burn inside Taehyung\u2019s abdomen speeds up, his sweats growing too small as his skin begins to tingle like it\u2019s coming alive.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung teases the sensitive skin above Jeongguk\u2019s waistband with his fingernail, enjoying how Jeongguk stiffens and jerks his hips up. He repeats the action with his tongue, revelling in Jeongguk\u2019s pained groans.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking tease.\u201d But there\u2019s a lust simmering beneath Jeongguk\u2019s admonishing words that tell Taehyung just how much he likes it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTake off your pants and I\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk takes him up on the offer, sliding his sweats and underwear down until they pool around his feet. His dick looks red and swollen, pre-come leaking from the tip, begging Taehyung to touch it. The sight makes his mouth water and he licks his lips in anticipation. If he wasn\u2019t so eager to suck Jeongguk off, he\u2019d probably laugh at himself for how thirsty he\u2019s being. But he resists the temptation and places love bites on Jeongguk\u2019s inner thigh instead.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s fingers twist in his hair. \u201cI thought you said you\u2019d make it up to me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung looks up and flashes him a wicked smile, hands caressing Jeongguk\u2019s legs in deliberate strokes. \u201cSay the magic word.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The annoyance is evident in the twitch of Jeongguk\u2019s jaw, the way his eyes darken. If it were any other time, Taehyung knows Jeongguk would take back control, pin him against the floor until he begged Jeongguk to fuck him. But this isn\u2019t any other time and the tiredness that\u2019s evident in Jeongguk\u2019s every move wins out like Taehyung had hoped it would.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Please</em>,\u201d Jeongguk grinds out between his teeth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung tilts his head in a playful manner and shoots him a teasing wink. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The look on Jeongguk\u2019s face is something Taehyung knows he\u2019ll forever regret not having captured on camera. Not giving Jeongguk\u2019s bruised pride the time to trounce his fatigue, Taehyung slips his lips over the head of Jeongguk\u2019s dick. Taehyung sees all the dissatisfaction dissolve from Jeongguk\u2019s face the moment he gives it a hard suck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The heaviness of Jeongguk on his tongue feels so right, the saltiness tastes so good, but the sounds Jeongguk makes as Taehyung takes him deeper are the best. Taehyung had missed the way it makes him burn on the inside, blood scorching his veins with desire.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung flattens his tongue, running the tip across the sensitive vein at the bottom of Jeongguk dick as he moves upwards. He continues until only the head is left in his mouth and briefly tongues the slit, an almost hurt groan escaping Jeongguk. Taehyung could listen to that all day, needs to hear more, so he repeats the movement, drawing out more of Jeongguk\u2019s wrecked sounds. Every noise feels like electricity sparking down his nerves, right towards his crotch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung settles in a slow rhythm, his hand wrapping around the base of Jeongguk\u2019s dick, moving it in tandem with the bobbing of his head. There\u2019s a small ache beginning to build in his jaw, his eyes watering a little with the strain, but it\u2019s all worth it. The heavy hooded eyes staring down at him, pitch black with lust, make it all worth it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s calloused fingers stroke over the hollow of his cheek, a slight pressure as they push to feel Jeongguk\u2019s dick moving in and out of Taehyung\u2019s mouth. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re so good at that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung hums in agreement, aware the vibration will give Jeongguk even more pleasure. It makes Jeongguk slump his body against the back of the couch, face towards the ceiling as he drowns in what Taehyung is doing to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung slips his other hand down, into his own sweats pants, palming his own dick as he starts stroking it in sync with Jeongguk\u2019s. Normally, Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t let him. He would stop Taehyung because he wants to be the only one touching him even when it\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s own fingers. But this time Jeongguk doesn\u2019t even seem to notice through the haze of his own bliss and exhaustion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can sense Jeongguk\u2019s drowsiness in how he rocks his hips without his usual grace and effortless coordination, the unrestrained moans of pleasure that escape his lips. Jeongguk lacks his usual control, falling apart under Taehyung\u2019s hands, and Taehyung knows it\u2019s a matter of time until he reaches his release. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk seems to know it too, his hand finding purchase in Taehyung\u2019s hair and briefly tightening in warning. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung moves off Jeongguk\u2019s dick, locking their gaze as he drops a hand down to massage Jeongguk\u2019s balls. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You worked hard tonight. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a moment, Jeongguk\u2019s face is unreadable, but then he lets his head roll back again in silent agreement, his hand dropping to the couch. When Taehyung takes him back in his mouth, all the restraint is gone. Taehyung\u2019s lips form a tight seal and he bobs one, two times before Jeongguk comes. Taehyung swallows it all down, Jeongguk\u2019s lewd curses and guttural sounds spurring him on, stoking the fire inside. Taehyung keeps sucking until Jeongguk weakly nudges his shoulder, incapable of taking more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gets up off the floor, wincing at the stiffness in his legs and the uncomfortable grazing of fabric across his hard dick. But seeing Jeongguk pull his sweatpants back up and sink back into the couch with closed eyes like Taehyung\u2019s mouth has ruined him more than makes up for it. Trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung settles in Jeongguk\u2019s lap, finding his mouth for the laziest kiss yet, wanting to bask in his glory, in how he turned Jeongguk to mush under his touch. Even if they didn\u2019t talk for almost a month, Jeongguk is just as hungry for him as he was before.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk pulls away first, skimming the back of his hand over Taehyung\u2019s stomach like a question. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice sounds rough with the after effects of his orgasm, sleepiness pulling him under.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Taehyung is surprised to find he means it. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk slips a hand in Taehyung\u2019s sweatpants, clasping a hand around Taehyung\u2019s dick, making Taehyung hiss. Jeongguk gives it an experimental tug. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel fine.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s fingers are so much better than his own have been and Taehyung's hips thrust up with a sudden need. Jeongguk skilfully collects pre-come to smoothen out the slide. \u201cGet on your back and I\u2019ll return the favour.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung groans as he lets himself fall forward into the crook of Jeongguk\u2019s neck, hot breath tickling sweaty skin as he pants. \u201cJust touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In another uncharacteristic turn of events, Jeongguk obeys, passing up the opportunity to tease and delay Taehyung\u2019s orgasm. Taehyung is already strung so tight from touching himself and the way Jeongguk squeezes him is just right. It only takes a few hot strokes before the fire coiling in his stomach explodes, flames spreading all the way outwards until he can feel it in the fingertips that are digging into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. The low sob ripped from his throat sounds like it isn\u2019t his as his hips stutter through his orgasm, painting both their stomachs white.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can feel his chest heaving as he tries to catch his breath, his limbs slowly becoming his again as the flames retreat. It\u2019s this brief instant when he can almost forget who he is and what he\u2019s doing, the past and future disappearing until there\u2019s only the warmth of this moment, that Taehyung keeps coming back for.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou cheated,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs, belatedly realizing Taehyung was touching himself before, but his accusation lacks spirit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI cheated,\u201d Taehyung admits with a faint grin, pulling his sweats back up. His entire body is humming with contentment.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grabs Jeongguk\u2019s shirt of the couch and dabs at the mess on his own stomach and then Jeongguk\u2019s in lazy strokes. Jeongguk mimics the motion on Taehyung\u2019s back. It\u2019s too good to pull away from, so Taehyung allows himself a few more seconds in Jeongguk\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s lips trail across Taehyung\u2019s shoulder like an afterthought, leaving his signature marks in their wake. \u201cWhen are you going to be back?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It takes a few seconds before Taehyung remembers he\u2019s leaving to visit his family in a few days. \u201cAfter two weeks, I think.\u201d Taehyung threads his fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s hair. \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re not going home for the holidays?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis is home.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s question of,\u00a0<em>\u2018What about your family?\u2019</em>\u00a0dies on his lips when he feels how rigid Jeongguk\u2019s previously liquid body has become. This isn\u2019t a topic open for discussion. Taehyung briefly massages the knots in he feels in Jeongguk\u2019s neck, the muscles are a mess after sitting behind a laptop for so long, and some of the tension slowly seeps out under his touch. \u201cYou should go to bed, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t respond.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Giving the tense muscles one last squeeze, Taehyung slips off Jeongguk\u2019s lap and immediately mourns the loss of heat. He reaches for his shirt and sweater, pulling the clothes over his head. He\u2019s half-resigned to seeing himself out but when he\u2019s dressed, Jeongguk gets up off the couch and follows behind him towards the front door.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the hallway, Taehyung reaches out for the familiar red fabric but stops mid-motion. That one isn\u2019t his; not anymore. He grabs the grey one instead. \u201cThanks for the scarf.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSure.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s eyes are so dark as he watches Taehyung pull on his shoes and coat. The blackness looks so tired. He looks like he\u2019ll fall the asleep the moment his head will hit the pillow later. Taehyung wants to stay with him. With Jeongguk where it\u2019s warm but he doesn\u2019t ask and neither does Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back?\u201d Taehyung doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a question, a statement, or a plea.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk brushes a hand through his fringe. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll text.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods, opens the door and disappears outside into the snow. As he walks back to his place, his shoes get wet again and he knows he\u2019ll have awfully cold toes for the rest of the night. But it\u2019s better than it was before he\u2019d come over. Better than the previous few weeks. Things had changed but maybe they wouldn\u2019t change any further.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wished he knew if that\u2019s what he wants or not.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The next day, Taehyung discovers it\u2019s not all about what he wants or what he does. He never finds out if he would have told Jimin eventually. The day before Christmas break things change permanently and Taehyung can\u2019t take any of it back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Jimin enters their dorm room, he knows. Taehyung just knows Jimin knows. It\u2019s visible in the hurt weighing down the corners of his best friend\u2019s mouth; in the angry creases between Jimin\u2019s brows. Jimin knows.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cChimChim, I can expl\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFunniest thing happened at dance practice,\u201d Jimin cuts him off in a cold voice. \u201cWe\u2019re all done, everyone\u2019s heading out\u2014Happy Holiday cheers and all\u2014and suddenly I see Jeongguk putting on your scarf.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Listening to Jimin feels like a block of ice settling in the pit of Taehyung\u2019s stomach. Suddenly Taehyung can see all the little moments when he should have told Jimin what was going on but hadn\u2019t. All the times when Jimin gave him an opening but Taehyung didn\u2019t take it. The regret is instant, vicious, like a living thing eating Taehyung from the inside and leaving nothing but coldness behind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd stupid me, I ask Jeongguk how he got his hands on it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The block of ice grows, Taehyung\u2019s entire chest starts to feel numb but he\u2019s frozen and he can\u2019t move, watching Jimin dump his dance stuff on his bed as he angrily sorts out his belongings.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSo Jeongguk says he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and that it\u2019s his scarf but I\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0that\u2019s not true. Because I\u2019ve\u00a0<em>seen</em>\u00a0you, Tae. I\u2019ve seen you drag that tattered red rag with the frayed bottom around for almost a month. Indoors, outdoors, you wore it\u00a0<em>everywhere</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJimin, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI was\u00a0<em>so</em>\u00a0fucking worried about you, Tae,\u201d Jimin cuts him off again. His voice sounds so strangled, Taehyung wonders for a minute if Jimin might cry. If he had been crying. \u201cI was driving myself crazy with wondering why you wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin is pulling out his suitcase, dumping it on the bed, putting in the final items after already packing up most of his things the night before. Taehyung wants to tell him to stop but he\u2019s stuck in his seat like an ice sculpture.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI started thinking the weirdest things, Tae. I had all these kind of nightmares about you dating one of the Professors. Or someone who\u2019s already seeing someone else. I don\u2019t know, some dirty old married man\u2014the way you would never stay the night at his place and how he wouldn\u2019t come here. And you just wouldn\u2019t\u00a0<em>tell\u00a0</em>me anything, no matter how often I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut all the while\u2014<em>all\u00a0</em>this time\u2014you were just getting fucked by Jeon\u00a0<em>fucking</em>\u00a0Jeongguk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wishes Jimin would look at him when he talks, would listen to what Taehyung has to say, would give him the chance to explain.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd I could tell that Hoseok hyung knew. And if Hoseok hyung knows, Seokjin hyung knows.\u00a0<em>Everyone</em>\u00a0knew. Everyone but\u00a0<em>me</em>.\u201d Jimin is finally done packing. He finally turns to look at Taehyung who\u2019s still unmoving in his seat. Taehyung discovers he wished for the wrong thing, seeing the hurt and betrayal etched on Jimin\u2019s face just makes it worse. \u201cI feel so stupid, Tae. You made me feel so stupid. Why\u2019d you lie to me?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This is it; Taehyung finally has his chance to speak but the problem is that he doesn\u2019t have anything worth saying. No real excuses. None that make any sense, so he tells the truth instead, \u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s because you like him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The way Jimin says it sounds like a factual statement wrapped up in an accusation. \u201cHe was just supposed to be another of your one-night stands but he wasn\u2019t and now you like him and you don\u2019t know what to do. And you didn\u2019t want to tell me because you were scared that I\u2019d tell you to get your shit together.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s finally able to get up off his chair. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just I\u2014I don\u2019t know. It just happened.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJesus, Tae. In denial much?\u201d Jimin yanks the suitcase of his bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been miserable this past month and you\u2019re going to try and tell me that wasn\u2019t about Jeongguk? Why don\u2019t you stop your lying already? Nobody\u2019s buying it but you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Taehyung doesn\u2019t know how to finish that sentence. He doesn\u2019t know if he can truly say he hasn\u2019t been lying. But Jimin is reaching for his coat, suitcase at his side and Taehyung feels the chilliness in his body grow. The regret, the panic; it\u2019s all cold. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m heading over to Minhyun. He\u2019s got one more free seat left in his car, so I\u2019m catching a ride home with him and Ren.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin isn\u2019t even close with Minhyun and Ren.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut we\u2019re going to catch the train tomorrow,\u201d Taehyung says, denial colouring his voice. \u201cTravel the first part together. Just like we always do.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin says, coat on, ready to leave. \u201cBut I\u2019m really not in the mood for that right now.\u201d He says the next words like it pains him just as much as it does Taehyung, \u201cI need a break.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A break. A break from Taehyung. In all the years they\u2019ve been friends, Jimin has not once needed a break from Taehyung. There\u2019s maybe ten feet between them, Taehyung at his desk, Jimin at the door, but it feels like they\u2019re a world apart. But the distance isn\u2019t sudden, not completely, because it\u2019s been quietly growing for months. Ever since Taehyung started keeping secrets. It increased each time Taehyung dodged Jimin\u2019s questions or brushed aside his best friend\u2019s worries.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s voice chokes when he realizes just how badly he has messed things up, \u201cChimChim, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin\u2019s face softens somewhat when he takes in Taehyung\u2019s state, the anger dissipating slightly from his features, his gaze taking on a resemblance to its usual kinder self. \u201cMaybe we can travel together on the way back,\u201d he offers like a consolation prize. \u201cAfter Christmas break.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u2018When I\u2019m no longer so upset,\u2019</em>\u00a0is what Jimin doesn\u2019t say but what Taehyung knows to read between the lines.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get to my parent\u2019s place,\u201d Jimin promises as his hand reaches for the door, because he\u2019s soft at heart, even when he\u2019s so angry as well. When he\u2019s halfway through the door, Jimin pauses, releasing a tired sigh. He turns to look at Taehyung with eyes that see and know too much at times because they\u2019ve been friends for too long to still be able to truly hide from one another.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnd I do know, Tae,\u201d Jimin says in a gentler voice and Taehyung recognizes it immediately. He instantly knows that he doesn\u2019t want to hear whatever comes next, just like he didn\u2019t want to hear it so many times before. \u201cI know that Namjoon hyung kind of crushed you when he left. I know how much it hurt you when he called you immature and said he didn\u2019t think you were ready for a relationship. But for however book-smart Namjoon hyung might have been, he could be really stupid too. The fact it didn\u2019t work out isn\u2019t all on you. You need to stop keeping people at a distance because you think you\u2019re not right for relationships. That you\u2019re somehow not worthy. Just let it go, Tae.\u201d Jimin\u2019s next words take on a lilt that\u2019s nothing short of pleading, \u201cStop holding yourself back because of people that aren\u2019t even here anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants to do what he usually does in this situation. He wants to tell Jimin he\u2019s no longer bothered by how some past boyfriends may have discarded him for acting outside of the norm. He wants to say he\u2019s just trying to enjoy college life to the fullest and that there\u2019s time for actual dating when he\u2019s older. He wants to say he just hadn\u2019t met anyone who\u00a0really captured his interest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Taehyung\u2019s scared that if he tells Jimin one more lie, he\u2019ll cause a kind of damage that\u2019s beyond repair, so he doesn\u2019t speak at all. There\u2019s nothing but a devastating silence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get home,\u201d Jimin eventually says again, the promise like a small comfort.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cO-okay,\u201d Taehyung replies in his stunted deep timbre, the sound of defeat making it even more hoarse.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a second it seems like Jimin might stay, like his sudden anger has diminished enough now that the initial shock of finding out Taehyung had been sleeping with Jeongguk has passed. Now that he sees how sorry and conflicted Taehyung is. Jimin\u2019s temper flares hot and bright at times but he always has trouble sustaining the flames.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jimin doesn\u2019t stay, leaving Taehyung alone in a dorm room that\u2019s too big for just one person. Too cold without Jimin\u2019s laughter and sunny smile.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A small light flickers on his right and Taehyung reaches for his phone on instinct. When he unlocks the screen, he sees the warning signs he so wished he\u2019d caught earlier. One missed call from Hoseok. A text message from Hoseok too:\u00a0<em>Jimin knows, Tae. I think he\u2019s heading back to the dorm.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Then Taehyung sees what isn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">No missed call from Jeongguk. No text message from Jeongguk either.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s like he\u2019s halfway to Jeongguk\u2019s apartment before he even realizes what he\u2019s doing. For the first time in weeks, the snow doesn\u2019t bother his toes at all. There\u2019s an anger burning in the pit of his stomach that seems to sizzle hot enough to keep him warm for days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He raps his knuckles on Jeongguk\u2019s front door with too much force, gloves forgotten in his dorm room, the skin chafing so badly it might bleed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk opens the door in a large hoodie and beanie. It seems the more clothes he wears, the more distance there is, the more distance he wants. His large frame looms over Taehyung in the doorway with steel is his posture and in his face. He\u2019s rigid and cold. The glint of determination in his eyes shows he\u2019s prepared. Prepared for Taehyung. Jeongguk knows exactly why Taehyung is here.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung balls his hands up in tight fists, nails digging in the palms of his hands. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try and warn me?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk clenches his jaw. \u201cWarn you about what?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t fucking play coy with me, Jeongguk!\u201d Taehyung explodes, his rage burning so bright at the sight of Jeongguk pretending he doesn\u2019t understand what Taehyung means. \u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about! Why didn\u2019t you warn me about Jimin!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBecause it\u2019s not my fucking responsibility!\u201d Jeongguk bites back, fire in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been lying for you for months. I fucking lied for you today. But it\u2019s not\u00a0<em>my</em>\u2014\u201d Jeongguk roughly pokes his own chest with his finger \u201c\u2014problem that Jimin doesn\u2019t fall for that shit anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue, Jeongguk!\u201d Taehyung can feel a sharp sting behind his eyes, tears of frustration threatening to escape. \u201cI\u2019m asking you why you didn\u2019t try to warn me.\u201d Jeongguk rolls his eyes and Taehyung instantly sees red. His life is a fucking mess right now and Jeongguk doesn\u2019t even care. \u201cAnd\u00a0maybe he wouldn\u2019t have figured it out if you\u2019d been a little less obvious!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung immediately regrets the words the second they leave his mouth. There\u2019s a shift in the air, in Jeongguk, in everything. Taehyung had been wrong when he thought Jeongguk was cold before. This person right now, this person who looks nothing like the man he\u2019s been sleeping with and every bit like all the bad rumours, is as hard and unmoving as frozen stone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAre you trying to tell me I can\u2019t even wear my\u00a0<em>own</em>\u00a0fucking scarf?!\u201d There are so many layers to Jeongguk\u2019s hissed words; a question, a challenge, a threat. Taehyung doesn\u2019t know which nuance deserves his attention more. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I, Taehyung? Why is it so important to keep me a secret?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants to stay mad so badly. He wants to take all the anger, frustration, and loathing he feels towards himself for messing things up with Jimin, messing things up with everyone, and selfishly project them onto Jeongguk. Easily shift away the blame, guilt, and regret, by passing them on to someone else, but Jeongguk won\u2019t let him. Jeongguk isn\u2019t a pushover.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJimin wasn\u2019t allowed to know about me,\u201d Jeongguk continues, \u201ceven though you keep saying he\u2019s your best friend. And when someone\u00a0<em>finally</em>\u00a0fucking catches us in the act\u2014when Hoseok hyung walks in on us\u2014you fucking freeze like a deer in headlights. In fact, you still try and keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s so much resentment in Jeongguk\u2019s voice that Taehyung finds it hard to believe he never caught on to it before. But then again, he probably had but tried to smother it beneath playful words and placating touches.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat exactly where you afraid of happening if people knew you were fucking me?\u201d There\u2019s a crack in Jeongguk\u2019s armour. Something flickers across his features that looks a lot like hurt. \u201cWere you scared of what people would think of you? I can\u2019t be all that bad because you had no fucking trouble coming over and letting me turn you inside out each time.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels a wetness on his cheeks. Tears that are too numerous to still be held back. \u201cWhy do you even care about that, Jeongguk? It\u2019s not like you were dying to tell the world about me either. All you ever do is complain about my clothes, my friends, the way I act.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk huffs a little in disbelief, \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not allowed to talk to you about anything else! Because\u00a0<em>every</em>\u00a0time I go just a little off topic, you fucking shut me down and leave!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung doesn\u2019t respond fast enough, Jeongguk lets out a small hollow chuckle.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking coward,\u201d Jeongguk says deprecatingly. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t see you looking at my tattoos all the time. Touching them, kissing them\u2014you like the way I look in private just fine\u2014and I know you want to know what they mean. Yet you never ask. You don\u2019t even have the fucking balls for it.\u201d Jeongguk fixes him with a dark judgemental stare. \u201cWhat exactly do you think is going to change if you know?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Taehyung retorts with venom, driven by this overwhelming urge to defend himself. \u201cBut I don\u2019t hear you talking about your tattoos either! Or why you\u2019re not going home for the holidays, so don\u2019t you even\u00a0<em>dare</em>\u00a0pretend that\u2019s all on me!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s because my dead parents are none of your fucking business!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels like someone just dumped him in a bath of ice water, but judging by the stunned look on Jeongguk\u2019s face, his own words have caused himself an even greater shock.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s head drops down so fast it looks like someone slapped him. He stares at his feet as he roughly adjusts his beanie, takes a deep breath before his shoulders straighten with uncanny resolve. When he locks eyes with Taehyung again, they\u2019re empty and seemingly devoid of emotion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou know what, Taehyung, get the\u00a0<em>fuck</em>\u00a0away from me. And lose my number while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The door is slammed shut in Taehyung\u2019s face with an unmistakable force of finality and rejection before Taehyung even has the chance to think of a response. Although he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to come up with one for what just happened. The scorching heat of fury his veins is gone and the icy despair of regret and guilt is there to immediately replace it. He\u2019s cold and he\u2019s crying and he\u2019s lost. He\u2019s so fucking lost.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung stands there staring at Jeongguk\u2019s door like it might open any second, like Jeongguk might come back and they can pretend this never happened. But Jeongguk doesn\u2019t and Taehyung can no longer feel his fingers, so he leaves. He walks back to campus and passes by his dormitory without stopping\u2014there\u2019s nothing there for him without Jimin\u2014leaves campus again on the opposite side and heads over to another familiar set of apartment buildings.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin doesn\u2019t look surprised to see him, like he\u2019d been waiting for him to show up. Taehyung lets himself fall into the older man\u2019s body like a drowning man clinging to a life raft.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cTry not to ruin this dress shirt, Tae. I kind of need it,\u201d Seokjin chastises, but his tone is mild. A hand immediately starts rubbing comforting circles on Taehyung\u2019s back as he embraces Taehyung in his arms without hesitation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJimin hates me,\u201d Taehyung chokes into Seokjin\u2019s chest. It\u2019s stupid and whiny and Taehyung knows the words aren\u2019t true but he\u2019s hurting, his chest feels like it\u2019s filled with shrapnel, and he wants someone to coddle him and tell him everything will be okay. Seokjin is his best bet, the closest thing he has to a mother figure at campus.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Tae,\u201d Seokjin starts assuring him as if on cue, fingers brushing away the wetness on his cheeks. \u201cYou know what he\u2019s like. Jimin\u2019s anger burns hot but it burns all at once. The art of holding a grudge is completely lost on him.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIs that Taehyung?\u201d Hoseok\u2019s voice calls out from behind Seokjin, but Taehyung can tell the question is merely rhetorical.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung supposes he shouldn\u2019t be surprised to find Hoseok at Seokjin\u2019s apartment. Hoseok and Seokjin may be less similar to each other than Jimin and Taehyung but they\u2019re just as attached at the hip. What one of them sees or hears, the other knows the next day. Between the two of them, they\u2019re rumoured to hold access to all the university\u2019s secrets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin releases Taehyung to close the door and takes Taehyung\u2019s coat. When Hoseok sees the tear marks on Taehyung\u2019s cheeks, he looks two-thirds sympathetic and one-third weary condemnation. He\u2019s nice enough not to throw the words\u00a0<em>\u2018I told you so; I warned you to be careful\u2019</em>\u00a0in Taehyung\u2019s face but it\u2019s still written in his eyes and impossible to miss.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok\u2019s critical\u00a0gaze is broken when Seokjin lets out a rather\u00a0shrill shriek that belies his manly frame the moment Taehyung\u2019s hand accidently brushes against his own. \u201cGod, Tae! Why are you so cold?!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI went to see Jeongguk. We\u2026\u201d Taehyung\u2019s eyes flicker between Hoseok and Seokjin, before taking a deep breath. For the first time in a while he decides to just spill it out and be done with it. \u201cWe broke things off; he doesn\u2019t want to see me anymore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin crosses his arms and narrows his eyes in suspicion. Sometimes he reminds Taehyung of a big pink shark that just smelled blood in the water. Taehyung\u2019s blood. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so upset?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung denies a little too quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Jimin. It\u2019s because of Jimin. We were supposed to travel home together but he\u2019s so mad that he left without me. It\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s not about Jeongguk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHoseok told me about what\u2019s been going on with you and Jeongguk,\u201d Seokjin says and Taehyung feels a very specific kind of dread settle in his stomach. The problem with a mother figure is that the desired coddling goes hand in hand with the undesired parental reprimands. \u201cFrom what Hoseok has heard from you and Jimin\u2014from what he\u2019s seen from Jeongguk\u2014it kind of sounds like you were treating him as your personal on call hooker. Like you were both treating each other like an on call hooker.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It hurts hearing it described like that and it almost feels like it doesn\u2019t do whatever was going on between him and Jeongguk justice but Taehyung supposes it does. It\u2019s exactly how he had treated Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Taehyung admits in a shaky tone, \u201cbut it\u2019s college.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d Seokjin informs him rather succinctly, pre-emptively cutting through all of Taehyung\u2019s possible excuses before he even has the chance to voice them out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tough love; Taehyung isn\u2019t a fan.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And he knows. Goddammit, he knows. He'd known all along that it was stupid and toxic but after what had happened with Jimin earlier, after what had just happened with Jeongguk, it feels like the knowledge will be seared in his memory until the day he dies. He knows.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung tries to convey just that to Seokjin, putting on his best red-rimmed puppy eyes. He can\u2019t take any more. Someone needs to give him a break and take care of him and help put him back together because he can\u2019t do it by himself. Not right now. Not after Jimin. Not after Jeongguk. There\u2019s nothing left.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s but a second before Seokjin caves with a deflated sigh and Taehyung supposes it\u2019s a testament to the sorry state he must be in. Perhaps he looks every bit as lost as he feels. The older man uncrosses his arms and reaches out for Taehyung. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of the hallway. I was just about to start making dinner.\u201d He turns to Hoseok. \u201cDid you wash the rice yet?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s already in the cooker,\u201d Hoseok replies, affectionately tousling Taehyung\u2019s hair in silent reassurance when they pass.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRight,\u201d Seokjin says as they make their way to the kitchen. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll put you both on vegetable duty but you know the rules.\u201d There\u2019s a warning look in Taehyung\u2019s direction. \u201cUnder no circumstance is are\u00a0<em>you\u00a0</em>allowed near my stove.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods, a little unsure why Seokjin still feels the need to tell him that. He hasn\u2019t been allowed near Seokjin\u2019s stove for years. Not since the\u00a0<em>Tupperware</em>\u00a0and open fire incident.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They cook and eat and talk about everything that comes to mind that doesn\u2019t involve Jimin and Jeongguk. They talk a lot about the Christmas break and how they will be spending it, Hoseok and Seokjin taking the lead while Taehyung merely has to nod along with the conversation as he tries not to think about Jeongguk or his parents. They talk about graduate school and gossip about people Taehyung doesn\u2019t even really know except for maybe their faces. But they don\u2019t talk about Jimin and Jeongguk for hours, not even when Taehyung gets his text from Jimin and replies with his own, causing Jimin to send him a second text saying Taehyung is the stupidest person he knows but that he loves him even though he still wants to throw him off a building and burn all his clothes, and Taehyung is so grateful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They don\u2019t talk about it until Taehyung is the one bringing it up long after dinner is finished, nestled on the couch next to Seokjin, head buried in Seokjin\u2019s chest. There are snacks on the table, the posh ones only Seokjin ever has or bothers to make, and they\u2019ve already polished off two bottles of wine. Taehyung thinks he might be responsible for finishing one of them all by himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019s got such nice shoulders, hyung. Glorious and wide like the Pacific Ocean.\u201d Taehyung makes an uncoordinated swinging motion with one hand in a poor attempt to illustrate his words. \u201cJust like you. He\u2019s got your shoulders.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Seokjin clasps his hand together with Taehyung\u2019s, ensuring he won\u2019t poke out someone\u2019s eye with his flailing. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure I\u2019m somewhat unparalleled in the shoulder department.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019s not pretty like you,\u201d Taehyung continues undeterred, and Seokjin hums like he hadn\u2019t expected anything else. \u201cBut he\u2019s so horribly handsome, hyung. Every time I see him naked, I kind of want to cry.\u201d There\u2019s a displeased sound coming from Hoseok\u2019s direction but Taehyung ignores it. \u201cBut sometimes he looks like a bunny too. And it\u2019s so cute but it\u2019s scary too and I don\u2019t know what to do but the bunny\u2019s got like the best dick in the world and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok shoots up in a sitting position from where he\u2019s lying on the floor in disturbing speed, like the undead rising up from their coffin. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he says, waving his hand at Taehyung as if he\u2019s berating a puppy for trying to piss on the carpet. \u201cNo stories about Jeongguk\u2019s dick. Or any kind of dick, for that matter. You think he\u2019s handsome and cute and he\u2019s got good game and lets leave it at that.\u201d He falls back to the floor with an agonized groan. \u201cI don\u2019t bother you guys with my wartime stories about vaginas either.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t mind Hobi, Tae.\u201d Seokjin pats his head like Taehyung is in fact a puppy, unclasping his other hand to reach for his glass of wine. \u201cHe\u2019s just saying that because he\u2019s jealous and doesn\u2019t really have any wartime stories. Vaginas or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok\u2019s face contorts in one of his trademark scandalized silent gasps. He shoots up again to launch into an extensive monologue about how he\u2019s the number one bachelor on campus and how Seokjin can\u2019t judge because his\u00a0<em>\u2018middle-aged gay ass\u2019</em>\u00a0hasn\u2019t gotten laid in weeks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The familiar bickering is strangely soothing. The way they tease each other is savage but amusing just like it always is, yet Taehyung can\u2019t muster a proper laugh. Their spats never last long. As usual, his friends\u2019 squabbling quickly evolves into high pitched laughing as they get off topic. Taehyung finds it hard to focus on their conversation, his hazy mind still occupied with bunnies. And bunny teeth. And round bunny eyes. He needs more alcohol.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou know,\u201d Hoseok says, plucking at the snacks on the coffee table when his laughter has subsided. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself,\u201d Seokjin offers up dryly, wicked smile curling up the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can almost see Hoseok swallow back a sniping comeback because when someone provides you with free food and expensive wine, you adjust your behaviour accordingly, and if they reciprocated each other\u2019s every teasing remark, the conversation would never progress.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ve been\u00a0<em>thinking</em>,\u201d Hoseok repeats, the words lilting as if he\u2019s challenging Seokjin to interrupt him again. When Seokjin doesn\u2019t, his tone grows more neutral, saying, \u201cand I think that Jeongguk\u00a0<em>wanted</em>\u00a0people to find out.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin\u2019s body posture stiffens\u00a0with just the smallest amount of tension, interest piqued, eyes alert. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hoseok shrugs, as if the answer is simple. \u201cWhy else would he wear the scarf?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin nods sagely as he quietly hums with an understanding that is lost on Taehyung. Or maybe Taehyung just really wants it to be lost on him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0<em>his</em>\u00a0scarf,\u201d Taehyung argues, voice small, parroting\u00a0the words Jeongguk threw in his face a few hours earlier with so much spite.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Hoseok says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen him with other scarfs; black ones or something equally depressing. He knew you\u2019ve been wearing the red one around for a month but he wore it anyway. A part of him must have guessed Jimin would probably put one and one together.\u201d Hoseok pops a piece of cheese in his mouth. \u201cTrust me, Jeongguk isn\u2019t stupid and he knows Jimin isn\u2019t either.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The following silence is so heavy that Taehyung can hear Hoseok\u2019s words echo in his ears. His stomach churns at the thought that Jeongguk might have intentionally set off the ticking time bomb that Taehyung had knowingly let sit underneath his friendship with Jimin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou have a point,\u201d Seokjin agrees, twirling the wine in his glass like a well-bred socialite. \u201cHow wonderfully passive aggressive.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Taehyung shakes his head, desperation colouring his voice, panic even. He really needs Hoseok to be mistaken. \u201cIt\u2019s all over anyway. Why did he want people to know so badly?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seokjin\u2019s fingers are tender as they stroke through his hair, like a mother consoling a child. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, Tae. Maybe he just wanted to take back control and force the issue. See what you would do if Jimin\u2014if people found out.\u201d There\u2019s a little weary sigh, as if the three years of age separating them is an almost unsurmountable span of wisdom and experience. \u201cMaybe he wanted you to tell him it was okay to stop being a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Sometimes a final puzzle piece falls in place, in this case a misty outline Taehyung had already caught eye of and was frantically trying to pretend didn\u2019t exist, and there isn\u2019t a feeling of relief and joy. Instead there\u2019s dark, cold regret when finally glimpsing at the image that could have been but will never be because it\u2019s too little, too late, and the vision is already crumbling at the edges, collapsing into nothingness before it even was something to begin with.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a burning behind Taehyung\u2019s eyes, a wetness in his lashes, as he watches his\u00a0<em>could have been</em>\u00a0disintegrate into nonexistence. There\u2019s a painful pounding behind his temples as\u00a0<em>should have done</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>should have said</em>\u00a0fill up the empty space left behind. Not even Seokjin cooing over him with soothing murmurs, petting Taehyung\u2019s head buried in his wide chest, helps dull the ache.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung hopes Seokjin has enough red wine to make him forget this day ever happened come morning.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t forget. Although it\u2019s not for lack of trying and the next day he finds himself all alone on a train that\u2019s about to burst at the seams with the amount of people squeezed inside and with his body stuck somewhere in the stomach-churning state that exists between\u00a0<em>hungover</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>still a little drunk</em>. And Jimin isn\u2019t there to hold his hand.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Miserable doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung gets home, he doesn\u2019t fall into his mother\u2019s embrace, he melts into it. As soon as he crosses the threshold, his mind does that strange thing where you seem to revert back to the exact mental maturity you had when you last lived at your parental home. It\u2019s like a time vortex and Taehyung knows it will be merely a day before his mother will be laundering and folding his underwear as he petulantly pouts whenever his father asks him to take out the trash. All his independency at college, where he does his own laundry (forgoing any folding) and only takes out the garbage when there\u2019s a mountain atop the trash bin, will instantly seem like a distant memory. Another Taehyung in another life; a Taehyung who gets picked up by men at bars and fucks them in dance studios without bothering to take off his sweater. At home he\u2019s Taehyung the son; a Taehyung who walks the dog upon his parents' instructions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And during the day it\u2019s easy to forget. College seems a world away when he\u2019s at home or at his grandmother\u2019s house surrounded by his large family, a lot of them just as loud and quirky at times as he can be. Several of his cousins are below ten, a mental age he feels very comfortable being around. When he\u2019s lying at the bottom of a pile of their flailing chubby limbs, their giggling tinkling in his ears, his chest compresses so comfortably that he almost can\u2019t notice the uncomfortable chill that now lives there.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But there are also times when Taehyung remembers not everyone can escape beneath a human blanket of little children or into their grandmother\u2019s hugs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In one of those moments, Taehyung seeks the help of that one uncle who always drinks too much and tells tawdry jokes. It\u2019s late in the evening on the first day of Christmas and his uncle keeps topping up his glass and Taehyung keeps chugging it down as his mother sends disapproving glances their way. But she doesn\u2019t intervene in time and it\u2019s somewhere around midnight when the drunk Taehyung does what the sober Taehyung was too scared to do and he ends up sending Jeongguk a text. The next morning it takes him five minutes to decipher the message he actually sent, butchered by autocorrect and his own spelling mistakes, and it\u2019s something along the lines of;\u00a0<em>Merry Christmas</em>,\u00a0<em>I\u2019m sorry</em>,\u00a0<em>tattooed</em>\u00a0<em>bunny</em>,<em>\u00a0I miss you\u00a0</em>and something more about<em>\u00a0cute little bunnies</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung lays off the alcohol after that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk never texts back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jimin calls and Taehyung calls Jimin. A lot. Things aren\u2019t the way they were before; before Taehyung started lying to him a few months back or even before Jimin found out about Jeongguk. There are small cracks in the veneer of their friendship that need a little more time to be painted over and disappear like they were never there but at its core their friendship is as strong as ever. They\u2019re best friends. Bros before not bros.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And Taehyung can almost detect something akin to relief in Jimin. Relief it\u2019s merely Jeon Jeongguk, someone Jimin may bicker with at dance practice but who seems pretty harmless beneath the tattoos, instead of somebody much worse. Taehyung doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s offended or flattered at the notion that Jimin thought he might have managed to enter an illicit affair with a married Professor. Mostly offended probably but he supposes that\u2019s what you get for keeping secrets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin called again fifteen minutes ago and now Taehyung finds himself lying on his bed in some old ripped jeans he found in the back of his closet that he\u2019s contemplating taking back with him to university. The days in the dead zone between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve feel strange, being in his old room surrounded by his high school stuff even stranger still, and Jimin\u2019s voice, a bit shrill and mechanical through his phone\u2019s speakers, is a welcome distraction. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cGod, driving home with Minhyun and Ren was the worst thing ever. I\u2019ve seen things, Tae. I tried washing my eyes with soap but it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s already seared into my brain. I tried escaping at a gas station but they promised me they would tone it down and I fell for it like the gullible idiot that I am.\u201d\u00a0</em>There\u2019s a disgruntled little huff.\u00a0<em>\u201cI\u2019m so taking the train back up to uni with you. I\u2019m never setting foot in that car again.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can\u2019t help but feel a little pleased at Jimin\u2019s misery, a little reassured that no one\u2019s capable of stealing his spot as Jimin\u2019s best friend even when they\u2019re fighting.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ll bring candy for in the train and pour hot cocoa over everyone who tries to engage in PDA,\u201d Taehyung assures him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cUgh, no candy, please.\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin sighs a little sadly.\u00a0<em>\u201cI\u2019m eating so much during the holidays already. I\u2019m going to get fat. Who is going to date me then?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can feel his skin starting to itch with irritation. Jimin and the way he diets and exercises relentlessly from time to time aches at Taehyung\u2019s heart. Whatever his best friend does, he should do for himself only and not to please the boys at college. The boys at university are idiots. Isn\u2019t Taehyung a prime example of that?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSomeone who likes you for something besides your abs, like he should,\u201d Taehyung chastises. \u201cHow\u2019s the Teaching Assistant doing anyway? The popsicle one.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cStraight,\u201d\u00a0</em>Jimin deadpans immediately.<em>\u00a0\u201cHe showed me all this pictures of his girlfriend on his phone. I think it was his way of low-key telling me to stop staring at his ass.\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin releases a pitiful whine and Taehyung can almost see him cover his face with one hand in despair.\u00a0<em>\u201cGod, Tae. It was the most embarrassing thing ever. I can never go back.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung tries not to snort a little with laughter, he really does, but it\u2019s so hard. \u201cJust how intensely were you staring at his ass that he felt he had to ward you off with pictures?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d </em>\u00a0There\u2019s the sound of slight giggling.\u00a0<em>\u201cHe wore like the tightest pants. How could I not stare?\u201d </em>The giggling tapers off into a little resigned sound.\u00a0<em>\u201cBesides, that class is torture. I can literally feel myself dying on the inside each time I have to attend a lecture, so I may or may not have fantasized about how the TA looks like without his clothes to stay awake. Desperate times and all.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung says what he always says when Jimin talks about how much he hates the courses he\u2019s taking, \u201cYou should change majors, ChimChim. Do something in the Arts.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a short silence on the other end of the line and Taehyung knows he\u2019s hit a nerve. He always does when he says that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cI\u2019ve bestowed upon you the gracious gift of my forgiveness like five seconds ago, Tae. But you're already nagging me about my science major again.\u201d </em>There\u2019s a slight annoyance in Jimin\u2019s voice but no fire.\u00a0<em>\u201cAre you already trying to get back on my bad side?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI think this might constitute as emotional blackmail,\u201d Taehyung accuses with a little whine, a little peeved by the fact Jimin is using his lingering guilt as a way to stop him from bothering Jimin about school. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good foundation for a friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cThis is me taking advantage of the fact that you screwed up just like any good friend would,\u201d </em>Jimin declares without an ounce of regret.\u00a0<em>\u201cSuch is life.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung scoffs a little. \u201cI need new friends.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cNo one will put up with your crazy but me.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m adorable. Lots of people want to be friends with me.\u201d Taehyung brushes his hand over the rips near his knees. People might make fun of the holes he always cuts in his clothes but he knows the glimpses of his golden skin tantalize people. They attract dark, round eyes that can\u2019t look away. \u201cI\u2019ve once seen one of Jeongguk\u2019s friends in passing. He was short like you but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m not short!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2014he looked a hundred times scarier than you do\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI can be scary!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c\u2014and Jeongguk calls him hyung like he means it and it\u2019s all very suspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cSuspicious?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat he calls him hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cHe calls Hoseok hyung.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut not like he means it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin hums a little in contemplation.\u00a0<em>\u201cYou know, for someone who wouldn\u2019t talk to me about Jeongguk before, you now always seem to find a way to bring the conversation back to him.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For some reason that remark makes Taehyung feel like a little kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYes, you do. You like him.\u201d\u00a0</em>There\u2019s no accusation or teasing tone to Jimin\u2019s words. He says it like he knows it to be true, just like how he knows the world is round and the earth revolves around the sun.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHow can I even really like him? That makes no sense. I don\u2019t even really know him.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about, Tae? You\u2019ve been sleeping with the guy for months.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know.\u201d Taehyung pokes a finger through the hole in his jeans. \u201cBut that\u2019s all we do. It\u2019s just sex.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin releases a long and exasperated exhale of breath at the other end of the line, the flow of air creating an uncomfortably loud, static noise that has Taehyung pulling the phone a few inches off his ear.\u00a0<em>\u201cDo you really think you can only get to know someone by having deep conversations about the meaning of life? All the little things add up, Tae. Even if you try to compartmentalize it and never stay the night. You can\u2019t go at it for weeks like bunnies and expect not to learn anything about each other.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Bunnies, go figure. Taehyung makes the hole is his jeans a little bigger. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cIsn\u2019t, like, eighty percent of communication non-verbal anyway?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201c</em>Two-thirds,\u201d Taehyung corrects automatically.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cWhatever, that\u2019s still a lot.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI guess.\u201d Taehyung bites his bottom lip as he rips the fabric around his knee all the way to the seams on the sides, creating a ridiculously large gap but that\u2019s the fashion these days, so it\u2019s not like it matters.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cTae?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cDoes he call you hyung?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung laughs. A proper laugh that makes his ribs ache. He hasn\u2019t laughed like that in days. He wipes away the tears that have gathered in his lashes when the shaking subsides enough for him to talk, \u201cAre you going to throw a tantrum if he does?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYeah,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin whines, the noise a little piercing over the phone.\u00a0<em>\u201cI think I might throw him down a flight of stairs when he isn\u2019t looking. High ones at that.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung releases a bit more hiccupped laughter. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t call me hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There are a few seconds of silence before Jimin\u2019s voice is back, the words dripping with suspicion,\u00a0<em>\u201cWhat does he call you? It\u2019s something dirty, isn\u2019t it? Wait, what\u2014no, I don\u2019t wanna know. Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d </em>Another short silence.\u00a0<em>\u201cOkay, I wanna know, tell me. Tell me before I change my mind.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBaby,\u201d Taehyung chokes out between shaky laughs, already filled with glee at the horror he can imagine on Jimin\u2019s face. \u201cHe calls me baby.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cTae!\u201d</em>\u00a0There are gagging noises like Jimin might actually be sick.\u00a0<em>\u201cHow can you let him call you that?! He\u2019s two years younger than you, he\u2019s basically just a big nosed foetus.\u201d\u00a0</em>Another heaving sound.<em>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe gets off on it.\u201d Taehyung giggles deep and hoarse, yet strangely child-like. \u201cIt makes him feel all big and tough.\u201d He rubs his hand across his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s cute. Gukkie is cute.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cWhat a little brat. I told you a hundred times already; the little turd has no respect for his seniors.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t call him little,\u201d Taehyung snickers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u00a0<em>little</em>\u00a0about him.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cOh my God, Tae.\u201d</em>\u00a0A tortured groan.\u00a0<em>\u201cYou have the lamest sense of humour. Seriously.\u201d\u00a0</em>But then Jimin starts snickering as well and Taehyung knows he has him hooked.\u00a0<em>\u201cBesides, everyone knows it isn\u2019t the size that matters; it\u2019s what you do with it that counts.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung laughs so hard that the dog comes up to his room to check on the noise, as does his mother. He laughs until he knows his muscles are going to ache for days. He laughs because he and Jimin are stupid and lame together and will probably be that way together until they\u2019re eighty and that makes him happy. Jimin laughs too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When they finally recover from their fit, they talk about family and how nice and weird it is to be home. Taehyung stares at the ceiling, counting the cracks. Later on, he balances a text book on his feet, almost blinding himself permanently as it falls towards his face with a sharp corner heading for his left eye, all the while listening to Jimin puttering about around his own house.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A set of familiar sounds catches Taehyung\u2019s ear after he successfully deflects his book and saves his vision. \u201cAre you drawing something?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cIn a minute. Just taking out my pencils.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDraw me something pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cHaven\u2019t I given you enough pictures?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cPut your name on it too. I\u2019m going to sell them all for big bucks when you\u2019re a world famous artist.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cAs if,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin snorts.\u00a0<em>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be an artist. There\u2019s no money in starving. Besides, if I was, I wouldn\u2019t be taking\u00a0</em>Environmental Chemistry and Physics<em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not giving up hope.\u201d Taehyung bites his lip in contemplation. \u201cMake it a puppy wearing a bow tie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cYou have very unique tastes. You\u2019ll have trouble selling this later.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Everyone loves puppies.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If Taehyung listens carefully, he can hear the scratching of Jimin\u2019s pencils on paper. He contemplates telling Jimin the bow tie is supposed to have polka dots, like it\u2019s counterpart on the mug, but decides against it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin hums.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBeing able to talk to you, I mean. About this. About him.\u201d Taehyung sighs deeply and remorsefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner, ChimChim.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI know, you said that already.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut still, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cYou weren\u2019t thinking. You were being stupid. We all are sometimes. It\u2019s all the hormones and the beer and the greasy food at college. It does funny stuff to our brains.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that.\"\u00a0</em>Jimin snorts.<em>\u00a0\"And I've been forced to watch you inhale your food more times than I can count. Eating like a pig can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t lie. Seokjin hyung is the one who eats like a pig. It\u2019s a joy watching\u00a0<em>me</em>\u00a0eat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cDon\u2019t think so,\u201d\u00a0</em>Jimin disagrees<em>. \u201cAnd the rest of your stupid behaviour is probably Jeongguk\u2019s bad influence. Jeongguk and his dick that calls your name at night.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou really hate him that much?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t hate on babies.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can\u2019t supress a snigger. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean, ChimChim. If you treat him like this all the time, I\u2019m not surprised he doesn\u2019t call you hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cWell, he started it,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin mutters. Taehyung can hear the crumpling of paper as Jimin probably discards a drawing that doesn\u2019t live up to his high artistic standards.\u00a0<em>\u201cAnd he is, you know\u2014a little kid. Beneath all the angst and the tattoos and the seemingly never-ending reserve of basic shirts and beanies. I mean\u2014does he even own anything else? Have you ever snooped around in his closets?\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019s got\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>\u00a0socks but I\u2019m not allowed to wear them.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cRight.\u00a0</em>Iron Man<em>, of course. Anyways, that\u2019s not my point. I\u2019m saying that I think he\u2019s just a little kid beneath the tough guy persona. He doesn\u2019t like that idea of mine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung takes a few moments to digest Jimin\u2019s words. There\u2019s a niggling feeling in the back of his head that there\u2019s more to that story. \u201cDid you go all maternal on him like Seokjin hyung does to us?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The scratching of pencils stops.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>I might have,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin admits begrudgingly.\u00a0<em>\u201cDidn\u2019t go over all that well. It\u2019s just\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it, you know?

The mental image is like an ice-pick to the chest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYeah. Not all alone, of course. He has his friends\u2014he\u2019s not that emo\u2014but still.\u201d\u00a0</em>Another crumpling sound. Jimin can\u2019t draw very well when he\u2019s worked up about something<em>. \u201cAnd I saw him in the park once, playing with an old lady\u2019s dog. He looked like an overgrown twelve-year-old with tattoos, it was weirdly cute. You probably would have gone all heart eyes over him.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t go all heart eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYes, you do. If not for him, it would have been for the puppy.\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin\u2019s voice sounds a little calmer now. Taehyung knows he\u2019d been right; Jimin cares. Jimin always cares.\u00a0<em>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re actually people at school that think he beats people up for a living. Everyone with half a brain can see he\u2019s all bark and no bite.

He can almost feel the rays of happiness through the phone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I still think you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cOf course,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin agrees and Taehyung can almost envision him preening in his seat.\u00a0<em>\u201cBut don\u2019t think I don\u2019t notice when you\u2019re trying to change the subject. You should talk things over with him, Tae. Put this drama to bed one way or the other. You\u2019re going to make dance practice and show cases so weird for me if you don\u2019t. You owe me that. You owe it to yourself and him too.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gets to work on the rips on his other pant leg, easily tearing the soft and worn fabric of the denim. \u201cHe literally told me to get the fuck out of his face and lose his phone number.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin\u2019s end of the line goes completely quiet.\u00a0<em>\u201cWell,\u201d</em>\u00a0he says eventually,\u00a0<em>\u201cclearly he\u2019s a tad bit upset. But, you know, people say mean things in the heat of the moment.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI texted him I was sorry on Christmas day. Wished him a Merry Christmas and stuff.\u201d Taehyung wraps his arm around himself. \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is really a texting matter, Tae.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know. It was a drunk text, anyway. He probably just deleted it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d\u00a0</em>Jimin groans exasperatedly.<em>\u00a0\u201cAnd Jeongguk is just being his emotionally constipated self. You know what little kids are like when they\u2019re constipated, they get all moody and prone to temper tantrums.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI feel like Jeongguk might be the type to hold a grudge,\u201d Taehyung says softly, admitting to his insecurities. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the type to forgive easily.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cMaybe,\u201d</em>\u00a0Jimin says noncommittedly, but Taehyung can tell he thinks Taehyung\u2019s words are true with the way his voice wavers.\u00a0<em>\u201cBut you won\u2019t know until you try. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s all your fault because Jeongguk is an ass. You two are both stupid.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung tries to think clearly but a thick fog of confusion settles over him whenever his thoughts concern Jeongguk. He feels confused about Jeongguk and himself. About Jimin too. \u201cI never thought you\u2019d react like this. I thought you would tell me to forget about him and find somebody nice.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s nice?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>I</em>\u00a0think he\u2019s cute. But you\u2019re not exactly his biggest fan.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cWell, it would have been great if you had picked just about any other member of my dance team who isn\u2019t Jeongguk. But Hoseok and Seokjin hyung make it sound like maybe he likes you and I know you like him. I\u2019d rather see you happy with him than hopping from one-night stand to one-night stand because you think nobody wants you to stick around for the long run.\u201d\u00a0</em>Jimin exhales a worried breath and Taehyung can easily imagine the concerned face that matches it.\u00a0<em>\u201cJust be careful, Tae. Jeongguk has a lot of baggage and he can be a real callous dick. He proved that when he waved that stupid red scarf in my face. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin cares. Jimin always cares so much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s voice sounds suspiciously hoarse when he speaks his next words, \u201cI love you, ChimChim.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>\u201cI love you too, TaeTae.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eventually Taehyung\u2019s mother gets impatient, as does Jimin\u2019s, complaining they\u2019re roommates who see each other whole year round and that they should focus a little more on family for the holidays. The next days, Taehyung dutifully babysits his little cousins, although it can\u2019t really be called babysitting when you just let them run wild and join in on all the mischief. Whenever they come close to getting in trouble, his grandmother is there to save the day without fail. She always did spoil him rotten.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The start of the new year is marked with a lot of happy cheering and well wishes. When Taehyung\u2019s mother kisses his cheek and strokes his hair affectionately at midnight, Taehyung feels completely warm for the first time in days. But it's only seconds later when that warmth\u00a0is replaced by a strange feeling of guilt for having such a happy home even though his rational mind keeps telling him he shouldn\u2019t have to feel that way. He doubts Jeongguk would ever want him to feel that way.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung ends up texting all his friends and the family that couldn\u2019t make it to his grandmother\u2019s house, receiving so many texts in return. It\u2019s not until the next morning when Taehyung discovers a late text amidst all the others, from a number he didn\u2019t text first the previous night, received at three in the morning when he already went to bed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Happy New Year. -Guk</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">No autocorrect. No spelling mistakes. No alcohol.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s all Taehyung needs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s text is all Taehyung needs to dive in headfirst.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jimin graciously allows him to ditch their plans of coming back up to university together while Seokjin gives him the blessing to crash at his apartment with the spare key kept safe by his downstairs neighbour. His parents are surprised but let him leave the nest early despite their disappointment and the next day Taehyung is back on campus, half a week before the dorms reopen and the rest of the students will join him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Without the other students, the college isn\u2019t the same. It\u2019s easy to forget the university\u2019s size when its squares are filled with people but now that it\u2019s empty, Taehyung feels dwarfed by the tall buildings. He only hears his own footsteps, his own breathing, in a place that\u2019s meant for thousands of people. Besides the occasional lost wanderer like him, the campus is a ghost town.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is almost glad when he reaches the other side and enters civilization again, his feet following the path to Jeongguk\u2019s apartment almost automatically. But he isn't glad, not with how unbelievably queasy his stomach is feeling. After months of burying his head in the sand, he has looked up at the proverbial sky and done a complete turnaround, went from 0 to a 100 in 0.1 seconds. This kind of dramatic and impromptu behaviour is exactly the reason why some of his previous boyfriends cut him loose. He knows it is. Yet Taehyung can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s still walking. He\u2019s still making his way over to Jeongguk\u2019s apartment. He\u2019s still carrying a large bag of Chinese takeout.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The food is a peace offering of sorts; one of which Taehyung isn\u2019t so sure how effective it will be. People tend to become more obliging when placated with food and it works with Taehyung but he fears that Jeongguk\u2019s willpower is a lot stronger than his.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Taehyung arrives at Jeongguk\u2019s door, he can\u2019t bring himself to knock. He doubts bringing Chinese food, when maybe he should have gone for fried chicken instead. He doubts coming over to Jeongguk\u2019s apartment and getting on that morning train. He questions all his choices that got him to this point. But then his toes grow frosty and he fears the food will follow and he can\u2019t wait any longer. He finally knocks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s always the cold that motivates him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is about to knock again but then the door opens. It\u2019s another one of those moments when Taehyung wishes he\u2019d captured Jeongguk\u2019s face on camera because (for almost three full seconds) the expression painted before him is nothing but honest bewilderment. Jeongguk is usually quite good at remaining unfazed by Taehyung\u2019s out-of-the-box behaviour, capable of schooling his expressions, his face often a mixture of slight exasperation, mild surprise, and (at good times) a significant glimmer of amusement. It\u2019s not often that he truly shocks Jeongguk and he wonders if there are a lot of people that can. Taehyung wonders if Jeongguk hates being surprised like that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d It\u2019s obvious just how perplexed Jeongguk is by the way there isn\u2019t even room for any other emotion than shock in his voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou texted me.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s normally deep tones sound too high-pitched, the shaky syllables reflecting the doubt and insecurity swirling in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If possible, the disbelieve on Jeongguk\u2019s face grows even larger, his eyebrow piercing disappearing somewhere far under the fringe of his hair. \u201cSo you just hopped on a train and came over?\u201d When Taehyung doesn\u2019t respond fast enough, the surprise on Jeongguk\u2019s face has time to ebb and gives way to the familiar hard lines resentment, his body growing rigid in the hallway. \u201cYou do realize I sent that to practically everyone in my phone, right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That can\u2019t be true. Taehyung can\u2019t accept that to be true because he came all the way here because of that text. People don\u2019t send texts like that to other people at three in the morning if they don\u2019t mean it. It wasn\u2019t a drunk text. If Jeongguk didn\u2019t want to reach out to him, he would have taken more care to avoid him. Hoseok said it before, Jeongguk isn\u2019t stupid.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung slowly motions his head from left to right in denial. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk stiffens even further and crosses his arms over his chest, making him look so broad and impenetrable, and his voice becomes as biting as the frosty wind outside, \u201cAre you here for sex? Because I think we can both find other people for that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That hits Taehyung right where it hurts. He\u2019d been so busy trying not to consider the likelihood that Jeongguk had already found other people for that. Jeongguk is handsome and Taehyung might have been on his own when they didn\u2019t talk for a month, with his family during Christmas break, but that doesn\u2019t mean Jeongguk had been alone. It doesn\u2019t mean Taehyung\u2019s absence in Jeongguk\u2019s bedsheets wasn\u2019t compensated for with the heat of somebody else. Somebody better.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not here for sex.\u201d Taehyung lifts the bag he\u2019s holding up a little in a weak attempt to entice Jeongguk. \u201cI brought food. I\u2026I want to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk stares at the bag of food like it might contain a bomb before brushing his hand through his hair rather brusquely, something Taehyung is starting to identify as a sign of Jeongguk\u2019s nerves, a sign that he isn\u2019t quite sure what to say or do. And Jeongguk does look confused at the moment. Confused and angry and a little lost despite his harsh words. His tough demeanour seems ironically fragile, like it might break if Taehyung taps it a little too hard.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants it to break.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGukkie,\u201d Taehyung pleads in a soft voice, eyes wide and imploring. \u201cI feel bad about what happened. About our fight. I want to talk about it. I want to try and make it right.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk drops his gaze to the floor and rubs the back of his neck. Something that sounds like a cross between a disbelieving huff and a hollow snigger leaves his mouth. \u201cAnd what if you can\u2019t make it right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words chill Taehyung all the way down to his bones. It\u2019s a possibility he\u2019s been trying very hard to ignore these past days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI want\u2026I want to try.\u201d Taehyung wants to show him just how badly he wants to try but it\u2019s hard when Jeongguk still has his eyes cast downwards. \u201cIf the talking\u2014if it doesn\u2019t help, I\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll let you be.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Jeongguk takes a step back, Taehyung braces himself for the impact of the door slamming shut in his face again but it never comes. Jeongguk merely turns and walks back into his apartment, leaving the entrance open for Taehyung.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Collecting all his courage, Taehyung steps over the threshold and into the hallway. After closing the door and removing his coat and scarf, Taehyung cautiously enters the living room where Jeongguk is already setting down two plates on the coffee table in case they need it. Taehyung joins him on the floor, taking out all the food cartons and the wooden chopsticks to arrange them on the table in awkward silence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk is the first to start eating, saying nothing and grabbing a carton seemingly at random. Taehyung follows his example, despite his queasy stomach, and the sound of them eating does nothing but make the quiet between them boom even louder.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is supposed to talk about why he\u2019s here, confess what he\u2019s feeling, but he can\u2019t. Not like this. Not when Jeongguk is so far away even though they\u2019re a mere two feet apart. Not when it seems so likely that Jeongguk won\u2019t want to hear what he\u2019s got to say.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung spots a few empty liquor bottles and before he can stop himself, he\u2019s saying something completely else, \u201cHow did you spend the holidays?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s chopsticks freeze mid-motion, eyes dark in warning as they focus on Taehyung. \u201cAre you asking me if I spent them sad and alone? Curled up on the couch with a bottle of booze?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung supposes that in a way he is asking if Jeongguk was alone this past week but not in the pitying way Jeongguk is implying. Not like that. \u201cNo, I\u2019m asking you how you spend the holidays.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s a full two seconds till Jeongguk breaks his punishing gaze and focuses his attention back on the food. \u201cI spent the holidays with Yoongi hyung mostly\u2014a few other friends\u2014but mostly Yoongi hyung.\u201d Jeongguk twirls the chopsticks absentmindedly in the carton he\u2019s holding. \u201cWe spend most holidays together because he doesn\u2019t go home much.\u201d There\u2019s a brief pause like he doesn\u2019t know if he should continue. \u201cHis parents; they don\u2019t agree with his tattoos. His pink hair. His music. Anything that makes him\u00a0<em>him</em>, really.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat must be hard,\u201d Taehyung eventually says for lack of anything better. He\u2019s never been in the position where his parents didn\u2019t support him. He\u2019s never felt he couldn\u2019t go home for the holidays.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">From the corner of his eyes, Taehyung watches Jeongguk eat the food he brought. Some of the hardness has seeped from Jeongguk\u2019s features, so maybe hot food does mellow people out and it doesn\u2019t just work on Taehyung. Maybe the silence is just as horrible for Jeongguk as it is for him and maybe Jeongguk is just as eager to break it with words. Perhaps they could talk some more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou two seem really close.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend of my brother. When Junghyun hyung went abroad on a scholarship and I stayed behind, Yoongi hyung kind of took me under his wing. I was young and na\u00efve and I didn\u2019t realize I was making a deal with the devil.\u201d He switches to another food carton. \u201cEvery night I pray for him to make it big, so I\u2019ll no longer have to help him drag his sound equipment to every gig and back.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words are acerbic, said without a laugh to soften the blow, but Taehyung can\u2019t believe Jeongguk actually means it. Taehyung can only imagine how much their company must mean to each other in their current situation. He also realizes what it means that Jeongguk is sharing this personal information with him, even though their conversation is stunted and full of uncomfortable pauses, and Taehyung\u2019s stomach finally settles down. That Jeongguk is telling him this means he hasn\u2019t shut Taehyung out completely,\u00a0<em>isn\u2019t</em>\u00a0shutting him out completely.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe has gigs? Is he in a band?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shakes his head. \u201cYoongi hyung raps.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grabs the carton with stir-fried shrimp as he tries to picture the short pink-haired man rapping in his drunk voice, syllables rolling. \u201cI can see that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, he\u2019s good,\u201d Jeongguk confirms as he accepts the carton when Taehyung is done with it, fingers briefly brushing against each other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can feel his cheeks heat up and he wonders if this small touch is really making him blush. \u201cDo you rap?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ve sung a few background vocals on his tracks. He says I did \u2018alright\u2019.\u201d Jeongguk rolls his eyes a little. \u201cI think it was a euphemism for \u2018you\u2019re cheap and I can\u2019t afford a decent singer\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An amused snort escapes Taehyung and Jeongguk looks at him in surprise. Taehyung offers him an insecure smile in return. \u201cWouldn\u2019t he have taken you off the tracks if you weren't good?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s that unreadable expression in Jeongguk\u2019s eyes again but then he breaks contact and directs his gaze back to what\u2019s left of the food. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A sudden curiosity grapples at Taehyung, he wants to hear Jeongguk sing, but he knows Jeongguk won\u2019t ever do that. Taehyung settles for the next best thing. \u201cI think I\u2019m curious now. Can I catch one of his shows?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYoongi hyung performs all around town. At least once a week. Shouldn\u2019t be hard,\u201d Jeongguk responds noncommittedly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung stops himself before he can ask Jeongguk to take him to one.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s not long until the rest of the food is finished. Taehyung starts to take a deep breath to\u00a0say what he came to say but then Jeongguk starts talking first, \u201cHow did you spend the holidays?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s deep breath stilts in the process and he exhales a little awkwardly. \u201cWith my family. At my grandmother\u2019s house mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After a few seconds hesitation, Taehyung digs up his phone. He wonders if it\u2019s poor form to flaunt family pictures in an orphan\u2019s face but Jeongguk asked and he no longer wants to be that coward who\u2019s scared of sharing anything personal. He feels like Jeongguk would be the kind of person who hates it when people don\u2019t talk about their family because he doesn\u2019t have his parents anymore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung pulls up the most recent picture of him and his grandmother, taken just two days ago, and hands him the phone. \u201cThis is her.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s face is stoic as he observes the screen but then Taehyung thinks he can observe a small grin. \u201cShe looks like she\u2019s trying to suffocate you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s grandmother is indeed a fierce hugger. He grins along with Jeongguk. \u201cShe calls it love.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s thumb hovers over the screen as he glances in Taehyung\u2019s direction, one eyebrow raised in question. Taehyung nods almost imperceptible, giving Jeongguk silent permission to scroll through the pictures. Of course, irony deems it fit that the next image is of Taehyung and his parents. Taehyung is torn between snatching the phone out of Jeongguk\u2019s hand or burning a hole in Jeongguk\u2019s face with his intense staring.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYour mom is pretty,\u201d Jeongguk says without looking up, \u201cbut you look more like your dad.\u201d There\u2019s a small pause as Jeongguk cocks his head a little. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung slaps Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder in retribution and steals his phone back without so much as a thought, catching himself off guard. Taehyung thinks his strange and overly familiar response is mostly driven by surprise and relief. Relief that the picture doesn\u2019t seem to bother Jeongguk that much. Relief that Jeongguk is capable of joking about it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMy dad is handsome,\u201d Taehyung protests a little petulantly. \u201cI\u2019m handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk actually snickers at that. \u201cI guess we\u2019re all entitled to our own opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung thinks that maybe he should be offended but he can only feel happy upon seeing Jeongguk smile. There\u2019s a warmness in Taehyung\u2019s chest that\u2019s coming back alive and it feels fuzzy when it expands outwards and grows. It feels hopeful. He cracked Jeongguk\u2019s though shell.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung decides to continue along the same track and pulls up another picture on his phone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI have tons of cousins.\u201d Taehyung waves an image of himself and a little girl with pig tails in Jeongguk\u2019s face. \u201cI know you\u2019re not supposed to have favourites but she\u2019s my favourite. I\u2019ll have you know that she always says I\u2019m the \u2018handsomest\u2019 boy she knows and that she wants to marry me when she\u2019s older.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk snorts a little and Taehyung is quite sure that there\u2019s a teasing twinkle in his eyes. \u201cDid you break the news to her yet? About how you two are family? Or that you like dicks?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRude,\u201d Taehyung says, as he shoots Jeongguk an offended look that\u2019s only partially fake. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll wizen up to the facts eventually. With age comes wisdom, Gukkie. For now, I\u2019m perfectly content with her thinking there\u2019s fairy dust and sunshine coming out of my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI think she might have you mixed up with Hoseok hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know Hoseok hyung and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s not the only ball of sunshine at this university. I\u2019m positively radiant.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk chuckles and Taehyung can\u2019t help but like the rush that comes with hearing Jeongguk laugh. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI say I\u2019m handsome and delightful.\u201d Taehyung keeps scrolling. \u201cThis is my dog.\u201d He proudly shows off a picture of his mixed breed Jindo dog.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cSoonshimmie,\u201d Jeongguk says without missing a beat. When Jeongguk realizes what he gave away, he immediately averts his eyes and starts stacking the empty cartons, like that would counteract the fact that he remembered the name of Taehyung\u2019s dog. Taehyung can\u2019t even recall telling him that and the hopeful feeling in his chest grows. It\u2019s funny how Jeongguk\u2019s hostile behaviour breaks down and Taehyung\u2019s insides instantly flutter. Still trouble.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung confirms, trying to dispel the discomfort of the moment by talking over it. \u201cThat\u2019s Soonshimmie. She\u2019s the cutest dog ever.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It doesn\u2019t help. Jeongguk is stuffing the empty food cartons back in the plastic bag, putting the still full ones to the side, all the while avoiding the act of so much as glancing in Taehyung\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung reaches out on instinct, placing a hand on Jeongguk\u2019s biceps and feels it become rigid beneath his touch. \u201cGukkie?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk stops his cleaning and falls back against the couch looking almost defeated, like Taehyung wore down his defences and broke down his resolve, his gaze never leaving an invisible spot on the wall in front of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHoseok hyung,\u201d Taehyung stammers awkwardly, not knowing where to start. He swallows thickly. \u201cHoseok hyung said you probably wore the red scarf on purpose.\u201d Jeongguk still won\u2019t look at Taehyung\u2019s questioning eyes. \u201cIs that\u2014Is that true?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders stiffen, his chin raising up in a familiar defiant lilt as he simultaneously clenches his jaw, like he\u2019s ready for Taehyung to fight him on this. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For what may be the first time, Taehyung recognizes Jeongguk\u2019s antagonistic posture for what it is; a defence mechanism. So, unlike the last time they spoke, Taehyung remains calm, keeps his voice devoid of fire and anger as he speaks, \u201cWhy? Why did you wear the scarf, Gukkie?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks completely taken aback by the lack of acrimony Taehyung is displaying, so prepared for another argument that he doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do when that argument doesn\u2019t come. His shoulders slump, all the confidence melting away under Taehyung\u2019s eyes like snow under the sun. Jeongguk looks tired, fragile, and Taehyung regrets ever asking.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But at the same time Taehyung doesn\u2019t regret it. This is safe. Taehyung much rather have Jeongguk be vulnerable before him than the other way around.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And Jeongguk is vulnerable. There\u2019s something very brittle behind Jeongguk\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cWhat do you want me to say, Taehyung? That I like you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s heart beats violently against his ribcage as if it\u2019s trying to get closer to Jeongguk. Taehyung does what his heart tells him and leans forward, his free hand tracing the scar on Jeongguk\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDo you?\u201d Taehyung whispers. Asking Jeongguk if he likes him is so much easier than confessing first. Taehyung won\u2019t allow himself to be put in the position of being the one capable of getting hurt. He\u2019s done that too often in the past.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s a slight quiver to Jeongguk\u2019s bottom lip when Taehyung runs a thumb across it and Taehyung lets himself fall those final few inches to capture it between his own. It\u2019s not as much a kiss as it's supposed to be a demand. It\u2019s Taehyung willing Jeongguk to confess to him so he can finally say it back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cStop,\u201d Jeongguk mutters in broken tones against Taehyung\u2019s lips, but Taehyung can\u2019t. Not until Taehyung can make Jeongguk understand the depth of what he feels. But then Jeongguk\u2019s hands are on his shoulders, pushing him away as if Taehyung has poison in his mouth. \u201cStop it! Get away from me!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung stares at him with wide eyes. This isn\u2019t right. This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to be. Jeongguk likes him, Taehyung had been so sure. \u201cGukkie?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck!\u201d Jeongguk curses as he cards both hands through his hair in agony. \u201cI hate this!\u201d He looks at Taehyung with red-rimmed eyes, as if he\u2019s fighting back his tears. \u201cI fucking hate you!\u201d The words are like a knife, cutting the warmth right out of Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cI hate you and those hideous sweaters you always wear,\u201d Jeongguk continues in a voice that seems crippled with hurt. \u201cI hate how they make you look. I hate how you drown in them until all I can see are your collarbones. I hate how you smile at me until your face is no eyes and all teeth. I hate how you always call me Gukkie. I fucking hate how weak it makes me feel.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This isn\u2019t right at all. Something is going very, very wrong. Jeongguk\u2019s words cut. They cut at Taehyung but, worst of all, they seem to cut at Jeongguk too. Taehyung tries to reach forward again. \u201cGukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cStop it!\u201d Jeongguk demands, arms up to defence so Taehyung won\u2019t touch him, but it almost sounds like he\u2019s begging instead. \u201cStop calling me that. Stop playing with me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Taehyung stammers. \u201cI\u2019m not playing with you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Jeongguk accuses with anguish. \u201cYou\u2019re\u00a0<em>always</em>\u00a0fucking playing with me. You come over to my place, you take what you want, and then you fuck off to wherever it is you came from. And every time I try to talk, you shut me up with sex. And I don\u2019t want that anymore. I don\u2019t want to feel used like that but every time I try to break it off, you call or text me. Because\u00a0<em>those</em>\u00a0are the times when you\u2019re suddenly able of reaching out to me first.\u201d Jeongguk wraps an arm around his waist as if he needs to protect himself against Taehyung. \u201cBut in the end you never stay. And I couldn\u2019t ask you because I was scared that meant you were never coming back. You won\u2019t give me what I need but you also won\u2019t let me go. You were upset people found out about me.\u201d Jeongguk shakes his head like he\u2019s trying to ward Taehyung off. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me at all.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels like he\u2019s in a dream. The dream in which you think you\u2019re falling and he\u2019s stuck in the horrific moment right before you wake up when you\u2019re paralyzed with vertigo and dread.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Taehyung says, stumbling over his words in his haste to get them out. \u201cGukkie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Taehyung reaches out to brush a hand over the scar again, wiping away the wetness there with his thumb. \u201cYou have it all wrong, Gukkie. It\u2019s not like that. I care. I care about you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Jeongguk pleads. \u201cYou\u2019re just here for the sex and after that you\u2019ll leave. You always do.\u201d There\u2019s a small choke. \u201cIt\u2019s like you get off on the power you have over me. On always being able in roping me back in.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung\u2019s shakes his head in desperation. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I swear that\u2019s not true.\u201d He cups Jeongguk\u2019s jaw with both hands. The anxiety Taehyung experiences at seeing Jeongguk like this is mind-altering. Taehyung would do anything to make it stop. Anything to make it right. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stay. I want to stay. I\u2019ll stay the night if you let me. Not for the sex. We don\u2019t have to have sex. I want to stay because I missed you and I want to be with you.\u201d He cradles Jeongguk\u2019s face like it\u2019s precious. And it is precious. Jeongguk is precious to him. \u201cI like you, Gukkie. I like you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Jeongguk whispers with big and insecure eyes. And Taehyung can\u2019t see the piercings or the tattoos, all he sees is how young Jeongguk looks. How much he reminds Taehyung of himself, of how Taehyung was with all the boyfriends that didn\u2019t treat him right in the past. How he was with Namjoon. But this time it isn\u2019t Taehyung getting hurt, it\u2019s Jeongguk. Jeongguk isn\u2019t trouble; Taehyung is.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d Taehyung says, and now he\u2019s the one crying. \u201cI promise I\u2019m not lying. I like you, Gukkie. I really do. And I\u2019m sorry I hurt you. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you and I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel this way. I was\u2026I was too wrapped up in my own feelings. I didn\u2019t notice. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Taehyung finally pulls back his hands to wipe away his own tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And then there\u2019s nothing but their shaky breaths between them as they try pick up the pieces and put themselves together again. Their bodies left battered by the onslaught of their own feelings that spilled from their mouths like they were powerless from stopping it, the emotions so intense that they transformed into a pain that\u2019s physical.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIf you like me,\u201d Jeongguk ultimately says in a hesitant voice, eyes dry again but still full of hurt, \u201cwhy do you always leave me?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is sure he had a hundred excuses before coming over to see Jeongguk but none of them seem valid anymore. None of them carry any weight when he considers how he made Jeongguk feel. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a coward,\u201d Taehyung eventually responds, \u201cjust like you said in our fight. I was\u2026I was scared because I didn\u2019t want to like you. I didn\u2019t want to like anyone.\u201d Taehyung lifts his hands in a helpless attempt at articulating what had motivated him at the time. It\u2019s just that he hardly understands his own impulses himself. \u201cI think I went home with you that first time because I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d like me either. That you weren\u2019t interested in anything but a one-night stand.\u201d Taehyung sighs regretfully when he thinks back on how they got tangled up in this twisted game of push-and-pull where nobody seems to win and everybody seems to lose instead. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t just handsome and sexy; you were cute and funny too. And when you called me to hook up again, I told myself \u2018one more time\u2019. But one more time turned into lots of times and I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk doesn\u2019t look like he understands and Taehyung can\u2019t blame him. Taehyung doesn\u2019t understand either.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about liking someone?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHave you,\u201d Taehyung starts, franticly trying to find the right words. \u201cHave you ever been in a serious relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shakes his head. \"Never been really interested in that.\" His eyes fall down like he\u2019s almost ashamed to admit it. \"Just lots of random hook-ups instead. I'm just...I'm just a wild night to people.\"</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019ve had a few relationships,\u201d Taehyung tries to explain. \u201cNot all serious but the last one was. When they left\u2014when Namjoon left, it hurt. I didn\u2019t want to do that again. I didn\u2019t want someone telling me they liked me, telling me that I\u2019m funny and quirky and that\u2019s why they want to be with me, why they can\u2019t get enough of me. I didn\u2019t want another person telling me to be myself and share all my secrets only to change their minds a few months down the road. I didn\u2019t want another person suddenly saying I\u2019m too much, too weird, too hard to keep up with.\u201d Taehyung can feel himself choke up again and tries to bite it down, tries to ignore the burning behind his eyes. \u201cThat I\u2019m too immature and always embarrassing them in public. Fun as a friend maybe but not boyfriend material.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s already crying until Jeongguk cups his jaw with one hand and brushes away the tears on his cheekbone, just like he had done for Jeongguk earlier. The calloused pads of Jeongguk\u2019s fingers are more comforting than his own hands could ever be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBefore them, I was never insecure about myself like that,\u201d Taehyung continues. \u201cI just wanted my last year of undergrad school to be fun, to continue with a graduate degree next year and maybe when I finished that\u2014when some of the hurt and my eccentricities had eroded away\u2014I could see if there was anyone willing to put up with me on the long-term. I thought I needed a break from anything more than just sex.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk drops his hand back on his lap and Taehyung immediately longs to have it back on his skin, its absence painful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to put up with you,\u201d Jeongguk says, voice still coarse with emotion. \u201cI want\u2026I want to be around you. And I like that you\u2019re different\u2014that you stick out like a sore thumb sometimes\u2014just like me. It makes me feel normal.\u201d Jeongguk rubs at the back of his neck, seeming to struggle in his search for words. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be able to embarrasses me in public. When I go out, people only seem to notice the tattoos and the piercings. That\u2019s all they ever see.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s an undercurrent to Jeongguk\u2019s last statement and Taehyung remembers all the rumours; Jeongguk\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t care about those. I\u2019m not ashamed of you, Gukkie,\u201d Taehyung declares, fraught in his attempt to reassure Jeongguk. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I kept you a secret. I didn\u2019t care if people found out. It was only ever about hiding from Jimin. I didn\u2019t want Jimin to find out about you because he\u2019s my best friend and he would have been able to see right through me. I knew he wouldn\u2019t have left me alone. He would have been telling me to get my head out of the past, or out of my ass, or maybe both, and sort this shit out.\u201d Taehyung pauses, thinking about his phone calls with Jimin. \u201cHe did tell me to sort this out. To make things right with you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIs that why you came here?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung knows what Jeongguk is really asking and this time Taehyung is determined not to try and force Jeongguk\u2019s hand. This time Taehyung would be vulnerable for Jeongguk instead of making Jeongguk vulnerable for him. \u201cI came because I wanted to tell you I was sorry and that I like you.\u201d Taehyung bends forward to smooth out the strands of Jeongguk\u2019s hair that he ruffled up when he was so upset. Jeongguk leans into Taehyung\u2019s hand and the sight causes a bittersweet ache. Taehyung feels the warmth in his chest return but now it\u2019s spiked with a fierce surge of protectiveness. \u201cWhy did you let me in?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk no longer looks brittle\u2014open, but not brittle. \u201cBecause I like you too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That confession triggers so many emotions that Taehyung doesn\u2019t know on what to focus first. The happiness, the relief, the affection, they all mingle together into a warm haze that\u2019s only broken by the sharp spice of his adrenaline rush. A rush at being able to call Jeongguk his.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung slides into Jeongguk\u2019s lap, their bodies slotting together more perfectly now than they ever did before. Jeongguk feels so strong, broad and solid beneath him but this time Taehyung doesn\u2019t forget he\u2019s fragile under his touch too. Underneath the tattoos and the piercings, Jeongguk is vulnerable in Taehyung\u2019s hands. Jeongguk is not trouble, he\u2019s precious, and Taehyung needs to take care not to break him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They kiss and this time it\u2019s a kiss between equals and not a struggle for power. This time Jeongguk doesn\u2019t push him away but tries to get closer. This time they\u2019re not trying to steal, they\u2019re trying to give. There\u2019s adoration lacing Jeongguk\u2019s ever present hunger as his tongue explores Taehyung\u2019s mouth and there\u2019s extra care in the way Taehyung cards his fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When they break apart, Taehyung presses a soft, fluttery kiss against Jeongguk\u2019s nose like he\u2019s wanted to do so many times before. \u201cCan I stay?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk says as he tries to capture Taehyung\u2019s mouth with his again. \u201cYou can stay.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For the first time, Taehyung does stay. He changes into one of Jeongguk\u2019s shirt and sweatpants that swallow his thinner frame and discovers sleeping in the same bed as Jeongguk is just two degrees shy of disastrous. Jeongguk sniffles. Taehyung vaguely remembers an offhand comment about Rhinitis and he used to not even really notice anymore but in the dark and quiet of the bedroom the noise is unescapable. But the suffering is mutual. According to Jeongguk, Taehyung is a blanket-hogger in addition to sleeping like a starfish, slowly forcing Jeongguk out of his own bed inch by inch. Somewhere around three o\u2019clock at night, Jeongguk threatens to make Taehyung sleep on the floor if he pokes his\u00a0<em>\u2018cold-ass toes\u2019</em>\u00a0against Jeongguk\u2019s thigh one more time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But in the morning, when Taehyung can see the dust particles dancing above their heads in the early sunlight and Jeongguk is sleeping so soundly that he doesn\u2019t notice Taehyung wrapping his body around him like a koala, Taehyung thinks he wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else. It takes listening to twenty of Jeongguk\u2019s heartbeats beneath his ear before Taehyung is pulled under into a deep slumber.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">No place makes Taehyung feel warmer than Jeongguk\u2019s bed with Jeongguk in it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">No place feels warmer than Jeongguk\u2019s bed with Jeongguk in it and that\u2019s exactly the reason why Taehyung is a little disgruntled when he wakes up all by himself. Alone. In a bed that\u2019s feeling a tad bit chilly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung groans, burying deeper under the duvet, as images of Jeongguk in workout gear flash before his mind\u2019s eye. Something about running. Taehyung scrunches up his eyebrows in thought, starting to put together the fuzzy pieces floating in his head. Jeongguk had said he was going for a run when Taehyung had still been to drowsy to completely comprehend what was happening, falling back asleep the second Jeongguk had left the room.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Another tortuous groan escapes past Taehyung\u2019s downturned lips. God, who even does that? Who goes for a run at ass o\u2019clock? Taehyung pushes aside his messy fringe, squinting at the bedside alarm. 10:42. Well, maybe not ass o\u2019clock but that\u2019s still pretty early when you consider that they\u2019re on their Christmas break.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung pulls the blanket up to his nose, counting the cracks in the ceiling as he engages in a battle of wills with his bladder. His lips straighten into a terse line of determination. Mind over matter. He will not leave this slice of heated heaven.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s five minutes until his bladder emerges victorious. Matter over mind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The cold floor is like ice under Taehyung\u2019s feet as he paddles over to the bathroom. He takes an extra hot shower to soothe his frazzled nerves. The warm water is like a dream, making him linger far longer than is necessary. When the stream starts to turn colder, Taehyung rushes back to the bedroom, stealing one of Jeongguk\u2019s boxers and slipping back into the sweats and t-shirt Jeongguk borrowed him before complimenting his outfit with one of the thousand hoodies Jeongguk has hanging in his closet. A wicked grin flashes across Taehyung\u2019s features as he spots a set of\u00a0<em>Iron Man\u00a0</em>socks and confiscates those as well.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Safely bundled up, Taehyung finally notices a torn piece of paper on the bedside dresser, its blank surface littered with Jeongguk\u2019s chicken scratches. Jeongguk usually communicates via a keyboard, that much is obvious.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>Gone for a run. Tried to tell you but you seemed comatose.</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung frowns. Zero points for romance.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>DON\u2019T eat in my bed!!</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Rude much?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The ink on the next line is a bit thicker than before, like Jeongguk had hesitated before writing it down.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<em>X Guk</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A smile blooms across Taehyung\u2019s face as a warmth starts to uncurl and flutter in his chest. Cute. Jeongguk is cute. Taehyung can almost imagine him writing it, Jeongguk fiercely debating whether or not to add something as small but telling as that. Jeongguk was always a notoriously bad texter during their hook-ups, often only sending Taehyung one or two word messages; locations and times, dozens of messages that consisted only of the letter\u00a0<em>\u2018K\u2019</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is still smiling as he makes his way to the kitchen. He\u2019d show Jeongguk how it\u2019s done and resolves to clutter his next text to Jeongguk with enough flashing hearts and moving emoticons to make Jeongguk\u2019s phone light up like a Christmas tree. Taehyung can almost taste Jeongguk\u2019s embarrassment already. How sweet.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Sorting through the leftover Chinese food, Taehyung pick two cartons. He doesn\u2019t care what other people say, it\u2019s even better the next day. For a moment, Taehyung considers eating it in the bed (because he can just as much of a little shit as Jeongguk is) but with no small amount of self-discipline, Taehyung decides to be a better person and behave himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Reheated food in one hand, Taehyung turns on the television and nestles on the couch, seriously contemplating bringing over the duvet from Jeongguk\u2019s bedroom but feeling too lazy to actually follow through on that thought. Why is Jeongguk\u2019s apartment like a snow fortress?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung barely finished his food when there\u2019s noise coming from the front door, metal sliding over metal as a key is turned, followed by Jeongguk\u2019s return to the apartment. His cheeks are rosy from the cold, making Taehyung want to pinch and kiss them, and his eyes are big and round as they take in Taehyung on the couch. His posture is coloured with Jeongguk\u2019s usual air of nonchalance but Taehyung now knows him well enough to catch little flickers of other emotions under that mask of indifference. Relief, surprise\u2026happiness?</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">All of a sudden, Taehyung feels like he passed some sort of test. Jeongguk\u2019s test of Taehyung\u2019s feelings because Taehyung isn\u2019t quite sure if people can even go for a proper run in this cold and snow. What if Jeongguk\u2019s departure had been his way of giving Taehyung an exit? An opportunity to leave unseen? Part of Taehyung smarts at the idea of how uncertain Jeongguk still feels about Taehyung\u2019s commitment but another part rejoices at seeing how pleased Jeongguk is at the fact that Taehyung is still there. Jeongguk is cute indeed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGukkie,\u201d Taehyung exclaims with enough melodrama to make the students in the theatre department reel with envy, arms up like he\u2019s desperately reaching out for Jeongguk. \u201cYou\u2019re back. I thought I was going to freeze to death when you were gone.\u201d Taehyung waves his hand about the room. \u201cHow could you leave me alone in this icy fortress of solitude?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk rolls his eyes but his face is also engraved with amusement at Taehyung\u2019s antics, just the way Taehyung likes it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHeating is a bitch,\u201d Jeongguk says as he begins to fiddle with the thermostat. \u201cThis thing doesn\u2019t work properly anymore, so you got to turn it up really high.\u201d His eyebrows knot together in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019ve called my landlord all fucking week but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll drag his ass here until I set the place on fire.\u201d Suddenly the pipes start to groan and rattle like some great beast in the wall just awoke from his sleep. \u201cShould get warmer soon.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung lets his body lean forward even further over the back of the couch. \u201cHow was your run?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFine. They cleared the main road running past the university of snow, so it was okay.\u201d Jeongguk pulls his shirt over his head, revealing a stomach that makes Taehyung want to release an obscene sound of appreciation but he manages to control his baser impulses. \u201cGonna take a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods, mouth watering a little with a hunger that has nothing to do with the Chinese food as he watches Jeongguk disappear towards the bedroom. There\u2019s barely time for Taehyung to refocus his attention on the television before Jeongguk returns much earlier than expected. But Taehyung can\u2019t say he minds when Jeongguk joins him on the couch, black hair still a little damp.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Without hesitation, Taehyung pounds upon Jeongguk like he\u2019s prey, happily draping himself over the lap of another warm body. It\u2019s a little silly, they\u2019re both grown men with Taehyung being maybe a bit more slender of frame but also an inch taller than Jeongguk, yet he fits so perfectly there.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGod, Gukkie,\u201d Taehyung almost moans against Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, nose catching wind of Jeongguk\u2019s shampoo; something woody and masculine and fantastic. \u201cYou\u2019re so hot.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFunny you should say that because I feel kind of cold,\u201d Jeongguk mutters darkly, eyebrow piercing raised and shimmering with what looks like a reprimand. \u201cThere was hardly any hot water left.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feigns a little noise of surprise. \u201cHow peculiar.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk agrees. \u201cHow peculiar.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung attacks him his most blinding rectangular smile, softly wheezing with a mostly unapologetic giggle as he sneaks an arm around Jeongguk\u2019s neck. \u201cWe can cuddle to keep warm.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk grumbles a little, so Taehyung ups his charm offensive by dropping a gentle kiss on Jeongguk\u2019s cheek. Jeongguk\u2019s irritation immediately thaws out, the grip of his arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist tightening adoringly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The manner in which Jeongguk\u2019s cheek dust with the slightest hint of pink and how his eyes soften makes butterflies explode in Taehyung\u2019s abdomen. Taehyung still knows how to play cute and Jeongguk is still his favourite victim but it\u2019s different now. Jeongguk seems so confident and mature in some ways; the tattoos, his own apartment, the way he fucks like a god. But Taehyung realizes now that the times he thought he was stroking Jeongguk\u2019s big bad boy ego, he was actually praising a young man who was insecure and longing for his affection. Taehyung could live with that. He\u2019d drown Jeongguk in it if he would let him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And Jeongguk isn\u2019t the only one insecure. Taehyung is clingy, unable to control it now that they\u2019ve confessed, crawling into Jeongguk\u2019s body because he\u2019s aching to be near. And Taehyung finds himself waiting for the other shoe to drop, just like he was waiting for it yesterday evening when they cuddled and made out on the couch for hours before going to bed. Waiting for Jeongguk to tell him he needs a little space to breathe and for Taehyung to take it easy because Taehyung\u2019s constant care is starting to become stifling. Just like all of his previous boyfriends did.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Jeongguk doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They watch anime together instead, their bodies a mess of tangled limbs, Taehyung\u2019s body crispy and toasty in Jeongguk\u2019s arms but his heart feeling even warmer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t know how long they sit together like this, his eyelids eventually starting to droop like he might doze off again, but then Jeongguk\u2019s voice breaks the silence, the man\u2019s chest a pleasing rumble behind Taehyung\u2019s back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDid you tell anyone yet?\u201d Jeongguk asks the vague question with a false nonchalance he fails so epically at that Taehyung has to try his hardest not to laugh at his face. He\u2019s proud of himself when he doesn\u2019t because Jeongguk sounds like he\u2019s been working up the courage to ask that question ever since they\u2019ve been sitting on that couch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung says, hand reaching back to brush reassuringly through Jeongguk\u2019s hair. \u201cPosted something in the group app before going to bed last night.\u201d Taehyung had read his friends\u2019 responses that morning when scarfing down the leftover Chinese. \u201cJimin said we\u2019re not allowed to have sex at the dorm because you have your own apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk scoffs a little like he usually does at the mention of Jimin\u2019s name.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe\u2019ll arrive at the station this Sunday at three, so if we go over to the dorm at that time, we could be up and running in all our naked glory by the time he gets back to our dorm room.\u201d Taehyung leans his head back to underline his statement with a lascivious wink and Jeongguk chuckles in response.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if I can get it up knowing that Jimin is just around the corner.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung kisses his teeth, a disappointed sound hissing past his lips. \u201cAmateur.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk immediately pinches his side in revenge, making Taehyung laugh and flail about helplessly until he apologizes by acknowledging Jeongguk as a \u2018<em>Sex God\u2019\u00a0</em>and Jeongguk\u2019s fingers stop tickling his ribcage with teasing touches.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re both still grinning as Taehyung falls back against Jeongguk\u2019s chest. \u201cHoseok hyung spammed the app with like a thousand hearts and kissing emoticons.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shakes his head. \u201cHe\u2019s always spamming the dance app as well. Kind of hard to take him serious that way.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThis is how normal people are supposed to text, Gukkie. They invented moving stickers for a reason,\u201d Taehyung explains with an exasperated sigh, like it\u2019s common knowledge and all people should communicate by means of flashy emoticons instead of actual words. Taehyung is a strong advocate on the matter. \u201cBut he also said that I\u2019m not allowed to talk about your dick.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrow shoots up, piercing vanishing far beneath his fringe. \u201cWhy would he say that?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo reason,\u201d Taehyung says while flapping his hands through the air in a nonsensical gesture, the way his voice lilts unconvincingly making Jeongguk snort disbelievingly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cAnyways,\u201d Taehyung says, changing the subject rather conspicuously. \u201cSeokjin hyung said that he wants me to bring you over for dinner soon.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDinner?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah.\u201d Taehyung taps his chin in thought. \u201cI know it\u2019s quick but it\u2019s not like I can say no to my mom shark, so we\u2019ll just have to go and face the inquisition.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAt least there\u2019ll be good food.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk looks at him with a forehead full of creases. \u201cYou do know that what you just said makes absolutely no sense to me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cPatience, my little bunny,\u201d Taehyung says as he softly pats Jeongguk\u2019s cheek like he\u2019s a little kid. \u201cEverything will become clear in the end.\u201d Jeongguk sullenly scrunches his nose up, so Taehyung turns his slightly condescending petting into a soft caress across Jeongguk\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMe?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice is laced with genuine question. It\u2019s glaringly obvious that Jeongguk doesn\u2019t completely comprehend yet that relationships are a two-way street but Taehyung doesn\u2019t care. They could work on that. Jeongguk had never really dated before.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah.\u00a0<em>You.</em>\u00a0Did you tell anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk tilts his head and Taehyung can tell the thought hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind yet, so focused on Taehyung and whether he was still trying to keep Jeongguk a secret from his friends that he hadn\u2019t even told anyone himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Jeongguk eventually admits. \u201cI mean, I told my brother once, via Skype, that I\u2014\u201d there\u2019s a slight blush creeping up Jeongguk\u2019s face and Taehyung can feel his insides twist with pleasure \u201c\u2014that I liked someone. And Yoongi hyung figured something was going on that time you dropped off my phone. But I\u2026I didn\u2019t text anyone you stayed over last night.\u201d Jeongguk kneads the back of his own neck in consideration, scrunching up his nose again. \u201cThat would be weird.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung snorts a little in glee. Of course, because tough guys with tattoos don\u2019t talk about stuff like that and they definitely don\u2019t bombard each other at night with texts about their crushes that are illustrated with moving stickers like twelve-year-old girls. Taehyung shrugs. Their loss, obviously.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWhat do you want me to tell them?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s piercing gaze connects with Taehyung\u2019s, his face schooled into that neutral, guarded expression that Taehyung hopes will appear less and less frequently in the future. It feels like another test. A question behind a question.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI told my friends that we made up,\u201d Taehyung says, choosing his words carefully. \u201cI told them that we confessed to liking each other and that I was staying the night.\u201d Taehyung takes a deep breath, shifting a little awkwardly between Jeongguk\u2019s legs. He thought they'd cleared everything up last night but now he still felt a little insecure when actually putting it into words. He thought they'd said\u00a0<em>said\u00a0</em>it already but they hadn\u2019t. Not really. His next words come out rushed, \u201cI told them that we were dating and that you\u2019re my boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The following second seems to last an eternity. Taehyung suddenly worries if he'd jumped the gun. Did Jeongguk maybe not feel this way? Did he want to take it slower? Did he want to do casual dating before an actual relationship? A sudden anxiety begins to seep into cracks of his recent happiness, threatening to freeze it over and kill it like a spring flower that tried to blossom prematurely, but then Jeongguk nods with a small smile, all bunny teeth and big eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah, you\u2019re my boyfriend,\u201d Jeongguk agrees and Taehyung\u2019s lips are on his in an instant, swallowing the final syllables.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Kissing Jeongguk the boyfriend is a hundred times better than kissing Jeongguk the casual hook-up. It tastes sweet when Jeongguk dips his tongue in Taehyung\u2019s mouth like he\u2019s there to stay, it feels secure when Jeongguk\u2019s hand fans out over his lower back to pull him closer like he never wants to let Taehyung go. The little whimpers that escape their lips sound sensuous like always but now they\u2019re also grounding. This is real. This is theirs. Taehyung can\u2019t get enough and neither can Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The next hour, the anime show plays forgotten in the background. Taehyung never thought he could feel this way but he can\u2019t think of a single thing more interesting than kissing Jeon Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The rest of the day passes in a similar fashion. They remain holed up in Jeongguk\u2019s apartment, hidden away from the cold and the world outside while eating, watching television shows, kissing, or just talking. Taehyung wonders if it\u2019s telling for how their relationship would progress in the future, if they were going to turn into one of those boring couch potato couples, but he honestly can\u2019t bring himself to care. He likes this. He likes Jeongguk and he doesn\u2019t need anything else.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Somewhere around nine at night, Jeongguk is spread out over the couch, feet dangling off one of the armrests while new food cartons litter the coffee table because they ordered fried chicken. Taehyung would feel guilty about their piss-poor diet but Jeongguk claims he can cook and promised to demonstrate his skills tomorrow, something Taehyung is excitedly looking forward to.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung swings one leg over Jeongguk\u2019s waist to straddle him and feels exuberantly pleased with how Jeongguk\u2019s hands shoot up to steady his hips like it\u2019s second nature. Jeongguk\u2019s shirt has twisted with his movements, caught strangely beneath his back, and Taehyung can see the fine lines of the tattoo across his clavicle peaking up from beneath the collar. Taehyung caresses the inked skin with the finger tops of two slender digits. Jeongguk\u2019s eyes immediately shoot upwards, dark orbs full of question.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d Taehyung says in a soft voice, fingers dipping under the rim of the shirt to trace the entire length of the tattoo. They hadn\u2019t talked about them yet, not since Jeongguk had accused Taehyung of being too scared to ask what they mean during their fight before Christmas break. Taehyung pulls the shirt down a little, trying to read the foreign lettering.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Life: It Goes On</em>,\u201d Jeongguk answers Taehyung\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cFirst tattoo I ever got.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI thought that\u2019s what it meant.\u201d Taehyung hesitates briefly, biting his bottom lip. \u201cWhy did you pick it?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJust to remind myself at times.\u201d Jeongguk shrugs nonchalantly, eyes darting back to the television, but Taehyung can tell by how taut Jeongguk\u2019s body feels beneath his legs that he isn\u2019t as relaxed as he pretends to be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung traces the inked skin one final time. It\u2019s not as poetic and hopeful as tattoos often are, no\u00a0<em>\u2018Believe\u2019</em>\u00a0or\u00a0<em>\u2018What Doesn\u2019t Kill You Makes You Stronger\u2019</em>. Jeongguk\u2019s tattoo is the undeniable truth of the matter inked into his skin. Blunt and harsh. Taehyung thinks it suits Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just as Taehyung mentally prepares to fall down beside Jeongguk, calculating how to best nestle himself against his boyfriend\u2019s side like the lazy bums they\u2019ve become, Jeongguk bends up at the waist to pull his shirt off over his head. He falls back on the couch bare-chested, carelessly tossing the garment on the floor. The stomach Taehyung had been lusting over that morning, and many times before that, is on glorious display beneath him, the tattoos now clearly visible.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung reaches out for the smooth skin on instinct but stops himself at the last moment, fingers hovering in the air as he looks at Jeongguk, asking permission without words. Jeongguk grants it to him by encasing his hand with his own and pushing it down towards his chest, squeezing briefly before folding his arm under his head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The skin is hot and soft beneath Taehyung\u2019s touch, a soft current seeming to buzz where they\u2019re joined without clothing to separate them. Taehyung sighs in muted pleasure as he moves his hand downwards, fingers caressing the stretch of skin over Jeongguk\u2019s heart. The ache to kiss that tattoo is often the strongest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Passion Brings Light,</em>\u201d Jeongguk says, words slow and weighted. Taehyung feels he\u2019s being let in on a secret, on something important. And he is. Anything that matters enough for Jeongguk to permanently put on his skin is of significance to Taehyung. \u201cThere was a period in my life when I wasn\u2019t passionate about anything. It felt like living in a black pit that grew darker each day. I think the absence of passion kills.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung had never thought about things like that. He\u2019s happy and he supposes he\u2019s passionate. He loves science and working in the lab. Then he thinks of Jimin and how miserable his best friend is in his classes and how happy drawing makes him. Maybe Jeongguk is right. Taehyung has been trying for ages to get Jimin to switch his major.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s what I originally wanted get there,\u201d Jeongguk continues; \u201c<em>The Absence of Passion Kills</em>, but my tattoo artist wore me down with a half hour speech about how it\u2019s more motivating to phrase the message positively.\u201d Jeongguk jokingly rolls his eyes. \u201cSo now it\u2019s;\u00a0<em>Passion Brings Light</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung lays a flat hand on Jeongguk\u2019s heart, trying to feel it beat beneath his fingers. \u201cEven if life just goes on?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shrugs. \u201cI guess there\u2019s a difference between living and merely existing.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung moves downwards even further, fingers kissing the tattoo on Jeongguk\u2019s side. It\u2019s the only piece with colour, dark blues and hints of white mingling in with the black and grey.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMagpie,\u201d Jeongguk explains. \u201cMy mother\u2019s favourite bird.\u201d It\u2019s a side profile of the bird in mid-flap, its wings behind it and slightly bend. There\u2019s motion in the image; life. \u201cThey\u2019re not the prettiest of birds but they\u2019re very intelligent and they have a weakness for shiny things. My mother used to say she could relate to that.\u201d Jeongguk grins wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s also supposed to be a symbol for good luck.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Taehyung whispers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cShe was a beautiful woman despite what she sometimes thought,\u201d Jeongguk says, eyes sad and the hurt there makes Taehyung\u2019s chest ache uncomfortably. \u201cBeautiful and smart.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods. Looking at Jeongguk, it\u2019s not hard to believe those words. Taehyung soothingly brushes his hands over Jeongguk\u2019s chest before wrapping them around Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders, trying to console him by touch. When Jeongguk remains silent, Taehyung\u2019s eyes travel to the only other tattoo depicting an animal. He can see part of it curling around Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder and upper arm but most of it is hidden from view, continuing down over Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder blade and part of his back. It\u2019s the largest piece to decorate Jeongguk\u2019s body. \u201cAnd the tiger?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMy father,\u201d Jeongguk says. \u201cAnd me. It represents power and strength.\u201d There\u2019s a fierceness to the image that never fails to captivate Taehyung\u2019s gaze when Jeongguk has his back to him. \u201cDestruction too. It\u2019s a warning.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFor who?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFor me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants to ask more. He wants to decipher Jeongguk\u2019s cryptic words but he also doesn\u2019t want to push. Worrying his bottom lip with his teeth, Taehyung decides to let it go for now. There\u2019s more ink on Jeongguk\u2019s body left to explore. Maybe those lines would be less painful to discuss.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe was a good man,\u201d Jeongguk says, not giving Taehyung the time to move on to a different patch of skin. \u201cStrong and brave. He just\u2026\u201d Jeongguk trails off in a hoarse voice, the words thick and strained with barely held back emotion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Taehyung immediately coos as he gives Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders another squeeze. He locks eyes with Jeongguk, trying to show him he\u2019s there and he isn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it. You don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to. Or if you\u2019re not ready. I can wait.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk says after taking a deep breath, voice more even, but his eyes still red and misty. \u201cI just want you to know I had good parents. I come from good people.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s face twists with worry and anger. \u201cI know people at university talk sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Taehyung immediately says as he bends down to press his lips against Jeongguk\u2019s forehead, kissing away the frown. \u201cI never doubted that.\u201d Taehyung cups Jeongguk\u2019s jaw in both hands, looking at him with fierce intent. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Gukkie.\u201d This time Taehyung briefly presses his lips against Jeongguk\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sure your parents were good people too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cHe used to drink,\u201d Jeongguk blurts out. His eyes widen a little in panic when he realizes what he said. \u201cI mean, he wasn\u2019t an alcoholic or anything,\u201d Jeongguk rushes to explain, hands waving through his hair a little franticly, and Taehyung is torn between trying to reassure Jeongguk he\u2019s not obligated to tell him anything again or just letting Jeongguk get it off his chest. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even drink during the week. But whenever my parents went to a party, he always had that one glass too many. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung nods, making a little humming noise of understanding as he weaves fingers through Jeongguk\u2019s hair and captures Jeongguk\u2019s hand, so Jeongguk can\u2019t torment the dark strands any further.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault. I know it wasn\u2019t. The truck ran a red light but sometimes I still wonder\u2026\u201d Jeongguk bobs his shoulders in a helpless motion, the movement hampered by lying down. \u201cI wonder if maybe his reflexes would have been better if he hadn\u2019t been drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh, Gukkie,\u201d Taehyung almost sighs, clutching Jeongguk\u2019s hand even tighter in the hope it might take away some of the pain. His heart aches at the thought of the amount of torment Jeongguk objects himself too. The misery he inflicts upon the memory of his father.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk whispers, casting his eyes downwards like a child who's been chastised. \u201cJunghyun hyung gets mad when I say that. He says I shouldn\u2019t talk about dad like that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI think,\u201d Taehyung says in a gentle voice, trying to find the right words, \u201cthat you just really wish your parents were still here.\u201d Jeongguk flinches, eyes filled with an anguish that Taehyung knows he can never fully understand because he\u2019s lucky enough to have both his parents in good health. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d Jeongguk doesn\u2019t respond, so Taehyung brushes his thumb over his cheek. \u201cIf you ever want to talk and you think your brother won\u2019t understand, you can talk to me.\u201d Taehyung cradles Jeongguk\u2019s face with both hands, making sure the man beneath him can see the promise in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk nods, diverting his gaze to the television screen and Taehyung takes note of the silent cue, letting himself fall down to the couch, settling on his side into the nook between the back of the couch and Jeongguk\u2019s body. As the minutes pass, Taehyung can feel Jeongguk\u2019s body relax beside him, Jeongguk\u2019s breathing evening out and becoming calm and deep again. All the while, Taehyung absentmindedly runs his fingers over the exposed expanses of skin, lips brushing against Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. Unconsciously, Taehyung curves and moulds himself to Jeongguk\u2019s body, like the ocean bending to towards the moon.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Somewhere far into his instinctive exploration, Taehyung\u2019s hand slides down Jeongguk\u2019s muscular arm until he reaches Jeongguk\u2019s wrist. Taehyung briefly thumbs at his pulse point before moving up Jeongguk\u2019s arm a little until he finds the small tattoo of a two headed arrow. It\u2019s a collection of just five lines, the arrow depicted in its most abstract form, the head facing in the direction of Jeongguk\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYoongi hyung made me get it. As a reminder to not get too stuck in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is not quite sure how to respond. He didn\u2019t mean to redirect their conversation back to more tattoos. \u201cI guess that\u2019s not a bad reminder,\u201d he eventually settles on.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Jeongguk agrees. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d Jeongguk lifts his other wrist. \u201cHe\u2019s on here too. One of the dots.\u201d Taehyung observes the line of three dots on Jeongguk wrist, starting below the palm and moving up Jeongguk\u2019s arm. \u201cPeople that helped me after my parent\u2019s death. Yoongi hyung, my brother, and me.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou helped you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou can\u2019t rely on someone else for everything.\u201d Jeongguk wipes his fringe of his forehead. His voice sounds even and collected when talking about the smaller tattoos, like the strong person he always acts to be. \u201cIt\u2019s just another reminder. They\u2019re all reminders.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung feels small under Jeongguk\u2019s gaze, his eyes mature and more experienced, despite being two years younger. Like Taehyung\u2019s quirky behaviour is extra frivolous compared to the thought that went behind all of Jeongguk\u2019s inked skin. Jeongguk is not always the best with words but his tattoos show just how deep Jeongguk\u2019s waters run.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung trails his fingers across the tattoo peeking out just above Jeongguk\u2019s jeans and watches Jeongguk's abdomen contract just as it always does, desperate to lighten some of the tension. \u201cPlease tell me this doesn\u2019t represent a person. I\u2019ve licked it more times than I can count.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk snickers, eyes dancing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that\u2019s just a collection of aesthetically pleasing looking lines.\u201d Taehyung raises an eyebrow. \u201cI lost a bet once when I was drunk,\u201d Jeongguk continues, \u201cand Yoongi hyung made me get a tattoo on my hipbone because it hurts like hell and his soul is as black and worn out as that stupid leather jacket he always wears.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung chuckles, glad to see Jeongguk\u2019s face painted with something other than hurt again. \u201cYou two really have an interesting friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk hums in agreement and smirks. \u201cBut it\u2019s his loss in the end because it makes for a great focal point during sex.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grins. \u201cThat it does.\u201d Taehyung then leaves the tattoo on the hipbone in peace and swing his arm around Jeongguk\u2019s waist. \u201cDo you want more?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMaybe.\u201d Jeongguk brushes his hand over the bicep resting against Taehyung\u2019s chest. \u201cOn my arms perhaps. But I want it to have meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMaybe you should get something a bit more light-hearted,\u201d Taehyung begins to tease, \u201clike\u00a0<em>Iron Man</em>.\u201d Jeongguk rolls his eyes towards the ceiling but that only encourages Taehyung. \u201cOr a dirty joke. That\u2019s a fun icebreaker.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s face seems to battle between exasperation and amusement, so Taehyung continues, eager to see him laugh. \u201cI know, you should get a Sudoku puzzle. A really difficult one. One of those with a five-star rating because that would be fun after sex.\u201d When that doesn\u2019t do it, Taehyung brings in the big guns. \u201cOr my face. My face is like a work of art; it never goes out of style.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That finally cracks Jeongguk. \u201cShut up,\u201d he says between his chuckles. \u201cAnything but your face.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGukkie!\u201d Taehyung gasps in mock offense. \u201cHow can you even say that?\u201d He cups his own chin with one hand. \u201cArt, I tell you.\u201d Jeongguk just keeps laughing and Taehyung starts to snicker as well. \u201cNevermind. I don\u2019t want you to tattoo my face anyway. It will just get ugly as you grow old and fat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Jeongguk shrouds himself in his trademark blas\u00e9 demeanour but Taehyung knows much better than to fall for that again. Jeongguk does care. He\u2019s very much bothered by the opinions of others. \u201cThe tattoos put most people off anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true,\u201d Taehyung retorts. \u201cI think most people are just surprised.\u201d He swings a leg over Jeongguk\u2019s hips, cuddling even closer. \u201cI was surprised even though I really like them. It\u2019s a lot of ink for someone as young as you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk acknowledges. \u201cI blasted through a large part of my inheritance with this apartment and getting the tattoos done.\u201d He sighs. \u201cNot to mention that I spent a lot of my free time in a chair or on a bench in a tattoo shop. The back piece hasn\u2019t been finished for more than a few weeks. I got the final session in when we weren\u2019t talking for a month.\u201d Jeongguk averts his eyes like he\u2019d rather not think of that anymore. \u201cBefore our fight and Christmas break.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI thought I noticed as much but you were sitting with your back towards the couch and\u2026\u201d Taehyung gives a little weak shrug, cheeks flushing with embarrassment when thinking back on that moment and the blowjob he gave Jeongguk on the exact same couch they're now lying on. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the guts to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk responds with a similar shrug, like it doesn\u2019t matter. Like he\u2019s no longer bothered with how Taehyung dodged personal conversations in the past. \u201cMy brother thinks I\u2019m an idiot. But the pain and\u2014and having them on my body; it\u2019s cathartic somehow.\u201d He places his arm under his head again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Makes me feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Taehyung says, angling his body over Jeongguk who is starting to feel a bit cold to the touch without his shirt on. \u201cEveryone deals with stuff in their own way. You could be doing a lot worse than getting inked up.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk murmurs in agreement, a hand slipping under Taehyung\u2019s shirt to stroke Taehyung\u2019s back in idle circles, the caress making Taehyung want to purr and curl up like a cat basking in the sun. Taehyung feels so warm. So at home.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">That night, Taehyung kisses each line of ink, each curl and swirl covering Jeongguk\u2019s body and the unblemished stretches in between. Taehyung\u2019s lips worship the scar on Jeongguk\u2019s cheek and the ones on his legs and arms from where Jeongguk always hurts himself when dancing. Because Taehyung adores every piece of Jeongguk, even the imperfections and the pieces that have been broken and put together again; the ridges of Jeongguk\u2019s mind and personality that are rough around the edges.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t like Jeongguk in spite of them. Or because of them. Taehyung likes Jeongguk and that includes every part of him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung knows he can\u2019t stop until Jeongguk finally believes that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The coming weeks, Taehyung discovers just how much he likes Jeongguk. He discovers that he really does. So, so much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But sometimes Jeongguk just makes it so hard to like him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like right now, when Taehyung is wearing formfitting jeans, has his hair done up in a casual <em>somebody clutched at it during sex and now I look gloriously fucked</em> kind of manner, and is wearing eyeliner. Actual eyeliner. He looks good. He knows he does because the people at the club hadn\u2019t been able to keep his eyes off him. Jeongguk had known it too, hands all over him, lips sucking possessive hickeys of ownership into the skin of his neck. Right there in public to the great dismay of their friends.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But alas, that smouldering fire back in the club had been extinguished by what Jeongguk considers an apparent disaster in his social life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung sighs. He takes in Jeongguk\u2019s broad shoulders resting against the back of the couch, black hair moved to the sides, exposing his forehead and that pierced eyebrow that never fails to drive Taehyung wild. If Taehyung didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d call Jeongguk\u2019s aesthetic: <em>sexy brooding in a tall, dark stranger kind of way.</em> But he\u2019s better informed than that, so he knows that <em>sulky kid</em> is a far more accurate description.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk turns to look up at him, corners of his lips turned down and eyebrows furrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t think there\u2019s <em>really</em> anything going on there, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Seriously? Taehyung is standing before him in a shirt without holes. Without his trademark holes, that\u2019s the extraordinary lengths he\u2019s willing to go to for Jeongguk, and Jeongguk lacks the common courtesy to eye fuck him the way Taehyung obviously deserves after the monumental struggle he\u2019s had with that horrible stick of eyeliner.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung suppresses the urge to sigh again. Barely. He tilts his head, offering an unsure, \u201cMaybe?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And by \u2018<em>maybe\u2019</em> Taehyung means an all resounding yes. Of course there\u2019s <em>something</em> going on considering Jeongguk\u2019s <em>\u2018there\u2019</em> refers to accidently finding two of their friends sucking face in one of the stingy bathroom stalls of the club they\u2019ve just gotten back from. Sucking face and sucking God only knows what else. If there's any deeply felt emotion behind the sucking of various body parts is not yet clear to Taehyung, but he's planning on subjecting his best friend to a thorough interrogation at a later time.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk groans like Taehyung just kneed him in the gut, shoulders slumping in misery. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants to echo that sentiment. Curse Jimin and his horrible timing. Things had been going so well back in the club with Jeongguk skilfully gyrating his hips into Taehyung\u2019s, hinting at an evening full of dark promises.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But seeing Jimin\u2019s hand down his precious Yoongi hyung\u2019s pants seemed to have put a definite damper on Jeongguk\u2019s usually relentless horniness. However, Taehyung won\u2019t be defeated that easily. He won\u2019t give up on what he felt back at the club; Jeongguk\u2019s thighs hot and heavy between his legs, hands hungrily gripping his waist.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Goal firmly in mind, Taehyung makes his way to the couch and straddles Jeongguk\u2019s lap, caging Jeongguk with his legs and the arms he slips around Jeongguk\u2019s neck. Jeongguk\u2019s hands automatically enclose themselves around the curve of Taehyung\u2019s ass, briefly tightening to cup an admiring feel. Taehyung doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s a completely conscious action on Jeongguk\u2019s part but it\u2019s encouraging nonetheless.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Gently pushing some escaped strands of hair off Jeongguk\u2019s forehead, Taehyung asks, \u201cWhy are you so upset? This could be a good thing. Maybe Yoongi hyung will have less time to boss you around if he\u2019s hanging out with Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk shrugs, eyebrow furrowing even further, obviously unable to see the bright side.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can feel a little sliver of impishness creep into his features, ready to poke a bit of fun at Jeongguk\u2019s childish sulkiness. \u201cMaybe the four of us can go on double dates. That should be fun.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s face fills with so much horror that Taehyung would almost feel bad. Almost. But not really, so deep giggles shake his frame instead. Jeongguk\u2019s hands immediately grab Taehyung\u2019s thighs and start to push, trying to dislodge Taehyung from his lap. Expecting this reaction, Taehyung tightens the grip of his legs and arms, clinging to Jeongguk like an obnoxious octopus as he buries his laughter in Jeongguk\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk eventually gives up, settling on delivering a vengeful pinch to Taehyung\u2019s ass, only making Taehyung laugh even harder. \u201cGod,\u201d Jeongguk grunts. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cBut you luuuuuvvv me,\u201d Taehyung drawls against his skin, placing a mollifying kiss there before coming up to look at Jeongguk with twinkling eyes. Jeongguk looks at him with a slightly pained expression, indicating that he probably does love Taehyung even though he\u2019s kind of wishing he didn\u2019t right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou two can come to pick us up at the dorm in matching tuxes,\u201d Taehyung continues enthusiastically, Jeongguk\u2019s cringing only spurring him on even further. After Christmas break, Taehyung moved back into the dorm with Jimin but he still sees Jeongguk almost every day, often eating together during lunch, sleeping over at least twice a week. Jeongguk occasionally swinging by unexpectedly in the morning to walk him to class or the lab might be one of Taehyung\u2019s favourite things in the world. \u201cAnd bring us flowers and chocolate.\u201d Jeongguk creases up his nose like he just smelled something bad. \u201cMaybe take us on a gondola ride during sunset.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cA gondola ride?\u201d Jeongguk splutters incredulously, having reached his limit. \u201cDo they even have those here?\u201d He releases a mocking huff. \u201cWhat horrible romantic comedy do you live in exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung grins, placing a peck on Jeongguk\u2019s nose. \u201cFind me a gondola ride and I promise to love you forever.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk raises an eyebrow. \u201cForever, huh?\u201d Taehyung nods gleefully. \u201cBut only if we take Yoongi hyung and Jimin too?\u201d Taehyung nods again, eyes scrunching up and lips parting in his rectangular smile. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk twangs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just settle for forever minus a day.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cForever minus a day,\u201d Taehyung murmurs, warmth uncurling in his chest. \u201cAren\u2019t you confident.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk merely smiles smugly in return. He is growing confident. About Taehyung. About them. He no longer seems to wonder if Taehyung will be at his side if he needs him and is just starting to expect he will instead. Much like Taehyung no longer doubts to find Jeongguk holding his hands when he\u2019s sad or insecure. They\u2019re both growing confident.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But apparently Jeongguk still has one or two things he\u2019s worried about. Something outside the scope of their love life and more into the scope of someone else\u2019s. Jeongguk looks up at him with those big, black, bunny eyes that do funny things to Taehyung\u2019s insides. His voice is adorably serious as he asks, \u201cDo you think Yoongi hyung is going to make me call Jimin hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung looks at him, mouth slack, before erupting in an absolutely thunderous laugh. Jeongguk starts pushing him off his lap again in irritation but his attempts are feeble at best, more or less done out of principle and without actual grit, and Taehyung is able to hold on despite the way his muscles are wrecked with laughter. Even almost falling on his ass can\u2019t kill his joy at Jeongguk\u2019s expense and he clutches at his stomach that feels like it\u2019s being painfully forced into a six-pack by laughing alone. It takes several minutes until Taehyung hiccups his final shaky chuckles and wipes a few escaped tears from his eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung turns his attention back on his increasingly irritable boyfriend. \u201cIs this why you\u2019re so cranky? You think Jimin is going to use Yoongi hyung to get back at you?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNo,\u201d Jeongguk is quick to deny, but Taehyung sees something that isn\u2019t quite fear as it is uneasiness flicker across Jeongguk\u2019s face. His Jeongguk\u2019s face. The face of that though, strong man with all the tattoos whom\u00a0half the campus would avoid if they ran into him in a poorly lit street. That man who\u2019s rough around the edges, a little callous when he feels cornered and upset, who pretends to not need anyone\u2019s approval yet shines so bright when being praised. Who goes so soft when it\u2019s Taehyung who tells him how important he is. How much he matters.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A few more wheezing giggles escape Taehyung but he\u2019s quick to curb the rest when Jeongguk shoots him a look that could kill.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Taehyung coos. Looking down at Jeongguk with mischief dancing in his eyes, he wraps his arms back around Jeongguk\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cOh, please,\u201d Jeongguk scoffs deprecatingly. \u201cYou\u2019re way too scared of Yoongi hyung. Last week you spotted him in the corner and almost jumped a foot into the air.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Taehyung protests immediately. \u201cI just didn\u2019t see him there. He can be so quiet sometimes. What was he doing in the corner anyway? Just looming there\u2014\u201d Taehyung shivers a little at the memory \u201c\u2014like some kind of pale angel of Death.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk snorts derisively. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound scared at all.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Taehyung denies petulantly. And he isn\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s a little intimidated by the pink haired man but that has more to do with the fact that he\u2019s almost like a surrogate brother to Jeongguk. Fortunately, Taehyung is quite sure that the older man may find him a bit peculiar (as most people do) but also appreciates of how happy Jeongguk looks around Taehyung. The unspoken promise Taehyung made in his mind to Yoongi to take good care of Jeongguk weighs on Taehyung\u2019s shoulders like a comfortable coat he doesn\u2019t ever want to part with.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung squints his eyes into crescents as his lips part to give way to a teasing rectangular smile. \u201cAnd seeing Jimin trying to eat off Yoongi hyung\u2019s face after his show did ruin his street cred a little bit. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll jump the next time he\u2019s hiding in the corner.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cWonderful,\u201d Jeongguk mutters. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cStop worrying,\u201d Taehyung says with a snigger. He places an affectionate kiss alongside Jeongguk\u2019s jawline, his lips lingering briefly. It\u2019s so sharp that Taehyung sometimes wonders how he hasn\u2019t cut himself on it yet. \u201cIf Jimin decides to use his manly wiles for evil, you can always enlist the help of Seokjin hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk raises that pierced eyebrow. \u201cYou really think Yoongi hyung will care about Seokjin hyung butting in?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now it\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s turn to scoff. \u201cPlease, your grumpy grandpa is no match for my mom shark.\u201d Jeongguk rolls his eyes at that but Taehyung can see the corners of his lips quirk slightly with the beginning of a smirk. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re Seokjin hyung\u2019s new favourite because you\u2019re the only one he deems worthy of being his kitchen disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk actually smiles a little at that and the sight causes familiar flutters low in Taehyung\u2019s abdomen. Taehyung had never suspected Jeongguk and Seokjin would get along that well. Seokjin with his immaculate dress shirts and distaste for foul language yet he seemed to have taken Jeongguk under his wing, thrilled at finally having found someone who shares his interest in cooking.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In fact, somehow their ragtag group of friends meshed surprisingly well, falling together like they were meant to be, despite they\u2019re seemingly diverging interests and personalities. Just last week they all had dinner together for the first time, Hoseok and Yoongi talking about music for hours, Jeongguk and Seokjin cooking dinner, Jimin <em>squabbling</em> with Yoongi (in a somewhat convoluted mating dance apparently), and Taehyung ending up evicted from the kitchen indefinitely for prematurely stuffing his face with what turned out to be essential ingredients and almost ruining diner. Taehyung still felt somewhat sore about that. Jeongguk and Seokjin hadn\u2019t been willing to listen to his side of the story at all.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But when seeing Jeongguk\u2019s faint smile right now, Taehyung forgets all about how he was clearly unfairly dismissed from the kitchen, leaning forward like a flower drawn to the sun. Taehyung decides it\u2019s definitely time to move on to more pleasant things. Something that includes more smiling from the both of them, less talk of their friends, and hopefully more moaning. Taehyung licks his bottom lip and sees Jeongguk\u2019s gaze flicker down to follow the movement. Yes, definitely something that involves more moaning.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung moves a little closer, rolling his hips into Jeongguk with determination, and the sudden dark glint in Jeongguk\u2019s eyes lets Taehyung know his boyfriend isn\u2019t oblivious to what Taehyung is doing. Taehyung cocks his head a little, voice dropping to an even hoarser timbre. \u201cDon\u2019t you like the outfit I picked?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk tilts his head as well, mirroring Taehyung, pursing his lips a little like he\u2019s giving it serious thought. \u201cClothes that actually fit you. Without holes as well. I think I remember seeing something similar in a far, far away past but I\u2019ve seen you in so many hideous sweaters by now that I can hardly remember it.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gives Jeongguk a salacious wink. \u201cDug it up from underneath the mothballs just for you, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk smirks and tugs at the red fabric around Taehyung\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this kind of ruins it?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung gasps, trying to imitate one of Hoseok\u2019s iconic offended faces. \u201cIt\u2019s got sentimental value. It\u2019s <em>our </em>red\u00a0scarf.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>My</em> scarf.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou <em>gave</em> it to me, Gukkie.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201c<em>Borrowed</em>,\u201d Jeongguk counters with a grin. He nods towards one of Taehyung\u2019s feet. \u201cThose are an unexpected addition too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung briefly locks eyes with the Iron Man on his left foot. \u201cI washed them and put them in my closet. They\u2019re mine now.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cIs that the way it works,\u201d Jeongguk grin widens, eyes filled with tender playfulness. None of Taehyung\u2019s previous boyfriends ever looked at Taehyung like that. None played along as well as Jeongguk does.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung replies with a boxy grin of his own, pleased at how Jeongguk finally seems to have managed to banish thoughts of Jimin and Yoongi to the darker recesses of his mind, safely locked away. They could stay there until the next time Taehyung felt like torturing his boyfriend for his own amusement. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it works.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk tugs aside Taehyung\u2019s collar before nipping at the newly exposed skin, leaving a faint red mark behind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMine,\u201d Jeongguk declares, eyes dark and full of suggestion as he looks up at Taehyung. The obsidian orbs burn and their heat goes straight to Taehyung\u2019s core.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung bites his lip. That\u2019s better; this evening is back on track.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung strokes his hands down Jeongguk\u2019s side as he places more marks in the crook of Taehyung\u2019s neck, working his way up, feverishly muttering \u2018mine\u2019 into Taehyung\u2019s skin. Reaching Jeongguk\u2019s jeans, Taehyung moves one hand to the centre and squeezes with intent, pleased with the semi-hardness he finds there. Even with the novelty of dating wearing of after a few weeks, Jeongguk\u2019s body is just as responsive to Taehyung as before.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMine,\u201d Taehyung states, squeezing once more for good measure.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cFuck.\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s curse breathes hot against Taehyung\u2019s ear shell. \u201cYou sure are subtle, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cJust making sure you won\u2019t forget,\u201d Taehyung murmurs, voice part teasing and part serious, head dipping low to place his own marks along Jeongguk\u2019s neck. Both could play that game. Taehyung has begun to develop a newfound appreciation for the way Jeongguk always imprints his skin ever since he saw the girl at the coffee shop near Jeongguk\u2019s apartment stare at a particularly vicious hickey Jeongguk had left on the column of his throat. Now gratification twirls warm and slow in his abdomen whenever he sees people staring at either his or Jeongguk\u2019s hickeys, something inside him twisting in contentment when he sees the realization that they\u2019re taken settle in the eyes of the other students at campus.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cNever,\u201d Jeongguk promises in a thick whisper. He underlines his statement by tugging on Taehyung\u2019s earlobe with his teeth, hands massaging the globes of Taehyung\u2019s ass, and Taehyung hears his own breath catch in his throat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung can feel a sudden neediness claw at bones, a desire poisoning his blood so it chars his veins and he rolls his hips down again more desperately. Only Jeongguk gets him on the edge that quickly. Makes him hard that fast.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung leans back to pull his shirt off over his head, huffing a little in indignation when it briefly gets stuck behind his ears, not really used to wearing tightfitting clothes, always forgetting they\u2019re just as much of a pain getting off as they are getting into.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Watching Taehyung struggle in his haste to get naked, makes Jeongguk release a few endeared chuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear that for me, you know,\u201d Jeongguk says as he pulls Taehyung close again. \u201cI like it but I like your artsy fartsy hole-filled sweaters too.\u201d He gives Taehyung one of his serious looks. A look that\u2019s supposed to mitigate all the times he makes fun of Taehyung and his clothing, like he\u2019s suddenly a bit worried Taehyung might not know that he\u2019s joking when he does it. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Taehyung is quick to reassure him. He sits up straight on Jeongguk\u2019s lap, places his hands on his own shoulders and strikes a pose. \u201cYou\u2019re all over these collarbones.\u201d Taehyung sticks out his tongue\u00a0provocatively. \u201cPervert.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking nightmare,\u201d Jeongguk says, groaning despairingly, but there\u2019s an entertained undercurrent to his words that he just can\u2019t quite hide.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is about to launch into a speech about how he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s all of Jeongguk\u2019s dreams come true, when strong arms jostle him up into the air, making nothing but a surprised gasp tumble past his lips instead. There\u2019s no time for protests as Jeongguk connects their lips in a bruising kiss, teeth nipping at Taehyung\u2019s bottom lip as he begins to navigates them to bedroom. This is Jeongguk taking control of the situation and Taehyung lets him, obligingly clinging closer, limbs eagerly wrapped around Jeongguk\u2019s torso. This is what Taehyung had been waiting for all night. This is Jeongguk finally tending to the fire that always crackles between them until it will consume them again with bliss.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It would be a lie to say it\u2019s effortless for Jeongguk to lift them of the couch and carry Taehyung to the bedroom (Taehyung is more robust than his delicate features and normally baggy clothing would suggest) but it\u2019s not really hard on him either. And Taehyung can\u2019t help but revel in Jeongguk\u2019s raw power. He can\u2019t help but burn. Even with their arousal straining almost uncomfortably behind their jeans and between their bodies, he can\u2019t help but rub up against Jeongguk in search for more. Even when his desperate grappling at Jeongguk\u2019s body makes Jeongguk clash their shoulders against the door post with a painful thud, Taehyung can\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is sure he\u2019ll always want more of this. More of Jeongguk. More of the way Jeongguk makes what was already there in Taehyung burn brighter while adding completely new embers to the flame. He makes everything around Taehyung seem so effervescent; all the colours saturated with a poignant vibrancy. Taehyung never wants to go back to the dark. To the grey that didn\u2019t even seem colourless before Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They reach the bed and Jeongguk lets them fall forward until they end up a tangled mess of limbs and breathy chuckles. Jeongguk\u2019s T-shirt disappears but before Taehyung has the chance to run an appreciative gaze over the newly uncovered skin, Jeongguk\u2019s lips are upon his again. Jeongguk tastes so sweet, so hungry, and Taehyung isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s being devoured or if he\u2019s the one swallowing Jeongguk whole. Maybe it\u2019s both. Maybe they\u2019ll consume each other until they\u2019re one. Or maybe until there\u2019s nothing left.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Unable to see, Taehyung resorts to worshipping with his hands instead, long fingers kneading the strong planes and muscles of Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders and back, nails racking across the dark lines of inks he now knows by heart. Jeongguk does the same, coarse finger pads skimming over the dips and lines of Taehyung\u2019s stomach until they reach denim. Everywhere he touches Taehyung, Taehyung\u2019s skin seems to ignite. He burns.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s hands are rough as he pulls the stiff denim and the underlying underwear down, Taehyung moaning in relief when his erection is freed from the rigid fabric. The jeans get caught behind Taehyung\u2019s ankles and Jeongguk yanks them off with one final tug, muttering a few violent expletives under his breath. \u201cStick to your regular clothes next time,\u201d Jeongguk grumbles, forehead creased in annoyance. \u201cThese take fucking forever to get off.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung snickers at Jeongguk\u2019s sexual frustration. \u201cSo impatient.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Taehyung\u2019s chuckles die on his lips when Jeongguk grasp his dick, squeezing it just right and giving it a teasing tug. Taehyung gulps, hips involuntarily bucking up into Jeongguk\u2019s touch, and Jeongguk smirks knowingly. Jeongguk knows all too well that Taehyung is just as desperate as he is.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wishes he had the will power to balk at the blatant smugness, but he\u2019s too hot, too needy for more, so he helps Jeongguk get out of his jeans instead. And then there\u2019s nothing separating them. There\u2019s only naked skin. There\u2019s nothing in the way of their hands and lips as the reacquaint them with all the curves and turns of each other\u2019s body, seeing if anything has changed in the very brief time they were apart. Taehyung finds out Jeongguk feels just as good, tastes just as good, as he did before. Maybe even better. The way Jeongguk dips in the hollow of his throat to torment his soft skin, the way their erections rub together as they move against each other. It seems to get better every time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Taehyung still wants more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGukkie,\u201d Taehyung croaks when Jeongguk rolls their hips together in a particularly effective stroke. \u201cLube.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They disentangle from each other with considerable effort, Jeongguk reaching over to grab the lube from the nightstand drawer. He rolls back with his prize, dropping it on the sheets between them. One hand brushes affectionately across Taehyung\u2019s hipbone, the soft caress making Taehyung shiver.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou want to top?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice embodies a strange combination of lust and sensitivity. This is Jeongguk eager to please, maybe even feeling a bit guilty about how he\u2019d almost ruined their evening by sulking on the couch. This Jeongguk, caring and tender in his own way, makes Taehyung even more keen to crawl under this man\u2019s skin and into his heart and built a permanent home there.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung shakes his head. \u201cNo. You top.\u201d He bites his bottom lip, searching for more words and Jeongguk halts his stroking, picking up on Taehyung\u2019s sudden hesitation and that only makes Taehyung\u2019s chest ache even more. Dark orbs bore into Taehyung\u2019s and Taehyung can\u2019t help but answer the questioning look that lies within the black pools. \u201cThe condoms. Do you-do you want to go without?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There\u2019s an almost imperceptible raise of Jeongguk\u2019s eyebrow piercing but Taehyung catches the faint glimmer. \u201cNo condom?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah.\u201d Taehyung feels a blush creep up his cheeks. But it isn\u2019t shame or embarrassment. It\u2019s a heat that expands under his skin at the thought of what they\u2019re about to do. \u201cI want to feel you. All of you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s answer comes in the form of another bruising kiss. Taehyung will never tire of the way Jeongguk kisses him. Jeongguk\u2019s kisses tell him more about how much he desires Taehyung, how much he cares, than words ever could. There are entire confessions hidden in the way Jeongguk licks into his mouth and moves his tongue against his own.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk moves lover, his lips writing love letters in the slope of Taehyung\u2019s neck, his fingers declaring his eternal affection on the soft skin of Taehyung\u2019s thigh. And Taehyung lets himself sink into the bed, not so much hearing as feeling the words being written into his skin, giving his response in soft groans and gasped breaths.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One slicked finger circles Taehyung\u2019s entrance before slipping inside, Taehyung immediately sinking down on it with crooned pleasure. Taehyung wants to close his eyelids and roll his head back in pleasure but he can\u2019t. Not with Jeongguk\u2019s gaze burning into his own, watching every expression from his spot between Taehyung\u2019s spread legs, every response to his touch that flickers across Taehyung\u2019s face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A second finger joins the first, Taehyung eagerly accepting that one too, Jeongguk\u2019s half-hooded eyes filling with lust-laced wonder. Jeongguk looks as if Taehyung is the most amazing creature he has ever laid eyes upon, has ever touched, and it only makes Taehyung want to please him more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s fingers twist and curl until they find that spot that makes Taehyung fall apart every time he strokes past it, a wrecked sob spilling from Taehyung\u2019s mouth each time he brushes against it. And there are sparks dancing under Taehyung\u2019s skin, travelling from wherever Jeongguk touches him to the heat growing in his lower abdomen.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYou always take it so well, baby,\u201d Jeongguk praises, voice low and full of desire, as he pushes a third finger in. The well-known compliment is like a soothing balm, smothering the sting of being worked open.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung longs for Jeongguk\u2019s hand around his dick again, pushing him over the edge, making him explode, but he resists the temptation to ask for it. He doesn\u2019t want to come like that. He needs Jeongguk inside of him. All of him with no barriers to separate them for the very first time. The mere thought makes shivers run down his spine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cGukkie,\u201d Taehyung groans, deep voice splintered with lust. \u201c<em>Hurry</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk obeys, retracting his fingers, always weak when Taehyung calls him Gukkie. Always weak when Taehyung makes his voice waiver with unbridled neediness. The disappearance of Jeongguk\u2019s digits has Taehyung feeling empty and bereft, the only consolation being the promise of something better.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung props himself up on two elbows, watching Jeongguk lube himself, his face contorted in almost painful pleasure. The sight makes Taehyung\u2019s mouth go dry, a thirst tearing him apart on the inside. He\u2019s burning and only Jeongguk can quench it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cLike this?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s words are gruff and Taehyung wonders if he's still capable of forming coherent sentences. If they both are still capable or if they\u2019re already too far gone in their hazy longing to talk with their mouth instead of their bodies.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung answers as he falls back on the pillows. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Taehyung registers how soft the sex is, how vanilla. But he wants it like this. He wants to see Jeongguk when he takes him inside his body. He wants this new first for them to be slow. Taehyung wants to relish in it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk must feel the same. His hand is undemanding when he grips Taehyung\u2019s hip to hold him steady and the first thrust so agonisingly gentle. Taehyung can feel every inch of Jeongguk push inside him, every little bit of extra stretch sending new flashes of bliss up his spine. And Jeongguk is above him, watching how he tears Taehyung apart in the best way and Taehyung can see the same high reflected in those round black eyes above him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung is sure he\u2019s never seen something as beautiful as the pleasure etched on Jeongguk\u2019s face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk lets his head drop down when he finally bottoms out and curses, hot pants fanning against the crook of Taehyung\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI know,\u201d Taehyung moans in return. And he does know. He\u2019s so fucking close and so is Jeongguk, Taehyung can tell by how Jeongguk\u2019s biceps strain beneath his hands. They\u2019re both trying so hard to keep it together but the feeling of truly melting into one for the first time is like a blissful current trying to pull them under until they drown in it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Yet Jeongguk manages to settle into a slow rhythm, moving so deliberately, trying desperately to prolong the pleasure. Prolong their union. His entire body feels taut against Taehyung with restraint, the effort of holding back painted in every contour of his body.\u00a0It\u2019s torture. The leisurely push and pull into Taehyung\u2019s body, the scorching friction that makes all the nerve endings sings, it\u2019s all torture. The sweetest kind. Taehyung is teetering right at the edge. They both are and he knows that the longer they walk this staggering line, the better the fall.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Every time Jeongguk thrust in, every time Taehyung moves his hips up to meet him, there are new white hot flashes tormenting nerves. Jeongguk feels so good. So close that Taehyung can no longer tell where he ends and Jeongguk begins.\u00a0Taehyung tells him, tells him just how good he feels in broken whispers and breathy grunts, Jeongguk responding by groaning his own sweet nothings into Taehyung\u2019s hair. Their moans and sobs filling the air, mingling with the sound of their bodies coming together, skin against skin.\u00a0Their bodies have become slippery, hands moving smoothly over sweat-slicked planes. Taehyung licks across Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, tasting the salt, before dipping his tongue into the hollow of his collarbone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Maybe he\u2019d done it on purpose. Maybe he\u2019d wanted Jeongguk\u2019s resolve to break. And it does break. Taehyung can feel the exact moment Jeongguk\u2019s carefully crafted dam of will power caves and he\u2019s overrun by a hungry fiery need that he can\u2019t hold back any longer.\u00a0Jeongguk speeds up, his lunges punishing and desperate like he wants to completely disappear into Taehyung\u2019s body and never leave. Taehyung eagerly takes every single one, nails digging into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder, leaving crescent-shaped marks in their wake. And Jeongguk is kissing him like he\u2019s loving him, peppering Taehyung with feeling as their mouths crash together. And it all melts, the touching, the kissing, the emotions, until they\u2019re a tightly wound ball of heat that\u2019s burning Taehyung up from the inside.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But it\u2019s a pace Jeongguk can\u2019t keep up with and ultimately his rhythm falters followed by his release. The feeling of Jeongguk swelling inside him and the additional stretch is the final flame that makes the coil of heat in Taehyung\u2019s abdomen explode and consume him in a blaze of ecstasy. He comes untouched, painting both their stomach white while Jeongguk does the same deep within Taehyung.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk\u2019s body is heavy when he slumps down on top of Taehyung but Taehyung loves the weight. He loves how it ground and anchors him to the bed until he\u2019s able of finding his way back to his own body. Until the flames of pleasure retreat and there\u2019s nothing but the warm glow of contentment left behind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t know how long it takes for their breathing to return to normal but it\u2019s long enough for Jeongguk to grow soft and slip from his body, making them both shiver with the aftermath of their desire. Jeongguk rolls off Taehyung and for a moment Taehyung is scared Jeongguk might leave to get a towel but he doesn\u2019t. He pulls Taehyung flush against him instead.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung starts drawing lazy patterns across Jeongguk\u2019s body with one hand, tracing all the tattoos that are no longer a mystery to him. Jeongguk does the same, hand dipping over Taehyung\u2019s waist and continuing downwards, until a finger finds Taehyung\u2019s entrance and the evidence of what they just did.\u00a0In an uncharacteristic moment of bashfulness, Taehyung feels a redness colour the tip of his ears. He opens his mouth to make a silly remark to try and hide his sudden embarrassment but Jeongguk beats him to it, all cheeky grin and bunny teeth, \u201cMy dick has ruined you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung punches his fist against Jeongguk\u2019s arm but it lacks force with how mushy his muscles still feel after his orgasm. \u201cDon\u2019t steal my lines.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cMaybe you should get new lines,\u201d Jeongguk teases with twinkling eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung looks at the young man beside him. Not the tough guy people think he is but not the fragile boy from his weakest moments either. Just Jeongguk. His Jeongguk. The Jeongguk only he gets to see.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI love you,\u201d Taehyung whispers. They\u2019d never said it like that before; soft-spoken instead of teasing, words pregnant with meaning, faces so close that their noses are almost touching. Now it\u2019s Jeongguk\u2019s turn to blush and Taehyung feels a thick, warm blanket of satisfaction settle over him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u201cI love you too,\u201d Jeongguk whispers back, almost stammering over the words. Taehyung glows, a radiance uncurling in his chest and spreading all the way down to the tip of his toes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After that, Jeongguk is all loving touches and affectionate caresses in the shower, laughing for a good five minutes at Taehyung\u2019s raccoon eyes from the runny eyeliner. He even lets Taehyung use one of his stupidly expensive shampoos and body washes, only grumbling a little in protest when Taehyung ends up using an excessive amount in his enthousiasm. It takes a single kiss for Taehyung to be forgiven.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their finger tops are wrinkly by the time they make it back to the bed. Clean and barefaced, Taehyung settles on his side of the bed after they decorated it with a fresh pair of sheets, some rings and his spare phone adapter a permanent fixture on the nightstand beside it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Jeongguk lies down on the mattress behind him with his chest against Taehyung\u2019s back. A hand starts carding its familiar path through Taehyung\u2019s hair, drawing sleep even closer, always successful at pulling Taehyung down into a slumber. Jeongguk will probably sniffle during the night but it doesn\u2019t matter because Taehyung no longer has trouble sleeping through the sounds. Taehyung will probably end up flailing his limbs in his sleep but Jeongguk will just constrain him by wrapping him in a tight hug like he does most nights Taehyung comes over. They\u2019ve adjusted to each other\u2019s quirks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung doesn\u2019t worry as he falls asleep. He might not know where he\u2019ll do his graduate studies, if they\u2019ll offer him a position at the school they\u2019re at now, or if he\u2019ll continue his studies somewhere else. The future might be uncertain but he\u2019s no longer willing to settle on something less than what he has with Jeongguk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taehyung wants to burn. He wants to see the world in vibrant colours. Sometimes that means trouble. Sometimes it makes Taehyung trouble and occasionally, Jeongguk is trouble too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But mostly, Taehyung knows he\u2019ll never be cold with Jeongguk holding him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>"
