  "notes": "<p>So Lissadiane challenged me to write some of her favorite tropes: hurt/comfort, werewolf Stiles/bitten by someone other than Derek/against his will (\u201cbelongs\u201d to other alpha trope), protective alpha Derek, angst, and super-secret pining.</p>\n<p>Besides having full shift wolves (why bother being a werewolf if you can\u2019t become a WOLF, right?), this goes WILDY AU after, uh, the season where Stiles, Scott and Allison sacrifice themselves to find their parents. Three? Maybe? And it doesn\u2019t even follow that all that much, because I feel like that's the season where Boyd &amp; Erica died? See, I've blocked it out. Basically nobody died and nobody moved away and there was no Nogitsune or anything after.</p>\n<p>Guys, <i>guys</i>, please don\u2019t come back at me and say: this would never happen. Because I know. I know this is, like, the ultimate guilty pleasure fic both for me and Lissadiane\u2014<i>Stiles cries a lot</i>. There is pain and yearning and self-defeatism and -disgust. There are Boyd-hugs and puppy piles. </p>\n<p>This is so far out of my comfort zone that I had to take three boats and a plane to get there, so please: appreciate the hardship I went through for my one and only writing buddy.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>sometimes I write stuff on <a href=\"https://pantstomatch.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a></p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles, already panic-stricken and strung out, feels like a lead ball has settled in the pit of his stomach, spreading toxic dread slowly through his bloodstream to mix with the fear that\u2019d been pumping through him for days. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says, strangled.</p>\n<p>Derek makes an impatient noise, a huff of breath, like Stiles is some kind of annoyance he doesn\u2019t feel like dealing with. \u201cYou can\u2019t think\u2026I don\u2019t know <em>what</em> you\u2019re thinking, Stiles,\u201d he bites out, \u201cbut you can\u2019t come back here. Not <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. His lips feel numb, and there\u2019s a roaring in his ears, like every person within a three block radius is screaming at him. He\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s actually managing words. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 not do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s heavy breathing on Derek\u2019s end, the faint rumble of a growl, and Stiles almost feels like he can hear the pounding of Derek\u2019s heart through the crummy cell reception. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what else to say, but he doggedly hangs on, listening.</p>\n<p>Derek finally says, voice ragged, \u201cIf you wanted this\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says faintly, horrified. Horrified by <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>The ragged breathing gives way to a harsh laugh. \u201cRight, yeah,\u201d he says, and Stiles feels lost.</p>\n<p>He feels the physical embodiment of <em>devastated</em>, his already too strung-out mind struggling to wall up all the hurt, the rejection\u2014he takes a deep shuddering breath and looks down at the shredded skin on his arms, at the sluggish way they\u2019re weakly healing.</p>\n<p>There is nothing, <em>nothing</em> he wants more than to have Derek sweep in and make everything all better. He should have known, though, that something like that would never happen to him. He hangs up without saying goodbye.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles let himself have ten days to freak out about it before he\u2019d called Derek. Freak out about the club that Adam had dragged him to, the fucking dubious consent issue, when he\u2019d trusted Adam\u2014his roommate of two fucking years, before he moved out of the dorms\u2014to watch out for him, to stay a true blue DD to Stiles\u2019s turn to get trashed. To freak out about the whole surprise dance-floor scent marking thing, and the way tipsy Stiles might be able to handle himself, but drunk Stiles doesn\u2019t have enough hands or bats to fend off a territorial alpha.</p>\n<p>Freaking out easily gave way to terror, to three days locked in his bathroom, copious amounts of accidentally on purpose bloodletting, tasting the metallic tang of tap water, the scent of mildew and mold so deep in his nose it felt like a gag at the back of his throat. He\u2019d crawled out just long enough to panic-dial Derek, only to hear condemnation.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no excuse. Stiles let his guard down, and now apparently Derek isn\u2019t going to ever forgive him for it.</p>\n<p>He shows up at Cal\u2019s apartment the day after Derek tells him to stay away, an invisible, painful hook in his chest tugging him in the correct direction.</p>\n<p>Cal and his obnoxiously bright orange polo shirt lean against the doorjamb and smirk at him. \u201cI\u2019m impressed you resisted my call this long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs, shoulders tight. He doesn\u2019t bother to say that he hasn\u2019t been able to feel anything over his own fear and dread, the way he couldn\u2019t control his shift, locked up like a rabid dog tearing at its own flesh. He doesn\u2019t bother to point out that maybe Cal should have come to <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>Behind Cal are two ladies he doesn\u2019t recognize, and another asshole that Stiles vaguely remembers from the club\u2014tall, lean like a scarecrow, bizarre punk hair that makes his nose look like a beak. All three flash gold eyes at Stiles and Stiles feels a burn in his own as they automatically flash back.</p>\n<p>One of the girls hisses, like a startled cat, but the scarecrow just gives him a lazy salute of welcome.</p>\n<p>The other girl cocks her head at him, sharp and assessing, and says, \u201cBlue eyes here might be a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cal claps a large, warm hand around Stiles\u2019s nape, fingers pressing firmly in on either side of his throat, and says, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>It makes Stiles\u2019s skin crawl, makes him want to hunch into himself, nausea pooling spit in his mouth, and he hates the way he leans into the touch.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles, who has lasted nearly three years of college without a single panic attack, finds himself asphyxiating on his anxiety daily, eating his fears with heaping helpings of coffee in between, and is probably the only werewolf in history who\u2019s actually managed to give himself a stomach ulcer.</p>\n<p>That part is merely conjecture, but he figures there has to be something to all this blood he\u2019s been throwing up.</p>\n<p>Lainey, Trix and scarecrow Jim are not the only wolves in Cal\u2019s pack.</p>\n<p>There are various other douchebags in different sizes and shapes, enough to make Stiles wonder why Cal even bothered with him\u2014it\u2019s not like he needed the numbers.</p>\n<p>Scarecrow Jim is perpetually high on wolfbane-laced pot, and he tells Stiles, \u201cYou smell nice,\u201d and Cal likes to exercise his alpha bad-touch after a long day by face-planting into the crook of Stiles\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t like having an alpha he can\u2019t trust. He doesn\u2019t like feeling this on edge and helpless. This was only one of the myriad reasons he never wanted to be a were in the first place. He saw what kind of sway Peter had tried to exert over Scott, a far stronger werewolf than Stiles will ever be. He remembers Isaac, and the way he used to cower away from Derek when he got mad.</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to tell Cal\u2019s entire pack to fuck off, but he\u2019s literally got no other options right now. He takes the cuffs to the back of the head, far harder than any playful one his dad had ever given him, and <em>worries</em>.</p>\n<p>His first full moon looms closer. Cal seems sadistically pleased by watching Stiles fall apart. It\u2019s like he\u2019s hoping for this\u2014for Stiles to go crazed. He offers nothing in the way of reassurances or medieval torture chains. He scruffs a hand through Stiles\u2019s hair, calls him Scamp, and tells him to lock his bedroom door.</p>\n<p>Stiles stops sleeping completely three days till.</p>\n<p>He skypes Scott, finally, something he\u2019s been putting off for weeks, and gets a grimace and a, \u201cYou look like shit,\u201d for his troubles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Stiles says, forcing a grin. \u201cReally feeling the love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott says, \u201cSorry,\u201d and, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and, \u201cDerek\u2019s on a power trip, but fuck him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is only faintly horrified by the curse, and mostly charmed by the clenched, belligerent jaw. He says, \u201cAw, Scotty, are you worried about me?\u201d with a lightness he doesn\u2019t feel.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Stiles,\u201d Scott glances cagily over his shoulder, \u201cDerek\u2019s being really weird about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen is Derek <em>not</em> weird about things?\u201d Stiles says. He curls up a little smaller in his seat and hopes Scott can\u2019t hear his heart going crazy. \u201cWhat, did he tell you not to talk to me anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks satisfyingly scandalized. \u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d he says vehemently, but then he adds, sheepish, \u201cHe just said I can\u2019t tell you pack stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 can\u2019t,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, you know,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cnothing we can\u2019t handle. You shouldn\u2019t worry! I think you need to sleep more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Sleep will help, sure. Nothing like closing your eyes and falling into constant nightmares to help alleviate the physically painful reality of the day. This conversation was a terrible idea. Stiles feels sort of detached now, though, and the constant stabbing pain in his abdomen has been numbed by tragic unhappiness, so, like, yay for that. \u201cRight, well, I should go. I have to be at Cal\u2019s in a half hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the name, Scott\u2019s mouth twists. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and says, \u201cYeah, buddy, neither do I.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Two days until the full moon, and Stiles feels like something\u2019s eating his skin from the inside. Like all his seams will burst open, spilling a monster out all over the floor. He thinks about Jackson and how he turned wrong, turned out worse, and wonders if he\u2019s going to even see a wolf on the other side of this.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s much more likely that Stiles will be an abomination, and the thought of that makes him want to shred the flesh off his bones and find out <em>now</em>, so it won\u2019t be a surprise.</p>\n<p>His blue eyes, he gets. There\u2019s a darkness on his soul, a foul blot of unnatural death, sacrificed to save his dad. He lets Cal and Trix and Lainey think the blue is for a much more sinister reason. It\u2019s double-edged. They leave him alone\u2014Cal, with a thread of anticipation, Lainey, with curiosity, and Trix with wary fear\u2014and then they <em>leave him alone</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a pack animal with a pack that isn\u2019t a pack. He\u2019s paranoid and lonely by turns. He knows, he <em>knows</em>, deep down, that Cal is delighted by this. He thinks: god, what if Cal turned him just for the perverse pleasure of <em>putting him down</em>.\u00a0 It\u2019s crazy in a way that isn\u2019t crazy. As the moon starts to exert its pull over Stiles, he can even see how clearly it\u2019ll happen.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s loss of control. Maybe he kills someone, maybe it\u2019s just <em>almost</em>, but a feral can\u2019t survive\u2014can\u2019t be expected to survive. Stiles could be torn apart, and nobody could say he didn\u2019t deserve it.</p>\n<p>Time ticks slow, and Stiles watches the shadows stretch across his floor from midnight to morning, taking jerky, harsh breaths and digging his claws into his palms. Blood drips on the floor, pooling on the hardwood, and the dawning sun makes it gleam.</p>\n<p>One more night to go.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>His phone buzzes on his way out of his last class. It\u2019s startling. It hasn\u2019t rung in weeks\u2014Stiles calls his dad like clockwork, with forceful cheer so he doesn\u2019t worry, and no one in Cal\u2019s pack ever bothered to ask for his number.</p>\n<p>He stares at Derek\u2019s contact for too long and blinks, like coming out of a fog, when the phone stops vibrating.</p>\n<p>Immediately, it starts again, this time with Scott\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>He answers it with a low, \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>A lull, and then Derek\u2019s voice says, \u201cStiles,\u201d and Stiles\u2019s heart tries to climb up his throat and out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>All his words are swollen and stuck; it\u2019s an effort just to breathe.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you,\u201d formal and polite and gruff, like Stiles is a stranger.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s breathing sounds ragged to his own ears, and he slumps down onto a bench outside the library, curling his head in between his knees.</p>\n<p>Derek is saying even more words, something about the preserve and death and Lydia, and Stiles thinks <em>yes, this, they need me</em>, and forces himself to focus on the halting way Derek says, \u201cSo can you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows hard and says, \u201cCan I what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs noisily. He says, \u201cDid you hear anything I said?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Stiles says. He slowly unfurls, straightens, ignores the curious looks of other students passing by. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll send me Lydia\u2019s notes,\u201d Derek says flatly.</p>\n<p>Lydia\u2019s notes. The parts of the bestiary, he guesses, they\u2019d been working on last month. Before this shit storm happened. They\u2019d been delving into the fae end of the supernatural pool, exchanging long-distance research notes while she was on the east coast.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, slowly, \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>After another long silence, Derek says, \u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d and Stiles almost laughs. Almost gives in to hysterics, because Alpha Derek Hale, who didn\u2019t even have to pause and think about it before rejecting him, wants to know if he\u2019s <em>okay</em>. Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Stiles is pretty sure his, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be, dude?\u201d comes out high and strung-out, panicky, but Derek only sucks in a harsh breath and hangs up on him.</p>\n<p>Of fucking course.</p>\n<p>Stiles digs the corner of his phone into his cheekbone and tries not to cry.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In the end, his first full moon experience is kind of anticlimactic if he discounts the way his bedroom looks like the scene of a murder. A murder where someone got torn apart by a hacksaw. He\u2019s probably never getting his security deposit back.</p>\n<p>Honestly, he makes it through the night mostly intact by the skin of his teeth, with an anchor of pure stubbornness. A great big fuck you to Cal and to Derek Fucking Hale and to Lainey, who won\u2019t stay in any room alone with him.</p>\n<p>Cal seems openly disappointed, and doesn\u2019t really take Stiles\u2019s word for it until he scours the news for any reports of maulings. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what\u2019s going on here, but Stiles doesn\u2019t know how to make it stop either.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s weak-limbed and hollow-eyed, hungry, even though he knows he\u2019ll throw up anything he tries to choke down.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s okay</em>, Stiles wants to tell him. He\u2019s pretty sure stubbornness makes a lousy anchor\u2014he doesn't think it\u2019ll last.</p>\n<p>Cal shrugs off his disappointment for another few weeks of lounging all over Stiles, though, whenever he tells him to come over.</p>\n<p>Little things like this confuse him, make him feel like he\u2019s slowly eroding away, and he still wakes up in the middle of the night with screaming pain in his insides, puking up black bile all over his comforter, and the thing is: Stiles still doesn\u2019t know. He can think \u2018wolf,\u2019 but he only really knows <em>predator</em>. He could be an alligator for all the damage he\u2019s done. His beta shift\u2019s an eye flash, and even lizards have claws. He\u2019s too weak with anxiety to even drop a fang. Who the fuck knows what actually showed up on the full moon to rip his mattress apart? He wasn\u2019t exactly lucid enough to look in a mirror.</p>\n<p>He thinks about texting Lydia, asking what she thinks, but in the end he doesn\u2019t do anything at all. She\u2019s been sending him increasingly passive-aggressive emails, and he\u2019s been ignoring her texts. He doesn\u2019t know what to say to her.</p>\n<p>The second month starts out rough, but not rough<em>er</em>. There\u2019s nothing that he hasn\u2019t already faced\u2014he feels vaguely ashamed, being shuffled to the edge of Cal\u2019s pack with a kind of numb acceptance that he never would have stood for with Derek. It\u2019s shock, he thinks. One month, two months\u2026 eventually he\u2019ll snap out of it. One morning he\u2019ll wake up with his old energy, exercise his sarcasm again, like relearning how to swing a bat.</p>\n<p>A week in, and Scarecrow Jim pokes him in the belly, says, \u201cWake up, man. It hurts to look at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim has blown pupils and the angular cheeks of a starving dog. He leans in close to Stiles and says, \u201cYour wolf is going to eat you alive.\u201d It feels, for a long, slow, moment, like he\u2019s looking <em>into</em> Stiles. Can see under his skin to whatever monster is lurking behind his heart. Jim widens his eyes and says, \u201cAccept or it\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cal slaps the back of Jim\u2019s head. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, ass-munch.\u201d But then he turns a scary, anticipatory grin on Stiles and says, \u201cAccept. Or <em>I\u2019ll</em> kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles says, stuffing his hands in his pockets.</p>\n<p>Cal flicks out his claws, razor sharp, and lets red bleeds into his irises. He\u2019s a bull of a wolf, stocky and broad, thick neck and thin-lipped, toothy grin. \u201cOh, I think I\u2019m much scarier than whatever internal battle you\u2019re fighting, dude. I don\u2019t care if you shift into a kitten.\u201d He cocks his head, assessing.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks: <em>does he know about the Beacon Hills kanima?</em></p>\n<p>Cal blinks and says, \u201cLet\u2019s see how full moon number two goes, shall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Trix says, \u201cMeow,\u201d with a mocking cat-scratch.</p>\n<p>Stiles just hunches his shoulders and says, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Full moon number two falls directly before winter break. Stiles ends up mostly blissfully unconscious for it, thanks to snagging a baggie of Scarecrow Jim\u2019s special weed, but he wakes up in a pool of blood. Assuming it\u2019s his own, all his wounds seemed to have already healed. His throat feels like he\u2019s been screaming all night, and there\u2019s a note pinned on his door when he drags himself out for class\u2014a noise complaint, a reminder of his pet-free housing agreement, and two red x\u2019s, like he\u2019s a contestant on Family Feud. He gets the implication. Crumpling it up in his fist, he jams it into his pocket and tries to figure out if getting evicted out would be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>Derek words\u2014<em>you can\u2019t come back</em>\u2014play over and over in his head as he slowly makes his way to class. Derek doesn\u2019t <em>own</em> Beacon Hills. Stiles is going home for break, he\u2019s getting the fuck out of here, at least for a couple weeks, and Derek can go fuck himself if he has a problem with it.</p>\n<p>Scott says, \u201cHell yeah,\u201d later on skype, but the smile on his mouth doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just,\u201d Scott shakes his head, \u201cPack stuff. Derek being a dick. We miss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s hands feel cold then blazing hot, like frostbite. \u201cReally?\u201d He flexes his fingers over his knees and leans forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, man,\u201d Scott says, stoic and sincere.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods slowly, fighting off the urge to demand exactly who is <em>we</em>. \u201cIf Derek\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot Derek,\u201d Scott says quickly, and Stiles\u2019s heart plummets into his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cMy flight comes in at two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott sighs and says, \u201cGood,\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Restless nights are par for the course, but the thought of going home make the morning seem brighter. He ignores the bruises under his eyes\u2014tries to avoid his reflection altogether\u2014and shoves all of his clothes into a bag, dirty and clean, when he rolls out of bed at dawn. Coffee is a hot burn of acid to his insides, but he downs three cups anyway. After a handful of dry Captain Crunch, he stuffs his toothbrush and toothpaste into a sandwich bag and debates going to the airport now, just to wait in the lounge for five hours. He\u2019s even thinking about filling a baggie of cereal to take with him when the door handle of his front door rattles\u2014he listens, half-paralyzed, to the slick snick sound of a key entering a lock.</p>\n<p>And then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, blue eyes,\u201d Cal says, sweeping into Stiles\u2019s apartment, door banging off the wall before he slams it shut behind him. He slaps his hands together and stares at Stiles, poised in the archway between his tiny kitchen and barebones living room.</p>\n<p>Stiles clenches his jaw, but doesn\u2019t move. <em>Fuck</em>. He\u2019d almost made it out of there without Cal knowing\u2014he\u2019d have paid for it later, maybe, but in the mean time he\u2019d have been <em>home</em>.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Cal\u2019s thin lips spread into a closed-mouth smile. He takes in Stiles\u2019s bags on the sagging, worn couch without a single change in expression and says, \u201cTime to earn your keep.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Earning his keep</em> turns out to be, uh, torture. Murder? He\u2019s not sure, but it looks bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Stiles backpedals into the doorway of Cal\u2019s apartment, but he\u2019s stopped from fleeing completely by Trix gripping his arm. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cal shows his first sign of irritation and impatience, squaring his shoulders, a furrow appearing between his eyebrows. \u201cListen, Stilinksi, you\u2019ve been seriously lacking in the entertainment division\u2014\u201d which Stiles takes to mean he hasn\u2019t been providing them with enough out-of-control feral wolf rampage throw-downs, \u201c\u2014the least you can do is take care of this guy for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2018This guy\u2019 looks like he\u2019s about to piss himself, kneeling between two of Cal\u2019s faceless betas.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says again. Trix twists his arm a little, digging her fingernails in hard enough to pierce through his shirt.</p>\n<p>Cal practically pouts. \u201cHe\u2019s been sniffing around Lainey. I don\u2019t like his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not your werewolf minion,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to <em>kill</em> someone for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKill, maim,\u201d Cal waffles his hand, like either of those things is okay. \u201cAlthough we do have to maintain some secrecy here, and this little fella definitely saw your eyes flash. Really, it\u2019s the only responsible solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou\u2019re certifiable, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>The jitter of irritation in Cal\u2019s body gives way to a furious calm, and the hair on the back of Stiles\u2019s neck stands straight up. He swallows down a reflexive whimper when Cal lifts a single, damning eyebrow at him. Stiles used to think that was sexy, when Derek did it. God.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cal says, \u201cnow you\u2019re good for <em>nothing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trix snaps his arm before Stiles can even blink, a pained howl tears from his throat, and the last thing Stiles registers coherently is Scarecrow Jim\u2019s somewhat apologetic face before he slams his fist into the side of Stiles\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles walks like an old man: cautious, with bones that hurt, a limp in his step that\u2019s hard to completely hide. Scott takes one look at him, standing on the sidewalk outside baggage claim, and freezes. Stiles can see the careful smile on his face for what it is: a sorry attempt to cover worry, shock, confusion, and helplessness.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels only a little gratified. <em>See, Scott</em>, he thinks. <em>See what happens when you don\u2019t take care of your toys?</em></p>\n<p>He shakes it off easily, though, because he\u2019s not Scott\u2019s and this wasn\u2019t his fault, anyway. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault but his own.</p>\n<p>He tries to say the words <em>don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going back</em>, but he doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019re true.</p>\n<p>Scott hugs him, careful and soft.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, I\u2019m not broken,\u201d and tugs Scott closer, arms tight around his back. He\u2019s not sure if those words are true either, but Scott doesn\u2019t call him out on a lie.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott pulls back to raise an eyebrow, wonky smile not quite <em>there</em>. \u201cReally?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles pats his shoulder and says, \u201cI just need a nap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s got his mom\u2019s sensible Honda and drives like he thinks Stiles is going to fall apart on a sharp turn, but Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything. He doesn\u2019t say anything when Scott goes through the Sonic drive through to get milkshakes and fries, and he doesn\u2019t say anything when Scott takes five minutes to parallel park in front of his house, and Stiles has been so used to not saying anything for <em>months</em> that he doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s his fatal mistake.</p>\n<p>Scott turns off the car and says, quiet and serious, \u201cI\u2019m not going to bug you about this. But I\u2019m going to tell Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d Stiles says, horrified. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to tell your dad,\u201d Scott says over him, voice flatly calm. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all going to sit down and talk about what the fuck has been happening to you since September.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s mouth, which had been hanging open, snaps shut with a mutinous scowl. \u201cNo,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Scott stares at him sadly, but doesn\u2019t argue.</p>\n<p>Stiles hunches his shoulders and tries not to think about the fact that Scott will probably tell Derek and his dad anyway. Finally, he sighs and says, \u201cJust, uh. Give me a couple days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you can work yourself up into a panic?\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t think I could feel any worse than I do now, okay? A few days.\u201d He holds out his hands. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll tell my dad myself.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mention Derek. He doesn\u2019t want to actually see Derek. He knows it\u2019ll be kind of impossible with his month-long break, but he\u2019s going to give it a try.</p>\n<p>Stiles lets himself into the house under the watchful eye of Scott, who doesn\u2019t drive off until Stiles flashes the porch light at him. Stiles\u2019s dad isn\u2019t off-shift yet, so the house is eerily empty. It\u2019s also devoid of anything remotely food-like\u2014what has his dad been surviving on?\u2014so he makes a command decision, grabs the keys to his baby\u2014he\u2019d <em>missed</em> him\u2014and heads to the grocery store.</p>\n<p>Of course, command decisions aren\u2019t always the <em>best</em> ones. He finds himself leaning heavily onto the cart as he trolls the aisles, but he\u2019s focused enough to pick up meat, various veggies, Lucky Charms, Pop Tarts and a pineapple.</p>\n<p>Not the greatest selection, but it\u2019s better than the pizza his dad is probably expecting to order. He feels beat up, literally, and tired beyond all possible belief, and it\u2019ll be a miracle if he actually manages to cook something for dinner before passing out.</p>\n<p>Check-out is a blur, and he\u2019s almost to the car when he hears a laugh. An Erica laugh, distinctive and vicious, and he very carefully slows his cart, automatically drawing himself into a tighter, less noticeable form.</p>\n<p>Stiles sees Derek before Derek sees him, which would be fortunate if all of Stiles\u2019s limbs didn\u2019t immediately freeze in place. Derek is grinning at Erica, head ducked, sporting a soft-looking beard and an equally soft-looking Henley. Jesus. He\u2019d forgotten how to handle the full force of Derek-in-person, and how once upon a time Stiles thought he could be in love with him. Like, <em>for real</em>. How stupid could he be, right?</p>\n<p>And Stiles himself might be less noticeable, but good old Roscoe is locally famous, and it seems like Derek and Erica and Boyd have been waiting for him. Crap.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still standing there in the middle of the parking lot when Derek glances up and over at him.</p>\n<p>Derek frowns, a line forming in between his handsome brows, and Stiles somehow coaxes his feet into moving. Thank god for the cart and the way it\u2019s basically stopping him from falling over.</p>\n<p>Out of the corner of his eye, Stiles watches Derek jerk his head at Erica and Boyd before walking purposely toward Stiles\u2019s jeep. He really hopes this isn\u2019t some kind of keep out of my territory shit, like Stiles was supposed to remember his pack manners and announce his presence to the alpha in his own damn town.</p>\n<p>Derek meets him at the back of his jeep and says, \u201cYou look sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, sorry we all can\u2019t be constant dazzling displays of manly hotness,\u201d Stiles says, half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s brow wrinkles even more. \u201cWhat does that have to do with being sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, I have no idea.\u201d Right now he wants to go home and lock himself in his childhood bedroom and sleep for at least a week. Maybe two. He\u2019s not even hungry anymore.</p>\n<p>But then his body, which has held on so desperately over the past few months, finally decides to fully betray him. He grimaces at the intense stabbing pain in his gut, hitches a breath through raw airways. \u201cShit,\u201d he says, hoarse, and then he throws up blood all over Derek\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At some point, embarrassingly enough, Stiles must pass out. He wakes up in his own bed, with Scott sitting up next to him, Stiles\u2019s shoulder pressed into his hip.</p>\n<p>Stiles groans and his entire body throbs, like one huge stubbed toe, but he feels surprisingly better than he did before.</p>\n<p>First things first, Stiles thinks. \u201cHow did I get back here?\u201d The last thing he remembers is the glaring fluorescent light of the grocery store and Derek\u2019s horrified expression.</p>\n<p>Scott says, \u201cDerek carried you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Awesome. And humiliating. He covers his face with his hands and groans. Of course that happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott says, placing a hand on his arm, \u201cyou don\u2019t... smell right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, voice muffled. He\u2019s not surprised. He doesn\u2019t <em>feel</em> right, either. He takes a deep, watery breath, drops his arms to his sides and says, \u201cYou can come out now, creeper wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek slinks into the room from the hallway. His eyes flash red and Stiles grits his teeth and absolutely <em>does not</em> bare his neck. Goddamnit.</p>\n<p>Scotty scowls at Derek and then gives Stiles a strained grin. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cI need you to tell us exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek growls. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s eyes narrow. His, \u201cStiles,\u201d is full of disappointment.</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs against his pillow. \u201cApparently I\u2019m just a super crappy werewolf. Who knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Scott says with no hesitation.</p>\n<p>Derek looks furious.</p>\n<p>Stiles fights off the urge to shrink back and says, \u201cWhat?\u201d defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek says. He clenches his jaw so hard Stiles thinks his teeth might crack, and then he silently stalks from the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles says to no one, defeated. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott says, \u201cStiles, tell me,\u201d and Stiles says, weakly, \u201cYou know he\u2019s probably still listening in, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott just stares at him with his best puppy-dog eyes, because he knows Stiles is defenseless against them.</p>\n<p>He deflates into the mattress and says, \u201cOkay, so, I think I might be dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott doesn\u2019t believe him. It\u2019s there in the careful nod of his head, the loosening of his grip in Stiles\u2019s covers. He says, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep breath and, to his utter horror, starts <em>crying</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good long ugly cry in between spilling out bits and pieces of Stiles\u2019s entire craptastic semester at school, of Cal and his pack, of puking up black goo and blood and bile, of barely passing his classes\u2014he tells Scott that he\u2019s thinking about dropping out, but he\u2019s got nowhere else to go.</p>\n<p>Scott wraps his arms around him and presses his cheek into the top of his head and murmurs, \u201cI don\u2019t get why you even wanted this in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snuffles and half-chokes on snot and tears and says, \u201cWhat? Want <em>what</em>? To be bit by some random douchebag in a bar? To be kicked out of Derek\u2019s pack? Yeah, who wouldn\u2019t want <em>that</em>, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s arms tighten, mashing Stiles\u2019s face into his chest. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says, voice hard. \u201cDo you\u2014do you mean you didn\u2019t ask for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Something crashes downstairs, like glass shattering, and Stiles tilts his head so his forehead is digging into the meat of Scott\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy would I fucking ask for this? <em>Ever</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d Scott relaxes his hold. \u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d found some, uh, people you liked better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. He says, \u201cI love you, Scotty, but sometimes you can be really dumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s his old bed, the comforting scent of his dad and Scott, or just being a couple hundred miles away from Cal, but Stiles sleeps like a rock. When he finally drags himself conscious again, he feels marginally better\u2014less strung out and weak-limbed, and he can tell that most of his bruising is more than halfway healed. Finally. He\u2019s hungry, but his stomach still feels raw, and he has to scrub dried blood out from around his nostrils when he showers.</p>\n<p>Somehow, he\u2019s unsurprised to find Derek sitting on the edge of his bed when he gets back to his room.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s implacable gaze dips to Stiles\u2019s bare chest and then up again. He says, \u201cWe could do this one of two ways. I can give you the bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hitches the towel around his waist, grits his teeth against the immediate <em>yes, fuck, please</em> that wants to spill out of his mouth\u2014locks his knees against just dropping to the floor right in front of him.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes narrow, like he\u2019s able to read exactly what Stiles is thinking all over his face. Hell, he probably can.</p>\n<p>Stiles straightens his back and ignores all his screaming muscles.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d Derek continues, red bleeding into his irises, a tiny, vicious tick to his jaw, \u201cI can go rip out your alpha\u2019s heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what it is about that that has him blinking back tears, but one second he\u2019s standing by his bedroom door and the next he\u2019s climbing onto Derek\u2019s lap, wrapping arms around his back and hitching uneven breaths into his neck.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cHe\u2019s not my alpha,\u201d and for the first time it sounds true.</p>\n<p>Derek slides careful hands up his sides, curls one over his nape to tuck him closer and says, hoarse, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Clad in soft sweats and a worn t-shirt, Stiles cups his hands around a hot mug of coffee that he has no intention of actually drinking. He says, \u201cLet me get this straight. You thought I wanted to be a werewolf, but not <em>your</em> werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>From behind him, Derek drops a weighty, comforting hand on the join of Stiles\u2019s neck, but his voice is still gruff when he says, \u201cYou thought I\u2019d kick you out just for being one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles tries and fails to flail out of Derek\u2019s grip, tipping his head back to glare up at him. \u201cI was the one bleeding all over my bathroom floor and freaking out, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek growls and Stiles can\u2019t help his involuntary flinch. Derek is halfway across the room from him in an instant, flashing him wounded, worried eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles says, slumping down in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t be arguing about this. <em>I\u2019m</em> sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to say <em>don\u2019t worry</em>, and <em>it\u2019s not your fault</em>, but he just snaps it shut again, teeth clicking. He stares down at his coffee and thinks about how he\u2019s never completely felt his wolf, not really. How he doesn\u2019t remember full moons, and feels like his insides are eating their way out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he says, embarrassingly small and scared, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek says. He holds his hands up and out, approaching him again slowly, like Stiles could ever be legitimately afraid of him. \u201cI already told you. We get rid of your old alpha, and you become mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles ignores the thrill those words send down his spine and says, \u201cWill that <em>fix</em> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking\u2014\u201d Stiles throws his hands up. \u201cStop bullshitting me, Derek. There\u2019s something wrong. Am I\u2026\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cAm I gonna be like Jackson?\u201d</p>\n<p>He <em>tries</em>. He does. He closes his eyes and pictures his possible wolf\u2014lanky, like him, with big paws and big teeth. Reddish or brown fur, probably. It all feels so separate and foreign, though, and he\u2019s getting a headache.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour body isn\u2019t rejecting the bite, Stiles,\u201d Derek says, and when Stiles opens his eyes again he\u2019s hunched down in front of him, one hand on the table, the other hovering over the curve of Stiles\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, a harsh, wounded sound. \u201cHave you seen me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says, looking at Stiles like\u2026 like Stiles <em>isn\u2019t</em> falling apart. \u201cYou\u2019re just rejecting your alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>The constant ache in his abdomen balloons sharply, and then fizzles out like a sparkler. \u201cI guess I have good instincts,\u201d Stiles says, nearly breathless with the immediate lack of pain. It\u2019s a miracle, he thinks, and then he registers the warmth of Derek\u2019s palm on his face and the black lines winding up his arm. Oh.</p>\n<p>Derek says, so soft it\u2019s almost a whisper, \u201cDo you want me to bite you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a loaded question,\u201d Stiles says, and delights at the smile that blooms across Derek\u2019s face in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make this right,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Stiles hooks a hand around Derek\u2019s wrist and says, \u201cYes, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Scott insists on taking Stiles to see Deaton.</p>\n<p>Stiles agrees, giving Derek a tired smile. \u201cNo offense, big guy,\u201d Stiles says, patting his arm, \u201cbut I\u2019d rather hear that I\u2019m not on the verge of death from a medical professional.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vet,\u201d Derek says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>werewolf</em> vet,\u201d Stiles says, and watches Derek\u2019s mouth tighten when Stiles adds, \u201cWhich I am now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d again, expression pinched, and Stiles says, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deaton squeezes him into his schedule in between a havanese and an enormous orange tabby with only a little censure. And then Stiles sits on the cold metal table in a back room, swinging his legs, and lets Deaton poke at him and shine a light up his nose and press his hand onto places all over his stomach while Stiles winces and Derek kicks up a constant mild warning growl in the background\u2014it makes Stiles feel sort of warm and fuzzy, and makes Deaton twitch his eyebrows in amusement.</p>\n<p>Stiles clears his throat and says, \u201cDerek doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m rejecting the bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d Deaton says. \u201cOr rather: you didn\u2019t.\u201d He peels down Stiles\u2019s bottom eye-lids and has Stiles track his finger and Stiles is eighty percent sure Deaton is just fucking with him with half this stuff.</p>\n<p>Deaton finally moves back with a sigh and a contemplative frown.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cTell me why I can\u2019t feel my wolf. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not healing fast enough, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe this is simple self-preservation, Mr. Stilinski,\u201d Deaton says. He holds out his hands. \u201cMind accepts new alpha, heart and body do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does that translate to my body killing itself?\u201d Stiles says, incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were experiencing high levels of anxiety and panic attacks, almost certainly gave yourself an ulcer, coupled with a repressed wolf and abuse from your alpha, not\u2014\u201d he holds up a finger as Stiles opens his mouth to protest, \u201c\u2014necessarily always physical. Whatever accelerated healing you experienced was counteracted by any number of these factors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou speculate,\u201d Stiles says, nodding slowly, and Deaton shrugs, snapping off his latex gloves and tossing them into the trash can.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cSafety, freedom to express yourself, and a marked lack of terror should do wonders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Stiles says. He hunches in on himself a little, feeling strangely chastised, even though none of this was his fault.</p>\n<p>Derek moves to stand in front of him, arms crossed. He says, \u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs and says, \u201cAt least I should be okay. So, uh, when does the biting commence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomewhere not here,\u201d Derek says, which is reasonable, even though Stiles is getting more and more anxious the longer they go on <em>without</em> doing it.</p>\n<p>Like Cal will show up out of nowhere and try and stop them. Not that he would. Not that he probably even expected Stiles to come back after what happened, right? He\u2019s kind of useless.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says, dropping heavy paw on his shoulder, voice soft and concerned. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeachy.\u201d Stiles forces a grin, and Derek frowns down at him but doesn\u2019t push.</p>\n<p>Scott turns away from a hushed confab with Deaton and says, \u201cSo, like, not that I\u2019m condoning violence, but can we also beat the shit out of this other alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScotty,\u201d Stiles says, mock scandalized, a hand to his chest.</p>\n<p>Scott smiles at him. He says, \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t <em>have</em> to, but it would probably make me feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Scott nods amiably. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t, but maybe it would make <em>Stiles</em> feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows his immediate <em>yes</em> and really thinks about it. Would it make him feel better to know that Derek\u2019s pack\u2014<em>his</em> pack\u2014has broken a few dozen of Cal\u2019s bones, maybe made him bleed internally for a few hours? Yes. Yes, it would.</p>\n<p>Stiles gives them a thumbs-up and says, \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes and loosens his arms, leaning hands onto the table on either side of Stiles\u2019s hips, and says, \u201cWould you like to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile that is a very fine offer,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cand I reserve all rights to change my mind, I don\u2019t think I ever want to see that asshole again in my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough, bro,\u201d Scott says, and then leans in to give Stiles\u2019s entire head an octopus hug.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They go to Derek\u2019s loft. Stiles feels a little itchy entering what is still technically another pack\u2019s den, but he pushes through it. In another hour or whatever it won\u2019t even matter. Sure.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s fingers twitch nervously and he shoves them through his hair, and then the door is closing behind him and Derek is stalking toward him purposefully and Stiles freezes with one hand up, the other clutching at the front of his jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes glow red and his fangs drop and Stiles backpedals before he can think better of it, spine hitting the back of the sofa.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cSo we\u2019re just doing this? No lead up, just full on\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShow me your eyes,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be a surprise. Hell, it probably won\u2019t even be a deal breaker, given the color of Derek\u2019s eyes before he leveled up. He still doesn\u2019t want to do it. Not before Derek can\u2019t change his mind.</p>\n<p>Stiles screws up his mouth and tilts his chin and glares at Derek until Derek\u2019s eyes melt back to hazel, softening his stance at the same time, curling his hands gently around Stiles\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine. Show me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stutters out an uneven breath, closes his eyes and says, \u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hands leave his arms. One slides down to shackle his wrist, bringing it up to flatten against Derek\u2019s chest. The other touches his face so lightly Stiles jerks back, hitches a shoulder up to rub at the ticklish tingles it leaves behind.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s grip around his wrist tightens a little, and then the fingers are heavier on his cheek, moving swiftly across his head to grip gently on his nape.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s quiet and steady in a way that weirdly calms all Stiles\u2019s nerves, and his eyes flutter open without his say-so. Derek\u2019s close, mouth pulled up in a half smile, eyes a serious gray-green.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Stiles says. It\u2019s a stupid show of defiance over something petty, but he\u2019s pretty sure Derek will let him get away with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Derek says with a small dip of his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of time.\u201d He relaxes his hold on his wrist to cover Stiles\u2019s hand, threading their fingers together as he tugs it away from his chest.</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows hard as Derek raises his arm. He says, \u201cThere?\u201d voice embarrassingly breathy. Cal had bitten him on the ball of his shoulder, hard and painful, fangs sinking so deep it felt like he\u2019d nicked the bone. His wrist is full of delicate muscles and tendons\u2014he feels like there should be a less critical bite point, but all he can think of is, like, a thigh or his ass. Christ.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Derek says, mouth losing all traces of a grin. \u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles musters up some shaky bravado and says, \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>An eyebrow arch says Derek isn\u2019t buying it, but he leans closer anyhow\u2014he keeps his eyes on Stiles and Stiles holds his breath, watching as Derek\u2019s sharp teeth hover over his pulse point. Shit. The waiting is slow and painful and Stiles thinks he might pass out from sheer anticipation.</p>\n<p>He rasps out, \u201cWhat the fuck are you wait\u2014\u201d just as Derek bites him.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t feel like pain. There\u2019s pressure and a buzzing white noise in his ears and the solid thump of his heart, but Derek isn\u2019t a <em>vampire</em>, and he isn\u2019t tearing into his flesh, like Cal did, and Stiles feels a sudden whoosh of euphoria through his body that grows and grows the longer Derek keeps his mouth in place, teeth careful in his skin, lips warm and damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 interesting,\u201d Stiles manages, sagging against the back of the sofa. He really wishes he\u2019d been sitting down for this.</p>\n<p>He licks his lips and tastes salt and realizes he\u2019s kind of crying. When the crying doesn\u2019t really stop it gets <em>really</em> embarrassing. He swipes at his cheeks with his free hand and doesn\u2019t even notice when Derek lets him go.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d and Stiles slumps into his shoulder. Derek takes most of his weight and hugs him and the touching is truly bizarre and also wonderfully comforting.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cI think I need to sit down,\u201d and Derek says, \u201cYou should stay here tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is too wiped to do anything but agree.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up sprawled on top of a warm alpha werewolf feeling incredibly stupid. Oh god. It\u2019s instantaneous\u2014one minute he\u2019s asleep, the next he\u2019s hyperaware of all points of contact, and how his face is buried in Derek\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>Derek murmurs something low, shifting underneath him, and Stiles scrambles backward in a stunningly uncoordinated movement of limbs. He falls off the side of the bed with a thump, and has to cover his burning hot face with his hands when Derek peers over the edge of the mattress at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYeah, sure, fine. Just gonna,\u201d he drops his hands in favor of scuttling backward along the floor like a crab, \u201ccall Scott to give me a ride home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face goes from sleepily amused to frowning to pretty much unreadable in two point four seconds. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d He takes a deep breath and forces himself up onto his feet by the doorway. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says softly.</p>\n<p>Derek sits up, dangles his hands off upraised knees. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes off a laugh. \u201cUh, yeah. I think I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth and Stiles trips over his feet to get out of there before this ends up as some kind of <em>conversation</em>, god, and he throws, \u201cSee you later,\u201d over his shoulder as he thunders barefoot down the spiral stairs. He grabs his shoes and hoodie by the door, dialing Scott before he even reaches the elevator.</p>\n<p>He feels awkward and out of place and ignores the itch at the back of his neck, the stare of his alpha, as he begs Scott to come pick him up at\u2014he checks his phone\u2014six in the goddamn morning. Christ.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The first thing his dad says to him when he stumbles blearily into the house after Scott drops him off is, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not a vampire.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Stiles\u2019s sluggish brain a long moment to remember he\u2019s been home for three days and this is the first time they\u2019ve actually seen each other.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cI don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKid,\u201d his dad says, hooking a hand over the back of his neck and reeling him in for a hug, \u201cyou look even worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m wounded,\u201d Stiles says, voice muffled by his dad\u2019s shirt, \u201cthat you would think anything less than <em>incredibly handsome</em> when seeing your only son.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad sighs and says, \u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFull moon problems,\u201d Stiles says with as much of a shrug as he can manage. \u201cYou might need to get me a flea collar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDog jokes? At your own expense?\u201d His dad steps back, one eyebrow arched. There\u2019s a marked lack of surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott already told you,\u201d Stiles says wearily.</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cScott already told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad looks sad and fond and cages Stiles\u2019s head in his hands. \u201cNever about something like this, kiddo.\u201d And then he lets him go and says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a serious conversation about lying by omission, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans, tries to hide his face, but ends up with his cheeks squished between his dad\u2019s hands again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize I would\u2019ve kicked Hale\u2019s butt for abandoning you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. In retrospect, Stiles thinks Derek probably would have <em>let him</em>, too. \u201cI\u2019m okay now,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>His dad shakes him a little. \u201cFor good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know. Maybe? There\u2019s still a yawning pit of emptiness when he tries to dredge up his wolf. He says, \u201cYeah, of course,\u201d anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you still look like warm death by the end of the week, I\u2019m siccing Melissa on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t look like warm death by the end of the week, but it\u2019s a close call. Struggling with decisions about college, avoiding Derek, eating his weight in pizza: all things he\u2019s gotten well underway by the two week mark, when he\u2019s got just about halfway to the next full moon.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know the only reason Derek\u2019s letting you ignore him is because he feels bad,\u201d Erica says, scaring the crap out of him as she swings through his open window. She cocks a head at his startled look. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles could say <em>of course, dude</em>, but Erica would hear him lying. Ugh. He settles on making a face and spinning back around toward his computer.</p>\n<p>Erica pokes him in the back of the head. She says, \u201cYou\u2019re running with us on the full moon.\u201d It\u2019s not a question.</p>\n<p>He shrugs and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d He was thinking about locking himself in the basement. From previous experience he\u2019s mostly only a danger to himself, but he doesn\u2019t feel like trashing his room either.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only idea,\u201d she says, this time really digging her nail into his skull. He ducks his head and glares at her, but she just smirks. \u201cDerek may be letting you hide now, Stilinksi, but if you don\u2019t come to him <em>then</em>, he\u2019s probably going to just come to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles elbows her in the stomach to get her to back up, and ignores how ominous that sounds. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d she says, and then she\u2019s slinking out the door with a breezy, \u201cHey, Sheriff,\u201d for his dad.\u00a0 His dad arches both his eyebrows as he peeks his head into Stiles\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cI didn\u2019t see her come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe flew in like a harpy,\u201d Stiles says, and Erica\u2019s laughter echoes across the back yard.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that Stiles doesn\u2019t feel a million times better.</p>\n<p>He does.</p>\n<p>He still looks pale and hollow-eyed when he looks at himself in the mirror, but he figures that\u2019s probably just from the darkness that\u2019s eaten away part of his soul. Blue eyes, gaunt face; it\u2019ll just make him even more of a horror show when he finally figures out his wolf. That has to be a thing, right? Accepting, becoming one with his ragey half. There\u2019s a part of him that thinks he should probably ask Derek for help, but he mainly never wants to embarrass himself in front of him again. The whole crying and sleeping all over him thing had been only slightly humiliating.</p>\n<p>The smart move here would be to just nut up and stop avoiding everyone, but instead he decides to do the exact opposite\u2014he\u2019s on the edge of Beacon proper, just inside pack territory, filling up on gas and Cheetos, when everything goes to shit.</p>\n<p>He hears the crunch of multiple feet on gravel, but doesn\u2019t outwardly react. It\u2019s a miracle he even notices, with his senses still being out of whack, but it\u2019s stone quiet and half past midnight, and the bugs are less noisy this late in the season.</p>\n<p>His shoulders tense up as Cal and then Trix and Scarecrow Jim come out of fog and darkness and corner him\u2014he\u2019s trying not to panic, but he\u2019s on the ass end of town, avoiding pack and being <em>stupid</em>, and he hasn\u2019t figured out his senses or shift yet, so this is going to be bad. Not panicking doesn\u2019t exactly work.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Stiles asks, trying to subtly maneuver the jeep between them.</p>\n<p>Jim slumps against the side view mirror, blinks sloe eyes and gives Stiles a slow, toothy grin.</p>\n<p>Trix is all manic energy and clicking claws.</p>\n<p>Cal has his hands in his pockets, legs apart, standing the furthest away from Stiles. He gives him a shrug. \u201cWhat,\u201d he says, \u201cyou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d notice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrankly, dude, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d <em>care</em>.\u201d Stiles tries inching his phone out of his pocket, stepping around the hood.</p>\n<p>Cal looks mock thoughtful for a moment, head cocked. Finally, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s more about appearances. Can\u2019t have the rest of the flock fleeing, can I?\u201d He strolls forward, nudging in between Trix and Jim. \u201cExamples have to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to run, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d get very far. Instead, he says, \u201cThis is Hale pack territory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like it matters,\u201d Cal says, scratching absently at his jaw. \u201cThe once great and mighty Hale pack, reduced to awkward teenagers and a dude with a chip on his shoulder. I don\u2019t know, I think we could take \u2018em.\u201d He arches an eyebrow at Jim. \u201cJimmy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Trix cracks her knuckles. She lunges forward with a snap of her teeth, and Stiles flinches back and drops his phone onto the pavement as she stops short and cackles. Shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Cal says, grinning, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just\u2014\u201d He cuts off abruptly at an echoing howl. Scarecrow Jim slowly straightens up from his slouch.</p>\n<p>Trix, still wearing a manic grin, says, \u201cAre we going to rumble?\u201d</p>\n<p>One howl morphs into multiple ones\u2014they\u2019re rough and angry and worried, and Stiles feels a tingle down his spine. His gums itch and his eyes feel hot and he rolls his shoulders through a low growl, an unfamiliar rumble in his chest. Huh.</p>\n<p>Cal\u2019s amusement fades with each heaving breath Stiles takes. His wolf is large and angry in his head, and Cal\u2019s eyes widen like he can see that. Can see how much Stiles wants to take him apart with blind rage.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s frightening. How it hits him solidly, all at once. He squeezes his eyes shut and growls through his dropped fangs, \u201c<em>Run</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cal forces a laugh and rocks into a fighting stance, Trix and Jim flanking him, and says, \u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of you? You think you can take me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Stiles says. He jerks his head toward where Derek is loping across the asphalt, sleek and vicious. \u201cBut he can.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost comical, the way Cal begs Derek not to kill him and scrambles to limp out of town, tail between his legs. Trix has an exposed bone jutting out of her arm, passed out in a patch of grass where Cal up and left her, and Scarecrow Jim ghosted as soon as the rest of Stiles\u2019s pack showed up. Satisfying, even if Erica\u2019s miffed nobody died.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him because Scott would have sulked all month.\u201d He\u2019s unabashedly naked, and Isaac throws a pair of sweatpants at his head, cackling about Stiles\u2019s delicate sensibilities.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Scott says with an unconcerned shrug, but he\u2019s got blood that isn\u2019t his on his mouth, making him look deranged when he smiles.</p>\n<p>Erica claps Stiles\u2019s shoulder and says, \u201cLook at you, all fangs and claws and no eyebrows. Ready to be a wolf yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs, cheeks hot, and tries to avoid looking directly at Derek. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says to the night sky. \u201cFor, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson kicks at Trix and says, \u201cMan, those guys were assholes. What do we do with this one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cWe were assaulted. I think she needs to be in lock up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles finally jerks his gaze to Derek and finds him staring at him intently. There\u2019s just as much blood on Derek as there is on Scott, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know whether to find that endearing or not.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cYou want to call your dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and says, \u201cThanks,\u201d again, this time to his face.</p>\n<p>Derek looks worried for half a second before his expression drops to bored and bland, like he didn\u2019t just nearly rip another alpha werewolf in half. He says, \u201cYou good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to say, <em>yeah, sure</em>, but ends up saying, \u201cNot really,\u201d instead. Fuck. <em>Please don\u2019t cry again.</em></p>\n<p>And then motherfucking Boyd pulls him into a bear hug and Stiles gives in and buries himself in Boyd\u2019s solid chest. Stiles has never been a recipient of a Boyd hug before\u2014it\u2019s both awkward and fantastic, considering Boyd has about a foot on him all the way around.</p>\n<p>Boyd says, \u201cIf you come to the next pack meeting I\u2019ll make lasagna,\u201d and Stiles manages to get out, \u201cDone,\u201d while still nose-deep in Boyd\u2019s admittedly sweaty t-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Derek says from behind him, and Stiles feels a warm hand on his neck as he peels himself off Boyd, \u201cyou call your dad and I take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d Scott volunteers, and Derek nods at him, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles, suddenly exhausted, lets himself be maneuvered away from Boyd and tucked up into the passenger side of his jeep.</p>\n<p>It only takes a minute for Stiles to realize Derek isn\u2019t really driving him <em>home</em>, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Derek doesn\u2019t say anything either, and while that isn\u2019t exactly unusual, Stiles is pretty sure Derek is angry.</p>\n<p>He amends that to possibly-furious when he leans over Stiles to pop his door open at the loft and says, \u201cOut.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scrambles to obey, then waits on the curb, arms hugged around his chest. He stumbles a step backward as Derek stalks toward him, but makes himself stop and straighten up and hold still. He says, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d <em>sorry</em> is on the tip of his tongue when Derek plasters himself up against him and shoves his face into his neck. Huh.</p>\n<p>Derek says, breath hot and body shuddering, \u201cAre you done hiding now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2026\u201d He brings tentative hands up and around Derek\u2019s back. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God</em>.\u201d He squeezes Stiles until he squeaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no,\u201d Stiles says, and ignores the wetness at the corners of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking mad,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles pats his back and says, \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dick,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, well.\u201d Stiles has had a traumatizing life experience, but okay, yeah. Regularly, he can be kind of a dick.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls back from him and scowls and says again, \u201cAre you done hiding?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Stiles says. He sniffs and shrugs off Derek\u2019s grip and rubs the back of his hand under his nose. \u201cBut I guess you can always come and find me. If you want.\u201d He feels hot all over and Derek\u2019s chest is still <em>super close</em> to his chest and there are all sorts of smells he hadn\u2019t noticed before: wet pavement, dead leaves, pine needles, sap, soap and mint. His wolf is simmering, and he can hear the front door bang shut on a house five blocks away. Cool.</p>\n<p>Derek looks resigned and tired all over and he ushers Stiles toward the building doors with an, \u201cUpstairs. Now,\u201d and Stiles just nods <em>okay</em>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles stands awkwardly in the middle of the loft while Derek disappears into the kitchen nook. He toes off his shoes and thinks about how comfortable the couch looks, and how he can smell orange juice and can hear Derek\u2019s heart beating nice and steady and it just makes him want to slump into himself and go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cSit,\u201d from the other room, and Stiles makes a face and says, \u201cYou\u2019re being awfully bossy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Appearing in the doorway, Derek scowls and says, \u201cSo don\u2019t sit. Stand there until you pass out,\u201d and then he shoves a glass of OJ at him on his way by.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a sip and says, \u201cI could sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, and Stiles can hear the rolls of his eyes in his voice from across the room.</p>\n<p>And somehow all that translates into Stiles and Derek snuggled under a blanket watching reruns of NCIS. Stiles ends up with his head on Derek\u2019s shoulder, legs curled up and knees pressing into Derek\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>Halfway through the second episode Stiles yawns, fiddles with the ends of the blanket, and says, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Derek is slumped all the way down, head tipped back. He rolls his head to the side to blink sleepily at Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles nudges his side. \u201cHow did you know? Tonight? That I needed you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face goes soft and fond. \u201cI\u2019ll always know,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods slowly. \u201cBecause you\u2019re my alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face pinks a little. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek Hale,\u201d Stiles says, narrowing his eyes. \u201cAre you lying to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face pinks even more, and a small, tired smile tugs at his mouth. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a lie, maybe, but it also doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s the full truth. Stiles says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek says ruefully, then reaches out and squeezes Stiles\u2019s hands. \u201cDo you want me to take you home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. He doesn\u2019t have to even think about it.</p>\n<p>Eventually they move from the couch to the bed, and Stiles tells himself it\u2019s not weird unless they make it weird. Stiles strips down to his boxers and t-shirt, Derek opts for pajama pants with no shirt, and it absolutely does not make Stiles\u2019s hands sweat, nope.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t get under the covers until Derek does first, and then he sinks into the mattress so exhausted that the awkwardness doesn\u2019t even register anymore. He\u2019s warm and sleepy and Stiles curls up with his face mashed into the middle of Derek\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles stares at his hands cupped around his coffee mug and watches his claws flick out and in again in fascination. He says, \u201cThis is pretty gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffs, but Stiles can tell he\u2019s amused. He slides a plate of scrambled eggs and bacon just off to the side of Stiles\u2019s arm. \u201cFull moon is in a little over a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hunches his shoulders and says, \u201cI hope I remember it this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>A heavy silence falls, and when Stiles glances up from his mug Derek has his head in his hands, deep breaths making his whole body shudder.</p>\n<p>Derek says, soft and careful, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember the other ones?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles forces a shrug and says, \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Derek\u2019s eyes look watery and sad and <em>oh god</em>, if Derek starts crying about this, Stiles is going to go lock himself in the bathroom for the rest of the day. He says, \u201cGod, Stiles, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws up his hands and says, \u201cStop fucking <em>apologizing</em>, okay? It happened, it sucked, but I\u2019d really like to move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was being a jealous asshole,\u201d Derek says, ignoring him, hands clasped in front of him like a worried little old lady. \u201cI was hurt, and I have no excuse, and I just hope maybe someday you can forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at him and says, \u201cDerek, <em>we\u2019re moving on</em>.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s not forgiveness, exactly, because Stiles isn\u2019t really in a place where he can see how this is Derek\u2019s fault. Logically, he knows he should blame him, he\u2019s been angry and hurt for months, but there\u2019s sort of this numb pall over everything right now, and he\u2019s pretty sure he has to gain some distance before they can hug it out for real.</p>\n<p>Stiles can see the exact moment when Derek goes from over-concerned worrywart to alpha with a plan. Despite everything, it\u2019s nice to see that confident set to his shoulders, and his wolf instantly responds\u2014<em>content, safe, eager</em>.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cAll right,\u201d and, \u201cToday we\u2019re going to work on your control.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Apparently working on his control means running around the preserve like a madman. When they crest a hill that looks down on a narrow creek, Stiles pauses to take a breather and pull dead leaves out of his sneaks.</p>\n<p>He slants Derek\u2019s glistening chest a glance as he comes to a stop next to him and says, \u201cHow is this helping my control?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his shoulders. \u201cHow do you feel? Tired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles shifts back and forth on his feet, muscles aching. His t-shirt\u2019s clinging to his back and his hair is damp with sweat. He mainly feels hot and gross, even in the chilly December air.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut not exhausted,\u201d Derek says, almost smug.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Derek does a quick series of stretches that Stiles tries to imitate, and then gives up halfway through.</p>\n<p>He leans into a tree and swipes his forehead with his arm\u2014a beam of sunlight cuts through the trees, falling directly across Derek\u2019s broad back as he bends at the waist. God. He needs water.</p>\n<p>And then Derek looks up at the sun, hand hovering over his eyes, and says, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s head back. Another five miles and we\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans but straightens up and shakes out all his limbs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a cheeseburger the size of my head when this is done. And fries. And at least three milkshakes. Can we order pizza?\u201d His stomach is a cavernous pit.</p>\n<p>Derek grins at him over his shoulder. \u201cMaybe. If you beat me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles does not beat Derek back to the loft. Obviously. And then it becomes a thing. An exercise thing, where Derek works him until he\u2019s dead on his feet and then lets him curl up on the loft couch in between a bunch of giant hairy wolves.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we talk about shifting?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHow to sprout fur 101?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead, though, Derek has him describe smells, listen for bird calls, and even out his heartbeat as their miles rack up, and soon filtering out all the extra sensory input becomes second nature, as easy as breathing, and Stiles stops at the crest of the same hill he has every single damn day for the past week and says, \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is grinning at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you get good at this shit?\u201d Stiles says. He\u2019s pretty sure Derek taught the other puppies how to change by just throwing them into stuff. \u201cCan I learn how to shift now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek clasps his shoulder and says, \u201cFirst let\u2019s get you through tonight without killing anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s body tenses; he presses his mouth together and stares at his now-ratty shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust,\u201d Stiles shrugs without looking up at him, \u201cdon\u2019t think that was ever a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Derek says, voice low.</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a slow breath. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t <em>remember</em>, all right?\u201d The full moon nights were mainly a blank, afterwards, just impressions of pain and fear. \u201cBut I never had to lock myself up with more than the flimsy chain across my apartment door, and I always woke up bloody and alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets the implication hang\u2014he never really liked thinking too hard about that, anyway.</p>\n<p>After a long silence Derek clears his throat and says, hoarse, \u201cOkay.\u201d Very carefully, he reaches out and slides an arm around Stiles\u2019s shoulders, drawing him in until he\u2019s pressed up against him in a loose hug.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s hands come up almost involuntarily to clutch at Derek\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you tell me this isn\u2019t a big deal I will rip your throat out with my teeth,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a watery laugh. He asks, \u201cCan I be a wolf <em>now</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst lesson,\u201d Derek says into the side of Stiles\u2019s head, \u201cyou already are one.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The afternoon and evening aren\u2019t exactly <em>pleasant</em>, but Stiles is worn out from running, muscles aching instead of itching, and it\u2019s the first full moon he\u2019s not actively dreading. The whole pack shows up for dinner, brimming with extra energy\u2014Erica almost breaks the coffee table wrestling with Jackson, and Stiles can see Malia and Isaac scuffling on the balcony.</p>\n<p>Stiles sits at the kitchen counter, picking at bowl of mac and cheese and says, \u201cShould I be locked up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks up from the sink and frowns. \u201cDo you want to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scratches his throat and says, \u201cNot really? But, like, are we going to run? Am I going to rage-eat baby forest animals?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth blooms into a slow smile. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not amusing, big guy.\u201d He jabs his fork at him. \u201cWhat if I eat Bambi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott drapes himself all over Stiles\u2019s back and says, \u201cI ate a raccoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t even a food animal, Scott!\u201d Stiles says. He turns wide, horrified eyes on Derek again. \u201cWhat if I eat a non-food animal? Like a <em>dog</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flips a dish towel over his shoulder and leans into the counter. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let you eat a dog, Stiles,\u201d he says, smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise?\u201d He holds up his hand. \u201cPinky promise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek eyes him like he\u2019s crazy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me hanging, Derek.\u201d He wiggles his fingers. \u201cPinky promises are sacred.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor five year olds,\u201d Derek says, but he holds out his pinky and wraps it around Stiles\u2019s. His smirk softens and his eyes are fond. \u201cPinky promise. Now, cats, on the other hand\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles twists their hands into a full grip and then leans forward to punch Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he says, and Derek goddamn <em>giggles</em>. It\u2019s bizarre and it makes Stiles\u2019s chest warm and he clears his throat, trying not to stare too hard at Derek\u2019s mouth. Crap.</p>\n<p>Erica bounces up like a toddler and says, \u201cCan we go yet? Can we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glances toward the wall of windows; a deep purple bruise is spreading over the horizon. He arches an eyebrow at Stiles. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever actually be ready, but he nods <em>okay</em>, anyhow.</p>\n<p>They drive to the preserve, four cars in a procession, Stiles riding shotgun in Derek\u2019s mom mobile. They drive right into the sunset, some next-level symbolic bullshit that makes Stiles\u2019s grin, even if all his limbs are starting to feel like they\u2019re on fire. All the zen crap he gained from daily exercise and steady breathing got left behind in the loft, and he has to pry his claws from the door handle when they finally park.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. You\u2019re doing good. Trust yourself,\u201d with one hand firm on his shoulder as he stumbles out of the car.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face and says, \u201cStop talking. Do we have to get naked?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erica whoops from somewhere behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Derek says as five extremely naked bodies go streaking past them, \u201cbut you\u2019d probably ruin your jeans.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t make Derek turn around. Somehow, admitting that he\u2019s not totally comfortable in his skin when everyone else is perfectly fine with stripping would make him feel even more exposed. It\u2019s cold, especially without the sun for company, but he makes sure to stand up straight and tall. Derek\u2019s gaze doesn\u2019t dip below his collarbone, and his small smile doesn\u2019t waver\u2014like he\u2019s <em>proud</em> of him. Stiles pretends that doesn\u2019t make his eyes burn a little.</p>\n<p>Full dark creeps in so slow Stiles hardly notices it. Instead, he sees the flare of red in Derek\u2019s eyes, and hears the howls in the distance.</p>\n<p>In the moonlight, he watches the steady rise and fall of Derek\u2019s bare chest, sees the way his canines flash when he grins.</p>\n<p>Derek could change in an instant. His head tilts like a curious dog, probably listening to his betas scampering deeper into the woods. Stiles knows he\u2019s waiting for him\u2014open stance, no pressure.</p>\n<p>It makes something wild burst open in him, and then next thing he knows he\u2019s eye-height with Derek\u2019s crotch. He yips and backpedals and Derek slumps over in bright, loud laughter, hands on his knees.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cStiles, Christ,\u201d and then wipes his eyes with his palms and straightens up and grins wide at him and says, \u201cLook at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles dips his head and sees too-big paws. He cranes his neck around and sees a fluffed up tail and a haunch that needs scratching. He rubs his nose against a knee and sneezes. <em>Awesome</em>.</p>\n<p>By the time he\u2019s done inspecting every inch he can reach, a big black wolf is sitting there, watching him with an expression that can only be described as smug. He gets to his feet when the beta\u2019s howls grow closer, watching Stiles as he backs up toward the tree line. He yips when Stiles still doesn\u2019t move to follow.</p>\n<p>Finally, Stiles takes a tentative step, leaves rustling under soft paws. It\u2019s weird. He opens his mouth and licks over his nose.</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, then tilts back his head and howls.</p>\n<p>Stiles echoes him automatically, then cuts himself off midway through, startled. Huh.</p>\n<p>Derek dances back again, this time giving the trees a pointed look.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs, sniffs the air. He smells fox, stagnant water, pine sap, and a host of other unfamiliar and familiar scents, ones he\u2019s only known as the woods after rain. He\u2019s going to start a log, he decides. He\u2019s going to figure out how to distinguish every one.</p>\n<p>When he starts paying attention with his eyes again, Derek has disappeared. He takes another big breath, telescopes his ears, and doesn\u2019t feel afraid. He knows exactly how he can find him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles has never felt anything like it: pain free and exhilarated, alert yet exhausted. He shovels an enormous bite of pancake in his mouth and grins with his mouth full across the table at Jackson.</p>\n<p>Jackson says, \u201cClassy, Stilinski,\u201d and Stiles salutes him with his fork, getting syrup all over his nose.</p>\n<p>He wipes it with the back of his hand and doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s basically just making even more of a mess. He feels fantastic.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it always like this?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Erica grunts at him with her face flat on the table.</p>\n<p>Isaac has a coffee mug clutched with white-knuckled fingers under his chin, eyes at half-mast.</p>\n<p>Boyd hasn\u2019t even made it off the pile of blankets on the couch yet.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s the only other one with just as much energy as Stiles, apparently, and they bump fists over the table in solidarity.</p>\n<p>Derek slides another plate of fluffy pancakes on the table and says, \u201cEat up.\u201d He\u2019s shirtless in an apron, threadbare sweats hanging precariously off his hips and frankly spectacular butt.</p>\n<p>Stiles toasts his orange juice to it as he walks away.</p>\n<p>Jackson gives him a baleful look and says, \u201cYou\u2019re in way too good a mood today. Did you hump a log out there in the forest?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles spends a half-second feeling self-conscious before shrugging it off.</p>\n<p>Erica slaps a sleepy hand at Jackson\u2019s face and says, \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole. It\u2019s baby\u2019s first full moon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, it really\u2014\u201d Stiles clams up when Derek appears next to the table again, one eyebrow arched at him. \u201cFirst full moon,\u201d Stiles says, nodding while an approving grin spreads across Derek\u2019s unfairly handsome face. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Boyd groans from his couch cave. \u201cGod, just shut up. Can someone drag me to the bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>The come-down hits Stiles after he\u2019s finished another stack of pancakes. He goes from vibrating livewire to pile of mush so quick he stumbles as he gets up from the table. He immediately goes for Boyd\u2019s abandoned pile of blankets and snuggles in.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s another three or so hours before the pack starts to clear out of the loft, but Stiles doesn\u2019t move from his position on the couch.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cLet me die here,\u201d eyes closed, blanket pulled over his head like a hood. The cushions dip beside him and Stiles glances over to find Derek staring at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek says, then reaches out to squeeze Stiles\u2019s knee. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Stiles says, grinning tiredly.</p>\n<p>Derek grins back and turns away, but Stiles can see the way the tips of his ears go pink. Huh. \u201cSo I guess I should\u2026.\u201d He trails off, then starts to let go of Stiles\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p>Stiles stops him, grabbing onto his fingers loosely. \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek arches an eyebrow at him. \u201cWhat wait?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I don\u2019t even know,\u201d Stiles says, and then he tugs Derek\u2019s hand up and presses Derek\u2019s knuckles under his chin. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth is soft and he slips his hand from Stiles\u2019s grip only to cup a palm around his cheek. \u201cNot really,\u201d he murmurs, and then he leans in and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Stiles flails and internally panics for a second or five, despite the fact that he basically <em>initiated the face touching</em>. It\u2019s still a shock, maybe, to find out that Derek actually wants to put his mouth on his mouth. That that is a thing that is currently happening.</p>\n<p>Or not, since Derek\u2019s pulling away, brows furrowed, and Stiles has to grab onto Derek\u2019s face to keep him close.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Derek blinks, but doesn\u2019t fight out of Stiles\u2019s hold. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to end horribly,\u201d Stiles says, but slowly brushes his nose up against Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m capable of making good decisions,\u201d Derek says, sounding mildly affronted. The apples of his cheeks flash up, though, like he\u2019s smiling, and Stiles focuses on the cute little crinkles at the edges of Derek\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Derek is capable of making <em>terrible</em> decisions, Stiles\u2019s situation a case in point, but there\u2019s been enough apologizing for that. Stiles doesn\u2019t really want to bring it up right now, when all he really wants to do is crawl into Derek\u2019s lap and use him as a pillow.</p>\n<p>Stiles equivocates with, \u201cSometimes you\u2019re okay,\u201d and then follows up with a soft press of mouths, Derek tensing underneath him like he didn\u2019t actually think Stiles was going reciprocate.</p>\n<p>And then Stiles pulls back, grinning, and Derek shakes his head on a slow smile. One second they\u2019re staring fondly at each other like idiots, the next Derek is reaching into Stiles\u2019s cuddle pile. He scoops Stiles up at the waist and gets up off the couch in one smooth movement, leaving Stiles to yelp and clutch onto the back of his shirt as he\u2019s hefted over Derek\u2019s shoulder, tangled blankets dangling from his hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Stiles says, nearly breathless.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cI\u2019ll show you a good decision, Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs a laugh. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t actually a challenge, but I\u2019m not going to complain.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, bro, you can do this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at Scott, but Scott just buries his hands in Isaac\u2019s scruff and grins.</p>\n<p>Everyone but Scott and Stiles has their fur coats on, sprawled out in the sun flooding through the large loft windows. Derek has his head resting over Boyd\u2019s back, watching him.</p>\n<p>Stiles hasn\u2019t changed outside the full moon yet. He\u2019s managed a beta shift, so <em>yay</em> <em>progress</em>, but the thought of consciously pushing himself into a wolf makes him tense up in anticipated pain.</p>\n<p>Scott squeezes his arm. \u201cIt only feels weird for, like, a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Stiles says, making a face. He\u2019s seen every single one of their bodies crack and reform; it looks both grotesque and terrifying. The only problem is that the puppy piles look <em>amazing</em>, and also Erica will probably make fun of him for the rest of his life if he can\u2019t get this down.</p>\n<p>He squares his shoulders and takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>Scott says, \u201cPicture your wolf in your mind,\u201d and cocks his head, squinting. \u201cKinda scrawny and scruffy, but, like, with a mean edge? Like you\u2019d fight really dirty if you had to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Stiles says, and finds himself picturing Wile E. Coyote instead. \u201cThat really helps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott claps his back.</p>\n<p>Stiles closes his eyes and thinks: <em>feral dog, possible mange, big teeth</em>.</p>\n<p>Miraculously, it fucking works.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never felt anything like it, but Scott\u2019s right: it doesn\u2019t actually hurt.</p>\n<p>Bad news, he forgot to take off his pants. Man, he really liked those jeans. He kicks off the ripped remains of denim and\u2014<em>aw, crap</em>, his Hulk boxers. Damn it.</p>\n<p>Scott looks like all of his dreams came true, though, and he drops to his knees and throws his arms around Stiles\u2019s now-furry neck. \u201cSee, easy!\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs, but leans into the hug anyway.</p>\n<p>And then Scott says, \u201cOkay, me next,\u201d and lets Stiles go to start stripping off all his clothes. Stiles gets a snout full of Scott-crotch and sneezes\u2014<em>so gross, dude</em>.</p>\n<p>Derek woofs softly to get his attention, and Stiles perks up and pads over on his stupidly big paws. He\u2019s over twenty, shouldn\u2019t he already be filled out? Derek licks at his muzzle when he\u2019s close enough, then tugs on an ear and whines while Boyd, long suffering, rolls onto his side to make room for Stiles to snuggle in.</p>\n<p>Erica bares her teeth at him from Derek\u2019s other side and Jackson mule-kicks the side of his face with a back paw, accidentally on purpose.</p>\n<p>Stiles snaps at him.</p>\n<p>Scott bounds over and jumps on top of his back.</p>\n<p>Somehow Stiles ends up underneath a huddle of wolves, the tip of his nose touching Derek\u2019s. It\u2019s grounding in a way he didn\u2019t expect, the last of his anxiety slipping away. He\u2019s sleepy and warm and <em>not alone</em> and he closes his eyes, content.</p>\n<p><em>Wolfy kiss</em>, he thinks, as Derek licks under his jaw, and falls asleep.</p>"
