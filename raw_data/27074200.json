  "notes": "<p>This fic will be split into two chapters. I'm actually already done writing the other half, it's just in the process of being edited and beta-read. Once that's done, it'll be up, most likely by tomorrow! So, that's about it. Peace.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>This fic was written for three reasons:</p>\n<p>First, to share the painful process of making sense of who you are when you were raised in an environment that told you who you are is wrong. And how sometimes, the people we love most who were raised the same way, will struggle to accept you as well. And the journey of unlearning is long and hard, but not undoable if done with love.</p>\n<p>Second, inspiration from a novel called The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo which shook me to my fucking core and gave me a better understanding of myself and the LGBT community.</p>\n<p>Third, because this year, at age twenty-one, I came out to my friends, some of my family, and to myself - as a lesbian. </p>\n<p>Everything is so much better but everything is also still scary, even right now. But I hope everyone who is currently in the same place as Sakusa was, or in the same place that I was, you get something good from this story. One day, we'll all get there. Hell, I still have to convince myself of that sometimes, so we're in this together!</p>\n<p>There's no point in living a life that isn't true.</p>",

But really. Ready? \u2018Ya gotta kiss the groom, y\u2019know? It\u2019s gonna be fuckin\u2019 gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs deeply and they both ignore how badly he\u2019s trembling.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Osamu says. \u201cBecause Tsumu\u2019s already cryin\u2019 and we haven\u2019t even gotten to the walkin\u2019 down the aisle part yet. One of ya has to have their shit together out there and God knows it ain\u2019t gonna be him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa shakes his head as if disappointed, but the fond smile on his face betrays it. \u201cHe\u2019s hopeless. Go back to your twin. He needs you more than I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu nods. He turns around, pauses, and without looking at Sakusa, asks,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take care of him, won\u2019t ya? I\u2019m pretty much entrustin\u2019 my whole life to you too, y\u2019know? Ya promise to take care of him?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence after that question, a weighty one that only they would understand, before he answers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa watches the way Osamu\u2019s hand squeezes the doorknob before he nods slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll hold ya to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>As the door clicks shut, he\u2019s left standing in front of the full body mirror.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a moment to give himself a look over. Letting his eyes roam from his carefully styled hair, light makeup, and fancy tux, he\u2019s reminded once again, that he\u2019s actually getting married.</p>\n<p>To Miya fucking Atsumu.</p>\n<p>He kind of wanted to laugh and say, <em> who would\u2019ve fucking thought? </em>But he also kind of thought that maybe, from the moment he first laid his eyes on him all those years ago, he already knew it could never be anyone but him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it was having that knowledge, that <em> gut feeling, </em>from the very first time they met, that made everything as terrifying as it was.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was just that Sakusa fell too deeply too fast and <em> that </em> was why he tried everything in his power to stop it from happening. And yet even then, nothing could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>God knows he tried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa sighs heavily, turning around to face his cousin. \u201cKomori, call me that again and I\u2019ll skin you alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori grins at him, excitedly skipping his way over, and throwing an arm around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d He beams, \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite himself, Sakusa can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI do love you, I guess. And I\u2019m proud of me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Who would\u2019ve thought?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking back at how it all was back then, who would\u2019ve fucking thought?<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> <strong>T MINUS 11 YEARS BEFORE THE WEDDING</strong> </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa Kiyoomi grew up as an only child raised by two very religious and very strict parents. Which was, in a lot of ways, fucking hilarious, because he grew up becoming absolutely nothing like how they wanted him to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His favorite childhood story will always be the day he apparently spoke for the first time. His dad had been carrying him in his arms and trying to convince him to say the word \u2018<em> Dada\u2019 </em>for a full thirty minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, little Sakusa opened his mouth, took a breath, and in the sweetest, tiniest voice they\u2019d ever heard coming from a baby boy, said,</p>\n<p>\u201cNo \u2764\ufe0f\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the perfect foreshadowing of the rest of the shit his parents were going to be up against as he grew older. Which is why, like Sakusa said, it was his favorite childhood story. He kind of applauded his one year old self.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His one year old self who was able to say no to his father without a hint of fear or hesitation, was to this day, the bravest he\u2019d ever been.</p>\n<p>Sakusa Kiyoomi grew up studying in an all-boys school where priests controlled more than taught. He learned at an early age to love your neighbor as you love yourself, do not rape, do not steal, be faithful to your spouse, and also don\u2019t eat meat during Holy Week and don\u2019t be gay?\u00a0</p>\n<p>(He didn\u2019t really get those last ones. Why the hell did Jesus care about meat during that one particular week and what did he have against gay people? He\u2019s the one who made them. They\u2019re straight up vibing.)</p>\n<p>Sakusa Kiyoomi was fifteen the first time he saw Miya Atsumu across a volleyball net.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair the ugly color of mustard, a cocky smile, and the thickest pair of thighs he had ever seen on a boy his age, covered in sweat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing he remembers thinking at that moment, as the whistle blew signaling the first serve, staring at Miya Atsumu as Miya Atsumu stared back at him, was one of the first things he learned in elementary school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Gay people go to hell.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Sakusa Kiyoomi is fifteen when he first lays his eyes on Miya Atsumu and learns that in this world, he was allowed to be absolutely anything but himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu grew up as a twin brother. The <em> better, more good-looking, more talented </em>twin brother, as he\u2019d always said. Osamu didn\u2019t really care what he said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Whatever the hell makes ya sleep at night, Tsumu.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>Their parents loved them, spoiled them, Atsumu with all the comic books he wanted and Osamu with all the snacks he wanted. And in return, the twins paid them back with love and volleyball awards. I mean, they also paid them back with screaming matches and terrible temper tantrums but there was always love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s favorite childhood story is the same as Osamu\u2019s favorite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been about eight when their parents had left them at home for an hour to go grocery shopping, which was a mistake on their part. In their defense though, the twins had always been fairly independent and trustworthy (in <em> some </em>ways) and it\u2019s not like they knew their sons would take that once in a lifetime opportunity to watch porn for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few minutes in, Osamu pressed the pause button and turned to look at his brother, looking slightly constipated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it weird that I liked lookin\u2019 at the boy more than the girl?\u201d Osamu asked in a hushed, panicked whisper. \u201cTsumu, I ain\u2019t weird, am I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu wrapped an arm around him and squeezed lightly, shaking his head. \u201cCourse not, Samu. You couldn\u2019t be weird.\u201d He says, sounding so sure of himself, \u201c\u2018Cause I liked lookin\u2019 at him too. I mean, I liked lookin\u2019 at both of them, but him a little more, ya know? And I ain\u2019t weird. So you ain\u2019t weird either.\u201d</p>\n<p>After sharing a hug, they end up arguing over how the hell you delete the browser history.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re ten years old when they\u2019re finally able to put a name to the feeling. They\u2019re twelve years old when they\u2019re able to say it out loud and call themselves what they are without feeling unsure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Miya Osamu, gay. Miya Atsumu, bisexual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their mother cries and hugs them both, telling them she\u2019ll love them no matter what. Their father\u2019s eyes widen and he points excitedly at his wife exclaiming, \u201cSee, I knew it. I knew it! Honey, you owe me a new office chair!\u201d</p>\n<p>After they come out to the only people who really matter, they don\u2019t have an issue coming out to anyone else. Sometimes, it went well. Sometimes, it went terribly. That\u2019s just how the world worked, they learned at the tender age of twelve. And as time went on, it\u2019s something they accepted and got used to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At an early age, they learned that this would be the rest of their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whoever stayed, they\u2019d be grateful for. Whoever chose to step out of their lives because of it, didn\u2019t deserve to be there in the first place. That\u2019s what their parents had told them and what they learned to believe as true.</p>\n<p>Which is why by the time they\u2019re in middle school having to coming out for the fiftieth time and are told by some skinny kid, \u201cYou know, gay people go to hell!\u201d He is answered with nothing but a shrug from both twins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu thinks, <em> I mean, yesterday I made Osamu sit in on my Biology exam for me \u2018cause I didn\u2019t study, so if I\u2019m going to hell, it\u2019ll probably be for that. </em></p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu is fifteen when he first sees Sakusa Kiyoomi across a volleyball net.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That day, as the whistle blows signalling his first serve, as he stares at Sakusa Kiyoomi and Sakusa Kiyoomi stares back at him, he learns what the word <em> beautiful </em>really means.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They shake hands at the end of the match. Itachiyama managed to beat Inarizaki and become champions, but it was a fairly close match.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were good enough to make it a challenge. <em> He </em>was outstanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Sakusa stands in front of Atsumu, their hands outstretched, there seems to be a moment of hesitation that comes over the both of them.</p>\n<p>Atsumu is the first to break it, taking the other\u2019s hand and shaking it firmly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood game, yeah?\u201d He says, a cocky smile on his face. He has a strong Kansai dialect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa swallows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He answered, before turning away in a hurry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that night, when Sakusa lies in bed, he pumps and strokes and thinks of a face and the sound of a particular voice speaking in a particular dialect. He comes twice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then, he cries for a very, very long time.</p>\n<p>The next time he receives a confession from a girl he barely knows, for the first time after years of giving out different forms of cold rejection, he says yes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks, <em> this is the only way I\u2019m allowed to live and it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll allow myself to live. </em></p>\n<p>Nobody needs to know whose name he moans in the depths of the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lasts a year with her and in a surprising but not really surprising turn of events, she\u2019s the one who breaks up with him over the fact that he apparently loved volleyball more than her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that. She wasn\u2019t exactly wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s upset but he realizes that what he was feeling wasn\u2019t heartbreak, but defeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sighs and thinks, well, at least I don\u2019t have to pretend to enjoy making out with her anymore.</p>\n<p>And then he thinks, wow, that is <em> fucked up.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only person he tells is Komori. The only person he knew he could trust was Komori.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>I think I\u2019m gay, </em> he says one night during a sleepover. His cousin is silent for a long time before resting a hand on his knee and saying, <em> thank you for telling me. </em></p>\n<p>He tears up a little and Komori says nothing, just leaves his hand on his knee, and then squeezes it once he\u2019s okay.</p>\n<p>Komori was the first person who made him feel like maybe, just maybe, someday it would be okay. It <em> could </em> be okay. Even during the days that his school makes him forget, even during the days his parents say things that make him forget, he forces himself to remember Komori\u2019s reassuring smile and hand on his knee and it\u2019s what gets him through when nothing else seems to work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Miya Atsumu a few more times since the first time and every single time, always through a volleyball net, he feels a surge of anger and resentment that\u2019s hard to keep down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu could probably tell. He always looked annoyingly amused whenever Sakusa snapped at him, as if everything was just a fucking joke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would never understand.</p>\n<p>Every time he saw him, all Sakusa could think was, <em> this is all your fault.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> This is your fucking fault. Give me back the normal life you cost me. Take responsibility.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b> <em>T MINUS 2 HOURS TO THE WEDDING</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Osamu opens the doors, the first thing he hears is the word <em> \u2018SUNARIIIIIIIIN\u2019 </em>in the form of a sob.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing he sees is his brother on his knees, crying so hard that he\u2019s ruining his makeup that\u2019s been retouched twice, as Suna tiredly wiped his tears away with a tissue.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu, please, ya fuckin\u2019 drama queen,\u201d Suna begs, cringing at the residue left on the tissue. \u201cYer gettin\u2019 married in a few hours, get it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> caaaaaaan\u2019t,\u201d </em> He cries, \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 so <em> happy. </em> I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 married, Rin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Osamu says, finally making his presence known, kneeling down by Suna and his brother. \u201cFor cryin\u2019 out loud, Tsumu. Yer bein\u2019 a mess. Don\u2019t expect me to cover for you out there if ya can\u2019t get it together. I stepped in for yer Biology exam but I ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 married in yer place, ya hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sniffs and pouts as Osamu grabs the tissue in Suna\u2019s hand and takes charge of looking after him the way he has his whole life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s relieved he has Sakusa to take over that role now. But a part of him can\u2019t help but feel a little left behind. He\u2019s always been Atsumu\u2019s other half. He\u2019s always been The Other Miya.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, <em> maybe </em> he was still in the middle of trying to accept that that\u2019s about to change. Sue him.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s a twin thing but Atsumu seems to pick up on it immediately and stops crying to throw his arms around his brother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu grunts and tries to push him off but Atsumu only hugs him tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off me, ya scrub.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cI love ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu tries not to start crying too. \u201cYa should, after everythin\u2019 I\u2019ve done for ya. Now, go get yer makeup done again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes a tiny noise of confirmation and peels himself off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love ya.\u201d He repeats. \u201cSay it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love ya.\u201d Osamu relents. \u201cGo get yer makeup fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu stands up, smoothing his tux down, and glances at his brother and Suna.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two aren\u2019t gonna kill each other on my wedding day, are ya?\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna rolls his eyes and Osamu does the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse not.\u201d Suna scoffs, punching Atsumu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it tomorrow. The fuck d\u2019ya take us for, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks them both over for a second longer before nodding and giving them both a shaky smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSap.\u201d Osamu deadpans. \u201cI said go get yer makeup fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finally does.</p>\n<p>Osamu and Suna stay planted in their positions for a while, watching Atsumu go, before turning to look at each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s awkward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always been, the past months they\u2019d had to be left with each other, but it\u2019s warm just the same.</p>\n<p>Suna shoves him lightly with his elbow. \u201cHow\u2019re ya feelin\u2019? He\u2019s gettin\u2019 married before you. Who woulda thought there was someone out there crazy enough to take him on, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>A very small part of Osamu thinks, <em> it could\u2019ve been me. </em>But he pushes that very small voice down and instead says, \u201cSakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s always been fuckin\u2019 insane, though. Tsumu\u2019s just a part of why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna hums. \u201cThose two\u2026 are changin\u2019 the fuckin\u2019 world, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu crosses his arms in front of his chest, exhales deeply. \u201cTwo of the most famous volleyball players in the god damn country\u2019re about to get married, Rin. And they\u2019re fuckin\u2019 gay. Doesn\u2019t get any more world changin\u2019 than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho woulda thought back then, y\u2019know?\u201d Suna muses. \u201cThat this could happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho woulda thought?\u201d Osamu echoes, voice nearly a whisper.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em> <strong>T MINUS 10 YEARS BEFORE THE WEDDING</strong> </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa was chosen to join the Japan All Youth Training Camp. His parents are over the fucking moon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been on his case ever since he and his girlfriend broke up. He couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for them. They\u2019d been trying to cheer him up for months when he didn\u2019t even need any cheering up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You know what <em> would </em> cheer him up? Being able to come out without the threat of getting kicked out of his home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or maybe like, some new gloves would be nice. Maybe he could tell them to buy him some fancy looking gloves. Black ones instead of white. The power those would hold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d probably give him whatever the fuck he asked for right now with the way they were bragging about him to their snotty rich friends. Maybe he should just come out now while they\u2019re at a high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like, <em> guys, thanks for all the support, I\u2019m great, aren\u2019t I? Top 3 in the nation, that\u2019s me! Road to sports scholarship! You proud? You should be. Oh and by the way, I\u2019m gay.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>They couldn\u2019t get mad at that, could they?</p>\n<p>Komori is invited too. So, that\u2019s one concern out of the way. At least he\u2019d have one person there who he knew he could tolerate. Hopefully, they have the luxury of choosing their roommates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night before he leaves for the training camp, he\u2019s forced into another one of their family bonding evenings. His mom started them ever since he\u2019d told them about his breakup. He\u2019s not quite sure how this counted as bonding, though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The TV was on but it was on the news channel, his mom was reading some romance novel, his dad was on his laptop, and he honestly just wanted to go upstairs and take a long, hot shower before packing up.</p>\n<p>The last straw is when the news starts talking about a high school senior who\u2019d committed suicide. Apparently, he\u2019d left a note where it implied that he did it because he was gay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s <em> very </em> comforting. That sure didn\u2019t make him wanna throw up.</p>\n<p>Sakusa shoves his hands in the pockets of his sweatpants, hiding the fact that they were starting to tremble.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoor kid.\u201d His mom sighs, shaking her head, \u201cHis parents should\u2019ve done something about it when he was younger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to change when you start them young.\u201d His dad adds.</p>\n<p>Sakusa gulps. \u201cIs that really something you can change?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, you can.\u201d His dad answers, sounding so sure of himself, that it almost convinces him too. \u201cYou can change anything about yourself as long as you work hard enough. Especially, if they\u2019re things that aren\u2019t good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa wondered how exactly that worked. What exactly he had to do to\u2026 <em> change. </em>He\u2019d already tried everything he could think of.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The journey involved lots of movies, porn, staring at girls to see if there\u2019s something, <em> anything, </em>that could make him feel something more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(It probably made him look like a pervert and it probably freaked some of them out. He\u2019s sorry for that.)</p>\n<p>Hell, he even dated a girl for a whole year. All <em> that </em> proved was that he couldn\u2019t fucking do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Girls are pretty. They\u2019re cute, they\u2019re soft, and they weren\u2019t hard on the eyes. He liked looking at them and he liked talking to some of them. But that\u2019s all it was and all he felt that it ever could be. He dated a girl for an entire god damn year and yet he couldn\u2019t feel for her even <em> half </em> of what he felt for Yamazaki Kento or Tom Holland or fucking...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu. God damn him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t even talk to any of these people. Two were celebrities. He barely even got to see Atsumu, and their longest conversation lasted two minutes and consisted of nothing but swear words and declarations of war. And yet, he would\u2019ve given his girlfriend away for a chance at nipping at those god forsaken thighs just once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Change? How the fuck was he supposed to just change? If he knew, he would\u2019ve done it by now.</p>\n<p>He looked at the TV screen, at the picture of an eighteen year old boy, just two years older than him, who\u2019d taken his own life because he couldn\u2019t bear the weight of who he was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks, <em> if I can\u2019t make myself change, is that all I\u2019ll have left? </em></p>\n<p>He stands up at that thought, turning for the stairs hurriedly. He tastes bile in the back of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, Samu. Why aren\u2019t ya more upset?\u201d Atsumu exclaimed, hands on his hips as he stared at his brother\u2019s hunched back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> am </em>upset.\u201d Osamu retorts tiredly. \u201cBut if anything\u2026 I\u2019m upset that I\u2019m not as upset as I thought I\u2019d be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu was invited to the All Youth Training Camp. Osamu wasn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two have always had an intense rivalry growing up. When every single person you know associates you with another, barely ever seeing you as your own person, you tend to compensate in any way you know how.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both of them strive to be better than the other, more talented, more skilled, more muscular, smarter, stronger, <em> anything. </em> And in turn, despite all the bruises, fights, and screaming matches, they push each other past their limits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They push each other to be <em> better.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Secretly, deep down, that\u2019s all they really wanted for each other.</p>\n<p>Atsumu, despite being cocky and competitive, especially when it came to his twin, didn\u2019t fucking like playing volleyball without him. It\u2019s the only way he\u2019d ever played and the only way he ever planned to play. And he\u2019d always seen it as a given that Osamu felt the exact same way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d be playing volleyball together for the rest of their lives and that\u2019s the only future Atsumu ever saw.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Not as upset as he thinks he should be?\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Atsumu sees red.</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu. What the fuckin\u2019 hell s\u2019that supposed to mean?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means,\u201d Osamu says, after he finishes tying his shoes, standing up to face him, \u201cI think that skill-wise, we\u2019re pretty much on the same level,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, m\u2019still head \u2018n shoulders above ya.\u201d Atsumu scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me finish, ya scrub.\u201d Osamu huffs. \u201cI <em> said, </em>skill-wise, I think we\u2019re about the same. But, when it comes to love for the game? That fire\u2019s a little brighter in you than it ever was in me, Tsumu.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu can sort of read between the lines of what his brother is saying. He doesn\u2019t wanna admit it. Instead, he turns away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s lame.\u201d He simply says, \u201cWho the fuck am I s\u2019posed to room with, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu raises his eyebrows, mouth forming a smirk. \u201cY\u2019know... Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s probably gonna be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Samu.\u201d Atsumu says under his breath. \u201cJust\u2026 shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour toss was too low, Miya.\u201d Sakusa deadpans.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it fuckin\u2019 wasn\u2019t.\u201d Atsumu spits out, venomously. \u201cYou\u2019ve been on my case the entire goddamn time we\u2019ve been paired together. What\u2019s yer problem, huh, Omi? What\u2019s up yer fuckin\u2019 ass?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Too low, </em> his ass. He was crowned the best setter in high school volleyball for a reason. And Sakusa Kiyoomi may be hot but he wasn\u2019t going to take <em> anyone </em> talking shit about his sets sitting down.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop calling me Omi.\u201d Sakusa says between gritted teeth paired with a vicious glare. If Atsumu weren\u2019t Atsumu, he\u2019d be intimidated. \u201cI told you to call me Sakusa, is that so hard to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa\u2019s too long, s\u2019a fuckin\u2019 mouthful, is what it is.\u201d Atsumu says playing with the ball in his hands. \u201cOmi\u2019s cute. Omi\u2019s the nickname yer bein\u2019 given by the best setter in the nation, so jus\u2019 be grateful \u2018n fuckin\u2019 nail my sets, ya hear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou being the best setter in the nation means <em> shit </em>to me.\u201d He retorts. \u201cI\u2019m the best ace. Give me the fucking sets I want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu would be so god damn upset right now if he wasn\u2019t equally turned on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he tosses the ball again, higher this time, a little further from the net, two thoughts go through his head.</p>\n<p><em> First, </em> was there even the slightest possibility that Sakusa Kiyoomi could be gay?</p>\n<p><em> Second, </em> if he was, was there even the slightest possibility that he\u2019d be up for a few rounds of hate fucking?</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019d never experienced any form of fucking but that was starting to sound like a great place to start.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa nails his spike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gives Atsumu a flat look. \u201cNow, was that so hard to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, Atsumu could name something hard right about now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being gay and sixteen was tough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being gay and sixteen in front of someone this good looking was not helping his case.</p>\n<p>He smiles his signature cocky smile. \u201cYou were hittin\u2019 my other sets just fine, Omi-Omi. You hit all my sets perfectly, so ya don\u2019t needa be so cranky all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi-Omi\u2026\u201d Sakusa repeats to himself, as if questioning his entire existence, slowly turning around to walk away and get a drink. \u201cFucking\u2026 Omi-Omi\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu cocks his head.</p>\n<p>He feels a presence behind him and turns around, recognizing the face to be someone named Komori. A guy from Omi\u2019s team.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you broke him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu thinks, <em> no, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the other way around. </em></p>\n<p>He crouches down, hides his face in his knees, and screams a little bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This just had to be the cherry on top of Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s long day, long week, long fucking <em> life. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo, which d\u2019ya prefer, Omi-Omi?\u201d Atsumu asks, in that flippant way he always does, motioning to their shared bunk bed for the next few days. \u201cTop or bottom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns to look at him and Atsumu\u2019s staring at him with one eyebrow raised, a knowing smirk playing on his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knew what he was doing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh god, he fucking <em> knew </em>what he was doing, didn\u2019t he? Those rumors he\u2019d heard from the players that Atsumu was gay were true, weren\u2019t they?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause.</p>\n<p>\n<em> This is a problem. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a minute.\u201d Sakusa says, dropping his bags on the floor. He walks to the bathroom, gently closes the door behind him, turns the lock, sinks down into a crouch, bunches up the lower half of his sweater, bites into it, and screams into the wool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath. In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be <em> fine. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he clicks the door back open, he hears Atsumu\u2019s voice, probably talking to someone on the phone as he says, \u201c- and we\u2019re <em> roommates. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A voice in Sakusa\u2019s core memory goes, <em> oh my god, they were roommates.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBoth.\u201d He speaks up, making Atsumu jump, reflexively hanging up on whoever he was talking to. Probably his twin, if Sakusa had to make a guess.</p>\n<p>Atsumu visibly swallows. \u201cWhat was that, Omi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Two can play at this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At least for this week, when it\u2019s just the two of them, in the privacy of these four walls, he can allow himself to play at this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe, it\u2019s the only time in his life he\u2019ll ever get to play.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with both.\u201d Sakusa clarifies, walking up to Atsumu with his chin tilted up, as if challenging him, taking the opportunity to let his eyes roam over his facial features.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTop or bottom. I\u2019m leaving the choice to you, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes in a shaky breath, licking his lips at their sheer closeness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cU-uh\u2026\u201d <em> Get your shit together, Miya Atsumu, Samu would be disappointed in you right now.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He steels himself and looks Sakusa straight in the eye, making sure he sounds as suggestive as he possibly can when he says, \u201cI\u2019ll take bottom then. Top\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a look in Sakusa\u2019s eyes at that moment, behind the brave front he was putting up, which was how Atsumu could tell that he was just as affected by him as he was by Sakusa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Atsumu thinks back to his earlier thought process, <em> was there even the slightest possibility that Sakusa Kiyoomi could be gay, </em> and the answer is yes. There was now, at least, a 50% chance that he was. Maybe even higher.)</p>\n<p>The boy merely nods, reaching for one of his bags, to start unpacking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can switch whenever you\u2019d like, though.\u201d Atsumu adds for good measure, flopping down onto his temporary bed. \u201cI kinda wanna get the feel of both, y\u2019know what I mean, Omi-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu isn\u2019t sure if he just imagines it, but he thinks he hears a choking sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Okay, maybe 60%.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think Miya\u2019s gay?\u201d Sakusa asks unprompted, as they eat their lunch.</p>\n<p>Komori chokes on broccoli. \u201cI\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s gay.\u201d He repeats, as if this was a very normal conversation to be having with Sakusa Kiyoomi.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Komori starts, slowly putting his utensils down, clasping his hands together, \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026 heard certain rumors but I wouldn\u2019t know if they\u2019re true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa hums, staring into nothing.</p>\n<p>Komori realizes he\u2019s treading on tough waters here, but he has to ask. \u201cWhy, do you\u2026 like him or something?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t look disgusted, doesn\u2019t deny it vehemently, doesn\u2019t even seem to be surprised at the question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori tilts his head, thinks, <em> this is\u2026 new. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sakusa says finally, after seemingly giving it some thought. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence between the two as they continue eating their lunches. What breaks it is,</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to hate someone\u2019s guts so much that you want to have sex with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori actually chokes for real this time. A few rice particles fly onto the table and Sakusa visibly grimaces, backing away.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cDude.\u201d </em> Komori sputters. \u201cWhat the <em> hell.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa continues to stare at him with a deadpan expression, as if this wasn\u2019t the most jarring thing to have ever come out of his cousin\u2019s mouth. This was <em> not </em> a conversation Komori thought they would ever be having.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sakusa asks, looking genuinely confused and slightly displeased. \u201cIs that\u2026 not a thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Komori hesitates, \u201cIt\u2019s <em> definitely </em>a thing. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t expect to get that image of you and him... in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa cringes. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re quiet for even longer after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori thinks about how terrified Sakusa looked that night he came out to him. That was probably the first and only time he\u2019d ever even said it out loud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also thinks about how that was the first and only time he\u2019d ever seen his cousin cry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks at the Sakusa in front of him now, eating chicken breast so casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just talked about wanting to have sex with Miya Atsumu. That was some growth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He figured it had a lot to do with the fact that this was gonna be the longest time so far in his life that he\u2019ll be away from the watchful eyes of his family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Add the fact of who his roommate was gonna be for the next four days.</p>\n<p>Komori couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine what it must be like to live your life knowing who you are and not being able to do anything about it. Komori wished he could\u2019ve told him that night that, <em> you\u2019ll be okay, you\u2019ll be safe, be yourself, don\u2019t be afraid </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d be lying.</p>\n<p>He knew the world they lived in. He knew the type of person Sakusa Kiyoomi was.</p>\n<p>He knew Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s parents.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Miya Twins always had gay rumors. Being athletes, a lot of people saw it as hot gossip. Komori had been hearing about it for years, but never cared enough to go out of his way to find out if it was true.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, Komori was pretty damn sure either twin would tell the truth if people would just ask instead of whisper behind their backs. Homophobia and toxic masculinity were pretty damn rampant in the sports scene, hence the trash talking, but no one seemed to have the actual guts to go up to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were probably too scared to face the truth.</p>\n<p>The truth that either of them being gay didn\u2019t change and would never change the fact that they were still and always will be, two of the greatest players in high school volleyball.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori smiled to himself when he thought about the fact that Sakusa was on the same boat. The toxic straight men would lose their damn minds.</p>\n<p>It was only after seeing the way Atsumu acted around his cousin (and also around that genius setter from Karasuno\u2026 Kageyama, was it? Atsumu talked to that guy like he wanted to eat him up, or something.) that he thought to himself, huh\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Maybe. Most likely, honestly. </em>\n</p>\n<p>If Sakusa was drawn to him, and Atsumu was drawn to him back, and if they were roommates, then\u2026</p>\n<p>Then, maybe...</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can let yourself live a little, Sakusa.\u201d Komori says, without raising his head to look at him. \u201cLet yourself live\u2026 even if it\u2019s just for a little while. Even if it\u2019s just for now. It\u2019s okay to just... feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sees Sakusa\u2019s fists clench against the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Komori continues, voice low and sincere. \u201cNot a fucking soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>A promise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI just want you to be happy. <em> Somehow.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>A few long seconds pass before Sakusa speaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes pride in the fact that his voice is only <em> slightly </em> shaky and his eyes are only <em> slightly </em>watery when he says, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Komori says. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ball flies towards Atsumu who in turn gets ready for a set and yells, \u201cOmi-kun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa runs, jumps with his right arm in the air, and the ball seems to come flying directly into his palm, a snug fit, as he does what Atsumu had started calling his <em> Bendy Wrist Spike. </em></p>\n<p>They win the set.</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns to see Atsumu high fiving the others, Kageyama Tobio, Hoshiumi Kourai, even Komori, before turning to him.</p>\n<p>Atsumu lowers his hands, settling them on his hips as he tilts his head at him. \u201cLook at you, bein\u2019 all cocky for gettin\u2019 that winning spike.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s eyes narrow at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmmmm,\u201d Atsumu hums, walking to his side, gently nudging him with his elbow, \u201cY\u2019know, Coach said a while ago that we work best together. I heard \u2018im.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Sakusa asks, not exactly surprised.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Best setter. Best ace. Of course, they work well together. They wouldn\u2019t be the best if they couldn\u2019t work well together.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ya think, Omi?\u201d Atsumu presses, \u201cYa think we\u2019re good together?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Sakusa turns his head to properly look at the boy next to him, they nearly bump noses. Sakusa hadn\u2019t even realized how close Atsumu was standing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s met with Atsumu\u2019s wide eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face looked like it used to have his signature cocky smirk on it before it was replaced with an expression of what Sakusa could only describe to be horny panic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could only fucking <em> hope </em> he didn\u2019t have the exact same expression on his face.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only when his eyes start drifting down to Atsumu\u2019s lips that Sakusa realizes where exactly they are and how many people are standing around them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He coughs awkwardly and with much difficulty, manages to look away.</p>\n<p>Atsumu is still staring at him.</p>\n<p>He takes a step away and heads for the benches, bending down to reach his water bottle. \u201cStop staring at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019like it when I stare at ya?\u201d Atsumu teases, stubbornly skipping towards him, plopping himself down on the bench, tilting his head to look Sakusa in the eye again.</p>\n<p>Sakusa merely turns away, turning his attention to his suddenly very interesting gym bag. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to stop because I <em> don\u2019t </em>like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu remains unfazed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d He says, leaning back on his arms, \u201cYer askin\u2019 me to stop \u2018cause ya like it a little <em> too </em>much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of yourself.\u201d Sakusa glares.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know the way people stare at me when they want me,\u201d Atsumu retorts, leaning forward again before Sakusa can begin to look away, \u201cAnd you stare at me an awful lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s grip around his face towel tightens. \u201cHow would you know that? Pay attention to me that much?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t even flinch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I stare at ya an awful lot too,\u201d He says, leaning even closer as if he were about to kiss him, before swerving to speak directly into his ear, <em> \u201cOmi-kun.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>He walks away after that, casually, as if he hadn\u2019t just sent Sakusa\u2019s world spinning out of control. He hears him call for Hoshiumi to practice some quicks.</p>\n<p>Sakusa can only let himself sink into the bench, supporting himself with one hand, feeling his knees shake slightly. Jesus.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Jesus. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He starts looking around in a panic, wondering if anyone fucking saw that, because he knew that if they did see it, they would know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They would <em> know.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa wonders if anyone could have seen that and not put two and two together.</p>\n<p>He scans the room and searches for an expression that would hint that the world suddenly knew that he was gay. He doesn\u2019t find anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries to steady his breathing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody knows. They didn\u2019t see. They couldn\u2019t tell. It\u2019s okay. He\u2019s okay. Only Komori knows. And Atsumu.</p>\n<p>Atsumu.</p>\n<p><em> Fuck, </em>Atsumu. If he didn\u2019t know then, he knew now, didn\u2019t he? Fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels himself starting to spiral. He\u2019s spiraling. He can\u2019t spiral. They have a few hours left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. In and out. In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room is completely dark save for a sliver of moonlight that made its way in through the curtains and the small but bright light coming from Atsumu\u2019s phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa breathes deeply, staring at the cracks in the ceiling, going back and forth between going to bed or\u2026 saying something.</p>\n<p>The wood of their shared bunk bed creaks as Atsumu changes positions, heaving out a tired sigh as the light from the bottom bunk disappears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s now or never.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa takes a deep breath. \u201cMiya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t answer right away. There\u2019s a silence that lasts a few seconds longer than Sakusa deemed comfortable, until Atsumu clears his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Omi? Havin\u2019 trouble sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to ask you something.\u201d Sakusa says, controlling the shake in his voice, trying not to reveal the fact that he\u2019s nervous for a reason he can\u2019t even pinpoint. \u201cYou can choose not to answer if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu hums. \u201cYer bein\u2019 weirdly polite\u2026 how ominous.\u201d Sakusa hears the wood creak again as Atsumu probably sits up. \u201cAlright. What\u2019s yer question?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa licks his lips, closes his eyes, and thinks, <em> fuck it.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa knows that if it were him being asked that same question, he\u2019d probably spiral. He\u2019d probably throw up. There would probably be a Sakusa Kiyoomi shaped hole in the door right about now. He expects a reaction of that dramatic degree as he waits for Atsumu to answer.</p>\n<p>Instead, he hears a faint chuckle.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally thought ya woulda realized it by now.\u201d Atsumu answers, \u201cYeah, I am. But I\u2019m not exactly gay, I\u2019m bisexual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sakusa manages to let out, \u201cThat was\u2026 easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu properly laughs this time. \u201cWhat, ya thought you\u2019d hafta wrestle the answer outta me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Sakusa says, honestly. \u201cPeople talk a lot, you know. About you and your brother. I just assumed people talked \u2018cause they\u2019d never gotten a direct answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, Omi,\u201d Atsumu muses, \u201cYer the very first one who\u2019s had the guts to just ask me. If any one of \u2018em did, I woulda answered \u2018em the exact same way I did just now. I ain\u2019t ashamed of who I am and I don\u2019t make a big deal out of it. Neither does Samu. Everyone else is makin\u2019 a mountain out of a molehill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu. The first openly gay kid that Sakusa Kiyoomi ever meets. <em> Confident </em>and openly gay, at that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still didn\u2019t like him. He still thought he was a cocky bastard. He still hated his guts. But now, he guesses he admired those guts too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anything, he was at least proof that maybe one day, Sakusa could be in a place in his life where he could be the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Confident. Completely himself, unapologetically. <em> Out </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d Sakusa asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so this is storytime now, huh?\u201d Atsumu shoots back, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust fucking answer me.\u201d He huffs, pulling his blankets up higher, tucking them under his chin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 watched porn with Samu when I was eight.\u201d Atsumu answers, a laugh in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s how I fuckin\u2019 knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa can\u2019t help the laugh he lets out at that, too. \u201cThat\u2019s anti-climactic. I was hoping for a more dramatic story than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to disappoint ya, Omi-kun.\u201d Atsumu sighs, sounding nostalgic. \u201cBut that\u2019s really where it started for me, ya know? After that\u2026 figurin\u2019 myself out came easier. I always liked lookin\u2019 at both. Guys a little more than girls, but I knew it was both. Ya get me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet after that and Sakusa starts to feel tense. He clutches onto his sheets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s usually around this time that the other would get curious and start asking questions back, right? Something like, <em> hey, why are you asking? Hey, is there a reason you\u2019re asking for my life story past midnight? Hey\u2026 are you gay too? </em></p>\n<p>Atsumu almost does. He almost asks. But he remembers what it was like to be ten years old, knowing the way he felt, but still being a little too scared to say it out loud, not knowing what words he was supposed to use. He remembers what it was like to stare at a boy in his class, thinking he was the prettiest thing he\u2019d ever seen, and deciding not to tell him. He remembers a girl in his class who liked him and who he liked back, but nothing had ever happened because rumors spread that he liked boys too and that ruined everything.</p>\n<p>He remembers what it was like to be scared. He remembers what it was like when he didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud himself. Hearing other people say it for him made it worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, he doesn\u2019t ask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he shares what he thinks his little self would\u2019ve wanted to hear. He gives Sakusa Kiyoomi something that he never really got for himself back then.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d He starts, \u201cWanna hear \u2018bout when Samu and I came out to our parents and it turned out they knew all along and even bet on when we\u2019d just go ahead and tell \u2018em? Dad got a new fuckin\u2019 office chair out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa lets out what Atsumu assumes is a breath of relief. And then, after a moment, he chuckles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me.\u201d He says, his voice almost a whisper, \u201cTell me whatever the hell you want, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Atsumu just keeps talking. About his parents, about his first few crushes, about the funniest coming out stories he could think of, about meeting other people who were just like them, about Osamu and Suna\u2019s awkward first kiss and how he\u2019d walked in on them in the middle of it and said, <em> \u201cNiiiiiiiice </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The last thing Sakusa hears before he drifts off to sleep is Atsumu going off about how guys should be able to wear lip gloss without being given shit for it. The last thing he feels is gratitude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa worked hard today.\u201d Atsumu comments as they drag their tired bodies into their room on the third night, slamming the door close behind them. \u201cYer body still gonna make it another two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt fucking better.\u201d Sakusa grumbles, pulling his mask down and setting his bag on the floor. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll <em> make </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu snorts. \u201cYer kinda terrifying, Omi-Omi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that as if everybody else doesn\u2019t call you the same thing.\u201d Sakusa retorts, taking hold of the bottom of his jersey and pulling it over his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu turns away in a panic, pointedly staring at the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go for the hot bath before everyone else contaminates it with their germs.\u201d Sakusa says, throwing a towel over his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yeah. Sure.\u201d Atsumu manages to choke out.</p>\n<p>He makes sure to wait for the door to open and then close, before he shuts his eyes and lets out the breath he\u2019s been holding in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sinks down to his bed, burying his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still in that same position by the time Sakusa returns and regards him with a confused look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you, Miya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything.\u201d He answers, before reaching for his bath essentials, and heading out the door without even sparing the boy clad in nothing but a towel a glance, lest he embarrass himself by setting some sort of world record for getting hard in the shortest amount of time. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Atsumu sits in the bath that\u2019s so hot he thinks he\u2019s gonna come out of it cooked, he thinks again, <em> was there even the slightest possibility that Sakusa Kiyoomi could be gay?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Because while his gaydar was pinging at a steady 70% now, maybe even more, when it came down to it, it\u2019s really still a 0% unless confirmed by the person in question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He groans again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will Atsumu survive this? Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>He steels himself as he steps out of the bath, mentally preparing himself to return to his shared room with a... volleyball playing Greek God.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s met with the view of said Greek God in his pajamas, sitting on the bottom bunk, <em> his </em>bunk, rubbing at his wrists. Sakusa looks up at him, eyes widening at the sight of his wet upper half, and then whips his head back down, ears turning red.</p>\n<p>(80%?)</p>\n<p>He\u2019s flustered. Atsumu takes some pride in that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He puts on a little of a show when he pushes his hair back, before bending down to reach for his shirt and boxers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYer wrists alright?\u201d He asks, noticing the way the boy was still pressing on them gently.</p>\n<p>Sakusa hums, still pointedly ignoring the view. \u201cThey get sore easily. I\u2019ve been working them too hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once Atsumu is decent, Sakusa raises his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa ain\u2019t injured, are ya?\u201d Atsumu asks, slightly concerned. \u201cCan\u2019t have that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa shakes his head. \u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu ruffles his hair one last time before making his way to Sakusa, casually sitting on his bed like he belonged there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a seat next to him, keeping a reasonable distance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to rub \u2018em for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa pauses in his ministrations. Actually, a more accurate description is that he seems to\u2026 <em>shut down</em> Microsoft Windows style for a whole second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Sakusa starts, one hand clenching into a fist, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s flustered again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu wonders how far he should push this, how far he <em> can </em>push this before it gets too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa sure? I do it for Samu all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s mind runs on overdrive with only two thoughts going back and forth, fighting against each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, <em> holy shit. </em> Second, <em> you can\u2019t. </em></p>\n<p>But then a third voice pops up in his head, a familiar one, sounding suspiciously like his cousin, saying, <em> let yourself feel it. </em></p>\n<p>Let himself feel it, huh.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sakusa says, slightly moving one of his arms towards Atsumu. \u201cJust for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu beams.</p>\n<p>The second he puts his hands on him, there\u2019s static.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, really.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s static.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 ow.\u201d Atsumu hisses, tearing his hands away for a moment. \u201cSee that, Omi? Maybe coach was right about us bein\u2019 good together. We got a spark, see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really gonna kill you one of these days.\u201d Sakusa deadpans. \u201cGet on with it before I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s smile is both arrogant but also fond when he reaches for Sakusa\u2019s wrist again. How that\u2019s even possible, he doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu presses fingers against his palm, his wrist, a little up his arm, and then down again. Sakusa finds himself leaning against the wall, allowing his eyes to close for a little while.</p>\n<p>He hears Atsumu chuckle softly. \u201cYer likin\u2019 this, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep talking and the moment\u2019s over, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lips are sealed, good sir.\u201d Atsumu says playfully, continuing his massage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa can\u2019t really help it when he breathes out a sated sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks about the night before. He thinks about how easy it\u2019d be for Atsumu to tell people about him, how easy it\u2019d be for him to start gossip the way everyone else had about Atsumu, how easy it\u2019d be to start rumors about Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s sexuality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks about how he knows he wouldn\u2019t. He thinks about how Atsumu, for some reason, knew what not to ask, what Sakusa needed to hear in that moment. He thinks about falling asleep to the sound of the same Kansai dialect that used to star in his jerk off fantasies last year. He thinks about gratitude. He thinks about the fact that he\u2019s sitting next to a boy who he barely knows but at the same time, understands deeply.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s just how it is for people like them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s when Atsumu reaches for his other wrist that Sakusa decides to say something.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor last night,\u201d He starts, making Atsumu pause, \u201cI wanted to say thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes remain closed but for some reason, he can hear Atsumu\u2019s smile. He doesn\u2019t know what to make of that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa startin\u2019 to like me, Omi-Omi?\u201d He teases.</p>\n<p>Sakusa hesitates, wonders if he should play along with Atsumu\u2019s annoying flirtatiousness, but decides against it. He thinks, <em> let yourself feel it. </em> He thinks, <em> just this once. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cStill can\u2019t fucking stand you, actually.\u201d He gripes, which earns him a laugh, \u201cBut\u2026 you\u2019re alright, I guess. Sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hands stop moving completely and there\u2019s a meaningful silence that surrounds their room and Sakusa thinks, <em> now I\u2019ve done it. </em></p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, Atsumu is looking at him with an expression he doesn\u2019t recognize. He looks at him like no one\u2019s ever looked at him before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sakusa thinks to himself, what would it take, how much does he have to give, for Atsumu to keep looking at him like that for the rest of his life?</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize that Atsumu had been moving in closer until he feels his breath against his lips. Sakusa doesn\u2019t realize he has a hand on Atsumu\u2019s thigh until he subconsciously squeezes it and he tenses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares into brown eyes and brown eyes stare back at him, so clear, rid of that faux arrogance he always had in them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, Sakusa sees something that almost resembled\u2026 fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s that look in his eyes that snaps Sakusa back to reality. It\u2019s his own heartbeat in his ears that takes him back to sitting in the living room, looking at the headshot of an 18 year old boy whose life was taken by his sexuality. It\u2019s the ghost of a touch against his lips that takes him all those years back, sitting in a classroom, <em> gay people go to hell. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He gasps, instantly pulling away, as if he\u2019d been burnt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stumbles out of the bed, eyes wide and panicked, the back of his hand pressed against his mouth. \u201cFuck, I\u2026 <em> shit </em>, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Omi, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Atsumu starts, looking just as disoriented, refusing to meet Sakusa\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 m\u2019sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, no, that wasn\u2019t,\u201d Sakusa stutters, running a hand through his hair, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2026 I mean, <em> I\u2019m </em> not like tha-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Atsumu says, cutting him off. And he has another expression on his face that Sakusa\u2019s never seen on him before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shame.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, they find themselves lying in their respective beds with all the lights shut off. All that\u2019s left is the sliver of moonlight that makes its way past the curtains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet as Sakusa pretends to be in deep sleep, as if his heart wasn\u2019t still trying to beat its way out of his chest. And it\u2019s a few moments later that he hears a sad voice coming from the bunk below him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Omi?\u201d Atsumu calls out, and without waiting for a response, continues. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about a while ago. I got\u2026 carried away, y\u2019know? M\u2019sorry I pushed you to do somethin\u2019 ya didn\u2019t want\u2026\u201d He pauses, \u201c... or weren\u2019t ready for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa squeezes his eyes shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>He learns that very night, that when you want something so <em> badly </em> that it scares the shit out of you, it tends to translate as dislike to other people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get any sleep that night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pretends, though. He wonders if Atsumu was pretending too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day is tense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s tense and it\u2019s weird and it\u2019s so awkward that it\u2019s almost painful. It would\u2019ve been easier to get through if the terrible mood only stayed between the two of them, but as if they couldn\u2019t help it, it had spread to everyone else in their immediate surroundings.</p>\n<p>Atsumu has resorted to speaking to him only when it\u2019s volleyball related. Otherwise, he spends most of the day sticking close to Kageyama, who just looked confused about the whole thing. At one point, Sakusa thinks he hears the two talking about being a <em> \u2018goody two-shoes\u2019 </em>whatever that meant. He didn\u2019t even wanna know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day stretches on like that. Uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Kageyama cringes at a missed spike by Sakusa that was set by Atsumu, Hoshiumi gives Atsumu shit for being so off when he\u2019d been doing fucking perfectly the past few days, and Komori starts giving them concerned looks.</p>\n<p>Sakusa waves his cousin off, mouthing, <em> none of your damn business.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>But then, a thought crosses his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was it written all over his face? Did they <em> all </em> know? Can they tell what happened last night?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s that thought that leads him into a bathroom stall, after leaving with nothing but a hurried <em> \u2018just a minute\u2019 </em>directed towards their coach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels himself spiraling. The walls start closing in, his chest gets tighter, his hands go numb, and he clenches and unclenches them, struggling to get the feeling back.</p>\n<p>He focuses on his breathing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019s going to be<em> fine. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After he manages to gather himself and walk out of the bathroom, the first sight he\u2019s greeted with is Atsumu sitting on the ground with his legs spread completely open, as Hoshiumi dug a knee into his back pushing him forward, helping him stretch.</p>\n<p>Atsumu winces, groaning a little. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s good\u2026 can you do it a little harder-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa walks right back into the bathroom. He wants to fucking die.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s night had already been planned out since he woke up in the morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After practice was over, he\u2019d eat dinner, take a shower, jerk off, do his skincare routine, and then he\u2019d vent to his twin.</p>\n<p>He stares at the closed door. Sakusa normally took much longer than him both when it came to eating and soaking in the bath, and he just assumed he\u2019s gonna take even longer this time to avoid him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He adjusts the towel around his waist and picks up his phone.</p>\n<p>It rings twice before Osamu answers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEw.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 ew me, ya scrub.\u201d Atsumu hisses. \u201cI\u2019m losin\u2019 my fuckin\u2019 mind here and ya ain\u2019t even here to suffer with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this just you bein\u2019 yer dramatic self or are ya actually sufferin\u2019 out there?\u201d Osamu asks, mouth full of what Atsumu assumes to be onigiri.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre ya eatin\u2019 onigiri?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu pauses. \u201cHow the fuck did ya know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno if it\u2019s a twin thing or if yer just that predictable.\u201d Atsumu shrugs, even knowing Osamu won\u2019t see him. \u201cBut I <em> am </em>sufferin\u2019. I fuckin\u2019 hate yer ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Osamu says tiredly, taking another bite, \u201cDid ya have anything else to tell me or are ya just gonna be annoying the whole time? \u2018Cause I\u2019ll hang up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu pauses. \u201cSamu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs, resting his head against the wall, \u201cYa shoulda been here. They woulda let us room together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Osamu snorts, \u201cIt\u2019s about yer roomie. What happened with you and yer\u2026 Omi-kun, was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe almost kissed last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu hears what sounds like a spit take. \u201cThe fu- you almost <em> what?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cKissed, god damn it!\u201d Atsumu repeats, \u201cI dunno, one second I was massagin\u2019 his freakishly bendy wrists and the next we were \u2018boutta\u2026 do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu, fer the love o\u2019 I don\u2019t even know, don\u2019t tell me ya just sprung one on him.\u201d Osamu says in a hurry, \u201cYa gotta make sure they want it too if yer gonna put yer mouth on \u2018em.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Kissing Expert, just \u2018cause shit worked out with you and yer dumb boyfriend.\u201d Atsumu huffs. \u201cI <em> did, </em>I mean, I\u2026 I thought\u2026 look, he was the one who said it was alright if I rubbed his wrists, alright? And when I leaned in, he fuckin\u2019 put his hand on my thigh and did the same, what was I s\u2019posed to think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Osamu clarifies, \u201cso <em> that </em>happened and ya almost kissed\u2026 why almost? Did ya get interrupted or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr somethin\u2019.\u201d Atsumu says, walking across the room to flop down on his bed, stretching his legs out. \u201cHe suddenly freaked out on me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s\u2026 I dunno, I mean, I <em> thought </em>he was gay, I kinda felt it and y\u2019know how accurate my gaydar is, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu hums, thinking. \u201cWas he <em> not?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, Samu.\u201d Atsumu groans. \u201cI dunno. Maybe he isn\u2019t or maybe he\u2019s just still goin\u2019 through it, y\u2019know? Figurin\u2019 shit out. I mean, we\u2019ve all been there.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet on the other end for a few seconds. Atsumu doesn\u2019t really care. Sometimes, just having his twin on the other line was comforting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYa feelin\u2019 alright?\u201d Osamu asks, carefully. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a dick about it, was he? Need me to go over there \u2018n punch him for ya?\u201d</p>\n<p>He loved Osamu, sometimes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt killed me a little inside, but it wasn\u2019t really his fault, y\u2019know?\u201d Atsumu says, \u201cYa don\u2019t needa punch no one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf ya say so, Tsumu.\u201d Osamu seems to think about it for a little before continuing with, \u201cDon\u2019t beat yerself up over it, alright? I don\u2019t think ya did anything wrong\u2026 maybe talk to him about it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu merely hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd be careful, hear me? Don\u2019t hurt yerself.\u201d He says, \u201c... or him, if he\u2019s still, y\u2019know, figurin\u2019 his shit out. It\u2019s not a great place to be, not knowin\u2019 yerself. That takes some time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cTsumu.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 got it.\u201d Atsumu grumbles, \u201cDon\u2019t start naggin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears his brother sigh on the other end of the line. \u201cD\u2019ya like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I fuckin\u2019 tried to kiss him, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Atsumu retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, ya dipshit, I mean do you fuckin\u2019 <em>like </em>him? I mean, beyond wantin' to make out or touch his dick, d\u2019ya wanna hold his hand, feed him fuckin\u2019 soup, and go on shitty dates with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa mean do I wanna be gross with him like you and Sunarin?\u201d Atsumu clarifies, bitterly. \u201cWe don\u2019t all get to end up bein\u2019 cute with our crushes at the end, Samu. Sunarin\u2019s been smitten with you since freshman year and Omi fuckin\u2019 hates my guts half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much we can do about that \u2018cause everyone hates yer guts.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cSaaaaaamuuuuuu,\u201d </em> Atsumu whines, \u201cCan\u2019t ya just tell me, <em> hey, yer the best, someone\u2019ll come around and love ya, </em> like you know I need to hear right now?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet yer shit together.\u201d Osamu says with a tone of finality. \u201cAnd put some fuckin\u2019 clothes on before calling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks down at himself. \u201cHow the fuck did ya know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwin thing?\u201d He answers, \u201cOr maybe yer just that predictable. G\u2019night, dipshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Samu but what do I do about my stupid fuckin\u2019 crush on Omi-\u201d</p>\n<p>At that moment, three things happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing, Osamu hangs up before he can finish his sentence, the god damn waste of sperm.</p>\n<p>The second thing is that he stands up, drops his phone, and his towel unwraps so he has to keep it up with one hand to cover at least his front half.</p>\n<p>The third thing is that just as he says <em> \u2018stupid fuckin\u2019 crush on Omi\u2019 </em>the door opens and in comes the subject in question, similar to him, clad in nothing but a towel.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a momentous silence that follows as the product of those three things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then it is cut off by Sakusa clenching his fists, closing his eyes, taking a deep breath, and walking big, angry steps forward, until he\u2019s standing right in front of Atsumu.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s grip on his towel <em> hurts.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He stares at Sakusa who\u2019s looking at him with the most intense grimace he\u2019s ever seen in his life, as if he was in actual pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu can relate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Sakusa says, voice so low it\u2019s a whisper. He\u2019s shaking. \u201cI <em> can\u2019t.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Big mood. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sucks in a shocked breath. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s ever called him by his actual name.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Atsumu breathes out, \u201cWhat is it, Omi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>(100%.)</p>\n<p>This time, it\u2019s Sakusa who closes the distance. There\u2019s nothing romantic about it. It isn\u2019t gentle or slow. He grabs Atsumu by the back of his neck with one hand, uses the other to grip his waist, and presses their lips together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so sudden that Atsumu almost yells and there\u2019s too much teeth and it hurts and his lips might be bleeding a bit, but <em> god, holy shit. </em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s rough and unpracticed and Atsumu can tell Sakusa hasn't had much practice before, so he raises his free hand to caress the side of his face, making him relax, ease out, until they\u2019re just\u2026 <em> kissing.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t help the smile that makes its way to his lips.</p>\n<p>When he opens his mouth a little wider, Sakusa follows his lead, and Atsumu pokes his tongue out a little to see how the other would respond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s rewarded with a soft moan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s one hand is still holding onto his towel and he has two options.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One, stop kissing this beautiful boy and tell him he has to fix his towel or else he\u2019ll be standing buck naked. Or two, just\u2026 <em> drop it.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>But then, dropping it would mean being naked and revealing his rock hard dick and he doesn\u2019t know how far they were gonna take this, even if they\u2019re literally almost completely naked. I mean, he kinda <em> wants </em>to but what if Sakusa didn\u2019t-</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu.\u201d Sakusa says a little angrily against his lips, \u201cI\u2019m literally leaving all my fucking thoughts out the door right now. <em> All </em> of them. You better not be stuck in your head right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Atsumu says, pressing against him, running his hand through Sakusa\u2019s hair, \u201cRight. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa rests his hand on the small of Atsumu\u2019s back, steps forward, leads them closer to the bed, until Atsumu\u2019s head bumps into the top bunk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa pulls away a little and Atsumu stares at the spit string between them and then at the boy in front of him and <em> fuck, </em> he looks <em> wrecked. </em>His hair\u2019s a wet mess, his cheeks are beet red, his eyes are hooded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He watches Sakusa\u2019s gaze go from his face, to his neck, to his chest, and then\u2026</p>\n<p>He feels Sakusa\u2019s hands travel down to the sides of his hips and he squeezes. Atsumu reflexively bucks forward, and bites back a groan.</p>\n<p>They both stare down at each other\u2019s towels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s running solely on his last shred of self control. He takes a deep, calming breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi.\u201d He says, trying to contain the desperation in his voice. \u201cI only want this if you want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa only fights with himself for a second. Somehow, the ugly voices that always pop up in his head during moments like these, are drowned out completely by the sound of their heavy breathing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With all the courage and horniness of a sixteen year old boy, Sakusa puts his hand over Atsumu\u2019s clenched fist that held onto his towel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu, I\u2019ll be really fucking honest with you right now,\u201d Sakusa starts, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted anything so badly in my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>And there goes Atsumu\u2019s last shred of self-control. Out the window. Out of town. Taking a damn flight to Mexico.</p>\n<p>He tosses his towel to the side, using his now free hand to run through Sakusa\u2019s blessed curls, before clenching them in his fist, gripping onto his hair, and pulling.</p>\n<p>The sound Sakusa makes almost makes him come right then and there.</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus <em> fuck, </em> Omi,\u201d Atsumu whines, ducking his head to press his lips against his neck, thrusting his hips forward, making it rub against Sakusa\u2019s towel, \u201cTouch me, <em> god, </em>please, please, put your hand on my dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sakusa breathes out, tilting his head to give Atsumu more access, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting to that, just\u2026 keep doing that with your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d Atsumu says, biting into his skin lightly while also making sure not to leave marks, \u201cGet that towel off you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d Sakusa says, hands reaching down to grasp at Atsumu\u2019s ass cheeks. He squeezes them and Atsumu\u2019s knees nearly fucking buckle. He lets out a soft <em> fuck, omi, </em>\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 done this before. Never touched anyone\u2019s dick\u2026 apart from my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, same,\u201d Atsumu manages to answer, already slightly delirious, \u201cCan we sit the fuck down? I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m losin\u2019 it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu pulls them both down into the bottom bunk, ripping Sakusa\u2019s towel off him in the process and it\u2019s the first time they both actually get a good look at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMotherfucker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re big.\u201d They say in complete unison.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s eyes lock onto his cock making Atsumu squirm at the attention, but he pushes the embarrassment down and smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I was onto somethin\u2019 when I said we should get the feel of both, huh?\u201d He asks against Sakusa\u2019s mouth, \u201cUsin\u2019 just one of these would be wastin\u2019 resources, Omi, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa manages a laugh. \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re so full of\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, hopefully, in a few minutes.\u201d Atsumu retorts, pressing their lips together again, successfully shutting Sakusa up.</p>\n<p>They navigate their way to a horizontal position, Sakusa looming over him and pressing their crotches together. He grinds forward and they groan in unison.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre these walls soundproof?\u201d Sakusa asks hurriedly, suddenly worried about how much noise they were making.</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno.\u201d Atsumu answers, pushing Sakusa\u2019s head down to his neck, \u201cI\u2019ll be quiet, I promise, just\u2026 touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Well, first we\u2014 <em> shit.\u201d </em>Sakusa swears heartily, pressing his forehead against Atsumu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShit, we can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Atsumu squeaks, his dick twitching. \u201cBut.. I mean, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t wanna, I\u2019ll.. I can take another shower\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you idiot.\u201d Sakusa grunts. \u201cDo you have any condoms and lube in your luggage \u2018cause I sure don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cShit.\u201d </em>Atsumu swears, throwing his head back onto his pillow. \u201cOkay, so.. so we can\u2019t have sex. No anal penetration. Whatever. Fine. But, we can do other stuff\u2026 right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa raises his eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you proposing?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAnything.\u201d </em> Atsumu whines, jerking his hips forward suggestively, earning a hiss from Sakusa. \u201cFuck, <em> anything </em> , I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 dying here. Yer still hard, aren\u2019t ya? How do you wanna come? With my hand? My <em> mouth?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cFuck.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s swearing a lot tonight. He thinks he\u2019s going to have the imaginary image of Atsumu\u2019s mouth around his dick stored in his memory to bring out for future jerk-off sessions but tonight, because he has no experience, because he doesn\u2019t wanna be one-upped by him, he reaches for Atsumu\u2019s hand and pushes it between them, \u201cStroke me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Atsumu says, cheeky even with a hand wrapped around Sakusa\u2019s dick. \u201cTouch me, please. Touch me <em> now.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa rolls off of him, choosing to lay next to him. They adjust their positions, lying on their sides, facing each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa breathes heavily as Atsumu\u2019s hand picks up its pace as he reaches down to wrap his own around Atsumu\u2019s.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cFuck yes,\u201d </em> Atsumu gasps, involuntarily jerking forward, <em> \u201cKiyoomi.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Oh, hell. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hand around his cock is tight and fast, exactly the way he likes it, and he doesn\u2019t know why the fuck Atsumu seems to know that. He knows very well that if he doesn\u2019t let up with this speed, he\u2019s not gonna last very long.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time anyone other than himself was touching his dick. Sue him.</p>\n<p>He chokes on a moan, squeezing his eyes shut, as Atsumu presses their foreheads together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look so fuckin\u2019 good, holy shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa almost wants to hit him for that but he opens his eyes and is met with what will probably be a visual that will stay in his core memory forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s looking at him with an insatiable hunger, he\u2019s sweating, mouth half open and drooling right onto the pillow, puffing hot breaths against Sakusa\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,<em> god, </em> ease up,\u201d He groans, \u201cIf you keep going, I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Sakusa knows his own hand is getting sloppy but Atsumu doesn\u2019t seem to care as long as he\u2019s getting touched.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Atsumu breathes out, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just let me.

And then,</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still really fuckin\u2019 hard.\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cCan you sit up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa blinks his eyes open and stares down at Atsumu\u2019s leaking dick.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Right. Shit. </em>If he didn\u2019t just have the best orgasm of his life, he\u2019d be fully hard again just looking at it.</p>\n<p>He hesitantly sits up, groaning as he does, his entire body feeling like jelly. \u201cHow do you wanna do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen yer legs a little.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh. </em>Sakusa likes where this is going. He opens his legs slightly, giving enough space for Atsumu to crawl between them. He sighs contentedly as the boy leans against him, the warmth of his back pressed against his chest, his head resting on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you fold yer legs a bit? Get yer knees up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa does what he\u2019s told, pressing the bottom of his feet on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice.\u201d Atsumu says, raising both his legs and opening them as wide as the space allowed, using Sakusa\u2019s legs to hold them in place, the back of his thighs pressed against Sakusa\u2019s knees.</p>\n<p>He reaches for Sakusa\u2019s hand which had unknowingly made its way to Atsumu\u2019s stomach and pulls it towards his cock. He looks up at him with hooded eyes and whispers, \u201cMake me feel good, Omi.\u201d</p>\n<p>This looked like something out of Sakusa\u2019s dirtiest fantasies. He lets out an unstable breath and nips at Atsumu\u2019s earlobe as he starts stroking.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes roll back, his head lolling to the side.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Tighter.\u201d </em>He gasps, after a few seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d Sakusa says in a low, playful voice, thinking, <em> he\u2019s rubbing off on me now, huh. </em></p>\n<p>Atsumu moans, one hand coming up to hold onto the back of Sakusa\u2019s neck. <em> \u201cFaster.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa does what he\u2019s asked and is rewarded with a high pitched keen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Omi,\u201d Atsumu pants, head thrown back against his shoulder. \u201cD\u2019ya mind if I finger myself while you jerk me off? I\u2019ve been.. <em> shit, </em> close for a while now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s breath catches in his throat. \u201cFuck. Has anyone ever said no to that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu probably would\u2019ve laughed at that if he wasn\u2019t about to explode. \u201cOkay. Ease up a little for now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hurriedly sticks two shaky fingers in his mouth, licking, sucking and making a show of it, pointedly looking at Sakusa with half-lidded eyes.</p>\n<p>Sakusa groans, pressing his forehead against Atsumu. \u201cDear fucking <em> God </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu reaches down once his two digits are thoroughly soaked in spit, slowly sticking them in at the same time, and groans loudly.</p>\n<p>Sakusa can\u2019t help but wince. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head. \u201cI did it in the shower a while ago for a bit. Hurry and stroke my fuckin\u2019 dick.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, Sakusa is saving <em> that </em>image for later.</p>\n<p>He strokes Atsumu\u2019s cock in earnest, tight and fast, as he watches him fuck himself onto his fingers. The noises that spill out of his mouth are downright sinful.</p>\n<p>Sakusa marvels at the sight and the feeling, Atsumu\u2019s sweaty thighs wide open and pressed against his own, his hard leaking cock in his hand, his body nearly folded in half as he pumped his fingers in and out of himself.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s head is thrown back in bliss, drool dribbling down the side of his mouth, eyebrows pinched.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d Atsumu says urgently, his grip on the back of Sakusa\u2019s neck suddenly going up to his hair and pulling <em> hard, </em> \u201cOmi, fer the love o\u2019 <em> god, faster </em>, I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 close\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>He starts fucking himself harder, face contorting into an expression that one can only really make when they\u2019re about to come. Sakusa watches in wonder as he picks up the pace of his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> god,\u201d </em> Atsumu cries, back arching, hand in Sakusa\u2019s hair going impossibly tight, \u201c <em> Fuck, baby, </em> you\u2019re gonna make me come so fucking <em> hard\u2014\u201c </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> (Baby.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>The noise that leaves his mouth does not sound human. It\u2019s like a mix of a high pitched moan and a strangled yell and if Sakusa were in his right fucking mind, he\u2019d be worrying about whether the neighboring rooms could hear them because if they could, it sounded like someone was getting murdered.</p>\n<p>But all he can focus on is the way Atsumu looks as ropes of come shoot out of him, painting his hand, his torso, his neck, as Atsumu writhed, toes curling in the air, moaned variations of <em> fuck </em> \u2019s and <em> Omi, god, shit, don\u2019t stop, </em>tumbling out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>It feels like a lifetime before Atsumu comes down from his high, his body sinking back against his own, dick going completely soft in Sakusa\u2019s fist, and the fingers inside him slowing until they still to a complete stop.</p>\n<p>It feels like both seconds and hours before Atsumu finally opens his eyes, breathes out a weak laugh and says, \u201cHoly shit. I\u2019ve never come so hard in my life. Yer wrists sure come in handy for stuff like that, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa will say later on that he couldn\u2019t help himself, that anyone who would\u2019ve seen him at that moment wouldn\u2019t be able to help themselves, when he tilts Atsumu\u2019s face up, and presses their lips together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a gentle kiss, nothing but a peck, but out of everything they\u2019d done that night, that leaves them the most breathless.</p>\n<p>Atsumu stares at him as he pulls away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raises a hand, caresses Sakusa\u2019s cheek, watches in awe as he leans into his touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Atsumu says, voice a little hoarse from usage, \u201cIs it alright if I ask you to sleep next to me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa swallows. He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s clean up first, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>As they lay in bed that night, Sakusa\u2019s arm thrown over Atsumu\u2019s waist, the boy\u2019s face buried in his neck, a question lingers in the air.</p>\n<p>Atsumu slithers an arm around Sakusa, pulling him closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYer a different you tonight.\u201d He whispers. \u201cAre you gonna disappear in the morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s hold on him tightens, but he doesn\u2019t answer.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s voice sounds sad as he closes his eyes, says, \u201cG\u2019night and goodbye, my Omi-Omi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>When Atsumu wakes up in the morning to an empty bed and a lack of duffel bags, he isn\u2019t surprised. When the last thing he sees of Sakusa Kiyoomi is the back of his head as he walks out the glass doors, he isn\u2019t surprised, either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does the only thing he\u2019s ever done at times like these. Once he\u2019s safely sitting on a bench in the station, he calls Osamu.</p>\n<p>He picks up after the first ring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p>\n<p>A long silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu? Ya there?\u201d</p>\n<p>A sniff.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d Osamu sounds concerned now, \u201cTsumu? Where the fuck are you? Should I pick you up? Are ya hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu,\u201d Atsumu\u2019s voice breaks, \u201cCan ya meet me at the station when I get there? I feel like fuckin\u2019 garbage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Course I can.\u201d Osamu says and doesn\u2019t ask, just assures. Atsumu loves him a lot at the moment. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStay on the phone with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here, ya scrub.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa and Komori are given a warm welcome home by his parents. They ask them about the people, ask them about their skills, ask them about their improvement.</p>\n<p>They tell Sakusa they\u2019re so proud of him. Their friends are so jealous of their only son. They\u2019re sure girls will be fawning all over him. They\u2019re sure a girl better than his ex will come along for him.</p>\n<p>When he enters his bedroom, Komori follows behind him and shuts the door. When he knows he\u2019s safe, in a place where only he and Komori can hear, he buries his face into his pillow and just screams for an immeasurable amount of time.</p>\n<p>He screams for so long that it\u2019s painful, with Komori\u2019s hand gently rubbing his back, until he passes out.</p>\n<p>When he goes back to school, he visits the girls volleyball club during practice and asks their libero out. She says yes and kisses him on the cheek. She introduces him to her team as his boyfriend, holding his hand the whole time. Komori gazes from across the court, looking concerned.</p>\n<p>He goes home and scrubs his cheek so hard it turns red. He washes his hands so hard that they peel. He wears gloves to dinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When his parents ask, he\u2019ll say, <em> it\u2019s just the cold </em> instead of <em> it\u2019s the cost I\u2019m paying to be the good fucking son you want. </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b> <em>T MINUS 1 HOUR AND 43 MINUTES TO THE WEDDING</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The breeze is cold but the sun rays keep them warm.

Scattered throughout the year, they would see each other across courts and venues. They\u2019d pass by each other near food stands or T-shirt stalls. They\u2019d catch glances of each other during warm ups or when they\u2019re standing with the rest of the players who qualified for Nationals during the opening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stolen glances. That\u2019s all they ever allowed themselves to have.</p>\n<p>Sakusa almost expected for the entire world to know what he and Atsumu did that night, thought that maybe he\u2019d go on some rampage, angry and vengeful, and would tell everyone what a dick he was.</p>\n<p>Tell everyone that the #1 ace of high school volleyball was gay and that he\u2019d treated Atsumu like a hit and run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he\u2019d done that, Sakusa probably wouldn\u2019t have survived it. But he probably would\u2019ve deserved it. He wouldn\u2019t have held it against him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t. He never did. Everytime their eyes met, he never even sensed any anger or resentment in Atsumu\u2019s brown eyes. Sakusa knew that he wasn\u2019t angry. Only hurt.</p>\n<p>Sakusa never stopped feeling like shit for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thought, maybe in a different universe, maybe if he had different parents, they could\u2019ve done more. They could\u2019ve done something. Maybe, he and Atsumu could be giving each other good luck kisses or congratulations kisses or you did well no matter what kisses right now.</p>\n<p>Maybe they could\u2019ve been together. Maybe Sakusa wouldn\u2019t have had to spend a whole year making out with another girl he just couldn\u2019t love, no matter how hard he tried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe. That\u2019s all he has. A <em>maybe.</em></p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t slept with anyone since Atsumu happened. Not that his girlfriend never tried to initiate anything, though. He felt like shit about her, too. He\u2019s yet to touch her without his gloves. She didn\u2019t deserve any of this and he\u2019s always known it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He just couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it again. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it with anyone else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wonders if Atsumu has. And then, he feels a sting in his chest when he realizes he probably has.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pushes the thought away.</p>\n<p>When they shake hands before the match starts, Atsumu doesn\u2019t look at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cLet\u2019s play a good game!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu serves first.

There\u2019s a good amount of crying.</p>\n<p>For some of them, it was their last year ever playing.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t even close to being the end of Atsumu\u2019s volleyball career, though it was the end for his brother\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t really gotten over that. There are still days when the fact that his twin is quitting volleyball forever pops up in his head and it usually ends with him having to punch Osamu to get the anger out of his system.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu never says anything about it, at this point. He knows he\u2019s just going through the stages of grief and right now he\u2019s at <em> Anger. </em></p>\n<p>That anger is heightened at the moment, because it\u2019s his last high school volleyball game, he gets second place instead of first, his first real heartbreak\u2019s team wins first, and to top it all off, his goddamn twin is canoodling with his pretty middle blocker boyfriend somewhere, abandoning his own flesh and blood.</p>\n<p>The <em> nerve.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Once he starts dating someone, he\u2019ll make sure to make Osamu third wheel all the time.

We lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were good.\u201d Sakusa says, sounding sincere which made it worse somehow, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean shit, does it, Omi?\u201d Atsumu shoots back, turning the tap off, his hands clutching onto the edge of the sink. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if ya didn\u2019t win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s silent at that. Atsumu\u2019s glad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t wanna hear him encourage him with words that he didn\u2019t actually mean. He and Sakusa didn\u2019t get along about a lot of things. But their thoughts on volleyball was the one thing they could agree on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being good means nothing if it doesn\u2019t get you a win.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep playing, won\u2019t you?\u201d Sakusa asks, but it\u2019s not a question, it\u2019s a statement. \u201cThen, just win next time.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu finally turns, finally looks him in the eye, and it bothers him a little more than he thought it would, the expression on Sakusa\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It looked a whole lot like guilt. It looked a whole fucking lot like pity.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other for a few seconds, as if taking each other in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d ya do it?\u201d Atsumu asks in a voice that\u2019s more of an exhale. \u201cI wanna know at least that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both know what he\u2019s talking about, even without him saying it out loud.</p>\n<p>Sakusa gulps. His mouth feels dry. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bullshit.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Atsumu bites his tongue, his jaw tightening. \u201cWhat the fuck d\u2019ya mean you don\u2019t know? People don\u2019t do shit like that and then fuckin\u2019 <em> run away </em>without knowing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, they do.\u201d Sakusa presses, convincing Atsumu as much as he\u2019s convincing himself, \u201cPeople do shit like that all the time, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels horrified when he realizes there are tears prickling in the back of his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that all it was?\u201d He asks, hoping Sakusa doesn\u2019t hear the slight tremble in his voice, \u201cWas it really? \u2018Cause I don\u2019t think it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLie to me all you want.\u201d Atsumu says, expression turning hard. \u201cBut ya shouldn\u2019t lie to yerself like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa grimaces, turning his gaze to the wall behind Atsumu. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this right now. It\u2019s been a year, Miya. I\u2026 I have a girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu almost laughs at that. He laughs because when he says the word <em> \u2018girlfriend\u2019 </em>he sounds like he\u2019s being held at gunpoint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of fucking things Atsumu wants to say. A shit ton of things. He swallows them all down.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, Omi.\u201d Atsumu says, closing his eyes, and swiping at them with the back of his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you how to live yer damn life.\u201d</p>\n<p>His arm brushes against Sakusa\u2019s as he walks past him. \u201cBut next time, leave me the fuck out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Atsumu can make it past the door, he hears Sakusa speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple for everyone. It\u2019s not\u2026 that easy for everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hand tightens around the door frame. He fights the urge to yell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so ya fuckin\u2019 know,\u201d He says between gritted teeth, \u201cYer the only one I\u2019ve fuckin\u2019 done that shit with. Because know what? It wasn\u2019t just <em> that </em>for me. I don\u2019t do shit like that if it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo yeah,\u201d Atsumu continues, not even trying to hide the anger in his voice anymore, \u201cIt\u2019s not that fuckin\u2019 <em> easy </em>for everyone. Have a good fuckin\u2019 night, Omi. And have the best god damn celebration. Congratulations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s just about ready to tear the entire venue down looking for his brother, when he sees him sitting on a bench in the corner with Suna, protein bars in their hands.</p>\n<p>When he approaches them, he\u2019s angrily wiping his face. He\u2019s glad that people can just assume he\u2019s in this state because of their loss. It was half true, anyway.</p>\n<p>Osamu knew better, though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d He asks, grabbing onto Atsumu\u2019s wrist and sitting him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019re the others? Kita-san? Aran-kun?\u201d He sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith their families.\u201d Osamu says, still looking concerned, \u201cOurs are out buyin\u2019 stupid t-shirts. What the fuck\u2019s wrong with ya, Tsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa look terrible, just so ya know.\u201d Suna adds, leaning down to get a good look at Atsumu\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Atsumu puts his legs up and folds himself into a fetal position, burying his face in his knees like a child throwing a tantrum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw Omi in the bathroom.\u201d He grumbles. \u201cWasn\u2019t a fun conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lovers share a look. Suna instantly sighs and stands up, making his way to sit on Atsumu\u2019s other side. They both lay their hands on his back, patting him and playing with his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All Atsumu needed at times like this was attention. Like a ten year old kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cYa never did tell me what the fuck happened last year.\u201d Osamu points out. \u201cI dunno how to help ya with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu groans. \u201cI <em> can\u2019t, </em>I hate him, but it ain\u2019t just my story to tell. Besides,\u201d He sighs, \u201cYer the one who told me it\u2019s a shit time to still be figurin\u2019 yerself out, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu bites his lip. \u201cWas he a dick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Atsumu sighs. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m mad but I\u2019ll leave \u2018im the fuck alone. I think he might have some issues he hasta work through.\u201d</p>\n<p>Suna and Osamu share a look again and they don\u2019t know what exactly is going on, but somehow, they can make a good guess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu\u2019s gaze lands on a group a few feet away from them, namely the Itachiyama team, with some of their families.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s standing with his parents and Komori.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People talked about the kind of family Sakusa Kiyoomi belonged to. The kind of people his parents are.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t hard to put two and two together. Atsumu probably knew it too. It\u2019s probably the only reason why he hadn\u2019t punched him right in the nose in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know,\u201d Suna starts, rubbing comforting circles on Atsumu\u2019s back, \u201cWhen someone\u2019s raised to believe that who they are is wrong, they really start believin\u2019 in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu hums.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get hung up on this, Tsumu.\u201d Osamu says, throwing an arm around his brother, squeezing lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t get hung up on him. I know yer stubborn as hell, but I think ya need to let this go and let him figure his shit out. I don\u2019t want ya goin\u2019 out there and makin\u2019 shit complicated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu glares at him. \u201c<em> I </em>didn\u2019t make shit complicated for him, he\u2019s the one-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about Sakusa Kiyoomi, Tsumu, I meant fer <em> you.\u201d </em>Osamu clarifies, \u201cIf I have to see ya like this over him again, I\u2019m gonna punch ya in the face, hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu lets out a long breath. He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d His brother says, letting go of him. \u201cFocus on volleyball. How\u2019re ya gonna go pro when yer still so shit at it?\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a punch to the jaw.</p>\n<p>Suna brings out his phone and presses the record button.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>A few feet away from them, Sakusa poses for pictures, holding up his medal with a gloved hand. His parents motion for him and his girlfriend to stand closer together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She stands on her tiptoes and leans towards him, her lips puckering up as if about to kiss him, but only hovering a few centimeters from his cheek. His parents smile fondly.</p>\n<p>Komori looks like he\u2019s the one in pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as they\u2019re changing out of their jerseys that Komori turns to him, asks, \u201cAre you sure about what you\u2019re doing, Sakusa? I\u2019m worried about you, you know. It\u2019s been a year. You look\u2026 miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa clenches his jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori sighs heavily. \u201cDo you actually like her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good person.\u201d He says, shoving his dirty clothes into a plastic bag, \u201cShe\u2019s good for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori zips up his jacket, staring at the back of Sakusa\u2019s head sadly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, after their high school graduation, Sakusa breaks up with her. She cries and asks why. He flounders and ends up going with,</p>\n<p>\u201cI.. uh\u2026\u201d He pauses, shoving his hands in his pocket, \u201c... cheated on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She slaps him and walks away in tears.</p>\n<p>He rubs his cheek that she\u2019d kissed so many times before and feels nothing but numbness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He guesses he didn\u2019t exactly lie. Emotional cheating was a thing, right?</p>\n<p>This time, for some reason, he\u2019s even less upset than the first time he was broken up with. He stands in front of his bathroom mirror, staring at the redness on his cheek, and all he can think about is Atsumu saying, <em> I don\u2019t do shit like that if it doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. </em></p>\n<p>When he tells his parents about his breakup #2, they\u2019re devastated. They liked her a lot. They said she was a good girl. He pretends to be sad and tells them that they just couldn\u2019t work it out, volleyball took up too much of his time, she couldn\u2019t put up with it, and they were getting distant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not sad. He\u2019s tired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so tired. He wants to tell them that he\u2019s dated two girls, kissed them more times than he could count, but couldn\u2019t feel even a millimeter of what he\u2019d felt with Atsumu that night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried. God knows he fucking tried. If there\u2019s anything he did, it\u2019s that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, sweetie,\u201d His mom says, kissing the top of his head, \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a lot of great girls in university. Everyone will have their eyes on my beautiful boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa wonders, <em> if he tells them the truth, will he lose this? Will he lose being their beautiful boy? </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Was he okay with losing that? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>T MINUS 8-4 YEARS BEFORE THE WEDDING</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>University wasn\u2019t all that interesting or life changing for Sakusa Kiyoomi. People always told him back then that college would be where everything changed for you.</p>\n<p>Not much did.</p>\n<p>He was living alone for the first time. So, technically, he had a lot more freedom to do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t party, didn\u2019t make too many friends though he did have a few acquaintances, and spent all his time either studying or training. All he needed to do was get his fucking degree and then he could go pro, like he\u2019s always wanted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His first year went by uneventfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was busy, <em> really </em>busy, which was probably why his parents weren\u2019t on his case about him not dating anyone or making any friends. Although.</p>\n<p>It was a few months into the first semester of his sophomore year that he\u2019d walked into the library and met eyes with a familiar face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d They say at the same time, pointing at each other, like that spiderman meme.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cItachiyama ace!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKarasuno manager\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s eyes drift to the girl\u2019s backpack and the very bright rainbow pin on the front pouch, catching his attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares up at her.</p>\n<p>She tilts her head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna sit with me?\u201d Sakusa asks before he can chicken out, motioning to a free table.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure!\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Sakusa-san, right? I\u2019m Yachi! Yachi Hitoka!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa never thought he\u2019d be saying this, but his mom was right about one thing. When he got to university, he did meet great girls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, one (1) girl. Just the one.</p>\n<p>Sakusa awkwardly returns her smile as they pull out their seats. \u201cHow\u2019re the guys from Karasuno?\u201d</p>\n<p>She goes on a tangent after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It\u2019s strange</em>, Sakusa thinks, as he listens to her talk. For some reason, he feels it in an instant.</p>\n<p>The feeling that it was the beginning of something really important.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s half a year into the friendship that Sakusa gathers the nerve to ask Yachi about her sexuality.</p>\n<p>She tells him she\u2019s a lesbian as if she were just telling him what she had for lunch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t ask him back, the way that Atsumu hadn\u2019t, years ago, and he wonders if the fear is written all over his face.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t ask, but he says it anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yachi smiles and reaches out to squeeze his hand. They stay like that for a few seconds before she exhales, turns to him and asks,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, that new episode of BNHA. Thoughts?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa loves her very, very much at that moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He then has flashbacks to last night, crying over Mirio smiling at Eri despite the fact that he\u2019s bleeding all over. \u201cAnd prayers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa Kiyoomi firmly believes that he wouldn\u2019t have survived past college without the existence of Komori Motoya and Yachi Hitoka.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through them, he makes a few friends, he goes to a few parties, he makes out with a few boys, drunkenly. (He does not remember their names or their faces for the life of him, though.)</p>\n<p>He lives. He lets himself live, just a little bit.</p>\n<p>The night before his graduation, he sits in his couch with the two, Komori only half conscious and Yachi going on another one of her tangents about how her first love, Kiyoko (Karasuno\u2019s manager before her, apparently), had ended up being straight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She finishes her woeful rant with a drunken sigh and turns to look at Sakusa with hooded eyes and pink cheeks. \u201cWhat \u2018bout you, Sakusa-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Sakusa hums, lolling his head to the side to look at her, ignoring the way his brain seems to be turning into mush in his skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour first love!\u201d Yachi exclaims, throwing her hands in the air, \u201cYou\u2019ve never told me about him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori nearly wakes himself up with his own snore, but promptly falls back asleep.</p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst love\u2026\u201d He muses, staring at the ceiling, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi gapes at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Sakusa continues, licking his lips, \u201cI\u2019ve only ever\u2026 had feelings for one person.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi scoots closer to him, attentive as ever. \u201cWho was it? A teammate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa knows how many wounds he\u2019d be opening with this, but he does it anyway. Because he\u2019s in a room, drunk, with no one but Komori and Yachi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knows it\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya Atsumu.\u201d He says. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a <em> was, </em> he\u2019s a\u2026 he\u2019s a <em> still. </em> He\u2019s an\u2026 <em> all the time.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Yachi stays quiet. Komori stops snoring. Sakusa thinks he\u2019s half awake, half listening.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call him a first love. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s <em> like. </em>But he\u2019ll always mean something to me, I think.\u201d Sakusa explains, running his fingers over the cold of his beer can. \u201cHe was my first\u2026 everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything?\u201d Yachi whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything that mattered, anyway.\u201d Sakusa clarifies, \u201cAnd then, I ruined it. I hurt him. I hurt myself. It was\u2026 not great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi turns to face the ceiling, head resting against the back of the couch, mirroring Sakusa\u2019s position, \u201cWhy\u2019d you ruin it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I knew that if I didn\u2019t pull away, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself.\u201d A lump starts forming in Sakusa\u2019s throat. He pushes it down, forces his voice out, \u201cAnd letting myself love him means my parents will stop loving me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wills himself not to get emotional. Keeps his eyes trained on the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Yachi lays her head on his shoulder and Sakusa lets himself rest his cheek on top of her head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they stop loving you because of that,\u201d Yachi says gently, \u201cI don\u2019t think they truly loved you in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. \u201cI know. That scares me even more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori shifts in his position and leans against Sakusa\u2019s other side. Sakusa instantly shoves him off and he falls like a limp vegetable against the arm rest.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove ya, Sakusa Kiyoomi.\u201d He mumbles drunkenly, \u201cForever \u2018n always, my dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi giggles. \u201cDitto.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa swipes at his eyes with the back of his hand. \u201cDisgusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi pats his knee comfortingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like he means a lot to you,\u201d She says, closing her eyes, \u201cYou should tell him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa chuckles sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m ever gonna get the chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d His new coach says, patting his shoulder, and motioning to the guys standing in front of him with one arm, \u201cThis is your new team. Welcome to the MSBY Jackals, Sakusa Kiyoomi!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, hey!\u201d Bokuto cheers, reaching out to give him a hug, before catching himself, and shrinking back. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a minute, Sakusa-kun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa-saaaaaan!\u201d Hinata yells, pumping his fists in the air, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re joining us! I\u2019ve kinda been hoping you\u2019d join us after college! We\u2019ve been betting, you see-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBokuto, Hinata, please,\u201d Meian begs, giving Sakusa an apologetic look, pulling them back by the collars of their shirts, \u201cSorry about them, Sakusa-kun. I\u2019m the captain, Meian.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa bows, trying his damn hardest not to let his gaze roam to a certain blonde who\u2019s rooted in place, staring at him. Sakusa didn\u2019t wanna know what expression he was wearing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOliver and Adriah aren\u2019t here right now, so I\u2019ll introduce them to you later but\u2026 well, this is Inunaki, our libero,\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa nods at him and Inunaki smiles at him, nodding back. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d Sakusa manages.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I guess you already know these guys,\u201d Meian says, motioning to the other three. \u201cThey say they all played you in high school. Said you were terrifying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa smiles at that. A genuine one. \u201cI\u2019ll take it as a compliment. They were all monsters too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, they are.\u201d Meian nods. \u201cI think you\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think the same.\u201d The coach says, clapping Sakusa on the back harshly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa-kun! Can you show us your bendy wrist thing aga-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, the one where he can fold it until his fingers touch his ar-\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa finally lets himself look at the man standing at the farthest end of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu looked\u2026 <em> sacred </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he looked good back then, Sakusa didn\u2019t even know where to begin with the way he looked now. His formerly straight, mustard colored hair has now faded into a light, golden shade, falling in slightly curled waves. He kept the undercut.</p>\n<p>And both his arms and legs are\u2026 sinful, as always.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi.\u201d Atsumu calls out, sounding exactly the way he did five years ago. \u201cLong time no see?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Atsumu smiles it holds no anger or pain, not the way it did the last time he\u2019d heard that nickname. He says his name as if their last conversation had never happened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s glad. He looked better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But a part of him, a small part, feels a slight sting at the thought that maybe that night six years ago didn\u2019t mean as much to Atsumu as it did to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLong time, Miya.\u201d Sakusa says, expression softening against his will.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The air around Miya Atsumu feels different. Where he used to be jagged and uneven, he was now sharper and smoother. When he used to seem arrogant and stand-offish, it\u2019s toned down into an aura of confidence and ease.</p>\n<p>Miya Atsumu had changed over the last five years. They\u2019re twenty two now and it shows.</p>\n<p>But Sakusa looks at him and still feels the exact same way he did when he was fifteen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still there. It\u2019s still the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, it\u2019s <em> stronger</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he wants to kiss him again. <em> God </em>, does he want to. He wants to close the space between them and kiss him, right now, this instant, in front of everyone. He thinks, maybe he can do it now. He\u2019s done it before with a few boys, drunk, at a party.</p>\n<p>But he knows he can\u2019t. He knows this is different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu smiles, reaching forward to pat him on the shoulder. \u201cI guess I kinda missed ya, Omi-Omi. Welcome to the team.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Atsumu squeezes his shoulder, Sakusa looks him in the eye, and that\u2019s when he sees it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A hint of affection, the same expression he\u2019d seen in his eyes when they shared heat and warmth in their shared bunk bed six years ago, the same expression he\u2019d never been able to make himself forget.</p>\n<p>And he knows at that moment, that for some reason, that night still meant something to him too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With Atsumu, it\u2019ll always be different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Sakusa kisses him, he\u2019ll probably fall in love with him. He\u2019ll probably fall instantly.</p>\n<p>He probably already has.\u00a0He never stood a fucking chance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Sakusa Kiyoomi</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m sending this message to the both of you at the same time to save my breath. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Komori, Yachi.

And that was the product of us being roommates for a measly four nights and five days. It only took 4 nights and the view of him in a towel for me to crack. Now, I\u2019ve been seeing him in a towel near daily and we\u2019re spending almost every waking hour together. Last night, we watched Attack on Titan and he fell asleep on my shoulder. He drooled all over it and I didn\u2019t even think it was gross. Think about that. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Last week, he made me blow dry his hair for him and it was so fucking soft.

Can you believe that? He wouldn\u2019t believe I actually liked him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa tries not to look like his eyes are about to pop out of their sockets. Holy shit. He joined the gayest volleyball team there is. He didn\u2019t even have to try. Maybe gay people are magnets.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so annoying!\u201d Hinata nods enthusiastically, \u201cI confessed to Kageyama after our first Nationals, but he wouldn\u2019t take me seriously! He was like, <em> no, you\u2019re delirious, you have a fever,\u201d </em>Hinata imitates in a scarily accurate way, pressing his hair down into a bowl cut in perfect Kageyama fashion, \u201cand I was like, yes, I have a fever but I\u2019m also in love! Those two things are separate!\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sighs longingly, resting his chin on his hand. \u201cMust be nice\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Oliver zips his bag closed, the only one so far who looks freshened up and ready to go. \u201cOh, not this again. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t get in your head about being the only single one here. Self pity is not a good look on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu pouts. \u201cIt\u2019s <em> not </em>self-pity. Can\u2019t a guy be lonely without bein\u2019 trash talked? Sheesh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Sakusa-san!\u201d Hinata yells, making Sakusa jump slightly at suddenly being included into the conversation, \u201cI realized we\u2019ve never asked you! Are you seeing anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa nearly chokes on his spit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To cover up his embarrassment, he combs his fingers through his hair, pushing his curls back, and he sees Atsumu\u2019s loaded stare from the corner of his eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hates it, but it\u2019s nice to know he\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s still affected.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d He answers, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHasn\u2019t really been a priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go, Tsum-Tsum!\u201d Bokuto says, cheerily, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only single one in the team!\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu just stares at him, eyes narrowing as Sakusa stares back. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>It lasts a few seconds before Sakusa turns away, fishing for his sports drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be all that miserable,\u201d Meian says, coming out of the showers with a towel around his waist, \u201cYou\u2019ve had the most interesting sex life, haven\u2019t you? You at least have <em> that </em> hanging over our heads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa chokes on his Gatorade.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu smiles, looking thoroughly entertained. Sakusa wants to kiss the stupid smirk off his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cJealous, Omi-kun?\u201d He teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick your fucking ass, Miya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy favorite story is the one where he was getting his ass eaten and someone walked in.\u201d Hinata shares, making half the team laugh, and the other half groan.</p>\n<p>Sakusa would literally rather be anywhere but here.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face scrunches up. \u201cGood to know you like that one, \u2018cause that was terrible for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa stands abruptly, making the rest quiet down, staring at him curiously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s knowing expression is infuriating.</p>\n<p>He realizes he should say something.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go shower.\u201d He announces, before swiftly turning away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s in the safety of one of the shower stalls with water cascading over his back, it\u2019s only then that he lets out the breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ass eating. Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, in the middle of his mental breakdown, he hears the rest of his teammates leave the locker room, followed by footsteps making their way to where he was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears the shower door right next to his open and then close, and listens as the shower turns on, followed by Atsumu\u2019s voice, humming a song he doesn\u2019t recognize.</p>\n<p>Sakusa thinks about how Atsumu likes having his ass eaten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also thinks about how he\u2019s completely naked right now in the stall right next to him.</p>\n<p>And then he thinks about how he was greeted this morning with the view of Atsumu in nothing but boxers, in all his bed-headed glory, with a <em> \u201cG\u2019mornin\u2019, Omi. Make me coffee?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>His soapy hand drifts down to his chest, ghosting over his nipples, down his stomach, until they\u2019re hovering over the hair covering his crotch.</p>\n<p>He thinks about Atsumu from six years ago, hand wrapped around his cock, he thinks about the Atsumu right next to him, he thinks about what it would be like to just\u2026</p>\n<p>He wraps his hand around his cock decidedly, stroking slowly at first, fist loose, leaning his forehead against the wall, biting his bottom lip to keep his noises in.</p>\n<p>As Atsumu continues to hum, he strokes faster, tightening his hand around himself, using his free hand to grip onto the grab bar to ground himself.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize it when his breathing turns into soft, barely-there-but-there groans. So, he doesn\u2019t hear it when the shower stall next to him goes silent.</p>\n<p>He keeps stroking, breaths quickening, when he\u2019s interrupted with an, \u201cOmi? What the fuck\u2019re ya doin\u2019 in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa freezes, hand tightening painfully around his cock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because he realizes the voice isn\u2019t coming from the stall next to him. It\u2019s coming from right outside his door.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fucking mortified but somehow, that turns him on even more. He\u2019s fucked. He squeezes his eyes closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds like bullshit even to him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause. He sees the bare feet under the door shuffling closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure didn\u2019t sound like nothin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa wanted to die. There\u2019s no getting out of this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> know </em> what I was doing.\u201d Sakusa decides to say, voice low and urgent, \u201cNow can you go away so I can\u2026 I don\u2019t fucking know, finish off here-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fuck. FUCK. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Sakusa gulps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He holds on tightly to his last shred of dignity and self-control as he takes a deep steadying breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu scoffs. \u201cAre <em> you?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa nearly cries, one hand already reaching out for the lock.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cFuck, </em>Atsumu,\u201d He groans, \u201cWhy do you still get me going after all these years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen the fuckin\u2019 door, Omi, or I\u2019m breakin\u2019 it down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa rips the door open and drags Atsumu in by the arm, instantly latching onto his lips.</p>\n<p>Atsumu moans loudly, throwing his arms around his neck, as Sakusa reaches behind him to lock the door again.</p>\n<p>As they press their bodies closer together, their cocks rub against each other, and Sakusa growls at the way that Atsumu\u2019s already fully hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you getting hard listening to me?\u201d He asks against Atsumu\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He hisses, grabbing onto Sakusa\u2019s hair, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They fit together like they were never apart. It feels almost like they\u2019re picking up right where they left off, hands all over each other, as if trying to touch everything they\u2019d missed last time, all their movements more confident and sure compared to the first time. More desperate, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Atsumu breathes out, \u201cFuck, Omi, kiss my neck, mark me up, all over-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBathroom, bathroom, bathroom~\u201d They hear from a close distance, the off pitch singing accompanied by skipping sounds and what sounded like Bokuto doing the ad libs that consisted of, \u201cHey, hey, heeeey, bathroom, oh yeaaaah~\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hands freeze up, gripping onto Sakusa\u2019s waist so tightly it hurts, letting out a soft whine. He should cut his damn nails.</p>\n<p>Sakusa raises a finger to his lips, silently telling Atsumu to shut the fuck up.</p>\n<p>They stay quiet as they hear the sounds of pissing, a locker opening and closing, and the tap running.</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa-san? Atsumu-san?\u201d Hinata calls out, \u201cYou guys not done yet? Everyone\u2019s ready!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026 m\u2019almost done, Shoyo-kun!\u201d Atsumu yells, sounding so casual it\u2019s almost impressive.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Sakusa adds, hoping he sounds just as convincing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p>\n<p>As the footsteps fade and then disappear, the two finally breathe again, sagging against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Atsumu asks, pushing Sakusa\u2019s hair back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill them.\u201d He grunts.</p>\n<p>Atsumu giggles at that, fucking <em> giggles, </em>and that makes Sakusa actually look at him and\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh no.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He hurriedly grips onto Atsumu\u2019s shoulders, lightly pushing him away, trying to gather his thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The change in Atsumu\u2019s expression is almost instant. He goes from giggly to exasperated in the span of half a second.</p>\n<p>As Sakusa turns the shower off and is about to reach for the lock, Atsumu takes hold of his wrist, using his other hand to push him against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-\u201d Sakusa sputters, trying to break free, \u201cWhat the fuck do you mean no, I was just gonna--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, yer gonna run away from me.\u201d Atsumu presses, \u201c<em> Again. </em>Ya can\u2019t do that, Omi. We live together. We work together. Ya can\u2019t pull this shit again. We aren\u2019t teenagers anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa bites his tongue and tastes blood. He <em> wasn\u2019t </em>gonna run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shit, that doesn\u2019t sound convincing even in his head.</p>\n<p>Atsumu stares at him for a long time, searching his expression, and Sakusa has no choice but to face him head on, let him look at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu deserved at least that much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sakusa asks, voice reduced to a weak whisper.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face softens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019re you so scared of this?\u201d He asks, sounding close to desperate. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell me now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The expression on Atsumu\u2019s face at that moment is so raw that it hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa finds himself having to hold onto Atsumu\u2019s arms to keep himself up, literally and metaphorically. He takes a deep breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019s gonna be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He presses his forehead against Atsumu\u2019s, watches as his eyelids flutter close.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d He admits, \u201cI want you so badly that for a second, I think\u2026 I\u2019d be willing to give them up. I\u2019d be willing to give it all up, if I get to have this just a little longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu thinks, <em> give them up? </em>Atsumu thinks, looks back, and remembers hearing all the rumors about his family, hearing about how Sakusa Kiyoomi was a rich kid who studied in a fucking Catholic school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu realizes, ah. <em> Them. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBut I <em> can\u2019t.\u201d </em>He says and his voice is trembling.</p>\n<p>Atsumu realizes then and there, how much he wants this. And at the same time, realizes then and there, that he can\u2019t have it.</p>\n<p>Not like this.</p>\n<p>Atsumu sighs. \u201cHow \u2018bout this, Omi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa looks up at him and he looks so unintentionally vulnerable, it hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do things that\u2019ll make ya wanna run away.\u201d Atsumu says, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wanna get hurt anymore. I know ya don\u2019t mean to, but it hurts anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa at least has the decency to look guilty.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is something that I can\u2019t really help with, right?\u201d Atsumu continues, steadying his breath, \u201cSo\u2026 no more of this, no more\u2026 <em> any </em> of this. At least not until ya figure yer shit out and decide on how ya wanna live yer life. How \u2018bout we just do this the normal way, be friends, be roommates, take it slow, \u2018n see where that takes us. Is that alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa blinks at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, sure, but,\u201d He licks his lips, \u201cI think this conversation would be more productive if we weren\u2019t having it naked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks down. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Sakusa continues, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry for everything. And, I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re being\u2026 you know\u2026 <em> you. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face contorts into an expression of pain. \u201cGod, ya gotta stop talkin\u2019 to me like that, yer gonna kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa raises his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes a deep breath. Inhales, exhales.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Friends, Omi-Omi?\u201d He asks, reaching a hand out, initiating a\u2026 handshake.</p>\n<p>Sakusa wants to laugh. They\u2019re fucking <em> naked </em>here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grabs the hand, shaking it firmly. \u201cFriends.

The referee motions to them with his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The MSBY Jackals win against EJP Raijin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn yer fuckin\u2019 <em> face, </em>Sunarin!\u201d Atsumu yells at the top of his lungs, throwing his fists in the air. \u201cBow down to tha superior Miya Twin!\u201d</p>\n<p>He glances at the audience and sees Osamu with his arms crossed in front of his chest, somehow managing to look both annoyed and proud.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get ya next time.\u201d Suna promises, as both teams line up and shake each other\u2019s hands under the net.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a long way to go before you catch up to me, Komori.\u201d Sakusa says, reaching out to shake his cousin\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shove it.\u201d Komori laughs, the smile on his face betraying his words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, they find themselves surrounded by different groups of different people. Oliver\u2019s wife and kids, Adriah\u2019s fiance, Hinata\u2019s mom, little sister, and of course, Kageyama Tobio with a bouquet of roses. There\u2019s Bokuto with his friends and boyfriend. Atsumu, Osamu, their parents, Suna Rintarou and his grandmother, some Inarizaki alumni were there too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camera flashes start to get blinding.</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns around and sees his own parents making their way towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy beautiful boy!\u201d His mother coos, holding Sakusa\u2019s face in her hands. \u201cYou were amazing!\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad pats him on the back and ruffles his hair. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Kiyoomi. You\u2019ve been doing amazing things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa smiles. Despite everything, he still liked hearing their praise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori slides up next to him, throwing an arm around his shoulders, bringing Yachi along with him. \u201cGood game!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two were great!\u201d Yachi exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Yach.\u201d Sakusa says, patting her hair down, fighting the urge to hug her like he usually would, lest his parents start thinking there was something between them. That\u2019d be an awkward conversation. \u201cGlad you came.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori\u2019s parents and his own bring out their phones, motioning for the three of them to stand together so they can take more pictures than Sakusa thinks is necessary.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of smiling and camera flashes and praise, until the moment is broken with a change in expression in his father\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leans down and whispers something to his mother.</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns around to see whatever they\u2019re looking at and he finds that it\u2019s the Miya family taking selfies together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu\u2019s arm was wrapped around Suna\u2019s shoulders and Suna\u2019s arms were wrapped around his waist, as Osamu pressed a wet kiss to his cheek. Atsumu pretends to look grossed out (\u201cCan\u2019t ya guys keep it in yer pants for a fuckin\u2019 second?\u201d \u201cAtsumu! Language!\u201d), and their parents smile brightly at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that your roommate, Kiyoomi?\u201d His dad asks, subtly motioning to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori turns, sees what he\u2019s referring to, and his grip on Sakusa\u2019s shoulder tightens. A silent comfort.</p>\n<p>Yachi has a steadying hand on his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sakusa chokes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis twin is\u2026\u201d His mom hesitates, making a face that looked weary, \u201cIs Atsumu also...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Yeah, he is. Your son is the same, too. Are you gonna look at me like that too if you knew? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, mom.\u201d Sakusa chooses to say instead, turning away from the Miya family, apologizing to them in his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2026 talk about that. We\u2019re just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa-san!\u201d Hinata yells from a few feet away, wrapped in a Kageyama Tobio back hug, \u201cWe\u2019re partying at our apartment later! You coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d He says to his parents, giving them both quick one-armed hugs, then squeezing Komori\u2019s shoulder and patting Yachi\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll see you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom opens her mouth, as if to say something more, eyeing the rest of his teammates. At the way Osamu and Suna are wrapped around each other, at the press of Kageyama\u2019s lips against Hinata\u2019s temple, at the way Bokuto lifts Akaashi in his arms and spins him around.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to see the disgust in his parents\u2019 faces looking at everything Sakusa had ever wanted for himself and could never get.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At that moment, Atsumu turns to look at him and flashes him a smile.\u00a0Not a playful one, not a cocky one, but the special one he saves just for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Wow </em> , you know what. This was not fine. He was <em> not </em>fine.</p>\n<p>Bokuto and Hinata had better have some fucking whiskey at their place or else he was leaving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The perks of living in an apartment complex with his teammates was that none of them had to worry about getting too drunk at after parties and not being able to make it home, because home was always just one elevator ride away.</p>\n<p>The cons of living in an apartment complex with his teammates was living in a fucking apartment complex with his teammates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re tolerable at this point, hell, Sakusa even <em> likes </em>them sometimes. And maybe if he were drunk enough, he wouldn\u2019t be feeling so murderous over hearing Bokuto belt What\u2019s New Pussycat for the fourth time in a row.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first two times for fun, the next two times for serenading those two Nekoma guys, Kenma and Kuroo apparently, through a video call.</p>\n<p>(Bless them. They at least pretended to be amused. At least that Kenma guy did. Kuroo was downright having the time of his life.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kageyama and Akaashi seemed to be the only ones in the room who were still in their right minds, but only because they\u2019re on babysitting duty for the sake of their respective boyfriends.</p>\n<p>Hinata had thrown up twice in the past hour and a half, and Kageyama looked one more bathroom trip away from cutting him off for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p>Bokuto is\u2026. Bokuto. Sakusa can\u2019t even be sure if he\u2019s actually drunk or just being him. Inunaki is passed out on a beanbag chair. Meian had left thirty minutes ago, claiming he was getting way too old for this. Oliver and Adriah are fucking married with kids, so they\u2019re <em> definitely </em>above this.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s drunk too, not as drunk as he wished he was, but drunk all the same. At least, enough for him to be playing with Atsumu\u2019s hand resting on his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d He slurs, droopy eyes gazing up at him, \u201cD\u2019ya think the new hand cream Tobio recommended is working? I can\u2019t tell if my hands are gettin\u2019 softer or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa runs his fingers over Atsumu\u2019s palm, feeling each of his fingers one by one. Atsumu stretches out his hand and Sakusa does the same, sliding their palms against each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re calloused as fuck.\u201d Sakusa answers. \u201cBeyond redemption.\u201d</p>\n<p>A dumb smile materializes on Atsumu\u2019s face because Sakusa curls his fingers into the spaces between his anyway, and Atsumu does the same, interlacing them together.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are yours.\u201d Atsumu shoots back. He runs a thumb back and forth over Sakusa\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Their joint hands rest on Sakusa\u2019s thigh, gloves forgotten on the table in front of them. Atsumu sighs contentedly.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to them, the room goes a little quieter, everyone\u2019s attention at least half on them. Bokuto tries to film them inconspicuously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, I\u2019m kinda honored.\u201d Atsumu chuckles, turning his head slightly, so his cheek touches Sakusa\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou hate being touched by everyone else, but ya never mind when it\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa grunts, his fingers tightening around his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa looks at him, his cheeks slightly red from the alcohol. And he smiles a smile that doesn\u2019t really reach his eyes. It looks sad, almost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s chest tightens. <em> Why? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Miya.\u201d Sakusa says it like it pains him, like he wishes he had a different answer, \u201cIf I knew, maybe I\u2019d know how to make it stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu swallows, unable to look away, the noise of the apartment being drowned out by the sound of his heartbeat. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa was starting to understand how alcohol can ruin entire lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He breathes out a weak laugh, looks away before he can think of doing something stupid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d He says with a tone of finality, closing his eyes. \u201cFriends, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu bites his bottom lip. \u201cWe\u2019re holding hands, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa hums, showing no intention of letting up on his grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been weird.\u201d He points out, leaning forward to properly rest his cheek on Sakusa\u2019s shoulder, staring curiously. \u201cYou\u2019ve been weirdly broody fer someone who just won a game.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa hums again, his eyes still closed, head tilted back against the back of the couch. Atsumu stares at the two moles above his eyebrow.</p>\n<p>God, the lighting here made him look <em> holy. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d He asks, making sure his voice is low enough for only Sakusa to hear. Not that the others would hear, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bokuto and Hinata are doing their rendition of Livin\u2019 La Vida Loca. It\u2019s strangely impressive.</p>\n<p>It feels like forever before he blinks his eyes open, although in reality it\u2019s probably mere seconds.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s gaze is stubbornly trained on the ceiling when he speaks. \u201cAtsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s heart skips a beat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The only times he\u2019d ever called him by his given name was whenever they were\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna go home.\u201d He declares and he sounds so <em> tired </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t know how to explain it, doesn\u2019t understand where it\u2019s coming from, exactly. But it scares him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can go.\u201d Atsumu assures him, squeezing his hand. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine with it. I\u2019ll make up some excuse for ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns his head, finally properly meeting his gaze. \u201cI meant with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels a tiny explosion go off in the pits of his stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Welp. There goes half his common sense.</p>\n<p>He has to hold on really fucking tightly to the remaining half now.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d He starts, in an almost scolding tone, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few drinks, if you wanna\u2026 do something like that, I don\u2019t think we should be making that decision while we\u2019re\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking mean it like <em> that.\u201d </em>Sakusa groans, sounding exasperated, \u201cJust\u2026 can we please just go home?\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a minute for the hidden meaning in his words to sink in but when they do, Atsumu softens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t just another momentary lapse in judgement born out of horniness and loneliness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa was simply asking for his company.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Omi-Omi.\u201d Atsumu whispers, pressing a barely there kiss to his shoulder, feeling the need to comfort him for some reason. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They find themselves in their living room, sprawled across the couch, each of them holding onto a bottle of beer. Atsumu has his legs resting on top of Sakusa\u2019s lap, laying his head on the arm rest. Sakusa focuses on chugging his beer, his free arm resting on top of Atsumu\u2019s legs, running his hand up and down his leg hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weirdly intimate.</p>\n<p>Atsumu finds it suspicious that none of their teammates had even tried to make them stay when he\u2019d told them they were leaving. If anything, they were practically pushing them out the door. He\u2019ll have to interrogate them tomorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But for now...</p>\n<p>They\u2019d been here, sitting in this exact position, drinking their beers in total silence for at least twenty minutes now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not an uncomfortable silence. After being roommates for several months, their silences are at a point where they\u2019re always comfortable, so that\u2019s not the problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s that Atsumu doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s supposed to be doing here. Was he supposed to be comforting him? Giving him advice? Speaking words of wisdom\u2026 let it be dot mp3?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is nice \u2018n all,\u201d Atsumu starts, wiggling his toes, \u201cBut I\u2019m kinda dyin\u2019 of curiosity here, Omi. So before I fall asleep with ya touchin\u2019 my legs like that, I gotta ask\u2026 Are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu notices that Sakusa looks properly drunk now. The man can barely open his eyes. And yet, he <em> still </em>looked gorgeous. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re fucked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s shocked by the honesty. He always expected Sakusa to be the type of guy who had his shit together even when he was wasted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He asks, lowering his beer bottle, the bottom of it pressing against his stomach, the cold seeping into his skin.</p>\n<p>Sakusa seems to mull it over, one hand clutching his beer so tightly that Atsumu sees the tips of his fingers turn white, his other hand tracing patterns on his leg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA part of me,\u201d Sakusa begins, blinking blearily, his words slightly slurred, \u201cA part of me really wants to just\u2026 talk about it. You know? I wanna get it out there, so it doesn\u2019t feel like this <em> weight </em>inside me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods, silently encouraging him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the other part of me,\u201d He continues, the fingers against his skin pausing in their ministrations, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to say it out loud, because then it\u2019ll feel too real\u2026 and too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu thinks about it, the way he\u2019s been thinking about it all these years, if he\u2019s being honest. He thinks about how exactly he can help this person who doesn\u2019t know how to help himself or how to let others help him.</p>\n<p>He hates to even think about it, but at times like these, he turns to <em>Solution:</em> <em>WWSD.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>What Would Samu Do?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pictures his brother\u2019s face, searches his memories of past conversations in times of trial and what his brother would always tell him whenever he\u2026 <em> Oh. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d Atsumu says, sitting up so abruptly that Sakusa jumps a little, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sakusa grumbles, \u201cYou never have any good ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, technically, it would be Samu\u2019s idea but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, then okay. What idea?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWow.\u201d </em> Atsumu huffs, looking genuinely betrayed. \u201cOkay, rude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the idea?\u201d Sakusa presses, head lolling to the side, tiredly. It\u2019s stupidly adorable.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow \u2018bout you tell me all about it in third person? In story form?\u201d Atsumu asks, reaching out to set his beer bottle down on the coffee table. \u201cWhen Samu and I were kids and we needed to tell each other somethin\u2019 that felt too embarrassing or lame, we\u2019d go like, <em> so I know this guy\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Atsumu agrees. \u201cBut it works better than ya\u2019d think.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Sakusa still looks hesitant, Atsumu decides to take matters into his own hands. If he wants the man to open up, well then, he\u2019s just gonna have to show him that it\u2019s a safe place to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll have to do it first.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> I </em> know this guy,\u201d Atsumu says conversationally, \u201cHe\u2019s really cool, really good-looking, and is <em> much </em>better than his twin brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, I already hate this guy.\u201d Sakusa deadpans, but the hint of a smile on his face tells Atsumu otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe may be the perfect picture of confidence \u2018n sex appeal now, but just a few years ago, he was kind of a hot mess.\u201d He exhales, resting his chin on his hand, \u201cFer awhile there\u2026 he thought there was truly somethin\u2019 wrong with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu half expects Sakusa to mock him as he always does, say something like, <em> there\u2019s a lot wrong with you, </em>but he doesn\u2019t. He seems to realize that Atsumu\u2019s trying to bare his soul here.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrowin\u2019 up, he had a bunch of crushes, pretty boys, pretty girls, but he never had the nerve to do anything about it. \u2018Cause he knew a lot of people didn\u2019t really understand who he was \u2018n he was scared that he\u2019d be shunned.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa squeezes his leg lightly in an attempt to comfort.</p>\n<p>Atsumu gives him a reassuring smile. \u201cS\u2019funny now because now he doesn\u2019t really care at all anymore, but back then it bothered him. I think the only reason he never broke was because he had his brother \u2018n his parents backin\u2019 him up. And then he had volleyball \u2018n his team. After that, he was set fer life. Not everyone\u2019s so lucky, though, right? He knows that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe had his first boyfriend when he was fourteen \u2018n it was a secret. Only lasted a coupla months. Whenever things got too sexual, he\u2019d panic \u2018n be like, I\u2019m not ready. I think he felt like doin\u2019 anything like that would make it too real, y\u2019know? Plus, back then, he was kinda insecure about his belly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa chuckles softly. \u201cHe had one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods, gravely. \u201cHe worked real hard to get rid of it, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile on Sakusa\u2019s face is so gentle it almost makes him cry. \u201cIt was probably cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Atsumu mumbles, struggling to hide his blush. \u201cAnyway, it doesn\u2019t last long \u2018n he realizes he didn\u2019t really like this guy <em> that </em>much anyway. So, it ends. And then a year later, he\u2019s in a volleyball match against a real strong team \u2018n sees a really fuckin\u2019 pretty boy on the other side of the net.\u201d</p>\n<p>The expression on Sakusa\u2019s face is hard to read.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t keep his fuckin\u2019 eyes off him.\u201d Atsumu whispers, reverently, like it\u2019s a secret. \u201cHasn\u2019t been able to since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot.\u201d Sakusa says under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I think so too.\u201d Atsumu sighs. \u201cBut he can\u2019t really help it, can he? So, he meets this guy, right? This broody, gorgeous, pretentious sunnofa--\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHey.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Atsumu giggles. \u201cHe meets him and\u2026 it\u2019s almost instant. It\u2019s like he knows right away that he\u2019s gonna be someone special to him, y\u2019know? It\u2019s so weird. D\u2019ya think it\u2019s weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa purses his lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu smiles. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets so fuckin\u2019 bad \u2018cause he\u2019s so <em> taken </em> by him, y\u2019know? And it doesn\u2019t help that this pretty boy would look at him like\u2026\u201d Atsumu inhales, makes some big motion with his arms, \u201c.... like he was <em> wanted. </em>He looked at him like he couldn\u2019t stand him, but couldn\u2019t stay away from him.\u201d</p>\n<p>The grip Sakusa has on his leg tightens.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when they start talking\u2026 like, <em> really </em>talking, the boy realizes he thinks he\u2019s found someone he doesn\u2019t mind lettin\u2019 in. In more ways than one.\u201d Atsumu winks, earning muted laughter from the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut when he lets him in, he gets pushed back out\u2026 and that hurts. It hurts a fuckin\u2019 lot. So, he\u2019s just stuck on this guy for so long, for a reason that he doesn\u2019t even understand himself. And after the guy pisses him off in a bathroom, he starts lookin\u2019 for anybody to keep him warm, to prove that this pretty curly haired boy wasn\u2019t all that special\u2026 but as it turns out, he is. He\u2019s real fuckin\u2019 special. It\u2019s been six years of him being special to him, fer what it\u2019s worth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he just really believes they could be somethin\u2019 really good, <em> really fucking good </em> , if they just\u2026 took a <em> chance </em> .\u201d Atsumu finishes, looking at Sakusa like he\u2019s begging for something, \u201cIf he just\u2026 helped him <em> understand </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa gulps, his pupils shake, and his hands tremble as he sets his beer down onto the table. He brings them together in an attempt to make the shaking stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy story isn't fun.\u201d He admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not expecting it to be.\u201d Atsumu retorts.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s hands don\u2019t stop shaking. Atsumu winces at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf\u2026 if it\u2019s too hard, ya don\u2019t need to force yerself right away-\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa seems to deliberate something in his head for a moment, before he decidedly reaches out, laying his hand on Atsumu\u2019s lap, palm up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes a little too long staring at it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s fingers twitch. \u201cAre you gonna hold my fucking hand or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu kinda likes honest Sakusa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He bites back a fond smile as he lays his hand on top of his, squeezing it comfortingly.</p>\n<p>Sakusa lets out a long breath and Atsumu can tell he\u2019s relieved.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know a guy,\u201d He begins, his grip on Atsumu\u2019s hand already tightening. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 a <em>liar.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis parents were raised to believe in one thing and so he was raised the same. That\u2019s all it ever really was. They were only ever doing what they\u2019d been taught to do, what they believed was right. Because they loved their only son so much.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn school, he learns that God loves all, that he is forgiving, that he does not judge, that he does not close his doors on anyone who is good. But, he also learns that none of that applies to you when you\u2019re gay.\u201d He snorts in a way that lacks any humor, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that much at first. He was a kid, what the hell did he know? So, gay people go to hell. So, God didn\u2019t like them. So, his parents didn\u2019t like them. He didn\u2019t really get it, but what\u2019d that have to do with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not until he turns fifteen that it starts to matter. He\u2019s fifteen and he\u2019s in this volleyball game\u2026 and he sees this cocky mustard haired bastard across the volleyball net and suddenly it has <em> everything </em> to do with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s grip around his hand tightens impossibly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so, he\u2019s scared. Fucking terrified. And he does everything in his power to hide it, to change it, make it go away. He tries everything he can think of. He prays, ten times a day. He watches all the movies and all the porn the boys in his school rave about. He gets a girlfriend and dates her for a year, tolerates the touching, the kissing, pretends and tries to believe that he can live his entire life <em> tolerating. </em>He lies. He lies to everyone and he lies to himself. Because it\u2019s all he can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe comes out to his cousin. He cries. He turns sixteen. A boy on the news commits suicide because he\u2019s gay. He goes to a training camp. He rooms with the entire reason any of this began in the fucking first place. He cracks. Because the boy is\u2026 he\u2019s too much. He looks at him and it\u2019s electric. He touches him and it\u2019s <em> searing. </em> He talks to him, he lets him in, he unintentionally breaks through the walls he\u2019d spent so long building, and <em> that </em> night\u2026 he feels like he\u2019s being welcomed home <em> .\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t fucking cry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see, the thing is, this guy is smart. At least, he thought he was. So, when he was fifteen and realized that this was the situation he was going to be in, he\u2019d started planning. He\u2019d study hard, get the best possible grades, be the best possible volleyball player, be the best at whatever the fuck he could be the best at. He always listened, never talked back, never got sick, never asked for anything. He thought maybe, just maybe, if he did all that, then being gay wouldn\u2019t matter that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s sixteen, a distant cousin comes out as gay. He reveals that he\u2019s been with his boyfriend for five years. His cousin\u2019s a doctor. He was an honor student his whole life. He graduated magna cum laude. His parents bragged about him on Facebook all the damn time. He came out as gay. And suddenly\u2026 suddenly, he just wasn\u2019t family anymore. To <em> any </em> of them. Just like that. Like it was so easy to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The breath he lets out is shaky. Atsumu rubs his thumb over the back of his hand, back and forth, back and forth. Sakusa focuses on the motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he realizes it doesn\u2019t matter how hard he tries. Once his parents find out, it\u2019s over. And so, he lies. He keeps lying. He gets another girlfriend. Tries again, even when he knows it\u2019d never work. He spends the next few years lying, hiding this part of himself that he\u2019d only ever said out loud to three people when he\u2019s been alive for twenty two years and has known for seven of them. He realizes that he just can\u2019t let go of the boy he\u2019d seen across the volleyball net at fifteen because these days, he looks at that same boy across their living room and feels the exact same thing\u2026 except it\u2019s heightened to the fucking millionth degree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s just so fucking <em>exhausted. </em>He\u2019s so fucking tired of hiding, of lying, of carrying this stupid weight inside him, but it\u2019s all he\u2019s ever done. It\u2019s all he knows how to do. And he looks at this boy, this stupidly <em>beautiful </em>boy and wants him so badly, but can\u2019t stop thinking of the cost. And he wonders, what the hell is he supposed to do? Give up his family for happiness? Will he be happier without them? How can he be sure of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. In and out. In and out. Don\u2019t fucking cry. Don\u2019t. <em> Don\u2019t. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it sounds stupid, right? It\u2019s stupid. Why is he worrying so much when he shouldn\u2019t be putting up with people who\u2019d shun him for being who he is? For loving who he loves? For something he can\u2019t fucking help? He\u2019s not that helpless fifteen year old kid anymore, living under their roof, living under their protection. He\u2019s twenty two and he\u2019s a working adult, paying the bills, living his fucking dream, and he worked damn hard to get there. He doesn\u2019t need his parents anymore. He can support himself without them. Why should it matter anymore, if they cut him off? Wouldn\u2019t it be okay for him to be selfish? Shouldn\u2019t it be okay now, at this point, to let himself be with someone he\u2019s wanted for <em> seven years?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Breathe. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA friend once told him that if someone stops loving you for who you are, then maybe they didn\u2019t truly love you in the first place.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Breathe, Sakusa Kiyoomi. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis parents used to tuck him in every night before bed, you know? His mother used to always read him bedtime stories. His father used to play volleyball with him in their backyard, even when his back hurt. They took care of him whenever he was sick. They never minded that he didn\u2019t always like being touched. They framed all his certificates, displayed all his medals, and went to every game they could. They always told him they loved him, they do even now, embarrassingly. And he keeps wondering, if he stops lying to them\u2026 will they stop lying too?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks up and finally faces Atsumu, voice breaking against his will when he asks,<em> \u201cIs it so bad for him to just want them to keep lying?\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cFuck.\u201d </em>Atsumu chokes out a sob, scrambling to get as close as he can, practically sitting on Sakusa\u2019s lap as he throws his arms around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cradles Sakusa\u2019s head into his chest, cries like it\u2019s the end of the fucking world, cries like he\u2019s doing it in his place, pressing kisses to the top of his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He whispers.</p>\n<p>When Sakusa exhales, it comes out as a full bodied shudder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He decides to allow himself this one moment of weakness, just this once, as he sinks into the embrace, sliding his arms around Atsumu\u2019s waist and holding on tight. He closes his eyes, breathes in, and buries his face into the comforting warmth.</p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t seem to stop weeping. Sakusa\u2019s chest fucking hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you crying so hard for, Miya?\u201d He asks, forcing out a watery chuckle, \u201cHe\u2019s just some guy I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a long while for Atsumu to stop hiccuping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At this point, Sakusa\u2019s sobered up considerably and he'd resorted to running his fingers through Atsumu\u2019s hair in what he hoped was a calming way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu sniffles again, staring at Sakusa pitifully, his eyes completely swollen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa can\u2019t help the laugh that escapes him. \u201cTell me why the hell <em> I\u2019m </em> the one comforting <em> you </em> right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em> knooooooow,\u201d </em>Atsumu whines, looking a second away from bursting into tears again, \u201cI\u2019m terrible at this! I\u2019m soooorry, Omi!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs again, a burst of fondness blooming in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches out his free hand to wipe one of Atsumu\u2019s tear streaked cheeks with his thumb. \u201cHopeless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is still half on Sakusa, legs thrown over his lap, Sakusa\u2019s one arm wrapped around him to keep him stable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Friends. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Who the fuck have they been trying to kid aside from themselves?</p>\n<p>They weren\u2019t just friends. They\u2019d never been just friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa says, voice suddenly turning solemn again, \u201cWhy <em> are </em> you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy takes a deep breath, gathering himself, before abruptly raising both his hands and sandwiching Sakusa\u2019s face between them. Sakusa makes a tiny noise of discomfort as Atsumu squeezes.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it so bad for me to cry for you, Omi-kun? Huh?\u201d Atsumu glares, \u201cIs it so bad that I don\u2019t like thinkin\u2019 about you hurting?\u201d</p>\n<p>The urge to cry may have left Atsumu, but it seems to transfer to Sakusa. He swallows the lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>He gives himself a moment to study the boy\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked\u2026 terrible. Atsumu\u2019s nose was obviously stuffy, his lips looked chapped, there were obvious tear streaks all over his face, his eyes were red and swollen, and don\u2019t even get him <em> started </em> on the oily, unkempt hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hands holding onto his face\u2026 <em>Wow,</em> they really are calloused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>God. He\u2019s perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi?\u201d Atsumu says his name like it\u2019s precious. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa raises his hands, takes hold of Atsumu\u2019s wrists, holds onto them like a lifeline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leans forward and kisses him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not rough or unpracticed, it\u2019s not frantic or rushed, instead, it\u2019s gentle and sincere while still being every bit as desperate as it always was.</p>\n<p>And it only takes Atsumu half a second of being frozen in place, just half, before he melts into it with a relieved sigh, closing his eyes, his hold on Sakusa\u2019s face laxing, rubbing his thumbs against his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Sakusa pulls away slightly, leaves another quick peck, then another, tilting his head to press a kiss against his cheek, then his neck, before burying his face in the juncture between Atsumu\u2019s neck and shoulder.</p>\n<p>They hold each other for a long time, hands caressing each other\u2019s backs, Atsumu\u2019s hand in his hair, calming.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Atsumu whispers against the shell of his ear.</p>\n<p>Sakusa shivers, his hold on him tightening. \u201cJust because.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d Atsumu\u2019s grip on his shirt stiffens. \u201cYer killin\u2019 me here.\u201d He says and it sounds pained.</p>\n<p>He keeps thinking, <em> just friends. They said they\u2019d just be friends. Just friends.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Just friends. Just friends. Just- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep with me.\u201d Sakusa says, lifting his head to look him in the eye, so that Atsumu knows he means it. It\u2019s not the alcohol. It\u2019s not a sudden rush of courage or a bout of loneliness. He isn\u2019t talking out of his dick. He means it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em> needs </em> it.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyes widen, examining every inch of Sakusa\u2019s face, and he can tell that Atsumu understands. He can tell that Atsumu can tell.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cPlease.\u201d </em> Sakusa whispers, voice quivering, pressing their foreheads together, running an unsteady hand over Atsumu\u2019s cheek, closing his eyes. <em> \u201cPlease.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa thinks he feels liquid against his fingers but he doesn\u2019t get the chance to check if Atsumu\u2019s crying again because suddenly they\u2019re kissing again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu whimpers into his mouth and Sakusa can\u2019t tell what kind it is. The crying kind or the turned on kind. Maybe both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Atsumu asks, pressing a soft kiss to Sakusa\u2019s jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t hesitate this time. Not this time. He tilts his head, as if giving Atsumu permission. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing like how things were when they were sixteen. It\u2019s nothing like how things were a few months ago in the shower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything, every movement, every press of lips against skin, fingers searching for warmth, were filled with a yearning, an intense want, every single feeling of the past seven years, rushing out of them in full force. It burns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels violent.</p>\n<p>But their hold on each other stays gentle. As if they\u2019re scared to break the moment. As if they\u2019re scared to break each other.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Atsumu who stands first, leads them to his bedroom, lightly pushes Sakusa down onto the bed, keeps his gaze trained on him, as if scared that he\u2019d disappear right before his eyes if he closed them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Sakusa who grabs onto his arms, touches every part of his body, kisses any part of him he could reach, as if terrified that he\u2019d go somewhere he couldn\u2019t reach if he stopped.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa moans against his mouth, \u201cAbout what I said six years ago,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t talk about sixteen year old us when we\u2019re about to have sex.\u201d Atsumu begs, grinding against Sakusa\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d Sakusa finishes.</p>\n<p>Atsumu freezes. He raises his head, looks into Sakusa\u2019s eyes. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I\u2019d top back then.\u201d Sakusa clarifies, running a hand through Atsumu\u2019s hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hands clench into fists against the sheets. <em> Dear God. </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s voice shakes but it does not falter as he breathes, \u201cI want you to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blood rushes directly into Atsumu\u2019s groin at an alarming speed but the cogs in his brain go on overdrive, wondering, <em> is this okay? </em></p>\n<p>When Sakusa senses the hesitation in him, he pushes himself up, kisses Atsumu long and hard, putting every bit of how he felt in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he pulls away, he repeats, \u201cI want this. I want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fuck. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWanted you for so long,\u201d Sakusa repeats, like a prayer almost, \u201cSo fucking long. <em> Please,\u201d </em>He\u2019s saying that word a lot tonight. \u201cI\u2019m not below begging right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something enchanting about watching someone who\u2019d only ever been so closed off, so rough, so hard to read, just completely surrender.</p>\n<p>Sakusa surrenders.</p>\n<p>Atsumu decides to catch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you beg, Omi,\u201d Atsumu assures him, pressing the tips of their noses together, \u201cBut yer gonna need to understand something about tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slowly runs a hand down Sakusa\u2019s cheek, down to his chest, fingers lightly brushing against his stomach, his cock, slithering down to the space between his legs. Sakusa opens them instinctively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t be fucking you.\u201d He says and Sakusa knows it\u2019s a promise. \u201cI\u2019ll be making love to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t give him a chance to say anything else.</p>\n<p>They go slow. They go really fucking slow because Atsumu hadn\u2019t done this in awhile and Sakusa hadn\u2019t done this, <em> ever. </em>But because of it, they feel everything. Every single little thing.</p>\n<p>Atsumu relearns that night what he already knew at age fifteen. Sakusa Kiyoomi was beauty embodied. Sakusa Kiyoomi was art itself.</p>\n<p>The arch in his back when Atsumu curls his fingers against that glorious spot, the veins in his neck when he throws his head back hard against the pillows, the sounds he\u2019s capable of making when he lets them tumble out of his lips unrestrained.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod,\u201d Atsumu could fucking cry, \u201cGod, Omi, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like it lasts both a second and a lifetime. Atsumu keeps his pace slow, savoring every feeling, every taste, every sound, every quiver, like a man who\u2019d found a well in a desert. He slides in and out, watches as Sakusa takes him like he\u2019s made to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He watches Sakusa unravel beneath him, completely, his legs wide open, his sex drunk eyes trained on him, clinging onto him, leaving nothing hidden.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAtsumu,\u201d </em> He moans brokenly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking come\u2026 <em> make me come.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>When he finally does, his entire body shakes, his grip on Atsumu so tight he knows it\u2019s going to leave nail marks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He comes with his name on his lips. He says it like it\u2019s holy. Like it\u2019s the only word he knows. <em> Atsumu. </em></p>\n<p>When Atsumu comes only seconds later, it\u2019s with his face buried in Sakusa\u2019s shoulder, biting down, earning a spent whimper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t know how much time passes by the time they come back down from their high, how much time passes before Atsumu starts cleaning them up, before collapsing back onto Sakusa\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>For what feels like two lifetimes, they don\u2019t move. They stay lying there, Sakusa limp under Atsumu, a lazy finger stroking circles on his back. Atsumu\u2019s face snuggled into his neck, his nose pressed against his jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Atsumu whispers, reaching out a hand to caress Sakusa\u2019s cheek the way he did all those years ago, \u201cPlease don\u2019t disappear on me in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa stays quiet.

In fact, he has flashbacks to a very similar morning from years ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He fights back the urge to throw a tantrum. He takes a deep breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks, <em> drink some fuckin\u2019 water before you start having a grand meltdown. </em></p>\n<p>He opens his bedroom door and he\u2019s greeted with the smell of something cooking.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wait. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He blinks blearily, trying to make sure this wasn\u2019t a hangover illusion of some sort, and his eyes focus on a shirtless Sakusa wearing his pink apron with cats on it, making him breakfast.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi-kun?\u201d He calls out, still suspicious that this wasn\u2019t some elaborate prank.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s shoulders tense for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They slowly relax, as he slightly turns to acknowledge him. He grunts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like your eggs runny?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh god, </em> Atsumu thinks. Oh god, he\u2019s gonna cry.</p>\n<p>Atsumu stumbles his way to him, as fast as he can without tripping, before enveloping him in a tight embrace, pressing his now wet face to Sakusa\u2019s bare back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Sakusa says, taken aback, letting go of the pan\u2019s handle to free one of his hands to hold onto Atsumu\u2019s grip around his stomach, \u201cAtsumu, don\u2019t fucking <em> cry.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Atsumu only tightens his hold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for stayin'.\u201d He says against his skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa pauses. \u201cI\u2019m still scared, just so you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.

He received enough (excess) unwanted affection from people to last a lifetime.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, <em> wow.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Ever since they\u2019d started dating, it\u2019s like he\u2019s been floating on a goddamn cloud. What was it about having Atsumu right next to him whenever he woke up in the morning that made him feel so invincible?\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Sakusa\u2019s bed is bigger so Atsumu has completely abandoned his own room in favor of disturbing him every single night. Not that he could complain.)</p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t cook for shit but he can make some mean onigiri, thanks to Osamu. He has terrible memory, but he memorizes exactly how Sakusa likes his coffee. He steals his shirts way too often, but he looks better in them anyway, so Sakusa lets him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something comforting about reaching out and knowing there\u2019s a hand you can hold anytime. There\u2019s something comforting about being able to look at him, feel the urge to kiss him, be able to do it, and not need a reason for it. He could kiss him, just because. Hold him, just because.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been tired all his life. And now, he had someone he didn\u2019t mind being tired around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Atsumu says, leaning down to talk directly into his ear, \u201cIf ya get up now\u2026 it\u2019s your turn to top tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s <em> that </em>bonus.</p>\n<p>Sakusa stands abruptly. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing just sitting there then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s smile is almost animalistic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Months ago, when all this had just started, one of the few things established was that their relationship would be kept on the downlow. Ideally, for Sakusa, it would\u2019ve just been Komori and Yachi. And for Atsumu, obviously, he\u2019d have to tell Osamu and by extension, Suna. There was also Kita, which Sakusa was hesitant about, but Atsumu was insistent because according to him, Kita is God and if he didn\u2019t hear it from him, he\u2019d find out anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa didn\u2019t even wanna get into the context of that.</p>\n<p>Atsumu also wanted to tell his parents and Sakusa had heard too much about how great they were for it to be a problem.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then, of course, there was the MSBY Black Jackals.</p>\n<p>They figured their team should probably know, considering they lived in one building and they spent more time with them than anyone else. Plus, it wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d react badly. Hell, they knew they\u2019d probably be the happiest out of everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Jackals <em> would\u2019ve </em> been included in the discussion.</p>\n<p>If they weren\u2019t known to have such big, loud mouths. (See: Bokuto Koutarou, Hinata Shoyo)</p>\n<p>So, they didn\u2019t tell them which was a mistake on their part, honestly. Because they would\u2019ve found out either way, sooner or later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that came in the form of\u2026 <em> Well. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, are ya sure?\u201d Atsumu pants, while already shimmying out of his volleyball shorts and underwear, \u201cWhat if someone walks in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have the gym to ourselves every fucking night, no one\u2019s gonna walk in.\u201d He argues, reaching behind Atsumu to massage his ass cheeks.</p>\n<p>Sakusa would come to blame Atsumu for making him feel so overly adventurous that night. There is no one else to blame for turning Sakusa\u2019s sex drive into that of a teenage boy who\u2019d gotten his first taste of a prostate orgasm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which, in a lot of ways, he kind of was.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit back.\u201d Sakusa commands, pushing Atsumu to sit down on the adjustable weight bench. \u201cAnd hold your legs open.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes a questioning noise but does what he\u2019s told, leaning against the back pad, holding himself open by the back of his thighs. \u201cIsn\u2019t it my turn to fuck you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fucking here.\u201d Sakusa scoffs.</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes an affronted noise, looking at Sakusa like he\u2019s been betrayed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, unless <em> you </em>brought lube to the gym.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face turns sour.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cFine. </em> What <em> are </em> you doing then?\u201d He asks, as Sakusa starts to sink to his knees, pressing a gentle kiss to the inside of Atsumu\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanted to do this for a while now.\u201d He explains, pressing another kiss but this time to Atsumu\u2019s puckered hole, making the boy hiss. \u201cCan I eat you out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa swears that Atsumu\u2019s pupils dilate as he sucks in a breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa is very well aware of the fact that Atsumu really, <em> really </em>liked getting his ass eaten. They\u2019ve talked about it a few times and Sakusa had been down there before, though never for long, usually just to help prepare him.</p>\n<p>Ever since he\u2019d heard about that story of Atsumu getting his ass eaten by <em> someone else </em> and getting caught, he decided he\u2019d save something special like that for a later time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And well, Sakusa thinks, softly rubbing Atsumu\u2019s entrance with his thumb, <em> here they are. </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cFuck,\u201d </em>Atsumu swears heartily, throwing his head back, his fingers digging into his thighs, \u201cYer really gonna fuckin\u2019 kill me one o\u2019 these days, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Sakusa smirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, <em> shit, </em> Omi,\u201d Atsumu breathes out, lifting his head up to look him in the eye, as he reaches down and spreads his ass cheeks readily, \u201cGet yer fuckin\u2019 tongue on me <em> now.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cPatience.\u201d Sakusa scolds, pressing his thumb down a little harder, rubbing in small circles, eyes trained on Atsumu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The breath that comes out of his half open mouth is shaky, but he keeps eye contact, and Sakusa notes the way he already looks sex drunk when he\u2019s barely gotten started.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Atsumu, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever gonna get tired of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It comes out of him before he even realizes what he\u2019s saying. Sakusa is a little shocked at himself, but Atsumu looks worse for wear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em> fully </em>blushes and that\u2019s what makes him turn his head away, as if shying from the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cShaddup, what the <em> hell.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa literally has his face planted in front of the man\u2019s asshole and still he can look him straight into the eye and say,<em> put your tongue in me, </em> but God <em> forbid </em> Sakusa genuinely compliment him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He chuckles lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 hate ya, y\u2019know that?\u201d Atsumu gasps, squirming as Sakusa continues rubbing circles against his rim, using his free hand to stroke his cock to full mast, pressing butterfly kisses to both his thighs. \u201cYou\u2019ve conditioned me. Y\u2019know how weird it is to get hard every time yer boyfriend calls ya by yer first name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t honor that with a verbal response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he ducks down and presses one last kiss to his hole, before he wraps his arms around Atsumu\u2019s thighs, and licks.</p>\n<p>Atsumu gasps, his entire body stiffening as Sakusa tries not to smile, instead, licking a little firmer, and he feels his hole clench against his tongue.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s grip on his own thighs loosen, noticing that Sakusa already has their stability covered, as shaky hands reach out to hold onto Sakusa\u2019s wrists instead, tight in a deathgrip as the man gets into a steady pace of licking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Atsumu whimpers, eyes slowly closing as he immerses himself in the feeling, \u201cFuck, yeah, like that,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think you can come like this?\u201d Sakusa asks, circling his hole with his tongue, \u201cWithout being touched?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI..\u201d Atsumu chokes, voice breaking out into a moan. He nods frantically, instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that confirmation, Sakusa wastes no time. They\u2019re in a fucking gym, after all. As hot as this all was, it wasn\u2019t a place for this to be happening. There\u2019s a vision in his head of someone next to them holding up a phone going, <em> IS THAT ALLOWED? </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa spreads Atsumu\u2019s cheeks as far as they can go, diving in and going to work. He tries long, slow licks, fast licks, he makes circles on the outside, goes up and down, before sliding inside, stiffening his tongue, and then going back out. It\u2019s almost like every single thing he does is making Atsumu go crazy.</p>\n<p>His breathing goes ragged, as if he\u2019s running a marathon, his nails digging into Sakusa\u2019s wrists so hard that he\u2019s a little scared it\u2019ll draw blood. His chest moves up and down rapidly, as if trying to keep his breaths steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi,\u201d He calls out, and it comes out as a quaky exhale, \u201cFlatten yer tongue a little\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa complies with a hum, Atsumu rubbing his wrists with his thumbs encouragingly, \u201cThen\u2026 start from the bottom \u2018n lick all the way up\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa gets the drift, doing what he\u2019s told.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cShit.\u201d </em>Atsumu swears from his chest, his back arching, head tilting back, as Sakusa keeps repeating the motion, over and over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face contorts, eyebrows scrunching up, mouth hanging open. \u201cShit, <em> fuck, </em> don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t stop staring, doesn\u2019t even wanna let himself blink as he keeps his eyes trained on Atsumu\u2019s face. His eyes stayed closed, eyebrows furrowed.</p>\n<p>He forgoes his grip on Sakusa\u2019s wrists, one hand going up to pull at his curly hair, the other holding onto the edge of the weight bench.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJus\u2019 like that, Omi, <em> please, god, </em> I\u2019m close,\u201d He slurs, his grip on the weight bench and Sakusa\u2019s hair tight, as he pushes himself against the relentless tongue, rocking his hips in rhythm with its movement like he can\u2019t help it. <em> \u201cShit, </em>I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Sakusa feels Atsumu frantically push back the curly hair on his forehead, gripping it tightly and pulling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch me come, Omi. Fuckin\u2019 watch me <em> come\u2014\u201d </em> He moans brokenly, his eyes squeezing closed, mouth opening into a silent scream.</p>\n<p>He does.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s entire body goes taut, back arching, toes curling, his hole fluttering, head pressing against the back of the weight bench. Sakusa licks him through it, Atsumu weakly pushing against his tongue, fucking himself against it, until he\u2019s so sensitive that he instinctively jerks away.</p>\n<p>His grip on Sakusa\u2019s hair weakens. He watches as Atsumu\u2019s body just sinks into the bench, his legs falling back down, like a puppet that got its strings cut off. There\u2019s come all over his stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wow. Sakusa is so fucking hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Atsumu exhales, reaching up to push his sweaty hair back. His eyes finally blink open, staring at Sakusa in disbelief. <em> \u201cFuck, </em> that felt good. We should do that more. A <em> lot </em>more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa chuckles, pressing a kiss to the inside of one of Atsumu\u2019s thighs. They\u2019re still shaking. \u201cSeemed like it. Mind doing it for me one of these days?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah, I will.\u201d Atsumu says instantly. \u201cI\u2019ll blow yer fuckin\u2019 mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa smiles, abruptly lifting one of Atsumu\u2019s legs over his shoulder, pressing one last lick against his rim, earning a surprised moan.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cJesus,\u201d </em> Atsumu winces, \u201cYou <em> know </em> I\u2019m sensitive <em> , </em>Omi, don\u2019t\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>In that moment, three different things happen.</p>\n<p>First, Sakusa is a dick, so he licks another stripe against his entrance.</p>\n<p>Two, Atsumu is sensitive but he can\u2019t help the way his hand reflexively pushes Sakusa\u2019s head closer, with a half frustrated, half horny groan.</p>\n<p>Three, the gym door slams open and Bokuto and Hinata walk in, one of them complaining about a missing hydro flask.</p>\n<p>Four different pairs of eyes meet.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a momentous silence that follows as the product of these three things.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Hinata mumbles, frozen in his spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Bokuto repeats, similarly frozen.</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t know where to hide his face that doesn\u2019t involve burying it between Atsumu\u2019s thighs so he has no choice but to stay frozen. \u201cUh.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably the worst for Atsumu who is in the worst possible position here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my fuckin\u2019 god.\u201d He buries his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna go.\u201d Hinata squeaks out, motioning to the door with his thumb, hurriedly grabbing Bokuto by the wrist, pulling urgently, \u201cRight, Bokuto-san?

If it were up to Atsumu, he\u2019d probably be parading his boyfriend around the streets, holding his hand and kissing him in restaurants, fans and press be damned. Atsumu never did care about all that. The whole reason they both came out so early in life was so they didn\u2019t <em> have </em>to do all that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy, I <em> am,\u201d </em>Atsumu presses, and it\u2019s the hundredth time he\u2019s said that tonight, as if trying to convince himself, \u201cI love him, Samu. It\u2019s almost insane how much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Osamu says. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, does he. He\u2019s been the victim of more than one late night phone call or impromptu drinking session that\u2019s spent listening to his brother rant about how sweet Sakusa Kiyoomi is behind closed doors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He also knows way more about their preferences in bed than he wished he did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu firmly believes there are certain boundaries that you do not cross with your twin, no matter how much you tell each other, and Atsumu just completely ignores those boundaries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, he just has the image of Bokuto and Hinata walking in on Sakusa Kiyoomi eating his brother\u2019s ass. It\u2019s fucking nightmare inducing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu,\u201d Atsumu sniffs sadly, interrupting his train of thought, \u201cI just don\u2019t like feelin\u2019 like a dirty secret anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>That particularly sends a sharp shot of pain through Osamu\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>All things considered, Atsumu and Sakusa were out to the fair few people who really mattered. Their team, their coach, their parents, then there was himself and Sunarin. Osamu\u2019s pretty sure there were a fair few people in the professional league who knew since the Schweiden Adlers know too, courtesy of Hinata, but not enough people to stir up any type of media frenzy.</p>\n<p>But, of course, this is Miya Atsumu we\u2019re talking about here.</p>\n<p>He overshares. He revels in being in the spotlight. He broadcasts what he eats for lunch on social media and shares shirtless mirror selfies of him in the gym. Osamu can\u2019t even imagine what\u2019s been going on in his brother\u2019s head having to hide such a big part of his life, a part that he\u2019s so proud of, from the public for the last three years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not to mention the fact that obviously, Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s parents have no fucking clue. Absolutely no clue about their relationship. Absolutely no clue that their son even likes fucking men.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu honestly thinks it\u2019s ridiculous and can\u2019t help but feel bad for Sakusa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I mean, sure, they don\u2019t get to see their son very often anymore, because he\u2019s always off training or traveling the world, being a pro volleyball player and all that. But, <em> still.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He was their son. He lived under their roof for so long. They had <em> years </em> to notice.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Sakusa in the middle of a video call with his parents. How is it that they notice Sakusa\u2019s face getting thinner in the span of a two minute call and <em> not </em> notice that their son is gay and it\u2019s been slowly killing him, hiding it from them his whole life?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is it selective vision? What the fuck is that? Osamu could see it from a mile away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even worse, Atsumu\u2019s always been the type who liked being shown off. <em> Especially </em> to parents. He\u2019s a fucking dick, but for some reason, parents always loved him. Maybe it\u2019s the being an Olympian thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu hurts for him, knowing it must be a pretty big hit to his self-esteem, being hidden away the way he\u2019s been for a while now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks that maybe Atsumu had underestimated the hardships that come along with being with someone who wasn\u2019t ready to come out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa knew this would happen, though.\u201d Osamu points out, \u201cYa knew it right from the start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> know.\u201d </em> Atsumu groans. \u201cI know\u2026 Fuck, I know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu takes one look at his twin and sighs, grudgingly throwing an arm around him, pulling him closer. \u201cC\u2019mere, ya big fuckin\u2019 idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu lets out a tiny, pathetic whine, burrowing into Osamu\u2019s shoulder. He breathes in deeply and then breathes out, as if finding comfort and security in his brother\u2019s scent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu kinda understood. His twin\u2019s been traveling around more often.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess yer a good brother sometimes.\u201d Atsumu says against his jacket, \u201cI missed ya, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the best yer ever gonna fuckin\u2019 get.\u201d Osamu grouses, pressing a quick kiss to the top of Atsumu\u2019s head, \u201cAnd just so ya know, ya need to talk to <em> him </em> if ya feel like this. Not me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I will.

He\u2019s so cute.

His dad rarely texted him. They had weekly scheduled calls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Atsumu asks, eyes not leaving the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust my dad.\u201d Sakusa answers, reaching for his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>He opens the message.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Almost instantly, his blood turns cold. His hand stiffens, his tight grip on his phone making it shake. His vision starts to go slightly blurry at the edges.</p>\n<p>Atsumu seems to sense that something\u2019s wrong because he looks up curiously, and once he catches the expression on Sakusa\u2019s face, he sits up worriedly. \u201cOmi? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to swallow. His mouth is dry. \u201cIt\u2019s a link.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyebrows furrow, before turning his gaze down to the phone screen and it\u2019s opened to an article about\u2026 <b>The Top 5 Cutest Ships In Sports!</b></p>\n<p><em> Shit, </em>Atsumu thinks, knowing where this is going.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>1. Sakusa Kiyoomi and Miya Atsumu (SakuAtsu) of The MSBY Black Jackals - Of course, no one is surprised to see these two in the #1 spot, because they were absolutely #1 in votes by a long-shot, despite not even being a real couple! (Or\u2026 are they? \ud83e\uddd0) These two aren\u2019t known for being affectionate and sweet like the others below them on this list, but rather, for their hilarious banter and undeniable chemistry on the court. These two actually live together and have been playing against each other as rivals since their high school days! No wonder they seem to bounce off each other so well! Their teammates seem to <em>love </em>teasing these two together because of it! Plus, fans always like to point out that they always look at each other like they hung the stars in the sky.

He sets it down, before taking both of Sakusa\u2019s hands in his, rubbing them to warm them up and get them to relax. \u201cOmi, yer spiraling. Ya gotta breathe.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an old mantra that Sakusa doesn\u2019t have to say to himself as often anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He focuses on his breathing, focuses on the warm hands wrapped around his own, focuses on Atsumu\u2019s voice, tries to forget about the article, tries not to think about the reason for why the hell his own dad would send him that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu?\u201d He croaks, and he doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s even saying his name.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019right here, Omi-Omi.\u201d Atsumu assures, pressing a kiss to his temple. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sakusa nods, slowly but surely coming back from the brink of a panic attack. \u201cM\u2019good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives himself a few long moments before he reaches for his phone again, bracing himself to read whatever the fuck his dad had said about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as bad as he thought it would be.</p>\n<p>It was still pretty bad. But at least it wasn\u2019t <em> \u2018Are you gay?\u2019 </em>or anything along those lines.</p>\n<p>It was simply, <em> \u201cYou should be careful about the way you act, Kiyoomi.

He closes his eyes at the feeling, almost like a cat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, ya know this can\u2019t go on forever, right?\u201d Atsumu asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa remains silent, but he opens his eyes, meeting his gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even after all these years, no matter how much better he\u2019d gotten at ignoring it and pushing it down, Atsumu could still see the fear in them.</p>\n<p>Sakusa presses their foreheads together, squeezes Atsumu\u2019s free hand. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>It scares Atsumu, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It scares him that whenever they talk about telling people the truth, Sakusa acts like it\u2019s the same as saying goodbye.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b> <em>T MINUS 1 YEAR BEFORE THE WEDDING</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The beginning of what felt like the end starts with a family dinner turned wrong.</p>\n<p>Atsumu had told his parents about him pretty early on into their relationship. It was only a few weeks in when Sakusa had overheard Atsumu on the phone with them, talking about how cute he was. Then, they\u2019d asked to speak to Sakusa and it was awkward for all of thirty seconds, until Atsumu\u2019s father had gone, \u201cKiyoomi-kun! Can I call you Kiyoomi? I heard you have freaky wrists! Can you send us a video?\u201d</p>\n<p>Safe to say, whenever they had day offs, more often than not, Sakusa wouldn\u2019t tell his own parents about them and instead would spend them in the Miya family home in Hyogo and found entertainment in watching the twins try to kill each other every few hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If not there, then he\u2019d meet up with Komori and Yachi. He\u2019d managed to minimize seeing his parents to\u2026 <em> god, </em> he doesn\u2019t even know. When <em> was </em> the last time he\u2019d actually seen his parents in person before this? But, he knew he couldn\u2019t avoid them forever and even Atsumu, who wasn\u2019t even very fond of his parents, despite never meeting them as his boyfriend, had been reminding Sakusa that he couldn\u2019t stay in hiding.</p>\n<p>He loved his parents, he<em> did. </em>Despite everything, despite the situation of having to lie about who he really is his entire life, he loved them. It\u2019s just that every single time he\u2019s forced to spend time with them, that's more than a five minute long video call, he remembers exactly why he\u2019d spent so long trying to avoid them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Kiyoomi, we\u2019ve noticed you haven\u2019t been in a relationship with anyone ever since that girl from high school,\u201d His mother starts and Sakusa thinks, <em> oh god. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd for a little while, we thought you\u2019d end up with that cute girl you befriended from university, Yachi was it, but I guess she\u2019s not someone you see yourself with romantically?\u201d And Sakusa thinks, <em> jesus christ. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably just been too busy, honey.\u201d His dad reasons, taking another bite of chicken. \u201cYou know how it is with a job like theirs. They\u2019re all over the world all the time, it\u2019s probably difficult to form a proper connection with anyone you meet, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Sakusa manages to grit out. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, we worry.\u201d His mom presses on, \u201cI just hope you aren\u2019t lonely, you know? You\u2019re twenty five now! It\u2019s around the age you start thinking about marriage and having a family. You spend so much time on volleyball and too much with your teammates. I worry about your future, when you\u2019re older and can\u2019t play sports anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d Sakusa says, forcing out a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing well. I\u2019ve been busy, but I\u2019ve been happy. Really. I\u2019m not even thinking about marriage yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t lying, to be fair. Even if they wanted to, he and Atsumu couldn\u2019t exactly get married here.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, since you have a few days off,\u201d His mom starts, putting down her fork to clasp her hands together, and Sakusa recognizes that gesture as, <em> Mom When She Is About To Say Something I Definitely Will Not Like, </em>\u201cI arranged something for you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMom.\u201d </em>Sakusa says, voice strained, his eyes hardening.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried to stop her.\u201d His dad points out, raising his hands, feigning innocence. \u201cI told you he wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d He adds, looking at his wife.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but Kiyoomi, she\u2019s such a <em> great </em>girl. And she loves watching your games! She\u2019s a fan!\u201d His mom gushes, \u201cHer parents are good friends of ours and I asked if she\u2019d want to meet you, and well,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom.\u201d Sakusa groans, burying his face in his hands. \u201cI told you not to do something like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust <em> one </em>date.\u201d His mom begs. Sakusa almost feels angry at himself for still being so weak to his parents\u2019 wishes. \u201cJust one and if you really don\u2019t like her, then I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa holds back the urge to scream. He looks up and sees that his mom is using her damn puppy dog eyes and that\u2019s <em> not </em> fair. She <em> knows </em>it\u2019s cheating.</p>\n<p>He heaves a loaded sigh. <em> Fuck. </em>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom beams and even his dad looks content with his answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he tries to finish his dinner, he thinks about how the hell he\u2019s supposed to justify this situation to Atsumu, who was understanding for the most part, but also got jealous a few months ago when he\u2019d, apparently, looked a little too cozy with Kageyama Tobio during a karaoke party. (\u201cHe\u2019s Hinata\u2019s fucking boyfriend, Atsumu, why would I <em> ever?\u201d </em> \u201cBut\u2026 <em> still.\u201d </em>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother gives him the girl\u2019s number, says her name is Yuu, and tells him to text her first.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>Sakusa Kiyoomi</b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Hi, this is Sakusa. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re Yuu? My mom told me to text you, so here it is.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Our parents arranged a blind date for us, but I need to let you know now that I\u2019m really not looking for anything and I\u2019m just going through with this to appease my parents.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Just so there\u2019s no misunderstanding here or anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Yuu</b>\n</p>\n<p>THANK GOD</p>\n<p>Hey that\u2019s rly good to know cause like i\u2019m super gay and that\u2019s why my parents rly wanted me to do this whole thing? Cause they\u2019re under the impression that I just can\u2019t meet any decent guys fuck lmao</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Sakusa audibly sighs in relief.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<b>Sakusa Kiyoomi</b>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">You have no fucking idea how good that is to hear.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Where do you wanna meet tomorrow?</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within ten minutes of being in Koito Yuu\u2019s presence, Sakusa\u2019s fallen half in love with her. He truly believes that if he had the capacity in his heart to be with women, he would choose her. That\u2019s just the kind of person she is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She\u2019s admittedly pretty, attractive in a wild, carefree way. She kind of reminded him of Atsumu.</p>\n<p>When she enters the cafe and sees him, the first thing she tells him is, <em> \u2018Damn, you\u2019re even prettier in real life! I love that for you!\u2019 </em>before promptly going into a tangent about all the shitty blind dates she\u2019s been on with not only ugly, but boring men, and how glad she is now that he\u2019s not only good looking, but also not looking to date her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d She leans forward, resting her chin in her hand, \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about myself too much. What\u2019s your reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa blinks. \u201cMy reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d She says, motioning to the air, \u201cYour reason for not wanting to do all this. Actually, aren\u2019t you a star volleyball player? Why the hell are your parents worrying about your lovelife?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa reflexively panics at the question, but then slowly realizes that he\u2019s sitting in front of a girl who\u2019s in the same boat as him. He\u2019s sitting in front of a girl who probably understands, who probably knows some of the things he\u2019s felt and gone through to some extent. Just like Atsumu. Just like Yachi. Just like Bokuto, Hinata, Osamu, and he realizes there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a similar situation.\u201d He says and hopes she gets it.</p>\n<p>She does.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d She hums, leaning back, and crossing her arms in front of her chest. \u201cHuh\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d She starts, \u201cDo you mean we\u2019re in a similar situation as in, your parents don\u2019t accept it and think you just need to meet more women?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa purses his lips. \u201cMore like my parents have no idea that I\u2019ve been in love with the same guy since I was fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuu gapes. \u201c<em> No </em>idea? At all?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa nods. \u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist.\u201d She breathes out in disbelief. \u201cSince you were <em> fifteen? </em>Shit, aren\u2019t you like, twenty five now? That\u2019s a long fucking time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa realizes it sounds bad now that he\u2019s saying it out loud. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuu bites her bottom lip, looking properly worried for him now. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa winces. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit, sorry if it\u2019s a sensitive topic.\u201d Yuu says hurriedly, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to answer me. I\u2019m just\u2026 curious. I\u2019d understand if you were still financially dependent on them. But, you\u2019re, well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA professional volleyball player who travels around the world?\u201d Sakusa finishes for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was gonna say rich, but that too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa actually laughs at that, and that makes her laugh too. All things considered, he thinks this is the best date with a girl he\u2019s ever been on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, I don\u2019t even know at this point.\u201d Sakusa sighs, leaning back against his chair. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just\u2026 scared to lose them completely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuu looks at him like she understands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d He asks, \u201cYour parents know, right? How\u2019d they take it besides pushing you into a hundred blind dates?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot great.\u201d She admits, her smile turning slightly bitter. \u201cA lot of crying, a lot of yelling, it wasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa can imagine that much. \u201cHow about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, right now, as you can see, I\u2019m going along with what they want. I\u2019m playing the part in front of them. But there\u2019s a reason for it.\u201d And the way she says it is likened to a cartoon villain as she gives Sakusa a wink.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s intrigued. \u201cWhat reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her smile is mischievous as she reaches into the pocket of her bag and fishes out her phone. After a few seconds of scrolling, she raises it up to show him the screen and he\u2019s greeted with a picture of her with another woman. They\u2019re both smiling brightly at the camera, cheeks pressed together. Sakusa can tell they\u2019re a couple.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you been together?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d She answers. \u201cBut we\u2019ve known each other since we were kids. Next door neighbors and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa softens. \u201cThat\u2019s cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was torture, actually, but I guess.\u201d She laughs, \u201cAnyway, my parents don\u2019t know about her and her parents don\u2019t know about me either. Right now, I\u2019m still working under my dad\u2019s company so I can\u2019t go against them. But I\u2019m saving up, looking for other jobs, looking for places outside this hellhole. And one day, sometime soon, when she and I are both ready, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa bites back his shock. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d She says casually, popping the \u2018p\u2019 and reaching for her coffee cup to take a sip. \u201cI mean, my parents obviously can\u2019t accept it, her parents are assholes, and so why should we put up with that? We\u2019ll save them the trouble and leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s heard all the stories, watched all the movies, but he\u2019s never met an actual person, in real life, who was willing to just\u2026 walk away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walk away from her own family, her entire life, all of it, just for the chance to start anew. Just to be who she is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of amazing, you know.\u201d He says, and he\u2019s speaking to himself more than to her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She raises her eyebrows. \u201cAmazing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying.\u201d Sakusa clarifies, eyes focused on his coffee cup, as he twists it with both hands to keep them busy. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine doing something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa isn\u2019t even looking at her, but he can tell that she smiles. \u201cYeah, you have. I\u2019m sure you have. People like us\u2026 We all have. You\u2019d just never act on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa bites the inside of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Yuu leans forward, lowers her voice when she asks, \u201cThat boy you mentioned\u2026 Is it Miya Atsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s eyes widen as he looks up at her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looks a little smug. \u201cAh. I knew it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa shouldn\u2019t even be surprised. They had fanmade ship videos on Youtube. They were the #1 couple in the sports scene, apparently.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet for a moment before she asks, \u201cWhen do you plan to tell them about him? About <em> you?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>His hands tighten around his coffee mug. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re here right now? With me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa feels a pang of guilt. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you scared he\u2019d be upset?\u201d She asks, \u201cThat you\u2019re still\u2026 having to do shit like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop.\u201d Sakusa manages to say between gritted teeth. \u201cI get your point.\u201d</p>\n<p>After letting him sit in thought for a moment, she reaches out and lays her hand on top of his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to point out anything. Nothing you don\u2019t already know.\u201d She assures and for some reason, Sakusa trusts her. \u201cI just recognize this situation all too well, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t know whether he wants to walk away or reach forward and hug her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSakusa-kun,\u201d She says his name and it flows smoothly off her tongue like she\u2019s known him all her life, \u201cSometimes, the process will be painful. And sometimes, we\u2019ll lose people who we really don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d</p>\n<p>He gulps as she squeezes his hand tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no point in living a life that isn\u2019t <em> true.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>For some reason, hearing that, Sakusa really wants to cry. But they\u2019re in a cafe in the early afternoon, so instead, he turns his palms around and takes her hands in his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He says, voice breaking slightly at the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, this is the <em> best </em>blind date I\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d Yuu\u2019s smile is sincere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa sniffs, pulling himself together. \u201cSame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuu makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m the <em> only </em>blind date you\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBitch.\u201d She laughs.</p>\n<p>Sakusa looks at her, thinks, <em> Atsumu would love her. </em> He looks at her, thinks, <em> if gay people go to hell, if people like her, like Yachi, like Atsumu, go to hell, then maybe that\u2019s exactly where he wants to be.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Omi-Omi! Back from inferno!\u201d Atsumu greets him the second he enters the door, throwing his arms around his neck, pulling his mask down, and showering kisses all over his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa groans exasperatedly, but wraps his free arm around Atsumu\u2019s waist anyway. \u201cLet me put my things away first, you big baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu peels himself off him, but not before pressing one last kiss to Sakusa\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Mom made me bring home a buncha snacks. They\u2019re all in the kitchen. She told me to tell ya she misses ya!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa can\u2019t help the smile that makes its way to his face, as he turns away to set his bag down on the floor by their couch. \u201cWas it fun? How many wins does Osamu have over you now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes a face, plopping down on the couch. \u201cY\u2019know, Omi, if ya keep takin\u2019 his side over mine, I\u2019m gonna break up with ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d Atsumu agrees easily, \u201cBut stop it! It hurts my feelings! I\u2019m supposed to be yer favorite twin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Sakusa assures, leaning down to kiss Atsumu on the forehead. \u201cMost of the time, at least. I\u2019m gonna go take a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of the\u2014\u201d Atsumu sputters after him, \u201cHey! Take that back! Say I\u2019m yer favorite twin <em> all </em>the time!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns back, raising his eyebrows. \u201cIs that even a real question? I don\u2019t let Osamu stick his cock in me, do I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, Omi.\u201d Atsumu grimaces. \u201cNever say the words \u2018Osamu\u2019 and \u2018cock\u2019 in one sentence ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, drama queen, let me take my shower.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d Atsumu exclaims, maneuvering himself into a kneeling position to meet Sakusa\u2019s gaze, resting his arms on the back of the couch, settling his chin on top of his hands. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even told me all \u2018bout yer weekend. Was it fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa pauses in the middle of removing his gloves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The realization hits him that there\u2019s something very important that he\u2019s yet to tell Atsumu and he\u2019s about 85% sure that Atsumu\u2019s not going to like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s reserving the other 15% for the fact that Yuu\u2019s a lesbian and that\u2019ll probably make it slightly better.</p>\n<p>For a moment, he wonders, does he <em> really </em>have to tell him? It\u2019s not like anything actually happened, other than the fact that he got himself a new friend. If he tells him, it\u2019ll probably just cause unnecessary drama.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then he has flashbacks to Yuu\u2019s guilt-trip, whether she meant for it to be a guilt-trip or not, and thinks about how much she reminded him of Atsumu, how much he wanted to tell Atsumu about her, even knowing he\u2019s probably going to have to spend a lot of time having to appease him and make up for the fact that he didn\u2019t tell him about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa starts, cautiously making his way closer to him, setting his gloves on the table, \u201cI, uh\u2026 I went on a blind date with a lesbian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa almost laughs. He really almost does. The look on Atsumu\u2019s face is priceless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou went on a <em> what </em> with a <em> what?\u201d </em>Atsumu stammers in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI went on a\u2026 blind date.\u201d Sakusa repeats, \u201c... with a lesbian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s eyebrows furrow, as if trying to process the information, before he slowly stands up, crossing his arms in front of his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have some fuckin\u2019 context?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Shit, here we go, </em>Sakusa braces himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s been worried about the fact that I haven\u2019t had a girlfriend since high school,\u201d Sakusa explains, eyeing Atsumu\u2019s face for any miniature change in expression, \u201cSo, she\u2026 set me up with someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a <em> lesbian?\u201d </em>Atsumu asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t <em> know </em>she\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d Sakusa clarifies, \u201cHer parents have been forcing her into blind dates because they\u2019re under the impression that she just hasn\u2019t met the right man, and\u2026 Well, weren\u2019t we lucky that it all turned out okay?\u201d He breathes out a laugh.</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t seem to find it all too funny.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, so yer tellin\u2019 me,\u201d Atsumu starts, making his way closer to Sakusa, \u201cYer mom told ya to go on a blind date, ya said yes, without even fuckin\u2019 <em> telling me, </em>by the goddamn way, and she jus\u2019 luckily turned out to be a lesbian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Well, when he puts it that way it sounds bad. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu closes his eyes and breathes out of his nose. \u201cFer fuck\u2019s sake, Omi, are ya fuckin\u2019 kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa winces. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, alright? I didn\u2019t have a choice-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d Atsumu argues, \u201cYer a grown man, you did have a choice, ya just couldn\u2019t say no to yer mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI texted her before the date, I clarified I was only doing it to appease my parents and that I wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone,\u201d Sakusa explains, hoping to make the hurt expression on Atsumu\u2019s face disappear, \u201cAnd it turned out that she\u2019s gay and has a girlfriend, and <em> nothing </em> happened, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks almost livid, his glare piercing. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about and ya know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa does know it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a while, Sakusa giving Atsumu room to breathe, the man resorting to pacing, before seemingly giving up, collapsing onto the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He bends down, hiding his face in his hands, before frustratedly running them through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYer too much for me.\u201d He mumbles, taking a steadying breath, \u201cYer too fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa bites the insides of his mouth, making his way over to the couch, sitting beside him but keeping a reasonable distance in case it would make Atsumu angrier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sakusa repeats, and he means it. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He listens to Atsumu breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few more minutes, he starts talking, sounding a lot calmer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you so much, y\u2019know that?\u201d Atsumu says and his voice is shaking. \u201cSo goddamn much. Sometimes, I think about how much and it scares the shit out of me. I can\u2019t imagine my fuckin\u2019 life without ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa feels like someone had just run a lawnmower over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe things that yer goin\u2019 through, yer situation with yer parents, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever fully understand, no matter how much I want to. I wish I could take yer pain away, I wish I could shoulder at least half of it, and I\u2019m <em> sorry. </em> I\u2019m sorry that ya feel like ya have to go on fuckin\u2019 blind dates with women to keep \u2018em in yer life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu finally looks up at him and his eyes are glassy. \u201cBut, y\u2019know, it\u2019s really hard havin\u2019 to be kept a secret, havin\u2019 to tone down something that I\u2019ve been taught to embrace, havin\u2019 to always go out into the world and act like you <em> aren\u2019t </em> the love of my life,\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa isn\u2019t able to fight the urge to reach out, taking Atsumu\u2019s hands in his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lets him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still an attention seeking, validation seeking, self-absorbed sunovabitch at the end of the day, Omi,\u201d Atsumu sniffs, managing to push out a small smile, \u201cBut I\u2019m doin\u2019 it all because I <em> said </em> I would, because I\u2019m waitin\u2019 for ya to be <em> ready, </em>because I fuckin\u2019 love ya so goddamn much, ya hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa nods, scared that if he opens his mouth, he\u2019ll blurt out something way too honest, like, <em>you're the love of my goddamn life</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, throw me a fuckin\u2019 bone here, alright? And promise me ya won\u2019t say yes to any more blind dates, lesbian or not.\u201d He sniffs, his expression turning into a glare, \u201cAnd stop just <em> starin\u2019 </em> at me like that \u2018n hold me and tell me ya love me when I\u2019m <em> crying, </em> ya useless boyfriend.\u201d His voice breaking into a sob.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sakusa breathes out, finally, gathering Atsumu in his arms and burying his face in his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets Atsumu cry for a little while, rocking them back and forth, silently pressing kisses everywhere he can reach. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll do better.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Atsumu grumbles, lifting his head up slightly, \u201cTell me about the lesbian. Was she cool? All the lesbians I know are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa holds him as he tells Atsumu about Yuu, keeps his eyes on him, taking in this man who\u2019s shown so many times that he loved him wholeheartedly and unconditionally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And he realizes something for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only ever really thought about things from his own point of view, about how worth it was to abandon everything he was raised to believe in, to let himself fall in love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He always thought about all the things he\u2019d have to give up, have to sacrifice, have to face, eventually, the past three years spent convincing himself that Atsumu would be worth the pain.</p>\n<p>He always thought about how one day, inevitably, terrifyingly, he\u2019d have to change how he\u2019s been living his whole life to be with Atsumu.</p>\n<p>He was so absorbed in his own struggle, without realizing that the past three years, Atsumu\u2019s already been doing just that.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b> <em>T MINUS 10 MONTHS BEFORE THE WEDDING</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t know how exactly he ends up faded in Bokuto and Hinata\u2019s apartment with some of his fellow Olympians but he knows that he\u2019s having a good time.</p>\n<p>Trust Bokuto Koutarou to go crazy with his birthday.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t even his only birthday celebration. This was apparently his second one. The first one was held in a fancy bar two nights ago and it involved way more money, way more booze, and way more people. Atsumu had gone and tried to drag him along but Sakusa had answered with, \u2018I\u2019d rather shoot myself.\u2019\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was worth it, though. Atsumu had come home earlier than expected, drunk and horny as he always is when he drinks too much, and the night had ended with him sitting on Sakusa\u2019s face and coming all over their headboard, twice.</p>\n<p>It was a good night.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Kuroo and Kenma finally hooked up and Bokuto had cried telling them about it, with all the pride of a supportive father. Sakusa had no idea what he was going on about, really, but good for them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Wakatoshi,\u201d Sakusa says but it comes out as a garble, \u201cThose cookies had weed, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Ushijima turns to him, his eyes are bloodshot. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d He swears. \u201cI ate two. No wonder I feel like a feather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em> fiiiiine.\u201d </em> Atsumu says from beside him, waving a hand flippantly. \u201cThese ones aren\u2019t that strong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori starts giggling from his position on the floor. \u201cHehe. Sakusa did <em> drugs.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>He gives his cousin a pointed look. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mean, Omi,\u201d Atsumu gives him a dopey smile, before draping his arms around his cousin, \u201cI love this guy. He told me all \u2018bout how ya wanted to fuck me silly when we were sixteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa merely grunts, closing his eyes peacefully. \u201cStop talking. I\u2019d fight both of you if I didn\u2019t feel so fucking good right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Atsumu hums and it sounds dangerous, \u201cYa look awfully pliant tonight, Omi-Omi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa feels fingers start running over his thigh and he sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Komori deadpans and Sakusa imagines that he\u2019s looking away, \u201cRight in front of my salad. Literally.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He motions towards the plate of salad on his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell did Bokkun even serve salad?\u201d Atsumu asks, leaning his head on Sakusa\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re athletes, Atsumu.\u201d Aran retorts, appearing from the kitchen. \u201cWe have to eat healthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re eating space cookies, Aran-kun, I hardly count that as healthy living.\u201d Atsumu shoots back, \u201cAnd I hate that <em> yer </em>here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aran answers with him a shrug of his shoulders. \u201cBetter me than Sunarin, don\u2019t ya think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu thinks about it for a second. \u201cYer right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu, baby, look at them,\u201d Sakusa says slapping him on the arm and Atsumu has to bite back a smile at the pet name.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa barely ever called him that outside the bedroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen. If I need to think of something to bring a boner down, I\u2019ll think of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bokuto, Hinata, and Hoshiumi seem to be doing a rendition of Super Trouper by ABBA. He doesn\u2019t know when the hell they\u2019d put on the colorful scarves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Are those Bokuto\u2019s? What the <em> fuck. </em>Now, he wants one.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Omi, when ya watched Mamma Mia for the first time, did ya ever wanna be part of Donna and The Dynamos?\u201d Atsumu asks, \u201cI remember Samu and I jumpin\u2019 on the bed jammin\u2019 to Dancing Queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, but I do know that I had a fat crush on Christine Baranski and thought she was my miracle ticket to a life of heterosexuality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Atsumu breathes out. \u201cYer my soulmate. Never leave me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The song switches to Honey Honey and the space cookies have taken full effect on everyone. Kageyama Tobio had a hat with a feather on top of his head, and Akaashi Keiji was filming his boyfriend with one hand while waving a balloon animal with the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Wait, when the hell did Ushijima learn how to make balloon animals and what situation led to that?)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s around the time Gimme Gimme Gimme starts playing that time and space cease to exist and turn into a mere illusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aran is shirtless, Komori is dead, Ushijima is on the phone with Tendou (Who\u2019s in fuckin\u2019 Paris, bless his phone bill.), Hoshiumi is <em> still </em>singing at the top of his lungs, Hyakuzawa passed out with his head on the toilet seat, Bokuto and Akaashi have the munchies and are eating hot cheetos, and Kageyama and Hinata\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Atsumu exhales, eyes trained on the two.</p>\n<p>Hinata had the man caged between his thighs, which Kageyama seemed to be appreciating, as he ran his hands over them, groping and squeezing. They were fully <em> devouring </em>each other on the couch, like it was no one\u2019s business, right in front of everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which it was actually kind of no one\u2019s business, because nobody was really looking at them, save for him and\u2026</p>\n<p>He turns his head and Sakusa looked just as affected as him, staring at the two with a very familiar haze in his eyes, one that Atsumu recognizes well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leans into his ear, whispers, \u201cIs it turnin\u2019 ya on too, Omi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Sakusa groans weakly, squirming in his seat, \u201cWhat the <em> hell.\u201d </em>He complains, as if in disbelief that he\u2019s getting hard over Hinata Shoyo and Kageyama Tobio.</p>\n<p>Atsumu couldn\u2019t say he shared that same disbelief. He\u2019s always found the pair attractive. Even before they buffed up. His high school self was really onto something.</p>\n<p>He feels his cock steadily rising as Hinata starts grinding down against his boyfriend\u2019s crotch and that\u2019s the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, as he turns to Sakusa, \u201cYa think the others\u2019d mind if I jus\u2019 fuckin\u2019 took my dick out right now \u2018n started stroking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly? No.\u201d Sakusa answers and Atsumu notices the obvious bulge in his pants matching his own, \u201cBut I won\u2019t let you. If you\u2019ve forgotten, our apartment is just one floor up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw,\u201d Atsumu playfully whines, \u201cThought we could watch \u2018em and ya\u2019d take me right here in front of everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m high and have been convinced to do some risky shit here and there, but there are lines I will not cross, even for you. And my <em> cousin </em> is right there, what the <em> fuck.\u201d </em> Sakusa grouses, meeting Atsumu\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYer cousin\u2019s asleep though\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re cut off by a particularly loud moan from Hinata.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s face contorts like he\u2019s being tortured, his eyebrows pinched. \u201cLet\u2019s fucking go, <em> now.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>As they leave the apartment hand in hand in a hurry, the others say goodbye with half dead cheers and wolf whistles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The end comes in the form of Sakusa waking up to a still unconscious Atsumu, the blinding light of the sun peaking through the blinds, and an onslaught of messages and missed calls.</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s first thought is, <em> oh god what did I do last night. </em> His second thought is, <em> oh god what did Atsumu do last night. </em> His third thought is, <em> oh god is Komori dead. </em></p>\n<p>The first text thread he opens is Komori\u2019s, so that cancels out his third thought.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Komori Motoya</b>\n</p>\n<p>Hey, u awake?

The next text threads are from the other Jackals, Meian, Inunaki, Oliver, Adriah, Bokuto. There were some from the others who were with them last night, like Akaashi and Kageyama.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bokuto Koutarou</b>\n</p>\n<p>Holy shit Omi-kun I\u2019m so sorry</p>\n<p>None of us meant to do that</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t even think about it. I\u2019m so sorry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu sits up, eyebrows furrowed at the sight of the notifications on Sakusa\u2019s phone, before reaching for his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He makes a confused noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu and my \u2018rents called me a few times\u2026 Aran, Suna, Kita, Bokuto\u2026 What the fuck\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa finally sees what he\u2019s searching for. It\u2019s a link to an article.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<b> <em>SAKUATSU FINALLY CONFIRMED?</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After years and years of theories and speculation, it looks like our favorite unconfirmed volleyball couple, Miya Atsumu and Sakusa Kiyoomi of The MSBY Black Jackals were caught in the middle of what seemed to be a loving (and steamy) liplock!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that Bokuto Koutarou of the MSBY Black Jackals celebrated his 26th birthday last September 20 and had more than one celebration! (Not surprising for someone who\u2019s known to be a social butterfly.) His first celebration that was held in B.A.D. made some headlines due to all the familiar faces seen attending the party. (Who knew Bokuto was acquainted with famous Youtuber, Worldwide Kodzuken?)</p>\n<p>But it seems his second celebration from the night before has started a media frenzy! Scattered throughout the night, several Instagram stories had been posted on more than one social media account (Hmm\u2026 it must\u2019ve been the alcohol. We\u2019re looking at you, Bokuto, Hinata, and Hoshiumi.), exposing a lot of our beloved Olympians in the middle of some very\u2026 risque situations. We could go on and on about the Mamma Mia dance party, the questionable hat choices, and the glimpse we got of one of our favorite confirmed couples, Kageyama Tobio of the Schweiden Adlers and Hinata Shoyo of the MSBY Black Jackals, getting steamy on the couch!</p>\n<p>But today\u2019s headline is focused on what seems to be a confirmation of a romance between who fans lovingly call, SakuAtsu. In the background of several of these Instagram stories, you catch glimpses of the two all over each other, hand-holding, thigh touching, leaning against each other\u2019s shoulders, even kissing, you name it!</p>\n<p>There may not have been any verbal confirmation but if you\u2019ve seen those clips, I think anyone would agree that it\u2019s a confirmation in itself. If you haven\u2019t, here\u2019s a fanmade clip compilation very cleverly named, <em> SakuAtsu Making Everyone Feel Single In The Background Of Instagram Stories For 4 Minutes. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It scares Atsumu that Sakusa doesn\u2019t even look panicked. He doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s spiraling. He doesn\u2019t look scared. The fear in his eyes that Atsumu had gotten so acquainted with, just <em> gone.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t look scared. He just looked defeated.</p>\n<p>When he looks up to meet Atsumu\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s as if he were saying, <em> it\u2019s over. </em></p>\n<p>The very last text thread Sakusa opens is from his mother and it\u2019s nothing but a curt,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Kiyoomi, we need to talk. We\u2019ll be at your apartment in a few hours. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi?\u201d Atsumu manages to say, resting a hand on the small of his back. \u201cYa good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s supposed to react. He\u2019s not even sure how he feels. It\u2019s almost like it just isn\u2019t sinking in. He\u2019d known something like this would happen, eventually. But now that the moment\u2019s here, he only feels like doing one thing.</p>\n<p>He laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He laughs so hard that tears form in the corners of his eyes and Atsumu\u2019s looking at him like he\u2019s completely lost it. Maybe he has.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d He swears at the hilarity of it all, wiping away his stray tears, \u201cHey, Atsumu. You ready for meet the parents?\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If asked to repeat what exactly his parents had said that day, he couldn\u2019t tell you for the life of him. He heard once that when something hurts you so deeply, you tend to forget about it, your brain subconsciously making you bury the memory as deep as you possibly can for the sake of survival.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa isn\u2019t sure how much of that is true, but he assumes that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, to be fair, he zoned out for most of it. The second his parents had stepped into the apartment looking damn near livid, Sakusa had to bite back a laugh. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop finding the entire situation to be comedic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anything, Atsumu seemed to be the one who was freaking out for him, sitting as close to him as possible without actually touching him. Probably for the purpose of keeping Sakusa\u2019s parents from being even angrier but staying close enough to comfort him or be there in case things get violent.</p>\n<p>So, he doesn\u2019t really remember the first part. His brain only starts catching up in the middle of his dad saying <em> \u201cI told you that if you were going to be roommates with him, you\u2019d have to be careful because he could be a bad influence\u2014\u201d </em>and that\u2019s what snaps him out of his trance.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about him like that.\u201d Sakusa says, voice low, but firm. \u201cYou can say whatever you want about me but leave Atsumu out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sees the shock in his parents\u2019 eyes. He realizes he\u2019s never talked back to them. Ever.</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks taken aback too, but there\u2019s a hint of affection in his eyes as he subtly reaches out and squeezes Sakusa\u2019s hand clutching onto the edge of the couch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi,\u201d His mother says, and she sounds like she\u2019s begging him for something, \u201cWe\u2019re <em> worried </em> about you. The path you\u2019re choosing to take is a tough one and a <em> wrong </em> one and we just want to help\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Sakusa doesn\u2019t hold back his laughter. <em> The path he\u2019s choosing. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThe path I\u2019m choosing?\u201d He repeats, feeling hysterical. \u201cYou think I <em> chose </em> this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi.\u201d His dad says sternly. \u201cListen to what your mother is saying. We just want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <em> you </em> listen.\u201d Sakusa hisses between gritted teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole life listening to you, so it\u2019s your turn to listen to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve known I was gay since I was fifteen. Did you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad closes his mouth, eyes widening.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cFifteen. </em> Think about that. And you had no clue. You had no clue that I\u2019ve spent so much of my life trying to mold myself into someone I just wasn\u2019t, making myself miserable, making every decision I made in life, never for myself, but for <em> you, </em>so that I could be a good son. Because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s squeezing his hand tighter and Sakusa realizes he\u2019s practically yelling but he can\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t have chosen this.\u201d He continues, because if he stops now, he\u2019ll never get it out. \u201cI need you to know that. If I could\u2019ve chosen, it wouldn\u2019t have been this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi, if you would just come with us\u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> tried.\u201d </em> He asserts, closing his eyes, grounding himself. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I did, I <em> tried. </em>All my life. I\u2019ve been so tired\u2026 all my life.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks up at them, looks his parents in the eye when he says, \u201cBut this is me. No matter how much I tried not to be, it\u2019s<em> me. </em> And if you can\u2019t accept that, then\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa tells himself, <em> say it. Tell them. Tell them that if they can\u2019t accept you, then leave. Tell them if they can\u2019t love you as you are, then they can get out of your life. Tell them you\u2019ll be fine without them. Tell them. Open your fucking mouth, Sakusa Kiyoomi. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t accept me,\u201d He says, inhales, exhales, \u201c... then <em> leave.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s the longest silence Sakusa had ever felt in his life. It was an entire lifetime, with Atsumu\u2019s hand in his, and the parents he\u2019d loved so much for so long, staring at him like they didn\u2019t recognize him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hell, Sakusa couldn\u2019t blame them. In the end, they never really did know him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks back to what Yuu told him that afternoon in the cafe.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sakusa-kun, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi,\u201d His dad sighs, gently holding his mother by her arm, \u201cOnce you\u2019ve gotten your head straight, give us a call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sometimes, the process will be painful. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Sakusa watches them walk towards the door, his mother giving him one last look, saying, \u201cWe love you, Kiyoomi. We just want you to be on the right path.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> And sometimes, we\u2019ll lose people who we really don\u2019t want to lose. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next time you decide to speak to us, make sure it\u2019s when you\u2019re ready to get help. Otherwise\u2026\u201d His dad drifts off, shaking his head, before opening the door. \u201cMake the right choice, son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> But there\u2019s no point in living a life that isn\u2019t true. </em>\n</p>\n<p>The door closes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only then that Sakusa\u2019s knees buckle and Atsumu\u2019s hands are on him before they touch the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi?\u201d Atsumu\u2019s voice sounds distant but Sakusa can vaguely feel hands on his skin. They\u2019re shaking so badly. Was that Atsumu or him?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmi, are you okay? Omi? Are ya with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know anything. He doesn\u2019t know about anything at all.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Atsumu knows it\u2019s coming so when it does, he\u2019s ready.</p>\n<p>After Sakusa\u2019s parents walk out their front door, an eerie quiet comes over the apartment, one that doesn\u2019t go away. Minutes pass, hours, days, weeks. It turns into an emptiness that seeps into everything they do and everywhere they go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They play as well as they always do, their work, their volleyball, always kept separate from whatever the hell else was going on in their lives. But it was the only thing they had left. The only thing holding them together.</p>\n<p>Volleyball.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like all those years ago.</p>\n<p>It takes three weeks for it to come and Atsumu knew it was coming, waiting like an idiot, only because he didn\u2019t have the heart to do it himself.</p>\n<p>That damned morning three weeks ago, he\u2019d rubbed Sakusa\u2019s back as he threw up everything he ate the night before. That day, he\u2019d done all the chores, cooked, cleaned, the way Sakusa always did, making sure he ate, despite being close to catatonic. That night, he held him to sleep even if he wouldn\u2019t hold him back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he did that every night after.</p>\n<p>Three weeks. Sakusa\u2019s parents don\u2019t call him, don\u2019t text him, don\u2019t try to visit them. Honestly, Atsumu half expects them to start bombarding <em> his </em> phone, blaming him for their son being gay, but they don\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three weeks of concerned calls and texts from his parents, from Osamu, from Suna. All of which he replied with nothing but variations of, <em> I\u2019ll talk to you soon. Not now.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Three weeks. They haven\u2019t kissed in three weeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu knows it\u2019s coming, knows Sakusa\u2019s probably been waiting for when they\u2019d have a break coming before bringing it up, so when he hears it, he\u2019s ready.</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu,\u201d Sakusa starts, standing in front of him with his hands clenched into fists at his side, \u201cI think we need to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBreak up?\u201d Atsumu finishes his sentence without blinking.</p>\n<p>Sakusa closes his mouth. He doesn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre ya tryin\u2019 to run away again, Omi?\u201d Atsumu asks, tells himself that he can\u2019t cry. He can\u2019t be the one to cry right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu\u2026 I <em> can\u2019t </em>do this.\u201d Sakusa says and he sounds so empty, like he\u2019s used up all of himself just to be able to stand in front of him right now. \u201cIt\u2019s all too much for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu wills his voice not to quiver as he asks, \u201cYa don\u2019t think it is for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sees Sakusa\u2019s nails dig into his palms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath, tells himself the same mantra Sakusa has been using his whole life, realizing for the first time how exactly he feels whenever he uses it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, Omi,\u201d Atsumu starts, making his way closer to him, taking Sakusa\u2019s hands in his, urging him to stop hurting himself, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I ever really had ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look on Sakusa\u2019s face is anguished.</p>\n<p>\u201cI only ever had half of ya, y\u2019know? \u2018Cause you were too scared to ever give me all of ya\u2026 and that was okay.\u201d He says, looking him in the eye, so he knows he means it. \u201c\u2018Cause I love ya with all of me, Omi. <em> All </em>of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sees the exact moment that Sakusa cracks, because his chin wobbles for a moment, blink and you miss it, but it was there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d Atsumu says without a hint of doubt or hesitation. <em> \u201cAnything.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s hands seem to try and close in on themselves but Atsumu doesn\u2019t let them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if ya really believe that this is what ya need right now, then I\u2019ll let ya break me, Omi.\u201d He says, pressing their foreheads together, \u201cI\u2019ll let ya break me to fuckin\u2019 pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa opens his mouth, breath shaky, \u201cPlease,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you listen to me,\u201d Atsumu says, voice suddenly turning assertive, no matter how shaky it is, \u201cI\u2019ll let ya break up with me. But I\u2019m not gonna let ya move out. I\u2019m not gonna let ya run away. Because y\u2019know what, Omi? I know you love me. Even if I dunno \u2018bout anythin\u2019 else, I know that much. No matter how much ya wanna run, we\u2019ve been in love with each other our whole lives and there\u2019s no runnin\u2019 from that. Yer stupid in love with me and <em> you </em> know it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks like he\u2019s about to crumble. \u201cAtsumu, <em> stop\u2014\u201c </em></p>\n<p>\u201cSince we were teenagers, Omi,\u201d Atsumu breathes out, \u201cYou love me, you break me, and you run away. So, y\u2019know what? This time, I\u2019m not gonna make it easy. Yer gonna stay right here, yer gonna see the damage you\u2019ve inflicted, and yer gonna <em> watch </em>me break.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa closes his eyes and Atsumu knows he\u2019s hurting. He knows it\u2019s hurting him and he thinks, <em> good.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Feel it. Realize what the hell you need to do next. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> tired </em> of cryin\u2019 for you all alone, Omi. So, once ya figure yerself out, ya better fuckin\u2019 apologize to me.\u201d Atsumu says, finally pulling away, and for someone who\u2019d just had his heart shattered to pieces, he sounds like he\u2019s won.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of cryin\u2019 for you. You cry for me, this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu turns around, picks up his gym bag, and walks out their door, leaving it slightly open for Sakusa to follow. \u201cThe gym is free. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Sakusa gets it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu isn\u2019t saying goodbye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he refuses to let Sakusa be a coward, and takes matters into his own hands, saying, <em>this is the last time</em> <em>I\u2019m leaving my door open for you.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> What are you going to do?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>__</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only at night, back in the room that felt more like his three years ago, lying in a bed that now felt so unfamiliar, that Atsumu finally allows himself to break.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s two in the morning, but he reaches for his phone, looks for Osamu\u2019s contact, and presses the call button.</p>\n<p>He picks up after one ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu?\u201d His voice crackles through the phone, and he didn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d been asleep at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot \u2018ew\u2019 tonight, huh?\u201d Atsumu jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know ya know how to be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Osamu says gently, \u201cIt\u2019s jus\u2019 me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It starts out slow, and then all at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His breathing gets shallow, his chest tightens, he gasps for air, and he feels like someone rips his heart out of his throat when his exhale turns into a sob.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once it starts, it doesn\u2019t stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does the only thing he knows to do when he feels like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cries to his brother, holding on tightly to his phone with both hands as if it were Osamu, and he just breaks down completely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It goes on for so long that he starts to worry about the state of his throat. He wonders if the man in the next room can hear him.</p>\n<p>He hopes he can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu,\u201d Atsumu says pathetically in between bouts of wailing, <em> \u201cFuck, </em>this hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries to hide it but Atsumu\u2019s pretty sure he can hear Osamu sniffling on the other end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYa have a break comin\u2019 up?\u201d Osamu asks and Atsumu can hear noises in the background, as if he were rummaging around.</p>\n<p>\u201cStartin\u2019 tomorrow.\u201d Atsumu manages to say but it still comes out as a sob, \u201cYa gonna come see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pickin\u2019 ya up in a few. Get ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu will never say it out loud but Osamu\u2019s the best part of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He instantly kicks his blanket off, scrambling out of bed. \u201cWell, hurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost three am by the time Osamu\u2019s in front of the Jackals complex. When Atsumu enters the car looking like someone had just died, Osamu doesn\u2019t say anything. He just starts driving.</p>\n<p>During the day, it\u2019s always hard to appreciate long winding roads and scenery. The city was always filled with noise and traffic. Osamu only ever learned to appreciate driving, the first time he did this a few months ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just got out of his apartment past midnight and went.</p>\n<p>There was something calming about it. Something that made him feel peaceful by the time he got back home as the sun rose.</p>\n<p>He turns to his brother.</p>\n<p>Atsumu continues to snivel and whimper pathetically beside him, his head leaning against the car window. It\u2019s only half an hour later that he gets curious, sitting up.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d He sniffs, \u201cWhere are we goin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu shrugs. \u201cI dunno yet. Jus\u2019 wanted to drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu says nothing, only making himself comfortable, kicking one foot up on the dashboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu, get yer dirty ass foot off my fuckin\u2019 dashboard or so help me god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYer so anal, ya\u2019d let Sunarin do it all the time.\u201d Atsumu whines, \u201cC\u2019mon be nicer to yer big brother who just went through a shitty breakup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, how about <em> you </em> be fuckin\u2019 nicer to yer little brother who just went through a shitty breakup.\u201d Osamu shoots back.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s blood runs cold. His head swivels to look at his twin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the fuck did that happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu squirms uncomfortably, taking a left turn. \u201cA few months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few mo\u2014\u201c Atsumu chokes on his own spit, \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t ya tell me? What\u2019s <em> wrong </em>with ya?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu\u2019s hands tighten around the steering wheel. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy, Tsumu. So have I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Atsumu exclaims, \u201cWe tell each other everything! You and Sunarin have been dating since fuckin\u2019 <em> high school. </em>Why the fuck wouldn\u2019t ya tell me somethin\u2019 like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause if I talked to you, I knew I\u2019d fuckin\u2019 have a breakdown, that\u2019s why.\u201d Osamu spits out, \u201cBut now you \u2018n yer Omi are a mess and hearin\u2019 you cry was makin\u2019 <em> me </em>cry, so here we fuckin\u2019 are, I guess!\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu examines the expression on Osamu\u2019s face and sees that his eyes looked swollen too. He thinks back to all the phone calls they\u2019d had the past few months, thinks about how he always assumed that Osamu just sounded tired because of work. He was so absorbed in his own drama that he didn\u2019t even realize that Osamu had stopped mentioning Suna.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck. He feels terrible. Has their twin thing weakened with age or something?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu. Pull over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu makes a face. <em> \u201cWhat?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard me. Pull the fuck over.\u201d</p>\n<p>After driving a little more, Osamu does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He faces Atsumu. \u201cWhat the fuck d\u2019ya want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to <em> talk </em>to me.\u201d Atsumu says, turning in his seat to face his brother fully. \u201cWhat the hell happened with Sunarin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu seems to mull something over in his head before taking a deep breath and giving up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe fell outta love with me. That\u2019s all it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow.\u201d Atsumu blinks and then takes out his phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuckin\u2019 kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck\u2014\u201c Osamu grabs Atsumu\u2019s wrist, because the fucker actually starts scrolling for Suna\u2019s contact. \u201cTsumu, calm the fuck down, will ya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean, fallin\u2019 outta love with ya? After nearly a fuckin\u2019 <em> decade? </em> I\u2019ll kill \u2018im, Samu. Say the word and I will.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Osamu\u2019s grip on his brother\u2019s wrist tightens because he can tell that he\u2019s being sincere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He huffs out a ghost of a laugh, pulling him in for a hug. \u201cYer so fuckin\u2019 stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s frozen stiff for a moment, shocked over the rare occurrence of Osamu initiating affection, but relaxes into the hug easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raises a hand to pat his head. \u201cThis better not be to change the topic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame \u2018im, Tsumu.\u201d Osamu says against his shoulder, \u201cS\u2019not like the break up was all his fault. It jus\u2019 wasn\u2019t workin\u2019 anymore, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu can hear how hard he\u2019s trying not to cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m busy with the shop, he\u2019s always everywhere playin\u2019 games\u2026\u201d He continues, his exhale coming out as a shudder, \u201cWe tried to make it work but it wasn\u2019t workin\u2019 anymore\u2026 I could see \u2018im gettin\u2019 tired of me and I felt myself feelin\u2019 the same. We started fightin' all the time. It was miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu\u2026\u201d Atsumu sighs, his arms around him tightening. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t ya tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu sniffs. \u201cFelt pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s even <em> more </em> reason to tell me.\u201d Atsumu retorts. \u201cDon\u2019t hide shit like that from me ever again or I\u2019ll kick yer ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu begins to pull away from him, but Osamu makes a whiny sound, burrowing closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYer fuckin\u2019 cryin\u2019, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d Atsumu teases, \u201cYa big crybaby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut yer trap, ya were sobbin\u2019 to me on the phone just an hour ago.\u201d Osamu shoots back, \u201c\u2018Sides\u2026 how\u2019re ya feelin\u2019? What exactly happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu guesses they\u2019re having this whole conversation while wrapped in a hug. He assumes Osamu\u2019s too embarrassed to show himself crying, so he\u2019ll let it go without making fun of him for now.</p>\n<p>He probably owes Osamu for those months of being a bad brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter his parents found out \u2018n basically told him it\u2019s either be straight or nothin\u2019, he lost it \u2018n tried to break up with me.\u201d Atsumu explains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I kill \u2018im?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu snorts. \u201cNah. I already did what I had to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I get where he\u2019s comin\u2019 from,\u201d Osamu says, \u201cBut he\u2019s gotta know he can\u2019t live his life like this, right? There\u2019s gotta be a line somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Atsumu sighs, groaning and burying his face in Osamu\u2019s hoodie, \u201cSamu, tell me I did the right thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what the hell ya did,\u201d Osamu chuckles and it sounds wet, \u201cBut I think I kinda do. Ya did the right thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, Atsumu genuinely takes comfort in hearing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we not done huggin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGimme a minute.\u201d He says, \u201cJust another minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu lets him cry. He deserves to.</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhat?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI love ya, okay?\u201d He assures. \u201cM\u2019sorry for not noticing. I\u2019ll make it up to ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels his brother bury his face deeper into his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTsumu?\u201d He croaks weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake it work with Omi-kun.\u201d He says, \u201cI need to give \u2018im a good talkin\u2019 to\u2026 but I like how ya are with him. Once he makes ya stop cryin\u2019 all the time, it\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 workin\u2019 on it.\u201d Atsumu huffs. \u201cI said I love ya. Say it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu, yer literally cryin\u2019 on me like a baby right now, what pride are ya tryin\u2019 to protect here?\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love ya, Tsumu.\u201d He mumbles. \u201cI love ya the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels tears prickle at the back of his eyes again. He hides his face in Osamu\u2019s shoulder with a quivery <em> \u2018Damn you, Samu.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Komori and Yachi can do nothing as they watch Sakusa Kiyoomi crumble. He does not cry. He does not yell. But he drinks.</p>\n<p>Oh, does he drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere do you think he went?\u201d Sakusa garbles, cheek pressed against the table. \u201cHe told me he wouldn\u2019t let me move out \u2018cause he wanted me to see him suffer\u2026 and then he <em> left.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cDude, all his stuff are still here,\u201d Komori reassures tiredly, patting Sakusa\u2019s back, \u201cI don\u2019t think he moved out. You have, like, a week off or something, don\u2019t you? He\u2019s probably back in Hyogo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be drinking yourself to death like this, Sakusa.\u201d Yachi says in a motherly tone, \u201cIf anything, you need to spend this time clearing your head. Deciding what your next move is gonna be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou broke up with him.\u201d Komori deadpans.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, <em> he </em>broke up with me, were you listening to me at all?\u201d Sakusa complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause <em> you </em>were trying to break up with him! And he knew it! Don\u2019t you realize how sad it is that the man was just waiting for you to do it!\u201d Komori explains. \u201cHonestly, man, I love you and I get why you\u2019ve been acting the way you have all these fucking years, but you can\u2019t live the rest of your life like this. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa turns away, burying his face in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I want to be like this. I don\u2019t <em> want </em>any of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen <em> why </em> are you doing it?\u201d Komori asks and he sounds just as frustrated as Sakusa feels.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause!\u201d Sakusa starts, anxiously pulling his gloves up, like a nervous tic, \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know, okay? I don\u2019t know. I just didn\u2019t know what the hell else to do. I was spiraling and my fucking parents were about to leave me in the dust and I hated the fact that Atsumu was seeing it all happen, and\u2026 shit, I don\u2019t know, okay?\u201d He finishes lamely, thumping his head against the wooden table beneath him, \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Komori sighs like he\u2019s tired of it all, and Sakusa thinks, <em> felt.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo, tell me what exactly your plan was gonna be after breaking up with Atsumu\u2026 Were you gonna go back to your parents and tell them you\u2019ll try to be straight or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi gives Komori a look. \u201cBe <em> nice.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen to <em> nice.\u201d </em> Komori bites back. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying that all these years, and he never fucking listens. So, he\u2019s gonna get the tough love he deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa finally looks up at this, blinking at his cousin with half dead eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that if you break up with Atsumu, you\u2019re somehow saving him from a hard, miserable life with you? Do you think that if you break up with him, and are single again, you\u2019ll somehow appease your parents and you can go back to the way things were like nothing happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yachi winces at the side, having no choice but to watch it all unfold.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, tough luck, buddy, because that\u2019s not how that works.\u201d Komori presses. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s not gonna be Atsumu, it\u2019s gonna be somebody else. And guess what, Omi, he\u2019s <em> still </em> gonna be a man.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Sakusa swallows, his tongue feels like sandpaper.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I have a strong feeling in my gut that if you let Atsumu go, you\u2019re gonna spend the rest of your life regretting the fact that you let go of the person you\u2019ve been half in love with since you were fifteen, when he gave you a fucking choice to <em> stay.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa wants to yell, he wants to throw a goddamn tantrum, he wants to throw things, and cry, and tell Komori that he doesn\u2019t know the first thing about what it feels like to be gay and have the parents that he has. But he can\u2019t say anything. He can only listen and take it.</p>\n<p>Because he was right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, okay? And I know you\u2019re gonna say I\u2019m gross for that, but I\u2019m saying this because I love you and I\u2019m not gonna watch you throw your life away.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Komori finishes, he\u2019s breathing heavily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When minutes pass and Sakusa still hasn\u2019t said anything, resorting to staring at the wall as if it's done something wrong, it\u2019s Yachi who takes over, taking her beer bottle and casually placing it on top of Sakusa\u2019s head, the cold condensation sinking into Sakusa\u2019s curls.</p>\n<p>Komori gapes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYachi,\u201d Sakusa blinks at her vacantly. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWaking you up.\u201d She says simply, \u201cSo that it gets to your head that if you go through this hard part, this <em> really </em> hard part, for a little while longer, you\u2019ll have the rest of your life to be happy. <em> Truly </em>happy. And you\u2019ll be happy... because you\u2019ll be free.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leans down so Sakusa has no choice but to look at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was scared once too, you know?\u201d She shares in a low voice, as if letting him in on an important secret, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared. It only makes sense that you are. But you know what you\u2019re supposed to do when you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He asks, because he trusts her, because sometimes, he feels like Yachi Hitoka knows all the secrets of the homo universe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ask for help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three nights ago, Sakusa had listened to Atsumu sob through their joint wall, listened to the rummaging, the footsteps, and their front door opening and closing at three in the morning.</p>\n<p>Two nights ago, the realization had hit him that they had a weeklong break and he had nowhere to go. He didn\u2019t have his family anymore, nor did he have Atsumu\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night before, he\u2019d sat in the kitchen, drinking away his problems, hoping to get some form of sympathy from his two best friends, and instead got a knock to the head with a beer bottle.</p>\n<p>After they\u2019d left, he\u2019d drunk called Atsumu twice to no avail. (<em> Shit, </em>he wasn\u2019t blocked now, was he?)</p>\n<p>Today, he makes a decision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In and out. Inhale, exhale. It\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAkari,\u201d Miya Itsuki calls out from his position in the living room, \u201cDid the twins say when they\u2019ll be back from their hike?\u201d</p>\n<p>Miya Akari hums in thought, her hands busy putting away the leftover fatty tuna onigiri she\u2019d made in preparation for her two sons coming home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t say. The term they\u2019d used was <em> soul searching </em> and <em> twin time.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Itsuki snorts. \u201cWhat a load o\u2019 crap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Akari clicks her tongue. \u201cThose two\u2026 they never could do anythin\u2019 alone. If one of \u2018em did somethin\u2019, the other just <em> had </em>to follow soon after. Shouldn\u2019t even be surprised that it applies even with heartbreak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSamu and Rintarou were a shame\u2026\u201d Itsuki ponders, \u201cBut, it was somethin\u2019 that couldn\u2019t have been helped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime heals and time hurts, is what they say.\u201d Akari says back, \u201cSamu\u2019s been copin\u2019 the best he can and I think he\u2019ll be alright now that he\u2019s spendin\u2019 time with his brother\u2026 Tsumu and Kiyoomi however\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Itsuki sighs. \u201cAtsumu\u2019s our son so I don\u2019t like seein\u2019 him get hurt, but I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t feel for Kiyoomi. He\u2019s livin\u2019 through exactly what we made sure our twins wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could help the boy, y\u2019know?\u201d Akari thinks out loud, walking towards her husband to join him on the couch, \u201cAs a mother of two kids who are gay. But whenever I see him, I can\u2019t help but feel like it isn\u2019t my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Itsuki only hums in response, resting a hand on her thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch, though.\u201d She exhales, \u201cWatchin\u2019 our son hurt so much\u2026 and watchin\u2019 that boy hurt himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her husband only nods softly, squeezing her thigh reassuringly, before switching on the TV with an, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be alright. They\u2019ll do what they need to do\u2026 \u2018n so will we.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun is only starting to set when they hear a hesitant knock on their door.</p>\n<p>Akari sits up slowly, \u201cAlready? I thought they\u2019d be takin\u2019 a few more days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just the neighbor again askin\u2019 us for fresh eggs. Shinsuke\u2019s chickens could be makin\u2019 a fortune if he stopped givin\u2019 \u2018em out for free.\u201d</p>\n<p>Akari peaks through the peephole and turns to look at her husband, knowingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kiyoomi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Itsuki\u2019s eyes widen considerably before he sits up, patting his shirt and messy hair down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, dear. Here we go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Akari takes a deep breath, preparing herself, before she swings the door open, acting surprised. \u201cOh! Kiyoomi! We weren\u2019t expectin\u2019 ya\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>She cuts herself off after getting a clearer view of the boy standing in front of her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes were bloodshot, hair unkempt, completely bundled up, including his gloves and mask, yet he was still shivering underneath it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Akari couldn\u2019t say if it was simply because of the cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi, dear?\u201d She takes him by the elbow, her motherly instincts taking over, \u201cD\u2019ya wanna come in? Yer shaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Itsuki stands up in concern, eyebrows furrowing at Sakusa\u2019s current state.</p>\n<p>Sakusa steps into the living room that he\u2019d been in many times before, yet somehow, it felt so unfamiliar without Atsumu standing right next to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAkari-san, Itsuki-san, I\u2019m really sorry to intrude, I just\u2026\u201d Sakusa drifts off, blinking rapidly, trying to gather his thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gotten on the train in a trance but now that he was here, he didn\u2019t know what to say to them, what he was gonna say to Osamu to avoid being punched in the face, and what the hell he was going to say to Atsumu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Should he just get on his knees and beg for their forgiveness now?</p>\n<p>A hand on his shoulder is what pulls him out of his thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYer never intrudin\u2019 here, I hope ya know that.\u201d Itsuki says, patting him roughly, \u201cYer never intrudin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sakusa bites his bottom lip. \u201cBut is Atsumu here? I need to\u2026 I need to talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere, take a seat first,\u201d Akari insists, leading him to the couch. \u201cYer shakin\u2019 like a leaf, sweetie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t know what it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was it the fact that the parents of the man he\u2019d hurt so much were still treating him with so much kindness despite probably knowing exactly what happened? Was it the fact that he felt like shit for it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was it simply the fact that he was feeling so much warmth from a mother and father, regardless of them not being his own?</p>\n<p>All he does know is that he feels himself starting to unravel.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sorry to say that the twins aren\u2019t here right now,\u201d Itsuki explains, taking a seat next to Sakusa, laying a warm hand on his back. \u201cThey\u2019re out on some mountain, hikin\u2019, said they wanted to have some Twin Time, whatever the hell that means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sakusa says and his voice sounds so small.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels so small right now and he doesn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not exactly sure if what he feels is disappointment or relief, but he knows that it\u2019s heavy. He knows that he\u2019s sitting here and he still doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s supposed to be doing.</p>\n<p>And he keeps wondering, why the hell they\u2019re being so kind to him right now, when they\u2019re supposed to be angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d He says and it comes out as nothing but a whisper. They hear it, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Kiyoomi,\u201d Akari says, taking one of his gloved hands in hers, \u201cDon\u2019t be sayin\u2019 that stuff. Not to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt him.\u201d Sakusa continues, doesn\u2019t know why he can\u2019t seem to stop himself from opening his mouth now that he\u2019s started, \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna keep hurting him, I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d He chokes on a breath, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough o\u2019 that nonsense.\u201d Itsuki says and his voice sounds firm, but not in the way his dad's was. \u201cI need ya to know that we don\u2019t blame you for anythin\u2019. Not even fer a second. Don\u2019t be apologizin\u2019 to us like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, I\u2026\u201d Sakusa stutters, feeling like there should be more yelling involved here, \u201cI tried to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Akari squeezes his hand. \u201cYa don\u2019t need to explain yerself to us. What happens between you and our son, is yer business and yers alone. Us bein\u2019 his parents doesn\u2019t change that. You understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa doesn\u2019t, honestly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, still.\u201d He says, looking up at them. \u201cI love him so much. I didn\u2019t want to hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know why, but the emotions in their eyes at that moment, simply seemed sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cKiyoomi,\u201d Akari starts and Sakusa feels horrified when he hears that she sounds like she\u2019s about to cry, \u201cI may not know what exactly yer goin\u2019 through and I may not know yer parents\u2026 but I am one. I understand what it is to <em> be </em> one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa holds onto her every word. He knows he can trust someone who raised someone like Miya Atsumu.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d She sighs, \u201cparents make mistakes \u2018n do the wrong things, because they believe it\u2019s right. Some never stop \u2018n ask themselves whether or not what\u2019s best for them is what\u2019s best for their child. And they don\u2019t realize how much they\u2019re hurting \u2018em.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s breath catches in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt may not be my place to say, but if ya think that yer parents despise you now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d She says, raising one of her hands to cup his cheek, \u201cThey just don\u2019t realize that their love is the kind of love that\u2019s suffocating you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh god, </em>Sakusa thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven parents do terrible things sometimes,\u201d Itsuki says, \u201cHell, sometimes they\u2019re the one\u2019s capable of doin\u2019 the <em> worst </em> things \u2018n the worst part is they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Akari says, directing a gentle smile to her husband. \u201cAnd sometimes, ya need to be the one to point it out to them. They might listen, they might not, they might ask for forgiveness, they might leave ya forever\u2026 but this life is <em> yours </em>to live, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> You </em>get to decide how ya wanna live it. You are not obligated to do anythin\u2019, hell, you ain\u2019t even obligated to forgive them if they ask for it. They hurt you \u2018n you are allowed to do what ya need to process that pain.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh god, </em>Sakusa thinks again, as his entire body starts to tremble, his vision blurring at the edges.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can choose yer family, Kiyoomi.\u201d Itsuki declares and it sounds like all Kiyoomi has ever needed to hear. \u201cYa already have one that you\u2019d unconsciously chosen right here with ya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em> allowed </em> to be happy.\u201d Akari says, rubbing a thumb against his cheek. \u201cYou should be allowed to live your life without feelin\u2019 like there\u2019s a cost.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Sakusa is taken back to his childhood, back to that one afternoon, sitting in a ratty desk, staring up at a man who he\u2019d believed to be wise, declaring to them, <em> gay people go to hell, </em> unknowingly embedding it into Sakusa Kiyoomi\u2019s brain for the rest of his life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels like he\u2019s ten years old again, when he opens his mouth, and unconsciously asks,</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m gay?\u201d He mumbles.</p>\n<p>Itsuki looks pained.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Akari is close to tears as she tightens her grip on his hands and says, \u201cBecause you are<em> human.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s crying until he\u2019s being pulled into a warm embrace. He feels two pairs of arms wrapped around him, and he thinks, <em> oh. </em></p>\n<p>He tries to breathe, tries to think of his mantra, in and out, inhale, exhale, but it doesn\u2019t work. When he tries to inhale, it comes out as a choked breath. When he tries to exhale, it comes out as a sob ripping out of his throat.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even remember the last time he\u2019d cried. Was it in college? High school? Was it the night he realized he was gay in the first place?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been more than just a couple of years.</p>\n<p>It should feel like relief but it doesn\u2019t.

It\u2019s agonizing. He wants to fucking die.</p>\n<p>But he thinks back to Yachi\u2019s words, her voice saying, <em> once you get through the really hard part, you\u2019ll have the rest of your life to be happy. </em></p>\n<p>So, he lets himself feel it. He lets himself feel every single thing he\u2019d never allowed himself to just sit down and feel.</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s okay to be scared. But you know what you\u2019re supposed to do when you are? </em>\n</p>\n<p>He raises his arms, takes hold of the back of Akari\u2019s shirt, holds onto her for dear life, and allows himself to let go, silently asking for her to catch him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ask for help.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>And he realizes that he has nothing to be afraid of anymore. Because no matter what happens next, his worst fear his whole life had already been resolved.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have to choose between his happiness and his family.</p>\n<p>Right now, he thinks, as he sobs like a child into the arms of a mother and father, he realizes he can have both.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is allowed to have both.

I\u2019m just asking you to spend the rest of your life with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is hysterical at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Sakusa asks, getting more and more nervous the longer he isn\u2019t getting an answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Atsumu nods frantically, \u201cYes, <em> shit, </em> of course I will, what the <em> fuck </em> kinda question is that <em> . </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile forms on Sakusa\u2019s face the exact same moment that tears start falling and without thinking about anything else other than the fact that he\u2019s engaged, he does the first thing he can think of doing.</p>\n<p>Right in front of all the players, the spectators, the crowd of thousands, the cameras broadcasting them on live television, he pulls Atsumu in and kisses him.</p>\n<p>And he thinks, maybe this is what they all meant when they\u2019d told him what it is to live a life that is free, live a life that is true, and live a life that is his.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t hear whether the crowds boo or cheer (they\u2019re <em> definitely </em> cheering), he doesn\u2019t hear his teammates screaming bloody murder, he doesn\u2019t think about whether or not his parents are watching him somewhere out there on TV.</p>\n<p>He only hears the sound of his own heartbeat, only feels the press of lips against his own, and only recognizes the feeling of arms around him that feel exactly like home.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Mom and dad, it\u2019s Kiyoomi.

Honestly, a part of me planned to just never speak to you again. But I know that if I want to move forward without looking back, this is something I have to do. I\u2019m sending you this message to let you know that I\u2019m planning to ask Atsumu to marry me. To be clear, I\u2019m not asking for your permission. I\u2019m just letting you know.

Please don\u2019t come see me yet and please don\u2019t come to my wedding, for both our sakes. It\u2019ll be too soon.

They use monoblock chairs. Ushijima made them balloon animals. The balloons that aren\u2019t animals have <em> Happy Birthday </em> written on them. Atsumu and Sakusa bought their wedding rings in a carnival stand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not a lot of people are invited. The Jackals, the Japan Team, a few friends and teammates from Itachiyama and Inarizaki, Suna, Kita, Yachi. Atsumu\u2019s family, and Sakusa\u2019s family that really just consisted of Komori. Yuu comes, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t wanna pay anyone to officiate a fake wedding, so they got one who\u2019d do it for free. Which happened to be...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so when the fuck\u2019re they gonna start walkin\u2019 down the aisle?\u201d Osamu complains, fiddling with his tux, \u201cThis shit is uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bokuto and Hinata stand at the sides with phones in their hands, vlogging the whole thing to upload on the Jackals\u2019 Youtube channel. This would, apparently, be their confirmation of their relationship. (Which Sakusa\u2019s confused by, because he was pretty sure kissing during the Olympics is a pretty obvious confirmation.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, everyone shut up, they\u2019re about to come out!\u201d Meian yells, shushing everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for them.\u201d Suna comments.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Atsumu who walks out first, looking like he hadn\u2019t spent the majority of his time inside crying, holding onto his father\u2019s arm. Their friends whoop and cheer, Atsumu waving to the small crowd like royalty.</p>\n<p>He stands at the makeshift altar, faces his twin and they instinctively punch each other\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa follows, hand in hand with Akari. Once he walks out, the audience goes quiet, as if it all just finally sunk in, and they\u2019re all turning to look at him but he can only see Atsumu, waiting for him at the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fake wedding, they\u2019re in a front yard, they\u2019re wearing their best outfits for a wedding that has balloon animals and party streamers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa has never been so happy in his life.</p>\n<p>He reaches the end, Akari pressing a kiss to his cheek.</p>\n<p>He steps up onto a weird box that he assumed was supposed to be an altar, and he faces his very soon to be husband.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they meet each other\u2019s eyes, they laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is so stupid.\u201d Sakusa says, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Atsumu retorts, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d Osamu announces with a voice that sounded more like a sports commentator than a wedding officiant, \u201cI will have ya know that I have absolutely no clue how to officiate a wedding, so let\u2019s jus\u2019 get this shit started.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the vows.\u201d Atsumu says, tapping his brother\u2019s arm, \u201cDon\u2019t we start with vows or somethin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing vows?\u201d Sakusa\u2019s eyes widen, \u201cI didn\u2019t write any fucking vows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAtsumu said it\u2019s time for vows!\u201d Osamu yells, \u201cOmi-kun, Tsumu, state your vows \u2018n then put your damn rings on each other\u2026 <em> go!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll start, \u2018cause I actually thought somethin\u2019 up while I was gettin\u2019 my makeup retouched for the third time.\u201d Atsumu coughs, reaching out to take Sakusa\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve warned me.\u201d Sakusa grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cShaddup.\u201d Atsumu huffs. \u201cAnyway\u2026 here goes nothin\u2019. My Omi-Omi,\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s already smiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you since we were sixteen, maybe even fifteen.\u201d He says, interlacing their fingers together, \u201cWe may have taken a lot of detours, we may have let a lot of shit get in the way, but know that I\u2019ve loved you for that long, and know that I\u2019ve never stopped, and that I never will. For all my goddamn life and now for the rest of it too, it\u2019s only you for me, Sakusa Kiyoomi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s all teary again as he takes one of the rings from Osamu and slides it on Sakusa's ring finger, but Sakusa doesn\u2019t even have it in him to make fun of him \u2018cause so is he. He thinks he hears Bokuto sobbing somewhere in the background.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He realizes then and there that he didn\u2019t need to have a vow prepared. He knew exactly all he had to say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMiya Atsumu,\u201d He begins, \u201c- the moment I saw you at fifteen years old, you changed me forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Komori blowing his nose and Sakusa feels like he needs to do the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of my life living a lie in an attempt to convince myself that if I lied long enough, it\u2019d stop being one. But, I\u2019m done now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile on Atsumu\u2019s face is almost ethereal.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout a year ago, during one of our\u2026 <em> detours, </em> a good friend told me something. <em> There\u2019s no point in living a life that isn\u2019t true.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Yuu quietly grins from the audience.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m standing here today,\u201d He says, looking at the rest of his life right in front of him, \u201c- because loving you is the truest thing about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu hands him the ring with a look that says, <em> I trust you </em>, and as he takes it and slides the ring on Atsumu\u2019s finger, he silently makes a promise that he can.</p>\n<p>When they kiss, it feels like his first breath of air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">__</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>SAKUATSU WEDDING VLOG || MSBY BLACK JACKALS</b>\n</p>\n<p>5,901,987 views \u00a0 uploaded 1 day ago</p>\n<p>Everyone, just so you know, we cried during the wedding, cried editing this, and cried rewatching it.
