  "text": "<p>Curiosity killed the cat. Louis is beginning to suspect it\u2019s going to kill him too. At the very least, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s going to kill his social life and his friendship with his best mate, but now that he\u2019s actually gone and done it, there seems to be no way of going back - no rinse and repeat, no ctrl+alt+del, no abort button, no help to be had. He\u2019s fallen into a black hole and he cannot seem to find a way out.</p>\n<p>The black hole is also known as Tumblr. <i>More specifically</i>, it\u2019s known as Tumblr\u2019s <i>Larry Stylinson</i> (and related) tag(s).</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been <i>curious</i>, that was all. He\u2019d just wanted to know what they were talking about and <i>why</i> they were saying the things they were saying. He and Harry got along well, yeah; that was kind of a given seeing as they\u2019d clicked on X-Factor and had pretty much decided they didn\u2019t want to spend another moment apart. They were <i>best mates</i> - each other\u2019s partners in crime, the troublemakers and pranksters extraordinaire. Together, they were absolutely unstoppable and that was absolutely <i>awesome</i>, but thinking they were genuinely in a relationship that went beyond that? Seemed kind of crazy, really. There were so many people who <i>believed</i> it though, and Louis had just wanted to understand so he\u2019d looked it up.</p>\n<p>Big. Mistake.</p>\n<p>Possibly the biggest mistake of his life.</p>\n<p>The first three posts had been funny. The first video had been brilliantly executed and he\u2019d been <i>impressed</i> with the storytelling skills required to create such a believable argument. But it\u2019s four hours later, and he\u2019s still clicking on posts, jumping from one Youtube video to another, reading and watching and, scariest of all, finding himself <i>agreeing with</i> analysis after analysis. It\u2019s actually <i>terrifying</i>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to hit \u201cnext page\u201d and he <i>stops himself</i>. He reminds himself that he <i>is</i> Louis Tomlinson, and that \u201cLarry\u201d is <i>not real</i>. He\u2019s not secretly dating Harry. They are not hiding their illicit love. They do not secretly fuck each other behind closed doors. He hits \u201cnext page\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>I don\u2019t believe in Larry, I believe in true love, lolz.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Louis nods and scrolls (<b><i>OMG LARRY FEELS</i></b>) down (<b><i>Is it just me or does Harry look like he\u2019s imaging taking Lou\u2019s clothes off?</i></b>) a little (<b><i>OMG DID THEY KISS?</i></b>) further (<b><i>OH THEY ARE SO IN LOVE I\u2019M GONNA LIGHT MYSELF ON FIRE</i></b>). </p>\n<p>The next one catches his full attention. He stops scrolling.</p>\n<p><b><i>If for some reason these idiots aren\u2019t already in a relationship, they should be.</i></b> And there\u2019s gif of Harry reaching out to brush his finger against Louis\u2019 skin, and Louis shifting his arm back to get a little more contact and \u2013</p>\n<p>Louis kind of wants to set himself on fire too.</p>\n<p>He stares at it as if he doesn\u2019t recognise it. Because he <i>doesn\u2019t</i> recognise it. He hadn\u2019t even noticed he\u2019d <i>done that</i>. It\u2019s like watching a movie of an actor that looks scarily like you but isn\u2019t you because <i>Louis doesn\u2019t remember doing that</i>. It hadn\u2019t even been a conscious action. He remembers the interview, yeah - remembers everything else except that point of contact.</p>\n<p>The post under it has him looking at Harry like he\u2019s the fucking sun.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fucking adorable picture. Louis\u2019 never really paid attention at the way he looks at Harry - mostly because Harry\u2019s just...special. He\u2019s someone who is infinitely special to Louis and his <i>best friend</i>, and Louis loves him (completely platonically). But he really likes the idea of people believing in love, and Harry is really fucking adorable. Imaginary!Louis could definitely do worse.</p>\n<p>Louis hits reblog without even thinking about it. <b><i>Loving you is like looking into the sun</i></b>, he adds, and before he can really think about what he\u2019s actually doing, he posts it.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It all goes downhill from there.</p>\n<p>He makes his own edit three days later.</p>\n<p>Two days after that, he becomes Tumblr famous.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s collecting together some pictures together for an AU picture set when he starts getting frustrated. He just can\u2019t find the <i>right</i> picture to complete it and, the thing is, he knows one exists. He huffs out a breath and grabs his phone, sending the picture to his email - and crops it enough that it could possibly be anyone. Maybe.</p>\n<p>Probably.</p>\n<p>Whatever. It\u2019s late and he wants to post this so he can finally go to bed already and he\u2019s not thinking of much else beyond that.</p>\n<p>He wakes up to somewhere close to 5000 notes on his post and close to 300 asks. Only then does he realise the enormity of what he\u2019d done. </p>\n<p><b><i>JKAFNHKSFJSKFJSL WHAT</i></b>, says one ask eloquently.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>THAT PICTURE...OH MY GOD KILL ME NOW.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Is that new?</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>WHERE DID YOU GET THAT LAST PICTURE?</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>SOURCE PLS OMG IT\u2019S SO FUCKING SDKLAFJLSJFLSKJDF</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>That is - oHMY ICAN\u2019T EVEN TYPE, THAT PICTURE OMG!!!!!!!! CRYING</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p><b><i>That\u2019s totally fake. That isn\u2019t even Harry\u2019s arm, dumbass.</i> </b> That one actually makes him laugh - and it\u2019s a fucking great feeling, especially with the horror that\u2019s been slowly descending on him as realisation sinks in.</p>\n<p>He keeps laughing when he opens another one to find, <b><i>Tell me the truth. You\u2019re really Harry, aren\u2019t you? OH MY GOD, LARRY IS REAL!!!!!!!!</i>.</b></p>\n<p>It goes on, but Louis doesn\u2019t bother reading any more of them. He posts a quick<b> <i>Oops. Didn\u2019t mean to make Tumblr meltdown. I found the picture on the internet !</i></b></p>\n<p>He tries not to be too happy with himself for the fact that he has several thousand more followers than he did yesterday or the fact that the Larry tag is more active than usual. And it\u2019s <i>happy</i> active rather than full of the angst that\u2019s been all over the place lately. He\u2019s made someone happy today, at least. That counts for something, right?</p>\n<p>His email inbox is practically exploding by the time he\u2019s finished breakfast, and he has to turn off the email notifications before he can even think about leaving the house. He dreads to even think about the state of his Tumblr ask box. The few messages he does take time to read in the car on the way to their interview has him grinning like a loon by the time he steps into the studio. </p>\n<p>It seems Tumblr is torn between thinking he\u2019s an inside man and thinking he\u2019s a fake. There also seems to be a very small percentage who seem to have spent the entirety of last night trying to figure out what he googled to find the picture. There are even a couple who are convinced he\u2019s Harry. Those are his favourites, and he follows them back immediately. Which just sets them off all over again. It\u2019s <i>brilliant</i>.</p>\n<p>He throws an arm around Harry\u2019s waist as soon as he sees him, and Harry tucks himself into Louis\u2019 side easily, his arm going to its customary place around Louis\u2019 shoulder. </p>\n<p>Louis has a momentary flashback to a post he\u2019d seen recently on Tumblr and his step falters. Harry stumbles a little with him - and then falls back into step beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Harry asks, looking a little concerned. Louis grins at him and shrugs, reaching over to tug at one of Harry\u2019s curls. It appears to be staging a rebellion, trying its hardest to resist the oppression of the hairspray and gel that\u2019s been applied to make Harry\u2019s hair look artfully quiffed. </p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s good.\u201d He digs a finger into Harry\u2019s side and Harry squirms closer to him, laughing. Within moments, Harry\u2019s relaxed again, at home against Louis\u2019 side, and Louis finds himself smiling a little wider. <i>Tumblr\u2019d have a field day,</i> he thinks, and tilts his head a little to watch Harry fondly.</p>\n<p>He can definitely see where they\u2019re all coming from.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of \u201cLarry\u201d moments during the interview. If Louis is completely honest with himself (which he tries to be but knows he isn\u2019t always), he instigated more than a few of them himself. On purpose. Harry looks at him a little strangely afterwards - curious, not angry or anything else - and with something Louis can\u2019t quite identify in his eyes, and their publicist and PR team <i>glare</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we were going to tone it down?\u201d one of them says, and Louis looks back as innocently as he can manage.</p>\n<p>\u201cTone what down?\u201d he asks and ignores the dirty looks they send his way.</p>\n<p>Tumblr has a field day. Louis goes to bed with a huge grin on his face (and still ignoring most of his ask box).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Louis continues to hang around Tumblr, reblogging things and making his own gif and picture sets, adding witty captions whenever he can think of them. Sometimes, he\u2019s more amused by them than anyone else, he thinks, because a few of them are even inside jokes that barely anyone understands. He\u2019s ended up with a rather large following for some unknown reason, and people are still arguing over who he actually is and what he actually knows. He ignores most of it. Being Tumblr-famous is possibly even weirder than being actually famous.</p>\n<p>He makes a few friends. There\u2019s one blogger in particular that he spends hours talking to whose sense of humour is fucking <i>brilliant</i>. He calls himself \u201cDusty,\u201d and he keeps Louis entertained like no one else, shares his opinions on so many things - and not just the entire conspiracy that is Larry Stylinson. For a laugh, he decides if this person\u2019s going to go around using Harry\u2019s cat\u2019s name as their pseudonym, Louis\u2019 going to use \u201cTed.\u201d More likely than not, everyone\u2019ll just think they\u2019re taking the piss - another one of those \u201clet\u2019s call ourselves by something related to our ship\u201d sort of things.</p>\n<p>(Why is he even considering himself a shipper? How has this become his life?)</p>\n<p><b><i>New Larry interview!</i></b> comes through in his ask box after their most recent interview makes it online. <b><i>Is it just me or are they getting more obvious</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>HAHAHA,</i></b> Louis sends back. <b><i>They\u2019re so good to us shippers. I\u2019m starting to think they\u2019re playing it up just to keep us entertained.</i></b></p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>If they\u2019re playing, they\u2019re really good actors. You can fake that kind of look, right? I mean, c\u2019mon, they\u2019re totally made for each other.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>It makes Louis pause. It makes Louis <i>think</i>. Lately, he\u2019s been playing it up, yeah. He loves the narrative of the whole Larry Stylinson thing. It\u2019s fascinating and brilliant and so insanely creative, even <i>he</i> wants to believe in this love story. But if he lets himself really think about it...</p>\n<p><b><i>What if,</i> </b>he types, <b><i>hypothetically. What if they aren\u2019t together?</i></b> Louis kind of expects to be laughed at. That\u2019s pretty much what every single other Larry shipper would do; laugh and laugh and tell him to open his eyes and look and - he understands, really, and that kind of conviction is amazing but -</p>\n<p>But Louis also knows the <i>real</i> truth.</p>\n<p><b><i>Then maybe they just haven\u2019t seen it yet,</i></b> comes the reply almost immediately. It surprises him more than he\u2019d care to admit. <b><i>And maybe they\u2019ll realise, one day, that they\u2019re made for each other.</i></b></p>\n<p>Made for each other.</p>\n<p>Louis leans back and stares. </p>\n<p>Maybe they\u2019ll realise they\u2019re made for each other. He thinks about Harry and how easy it is - thinks about how he fits perfectly against Louis\u2019 side, or how he\u2019ll still duck down and tuck his head into Louis\u2019 neck like he did on X-Factor when they were much closer in height, how everything is easier - calmer, more focused - when Harry\u2019s touching him. </p>\n<p>Harry is his <i>best friend</i>. He is <i>not</i> in love with Harry.</p>\n<p>He slams his laptop shut and vows to stay off Tumblr.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>That particular vow lasts all of two days.</p>\n<p>Their PR team seems to have been in discussion with a great many people. They have come to the conclusion that whatever Harry and Louis have been up to, they\u2019ve got to stop it. Louis starts by playing the innocent card - \u201cI have no idea what you mean!\u201d - but their publicist keeps pushing. The powers that be have decided that warning them isn\u2019t work and that the \u201cLarry Stylinson\u201d thing has got out of control.</p>\n<p>They aren\u2019t allowed to sit next to each other in interviews. They\u2019re not allowed to stand next to each other for photos. They are to keep touch to a minimum - and are definitely not allowed to hug or throw their arms around each other.</p>\n<p>Louis feels like the breath\u2019s been punched out of him. He turns to look, wide-eyed, at Harry, who looks back at him with the same expression.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s his <i>best mate</i>. How can they be telling them to stop interacting?</p>\n<p>\u201cI - \u201c Louis starts, just as Harry says, \u201cBut - \u201c</p>\n<p>But their publicist interrupts them both. \u201cThis isn\u2019t up for negotiation,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNow get out there; it\u2019s almost time for the interview.\u201d</p>\n<p>They go through make-up in a daze, constantly glancing over to each other. The interview is even worse. Louis finds himself constantly looking past the others, eyes searching for Harry automatically, trying to catch Harry\u2019s eyes. Both their answers are a little shakier than usual, a little more absent-minded. They\u2019re both clearly distracted, and the boys are doing more than their fair share in trying to keep the interview alive and interesting.</p>\n<p>Louis has never realised exactly how much he needs Harry\u2019s touch - how much Harry\u2019s mere presence beside him steadies him - until now.</p>\n<p>As they slip back into the dressing room, Louis feels Harry step up behind him more than he hears the exhaled, \u201cLou\u201d, and he reaches back to slide his arms around Harry\u2019s waist and draw him closer. Harry wraps his arms around him in return and tucks his face into the crook of Louis\u2019 neck, just breathing slowly. It feels almost like Harry\u2019s found breathing through that interview just as hard as Louis has.</p>\n<p>Tumblr\u2019s on fire by the time Louis gets home. Everyone\u2019s noticed. There\u2019s about a million gifs of him and Harry staring at each other across the couch, and theories range from them breaking up to management conspiracies. Looking at the way Harry\u2019s watching him in those pictures is painful - made worse by knowing <i>first-hand</i> exactly how hard the whole thing was.</p>\n<p>He shuts down the computer without even checking his asks. He doesn\u2019t have the energy.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It gets worse when the \u201cinterview\u201d is published a few days later - their PR team doing their jobs and explaining away the \u201cchange\u201d in Harry and Louis\u2019 relationship. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s affected our friendship,\u201d his PR self is quoted saying. \u201cIt changes how we behave in public.\u201d His PR self is kind of an arsehole. And the bit about the girlfriend\u2019s kind of in-your-face, like everyone\u2019s scared people are going to forget. Tactless, that\u2019s what it is. His PR self has no tact at all. It\u2019s a disaster, really, as far as Louis\u2019 concerned.</p>\n<p>Harry makes up for their lack of contact anywhere public by being even clingier than normal when they\u2019re together in private. He sprawls across Louis on their sofa, keeps his foot tucked under Louis\u2019 thighs in the bus, brushes his fingers against some part of Louis\u2019 body as they pass in the hallway - doesn\u2019t ever stop <i>touching</i> him unless he physically can\u2019t - and Louis soaks in every single point of contact as desperately as Harry does.</p>\n<p>PR approaches them again. Harry\u2019s spread out on the sofa, his head pillowed in Louis\u2019 lap, as they wait for make-up to be ready for them. \u201cYou two really still need to tone down the lo - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re telling me I have to stop looking at Harry now, I\u2019m going to hit you,\u201d Louis says matter-of-factly, and tugs at one of Harry\u2019s curls. Harry glances up at Louis, smiles at him for a moment, and tilts his head further back to stare at PR.</p>\n<p>The PR guy goes away.</p>\n<p>Harry grins at him - and Louis has to consciously stop himself from leaning down and kissing those lips.</p>\n<p>He freezes, eyes widening a little in horror. He has just been thinking about kissing Harry. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s been thinking about <i>kissing</i> Harry.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s thinking about kissing <i>Harry</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLou?\u201d Harry asks - and Louis\u2019 saved from answering by make up calling them.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>That night, he seeks refuge in Tumblr but it\u2019s a fucking <i>depressing</i> scene. All anyone is doing is talking about how sad they look, how upset, how close they are to cracking. None of them - not a single one - has any idea how true that is.</p>\n<p><b><i>Man, it\u2019s all so fucking depressing out there. What do you think happened?</i></b> he sends to Dusty.</p>\n<p><b><i>Not a clue,</i></b> is the reply. <b><i>But I\u2019m sure everything\u2019ll be fine.</i></b></p>\n<p>Louis bites his lip. <b><i>How can you be so sure?</i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>They\u2019re made for each other, aren\u2019t they?</i></b> There\u2019s so much conviction in that one message. <b><i>Whatever\u2019s going on, I just know they\u2019re finding a way to cope. I don\u2019t believe that bullshit that says they aren\u2019t friends though - and I won\u2019t until they stop looking at each other like they\u2019re the only things that matter. We only see what the media want us to see.</i></b></p>\n<p>It makes Louis feel so much better. And it gives him an idea.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Two days later (so he doesn\u2019t look too suspicious), he leaks a backstage picture. It\u2019s nothing huge - just a picture of all of them waiting in the wings to go on stage. Harry\u2019s standing close to him and, if anyone looked closely - Louis just knows that someone will - they\u2019d see Harry\u2019s hand tucked casually just under the edge of Louis\u2019 jacket to press very lightly against Louis\u2019 side. Tumblr goes crazy.</p>\n<p>It becomes a routine. Every time the shippers get too depressed or the tag gets too full of angst, Louis will find a picture that\u2019s not too revealing - that could be from <i>anywhere</i> - and leaks it online, or he\u2019ll tweet something that\u2019s ambiguous enough to be anything from his public account and watch it become a trend.</p>\n<p>He's more invested in this non-existent relationship than he'd care to admit. Somehow, he thinks, if these people still believe in him and Harry, they're going to make it through somehow. He's not even sure what they're going to make it through but their faith gives <i>him</i> hope.</p>\n<p>If he's completely and utterly honest with himself - something that only happens very late at night when he's very, very tired, and possibly when Harry's curled against his side like he belongs there - it gives him hope that he and Harry are going to work out in the end. When he's being honest, he admits that he's thinking about kissing Harry on a regular basis now. </p>\n<p>It kind of terrifies him a lot.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Things come to a head a few weeks later when they\u2019re called in to talk to their management and PR teams. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarry has to move out,\u201d they say, and Louis is standing up before he\u2019s even registered his own movement. Harry\u2019s right beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry demands, fingers curling into a fist beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s where I live got to do with anyone else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one believes this whole thing is affecting your friendship,\u201d they say. \u201cWe think it\u2019s partly to do with the fact that you still live together. Since Louis\u2019 with Eleanor \u2013 oh, stop flapping around, Louis. For all extents and purposes, you\u2019re still with Eleanor.\u201d Louis huffs out a breath and crosses his arms. He\u2019d broken up with her almost two weeks ago. He\u2019d actually kind of broken down and spilled everything to her while eating ice cream from the carton and trying not to sob. El had laughed and laughed and laughed, and had eventually tried to be sympathetic. Louis had gone out the next day and bought her the Burberry bag he knew she\u2019d been eyeing and (still laughing) she\u2019d told him he was the best gay friend ever.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d insisted he was bisexual. She\u2019d laughed some more.</p>\n<p>And then management had told them they weren't actually allowed to break up, and please could they at least <i>pretend</i> to still be dating if they weren\u2019t going to give it a go. El had laughed at that <i>particularly</i> hard. Louis now owed her that stupidly expensive Hermes purse she\u2019d dropped a (very unsubtle) hint about. He was definitely billing management for that. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes more sense,\u201d the PR guy continues, \u201cfor Harry to be the one to want his own bachelor pad and move out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glances at him helplessly. Like always, Louis can read everything in his expression; he\u2019s afraid Louis actually agrees with their management. \u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Louis says, and Harry visibly relaxes, taking an unconscious step towards Louis. \u201cHarry\u2019s not moving out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>You\u2019ll never leave Louis, will you?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>No.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Louis takes a conscious step towards Harry, reaching out to brush against Harry\u2019s hand - which immediately uncurls out of the fist, and Harry relaxes a little more. He turns and gives Louis a soft, sweet smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, guys, we know - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Louis says, interrupting them. He can feel Harry starting to tense next to him and he doesn\u2019t want to see that gorgeous smile turn back into a frown again. \u201cI get it. PR, image, blahblahblah - but let\u2019s just clear something up, yeah? These rumours don\u2019t <i>really</i> affect our friendship - that\u2019s something <i>you</i> want people to believe. We are not actually going to let these rumours <i>really</i> affect our friendship, so stay the hell out of our personal lives, okay? Harry\u2019s not fucking moving out unless he <i>wants</i> to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Management tries to argue. Neither of them listens. The meeting ends without a conclusion, according to their team, but for Louis, the conclusion\u2019s really fucking simple. </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s not moving out. </p>\n<p>No one can separate them if they don\u2019t want to be separated.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Their PR team drops hints that Harry\u2019s moving/moved out anyway. It spreads like wildfire - and if everywhere else is feeling the smoke, Tumblr\u2019s up in flames. It\u2019s a little funny how everyone blames the shippers for it; he even has hate from fans in his ask box. It would have been <i>hilarious</i> if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the \u201cLarry\u201d corner of fandom seems to be taking it all particularly badly.</p>\n<p>People insult him. People insult Harry.</p>\n<p>Mostly, people blame him - which is better than people blaming Harry, of course - but it still hurts.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>How could they do that OMG I\u2019M CRYING. I DON\u2019T BELIEVE IN LOVE ANYMORE.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>HOW THE FUCK DID LOUIS LET IT AFFECT THEM LIKE THAT.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>HARRY\u2019S CLEARLY HEARTBROKEN, LOOK AT HIS FACE - CRYINGOMG.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Harry loves Louis more than Louis loves him.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>LARRY SHIPPERS HAVE DESTROYED THEIR FRIENDSHIP</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Goodbye, Larry Stylinson.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>It hurts.</p>\n<p>He knows there\u2019s nothing he can do - he knows the <i>truth</i> - but it\u2019s all a little overwhelming all the same. He only hesitates for a moment before he opens up Dusty\u2019s ask box and sends, <b><i>What do you think?</i></b></p>\n<p>\n<b><i>That it\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s all bullshit. Harry would never move out, and Lou\u2019d never let </i>anything<i> ruin their friendship.</i></b>\n</p>\n<p><b><i>Yeah,</i></b> Louis replies, reassured. At least one person still has faith in him; chances are if one person still believes, there are others. <b><i>You\u2019re right. They\u2019d never let it happen.</i></b></p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>\u201cwon\u2019t stop \u2018till we surrender...\u201d</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Louis smiles. He\u2019s just closed the lid of his laptop when his door creaks open and Harry pokes his head in. Louis\u2019 smile softens and he shifts over in the bed, tugging his duvet back in silent invitation. Harry dives into the space and tucks himself against Louis\u2019 side, head on Louis\u2019 pillow. Harry shifts around a little to get comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Louis asks, accommodating Harry\u2019s movements until he\u2019s found the position he wants to be in. Louis rearranges himself around that.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Harry mumbles, and it\u2019s just like X-Factor all over again. Louis wraps an arm around Harry and tugs him closer - which results in them shifting around all over again, but this time it\u2019s easier. Natural. Harry tucks himself into a smaller ball and lets Louis curl around him. Just like X-Factor all over again.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that Harry\u2019s taller than him now - bigger, bulkier - and they\u2019re the biggest boyband in the world. It doesn\u2019t matter that Harry\u2019s a Big Deal, probably more famous than any of them, the sex symbol of the ages. He\u2019s curled against Louis like he\u2019s still sixteen, young and excited, overwhelmed and terrified and in desperate need of approval. He tucks himself in under Louis\u2019 chin, breathes out slow and steady against his chest, fingers clinging slightly to Louis\u2019 shirt like he\u2019s the same boy who\u2019d tucked Louis\u2019 namesake bear into his blazer as a good luck charm because Louis believed in him when he wasn\u2019t sure he believed in himself.</p>\n<p>And Louis still wants to protect him from the world.</p>\n<p>He still can\u2019t believe that this brave, beautiful boy gives himself over so completely and without reserve to Louis\u2019 care.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Made for each other.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Holding Harry like this - being in Harry\u2019s orbit - is the most natural thing in the world. Louis tightens his arms around him, strokes a hand lightly through Harry\u2019s curls, loose from the hairspray and gel and slightly damp from the shower, and lets the realisation of something he\u2019s been trying to avoid for a while now come.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s his best mate. And Louis is hopelessly in love with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Louis prompts softly after a few more minutes of silence, when he feels like Harry\u2019s relaxed enough to maybe talk to him about whatever it is. He tips his head to press his lips to Harry\u2019s hair in mute encouragement. </p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t answer him immediately. When he does, his words are slow - slower even than usual - and measured. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna sound really weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the hell\u2019s that mattered with us, Haz? Talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, it takes a few moments for Harry to answer, but Louis isn\u2019t worried. He knows well enough that there\u2019s no point trying to force answers from Harry and he knows Harry will tell him when he\u2019s ready to - when he\u2019s found the right words to express himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cI... Lou, I\u2019m tired,\u201d he lets out on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m tired of pretending. Everything is... Everything\u2019s so complicated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Louis forgets that Harry\u2019s only 19. He\u2019s only two years older, he knows, but Harry\u2019s been in the spotlight since he was far too young, and he acts far too mature for his age now. It sometimes hurts to think that Louis couldn\u2019t protect Harry like he\u2019d always wanted to.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Louis says, sliding his hand down to Harry\u2019s neck to rub his thumb lightly over Harry\u2019s skin, comforting.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t - \u201c Harry huffs out a breath and leans back slightly to meet Louis\u2019 eyes, slowly enough that he doesn\u2019t dislodge Louis\u2019 grip. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean... I mean everything. I mean... Are the rumours so bad that we have to go through all this just to contradict them?\u201d Louis blinks at him, surprised. \u201cI mean, is it so bad that people think we\u2019re in some long term, loving relationship? Is being gay and so fucking in love <i>so bad</i> that they have to do every fucking thing to make me into some womanizing whatsit that\u2019s up for a tumble any time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis feels like someone\u2019s hit him in the stomach. Harry\u2019s so fucking <i>hurt</i> by the whole thing - and Louis had known (of course, he had) that it\u2019s been hard for Harry to pretend they\u2019re barely friends anymore, just as it\u2019s been for Louis. But he\u2019d honestly had no idea exactly how much pain this public persona they\u2019ve given Harry has been getting to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry...\u201d He trails off because he honestly has no idea what he can say to make it better. \u201cHaz.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry closes his eyes and lets out a breath, curling back up close again, clinging even more tightly than before. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it so bad,\u201d Harry mumbles against Louis\u2019 neck. \u201cThat people believe I\u2019m in love with you? I like that me better than the other one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis shifts so he can press a kiss to Harry\u2019s forehead, pulling back because he wants to say this to Harry and not to Harry\u2019s curls. Harry resists for a few moments, but he eventually tilts his head back and reluctantly meets Louis\u2019 eyes. Louis smiles at him. \u201cI like <i>this</i> Harry the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Harry smiles back at him, all Louis thinks is <i>hallelujah</i> because it\u2019s like the sun coming out from behind a cloud, and Louis feels like he can breathe freely again - but that only lasts a moment because Harry\u2019s smile dims just a little and Harry looks away.</p>\n<p>Louis frowns and tilts Harry\u2019s face to meet his eyes again. \u201cHaz, what is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry seems to have an internal debate with himself, eyes flickering anywhere but to Louis\u2019 face, and he frowns, biting his lip absently as though trying really hard to figure out what he should say. He finally gives a resigned sigh and meets Louis\u2019 eyes - and there, in Harry\u2019s familiar green eyes, are emotions Louis\u2019 never seen directed at him before.</p>\n<p>Wariness. Trepidation. A little fear.</p>\n<p>Louis immediately vows that he will do everything in his power never to see this look on Harry\u2019s face ever again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if,\u201d Harry begins slowly, \u201cthis Harry\u2019s not actually all that different from...one of the others?\u201d The question is tacked on almost as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. I know better than to believe that woma - \u201c And then Louis\u2019 brain catches up with his mouth and he snaps his mouth shut. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gives a soft, self-deprecating little laugh. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cOh.\u201d And then he tries to pull away. Louis doesn\u2019t let him. \u201cLou - Louis, let me - just. Let go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. I don\u2019t - just - let me go and - Louis.\u201d Louis\u2019 name comes out as a whine - the same sound Harry makes when Louis\u2019 being particularly stubborn or idiotic or both of the above. Holding onto Harry when he\u2019s struggling to get away is something of an art form, but, luckily for Louis, he\u2019s perfected it over the years. The fact that this situation is actually almost <i>normal</i> for them despite the pretty much paradigm-shifting statement Harry\u2019s just dropped on him actually makes Louis laugh. Harry stills as though the sound surprises him and he finally <i>stops</i> and looks - well, glares - at Louis. He tries to stop laughing but he can\u2019t completely wipe the amusement from his features. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. This isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Styles,\u201d Louis says, brushing his fingers over Harry\u2019s scowl and pinching his cheeks, immediately morphing Harry\u2019s face into a smile. It gets the desired reaction; Harry smiles despite himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Harry says again. The smile\u2019s still there but it doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes, and Harry\u2019s voice is uncharacteristically small, tentative.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very funny,\u201d Louis says firmly. \u201cBecause, you see, I\u2019m a fan of <i>that</i> particular Harry too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinks, and Louis watches as realisation dawns, and the wariness in Harry\u2019s eyes turns into a tentative, heartbreaking kind of hope. He worries his lower lip in an achingly familiar gesture and looks at Louis before asking carefully, \u201c...really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Louis says, and he just can\u2019t keep the shit-eating grin off his face. This is... he doesn\u2019t even know what this is. Brilliant, he thinks, that\u2019s what it is. \u201cYou see, I\u2019ve been following this rather wonderful love story unfold on this social media site. In the story so far, our two heroes are really hopelessly, stupidly in love, but they\u2019re being kept apart by a manipulative and <i>terrible</i> management that - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cForbids them to do so much as touch,\u201d Harry finishes, and <i>laughs</i>. \u201cYou little shit, you\u2019re on Tumblr.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Louis admits, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Larry shipper.\u201d He leans in a little closer. \u201cSee, I think Harry and Louis are made for each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry, to Louis\u2019 surprise, narrows his eyes at him suspiciously - and then jabs him <i>hard</i> in the stomach. \u201cI know who you are! You - I should have fucking <i>known</i>. No one else could have had some of those photos.\u201d He\u2019s laughing again, jabbing harder even as Louis tries to squirm away without letting Harry go. Now that he\u2019s got his hands on him properly, he\u2019s not sure he ever wants to let go. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sharing <i>private photos</i>, you arse!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry only puts up a minimal amount of resistance when Louis goes on the attack, rolling them over, catching Harry\u2019s wrists and pinning him to the bed. Harry just beams up at him and doesn\u2019t even fight his grip. \u201cI was helping the narrative along,\u201d Louis says, eyes drawn to Harry\u2019s mouth as Harry\u2019s tongue darts out to lick his lips. \u201cWhen it seemed like it needed a little...push.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still staring at Harry\u2019s mouth when Harry licks his lips again, and Louis mimics the movement unconsciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cLouis,\u201d Harry breathes, and Louis watches his mouth move to form Louis\u2019 name, absolutely captivated. \u201cLou, for the love of <i>everything</i>, please - <i>please</i> kiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis kisses him.</p>\n<p>Everything falls into place. It\u2019s terrible and cliched and Louis <i>doesn\u2019t care</i> because his world narrows to just this - just them - just Harry\u2019s lips moving against his, Harry\u2019s tongue licking at the seam of his mouth, teasing, drawing Louis deeper into the kiss. Harry tastes like toothpaste and <i>Harry</i>, and it\u2019s more addictive than anything he\u2019s ever tasted in his life. He moans low and licks deeper into Harry\u2019s mouth, fingers tightening around his wrist - and Harry <i>mewls</i>, mouth going a little slack before he surges up into that kiss, harder, hungrier, needier. The sound turns into a moan as Louis shifts their positions, nudging Harry\u2019s legs apart so he can fit between them, and rubs their dicks together.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Louis breathes as they break for air. Harry doesn\u2019t let Louis move away - and Louis doesn\u2019t, just turns his head and tries to suck in oxygen despite the fact that he thinks he might need <i>Harry</i> more than he needs to breathe right now. Harry nuzzles against his cheek, panting softly. \u201cFuck, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry mumbles, arching his hips to rub against Louis shamelessly. \u201cFuck Harry. That\u2019s a good idea. Louis should fuck Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis laughs breathlessly, feeling a little desperately because - <i>fuck</i> - that\u2019s possibly the hottest thing he\u2019s ever heard. \u201cAre you answering the question of who tops, finally?\u201d he teases, trying to give himself a little time to calm down.</p>\n<p>Harry gives a little growl, but it sounds half-hearted - and tapers off into a slow, drawn out moan as Louis grinds down against him deliberately. \u201cWe - we can switch,\u201d Harry manages to stutter out. \u201cLike Mario Kart. But today - but right now - god, Louis, I\u2019ve waited for too fucking long, so <i>get on with it</i>. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>Well then.</p>\n<p>Louis has to take a moment to actually find his <i>brain</i> because he\u2019s pretty sure it just melted from the combined hotness that\u2019s Harry rocking against him and Harry moaning and Harry talking in <i>that voice</i> and saying <i>those things</i>. He thinks he might have grossly underestimated exactly how destructively <i>gorgeous</i> Harry actually is - he and the rest of the known world - and he\u2019d rated Harry\u2019s ability pretty damn high to start with.</p>\n<p>He tries to get to his bedside draw without actually moving away from Harry. He doesn\u2019t succeed. He huffs out a breath and kisses Harry again, rocking down hard against him just to hear that gasp-moan, just to swallow it in his kiss, just to feel Harry melt into the bed, feel his cock twitch against Louis\u2019 - and then he uses an inhuman amount of effort to pull away, crawling over to the side of the bed to search for his supplies.</p>\n<p>He makes the mistake of glancing back at Harry as he does so and he has to bite back a moan, and it takes twice the amount of effort as usual to locate the lube. He can\u2019t tear his eyes away. Harry\u2019s shrugged out of his shorts and curled his hand around his dick, stroking lazily, not even really focused on that at all. His eyes are fixed on Louis, pupils expanded until Louis can barely see the green of his irises anymore. His mouth\u2019s red and puffy, parted as Harry draws in soft panted breaths - and he looks absolutely perfect. Sin and temptation personified.</p>\n<p>And Harry looks like this for <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>He lets out a low moan and has to grasp the base of his cock firmly just to stop himself shooting his load. He\u2019s not ready for this to be over quite yet because <i>fuck</i>, Harry looks like this for him - waiting for him - but on the other hand - <i>fuck</i>. He really needs to fucking get on with it. He finally locates the lube and starts to crawl back to Harry when he realises something.</p>\n<p>He stops and glances back at his bedside table, hesitating before he shifts the last few centimeters to Harry. He leans down and kisses him hard. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, love,\u201d he says carefully, and it\u2019s torture in itself that he\u2019s going to have to say this at all. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I can fuck you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry <i>whines</i>. \u201cLouis - Louis, please. I need - I want - I don\u2019t want to wait. I\u2019ve waited and - I <i>need</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove,\u201d he says again, and really, he needs to be sainted for this. \u201cNo condoms.\u201d His sex life hasn\u2019t exactly been anything to brag about - except if it\u2019s a bragging competition about who has been having the <i>least</i> sex. He\u2019d just thrown away a box of expired condoms last month.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Harry says, tugging Louis back down so he can kiss him. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m clean.\u201d He nips at Louis\u2019 lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m <i>clean</i>. I\u2019ve never even - You are too, right?\u201d Louis doesn\u2019t miss the abrupt change in the direction of that last sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Louis answers, but he pulls back despite Harry grabbing at him, despite Harry trying to follow his lips with his own. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pouts at him - but no, this is too important and Louis\u2019 not giving in that easily. </p>\n<p>Harry sighs, dramatic and impatient. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone all the way,\u201d he mumbles, flushing, but determinedly grabbing Louis\u2019 shirt and tugging it over his head, throwing it to the side somewhere to join the rest of the mess on Louis\u2019 floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait - wait, I - \u201c Harry shuts him up with a solid kiss. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t. No. No waiting,\u201d Harry says, sliding his hand down to push Louis\u2019 boxers off his hips as well. \u201cNo more <i>waiting</i>, Lou, please. I haven\u2019t because I didn\u2019t want to. Because I was <i>waiting</i>. Because none of it - none of them - felt right. I was waiting for it to feel right and - it\u2019s <i>you</i>. I was waiting for you.\u201d They both know Harry\u2019s rambling - he\u2019s always rambling, especially when he\u2019s excited and nervous all at once - but it\u2019s stupidly perfect anyway and the entire concept of it just blows Louis\u2019 mind.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Made for each other.</i>\n</p>\n<p>No one will ever know how right - how fucking perfect - that statement really is.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Louis says. He shifts to slide the boxers off, using the moment to tug Harry up so he can get rid of the flimsy t-shirt Harry has on as well. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to go slow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gives an impatient huff. \u201cI\u2019m not a complete virgin, okay? I\u2019ve had more than a few things in my arse - just no one\u2019s fucked me yet. So please, please, please, Lou - please don\u2019t make me - oh <i>fuck</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis slides the finger in a little deeper, grinning at the expression on Harry\u2019s face. His breathing\u2019s gone a little ragged and there\u2019s even more colour in his cheeks than before. Louis\u2019d always known that his knowledge of Harry\u2019s tendency to not pay attention to anything except his own rambling when he really got started would come in handy one day.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat feels so - that\u2019s. God, <i>Lou</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Louis says, absurdly proud of himself. \u201cYou look fucking gorgeous, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opens his eyes and smiles at Louis and it\u2019s so achingly sweet, achingly beautiful that Louis\u2019 breath physically catches. This is so much more than just about desire; he\u2019s filled with so much <i>love</i> for this boy under him that he thinks he might be bursting at the seams. He finally understands every single cliche in the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Louis says, shifting so he can lean down and kiss Harry. \u201cI love you so fucking much, Haz, you don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>know</i>,\u201d Harry says, rocking back against his fingers - but his eyes tell Louis everything he needs to know; Harry does know. Harry knows because - \u201cI love you too, now please, Louis, I need - \u201c</p>\n<p>Louis slides in another finger next to the first, slow and patient and - god - Harry\u2019s so fucking tight. He hears the sharp inhale that tells him it hurts and he stills, wriggles his fingers just a little, gentle and patient, waiting until - \u201cOkay,\u201d Harry breathes, eyes opening again. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis takes it slow after that - so fucking slow - despite Harry\u2019s attempts to hurry him along, all moans and rocking and pleading, but Louis won\u2019t hurt him - won\u2019t let this hurt any more than it has to, because Harry\u2019s given him this gift, Harry\u2019s trusting him with this, giving himself over, and Louis\u2019 going to take care of Harry, body and heart and soul.</p>\n<p>Finally, when Harry\u2019s thrashing against the bed, arching and rocking, flushed and panting, body opened and relaxed, and <i>begging</i>, Louis flicks out his fingers and slicks up his dick and - stops. He puts his hands lightly on Harry\u2019s hips, tilting them up a little. \u201cHaz,\u201d he calls, and he watches lust-blown eyes open to meet his gaze. \u201cThis would hurt less if you were on your hands and - \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry croaks out and reaches up to wrap his arms around Louis\u2019 neck. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeats firmly. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis smiles. \u201cGood,\u201d he says, and he shifts again, reaches down to line himself up and presses in <i>slowly</i> as he leans forward to distract Harry as best as he can with a kiss. Harry\u2019s moan is edged with pain - and Louis forces himself to go even <i>slower</i> despite the tight-amazing-heat of Harry\u2019s body and - <i>fuck</i>, this is really happening.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finally in, when he feels Harry\u2019s body relax around him, when Harry\u2019s breathing goes from stuttered-pain to need-and-want-and-please and Harry rolls his hips, Louis feels like everything is blindingly and <i>obviously</i> right with the world. They find a rhythm almost immediately - as natural as everything else they do together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s perfect. Everything about it is perfect.</p>\n<p>Louis leans up to meet Harry\u2019s eyes and laughs at the expression mirrored there, leans in to kiss him even as breathless as they both are until the kisses turn into just lips touching, just panting against each other\u2019s mouths, smiling because nothing\u2019s ever felt this good, this right - smiling because they\u2019re together, they\u2019re two pieces of a puzzle, two halves of a whole and every other cliche in existence - and it\u2019s <i>perfect</i>.</p>\n<p>When they come, they come almost in unison - a hot rush of amazing and liberating and every other adjective Louis can\u2019t even come up with, doesn\u2019t even know. It\u2019s too much and not enough and just right and - and when they come down from the high, they\u2019re still giddy with it, still trading soft, sweet, breathless kisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Louis says as they curl up together, cleaner courtesy of a warm washcloth. They\u2019re pressed up close against each other, avoiding the wet spot on the bed. </p>\n<p>Harry smiles brilliantly. \u201cI love you too,\u201d he says. \u201cI have for a while actually.\u201d He kisses Louis\u2019 neck softly before he shifts, craning his neck up to catch Louis\u2019 lips. His smile widens and he does it again, and Louis knows how that feels. He can\u2019t quite believe he gets to do this as well. He\u2019d never actually dared to really imagine what it would be like; he\u2019d just lived vicariously through other people\u2019s faith and other people\u2019s imaginations.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs, settling his head back on Louis\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWhat was I meant to say? I guess I thought\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe it wasn\u2019t time yet. Maybe it was too soon to say anything, and maybe you\u2019d figure it out eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis raises an eyebrow and shifts to look down at Harry. \u201cFigure what out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiles a little more and shrugs again. \u201cThat we\u2019re meant to be together. That we\u2019re made for each other. That you complete me and vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s awfully presumptive of you,\u201d Louis teases, but Harry just laughs and gives him a knowing grin. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s true,\u201d he points out, and Louis has to concede the point. It is true. He\u2019s nothing without Harry. Even before \u2013 before Tumblr and the shipping, before being told to stop touching, before all of that \u2013 Harry has been the best thing X-Factor helped him find. Niall, Liam and Zayn, and One Direction too, of course \u2013 but <i>Harry</i> most of all.</p>\n<p>Louis bites Harry\u2019s neck in retaliation, not even pausing to think about the consequences of that tomorrow. It\u2019s only when he pulls back that he realises he\u2019s left teethmarks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d he says, completely unapologetically. </p>\n<p>Harry laughs. \u201cOops,\u201d he echoes and cuddles closer.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to fall asleep when something occurs to him. \u201cHarry,\u201d he says, nudging Harry lightly until he gets a sleepy \u201chuh?\u201d in reply. \u201cYou said you knew who I was on Tumblr, right?\u201d Another sleepy affirmative. Louis pauses. \u201c<i>How?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPictures,\u201d Harry mutters against his skin. \u201cTold you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis prods him in the cheek right where his dimple would be if he was smiling. \u201cI mean, does that mean you\u2019ve read my Tumblr?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Harry says fondly, nipping at Louis\u2019 skin, before he nuzzles him again. \u201cI talk to you almost everyday there. Now go to sleep. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Louis blinks and lets that sink in. And then he starts laughing. That makes so much sense. He tucks Harry in against him as close as he possibly can. He\u2019s still smiling when he drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>A few days later, Louis decides to spread some of his happiness to others.</p>\n<p>The picture is grainy, taken from far away. To him, him and Harry are immediately recognisable, but he supposes there\u2019s enough distortion in the picture that they could <i>arguably</i> be a couple that looks a <i>lot</i> like them. Anything that would leave no doubt as to the fact that it\u2019s them \u2013 their tattoos, mostly \u2013 are not distinguishable in the photo. Louis knows it\u2019ll be enough even if he really wants to give them more, leave absolutely no doubt as to who he belongs to now that it\u2019s really the <i>truth</i>. </p>\n<p>Harry wraps his arms around Louis\u2019 waist and props his chin on Louis\u2019 shoulder as Louis composes the rest of the post.</p>\n<p>\u201cPR\u2019s going to kill us,\u201d Harry says, laughing. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t prove it\u2019s us,\u201d Louis argues, turning around to steal a kiss and he happily lets himself be momentarily distracted before he goes back to finishing up.</p>\n<p><b><i>It is what it is,</i></b> he writes. <b><i>Can\u2019t hide what\u2019s real. Can\u2019t deny what\u2019s meant to be.</i></b></p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Won\u2019t stop \u2018till we surrender.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>He tags it <b>#bravery</b> and <b>#larry stylinson</b> and <b>#larry is real</b> and posts it. Almost immediately, the number of notes goes up to 20. Louis\u2019 insanely pleased with himself and it must show on his face because Harry laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTumblr fame\u2019s gonna get to your head,\u201d he says, nosing lightly at Louis\u2019 cheek. </p>\n<p>For a moment, Louis thinks about checking the tag, checking the reblogs, seeing what everyone else is saying about the picture. He wants to know if it helps people to <i>believe</i> - but he looks back at Harry and thinks, <i>I don\u2019t care</i>. What he has \u2013 what they have \u2013 is real and it doesn\u2019t <i>matter</i> what anyone else believes. </p>\n<p>He knows for a <i>fact</i> that this is real. </p>\n<p>This is meant to be.</p>\n<p>This \u2013 Louis and Harry, Harry and Louis, Larry Stylinson \u2013 whatever name you want to give to this thing between them \u2013 is <i>love.</i></p>\n<p>And love is real.</p>"
