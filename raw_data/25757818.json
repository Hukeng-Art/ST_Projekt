  "summary": "<p>Well, in a day of revelations, it turns out that Izuku isn't as vanilla as Katsuki previously thought. Unfortunately, that fascinating discovery is overshadowed by Izuku's dumbassery, because he has zero concept of aftercare. </p>\n<p>\"Don't go to anyone else,\" Katsuki says, because screw it. He can do a better job anyways. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or; Katsuki finds Izuku on a bad drop.</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is about five milliseconds away from blasting a hole in this door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s really really thinking about it \u2013 weighing both sides seriously, all the pros and cons. On one hand, he gets to stop standing out in the hallway while Izuku continues to flutter around and ignore his phone like a fucking moron \u2013 and future cons; \u00a0Katsuki gets chewed out for the broken door.</p>\n<p>Ah, well.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku!\u201d Katsuki kicks the door with his foot. \u201cOpen the damn door before I blow the hinges off!\u201d</p>\n<p>Who even let Izuku get his own apartment in the first place? Yeah yeah top ten hero this blah blah strongest that, <em>what the fuck ever, </em>Izuku barely knows how to make rice. This man should not be allowed to live alone, period.</p>\n<p>Aghh, why the hell did Katsuki ever agree to partner up Izuku in the first place? They\u2019ve worked as pros for almost three years now, and sure Deku can throw down in a fight, but Katsuki has about two dozen reports that need Izuku\u2019s statement and if Katsuki gets <em>one more </em>phone call from the hero commission, Katsuki is going to throw someone off a bridge (metaphor, metaphor! Jesus Christ, don\u2019t send him back to counseling).</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDeku!!!</em>\u201d Katsuki hisses. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019 strangle you for this!\u201d</p>\n<p>One more kick, and the lock gives.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Katsuki curses, and steps in to close the door behind him. \u201cYour apartment is a piece of shit. You\u2019re on a pro salary; it\u2019s time you damn well use it!\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get an answer. Katsuki squints suspiciously, and checks his watch. Izuku\u2019s dumb red shoes are in the hall, and it\u2019s ten pm on a Saturday, so Izuku <em>should </em>be home. Well \u2013 unless he\u2019s out with his annoying friends, but that nerd never goes anywhere without attempting to drag him along, or without telling Katsuki about it in a billion texts. His phone hasn\u2019t blown up, so \u2013 he\u2019s definitely not out drinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, Deku? You home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn, Izuku will kill him if he finds out he broke into his apartment. Eh, whatever, he\u2019ll replace the lock later. Katsuki sets down his bag and wanders further in. It\u2019s the same as the last time Katsuki saw it; the All Might obsession is less severe, but Izuku still has a few choice posters framed on the wall. Photographs, fanart, a shelf of their team\u2019s first gen of figurines. Kinda\u2019 creepy, but Katsuki won\u2019t pretend he doesn\u2019t have the pre-productions hiding in a bin under his bed.</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinks heavily when he finds Izuku standing in the middle of the kitchen, staring into the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cAye!\u201d Katsuki shouts, stomping towards him. \u201cWhy the hell\u2019re you ignoring me! I need your sig-\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku suddenly jumps out of his skin; a full startle, like Katsuki had jabbed him with an electric baton. It\u2019s so sudden that it (almost) scares Katsuki shitless.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh \u2013\u201d Izuku shakes. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2013 oh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit dude, what the hell is your problem?\u201d Katsuki throws up his arms. \u201cHow the fuck did you not hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t look right. Well \u2013 he looks fine physically but \u2013 he\u2019s looking at Katsuki like he\u2019s a total stranger. Katsuki leans closer, and Izuku\u2019s eyes don\u2019t track him. Mentally, he\u2019s somewhere far away.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku blinks, and it looks like he\u2019s trying to shake himself out of it. \u201cSorry. I was \u2013 I\u2019m. Kacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Okay, that\u2019s weird. Some of Katsuki\u2019s anger ebbs into concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, what\u2019s wrong? Did you get hit with a weird quirk or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t be the first time, but hello, it\u2019s their day <em>off. </em>He steps closer, checking Izuku for injuries, but Izuku trembles and slams his back into the pantry cabinet. It rattles and shakes, because Izuku is almost two-hundred pounds of muscle, not unlike Katsuki himself. But the <em>symbol of peace </em>shouldn\u2019t tremble like that. It\u2019s \u2013 <em>wrong. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Izuku says, and he repeats it like he\u2019s trying to convince himself. \u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki snarls, and grabs him by the back of the neck. He tries to get Izuku to look him in the eye, but he\u2019s jerking out of his grip like a disoriented spaz.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re on drugs I\u2019m gonna\u2019 be so fucking pissed at you.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku flinches. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s\u2026also strange. They\u2019re partners. Katsuki has carried this guy to the hospital on his back more times than he\u2019d like to admit.</p>\n<p>Katsuki grips Izuku\u2019s head like a dog, and pries open one of his eyes by the bottom lid. Izuku is too out of it to fight him, but he\u2019s still naturally strong and a pain in the ass, so Katsuki hisses <em>\u201cStay still!\u201d </em>and Izuku freezes full stop.</p>\n<p>Well, his pupils aren\u2019t dilated, but they\u2019re not tracking movement. He looks foggy and\u2026</p>\n<p>Katsuki pushes up his bangs to check his temperature. Izuku <em>shivers. </em>Not a flinch, not a fight \u2013 but a full body shudder, like Katsuki just scratched down his back with his nails. He makes a short, breathy sound, and Katsuki feels dread squeeze in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku exhales. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t touch me \u2013 I don\u2019t deserve it \u2013 I can handle this, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Don\u2019t deserve it? </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s eyes snap wide open.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way, right? No way \u2013 it has to be something else. Katsuki tries desperately to convince himself, but all the signs are there.</p>\n<p>Katsuki grabs Izuku\u2019s shirt sleeve and pushes it up to his elbow. Sure enough, there are rope burns on his wrists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that a surprise,\u201d Katsuki murmurs. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you had it in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d Izuku squirms. \u201cI\u2019m dirty. <em>I\u2019m bad \u2013 </em>\u00a0I was bad \u2013 that\u2019s why \u2013\u201d Izuku slams a hand over his mouth, like two sides of his brain are arguing with each other. The reality of the situation hits Katsuki like a bullet train, and his morbid fascination is derailed right out the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re dropped.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m okay. I deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did this?!\u201d Katsuki growls, grabbing Izuku\u2019s wrist, which has been reddened on top of old scars. He brings it up to Izuku\u2019s field of view. \u201cDeku, tell me their name. Where did you meet them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku struggles to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter my <em>ass!</em>\u201d Katsuki shouts, and Izuku flinches hard against the wall, and Katsuki internally kicks himself in the face. He knows he can\u2019t yell right now (no matter how much he wants to), so Katsuki forces himself to be calm, pushes down all the uncanny rage and the desire to explode everything in a ten-mile radius. Katsuki presses his hand to Izuku\u2019s cheek, and tries to speak evenly. \u201cDeku, you\u2019re in subspace right now. Whoever you were with should <em>not </em>have left you like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster was good to me. It isn\u2019t his fault!\u201d Izuku cries, and his voice begins to crack, and Katsuki internally curses this guy to hell and back. Izuku looks embarrassed, like he\u2019s semi-aware of what he\u2019s saying, but can\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>Alright, one problem at a time. Katsuki pets softly over Izuku\u2019s cheek, and asks, \u201cDoes he always leave you like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shivers like he\u2019s never been touched in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cYe-es sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sir. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck,\u201d Katsuki notes. He pets across Izuku\u2019s sweaty bangs, and distracts him as he pulls his shirt collar away to see how fucked up his neck is. He can\u2019t see much like this, damn. \u201cIzuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes look up, still blinking like he\u2019s trying to see in the dark.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to go back in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no! I just need some water, please. <em>Please.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his knuckles over his cheeks, up to his temple, and down to Izuku\u2019s ears. He can feel a possessive instinct taking over, but Katsuki knows he needs to keep a level head about this. Izuku is not <em>his</em> sub.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen very carefully. I\u2019m going to tell you everything I do before I do it,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cI\u2019m going to coax you back in there, you\u2019re going to ride out the rest of your drop with me \u2013 and then I\u2019m going to pull you back out. Do you understand? I\u2019m going to catch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku cries, but it doesn\u2019t even look like crying. Water just falls out of his eyes, off his cheeks and to the floor \u2013 as if he doesn\u2019t even notice.</p>\n<p>\u201cKa-cchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki could level a town right now. Whoever did this is going to wish they were never <em>born. </em></p>\n<p>It\u2019s eating him up inside \u2013 the overwhelming desire to calm and hold and <em>kiss \u2013 </em>but this isn\u2019t his \u2013 Izuku is <em>NOT </em>his \u2013 and Katsuki has to keep those two thoughts entirely separate.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you,\u201d Katsuki presses.</p>\n<p>Izuku sways a little, and brings a hand to rest at his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki has seen Izuku naked a thousand times, but he doesn\u2019t want to push any boundaries right now (nothing irreparable, nothing that\u2019ll burn this feeble friendship they\u2019ve molded from ash), so Katsuki places Izuku in the tub in his underwear.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still fighting the drop \u2013 Katsuki can see it in his eyes. He gets the bath good and hot, and nudges Izuku by the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cLay down with your head on the rim.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku follows without question.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Katsuki blurts, and then flinches. But Izuku\u2019s chest shudders, so Katsuki plays it off. \u201cQuit fighting it. I told you I was here for you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d Izuku says, and then frowns, like he knows something isn\u2019t right. Obviously, it would be disorienting to receive aftercare from someone you <em>didn\u2019t </em>sleep with, so Katsuki grabs the empty cup off of Izuku\u2019s sink and sits on the rim of the tub.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can call me sir,\u201d Katsuki says, fitting his fingers against Izuku\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou can call me whatever you\u2019d like, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>It should be awkward. Katsuki should feel sick and gross \u2013 this is his <em>best friend, </em>fuck, but it\u2019s like the other part of his brain has stepped in, and he just wants to be what Izuku needs right now. Whatever the fuck that is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pour water on your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki scoops up water and drizzles it slowly, flattening down curls section by section. He lets it run like a stream, gentle and calming. Water drizzles down wide, firm shoulders, down muscle and scars and scars and more scars.</p>\n<p>Katsuki has done this particular trick on hard cases in the past \u2013 and after the third cup of water, Izuku\u2019s eyes slide shut.</p>\n<p>Now, Katsuki can peek at his injuries. He pours another cup of water off of Izuku\u2019s wet hair, letting it run down his back in droplets, and Katsuki studies the rope burns on Izuku\u2019s wrists and throat. They aren\u2019t bloody, but Katsuki can see open wounds on his thighs, leading up and under his boxers \u2013 and Katsuki scowls, because he would\u2019ve treated those before letting a partner walk out the door.</p>\n<p>Izuku has had much worse in battle, <em>obviously, </em>but this is different. This is sex, not crime fighting, and if Izuku doesn\u2019t know the difference, Katsuki is about to give him the lecture of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Katsuki whispers, then bites his cheek. Luckily, Izuku didn\u2019t hear it, so Katsuki grabs the shampoo and lathers it in his hands. \u201cIzuku, are you with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Katsuki says, and leans forward to lather up his hair. \u201cI want you to feel good, but I want you to stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d Izuku repeats, and Katsuki\u2019s chest rolls around in content. This is difficult because Katsuki doesn\u2019t know <em>what </em>their scene was, and has no idea what Izuku is into, or what is comforting in the first place. Fuck, this is <em>Deku. </em>As of thirty minutes ago, Katsuki thought he was as vanilla as they came.</p>\n<p>Alright, well. Praise has gotten him this far, let\u2019s throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing perfect, this is exactly what I asked. I\u2019m very proud of you for sticking it out this far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and when his eyes open, they\u2019re what Katsuki was looking for; fuzzy and far away and <em>calm. </em>He\u2019s under again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hmm, so he\u2019s a baby, not a brat. Alright, praise it is then. Shoulda\u2019 known, damn Deku.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill polite as ever,\u201d Katsuki says, and rises the shampoo out of his hair. \u201cTip your head back like \u2013 mhm, like that. Someone trained you well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks at him happily, puffed up and proud, and Katsuki is relieved, because that\u2019s what he <em>should </em>look like right now. He\u2019s staring at Katsuki all fond, and this is what Izuku\u2019s caretaker would be receiving, if he\u2019d done his fucking job right.</p>\n<p>With time, Katsuki notices that he\u2019s pulling Izuku\u2019s attention. He\u2019s no longer floating in the middle of nowhere, but is focused on Katsuki as he finishes washing his hair. It feels good. Like he\u2019s stealing precious treasure from a huge dickwad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Katsuki praises. \u201cKeep watching me. Good <em>boy, </em>Izuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubs his knuckles into Izuku\u2019s cheeks. Circles and circles, he pets up to his scalp, then under his chin like a dog. Izuku turns his head this way and that, eager to please \u2013 which are all good signs. Katsuki wants to keep him under just a little while longer, until it\u2019s safe to bring him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me the truth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hesitates. He stares through the haze, but grounds himself in Katsuki\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was hurting earlier. But I\u2019m happy now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku jerks to grab at the front of his shirt, and Katsuki damn near falls in.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Please!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Katsuki huffs, steading himself. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing your clothes, calm down. Count to twenty, and I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku lets go, and Katsuki stands to go hunt through Izuku\u2019s bedroom. He finds boxers and a t-shirt, which is just about all he\u2019ll be able to wrestle Izuku into right now. Under any other circumstance, he\u2019d keep a sub naked to avoid over-stimulation and promote more skin-on-skin contact, but he\u2019ll have to make do.</p>\n<p>Izuku has just reached twenty when Katsuki comes back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done. Now do exactly as I say.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets Izuku out of the bath and into dry boxers. He tries not to look, holding up the towel \u2013 but he has to keep Izuku upright, and he gets a glance at how <em>badly </em>Izuku\u2019s ass is bruised, and Katsuki feels rage all the way up to his eyes.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re messy bruises. Like the slaps were random. They\u2019re not the marks of a hand, either \u2013 likely a belt, and they\u2019re way too high, not at all where someone should be spanked. This guy was sloppy.</p>\n<p>Katsuki would <em>never </em>make a mark that didn\u2019t have meaning. Each bruise is deliberate and planned like a brush stroke. Izuku just looks like he lost a fight. It <em>disgusts </em>him.</p>\n<p>Izuku wiggles the shirt on, and Katsuki has to refocus himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well done. Now c\u2019mere you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s room is a fuckin\u2019 mess, but Katsuki throws aside shit and clears a space so he can pull Izuku\u2019s head in his lap. Izuku goes like a natural, curls right up on his thighs like he belongs there.</p>\n<p>Katsuki feels shitty, because Izuku would never, under any circumstance, <em>ever </em>do this with him. But this isn\u2019t his Izuku right now \u2013 and Katsuki tries to remember that.</p>\n<p>Katsuki pets through damp hair, twisting the strands around his fingers and creating movements that will be easy to predict and focus on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to come back now, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk you through it,\u201d Katsuki sighs, setting his head back against the headboard. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt at first. Like shining a flashlight in your eyes. But it\u2019ll be warm, real fuckin\u2019 warm. Just walk that way and keep going, I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWarm,\u201d Izuku sighs, and they lay there for a long time. Enough that Katsuki memorizes the posters on Izuku\u2019s wall, so much that he sees them when he closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the calm before the storm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku ends up dozing, and comes to after another half hour. He stirs suddenly, rolling out of Katsuki\u2019s lap and rubbing at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhh god,\u201d Izuku groans. He thumbs over his wrists, then his shoulder, and Katsuki can see that he\u2019s physically feeling again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Katsuki snaps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku jolts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki stares him down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The air conditioner kicks on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Izuku breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuuuck,\u201d Izuku slaps his hands over his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream that up, did I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Katsuki growls, and swings his legs out of bed. \u201cPut on some fuckin\u2019 pants. You\u2019ve got some explaining to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, I\u2026I don\u2019t even know where to begin, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPants!\u201d Katsuki snaps with his fingers, and Izuku groans loudly.</p>\n<p>Katsuki prepares tea in the kitchen, slamming cabinets and rattling the teapot on the stove. His heart is split in two directions \u2013 the hidden side that still wants to coddle and protect, and the self that is <em>livid </em>right now.</p>\n<p>Izuku waddles into the living room, jumping into a pair of sweatpants, and Katsuki crosses his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cName. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just a hookup,\u201d Izuku rubs his eyes. \u201cNobody you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care, give me a fucking name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like that. I just \u2013 I got too into it. It was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t drive home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I took a taxi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat guy sent you home\u00a0<em>in a taxi,</em>\u201d Katsuki shouts, getting louder. \u201c<em>Alone. </em>While you were <em>fucking dropped, </em>Deku!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s face reddens, and he looks at the counter bashfully as he takes a seat at the barstool.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was only my third session with this new guy and um, I should\u2019ve set more boundaries. It\u2019s really no big deal. I\u2019m really sorry you had to see me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNew guy, huh?\u201d Katsuki crosses his arms. \u201cThis is all news to me. Did your old squeeze give you aftercare?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026no,\u201d Izuku scratches his chin, which has gotten a little stubbly this late at night. \u201cI never really needed it. Felt uh \u2013 too personal and <em>ack! </em>Why are we talking about this?!\u201d Izuku presses his face in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause apparently, you\u2019re a moron.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never told me any of this,\u201d Katsuki frowns, pulling off the tea when it screams. \u201cYou tell me everything. You tell me about every new freckle on your ass. You tell me about your <em>pet rock.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cactus,\u201d Izuku frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long have you been into SM?\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh, maybe a year?\u201d Izuku rubs his head. \u201cAnd how would I even tell you?! <em>Hey Kacchan, I like to have my ass slapped in bed \u2013 </em>yeah right, you\u2019d chew me apart.\u201d Izuku blinks. \u201cWell. I thought\u2026you would.\u201d A beat. Katsuki can physically see him put the pieces together. \u201cYou knew what had happened, just from looking at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame coin, different side,\u201d Katsuki sneers. Izuku pales and looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Izuku sets his elbows on the counter, and presses his forehead to his hands. \u201cDamn. For me\u2026it\u2019s just a stress reliever. I like to, um, not think about life for a minute. Please don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d Katsuki says, angrily sliding tea across the counter. \u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 pissed. You just let any asshole out there tie you up? Do you know how dangerous that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scowls, and slams his hand on the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a whore!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let people treat you like one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t! Do you really think I\u2019d do that? I run background checks, I -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 <em>saint. </em>If they let you walk out the door like that, then they\u2019re a pathetic waste of a human not worth your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be babied!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, you do!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flinches. Katsuki\u2019s chest tightens, and he feels sick, fuckin\u2019 <em>sick, </em>because the switch between whatever happened an hour ago and this fight right now \u2013 it hurts his brain. It\u2019s all out of sequence, it\u2019s all <em>wrong. </em></p>\n<p>Izuku breathes in and out, and then folds his hands and bows his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for taking care of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki swallows. He then glowers and jerks his chin away.</p>\n<p>\u201cTch. Don\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, and he fiddles with his fingers around the cup of tea, and the distance between them feels a million miles long. Katsuki\u2019s fingers are still pruney from the water. He can still feel Izuku\u2019s hair in his hands, if he thinks about it.</p>\n<p>Izuku speaks again, and this time it\u2019s infuriatingly soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s heart wrings, but he doesn\u2019t let it show on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be? You think I\u2019m gonna\u2019 look at you different, now?\u201d The look on Izuku\u2019s face tells Katsuki <em>yes, </em>and Katsuki sighs. \u201cDumbass. I\u2019ve seen you do too much stupid shit to be thrown by now.\u201d Another sigh. \u201cAnd obviously, I\u2019m no different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku breathes a laugh out of his nose, and looks up at Katsuki through his eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re a dom. I remember bits and pieces \u2013 you were good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a good master,\u201d Katsuki replies coolly, and Izuku\u2019s eyelashes flutter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Haha. Guess I should\u2019ve known.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been friends for twenty years (minus about five in the middle there). Katsuki has dragged this man back from the brink of death. Izuku has given him CPR three (four) times. They\u2019ve shared hospital beds and cried in each other\u2019s arms and they beat the everliving shit out of each other at least once a year. Katsuki can\u2019t let this person leave \u2013 he\u2019d kill Izuku himself before he ever let him walk out of his life.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s one more layer?</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to anyone else,\u201d Katsuki says, and Izuku\u2019s head snaps up so fast, it\u2019s impressive that it doesn\u2019t fly clean off his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dumped my last sub a month ago,\u201d Katsuki shoves his hands in his pockets. \u201cI can take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you \u2013 are you talking about sex?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? What about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSex with <em>me?!\u201d </em>Izuku points at his chest. \u201c<em>Me?!!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god yes, <em>you, </em>you fucking dumbass,\u201d Katsuki scowls. \u201cDo I gotta\u2019 spell it out for you? Let\u2019s make a contract.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flounders, waving his hands around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-wh \u2013 <em>why?!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBecause <em>obviously </em>you\u2019re too irresponsible to scout doms yourself,\u201d Katsuki hisses. \u201cYou think I\u2019m gonna\u2019 let my hero partner run off and get his ass killed \u2018cause he tried to walk home on a bad drop? Hell no, not while we\u2019re in the top ten.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku frowns. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take care of you,\u201d Katsuki reiterates. \u201cI\u2019ll make it good, better than that sloppy bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room comes to a chilly standstill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows thickly. He rubs absently at his wrists.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I\u2026disgust you?\u201d</p>\n<p>That pisses him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck would I think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re friends,\u201d Katsuki grips the counter from across the bar, and leans closer. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gotta\u2019 be serious, it\u2019s just sex. Tell me one good reason why not \u2013 a <em>good </em>one. I know I\u2019m hot, so don\u2019t lie to my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sinks back and presses his hands to his reddening cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan! This is crazy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? We\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku sighs, and then laughs. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t quite smile, but his eyes squint.</p>\n<p>\u201cSend me your list. I\u2019ll come up with some terms and \u2013 fuck, see if we\u2019re compatible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku snorts and sets his head in his hand. \u201cProbably are, if our history is anything to go by.\u201d He hesitates, and looks up at Katsuki with those big puppy eyes that betray his stature. \u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026promise me if this doesn\u2019t work out, that we\u2019ll still be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve thrown up in my lap before,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cIf anything was gonna\u2019 be the dealbreaker, it was that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologized!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re off whisky for life. Where the fuck do you keep your weed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCookie jar top left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything is about to change.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything is normal on patrol the next day.</p>\n<p>Almost\u2026too normal.</p>\n<p><em> So </em> completely and utterly <em> normal, </em>that towards the end of their shift, Katsuki starts to question if the previous night even happened at all.</p>\n<p>Izuku is at the top of his game today, and it\u2019s pissing Katsuki off. They have a minor altercation with some drug dealers, and Izuku deescalates the situation before they even come to blows. Kind of a blue-baller. Katsuki wanted to break a few teeth, at the least.</p>\n<p>Well \u2013 they\u2019re seasoned at playing good cop bad cop, so when Izuku turns his back, Katsuki gets up in their faces and sneers, popping explosions off his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I find out you\u2019re sellin\u2019 any more drugs to kids, you fucks are gonna\u2019 wish you were never born.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cGive them a break, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku says sweetly, and damn him, he never remembers to use his fucking hero name. \u201cHelp me cuff these guys, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki huffs, but stomps over to help. He <em> swears </em>one of the villains starts to laugh at him, and Izuku is forced to use his black whip to hold Katsuki back, which is satisfying.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoulda\u2019 let me knock a few heads,\u201d Katsuki says later, while undressing in the locker rooms.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re just a crowd that got into some bad business,\u201d Izuku says, pulling off his gloves. \u201cI think they\u2019re good people, deep down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Endeavor can be a dick, but he\u2019s got a nice agency. The faculties are fancy, and Katsuki doesn\u2019t mind mooching off him, or stealing the soaps in the bathroom (shh).</p>\n<p>\u201cTch. You think everyone is <em>good inside</em>. It pisses me off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles at him, and it\u2019s so alarmingly <em> cute </em>that Katsuki ends up throwing his gauntlets into his locker a little too roughly. Something definitely broke, but that\u2019s a future problem.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shaking into a pair of jeans when Izuku approaches him. His face is a little pink, but the look in his eyes is solid with determination.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. This is for you, before I forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises an eyebrow, and looks at the folded piece of paper Izuku is handing him. Katsuki snatches it, and his entire demeanor changes as he registers what it is.</p>\n<p>Alright. So it wasn\u2019t a dream.</p>\n<p>The paper looks like it\u2019s been photocopied \u2014 like Izuku has handed it out before \u2013 and that particular detail makes his mouth burn. <em> But, </em> he\u2019s distracted by the fully detailed kink list, with little checkmarks and handwritten notes like \u2018 <em> yes please\u2019 </em> and \u2018 <em> only if i\u2019m informed beforehand\u2019 </em> and \u2018 <em> absolutely not xx\u2019 </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Katsuki skims the list. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t changed your mind yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. No.\u201d Izuku rubs his hair, which has long been caked in sweat and dirt. He keeps it shorter these days, in an attempt to look more mature for his branding. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve changed <em> yours </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know me. I don\u2019t half-ass shit, <em> Deku. </em> \u201d He grins at some of the kinks checked <em> yes, </em>and then carefully folds the paper and tucks it in his front pocket. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll be getting along.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku quickly turns back and marches to his locker, and the stiffness in his shoulders is also kind of cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay! Good, good good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m free on Friday. Half n\u2019 Half is teaching the interns and I want to be faaar away from this hellhole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, and he looks a little less freaked out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I can do Friday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy house <em> only,\u201d </em>Katsuki points. \u201cI hate your apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care, your neighbors suck and the hallway smells like cheese.\u201d Katsuki throws on a shirt. \u201cBlock out a good few hours, and turn your pager off before you come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flushes again, and he laughs as he ties his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, okay. It\u2019s going to take that long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make that face, nerd. A written list is one thing, but I gotta\u2019 figure some shit out myself.\u201d Katsuki slams his locker shut. \u201cCount it as a trial run.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a thoughtful face. \u201cHmm, well that would make sense. No hard feelings if I don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, but I\u2019m the shit, so that won\u2019t happen,\u201d Katsuki grins, and Izuku rolls his eyes, nosing back into his locker. Katsuki shoves his keys in his back pocket and asks, \u201cBy the way, do you jack off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku damn near falls over. He scrambles upright, blinking rapidly and gaping like a fish.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhhhh. Well, <em> yeah. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d Katsuki says, checking his phone. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna\u2019 have to quit that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki grins, and steps closer. Izuku presses his back to the lockers, and Katsuki stays on the other side of the bench, threatening, but an arm\u2019s length away.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, you thought this would be easy? As of right now, your orgasms belong to <em> me. </em>Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>The heavy swallow in Izuku\u2019s throat is attractive and pleasing. His gaze drops down and up, before looking Katsuki in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSweet,\u201d Katsuki says, and flips his phone around his fingers. \u201cSee you tomorrow, dipshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki has one quick stop before he goes home.</p>\n<p>He cornered one of their techs earlier in the day, and convinced her very kindly to do a little digging for him (only a few minor death threats, nothing to worry your pretty little head over).</p>\n<p>He received the details on his phone thirty minutes ago. IT might\u2019ve been forced to do a little hacking into Izuku\u2019s email \u2014 but it\u2019s for the better good (It was also a relief to find out that Izuku was known only under a code name. At least he\u2019s not a complete moron).</p>\n<p>The roads are empty post rush hour, and Katsuki walks in the streetlights as he detours downtown. He took a taxi partway, and now looks up and down for the specific apartment address. A dog barks behind a chain link fence, and the background noise gets quieter as Katsuki ascends up a stairway.</p>\n<p>The door is old and chipped and has water damage at the corner. The whole place smells like trouble, and it pisses Katsuki off even more.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knocks three hefty times, and it rattles the hinges. When he gets no response, he knocks again; the door flies open quickly. The man is a wolf hybrid, big and grey and intimidating to someone else, maybe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! What the hell do you want? Do you have any idea what time it is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure do,\u201d Katsuki says, and steps forward, up to the line of his door. \u201cI have a delivery for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? You don\u2019t look like amazon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s a message.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grabs him by the front of his shirt, and slams the wolfman up against the outer wall of the apartment. Katsuki gets right in his face, so close he can feel his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing Bunny anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki pins Izuku\u2019s list to the corkboard in his office. He\u2019s definitely got some thinking to do. Just like anything else \u2013 if Katsuki is going to do this, he\u2019s damn well going to do it right.</p>\n<p>This is nothing he can\u2019t handle. Poor Izuku has no idea what he\u2019s in for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is a little grouchy the next day. Katsuki has a few guesses why.</p>\n<p>He corners him in the agency hall and frowns. Izuku has a cute face by nature, but it can look so <em> mean </em>when he scrunches it up like that. Katsuki also knows he has the physical ability to pop Katsuki\u2019s head off his shoulders like a barbie doll \u2014 not that Katsuki is intimidated by that. Just mindful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did something, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, I do lots of shit,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cI\u2019m a busy guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFang-san called and dumped me. He sounded very distressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, don\u2019t need \u2018em anymore, right?\u201d Katsuki flicks Izuku\u2019s nose, and passes him on the way to their office. \u201cC\u2019mon, quit slackin\u2019, there's work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku puts his hands on his firm, round little hips and marches after him, and Katsuki feels smug, so he grins at the intern getting coffee, and nearly scares the shit out of her in the process.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By Thursday, Katsuki texts Izuku a contract. Nothing fancy \u2014 just a refined list of everything he\u2019s willing to perform \u2014 and Izuku gives him the okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game begins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Friday rolls around, and Izuku shows up in a vintage All Might hoodie and donut socks, so, we're off to a great start. Katsuki isn\u2019t nervous because he doesn\u2019t <em> get </em>nervous \u2013 this is old hat by now \u2013 but Izuku looks like a bag of internalized stress, and fuck if that isn\u2019t Izuku in a nutshell anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt smells so nice in here,\u201d Izuku chirps, toeing off his dumb shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, see what happens when you clean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI clean! Just uh \u2013 not like this. How do you find the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make time,\u201d Katsuki says, and leads him through the living room.</p>\n<p>Katsuki bought a townhome the very minute he could afford it, because he hated having neighbors on top of him, and fuck the broken apartment elevator. He takes good care of his place because he\u2019s not a slob, and also \u2018cause he was used to weekly visitors for a while there (if you know you know).</p>\n<p>Izuku might sound relaxed, but Katsuki can see tension from his feet to his damn ears. That\u2019s fine; technically, it will be Katsuki\u2019s job to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tamed worse, anyways. Nothing so personal, but Katsuki can cope. Izuku on the other hand\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cSet your shit wherever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku has never been in his bedroom before (err, not since he moved). Izuku\u2019s eyes immediately snap to his bedposts, and Katsuki watches him nose around, like he\u2019s trying to find out where all the toys are hidden. Katsuki won\u2019t say, because that\u2019s part of the fun.</p>\n<p>Katsuki starts to rummage around in his walk-in closet, and he barks impatiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit already, Jesus. You\u2019re acting like a friggin\u2019 virgin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Izuku forces a smile, and sits on the edge of the bed. \u201cThis is just kinda\u2019\u2026weird, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A raw silence passes. Izuku digs his finger into the carabiner hooked on one of the bedposts.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeez. Is your whole room outfitted for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to find out,\u201d Katsuki sneers. He finds the gloves he was looking for, and tucks them in his back pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re stiff as a board, so we gotta\u2019 fuckin\u2019 talk.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014!\u201d Izuku bites off, and then flounders. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just been a long week, it has nothing to do with <em> you \u2014\u00a0</em>\u201c\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d Katsuki crosses his arms, and Izuku looks up at him, finally. \u201cIf you want to walk out the door right now, I\u2019ll never bring it up again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku actually looks concerned. At least he no longer looks like he\u2019s going to barf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki chews on his tongue, flicks it around in his mouth, and figures he owes Izuku this, at the least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was marked on your list, but I dunno\u2019 if me hitting you is going to be such a good thing, considering our history.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes gloss over, and his voice sounds touched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Kacchan. That was so long ago, please don\u2019t worry about anything like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Izuku is an adult who can handle himself, so Katsuki shrugs and says, \u201cYour call.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. I um, I appreciate that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, let's get a move on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going spell out everything for you, so pay attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks him up and down, and then nods shallowly. Katsuki stares back neutrally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. To start out, you can undress to your comfort level. For today, I won\u2019t take off anything that you don\u2019t remove yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku has the nerve to look surprised. Tch, Katsuki knows he isn't virgin mary, but he's not a <em>complete\u00a0</em>asshole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuki relaxes slightly, \u201cOkay.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me by my name, that\u2019s an obvious one,\u201d Katsuki says, stepping closer. Izuku reaches for his hoodie and pulls it off by the back, but Katsuki can see that his hands are unsteady. \u201cWhat\u2019s your safeword?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. I use the stoplight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Katsuki slides on one glove, and watches Izuku tense even further. They fit snug, without a single wrinkle, perfectly tailored to Katsuki\u2019s hands. \u201cThis will be a skin barrier to help you disconnect. Familiar?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wets his lips nervously, and nods at the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>His head jerks up, and Katsuki scowls at him. \u201cStop freaking out. Trial run, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, and twists his fingers in the hem of his t-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s too tense. Katsuki sighs out of his nose, and steps to close the door and lock it.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku exhales. He presses his hands to his face, breathes in and out, and attempts to level his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I just\u2026can\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that you want to do this with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hmm. Katsuki flicks on the LEDs under his bed, and Izuku startles as the room glows a deep purple.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same as you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Katsuki approaches, and Izuku nervously folds his shirt in his lap. \u201cSome people like to give up control. I like to take it.\u201d Izuku\u2019s breath hitches, and Katsuki stares down at him. \u201cI know you, Deku. You\u2019re stubborn as an ass and you fight me tooth and nail every damn day \u2013 but this ain\u2019t that. We\u2019re not heroes right now. I know you\u2019ll be good, and do exactly as I say, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks out of place on his bed, glowing purple from the neon, his eyes unsteady on the floor. For a moment, he looks years younger. Like the big-eyed, naive little dork that broke bones just to pass class.</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows thickly, his face going through several emotions, before he nods obediently. He ages again, this moment. The surefire gaze of a man who's stood next to him through hell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki internally grins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Got him.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki gestures to Izuku\u2019s state of undress.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> God. </em>The title rolls down Katsuki\u2019s back like a friggin\u2019 chill. He doesn\u2019t let his face show it; instead, he studies Izuku, cross-legged on his bed, shirtless and in dark jeans. Hmmm, Katsuki can make do with this.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hands them over, and Katsuki sets them on his side chair. He doesn\u2019t make any unnecessary motions, doesn\u2019t move out of Izuku\u2019s field of view, doesn\u2019t walk too quickly.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a chance that they won\u2019t be a good matchup; that no matter what, Izuku won\u2019t be able to get out of his head. But Katsuki has too much pride to let that happen, so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach and you\u2019re going to listen, because obviously nobody did you right in the first place,\u201d Katsuki says. Izuku looks like he wants to argue, but he sits on his hands and nods. \u201cGood. Submission is a mental game.\u201d Katsuki stands at the foot of the bed, and gestures for Izuku to slide closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about getting your rocks off \u2013 it\u2019s about <em> going </em>somewhere. About placing a hundred percent of your trust into someone else\u2019s hands.\u201d When Izuku is close enough, Katsuki reaches out and drags two fingers along the line of Izuku\u2019s cheek. His eyelashes flutter, and Katsuki presses his leathery fingerpads into the pressure points on his jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s what you like, right? Tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think,\u201d Izuku agrees, closing his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect, because that\u2019s my job.\u201d Katsuki maps out his nose, his forehead, his ears, like he\u2019s measuring Izuku to see if he\u2019s up to snuff. \u201cI don\u2019t give punishments, I give rewards. Please me, and you\u2019ll be rewarded. Do as I say, and maybe I\u2019ll smack that fat ass of yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s breath comes out uneven and soft and it\u2019s <em> perfect \u2013 </em> just what Katsuki is looking for. He wants Izuku to feel breathless, wants him to give up the tension in his shoulders and let Katsuki just <em> take \u2013 </em>take all that and throw it away.</p>\n<p>The mood has shifted already.</p>\n<p>Izuku is sitting back on his heels, and Katsuki will admit, the idea of such a powerful person kneeling in front of him is attractive. But it\u2019s different, too. This is <em> Izuku, </em>his hero partner, the person he might just hold the highest amount of respect for; and now he has chosen to let Katsuki take the reins. It feels good. It\u2019s what gets Katsuki off.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d Katsuki says. Izuku parts his lips, watching him curiously. Katsuki pets over the shiny swell of his lips, before sticking one gloved finger over his tongue. Izuku makes a surprised <em> mm! </em>sound, and Katsuki hums back. \u201cGood. Do as you\u2019re told, and I\u2019ll be satisfied. You\u2019re safe with me, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The watery look in Izuku\u2019s eyes makes his chest hurt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a bigger game at play here. Deku the <em> hero, </em>the man who fights fires, who breaks bones and sees death on the daily. He\u2019s here, and he wants to be free of that weight, and Katsuki can\u2019t blame him \u2018cause fuck, he\u2019s got his own problems, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pets two fingers deep into Izuku\u2019s mouth. Drags them long and slow. Katsuki pinches his tongue, pulls a little, but gets no verbal response. Izuku is quiet, only gagging softly when Katsuki pets too far. He\u2019s methodical, choosing to rub on the hooks of Izuku\u2019s teeth, and he eventually strokes the roof of his mouth like a dog.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s face is pink, but he dutifully stays still, pretty and shirtless and oh, he\u2019ll look so good when Katsuki is done with him.</p>\n<p>Katsuki fucks his fingers in his mouth, slow and fast like it\u2019s his own cock, and Izuku looked tolerant at first, but now his eyes are squeezed shut, lips stretching to fit three of his fingers, and watching him squirm makes Katsuki feel gratification in his bones.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just my fingers,\u201d Katsuki reminds. \u201cDoes that get you hot already? So <em> easy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a noise in complaint, so Katsuki suddenly shoves his fingers as far as they\u2019ll go, and Izuku\u2019s eyes water heavily; but he takes it, wiggling his tongue between leather. In and out, back and forth, Katsuki hooks his fingers down and peels his mouth open wide. He lets Izuku get used to his presence, lets him adjust to the power shift. Izuku is still tense, but he\u2019s listening.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Katsuki observes, and pulls out. \u201cYour compliance pleases me. Say thank you, Master.\u201d</p>\n<p>Drool slips down Izuku\u2019s chin, but he doesn\u2019t hesitate to look up and say, \u201cThank you, Master.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> He\u2019s fucking perfect, </em>Kastuki thinks, with a little bit of dread. One of the most powerful heroes in the world, vulnerable in his hands.</p>\n<p>Whatever. Katsuki is <em>stronger. </em></p>\n<p>His gloves are slick with drool, so Katsuki holds out his hand and says, \u201cLick them clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku reaches for his wrist, and Katsuki yanks back his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did <em> not </em>say touch me. Apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d Izuku fidgets. Katsuki nods, and gives him his hand back. Izuku has to sit up higher to reach, and he licks like a dog, steady circles around each digit, swallowing spit and the taste of leather, and when Katsuki says <em> good boy, </em>Izuku groans soft in the back of his throat. It\u2019s musical. It makes him hard \u2013 which is a separate revelation. Katsuki didn\u2019t have doubts, but. He didn\u2019t think it would happen so quickly.</p>\n<p>Izuku is surprisingly erotic. Pink tongue, sparkly freckles and deep, feeling eyes. He\u2019s masculine, too \u2013 a fine line of both. Hmmm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done. I want to tie you now, tell me how much you want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want it very badly, sir,\u201d Izuku says, and looks up through those damn eyelashes. \u201cPlease, tie me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee how easy that is? You\u2019ve already earned a reward,\u201d Katsuki says, dragging his wet glove down to the knot in Izuku\u2019s throat. He pushes with his thumb, and Izuku chokes just a little. \u201cDo not move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki steps away to find his red rope. Izuku stays perfect on his knees, staring blankly at the wall, but his eyes are still tracking when Katsuki returns, so that\u2019s good. He doesn\u2019t want to drop him into subspace today \u2013 he just wants to push a few buttons, and see what clicks.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn around with your arms behind your back, wrists together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku follows suit. Katsuki works through a simple knot, winding the rope under Izuku\u2019s armpits, building several layers before threading a large sequence of knots down Izuku\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m binding your arms,\u201d Katsuki explains clearly. \u201cIt pushes out your chest, makes you look very pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s breath catches.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Right. Praise. </em>\n</p>\n<p>He binds his arms tight, testing the hold and the release before he\u2019s satisfied. The muscles in Izuku\u2019s arms are thick, and this position pushes out his pecs and strains the tendons in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cStunning,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks like a <em> treat. </em>His strong, thick pectorals are squished like tits, and his arms are pulled fully behind his back. He\u2019s off balance, which is exactly what Katsuki wanted. Izuku blinks at him, captivated by Katsuki\u2019s unwavering confidence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit on your knees and spread them. Mm, yes \u2013 fuck, you were made for this, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyelashes flutter, but he keeps his chin held up. Katsuki places a finger under his jaw to lift his head higher, then runs it down to his collarbones, watching his skin prick with goosebumps.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster,\u201d Izuku speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, pet<em>?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and chews on his inner cheek. He forces his face neutral again, like he\u2019s trying to look cool for their first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, Master.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Katsuki grabs a nipple and twists, and Izuku doesn\u2019t react, but his eyes light up. \u201cOnly an idiot would tie someone so tight it hurts. The rope isn\u2019t for pain, it\u2019s to put you exactly where I want you.\u201d Katsuki twists harder, aware of Izuku\u2019s pain tolerance, and Izuku grunts a noise. \u201cRemember, <em> I </em>decide if you get rewarded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s list was marked very, very high on the pain meter. Katsuki has a few theories, but he thinks he can manipulate the situation for Izuku to feel more pleasure from less pain. It\u2019s a work in progress, obviously.</p>\n<p>Katsuki studies him further. Izuku is faring well \u2013 they haven\u2019t done much, but he <em> is </em>hard, and that\u2019s something Katsuki is curious about.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a line in the sand, but someone\u2019s gotta\u2019 cross it.</p>\n<p>Even if it\u2019s late in the game, Katsuki will still say it. Izuku has sex appeal, especially now in adulthood. In the back of his mind, he always figured they\u2019d hook up drunk one night and then never talk about it. This is infinitely better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki drags his fingers over the scars on Izuku\u2019s chest. Some are nastier than others - grafted skin, thin lines, some near-invisible and others a raw pink. Skin on skin would be nice, but the gloves are fine. They\u2019re still friends, and there needs to be some boundaries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Izuku says. A moment later. \u201cSafe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku might as well have reached straight into Katsuki\u2019s insides and <em> squeezed. </em>His heart throbs, and he has to chew through the power rush.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki turns on his magic wand, and Izuku startles upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d He gasps, eyes snapping to the vibrator. \u201cTh-that\u2019s \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot your concern, huh baby?\u201d Katsuki presses it right to the bulge in his jeans, and Izuku jolts on his knees. \u201cYou\u2019re just my little toy right now. Pretty, silent, and <em> still.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gets the hint. He bites on his lower lip and screws his eyes shut, but doesn\u2019t make a peep as Katsuki digs the wand against his cock. Katsuki can see him get harder, and he rolls it down to his balls, watching Izuku\u2019s face curiously. He\u2019s straining against the rope in an attempt to stay still, and his lips get redder as he continues to chew on them.</p>\n<p>Katsuki purrs happily, and shoves Izuku back by the chest. Izuku inhales as he lands on his arms, but Katsuki keeps his knees under him. He knows it\u2019s a stretch but he\u2019s also aware that Izuku can do worse, because he\u2019s always been a bendy little fuck. He spreads his knees wider, and the position would be lewd, if it wasn\u2019t for Izuku\u2019s jeans. Still \u2013 Katsuki can see his erection plain as day. So responsive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCute and small,\u201d Katsuki notes, massaging the head lazily with his vibrator. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku scoffs \u2013 and he\u2019s really not that small, but Katsuki teases him further to see if he\u2019ll react. On and off, hard and gentle, he runs the wand up and down his inseam, along his inner thighs, up his bellybutton and against his cock again. He knows it\u2019s torture; he can see it in Izuku\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like that? I\u2019m not even touching you \u2013 you gonna\u2019 cum in your pants, sweetheart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku gasps. \u201cAah, ye-es!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Katsuki says, and turns the wand off. Izuku sags back onto the bed with a groan, and Katsuki presses his gloved hand over his erection and squeezes <em> hard. </em>\u201cI decide these things, not you.\u201d Izuku flinches in pain and squirms uncomfortably, and Katsuki digs his palm in harder, so it hurts. \u201cYou\u2019ve been good, so I\u2019m rewarding you. Say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps and gasps again, off balance with his shoulders drawn back so tight, and he throws his head back on the pillows so <em> nicely. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you! <em> Ah! </em> Thank you!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki lets go. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I love it sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is going alarmingly well. Almost <em> too </em>well. It doesn\u2019t feel like a first session at all. Izuku has fallen into his role easily, and Katsuki feels optimistic about it.</p>\n<p>Katsuki runs his gloved hands up Izuku\u2019s bare chest, now kneeling between his thighs. Izuku twists and squirms from the uncomfortable over-stimulation of scratchy, damp leather. They\u2019ve worked up this far, and Izuku is reacting well. Heavy breathing, sweat at his temple, flushed red and entirely focused on Katsuki\u2019s every move. It makes Katsuki feel fucking powerful.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I want to give you ten strikes. Will you take them for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Immediate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki helps roll Izuku to his stomach, face down ass up. The position will be hard on Izuku\u2019s neck, so Katsuki has to work fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you tell me why, darling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it pleases you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to feel your hands on me,\u201d Izuku chokes. Katsuki purrs, running smooth circles over Izuku\u2019s ass. The denim stretches tight. It won\u2019t hurt as badly through his jeans, but Katsuki made a promise, and he doesn\u2019t want to take this too far anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cCount them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku does, one by one. Katsuki slaps that thick, pert little ass, and watching Izuku shiver and gasp makes him hard as fuck. Katsuki puts his full strength into it, and Izuku takes it, short of breath and rolling with each spank. He tries to rut against the bed \u2013 but Katsuki catches him in the act, and pulls him up on his knees, forcing his cheek to take the full of his weight. Katsuki slaps him hard on his upper thighs as a warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn't permit that.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku squeaks. \u201cAhhhn, nine! Sorry, Master!\u201d</p>\n<p>So eager to please. He\u2019s getting a little louder. It\u2019s sweet, and very tasty.</p>\n<p>Katsuki swats his ass one more time, and the way it <em> jiggles, </em>ugh, what Katsuki wouldn\u2019t give to see it bare right now. But Katsuki completed his anger management; he can be patient.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made me proud,\u201d Katsuki says. He kinda\u2019 wants to jack off into the drain right now, but it\u2019s much worse for Izuku, poor thing throbbing against his zipper. He feels over Izuku\u2019s bound hands with his own, and Izuku squeezes his fingers like a lifeline. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Izuku exhales. \u201cFloaty. Numb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sweet. Katsuki checks his watch, and sees that they\u2019ve hit the hour mark. That\u2019s enough for today.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, baby. I\u2019m going to undo your arms, and then I\u2019m going to roll you to your back, and I want you to soak in that feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a sharp whine in his throat, and it pulls at Katsuki\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut! I\u2026\u201d He wiggles his hips, obviously still hard and aching. \u201cMaster\u2026please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Katsuki pulls the ropes loose and rubs at his muscles to get the blood flow back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a means to an end, this is about how you\u2019re feeling right now. You still feel good, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh...yes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus on <em> that.</em>\u201d Katsuki squeezes his shoulders, and throws the rope off the edge of the bed. He rolls Izuku over and massages his limp wrists, and Izuku looks up at him with bleary eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll finish when I tell you to. You don\u2019t need to worry about anything else while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares a moment longer, before he nods and closes his eyes. Katsuki winds him down slowly, and they stay like this for a while.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s finally quiet enough to hear the white noise of the ceiling fan.</p>\n<p>He takes off his gloves so Izuku can feel his hands, and Izuku makes a happy noise when Katsuki holds his wrist, and then kisses into his palm. He\u2019s curious of where the line is \u2013 what\u2019s too intimate, or too familiar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm\u2026feels nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did good,\u201d Katsuki tells. \u201cYou're a natural. Fuck, who knew.\u201d He pushes his fingers into Izuku\u2019s biceps, drawing out the stress in sweeping motions. Izuku is like putty in his hands, entirely limp and shivering as Katsuki sits up by the headboard and pets into his sweaty hair. Katsuki feels possessiveness in his damn <em> toes, </em>but he keeps a reign on it, for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026amazing at this\u2026\u201d Izuku mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. \u2018Cause I\u2019m the best at everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku opens an eye. Katsuki can tell that he wants to say something, but isn\u2019t sure if he can, so Katsuki nods, \u201cScene\u2019s over, you\u2019re good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d Izuku breathes. He lets Katsuki continue to pet into his hair. It\u2019s probably a touch too intimate for what\u2019s supposed to be <em> casual \u2018sex\u2019, </em>but Katsuki is thorough with all his subs, so he\u2019s definitely going to follow through with his hero partner.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go that hard and, I \u2013 I didn\u2019t even finish,\u201d Izuku flushes. \u201cNormally, I just ask a dom to hit me as hard as they can, and I\u2019ll get off on it. This was\u2026different. It felt so natural.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tch, barbarians. Anger boils in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they ain\u2019t service doms, they\u2019re fuckin\u2019 posers,\u201d Katsuki curses. He kneads his dull fingernails into Izuku\u2019s scalp, and Izuku purrs like a cat. \u201cYou have to keep a balance. Sweet for all the sour \u2013 if you don\u2019t follow through with some downtime, you\u2019re not getting the full experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always knew you\u2019d be good at being rough,\u201d Izuku mumbles. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know you could be so...nice.\u201d His fingers seek out Katsuki\u2019s sweatpants, and twist in the fabric. It\u2019s an innocent reach for comfort; a good sign, and Katsuki allows it. He keeps his tone light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, and it sounds <em> weightless, </em>utterly free, and Katsuki is immediately satisfied knowing he did his job right. Damn right he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. Did you get some good data?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Katsuki nods, and pinches his nose lightly. \u201cInteresting stuff. I won\u2019t go so easy next time, you damn Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Next time. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku perks up and smiles at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, so, that went well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uh, so well, that Katsuki spent the night jerking off in the shower. He didn\u2019t realize how turned on he was until Izuku was waddling out the door, flowery soft and satisfied and a little needy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heh. Good. Katsuki is going to <em> ruin </em> Izuku for anyone else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is back to his annoying, bubbly self come Monday. Katsuki always shrugged it off as Deku being Deku, but now Katsuki can see that maybe there was a pattern in there.</p>\n<p>It kinda\u2019 pisses him off.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, some villain asshole decides to go rampaging down the street, so Katsuki gets to take out some aggression by Howtizer-ing his ass into the pavement. Izuku is always at his back, ping-ponging off the buildings, jumping like a rabbit and kicking the other villain square in the face, and when the crowd of civilians come out to cheer, Katsuki feels smug knowing that their beloved <em>Symbol of Peace </em>checked \u2018yes\u2019 on the asphyxiation box.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014and that\u2019s it for the weather! Stay tuned for our exclusive Primetime interview with Wonder Duo Deku and Ground Zero \u2013\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn that shit off, Suds,\u201d Katsuki grunts, stirring the ice in his drink.</p>\n<p>The bartender, a tall dude with bubbles for hair, rolls his eyes and turns down the volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man, I was watching that,\u201d Eijirou teases, and elbows Katsuki lightly. \u201cWhat crawled in your cereal this morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019, I got the shit kicked out of my shoulder today and I\u2019m fucking sore, so <em>please forgive </em>my lack of patience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou shudders, \u201cUgh, don\u2019t say the word <em>please</em>, it sounds weird coming from you.\u201d He chews on the straw of whatever fruity crap he\u2019s drinking, and looks up at the TV as it replays footage from the earlier fight. The news shows one of their combo moves in slow motion, and Eijirou whistles. \u201cDamn, dude. The way you caught Midoriya in mid air like that\u2026you two are on a different level, lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki sneers, \u201cHaah? Just lately?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! You guys make a sick team! I just mean \u2013 you gotta\u2019 admit, that fight was super smooth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hm. Katsuki knocks back the rest of his drink, and slides the empty glass towards Suds.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku and I are in a weird place right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou looks at him. While he <em>does </em>know what kind of shit Katsuki likes to get into, it still ain\u2019t right to tell him about this new thing with Izuku just yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right? You guys okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out,\u201d Katsuki says, and catches the glass when Suds slides him a second round.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a week of heavy hitters. Fight after fight, it feels like every villain and their fuckin\u2019 uncle decided to come crawling out of the sewers.</p>\n<p>More fights equal more paperwork, and Katsuki already knows it's going to be a long night when Thursday rolls around.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re pros still working under Endeavor\u2019s name, so they have a nice office up on the higher floor of the agency. They share a room; a spacey one, thank fuck, with ceiling to floor windows, and corkboard walls tacked with red string and photographs.</p>\n<p>Izuku is looking a little haggard today, but fuck if Katsuki isn\u2019t the same. Izuku has a bruise on his cheek that is still healing, and he\u2019s wearing a wrist support for the arm he pushed a little too hard yesterday.</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs suddenly, and bonks his forehead with his stack of papers.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodness, I cannot get my head together today.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki slides his gaze across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you have coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking dumbass, you know caffeine fucks with your anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know!\u201d Izuku whines, and slides back in his chair. \u201cI was just tired from the late shift and I thought it would help\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink water, moron,\u201d Katsuki says. He flips his pen around in his fingers, and then stops when Izuku laughs lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki pauses. He thinks a lot about Izuku\u2019s list, these days. Vulnerability is written in that paper\u2013 but his brain fixates on a specific section. The part that checked <em>yes </em>for praise, and <em>no </em>for degradation.</p>\n<p>Is that\u2026his fault?</p>\n<p>Suddenly, his throat is too tight. Izuku yawns, stretches his arms out like a cat and sticks his nose back in his paperwork, but Katsuki\u2019s stomach starts to eat itself over and over.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks up immediately, tired but with his full attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>How does he even say it? Katsuki squeezes the pen in his hand, and fiddles with the clip.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2026 I\u2019m usually just fuckin\u2019 around when I\u2026\u201d Katsuki scowls, and then sits upright. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem with the shit I call you, then you can just man the fuck up and say it to my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks totally lost. Thankfully, he has years of experience dealing with Katsuki, and after a short face journey, he blinks, and then smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Kacchan. You\u2019re thinking about my list, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it upsets you that much\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d Izuku says, and the knot in Katsuki\u2019s chest loosens. It must show on his face, because the damn nerd laughs at him. \u201cKacchan, really. I\u2019ve known you for so long \u2013 if I didn\u2019t have thick skin by now, then I wouldn\u2019t be fit to be a hero.\u201d Izuku plays with the velcro on his wrist, and doesn\u2019t meet Katsuki\u2019s eye. \u201cI guess I just\u2026don\u2019t like being talked to that way in bed. It messes with my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>Katsuki kicks his feet up on his desk and pulls his laptop into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Dunno\u2019 if I could give up calling you <em>nerd.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles, and spins his chair in a circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we going to um \u2013 do another session this weekend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Eager already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got off yet, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan!\u201d Izuku whisper-yells. \u201cThe walls are thin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? Answer the question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. <em>No.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Katsuki says smugly. \u201cCome over Saturday.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks out of the corner of his eye, and watches Izuku straighten up by the shoulders, and jerk his gaze back down to his desk. He mutters continuously for the rest of the evening, and Katsuki chews back the victorious feeling in his mouth.</p>\n<p>Soon.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki spends a lot of his time with Izuku. Most hero work, lunch breaks, the occasional movie night (when something particularly interesting has hit the theaters), and now part of the weekend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fansites are always arguing over Katsuki and Izuku\u2019s partnership. Fans are batshit crazy \u2014 and they act like they know everything about a hero, just from what they see on TV.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Ground Zero should just get a new partner if he hates Deku so much!\u2019\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>They\u2019re fuckin\u2019 stupid, because there is absolutely no way on God\u2019s green earth that Katsuki could spend six days a week in the constant presence of someone he couldn\u2019t stand. Get your eyes checked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Saturday, he tells Izuku to come showered. He shows up with frizzy damp hair, pink cheeks and an eager look on his face, and Katsuki thinks <em>oh, this\u2019ll be fuckin\u2019 fun.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI saw your new magazine,\u201d Izuku bounces, flopping back on his bed. \u201cMister <em>I\u2019ll Never Be a Model, </em>I liked the makeup.\u201d He already looks way more at ease than last time.</p>\n<p>Katsuki scoffs, \u201cShut the hell up, only an idiot would\u2019ve passed up that much cash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was it again?\u201d Izuku poses back on the bed. \u201cOh yeah! <em>Caramel Old Spice.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making me want to be very nice to you,\u201d Katsuki says, and Izuku straightens up as soon as he slides on a glove. Izuku laughs, and then bows his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything changes when he flicks on the neons, and suddenly Izuku is glowing purple and blue. Reverence falls on the room, anticipation and unease. The tension is therapeutic. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long week for both of them. Neither says it, but they\u2019re both excited for this. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lay everything out for you again,\u201d Katsuki says.</p>\n<p>He sets out his supplies on a black towel; leather cuffs, a riding crop, a few straps, cock rings and a silver plug. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got any objections, speak up now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku wets his upper lip, and the sudden look of <em>hunger </em>is attractive.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. Yeah, this is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get into the real sex, now. You\u2019re still down for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares up at him through those effing longass lashes, and the way he looks Katsuki up and down \u2013 for a second, it feels like he\u2019s the meal instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I mean \u2013 yes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn. Well, at least Katsuki doesn\u2019t have to worry about a lack of attraction (not that he was worried, he fucking wasn\u2019t).</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. I want you naked this time. Fold your clothes and sit on your knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows, and follows his instructions. Katsuki doesn\u2019t touch \u2013 just watches as Izuku unbuttons his shirt, then his trousers, and folds them one at a time. He pulls off his socks, and after a moment of hesitation, his briefs. Katsuki doesn\u2019t hide the fact that he\u2019s watching.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s body is toned and strong and striped with scars. Katsuki has seen him naked a million and one times, but this time he doesn\u2019t have to look away.\u00a0Izuku\u2019s cock is soft, but Katsuki thinks its cute. Cut and thick and short, just like the rest of him. He\u2019s shaved, and Katsuki wants to rub his face against his navel, but that\u2019s for another time.</p>\n<p>Katsuki holds out his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, baby. Greet me.\u201d</p>\n<p>With just one petname, it starts.</p>\n<p>Izuku sits up on his knees and kisses at his glove immediately. He\u2019s less hesitant this time. His face is still red \u2013 but he\u2019s willing to meet Katsuki\u2019s eyes, waiting for the next order. When Izuku has licked between each finger, Katsuki wipes his hand off on his cheek, and grips him hard by the chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a nice hello. Let me return the favor. Open wide for me, please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku does, and Katsuki leans over him, hovering like they\u2019re about to kiss (never ever, impossible), and when Izuku looks like he\u2019s about to panic, Katsuki rolls his tongue around his own teeth, and then spits right in Izuku\u2019s mouth. Izuku <em>shudders, </em>closing his lips and swallowing, and Katsuki considers him good and under. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are, taste good baby? We\u2019re going to need that mouth today. I want you to prove yourself to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Izuku whispers eagerly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay still,\u201d Katsuki says, and reaches right between his legs. He grabs his soft cock \u2013 but it hardens almost immediately, and Izuku squeaks a noise behind his clenched teeth. Katsuki pumps him hard, the wet leather torturous and rough. Katsuki reaches for one of the rings, and slides it on to the base. Izuku jerks from the cold metal, and Katsuki clicks a second one around his balls. \u201cPerfect,\u201d Katsuki says, and pulls his hand away. \u201cThis will keep you from finishing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut \u2013 Master,\u201d Izuku objects, and his eyelashes are wet already. \u201cI want to cum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have I told you? Tell me you haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my concern,\u201d Izuku repeats, breathless.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. Now touch yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks confused, but reaches for his cock. Katsuki slaps his hand away, and Izuku startles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes widen, and he extends his palm out when Katsuki asks. He pours lube on Izuku\u2019s fingers, and says, \u201cMake this enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Master,\u201d Izuku lowers his head, ears pink. \u201cI want to please you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will please me. Tell me when you can take four fingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gapes, \u201cFour?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doubting me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. Roll to your stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku turns to his hands and knees. Katsuki forces his shoulders down, and Izuku reaches back and thumbs over his hole. Katsuki spreads his knees wider so he\u2019ll feel the stretch, and forces Izuku to put on a show.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fingers are wide and thick, and the way Izuku moves looks practiced. It makes him hard, and\u00a0Katsuki feels himself twitch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExposed,\u201d Izuku whines, now up to two fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. You exist for my viewing pleasure alone. Do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki works at prepping a few straps while Izuku fingers himself open. Katsuki could sit and watch all damn day, but he has to keep a cool head. Izuku looks overwhelmed already, his neck red and his arm straining at the angle, but this is nothing yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Katsuki says, clicking a strap to the carabiner in his bedpost. \u201cYou look like art.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku presses his face to the pillows, but spreads his fingers wide, eager to please. His hole is puffy and pink and wet and a fucking temptation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you fuck me, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuuuckkk \u2013</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki nearly breaks character, for a second. He grinds his teeth, and squeezes his hand tight into Izuku\u2019s bare thigh. There\u2019s so much <em>muscle </em>here \u2013 especially in this freckled, perky ass. The back of his mind is still reeling over the fact that he gets to touch Japan\u2019s beloved\u00a0<em>Deku</em> like this \u2014 but there\u2019s no time for hesitation right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you make demands, <em>pet</em><em>.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and his fingers pull back to the second knuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t --! Please forgive me. I was only curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more questions.\u201d Katsuki squeezes his ass, prying his cheeks open with his full grip strength so it stings. \u201cDo as I say, and you <em>might </em>be rewarded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Izuku has four fingers in, Katsuki drags the plug up Izuku\u2019s inner thighs, letting him adjust to the feeling of cold silicone. He presses his gloved thumb alongside Izuku\u2019s fingers, and revels in the way he clenches around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, wet and needy, just like I asked. You might be on the road to impressing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s fingers fall back to the bed, and then grip tightly when Katsuki pushes the full plug in.</p>\n<p>\u201cNghh!\u201d Izuku grits, hips shoving backwards \u2013 and Katsuki forces him back with his arm. Katsuki surprises him by flicking the <em>on </em>switch on the vibrator, and Izuku suddenly thrashes, his spine arching gorgeously. Katsuki slams him back down against the sheets, and leans close enough to whisper in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, we can begin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks back at him, eyes wide and excited, and it makes Katsuki yearn for all the lost years they could've been here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will be a fun little game,\u201d Katsuki says, petting over Izuku\u2019s lips. \u201cPlease your Master before your brain loses oxygen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, as his face is already turning red. His head is forced upside down off the side of the bed, arms cuffed to the straps on each post. Izuku\u2019s legs are left free in order to safeword. Katsuki is aware that Izuku could snap the cuffs if he wanted to \u2013 but he\u2019ll be fucking pissed if he does, because these were expensive.</p>\n<p>For a second, a voice in Katsuki\u2019s brain asks <em>are we really about to do this?</em></p>\n<p>He takes one look at Izuku, tied and naked on his bed, and goes <em>fuck yeah, I am.</em></p>\n<p>Katsuki unzips his jeans; it sounds especially obscene, and Izuku groans, his arms pulling at the restraints. Katsuki has long been hard, and he drags his cock along Izuku\u2019s cheeks, the left then the right, not quite meeting his lips yet, grinding against him like an object, not a man.</p>\n<p>\u201cWider. Yes \u2013 aren\u2019t you a sweet little toy. That surprised look on your face is very cute.\u201d Katsuki pushes against his lips, and Izuku doesn\u2019t fight him, licking eagerly from this strange angle. \u201c<em>Fuck yes, </em>just like that. Focus on breathing, don\u2019t choke just yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>The command is difficult because upside-down like this, Izuku doesn\u2019t have much of a choice but <em>to </em>choke. Katsuki slams his hips forward, and Izuku gurgles, feet pushing up the sheets in the bed as he bucks \u2013 and Katsuki grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep squirming. That vibe is hitting your spot, isn\u2019t it? You won\u2019t be able to cum with those rings on, silly boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku whines in complaint, and Katsuki starts to fuck his mouth in earnest. Izuku\u2019s face is glowing red from the bloodrush, but Katsuki is keeping track of the time. He knows how long he can push before it\u2019s too dangerous. Izuku doesn\u2019t know that \u2013 so the longer Katsuki fucks his mouth, the more desperate Izuku gets. He gags when Katsuki hits his throat, and Katsuki laughs at him, pulling out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, poor thing. I really thought you could do better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku rasps, broken and gritty. His tone is desperate. \u201cSir, <em>please, </em>I can take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki reaches down and holds him by the throat. Izuku inhales raspy, but Katsuki doesn\u2019t squeeze; just holds, like a comfort as he fucks his mouth again, this time in steady, predictable thrusts. Izuku\u2019s lips are wet and sticky and his mouth is <em>hot, </em>and Katsuki feels himself throb at the broken, needy sounds Izuku is making. He drags his wet cock back across his cheeks, and forces Izuku to suffer more headrush. This is about Izuku placing his trust in him, Katsuki can\u2019t forget that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that it? I thought you wanted to impress me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku begs in broken gasps, and Katsuki wipes away his tears.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAh! Ngh! Puh-please!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo please Master!\u201d Izuku cries. His arms flex in the cuffs, and for a moment, Katsuki fears for the integrity of his bedpost, but Izuku reigns in control and bucks his hips, cock leaking all over his stomach. Buzzing fills the air with white noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeg for it,\u201d Katsuki demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do it, please \u2013 let me suck your cock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki is pretty helpless against that one. He pries Izuku\u2019s lips back open and starts thrusting into his mouth again, and Izuku <em>moans, </em>like he\u2019s the one getting his dick sucked, and that\u2019s exactly what Katsuki wanted to hear. His tongue rubs the topside of his cock and Katsuki hits it so deep his balls slap his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, <em>fuck, </em>you feel so good,\u201d Katsuki grits. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me so happy, sweetheart. I\u2019m going to squeeze your throat in five second increments. Don\u2019t stop sucking me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Water rolls down Izuku\u2019s cheeks, but he nods eagerly. Katsuki holds down his throat and applies pressure very carefully, and Izuku\u2019s face gets redder, if possible. He\u2019s on a time restraint here \u2013 but Izuku is clever with that tongue of his \u2013 and watching Izuku\u2019s eyes roll back in pleasure is enough to get Katsuki off, alone. It tingles in his spine, his stomach, his toes; <em>I made you like this. Me, and no one else.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Each second feels like an hour. One. Two. Three. Four. Five.</p>\n<p>Katsuki lets go. Izuku inhales loudly through his nose, and his cock drools all over his bellybutton. Katsuki feels the rush of adrenaline; powerful and better than any high. Izuku looks wrecked already, and it\u2019s <em>art, </em>it\u2019s fucking art.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit. Very good,\u201d Katsuki pets his face with his free hand, thrusting shallowly against his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m close. Can you take one more squeeze?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku kicks the headboard once. That\u2019s a yes.</p>\n<p>Katsuki plugs his mouth and squeezes his throat, counting aloud. Izuku chokes around his cock, gargles spit down the side of his lips, flexes at the cuffs and lets go, thrusts his hips and squirms, and when Katsuki releases he\u2019s over the edge already, just from watching Izuku cry big, heavy sobs. He pulls out to paint white stripes across his wet cheeks, and Izuku moans from it, moans like he\u2019s the one getting off, his little toes twisting and curling in the sheets.</p>\n<p>\"Fuck,\u201d Katsuki exhales, tingling up his spine. It hits him so hard it damn well hurts, and Izuku\u2019s face is almost purple, but he looks absolutely enamored, eyes wide and not leaving Katsuki\u2019s face. Katsuki feels completely winded. \u201cGood job baby, good fucking job, that <em>mouth </em>of yours, my god. You won darling, I\u2019m so fucking proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku throbs harder, and Katsuki helps him sit upright, undoing the clips on the cuffs and pushing him up to his knees. Izuku nearly falls face forward, and Katsuki catches him with an arm around his waist, sitting up behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. We need to sit upright, need to get all that blood back into your heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hiccups, \u201cSir, please. My ass \u2013 I can\u2019t \u2013 it won\u2019t <em>stop.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Katsuki sooths, rubbing his hands up and down Izuku\u2019s sweaty chest. \u201cYou can take it, I believe in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku knocks his head back against his shoulder and cries. His cock twitches and throbs but gets nowhere, and Katsuki keeps petting him, until his face is a healthy shade of pink. He pushes Izuku up enough to click off the vibrator, and Izuku sags in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve pleased me, slave. Do you want your reward?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hesitates. Katsuki keeps petting him, and waits. He knows that he\u2019s overwhelmed right now, so he won\u2019t be upset if Izuku is unwilling to continue. Katsuki is in control, but Izuku is the one calling the shots. It\u2019s important that Izuku remembers that.</p>\n<p>A moment passes. Izuku swallows, clears his throat, wipes his eyes on his shoulder and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy. Stand up off the bed, hands on the mattress please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is wobbly, but manages to do as he\u2019s told. Katsuki wouldn\u2019t push another sub to move so soon, but this case is different, because Katsuki <em>knows </em>Izuku\u2019s limits. He knows how far this body can go, how much it can take, and sure enough, Izuku is steady as a rock as he bends over and plants his hands on the bed.</p>\n<p>The plug is still sitting pretty between his cheeks, and Katsuki gently pulls it out. Izuku groans, but Katsuki ignores him as he sets it aside on the bed and grabs his riding crop. He wants to feel skin on skin - to taste sweat and lick down his spine - but he can't. Not now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy this prize,\u201d Katsuki says, dragging the end up Izuku\u2019s sculptured back. He lightly taps Izuku\u2019s left cheek, then his right. \u201cI will give you three lashes, and then a thirty second break, and then three again. Do you want them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku croaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it pleases you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Katsuki plans out his strokes lightly, deciding exactly where he wants the lines to be. Izuku\u2019s ass is like a sculpture \u2013 and Katsuki wants this to be exactly right. \u201cI care about your happiness. Will this make you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes yes yes, sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2019ll hurt. Clench your teeth, and don\u2019t bite your tongue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki cracks the first one along his left cheek. Izuku jerks, crying out and then moaning from the heat. Katsuki is a big guy, and he\u2019s mostly upper-body strength these days, so he knows the full force of his hits can be excruciating, if Katsuki doesn't prepared the receiver right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki gives a second strike with the crop, alternating to the other side, and then one last one right at the top of his thighs, where he\u2019ll feel it for a few days. He's building him up further - pushing his limits <em>just </em>to skim the edge of what feels impossible. Izuku bites into his hands and screams, and Katsuki pets over the welts with his glove, soothing the pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh, you're okay. You\u2019ll look so beautiful when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku wipes his eyes and sniffs, \u201cI will?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d Katsuki continues to keep time in his head, rubbing the burn away. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, will you let me count three more?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is a mess. Dark hair stuck to his forehead, his muscles straining to\u00a0<em>obey.\u00a0</em>But he gives it up easily. He gives it all to Katsuki - his beloved\u00a0<em>Kacchan.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>It's a power rush. It's a hard drug, and it hits hard when Izuku says,</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t hesitate, because that would make it worse. Izuku is at a pinnacle right now \u2013 and Katsuki needs to see him through it.</p>\n<p>Instead he deals out the last three lashes quickly, one after the other, right where he initially planned. He purposefully breaks the skin on the last one, but it isn\u2019t deep, just puffy and aggravated, and he looks fucking <em>amazing \u2013 </em>enough for Katsuki to get hard again.</p>\n<p>Izuku is babbling into his fingers, hiccupping and crying, having long forgotten about his weeping cock, and Katsuki drops down to kiss the puffy red skin on his ass cheek. It\u2019s so hot against his mouth. Incredible.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished. Well done, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs happily. Katsuki helps him roll to his side, and Izuku pants as he tries to catch his breath. He\u2019s sticky all over, sweaty and flushed, and Katsuki\u2019s heart suddenly hurts for him.</p>\n<p>He rips off his gloves, and allows Izuku to feel bare skin. Izuku utterly <em>curls </em>into his hand, pulls it to his cheek and sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Katsuki blurts. He winces, then says, \u201cUh, how do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, so good. I can\u2019t even \u2013 there aren\u2019t the right words to say. I\u2019m floating. Thank you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki puffs up with pride. His Izuku has done so well, exactly as he asked and \u2013</p>\n<p>\n<em>His?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki swallows thickly. The possessiveness in his chest has him leaning down to nose against Izuku\u2019s cheek, kissing his forehead lightly and breathing in his scent. He smells like electric storms and salty sweat, just like he always has.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never admit it, but Katsuki needs the cooldown just the same \u2014 if not more \u2014 than his partner does. It burns him from the inside out, this overwhelming desire to soothe and protect \u2014 like he might die if he doesn\u2019t get the chance. It\u2019s a momentary lapse in control, a moment of weakness that he hates more than anything, but is powerless to stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku does. His eyes are clear \u2013 so he hasn\u2019t dropped. Good, good. He <em>does </em>look like a well-fed cat, however; spread out and bone tired, and a little flustered from Katsuki\u2019s attention. Katsuki noses again at his other temple, and Izuku tries to curl away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh huh,\u201d Katsuki clicks his tongue. Izuku giggles and rolls to his back, but flinches at the soreness.\u00a0 Katsuki sits back to look at him. \u201cHey, careful. Lay on your stomach, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes are puffy, and they grow big and nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki's voice comes out more hoarse than he'd like. \u201cYeah. Count it out, twenty seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods. Katsuki slips out of bed and jogs into the bathroom. He wets a hand towel and digs for his jar of ointment, and Izuku is laying on his stomach when Katsuki comes back. The lines on his ass are more prominent now \u2013 but no blood, meaning Katsuki did his job right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to treat this,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cThat okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can call me Katsuki,\u201d he says, and then pauses. \u201cOr uh. Fuckin\u2019 Kacchan, or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku mumbles into the pillow, hugging it in his arms. \u201cI feel good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki wipes him down, and then gently massages the sore spots with balm. Izuku doesn\u2019t flinch \u2014 a testament to how strong this guy is \u2013 but he makes a happy humming sound that settles deep in Katsuki\u2019s bones.</p>\n<p>He massages up Izuku\u2019s back, dragging out any tension that might be left. He\u2019s all muscle and healthy fat, built as a killing machine, yet soft and sweet and so fucking gentle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>When did you become so cute?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can see Izuku drifting a little, so Katsuki kneads at the back of his skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get in your head. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels like I finished,\u201d Izuku mumbles. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause I know what the fuck I\u2019m doing,\u201d Katsuki says lightly. He presses his mouth to the knobs at the back of Izuku\u2019s neck, and Izuku breaks out in goosebumps. His shivers, and his voice sounds wobbly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Thank you. I needed this.\u201d</p>\n<p>So did he, but Katsuki doesn\u2019t want to admit that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku turns his head the other way in the pillows, and his ears are pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to touch you so bad. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot weird,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the process. You can touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku carefully rolls to his back, and extends a hand. His hands are thicker than Katsuki\u2019s, shorter and rougher, and Katsuki takes it. Izuku feels around his wrist, up his bare arm and then tugs. Katsuki humors him, lying down at his side and pulling Izuku close to him. Izuku is still a little stiff and nervous, so Katsuki reminds him, \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d and Izuku breaks like a dam.</p>\n<p>He rolls right into his arms, digs his face in Katsuki\u2019s firm chest and holds onto the back of his shirt. His skin is sensitive, so Katsuki is mindful of where they\u2019re touching.</p>\n<p>Izuku breathes in and out, and holding him like this \u2013 his damn heart beats too fast. Almost out of control, and for a moment, Katsuki feels like he\u2019s lost his grip on the whole situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell amazing,\u201d Izuku whispers.</p>\n<p>The clinginess is just a side effect, Katsuki reminds himself. He\u2019s got this. It\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>He pets Izuku\u2019s hair in silence, and lets him ride out the rest of his high. Katsuki takes the rings off when he\u2019s gone soft again, and watching Izuku shiver and cling to him does something terrible to his insides.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I'm weak</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you guys are on,\u201d Denki says, lifting his visor. \u201cBut you should keep smoking it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Dunceface,\u201d Katsuki pops a small explosion to land upright without breaking the concrete. \u201cAnyone left?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Mina waves, kneeling on the back of a downed villain. \u201cYou two cleaned up pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>This part of the street is smoking, but in one piece, more or less. The smell of burnt rubber is still nasty as hell. Katsuki could\u2019ve easily handled the threat on his own, but you know how extras are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku lands next, a few bunny hops before the dust settles. He wipes his gloves off on his pants and grins, \u201cHey, that wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, at this rate, you two are gonna\u2019 take the top spot before me,\u201d Denki whines.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one on crack if you think <em> your ass</em> stands a chance at Number One,\u201d Katsuki growls. Denki raises his hands in surrender. Izuku pats Katsuki\u2019s back in consolation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere there. Is your hand okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki sighs, and shows him his palm anyways, where his glove is ripped down the middle. It\u2019s bleeding sluggishly \u2014 he won\u2019t even need a healer. Izuku studies the wound and hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEffin\u2019 told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Denki makes a stupid face, like he can\u2019t believe Katsuki just let Izuku live.</p>\n<p>\u201cKyokaaa, how come you never check my wounds like that?\u201d Denki whines.</p>\n<p>Jirou dusts off her hands and huffs, standing up from the rubble.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t love you that much, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, and steps away from Katsuki with forced casualness, and Katsuki glares holes into the side of Denki\u2019s dumb head.</p>\n<p>Another explosion ricochets down the street, and they\u2019re off again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have a rough start to the week \u2013 and not the good kind. The media decided to drill into them about the collateral on one of their more recent fights, and they\u2019re all feeling the pressure from it, god damn it. Katsuki knows they\u2019re in deep water when their annoying manager gets involved in damage control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku always pushes forwards, even when he\u2019s got one foot in the grave. He looks tired, and he definitely hasn\u2019t eaten, because Katsuki watched him skip lunch to go help old ladies or some shit, and Katsuki can tell he\u2019s running on fumes by the time they\u2019re changing out of uniform.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi,\u201d Katsuki calls, and Izuku blinks up at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got soap in your hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku feels over his damp hair, and towels off the rest. He gives that stupid smile \u2013 the one that\u2019s posted all over the billboards. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not what Katsuki was originally going to say. He sits to tie on his boots, and sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cLemme\u2019 buy you dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks like a confused puppy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhataya\u2019 mean <em> huh??</em>\u201d Katsuki barks. \u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 dinner, I know you damn well don\u2019t have any food at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku coughs, so a bullseye, obviously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right I don\u2019t have to<em>.</em>\u201d Katsuki slaps him hard between the shoulder blades, and Izuku grunts. \u201cI bet Konos is still open.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKonos is always open.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is reminded of their height difference when they walk side by side like this. Yeah yeah, Izuku can kick ass, but at least Katsuki still won in size (ha, loser).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has a talent for hiding his strong stature behind big sweatshirts. Katsuki knows he has a bad rep for never wearing a belt, but come on, at least his shirts fit. Izuku looks snuggly, but the cuteness is overshadowed by the damn <em> Icyhot </em>colors split down the middle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell are you wearing this?\u201d Katsuki yanks on his hood, and Izuku fakes a choking sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! I like this hoodie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy series was way cooler,\u201d Katsuki snuffs, and Izuku laughs at him, sticking his hands back in the kangaroo pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, are you jealous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, <em> no. </em>I\u2019m just saying you have no taste.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku hums, and his little nose is pink from the cold, and he looks up at him through his lashes and it\u2019s like Katsuki is transported into last week, where Izuku was melted and sticky in his hands, and Katsuki has to force himself back into the present.</p>\n<p>He yanks open the door for him; Izuku mumbles <em> thank you, </em>and they take their usual seat in the back by the giant houseplant. It\u2019s usually just third-shifters this late at night, and the waitress already knows their orders.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s with this?\u201d Izuku stirs his sweet tea, which is a disgrace, by the way, because Izuku always adds more sugar. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been here in a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugs; he leans back in the chair and crosses an ankle over his knee. They\u2019re hidden by the bigass plant, so Katsuki isn\u2019t worried about being recognized.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had our asses handed to us this week, so I wanted to check in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every once in a while, Izuku looks at him like he\u2019s a total stranger. Katsuki thinks that he\u2019s seeing the old him. The one that said things that Katsuki wishes he could take back, chew up and swallow. They\u2019re past that, Izuku doesn\u2019t even <em> care, </em>but sometimes he\u2019s surprised when Katsuki does.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026okay,\u201d Izuku settles. \u201cSome stuff has been overwhelming, but it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWork stuff,\u201d Katsuki raises an eyebrow. \u201cOr <em> our </em>stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks around the restaurant, like he\u2019s checking to see if he\u2019ll be overheard. He pinches his straw, and sips quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth, I guess.\u201d Katsuki waits to see if he\u2019ll continue, and Izuku does. \u201cOur um \u2013 <em> sessions. </em>They\u2019ve been good for me. I come out thinking clearer than before. It\u2019s like getting a full body massage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s chest vibrates with satisfaction, but he keeps his face blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, still sore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always sore,\u201d Izuku smiles, and Katsuki feels it go right through him. \u201cThis is the good kind. They\u2019re just bruises now, god knows I have enough of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki nods, and plays with one of the sugar packets on the table, flipping it between his fingers like a pen. He suddenly wants to see them; the yellowish bruises healing on his backside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lighting is blue and red in here; Izuku glows like the neon in his bedroom, and that\u2019s a thought he can\u2019t follow.</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs nervously, and rubs his nose. \u201cI know this is probably weird to say but \u2013 you\u2019re like an entirely different person in there. I don\u2019t know how you pull it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugs, \u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you? I don\u2019t have to worry about shit in a scene \u2013 I don\u2019t even have to think about bein\u2019 myself. S\u2019 good for me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku seems to light up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat \u2013 that makes me relieved to hear. I\u2019ve kinda\u2019 felt\u2026bad. Like I\u2019m the only one receiving.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s definitely <em> not </em>what\u2019s been happening, but interesting to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously not, \u2018cause you sucked me dry last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and jumps across the table to flatten a hand to his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan! Seriously!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rips his hand off and shoves Izuku back down into his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one can hear, stupid!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThey can if you shout like that!\u201d Izuku whisper yells, and sinks down in his chair. He rubs at his red face, but exhales steadily, and steers his voice level. \u201cI guess I was just trying to say that \u2013 I enjoyed myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Katsuki more relieved than he\u2019d like to admit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hey, this friends-with-benefits shit is easy peasy. Why the hell is dunce-head always complaining about it so much?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you wanna\u2019 keep going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares, and then grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Thanks for being so patient with me. I can\u2019t help but feel spoiled, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>The look Izuku is giving him feels a touch too intimate for <em>just</em> <em>friends, </em>but Katsuki won\u2019t let himself fall down that rabbit hole, no fucking sir. Katsuki kicks him from under the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbass, go get your head checked.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t afraid to laugh and kick him back, and the waitress comes with their food saying, \u201cNow now, boys. I can\u2019t be patching up any more holes in our walls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201c--in other news, stay tuned for our exclusive play by play footage of the Wonder Duo\u2019s smackdown in Nara \u2013\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSuds!\u201d Katsuki snaps, and the bartender is already turning it down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrooo, relax,\u201d Eijirou digs into his shoulder with his hand. The damn guy is strong, and Katsuki grunts as he hits a muscle. \u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re like a bag of rocks. You feel like <em> me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHands off, shitty hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou doesn\u2019t stop, but Katsuki is too tired to fight him (tell anyone he said that and he\u2019ll kill you).</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man, if something is bothering you, you can tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah yeah, Katsuki knows. Eijirou is probably the only dumbass on this planet <em> other </em>than Izuku that Katsuki would trust to like, tell his feelings to or what the fuck ever. And seeing as Izuku is obviously out of the question right now\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ever slept with a friend?\u201d Katsuki asks. Eijirou\u2019s eyes snap wide open, and he looks like he\u2019s about to make a scene, but he quickly reels himself in, and pulls away his hand just in case.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, dude. Yeah. Did something happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019 bad,\u201d Katsuki fits his head in his hand, and watches the TV. \u201cJust different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou stares. His hair is long, but he buzzes the underside, and he looks even more wild than in their highschool years. Katsuki is probably no different, because everyone says he looks scary no matter how short Katsuki cuts his hair. His manager calls it <em> branding. </em>Katsuki calls it a waste of his goddamn time.</p>\n<p>\u201cChange can be good,\u201d Eijirou offers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cChange can kill you,\u201d Katsuki replies, and they both take a shot together, tapping their glass upside down on the bar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a time bomb, the week gets worse before it gets better.</p>\n<p>Katsuki would really prefer to be out doing field work, but it\u2019s their office day \u2013 and after four straight hours Katsuki is going to <em> kill </em>Izuku in cold blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop clicking your pen I\u2019m going to hurl you into the sun,\u201d Katsuki hisses. Izuku pauses, and clicks his pen <em> one </em>last time before setting it down slowly on his desk. Katsuki\u2019s temple throbs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki goes back to reading through bullshit, and he\u2019s not sure how much time passes, but it ain\u2019t long enough. He notices his desk shaking slightly.</p>\n<p>Izuku is bouncing his leg, attempting to focus but cannot <em> sit still. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, I swear to god.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stops. He looks a little sheepish as he slides down in his chair, and pulls his laptop closer. Katsuki breathes in and out. He\u2019d ditch, but this shit really needs to get done, because uh, a chunk of his weekends are now busy again. Not that it\u2019s a problem, it just is what it is.</p>\n<p>Five minutes later, when Izuku begins to squeak his chair back and forth, Katsuki\u2019s lid finally pops.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to find the intern that gave you caffeine and <em> skin them alive \u2013\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no, wait!\u201d Izuku stands up after him, setting out his hands like Katsuki is a wild dog. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any coffee!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what the <em> fuck </em>is your problem?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing! I\u2019m just trying to focus!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell sit the hell down and <em> shut up!\u201d </em>Katsuki barks back, and to his own surprise, Izuku follows his command immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki squints. He slowly sits back in his chair, and watches as Izuku stares down at his computer, ears burning.</p>\n<p>Weird\u2026but okay.</p>\n<p>Katsuki is able to get a good chunk of work done in the quiet thirty minutes that follow. It becomes\u2026<em> too </em>quiet, and Katsuki looks back over to check on Izuku. He\u2019s still working, but he\u2019s stiff and sweating, and honestly, he doesn\u2019t look too hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Katsuki snaps. Izuku jerks his head up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku blinks his dumb little eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki looks him up and down. Izuku shifts, fwapping his pen against his lips, and then stops when he notices the repetitive noise, trying to focus back in on his work. Katsuki\u2019s seen that look on his face before \u2013 but only recently, and it raises his suspicions.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, stand up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku does without question\u2013 and then he looks embarrassed about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, why am I standing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Katsuki sighs, and leans back in his chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is confused, but he crosses the distance between their desks without asking why. Katsuki doesn\u2019t like it. Sure, it\u2019s fun to boss him around in the bedroom, but it\u2019s just <em> weird </em>to see Izuku so compliant in broad daylight. Something\u2019s up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, spit it out. You can\u2019t blow smoke up my ass without me knowin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku lets out a breath. He looks to the closed office door, and then circles his finger around the corner of Katsuki\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think you could\u2026well. Just for a minute \u2013 real fast \u2013 just. Um.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, come on<em> .</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me to do something,\u201d Izuku begs. \u201cAnything, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, we\u2019re not doing that shit right now. I\u2019m just Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku whines. \u201cBut this week \u2013 my head\u2019s been all effed up. I can\u2019t think right, and my brain is always super clear after you boss me around so I was hoping just \u2013 we can lock the door \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <em> not </em>fucking in our office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Deku.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku huffs, and leans his butt up against the edge of his desk, crossing his arms tightly. The motion pulls at his jumpsuit, and it\u2019s way too much of a temptation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease? I want to get my work done but all I can think about right now is <em> you.</em>\u201d Izuku says it, and then goes red, like the words hadn\u2019t processed yet. \u201cI mean! I haven\u2019t broken any rules and the d-denial has been difficult and I k-keep getting <em> hard </em> all the time and <em> agh! </em> I\u2019m going to stop talking now.\u201d Izuku bites his lip.</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to learn to self soothe. If I sweep in whenever you get like this, it could fuck with you mentally. I ain't gonna\u2019 let this screw up our careers \u2014 our sessions are <em> strictly </em>once a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks genuinely upset. It tugs at the part of Katsuki\u2019s soul that wants to please and hold.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. I get it \u2013 sorry I asked. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki knows exactly what is wrong with him. <em> He\u2019s </em> the one that\u2019s been conditioning Izuku, sculpting their scenes a specific way, leaving Izuku needy and hard for a reason. He just wants to push him a <em> little </em>further. Just wants to see his breaking point \u2013 and from the way Izuku is fidgeting, obviously turned on and distracted \u2013 it looks like Izuku is almost there.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t sit well to have Izuku just slump back to his desk. But there needs to be a fine line between what happens in Katsuki\u2019s bedroom, and their work life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Katsuki jerks Izuku to stand between his legs. He goes so easy, and the way their hero costumes bump and grind is oddly erotic. Izuku yelps, and Katsuki reaches up to drag Izuku\u2019s head down by his hood. Katsuki speaks against his ear, firm and lowered so no one will hear his voice carry from under the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go back to your desk, and you\u2019re going to finish your work like a good boy, because I told you so.\u201d Katsuki rubs the heel of his hand between Izuku\u2019s legs, and he nearly buckles, arms shooting out to brace himself on Katsuki\u2019s chair. \u201cThen,\u201d Katsuki purrs, \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend the rest of the night thinking about how good it\u2019s going to feel to finally come on my cock this weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>The little gasp from Izuku is so satisfying. He looks needy, like he could make the switch at any second, and <em> fuck </em>if that isn\u2019t a sight to see in full Deku costume.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t lie about that. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki grins, now running softer, more teasing circles against Izuku\u2019s erection.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right? You want me to stuff you that badly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku chews on his cheek, but his response is surprisingly straightforward. \u201c<em>Yeah.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck, they <em> can\u2019t </em> do this in their freaking office, holy shit \u2013 Katsuki\u2019s patience is so fucking thin right now, and his brain shows him vividly how nice Izuku would look spread over his desk and <em> no. </em>No no no. Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>Katsuki gives him a firm slap on the hip, and points to Izuku\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour feedback is appreciated. Now go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku looks a little dazed, but he resumes his work without any more fidgeting for the rest of the night, so Katsuki considers the situation officially handled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Katsuki was momentarily worried that Izuku wouldn\u2019t be able to handle this double (triple?) life they\u2019re living \u2014 well, his doubts are gone by the next day. If anything, Katsuki thinks he might\u2019ve thrown gas on the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is back to arguing with him over every fuckin\u2019 crack in the road, and as much as it pisses him off, Katsuki enjoys it equally so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what I saw!\u201d Izuku hisses, chest pressed flat to the building roof. \u201cSix in the back, two guarding the front door.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m <em> telling you </em>we can take them!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if they attack the hostages?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey won\u2019t, because I\u2019m gonna\u2019 kill \u2018em all before that happens.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done with this \u2014 we\u2019re going through the roof!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No, dipshit,\u00a0 </em>we\u2019re going through the front door!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why we get busted up so much!\u201d Izuku whisper-yells, \u201cBecause you can\u2019t control your massive ego!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a distant <em> oooooooh </em>in his earpiece from the squad. Katsuki rips his out in frustration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you have the espionage skills of a fucking elephant! I\u2019m not going through with a plan that won\u2019t <em> work, </em>you stupid son of a bitch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and the voices come in muffled and quiet through his yanked-out ear piece.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cCome on guys, we\u2019re running out of time here.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cGround Zero, just go with Deku\u2019s plan, Jesus Christ.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHahaha, this feels like old times.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki breathes out of his nose like a bull. Izuku gets a satisfied look on his face, and phones in, \u201cAlright, we\u2019re going through the roof.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They set off the alarm, and end up fighting everyone head-on anyways, just like Katuski said they would. Although, Katsuki <em> will </em>say, they had a better vantage point to grab the hostages and yank them to safety, but Katsuki will take that admission to the grave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a moron,\u201d Katsuki huffs, wiping soot from his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it kill you to be a little nicer to him?\u201d Sero laughs, slapping him on the back. \u201cDeku\u2019s such a sweet guy. You\u2019re the only person that can piss him off that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Mina agrees. \u201cYou guys are <em> the wonder duo! </em>Stop being such a meanie.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pfft. Katsuki looks across the road, where Izuku is getting his forehead dabbed with a swab. He meets Katsuki\u2019s gaze and sticks out his tongue, and Katsuki rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t think that nerd can handle himself, then you need to get your head checked.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki probably had it coming, considering their argument at work \u2014 but it still surprises him so badly, that he drops his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He made a massive beef bowl last night, so Katsuki is heating up leftovers when his phone buzzes. He pats around his pockets, and puts his spoon in his mouth to wipe his hands off on his apron before unlocking his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a text from Izuku that just says <em> &gt;[See Attachment] </em></p>\n<p>The photo opens, and Katsuki ends up fumbling both the spoon and his phone; he barely saves himself a shattered screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A second text goes <em> ding~ </em>all sweet and innocent like.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> &gt; kinda sad they\u2019re almost gone (\u00b4\uff9f\u03c9\uff9f\uff40) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cutesy way that Izuku texts always ticks him off \u2014 especially now, that little <em> brat.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The photo is of Izuku in the bathroom mirror. It\u2019s foggy, like he just got out of the shower, and the way he\u2019s posed shows off the perfect curve of his ass, speckled yellow and purple with old bruises. He\u2019s <em> naked, </em>covering his face with a little heart sticker, like he doesn\u2019t have one of the best bodies Katsuki has ever seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s ass has healed <em> perfectly \u2014 </em> way better than Katsuki could\u2019ve dreamed of. He can still see the crop lines across his thighs, and Katsuki\u2019s mouth waters with the desperation to <em> bite.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki has a million emotions running through his head, but the distant, rational part of his brain notes that this is a big step for Izuku. He\u2019s becoming more confident. Katsuki wants him to feel comfortable, but also...isn\u2019t this a little too casual?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe this is how Izuku interacted with doms in the past. Katsuki scowls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is still waiting for a response, so Katsuki types back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> ur a fukin tease &lt; </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> u want more? &lt; </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ding!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u1555( \u25d43\u25d4)\u1557 maybe &lt;\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki reads the text and laughs, before chewing down on his cheek and looking around, as if someone caught him. Katsuki leaves him on read, and considers cleaning tonight so he can have Izuku over early tomorrow. This is going to take some time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He saves the photo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has been to his house more times this month than he has in the last six, and it\u2019s strange, because they\u2019re <em> both </em>becoming accustomed to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki was out fixing up his lawn when Izuku showed up early, having some excuse about already being on this side of town for an errand, so Katsuki lets him sit on his brick wall and hang out while Katsuki finishes watering his small lawn (still better than everyone else\u2019s, fuck you).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is talkative today, but it\u2019s not as annoying as usual. Izuku follows him into the house, and kicks off his shoes while Katsuki washes his hands in the kitchen sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had no idea how to handle it!\u201d Izuku laughs, \u201cThey told me they were looking for a broom. Like \u2014 okay, I know I\u2019m kinda\u2019 thick sometimes, but I was seventeen once, too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cInterns,\u201d Katsuki rolls his eyes, but the mental picture still makes him snort a laugh. \u201cThey\u2019ve got guts, I\u2019ll give \u2018em that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI pretended to buy into their lie because I didn\u2019t want to embarrass them,\u201d Izuku rubs his nose. \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve corrected their behavior. I know the hormones are terrible, but the agency closet just isn\u2019t the time or place.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d Katsuki says, and Izuku squeaks, waving his hand around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up! Let\u2019s forget that happened.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hm. Katsuki wipes his hands off on a towel, and comes around to the barstool, where Izuku has planted himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably did the right thing. Getting caught is enough punishment, for now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku giggles, and his knees part naturally when Katsuki comes to stand between them. It\u2019s almost enough for Katsuki\u2019s heartrate to pick up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. They\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t <em> you </em> who found them <em> . </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I woulda\u2019 milked the fuck out of that. They wouldn\u2019t show their faces around here for weeks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a bully,\u201d Izuku coos, and something about his tone makes Katsuki\u2019s ears prick. Izuku is staring down at him, and Katsuki sets his hands safely on Izuku\u2019s outer thighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of seventeen. Still poppin\u2019 boners?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku jerks his chin away, but his voice comes out steady.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cErr...more often than I\u2019d like to admit. That\u2019s your fault, by the way.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Katsuki says, rubbing at his knees. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it. You ready to be good?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The needy, excited look on Izuku\u2019s face makes him feel breathless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki tugs his gloves on, and the game starts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sets aside a good half-hour to get Izuku warmed up. His hands start off soft before he gets rough. It doesn\u2019t take long to get Izuku tied up how he\u2019d like, a vibe stuffed up his ass and a black blindfold around his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki sits on his side chair and casually scrolls through his social media, while Izuku squirms and whines and struggles on his bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s stuck in the leapfrog pose, and Katsuki busted out the leather cuffs instead of the rope, because he plans on clipping Izuku into multiple positions. His face is forced down in the bed, his hands tucked between his legs and clipped to the bar spreading his ankles apart. Iuku is wearing unused belts on his thighs, and the clips jingle and click as he shakes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster,\u201d Izuku begs, his teeth chattering in his skull. <em> \u201cPlease, </em> I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t take anymore \u2014 I won\u2019t \u00a0\u2014\u00a0<em>ahn! </em>\u201d Izuku digs his forehead into the pillows and keens, and the vibrator buzzes distantly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki checks his timer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSix more minutes. You can do it, baby. Remember the rule?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo cumming,\u201d Izuku whines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. Try to relax for me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cuffs click and grind, and the bar between his ankles goes <em> clang! </em>as Izuku struggles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too <em> hard. </em> I \u2014 I can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki quietly locks his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never give you a command you aren\u2019t capable of. You trust me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, and turns his head as he hears Katsuki\u2019s voice move somewhere else in the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen relax for me, darling.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku physically tries. Gods, he looks <em> gorgeous, </em>dark hair sticky against his forehead, face down and ass up, the tips of his pink ears covered by the blindfold. Katsuki is quiet as he picks up a toy and places it in his back pocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He counts out another minute, and then presses his hand to the base of Izuku\u2019s spine. His skin is damp and hot under his gloves. Izuku <em> caves, </em>like a single hand is enough to get him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Sir, <em> please.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it, thirty whole minutes, baby I\u2019m so proud,\u201d Katsuki unclips his wrists, and Izuku sighs happily as he\u2019s allowed to sit upright. \u201cWell done.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, master.\u201d The change in position rubs the toy deeper, and Izuku chokes, clenching his thighs together. <em> \u201cAh! </em> I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s still going \u2014 mm! <em> \u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too close,\u201d Izuku hiccups. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t make it.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The desperation in his voice is nice. Katsuki reaches between his cheeks and clicks the toy off, and Izuku goes limp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for telling me. I\u2019d rather stop than have you break a rule, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cross your arms behind your neck and clip you into place.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku nods blindly, turning his head to listen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki stands up on the mattress to grab the cord he has hanging from the bolted carabiner in the ceiling. He positions Izuku\u2019s hands up and over his back, crossed at the wrists and elbows outward; Katsuki nudges him up to sit on his knees so the cord will hold him. The coils are strong, meaning it\u2019ll take effort for Izuku to stay sitting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis bungee can take about three hundred pounds,\u201d Katsuki explains. \u201cBut any more than that, and you\u2019ll break the ceiling in. I\u2019ll be very upset, okay? Give me a color if something is too much.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku almost laughs \u2014 and Katsuki forgives the character break, just this once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes master.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki swats his hip for the attitude, and Izuku makes a happy sound. He decides to step off the bed and let Izuku sit there for a minute. He looks pretty, and Katsuki chooses to stare as he wiggles and adjusts to get comfortable. The position is going to ache eventually, but that\u2019s what Katsuki wants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t let Izuku know where he is. Izuku has hero-trained hearing, so he probably has a good idea, but Katsuki still keeps his footsteps quiet. He pulls the flogger out of his back pocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d Izuku tips his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I give you an order?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen stay there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, and Katsuki twirls the handle around in his fingers. He decides to drag the end of the toy up between Izuku\u2019s legs, and Izuku startles, jerking to sit up higher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find this to be similar to the crop,\u201d Katsuki explains. \u201cBut the end has tassels, like a whip. It\u2019s an increase on the pain scale.\u201d He pets down Izuku\u2019s backside, rolling the handle along his spine, light enough to tickle. Izuku\u2019s breath quickens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I give you lashes now, then your ass is going to hurt even more when I fuck you.\u201d Katsuki feathers between his shoulder blades, then under his armpit. Izuku squeaks and thrashes, and Katsuki drags up and down, torturing him further. \u201cDo you want that, pet?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god\u00a0<em>yes! </em>\u201d Izuku begs. He continues to flinch, and Katsuki walks around to tap the tassels lightly against Izuku\u2019s chest, rubbing over his nipples. \u201cNgh! I want it badly, sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me why?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it will please you,\u201d Izuku repeats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki decides to tease him further.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy will it please me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Izuku bites his tongue, and wiggles as Katsuki pets across the head of his cock. It\u2019s standing completely upright, and it twitches as Katsuki teases him. So pretty, so obedient. \u201cUm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBaby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 know,\u201d Izuku flushes. \u201cMaster, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki presses the flogger handle under his chin and lifts his head up. The mattress squeaks as Katsuki presses a knee in the bed, and he lets Izuku feel his breath against his ear as he leans closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know why?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you will look <em> beautiful,</em>\u201d Katsuki grips his hair and tugs, \u201cwith the marks I\u2019ll give you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku inhales sharply. He\u2019s responsive as Katsuki gets in his face, breathing heavy, but blind to how close Katsuki is. The air feels charged, electric, tangible, like Katsuki could bite it and feel the electricity with his teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sounds you\u2019ll make,\u201d Katsuki continues, \u201cwill be beautiful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a single, terrible moment \u2014 Katsuki wants to kiss him. Izuku\u2019s lips are parted and wet and bitten and Katsuki wants to, he fucking <em> wants.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThe way your body responds, against your own will.\u201d Katsuki flicks the head of his cock so it\u2019ll hurt, and Izuku yelps, twitching. \u201cIt pleases me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is breaking apart. His erection twitches insistently, and Izuku looks embarrassed about it, but to Katsuki, it\u2019s the highest compliment he could get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want it, please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki gets up off the bed to stand behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve chosen ten for you. No breaks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Izuku begs, and with the first whip, he sobs. \u201c<em>Thank you!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki feels drunk with it. Two, three, four, five. One after the other, perfect lines exactly where he wants them, new marks on top of fading, old bruises; he\u2019s <em> stunning, </em>like every dominant\u2019s dream. The way his body shivers, how his spine arches and his arms fight against the bungee \u2014 Katsuki could just float off into space. Izuku\u2019s cries are painful, but happy, and Katsuki is eating it up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Six, seven, eight. The slaps are loud in his ears, and Izuku\u2019s ass is pink and hot to the touch, even through his gloves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s perfect, he\u2019s <em> perfect. </em> Screeching <em> master, yes! Yes!\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Mine! He\u2019s mine!\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nine, ten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki suddenly can't take it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Izuku,\u201d Katsuki chokes. \u201cThat was amazing. Fuck \u2014 I have to have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, hanging his head heavy and pulling against the bungee, and suddenly he\u2019s <em> loud. </em>His filter has been beaten out of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease! Please! <em> Master please! Fuck me \u2014 I need it, I can\u2019t wait any more \u2014 please, sir!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki can no longer tolerate the leather barrier. He <em> needs </em> to feel Izuku\u2019s skin<em>. </em>Suddenly he is up on the bed, pulling out the toy and ripping off his gloves. Izuku moans at the feeling of his bare hands, and Katsuki pulls and kneads at his stinging behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you sound so sexy,\u201d Katsuki tells him, at the back of his ear. \u201cSo perfect for me. This cable will hold your weight, I want you to bounce in my lap for me, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Izuku sobs happily. \u201cYes! I will!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki burns to bite his neck, suck on his tongue, kiss him until his mouth is numb \u2014 but he has to keep barriers (fuck, it\u2019s torture), or the spell will be broken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is so hard it hurts; he yanks down his jeans and grinds his cock against Izuku\u2019s sore ass \u2014 and Izuku is shivering, clenching his fingers and rubbing back against him so needy, Katsuki misses his hole twice before slipping in. (The kink list had checked bareback, and fuck if Katsuki hadn\u2019t been thinking about that every night for weeks).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The toy stretched him perfectly, and they both make a relieved sound when Katsuki bottoms out \u2014 like they\u2019ve both been waiting for this. Like it means more than it does. But Katsuki can\u2019t even begin to spare the braincells to think about that. Izuku is wet and burning hot, and in this position, Izuku\u2019s bodyweight forces him all the way down until their thighs meet. Izuku\u2019s head cracks back against his shoulder, and he <em> screams.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>It actually startles Katsuki for a moment. Izuku is sweating worse than Katsuki.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t!\u201d Izuku wheezes. \u201cI\u2019ll finish, <em> wait, please.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou can hold it,\u201d Katsuki urges, and holds him by the waist. \u201cCome on, bounce for me, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is <em> loud. </em>Katsuki didn\u2019t know he had it in him. He openly moans as he sits up on his knees, and the sound reverbs right into his fucking core. Everything has built into this. Katsuki wants to grip him by the throat and nail him into oblivion, but he needs Izuku to feel comfortable setting the pace first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a moment to get moving, but once he does, Katsuki feels his eyeballs roll into the back of his skull. He grits his teeth and helps Izuku with part of his weight, squeezing hot into his bare thighs; and the sounds that come out of this guy \u2014 holy fuck. Short, loud whines of <em> ah! ah! ah! </em>And Katsuki has never felt his patience rub so damn thin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fucked his own share of subs, but Izuku has the body to meet all of Katsuki\u2019s impossible demands, and he looks like an <em> angel </em>in his lap, sweaty and burning and crying out whenever his beaten ass hits Katsuki\u2019s thighs. The slapping sound is obscene, and Katsuki can hear Izuku\u2019s cock hitting his stomach as he rides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, bunny,\u201d Katsuki praises, petting him, all skin on skin, (finally fucking finally). \u201cYou feel so good baby, god you look like <em> porn, </em>sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sobs. The blindfold is getting wet, and a terrible part of Katsuki\u2019s ego just loves it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big,\u201d Izuku whines, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 Master, I w-won\u2019t make it.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThirty seconds,\u201d Katsuki tells him. \u201cThen I want you to come when I tell you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes with effort. Katsuki keep his hands clear from Izuku\u2019s cock, and his pace slows as he gets closer. He\u2019s trying so hard, the poor thing, and Katsuki mouths right over his freckled shoulder in a momentary loss of control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants Izuku\u2019s world to explode. Katsuki wants it to be because of <em> him. </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cNow, </em>baby \u2014 right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And on command, Izuku makes a high keening sound, before he clenches down and <em> moans. </em>He shakes so violently, that Katsuki stops fucking him to keep him conscious. Katsuki looks over Izuku\u2019s shoulder to watch him soak the sheets. It\u2019s incredible, and Izuku just keeps going \u2014 keeps crying and jerking in his lap, riding back on him and whining and it\u2019s so much, it\u2019s so fucking much, Katsuki has to grit his teeth to keep himself from following. It looks like the orgasm of the century, and Katsuki\u2019s ego is officially stroked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki coos at him, rubbing into his thighs until Izuku is breathing normally again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStunning, just fuckin\u2019 gorgeous. All better, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Izuku rasps. His voice is raw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not done,\u201d Katsuki says. He reaches around to squeeze his cock and tug, and Izuku nearly screeches. \u201cHey now. I denied you three times, didn\u2019t I? That means I owe you three more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki can physically see him pale, even through the blindfold. He turns his head to try and look over his shoulder. The shocked look on Izuku\u2019s face is gratifying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster, I \u2014\u00a0<em>ah, </em>I can\u2019t do that!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I say about the word <em> can\u2019t </em>?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku sounds like he\u2019s being strung alive and left for dead. It\u2019s kind of incredible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki unhooks Izuku to give his arms a rest, and re-clips his wrists to his thigh belts, so he won\u2019t thrash too much as Katsuki fucks him on his back. He tries to commit him to memory, wishes he could slow down time to etch this picture into his skull.</p>\n<p>He desperately wants to rip off Izuku's blindfold, but it would be too much face-to face like this. Not yet, at least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki continues to jerk him off as he pounds into him, and Izuku cries and cries and cries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cIt hurts! It hurts!\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s called post-orgasm torture for a reason, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is openly sobbing, and Katsuki wants desperately to swallow his cries, but they also fill him up like a bowl. He\u2019s hot all the way down to his toes, and when Izuku cries so hard he gags, Katsuki feels his stomach <em> curl.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a second one, darling,\u201d Katsuki urges, close enough to brush his lips against his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s your reward. Isn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d He keeps his other hand planted in the sheets for balance, and he jerks Izuku off at a terrible pace. Izuku is completely oversensitive, and Katsuki warms his hand to burn a little, and Izuku almost breaks his own leg as he thrashes. Katsuki won\u2019t have that. \u201cHey!\u201d Katsuki barks, and Izuku straightens up. \u201cThat was an order.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t! It\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re so deep! It hurts! <em> It hurts! </em> I can\u2019t! <em> \u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo more of that word, or you\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki fucks him long and hard, the headboard slamming on every other thrust, and Katsuki <em> barely </em>keeps his shit together when he grinds into Izuku\u2019s prostate, and Izuku comes a second time. It\u2019s violent, and Izuku screams silently, and Katsuki stills his hips to work Izuku through it. He spills less this time, but he still coats Katsuki\u2019s hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s </em>it baby, only two more to go. Don\u2019t you feel better already?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku knocks his head back against the pillows and whines weakly. He\u2019s going nonverbal, and Katsuki watches to make sure he\u2019s still listening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you with me, baby?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNnh.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still know your colors, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku nods shakily. Katsuki sits back on his heels and slips out just long enough to grab his wand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, good.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He flicks it on and presses it to Izuku\u2019s soft cock, and Izuku\u2019s previously limp body goes tight as a bowstring, and uh. Hope the neighborhood isn\u2019t home, because Iuzku screams bloody murder \u2014 and Katsuki spreads his sore cheeks and slips back in, only to do him slow and drawn out, a different type of torture as Izuku\u2019s back stays arched off the bed, wrists clinging and twisting against the restraints on his thighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki pushes up a flexible leg burned with freckles and scars \u2014 and just watches, like a king on his throne.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> More. You can take more, baby. Trust me, I\u2019ve got you \u2014 I won\u2019t let you fall. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku is a <em> mess. </em> His mouth pools with drool, and he chokes and cries and struggles as Katsuki forces him to get hard a third time. Izuku keeps trying to beg \u2014 trying to form words like <em> Master! Master! </em>But it's raspy and gargled and gone, just gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything slows down, to this. Izuku is breaking apart underneath him, and Katsuki feels his emotions run high, and his eyes start to burn against his own will.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo good,\u201d Katsuki praises, ignoring the crack in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re so <em> good. </em>Fuck, fuck I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is slipping. He\u2019s hiccupping so bad, his chest just wretches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yellow!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki understands that Izuku is reaching subspace. It\u2019s probably scaring him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki rocks in and out, a slow pace for Izuku to focus on. Katsuki can\u2019t even process his own pleasure right now \u2014 he\u2019s living for Izuku, hanging off his every cry, holding his breath for his next moan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, you\u2019re doing so well. I know you\u2019re scared \u2014 but you can go in there. I\u2019ll catch you. Don\u2019t worry about limits, don\u2019t worry about can or can\u2019t \u2014 <em> I\u2019m </em>in charge, not you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s spine lifts off the bed again, and Katsuki just grinds and grinds and grinds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cAh! Ahh!\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Katsuki coos, his throat tight. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. Let go.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku comes dry. He\u2019s so beautiful, that Katsuki gets kicked by his own orgasm. He curls over him, setting aside the wand and fucking jerkily through the endorphins. He feels cross-eyed, and can barely spare the brainpower to watch Izuku seize. And then drop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like magic, all that tension, the wiggling and the squirming and the wailing; it stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blindfold got rubbed off, and now Izuku is just watching him. His eyes are gone, his voice is gone \u2014 he\u2019s just <em> gone.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki shakes. Adrenaline hits him, and the rational part of his brain flies out the window.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> His. His. His.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> His sub. His baby. He needs Katsuki \u2014 he needs him.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki slips, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He breathes out steady, hyper focused and numb to the world. Izuku is just staring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want one more orgasm from you,\u201d Katsuki states clearly. Izuku just nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls out and stuffs Izuku with his fingers. Izuku closes his eyes and hums.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now, to Izuku, any stimulation \u2014 any pain \u2014 it\u2019s just going to feel like pleasure. He won\u2019t be able to feel much, and Katsuki has to keep the experience positive. He\u2019s working on instinct, now. The world could burn, and they wouldn\u2019t know it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your eyes on me,\u201d Katsuki says coolly. He leans down, right between Izuku\u2019s legs, and presses his mouth to his inner thigh. Izuku shivers, but doesn\u2019t react. Katsuki bites down, and Izuku makes a happy trilling sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>No response. Izuku blinks sleepily, and his eyes are full of <em> adoration \u2014 </em> all spiked right at Katsuki. He fingerfucks Izuku slowly, and he spends his time working a fourth orgasm out of him. He nips up into his hip, licks across the stubbly hair on his navel, works Izuku\u2019s hole slick with his own cum, and Izuku just purrs and purrs and <em> purrs.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>When he finally falls over the edge, he whines quietly, and comes dry and soft. Katsuki\u2019s heart rattles in his chest. He\u2019s so proud he can\u2019t even <em> take it.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it, sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands reach for him. Katsuki lets him pet his hair, and he feels himself vibrate as Izuku keeps making happy humming noises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gone.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you are. You were so good for me. I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was good?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki leans up far enough to kiss his cheek, because he\u2019s going to die if he can\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect. You stay in there until you feel okay to come out, alright?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gods, Katsuki could <em> cry. </em>This is why he doesn\u2019t drop subs often \u2014 their emotions always rattle his core, and he\u2019s left feeling overstimulated for days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s a future problem. Izuku's well being is his only priority (and how long has that been true? Katsuki won't think about that either).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki undoes the buckles on the leather cuffs one by one. Izuku is pure jelly, his arms limp like noodles as Katsuki releases his wrists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Poor Izuku is so out of it, that he doesn\u2019t even startle when Katsuki dips to grab a damp towel. This time Katsuki is the one that doesn\u2019t want to stray too far. The idea of Izuku leaving his sight makes him sick right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He strips down to his underwear on his way back into the bedroom, and Izuku is making grabby hands when Katsuki kneels back on the mattress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jeez, Izuku is a disaster. His eyes are puffy and swollen from crying, and he\u2019s covered in <em> many </em>various liquids, and Katsuki gets started on wiping him down. Izuku whines from the texture of the towel, and Katsuki clicks his tongue and pulls away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll go slower.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He starts at his inner calves again, wiping up in circular motions that get him used to the oversensitivity. Izuku twitches away when he cleans between his legs, and eventually the mess on his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done, you. Can you talk yet?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku just stares at him. Katsuki waits a hot minute for an answer, like Izuku\u2019s brain is running on power saving mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Katsuki rubs his thumb into his hip. \u201cCan you roll over? I\u2019ve got balm for the bruising.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku nods, and rolls obediently onto his stomach. He\u2019d walk right into traffic if Katsuki asked him to \u2014 and that power \u2014 it makes him <em> sick </em>thinking that someone else could have it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is <em> his.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The whip left claw-like marks on his skin, and Izuku\u2019s ass continues to look like a painting. It\u2019s pink and irritated, and Izuku sighs a happy sound when Katsuki rubs over an ointment for the sting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels good?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Words are a good sign. Katsuki wants to feel the heat with his mouth, so he leans down to kiss at one of the swollen lines. Izuku stretches out and purrs, pushing his ass out further, and Katsuki\u2019s heart rolls right into his stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I hold you?\u201d Katsuki asks. Izuku nods furiously, so Katsuki nudges them over to the dry part of the bed, and hauls Izuku over him. He locks him in with his arms, gets their knees to knock and their elbows to rub and <em> this </em>is what gets a reaction out of Izuku. This is what Katsuki was looking for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku clings onto him suddenly, like he\u2019s been waiting all along for permission to touch. He wraps his arms around Katsuki\u2019s neck and jams his face right in his throat, and Katsuki locks him in like a seatbelt. The hug is tight and safe. Izuku takes his first full breath, and it warms Katsuki from the inside out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku wiggles into him like a snuggly bear, and says,</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Katsuki\u2019s heart falls out of his ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes sting, and Katsuki has to kick his ass back to the freakin\u2019 present. <em> Hello </em>real world, holy fuck. A thousand and one alarms go off in his head, and Katsuki feels like he\u2019s been dumped in cold water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Best friend. Best friend. Best friend. This is your fucking best friend.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki bites his tongue until it hurts. He rubs his hand up and down between Izuku\u2019s shoulder blades, swallowing thickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku is in subspace right now. It\u2019s the endorphins talking, so whatever Izuku blabbers about is not his fault. Katsuki repeats this like a prayer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku makes a sound in complaint, and Katsuki pets his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh, just focus on you right now. How do you feel?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Good. Sleepy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has never spent the night, but he\u2019s not sending Izuku home like this, even if he comes out of it within the hour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNoo. Wanna\u2019 stay with you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere,\u201d Katsuki reminds. \u201cDo you feel sore?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh huh. Just floaty.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki knocks Izuku\u2019s hip with his knee, and buries his nose in his hair. He smells like any other sweaty adult man \u2014 but he likes it; it\u2019s grounding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus on my breathing, okay? You\u2019re safe here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku cuddles further into him, and Katsuki\u2019s throat is full of cotton. <em> Stop stop stop.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki is only able to fall asleep when Izuku is totally out, nothing but dead weight on his chest, heavy over his heart. His brain has too much to process right now \u2014 so Katsuki chooses to think about absolutely none of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Katsuki wakes, he feels like he\u2019s been run over by a bus. But like, an emotional one. Damn,\u00a0if Katsuki is exhausted, he can only imagine how the nerd feels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>His eyes snap open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fuck! Deku!\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki slams his hand out on the sheets, and panics when he meets an empty space. Jerking upright in bed, he rubs furiously at his eyes, looking around the bedroom. Izuku\u2019s clothes are still folded on the desk, but his phone is gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t tell me this asshole walked out the door naked \u2014 I swear to Christ I\u2019ll kill him\u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>The door squeaks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku comes waddling back into the bedroom, butt naked and with tea in hand. He pauses when he sees Katsuki sitting up in bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d Izuku blinks. \u201cBusted.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is disgusted at how relieved he feels. He flops back onto his pillow and rubs the sleep out of his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly hell, I thought I was gonna\u2019 have to bail you out for streaking.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou give me a lot of credit,\u201d Izuku says, and crawls back in his bed. Everything about this is so completely new \u2014 so why does it feel so natural?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki watches him with one eye open, and Izuku pulls the sheets politely over his lap, like Katsuki didn\u2019t fuck his brains out last night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a sip and flinches from the heat. He blows the top of his mug and tries again, and Katsuki watches the way he shifts stiffly. His side profile is lit from the window, like a stupid angel or something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo um...last night.\u201d Izuku clicks his nails on his mug. \u201cThat was intense.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s certainly one way to put it. Katsuki hums in agreement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSore?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cErr...yeah. In more ways than one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki chews on the inside of his cheek, and props his head up on one arm to look casual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, and his voice sounds raspy from all the crying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, um. I hate to stroke your ego like this, but that was the best sex I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ll never doubt you again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grins at him, and pokes at his thigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTold ya\u2019 I\u2019m the shit<em>.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku snorts, and leans back against the headboard. He doesn\u2019t appear to have any memory of his confession last night, and Katsuki tells himself he\u2019s glad about that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea how you do it, Kacchan.\u201d For just a second, Katsuki thinks he might\u2019ve seen Izuku\u2019s eyes shine over, his face falling sad and distant \u2014 but it\u2019s gone before Katsuki can blink. \u201cI guess I should go home, huh.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki groans as he stretches, popping his shoulder and his neck, before sitting up again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell shit. I\u2019ll at least make you breakfast.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, you\u2019re helping.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, but I\u2019m <em> sore </em>Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoo fucking hoo, do you want pancakes or what?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, do you have strawberries?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look like a barbarian?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki digs out his bluetooth speaker, and Izuku is given the very easy and simple task of cutting strawberries, while Katsuki flips pancakes in the pan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re only half-dressed, and Izuku makes it clear that he\u2019d rather stand than sit, and Katsuki takes the opportunity to smack his butt with the spatula, and gets an egg thrown at his face for the trouble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em> so </em>freaking lucky this didn\u2019t break,\u201d Katsuki says, lifting the egg he caught. \u201cOr you\u2019d be six feet under right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it would\u2019ve been pretty funny,\u201d Izuku admits, rubbing his sore butt. Katsuki tries to smack him again, but Izuku dodges this time, and Katsuki is forced away when his pancake starts to bubble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit eating all strawberries.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Izuku pops another in his mouth and laughs, and Katsuki wants to be mad, but he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Izuku keeps staring at him, and it makes Katsuki want to touch him, even if they\u2019re not in a scene and \u2014\u00a0<em>no, </em> no way. <em> Friends with benefits, hello. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey Kacchan?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe used to hang out like this a lot, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Izuku slips another strawberry in his mouth, painting his lips pink. \u201cWell, I guess \u2014 not <em> a lot </em>a lot, but, when did we get so busy?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we hit the top ten, probably.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re so close to our goal...but I still missed hanging out with you outside of work. I mean \u2014\u201d Izuku flushes. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can still um. Be like this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki squeezes the spatula and stares at the pan. This is too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo catch butterflies with your nerd friends if you want someone to <em> hang out </em>with. I ain\u2019t the guy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t bothered by his attempt to shrug him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh stop that, yes you are. Remember when we did eighteen shots for my birthday and then stumbled into that paintball arena?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki cracks a smile, and flips a pancake in Izuku\u2019s direction. He catches it on the plate with one hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck yeah I do. Whooped your ass so bad you cried.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cried because I was <em> drunk </em>and I saw a duck crossing the road,\u201d Izuku points. \u201cDon\u2019t get it twisted.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki laughs, and Izuku smiles at him \u2014 and Katsuki is left to wonder what the hell he\u2019s doing. He would\u2019ve shoved any other sub out the door first thing in the morning; but this isn\u2019t a normal hookup, it\u2019s freaking Deku. The lines in the sand are getting blurry.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Don\u2019t shit where you eat, </em>Mom used to say. Ugh, shut up Mom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki keeps making pancakes, and Izuku finishes off the strawberries. They stand as they eat, and it gets quiet, so all you can hear is Katsuki\u2019s alternative music, and the sound of the ice machine running in the fridge.</p>\n<p>Izuku decides to be shy when he says goodbye, flipping his phone in his hands and staring at the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. So we\u2019re okay, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his eyes and leans up against the doorframe, arms crossed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbass, again with this. I think our friendship is sealed in blood by now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s gaze turns away. He bites his lip, and his smile doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. The distant look on his face is gone so fast that Katsuki misses it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. See you on Monday, Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLater, nerd.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something feels off, but Katsuki doesn\u2019t have the brainpower to compartmentalize the last twenty-four hours right now. He has a lot of toy cleaning left to do. The monotony will be good for his head, anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t doing so hot this week, and it\u2019s pissing Katsuki off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re normally a well-oiled machine, crafted through years of vigorous training and practice, but Izuku is making rookie mistakes, and if it gets any worse, it could cost them lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So far they\u2019re only little things; breaking a few windows on accident, smashing into a bus, pushing his quirk too far and straining his ankle. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but it <em> does </em>piss Katsuki off to no end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki can see the frustration on Izuku\u2019s face, so he chooses not to drill him on it (this time). Nobody is harder on Izuku than himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Izuku greets, perched right where Katsuki expected him to be. The bunny ears catch in the wind, and his hair tosses around his forehead. He really looks like a hero, when he crouches like that. Probably \u2018cause it\u2019s the pose most of his merch is made in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grunts, chewing the rest of his bagel and locking his gauntlet in place. He looks Izuku over \u2014 takes note of the eyebags and yesterday\u2019s scratches from the broken glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady for a fresh start?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku looks relieved. He nods, and then they\u2019re off jumping rooftops again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ugh, Katsuki is wiped out, come Friday. He won\u2019t admit that to nobody but God, but <em> fuck, </em>these twenty-four-hour overnight calls have been a pain in his ass. Katsuki keeps getting paged at the worst times, and he is one more three-am call away from wringing his assistant\u2019s neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s just doing her job,\u201d Izuku reminds him tiredly, scooping up a bus and rolling it back on it\u2019s wheels. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot the messenger.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, I <em> know.</em>\u201d Katsuki grunts, and sets down a concrete slab. \u201cI\u2019m just sick of these cleanup calls.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s usually not on the search and rescue team, but this whole section of the city lost power during an attack, so the association called all hands on deck to clear the roads before the eight-am rush. The only solace Katsuki has is knowing that dumbass Denki got ripped out of bed to be a human jumper cable again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku flips over another car with one hand, and then dusts off the hood, like that\u2019ll make a difference. Katsuki stops to wipe his forehead, pushing up his mask in the process. Izuku powers down before he offers a waterbottle, and Katsuki waves him off. Izuku shrugs and takes his own sip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going clubbing with Shouto and Ochaco on Sunday.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki looks at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t inviting you,\u201d Izuku teases, and Katsuki rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, then I won\u2019t wait around.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Izuku leans up against the car, and the hood creaks. \u201cI was wondering if you just wanted to come over and smoke tomorrow. I\u2019ve uh. Had enough beatings this week.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, no session. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal, but Katsuki still raises his eyebrows. Izuku looks sheepish, so Katsuki was correct in assuming that Izuku has been kicking himself over the random mistakes this week (of course he was right, he\u2019s right about everything, duh).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done that in a while,\u201d Katsuki notes. Izuku shrugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki would like to point out that they could just <em> not </em>hang out this weekend, but that makes his chest feel all tight and gross, and Katsuki hates it, so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t bringing anything.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d Izuku laughs, dusting off his hands. \u201cConsider us even.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He really doesn\u2019t remember, does he?\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki lied. He brings takeout, because he knows he\u2019s going to get hungry, and all Izuku keeps are those disgusting gluten-free barbeque chips and a fridge full of protein shakes, and Katsuki will never stoop so low to torture his stomach with that crap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hallway still smells like cheese, and a familiar herd of elephants is stomping around on top of them, but Izuku busts out the bong and an old <em> All Might </em>movie, so Katsuki tones the annoyances out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku looks warm in sweatpants and a long sleeve shirt. The sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and when he stands up to grab Katsuki\u2019s Chinese food out of the fridge, Katsuki notes how <em> long </em>those joggers are on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre those mine?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Izuku looks around the takeout in his arms, down to his toes. \u201cHah, yeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I stole them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki trades him the bong for the food, and Izuku takes another hit while Katsuki opens the rice container.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou rat bastard, right from under my freakin\u2019 nose.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re the <em> Plus Ultra All-Might </em>line from UA! They\u2019re comfy and so hard to find!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know! I <em> like </em>those!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey fit me better,\u201d Izuku argues. Katsuki reaches over and yanks at the waistband, and they fall to his knees. Izuku squeaks and tugs them back up, and Katsuki laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s bullshit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just pantsed me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot worse,\u201d Katsuki says, and that shuts him up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing about this is even remotely sexual. Izuku sits cross legged on the couch and shovels food in his mouth with those crappy splinter-inducing chopsticks, and he\u2019s using a pink hair clip to tie back his bangs, and the pushed-up sleeves of his shirt show off the gnarliest scars on his body, and Katsuki feels <em> hot. </em>Like, turned on, hot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s disgusting, and Katsuki blames the high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s apartment smells like food and weed and <em> Izuku; </em>and\u00a0it\u2019s homey and warm. The lighter got kicked somewhere, so Katsuki uses his fingers to light the end, and Izuku slaps his thigh hard enough to sting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you blow that up I\u2019m going to be <em> very </em>upset with you, Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like the lock on my door?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Katsuki grins. \u201cExactly like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head and laughs, and <em> why, why \u2014 why doesn\u2019t he remember \u2014\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s chest squeezes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Why do I want him to?\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is looking at him, instead of the movie. He\u2019s dazed, a bit out of it, but not enough that he couldn\u2019t respond to an emergency call if he needed to. His eyes are fuzzy, but they always hold this finer intelligence in them. This intellect that pisses Katsuki off \u2014 (<em> don\u2019t look down on me, nerd! Nerd! You nerd \u2014 ) </em> and maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so frustrating. Katsuki always, <em> always </em>knows what Izuku is thinking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crooked fingers caress his cheek, and Katsuki\u2019s soul leaves his body so rapidly, he can\u2019t even react.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s thumb wipes the corner of his mouth, and for a moment, Katsuki can taste his own heartbeat. Izuku\u2019s eyes are so impossibly <em> green; </em> Katsuki is reminded of the hands tied like a bow, the eyes that cried and sobbed and the mouth that <em> begged so sweetly\u2026\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku mumbles. He pulls back and shows off his finger, \u201cYou had rice on your face.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grinds his teeth and slaps Izuku\u2019s hand away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t baby me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Izuku giggles, flopping backwards. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, sometimes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki wants to bite his mouth until it bleeds. Kiss it until it feels better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m an idiot.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki had hopes for a better week. Honestly, in their line of business, he should\u2019ve known better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is able to reverse-solve a murder mystery just off of the smell of patrolium and a pair of footprints, and typically Katsuki <em> loves </em>to one up the police, but the success is short lived.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their teamwork is clunky this week. Butting heads is typical, but fucking up <em> this </em>bad? It doesn\u2019t happen.</p>\n<p>Long story short, Izuku misses Katsuki\u2019s hand in one of their combo moves, and Izuku ends up with four broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder, and to make it all worse, the villain gets away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eri is on duty as an intern that day, so Izuku can thank his lucky fucking stars that he doesn\u2019t have to sit through two months of healing ribs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only once they\u2019d reached the safety of the agency locker room did Katsuki grab Izuku by the shirt and slam him up against the wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em> hell,</em>\u201d Katsuki sneers, \u201cis your problem?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is grimy and tired and bruised, but he still has a fire in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a break, it was just an accident!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <em> make </em>mistakes, Deku,\u201d Katsuki hisses, getting close enough to almost be nose to nose. \u201cYou might\u2019ve been a fuckup in UA, but you\u2019re a pro now. Get your shit together and act like it, \u2018cause I\u2019m not tolerating another week of this bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d Izuku shoves him, and Katsuki stumbles back. \u201cI don\u2019t need this right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is aware that he screwed up. But Katsuki\u2019s anger simmers, and he clenches his fists to keep his quirk from popping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you. If you miss my hand again, I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The angry look on Izuku\u2019s face gradually shifts into understanding, and then guilt. Izuku rubs at his sore shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really am sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki spits old blood into the drain, and turns his back towards Izuku, facing his locker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever. Thought I fuckin\u2019 killed you \u2014 gave me a goddamn heart attack, I swear to god I\u2019ll make you wish I did.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs out of his nose, and doesn't reply. When he starts undressing again, Katsuki gets a view of his bare, unmarked ass, fully healed as a side effect of Eri\u2019s quirk, and it\u2019s disappointing. Like someone painted white over his canvas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s brain chooses to remind him of how Izuku looked in his arms, cuddly and content and oozing happiness out of every pore, and Katsuki slams his locker shut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou comin\u2019 over this weekend?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t respond at first \u2014 but he looks at Katsuki out of the corner of his eye and says,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201c--thank you for that uplifting message.

Channel Three has brought on two hero experts to discuss collateral on --\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t even have to ask this time. Suds turns the TV off entirely, and Eijirou gives him a grateful half-smile. Katsuki grinds his teeth and throws back his drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man, go easy on Midoriya. It happens, I got absolutely roasted by the paps last week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAin\u2019t all his fault,\u201d Katsuki admits with frustration. \u201cI have to get stronger. Better.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard. Hey, maybe I can switch my gym days around and we can go together?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugs, and Eijirou knows it\u2019s the best answer he\u2019s going to get, so he grins and slaps Katsuki on the back. Katsuki traces the edge of his glass with his thumb, and frowns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki and Sero tagged along today, but they\u2019re off playing pool in the corner; Katsuki drops his voice so they won\u2019t hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Deku.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eijirou tips his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe friend.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eijirou has, in hindsight, a pretty hilarious face journey. Confusion, realization, shock, and then acceptance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. The one you\u2019re\u2026\u201d Eijirou lowers his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re hooking up with Midoriya?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my lord.\u201d Eijirou wipes across his mouth and stares. \u201cI\u2019m surprised and\u2026 also not surprised. Uh, how\u2019s that going for you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> thought </em>it was fine,\u201d Katsuki huffs. \u201cBut I have a feeling that these fuckups might\u2019ve been my fault.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. I know Midoriya is nice and all, but he\u2019s a tough guy. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not all you.\u201d Eijirou bumps their knees together. \u201cUm, do you like him?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to spare your life and pretend you didn\u2019t just ask me that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, you really are a bro.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey dudes!\u201d Denki waves from across the bar. \u201cCome play! We\u2019ll do doubles.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m game. Katsu?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess we win by default then,\u201d Sero grins, and Katsuki is already off the barstool, grabbing a pool cue and forcing Sero to duck as he moves to smack him with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t break my shit!\u201d Suds calls, and Eijirou bows and apologies for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rigorous gym routine helps, but not enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki stands in the shower with his head dunked under the water, watching it spin in mindless circles around the drain, his wet hair hanging in his peripheral. He can hear Izuku\u2019s voice in his head, crystal clear, rasped and soft and a little deep in his maturity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI love you.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not real, you idiot. You fool. You moron.</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s heart is in his ears, and he punches the shower wall to make it stop. The pain in his knuckles is a good enough distraction. At least his blood is pulsing in his hand, instead of his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. They\u2019ll fuck this weekend, he\u2019ll tie Izuku up all nice, and everything will go back to normal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is practiced in the art of minding his own dang business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He always keeps an ear open for trouble, but he tries to avoid starting fights if necessary (although his friends will disagree). If he passes a few weirdos on the train, then hey. You do you, man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is already feeling strange when he goes to Katsuki\u2019s house. It always smells nice in here, a house full of <em> Kacchan, </em> but it doesn\u2019t ebb his anxiety today. His heart has been in his stomach for the last two weeks, and he\u2019s been a wreck because of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Skipping a session did not help whatsoever. Now, Izuku is going for the opposite approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku hopes, maybe, that Katsuki can screw his head back on. He knows how to do it verbatim, like he\u2019s is reading out of an Ikea instruction manual. It doesn\u2019t feel real \u2014 like the past month has been a dream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku needs this today. He needs to forget.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan says he\u2019s going to take a quick shower before they start, because he was out helping his parents fix their roof this morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sad I missed that,\u201d Izuku says. Katsuki flips him off and barks <em> just stay put, </em>then slams the door shut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku still feels bad about their previous argument in the locker room. An angry Kacchan isn\u2019t anything to write home about, but this was a different kind of anger. It was a furious worry. Izuku is slipping.</p>\n<p>He presses his face into his hands and groans. None of this is very hero-like. These feelings are all so terribly human.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Five minutes into Katsuki\u2019s shower, a knock raps on the front door. Izuku looks around twice. A delivery, maybe? But the knocking persists, and Izuku tiptoes down the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Kacchan? Someone\u2019s at the door.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThen fucking answer it, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Alright then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku peeks through the peephole, and then throws the lock. A shorter, thin looking man, with fluffy white hair and big brown eyes is standing on Kacchan\u2019s porch. He looks young, maybe twenty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d the man blinks, like he wasn\u2019t expecting Izuku. \u201cHello.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku raises his eyebrows. \u201cHi?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh, my name\u2019s Kito. Is Katsuki home?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is surprised by the casual use of Kacchan\u2019s name. Izuku has never seen this man in his life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yes, he is. Can I help you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kito takes one long look at him, and it makes Izuku feel scrutinized.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cErr...no. Wrong house, sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Izuku frowns. \u201cI can go grab him if it\u2019s important. He\u2019s just in the shower.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re his new sub, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku nearly chokes. He folds his arms in front of his chest protectively and squeaks, \u201cExcuse me?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> How the heck... </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Kito waves. \u201cI\u2019m an empath. I was Katsuki\u2019s old sub.\u201d Izuku tenses, his defenses flying up like walls, and Kito has the nerve to laugh at him. \u201cHey, my bad. I didn\u2019t know he picked up someone new. I just came by to see if he would work me over for old times sake.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s heart sinks.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Kacchan had sex with this man.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Izuku tries to play nice and ignore how desperately he wants to slam the door. \u201cWell...he\u2019s taken, sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> A lie.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku is very aware that their contract has nothing about exclusivity. Izuku isn\u2019t even sure why he said it. He just wants this man to <em> leave.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI get it.\u201d Kito presses his lips together, and a darker, more serious look falls on his face. \u201cHey, watch yourself with that one. He\u2019ll drop you the second he gets bored.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku puffs up defensively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan isn\u2019t like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kito\u2019s eyebrows raise at the nickname, and Izuku must look pathetic in his eyes \u2014 but this man knows nothing, absolutely <em> nothing. </em> No one will ever know Katsuki like Izuku does. <em> No one.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019m just saying. We had a thing for three months, and the second I asked about going serious, he dumped me the next day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world falls out from beneath his feet. Izuku feels numb in the doorway, a terrible dread swallowing him whole. His voice cracks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Um. Thank you for telling me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kito gives him a look of pity, and waves his goodbye.\u00a0 \u201cSure. Don\u2019t bother telling him I stopped by. Have a good one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku waves back. He\u2019s sluggish to close the door. By now the shower has turned off, and Katsuki yells from the bathroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOi!! Who was it?\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smooths his hand over his mouth, completely horrified.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Jehovah\u2019s witness.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki laughs; it\u2019s the first laugh Izuku has heard from him this week. Izuku\u2019s fault, of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cShould I fly a pride flag out there? I\u2019ll add a pentagram for good luck.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and internally <em> screams, </em>before he clears his throat and calls out sweetly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that would do it!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki hasn\u2019t seen Izuku be this stiff since their first session.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s petting up and down Izuku\u2019s throat, pressing into his chin and digging into his jaw, but Izuku isn\u2019t responding the way he has come to expect.</p>\n<p>\u201cKneel for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t move, as if he didn\u2019t hear the command.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grips his face tight, and the leather digs into his skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. I told you to get on your knees. That was an order. \u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku looks up at him, and his eyes narrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinks <em> slow.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Well, this is new. Izuku looks serious, so Katsuki rolls with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, is that right?\u201d Katsuki jerks his head roughly, left then right, and then forces Izuku to look him in the eye. \u201cYou want to piss me off this week, is that it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku breathes out forcefully through his nose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki shoves him back to the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your attitude. Arms behind your back.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t listen. Katsuki thinks about Izuku missing his hand, his fingers slipping out of his grip and his shoulder crashing into the concrete, and it pisses him off because the memory hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grabs him roughly, yanks his arms backwards and squeezes so it stings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will <em> listen to me, </em>or you will forfeit your reward.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grunts and squirms, and Katsuki digs out his handcuffs; the metal ones that hurt. He locks Izuku\u2019s wrists in place.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cBad boys </em>have to sit and think about what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bad!\u201d Izuku argues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki flips him on his stomach. He hasn\u2019t gotten Izuku out of his boxer-briefs yet, and Katsuki cracks his hand against his clothed ass. Izuku gasps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes you are. Look at you \u2014 already pushing back against me like a <em> slut. </em> \u201d Katsuki digs his hands <em> hard </em>into Izuku\u2019s thighs, because he\u2019s out to bruise. \u201cGood boys don\u2019t talk back.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Izuku squirms, and Katsuki finally gets a proper reaction. His voice catches. \u201cI\u2019m <em> not a slut.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide that, now do you? I bet you begged so sweetly for your old masters to fuck you. Just can\u2019t get enough <em>cock, </em>can you<em>?</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014!\u201d Izuku squirms, voice straining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuck whores,\u201d Katsuki says, squeezing harder, <em> harder, harder. </em> The leather heats from his quirk. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t fuck <em> brats </em>who can\u2019t keep their mouths shut.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku shoulders shake, and Katsuki can hear his voice crack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not! Master <em> please. </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou started this. I\u2019m only following your lead\u2014yeah, keep squirming, you look like a bitch in heat. Nothing but a hole, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! <em> No!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll leave,\u201d Katsuki mulls. Izuku is still fidgeting, so Katsuki spanks across his upper thighs. \u201cIf you won\u2019t respect your <em> master, </em>then I won\u2019t stick around.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Slap!\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku sobs. His head rolls out on the pillows and his knees curl under him and he <em> bawls.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cRed!!\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s entire world stops spinning. He stares in horror as Izuku folds in on himself, crying his eyes out in painful sobs, and Katsuki\u2019s heart fucking <em> breaks.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He jerks to undo the cuffs. He can\u2019t move fast enough, and he\u2019s mortified as he gets Izuku on his back. Izuku just curls into his hands and cries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Katsuki checks him over. \u201cShit, are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Izuku weeps. \u201cKacchan I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t, <em> I can\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI thought \u2014 you were acting like you wanted\u2014\u201d Katsuki drowns in wave after wave of self hatred. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought that\u2019s what you were asking for. <em> Fuck </em>I should\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to stop this,\u201d Izuku says, wiping his eyes furiously. His cheeks are damp and sticky, but these tears make Katsuki feel like throwing himself in a ditch. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I know it\u2019s my fault. You were just so <em> good </em>to me and, and it was everything I wanted, and. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki is confused. He slowly pulls off his gloves one by one, and tosses them over the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks about how strange Izuku has been acting. He thinks about when it started. And it\u2019s not so much of a lightbulb, rather than a slow dawn of a dimmer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith me?!\u201d Izuku barks, and Katsuki reels back. He hiccups, and pulls the sheet up to wipe his eyes. \u201cI told you <em> I loved you, </em>asshole. And then you acted like it never happened.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki gapes. It\u2019s a revelation that makes his head spin. He can taste his heartbeat, for fucks sake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s voice comes out rasped as he argues, \u201cWh\u2014 you were dropped! The endorphins were fucking with your head. What you were feeling wasn\u2019t <em> real.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Izuku snarls. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to return my feelings, but how <em> dare </em>you invalidate them like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki snatches his wrist and holds on tight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Izuku. </em>The person you love isn\u2019t me. It\u2019s an imaginary persona.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t I love both?\u201d Izuku asks, and Katsuki is stunned silent. Izuku swallows, and pulls his knees to his chest, yanking his wrist free. \u201cIt\u2019s still you in those scenes, Kacchan. Just like \u2014 how I\u2019m still <em> me.</em>\u201d Izuku hides his face. \u201cFuck, I should\u2019ve never agreed to this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>That hurts the most. Katsuki sits back and stares at the wall. His stomach feels like a black pit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ceiling fan goes <em> click, click, click.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019 that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s voice is muffled in his knees. He\u2019s just a fluffy head of dark hair, the neons picking up green highlights. The air feels cold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe truth is...I loved you before we started all this. I\u2019ve loved you for a long time. When you offered a contract with me, I was just being selfish \u2014 I should\u2019ve said no, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki scratches through his hair and sighs. Izuku looks like he wants to disappear, and Katsuki <em> loathes </em>it. He wants the man that doesn\u2019t hesitate to throw himself on the front line, the one who rescues people with a smile, the man that can carry a building on his shoulders. Only Katsuki can make Izuku small like this, and he hates it right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re always changing, aren\u2019t they? Can\u2019t just stay the same, for five damn minutes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Katuski starts. \u201cI\u2019d burn down the whole fuckin\u2019 world, if you asked.\u201d Izuku peeks up at him. Katsuki is the one to look away. \u201cI never let myself think about how I felt. I didn\u2019t wanna\u2019 waste my time entertaining something that was damn near impossible to begin with.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like the Kacchan I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugs. \u201cYou bring out the worst in me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs humorlessly. \u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the best,\u201d Katsuki adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a tradeoff.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stares at his feet. The air conditioning rattles, and the LEDS shift hues at a gradual pace, casting different shadows across the room. Katsuki doesn\u2019t move, and neither does Izuku.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Izuku whispers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki picks at his thumbnail.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku rubs his nose, and pets his hand over the sheets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t love me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s head whips up. The surprised look on his face hurts his heart. Katsuki shakes his head, and extends a hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t move at first. He wipes his face with his forearm, and after a moment of hesitation, he scooches closer on the bed. Katsuki doesn\u2019t reach out to touch him. He just crosses his legs, Izuku doing the same, and the LEDS shift to a pinkish color that catches on all the features of Izuku\u2019s face. Their knees bump. Izuku looks at him, and Katsuki shrugs a shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour call.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walk out the door, or give them a chance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would want that with me?\u201d Izuku asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI already have everything else.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s ears go pink, but he presses his lips together, and eventually the corners creep into a smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess we do, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t move. He watches Izuku\u2019s eyelashes cast shadows over the freckles on his cheeks; and when he waits long enough, he sees them flutter closed. Izuku leans bravely between them for a kiss. Katsuki meets him partway.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kiss is ironically, almost hilariously innocent, in comparison to everything else they\u2019ve done together \u2014 but this isn\u2019t <em>a</em> <em>master and his plaything, </em> it\u2019s just them, right now. He\u2019s kissing a snot nosed nerd, borderline child-genius, Japan\u2019s strongest <em> Deku.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Izuku cradles the back of his head and Katsuki melts entirely. That\u2019s the last straw; he\u2019s done for. Katsuki deepens the kiss with a turn of his head and Izuku makes a pleased humming noise, and it buzzes in Katsuki\u2019s ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s lips are soft, but cracked from insistent biting, and Katsuki tries biting it for him \u2014 and Izuku parts his lips without being asked. Katsuki cups his jaw and there\u2019s no leather barrier, nothing stopping him from feeling over old acne scars and high cheekbones. The tales about fireworks and butterflies are such horseshit, because nobody told him it was real.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re still leaning over their crossed laps. Eventually Izuku leans away, just enough so Katsuki can straighten his spine. The sticky sound is erotic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I just have <em> you</em>?\u201d Izuku asks gently. He chews his cheek and blinks as his face reddens. \u201cI mean, can it just be us right now?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki wants that so badly, he doesn\u2019t even have the words to describe how much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. God yeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles against his mouth and tugs at his shirt, and Katsuki leans back long enough for Izuku to pop it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love what you do to me, but \u2014 lately all I ever think about is touching you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki does <em> not </em>blush. He doesn\u2019t. Get your eyes checked.</p>\n<p>He growls back. \u201cWhatever you want, you can have it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku takes him up on that offer. They readjust so Katsuki is leaning back against the headboard, and Izuku crawls to straddle his lap, and Katsuki\u2019s pulse is pounding in his ears, but the adrenaline makes him feel high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku kisses him again. Katsuki holds him steady by the waist, and when their tongues meet his heart does backflips like a fucking teenager. Izuku\u2019s sudden moan vibrates into his teeth, and by <em> god </em>does it turn Katsuki on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having Izuku touch him is a religious experience. Katsuki is the one usually doing the work, so he has a hard time focusing as Izuku feels up his chest, mapping out reverent circles with his knobby fingertips. He squeezes his pecs, his shoulders, his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI sweat a lot,\u201d Katsuki admits, stomach clenching when Izuku pets down his abdominal muscles. \u201cFair warning.\u201d No biggie, it\u2019s not like his sweat is an explosive material, or anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Izuku giggles, and the kiss to his temple is so sweet it rots his teeth. \u201cIs it weird to say I like it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, you,\u201d Katsuki growls, and he gets a firm grip on the back of Izuku\u2019s unruly hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that they\u2019ve crossed that line, it\u2019s like they can\u2019t stop kissing. Katsuki gets his left hand down the back of Izuku\u2019s underwear, but their lips don\u2019t stop, and it\u2019s a whole other sensation he has to process. The sound of Izuku pulling the zip on his jeans is oddly arousing, and Katsuki is on <em> fire \u2014 </em>he must be, because he\u2019s burning alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so,\u201d Izuku kisses, \u201cso, <em> so </em>attractive, Kacchan. I love that you\u2019re so much bigger than me. I love how strong you are. I love everything about you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the most <em> Izuku </em>compliment that Katsuki has ever received, and it makes him snort. Izuku\u2019s eyes roll back when Katsuki kneads his fingers into the meat of his ass, and Katsuki feels drunk when he licks into the side of Izuku\u2019s neck and bites down. His skin tastes good; salty and human.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me to tell you what I think of you, nerd.\u201d</p>\n<p>All the praise, the compliments, the sweet nothings; of course they were true.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku has the nerve to blink those big bambi eyes at him, while having the body of an Adonis god.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou meant all that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to \u2014 fuck off, just kiss me, asshole.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t have the patience for tricks tonight. Izuku pulls them out of their underwear and jacks them off in one hand, and Katsuki gets to spend his brainpower working a very complicated network of bruises into Izuku\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Izuku leans over long enough to grab lube, and when Katsuki asks about a condom, Izuku shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s fine, just let me ride you, <em> please.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s head thunks against the headboard when Izuku sinks down onto him. Katsuki has zero control over the groan he makes; it\u2019s guttural and loud. Izuku is tight from the sloppy prep, but he doesn\u2019t even flinch \u2014 just rocks back and forth and begs for Katsuki\u2019s mouth on him, so he dives to kiss him again.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cNgh! </em>Fuck me,\u201d Katsuki grits. \u201cYou\u2019re tight as all fuck, Deku.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs shallowly, and flicks his hair out of his eyes as he rides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ahh. </em>I-I never thought I\u2019d hear that name in bed.\u201d Izuku bounces, purring, \u201cMmm, damn your dick is fat, I can feel it in my stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki growls into his ear, biting the cartilage and pulling, and Izuku grips his biceps and moans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho taught you to talk nasty like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHah\u2026 I wonder?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sloppy and slow, Izuku sitting up just enough for his cock to catch on his rim, then sliding back down to his thighs, and Katsuki\u2019s eyes are going to roll out of his fucking <em> skull, </em>it\u2019s so excruciatingly good. The slapping sounds are loud, sudden, erotic, spaced out slow and deep, and Katsuki can feel their skin sticking together from the sweat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is taking what he wants, Katsuki realizes. He\u2019s being used, he\u2019s actually <em> wanted \u2014 </em>and it\u2019s overwhelming. Katsuki can\u2019t kiss him enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s noises are soft and so overwhelmingly genuine that Katsuki realizes that he\u2019s not going to last.\u00a0 He covers Izuku\u2019s hand with his own, and pumps him fast enough to get Izuku to cry out and finish not a second before him, crying <em> ah, ah, Kacchan \u2014\u00a0</em>and Katsuki will never be able to hear that nickname again. He doesn\u2019t have enough walls up right now to tamper down the low sound he makes as he orgasms, and it hits so hard his heels dig out into the mattress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the skin-on-skin is simultaneously overwhelming, and anti-climatic. Like a stupid realization of <em> oh, they could\u2019ve been doing this the whole time, huh?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Izuku smiles into his lips again and Katsuki doesn\u2019t comment on how wet both their lashes are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like your voice. You should let go more often.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki pinches his nose and squeezes hard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better shut up before I kill you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs nasally, and it sounds relieved. Very relieved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki wipes them down with a discarded shirt. They both get up long enough to take a piss and wash up; then they throw on boxers, before crawling right back in bed.</p>\n<p>Izuku lays against his side while Katsuki scrolls through the TV guide. They end up on some shitty baking channel, but Katsuki is only half focused, his brain fuzzy and distracted by the circles Izuku is tracing lazily against his sternum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re dating?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki turns his head to raise an eyebrow at him. Someone on TV burns their souffle. It cuts to a commercial with stupid Half n\u2019 Half talking about soup kitchens for brats, so Katsuki mutes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell \u2014 do you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki looks back to the television. Izuku\u2019s fingers stall, so Katsuki covers them with his own to keep his hand there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThought I was aro for a long time,\u201d Katsuki admits. \u201cBut I \u2014 dammit. Everything\u2019s always different when it comes to you anyways.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku threads their fingers together. Katsuki can feel scar tissue and crooked fingers, long broken and healed (a bit like them, Katsuki would say, if he was the poetic type).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to try?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a million ways this could blow up in his face, but Katsuki is anything but a coward. He\u2019ll face that shit head on, when they get there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Go out with me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grins and hooks a thick thigh over his own, crossing his ankle around Katsuki\u2019s calf because he can\u2019t quite reach his toes. Their legs are fuzzy and covered in scars, and this all feels alarmingly intimate.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you want, baby,\u201d Katsuki blurts, and then pauses with embarrassment. Izuku snickers, and flops his head onto Katsuki\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, I told you. It\u2019s all the same person in there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, if I want to be psychoanalyzed I\u2019ll go back to therapy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku hums. The feeling of Izuku\u2019s thumb petting over his own gives Katsuki goosebumps, which is stupid in retrospect, but Katsuki is weak right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKito-san stopped by, earlier.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Record scratch. Katsuki starts to hack and cough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fucking what?!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI told him we were dating to scare him off,\u201d Izuku admits. \u201cI guess it\u2019s not a lie anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKito came <em> here? </em>What the hell did he want?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was trying to get you back,\u201d Izuku frowns, and the possessiveness in his voice is suddenly very hot. \u201cHe was nice but I don\u2019t like him by principle.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t into him like that,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cIt was just sex.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. Maybe I should have you give him Fang-san\u2019s number.\u201d Izuku rolls over onto his chest, and blocks his view of the TV as he peers down at Katsuki. \u201cWhat did you do to him, by the way?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki grins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing permanent.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201c--fight of the century!

Izuku is sweet, but he carries that <em> tell me no and find out the consequences </em> kind of energy. He really would be a good brat, but he\u2019s too much of a people pleaser.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike we aren\u2019t already?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A heavy sigh follows, and their manager shakes the flower petals off her fingers to pick up her pen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a week, and a raise.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re only getting one of those.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAww thank you.

But they\u2019re always changing these days, call it character development or getting older. Your choice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them are the fancy restaurant type, so for The First Date they end up eating noodles at Kono\u2019s again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wore your hoodie this time,\u201d Izuku beams.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shows off an orange and black <em> Ground Zero </em> hoodie. Izuku\u2019s hair is all fluffed out from the post-shift shower, and his lip is split from a fight earlier that day (not like Katsuki can ignore the swollen elbow and the black eye he earned, but they\u2019ve been busy as hell, so midnight noodles are the best they can do right now).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is still smiling at him. The painful way that Katsuki\u2019s chest tightens is a sure confirmation that he is very capable of romantic attraction. Er, not like he\u2019ll say that out loud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. You can throw the other ones away.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I demand it?\u201d Katsuki asks, raising his eyebrows. Izuku narrows his eyes and stirs his straw in his glass in a way that could be described as menacing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll demand my foot up your butt.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>That catches Katsuki so off guard that he laughs. Izuku immediately softens and giggles, leaning back so that he\u2019s still hidden by the giant houseplant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel any different from how we usually hang out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it supposed to?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never dated my best friend.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Katsuki hooks his ankle around the leg of Izuku\u2019s chair and yanks, and Izuku yips as he\u2019s hauled closer. Gripped by the chin, Katsuki turns his head and forces a quick kiss, before scooting backwards again. The waitress stops by to refill their drinks, and Izuku sizzles pink from across the table. \u201cFeel like a date <em> now?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Izuku presses his hands to his face and gurgles a sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are fucking ridiculous. I\u2019ve had four fingers up your ass.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, I <em> swear. </em> I\u2019ll never take you out in public again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki snorts, and decides to spare him, picking at his teeth with a toothpick. He rolls it around his tongue for a moment, until Izuku is no longer a primary color.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about our contract?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, what about it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still wanna\u2019 sub?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku scratches his cheek. He\u2019s a little stubbly, like he forgot to shave this morning, and it\u2019s endearing (also frustrating, because Katsuki can\u2019t grow anything other than a fuzzy chin, so thanks for the shit genes, dad).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku lowers his voice, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to <em> stop. </em>But um, it doesn\u2019t have to be every time, you know?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. I agree.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m also\u2026\u201d Izuku hesitates. He rubs his nose. \u201cI\u2019m not against trying some new stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises his eyebrows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I trust you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki thinks about how painful it was to hear Izuku call his safeword. He\u2019s not <em> afraid </em>(he ain\u2019t afraid of nothing, got it?!) but he\u2019s definitely hesitant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after last time?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was...different. I wasn\u2019t in a good place.\u201d</p>\n<p>That eases Katsuki\u2019s worries (not that he had any).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to communicate that to me if it happens again, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki pets over his front teeth with his tongue, and after a moment, he hooks his ankle around Izuku\u2019s under the table. Watching Izuku\u2019s hands fiddle with his drink is getting Katsuki hot, for some reason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna dip after this?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles bashfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spread out and in the afterglow, Izuku crawls over him to look Katsuki right in the eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s something I\u2019d really like to try.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki raises his eyebrows, but stays where he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, flex your arm for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki blinks slowly, waiting to see if Izuku will go <em> ha ha, sike! </em>But Izuku is leering down at him with a very serious expression, so Katsuki sighs and flexes his right arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku swiftly leans down, and takes a big chomp out of his bicep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d Katsuki startles. \u201cWhat the hell was that?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have the best arms,\u201d Izuku whines. \u201cThey\u2019re so big I just want to\u2014\u201d He takes a second bite into the muscle, and Katsuki struggles to throw him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"That <em> hurts, </em>you fucker!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an apple!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!

Some of the extras are married and shit, and hero work is a full time job, you know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their old class still makes an effort to gather every once in a while, and Katsuki is usually dragged along kicking and screaming, but he\u2019ll never admit that he doesn\u2019t mind it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is currently refereeing a game of beer pong with his nerd friends, and he\u2019s not allowed to play anymore, because they discovered in their third year that Izuku has the ability to drink anyone under the table. Icyhot is convinced that it\u2019s another quirk of his, but Katsuki knows it\u2019s his overdrive metabolism. Katsuki will not admit that it\u2019s sexy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Ochaco groans. \u201cIzuku, can you just take mine for me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s cheating!\u201d Aoyama points.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <em> throw up </em>if I drink one more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it here,\u201d Izuku laughs, and knocks back the beer for her. Katsuki feels his mouth water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina is currently kicking ass at a FPS, and all the shouting is a good distraction for Katsuki to beckon Izuku over. He looks like a little frat boy in his socks and slides, gym shorts and a hoodie, and Katsuki could just eat him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHiii,\u201d Izuku sings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome sit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCause you\u2019re the one that made me waste my Saturday night,\u201d Katsuki says, tugging him sideways into his lap. Izuku laughs, and slings an arm over his shoulders. \u201cI could be fucking you stupid right now.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Izuku slaps a hand over his mouth. \u201cOh my gosh, Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all heard that,\u201d Shouto says, and Katsuki ignores him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite your hand off if you touch my face again.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku pats his head in a <em> yes yes I know, down boy </em>motion, and Katsuki snaps his teeth at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou amaze me, Midoriya,\u201d Eijirou laughs. \u201cI have no idea how you tamed him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a system,\u201d Izuku says, and Katsuki thinks about how good it\u2019s going to feel to slap his ass until it glows red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBadabing badaboom,\u201d Mina sings, setting down her controller and cracking her fingers. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eijirou slides off the couch and onto the floor. \u201cUhh, I\u2019ll try.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it dude,\u201d Denki warns, rubbing his eyes. \u201cShe just rawdogged me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got the strap,\u201d Mina mimes. \u201cI keep that shit on me,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki and Denki roll their eyes simultaneously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bottom.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!

Best Jeanist used to say <em> \u2018everything needs some kind of balance\u2019, </em>and it\u2019s true, may the bastard rest in peace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes they\u2019re master and pet, sometimes they\u2019re lovers, sometimes they\u2019re Kacchan and Deku, and sometimes they\u2019re none of that, and that\u2019s okay. If the wonder-duo can pride themselves on anything, it\u2019s the ability to <em> adapt.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>But still. Katsuki is a little ticked off, because he had a very serious plan to hang Izuku by the ceiling and overstim him until he passed out \u2014 and now that\u2019s gone out the window, because he\u2019s been thrown through a six-story building and broke both legs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Katsuki spits, slamming his fist against the ground. \u201cWhat a shit Friday.\u201d\u00a0 A foot steps on his sternum, Katsuki coughs, and the villain laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>This </em>is the mighty Ground Zero? A lot of bark, for a dumb dog.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to learn some bedside manners,\u201d Katsuki grits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAny last words?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, enjoy your funeral, asshole.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And on cue, the villain is tackled right off of Katsuki\u2019s chest, then kicked straight into the ground so deep it creates a human-sized crater. The rest of the gang-members stop to stare, pausing their raid on the city.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoss!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku is back at Katsuki\u2019s side, crouched defensively and nearly foaming at the mouth. Katsuki can almost taste the green lightning hissing around the air. The killing intent makes all the hair on his arms stand on end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s voice drops to a growl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em> not </em>touch him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo predictable,\u201d Katsuki sighs. His in-ear buzzes to life with laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cAyo dude, you cool?\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHe\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just reading a few broken bones, no internal bleeding.\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cBastard, you scared us!\u201d\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku turns, and the terrifying look on his face melts into soft concern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki flops back on the pavement and rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine.

It hurts like all hell, but he isn\u2019t about to give up the opportunity to watch an unhinged Deku kick ass without restraint. He\u2019s hot when he\u2019s mad. Oh yeah, he\u2019s definitely got plans for next weekend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThat\u2019s so romantic.

Ice creeps up the side of the building, so he flips Half-n\u2019-Half off too, while he\u2019s at it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, he missed the click of the windowsill. Katsuki chooses to blame it on whatever drugs they\u2019re pumping him with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stirs to the feeling of fingers in his hair. Katsuki tenses, then relaxes immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Katsuki mumbles. \u201cIsn\u2019t this ironic. You here to break me out?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku whispers. \u201cEven though we really shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good as new anyways,\u201d Katsuki slaps his leg. It <em> hurts, </em> but it ain\u2019t broken anymore. \u201cOvernights are such BS. <em> \u2018Monitor your health\u2019\u00a0</em>my ass.\u201d He hates the smells of hospitals, too. Floor cleaner shouldn\u2019t make your damn eyes burn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me about it and \u2014 <em> don\u2019t </em>hit your leg like that. Keep your voice down, I think the nurses are still doing wellness checks.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls a change of clothes out of his bag, and Katsuki wads up the hospital gown and stuffs it under the sheets. When he\u2019s got his pants on, Izuku holds out an arm, and Katsuki narrows his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku pouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, come on. You can\u2019t run off barefoot and I didn\u2019t have time to \u2014\u201d a noise clatters outside, and Izuku ducks down, lowering his voice even further. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to grab your shoes. Just get on!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki glares long enough to tell him how <em> not </em> happy he is about this \u2014 but he\u2019d much rather sleep in his own room than this piece of shit cardboard they call a <em> hospital bed.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Izuku carries him like he\u2019s nothing but a backpack. Katsuki grips around his neck, and Izuku slips them out the window, landing light on his feet and jumping back up to the rooftop to stay out of sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku <em> \u2018flies\u2019 </em>differently than Katsuki does; more of his balance resides in his legs, in comparison to Katsuki\u2019s explosions emitting from his hands \u2014 and if you aren\u2019t used to it, riding along can give you whiplash. Katsuki just laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTriss is gonna\u2019 be <em> so </em>pissed tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grips him tighter by the thighs, and hops the gaps between rooftops. The wind rustles their hair, and blows through their clothes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah. You\u2019re dealing with that one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?! You\u2019re the one that broke me out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the <em> favorite,</em>\u201d Izuku says over the wind, and Katsuki pinches his ribs with his knees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em> so </em>in trouble. Ten strikes for you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about a <em> thank you Izuku, for breaking me out of health prison.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Katsuki bites the back of his ear, which might as well mean the same thing. Deku ain\u2019t gotta\u2019 know that, though. He swats back at Katsuki like a mosquito and laughs, and Katsuki bites his other ear, to match.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki spent all week waiting for his package to come in, and an additional three days for their schedule to clear up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve had sex, but they haven\u2019t had a serious session since Katsuki busted his legs (roughly two weeks ago, the healers fixed \u2018em, it\u2019s fine), and Katsuki wants to try a different approach this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s torture sitting in the same office as Izuku for six hours, but he\u2019s not going to be the one to break first. Katsuki knows that Izuku is shooting him frustrated looks, but Katsuki refuses to let this affect his work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re changing out of uniform to go home, the locker room is full of heroes, so Katsuki can\u2019t squeeze his ass like he wants to. Instead he bumps Izuku by the elbow, and sits at the bench to tie his shoes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku already knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku was given a house key weeks ago, so Katsuki is on him the very second he walks through the door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This relationship has made him fucking pathetic<em>, </em>and Katsuki can\u2019t stand it, but also, a part of growing up has been learning that it\u2019s okay to be weak sometimes, and fuck if Izuku isn\u2019t one of the better things in his life right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki wraps his arms around Izuku, bends down to jam his face in his throat, and Izuku makes a happy sound, dropping his bag to the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm, I missed you too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got you something, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>With just one pet name, Izuku\u2019s back straightens. He rolls his head to the side, inviting Katsuki to nip and suck and kiss behind his ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm, you wanna\u2019 try it on for me, sweetheart?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles and nods, and Katsuki leads him away by the hip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It fits tight in some places, but Katsuki thinks that just makes it better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon, give me a twirl.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku turns for him. Leather straps hook around his waist, down his thighs, across his chest and up to the collar at his neck. Cuffs fit snug around his wrists and his ankles, with little dangly clips just waiting to be used. Katsuki likes the sheer black miniskirt in particular, it goes with the lingerie \u2014 and the way Izuku\u2019s body fits it is both masculine and feminine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has some old bruises from work, but that\u2019s okay. Katsuki will paint him some new ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, that was made for you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, master,\u201d Izuku smiles. \u201cI love it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBend over for me? Hands on the floor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku does, and <em> fuck. </em>Fuck. It doesn\u2019t look like much of a stretch for him, but it forces his thighs to squish around the straps, and Katsuki pinches the skin there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, babydoll. I want you to stay like that for me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gasps, holds his breath and then nods, and Katsuki kneels down to clip Izuku\u2019s wrists to his ankles. He makes a startled sound, and Katsuki hums at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You can hold that for me, can\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The chain doesn\u2019t give Izuku much room. He\u2019s forced to keep his palms flat to the floor, right between his feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Katsuki says, and kneels behind him to yank aside the lingerie and eat him out for half an hour. It\u2019s a good use of his time, and Katsuki waits until Izuku is shaking like a leaf and on the border of collapse before he stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSir please \u2014 please <em> please </em> touch me, <em> please!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like brats,\u201d Katsuki reminds nicely, and takes a fat bite into his ass. Izuku yips. \u201cYou don\u2019t decide when I touch you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Yes sir!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gives Izuku\u2019s back a break by reclipping him to the bed, spread eagle and laid out like a meat platter, and Katsuki tugs on his straps and plays with his mouth and teases him until he\u2019s putty, and it's therapeutic for both of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki decided to ditch the gloves from the get go, and it\u2019s different because Katsuki can kiss him now, slow and deep and tortuous, keeping him hard for hours on end, until Katsuki decides to strip off his own clothes and straddle his lap, rubbing Izuku\u2019s swollen cock against his ass. The downright shocked look on Izuku\u2019s face is amazing. Izuku had no idea that he\u2019s stretched, and his bedposts go <em> creeeeak </em>as Izuku yanks suddenly. He lights up in teal lightning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No! </em> Master I can\u2019t \u2014 I won\u2019t last! <em> Ah! Ah! </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay baby,\u201d Katsuki sinks down, forcing back the strain in his voice. Ah, it\u2019s been a while.\u00a0 \u201cYou can cum in your master, I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s okay sweetheart.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku <em> sobs, </em>and one of the buckles snap on his wrists, and Katsuki only gets a dozen bounces in before Izuku curls up and orgasms, his spine arching up off the bed. Katsuki quickly jacks himself off, gasping as Izuku\u2019s hips jerk up sporadically, and Izuku breaks the rule and uses his freed hand to help finish Katsuki off. He shoots right up between Izuku\u2019s tits, right across the leather straps and jagged pink scars. Hell yeah.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is repeating <em> oh my gosh, oh my gosh </em>over and over, and Katsuki grins down at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGotcha\u2019.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku flops his head back and squeezes his eyes shut. Katsuki runs his fingers through the cum on Izuku\u2019s chest, and forces it into his mouth. Izuku complains at first, but Katsuki forces him to comply, and eventually Izuku relaxes, licking slowly between each finger until Katsuki\u2019s hand is clean. Katsuki finally slips off him and winces at the twinge in his back. He sits on Izuku\u2019s thighs, and rubs his sides soothingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood job, baby.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve died.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Katsuki has clicked all the straps off, Izuku hauls him down by the shoulders, cuddling Katsuki to his chest like a teddy bear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Katsuki snaps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm, you taught me this,\u201d Izuku mumbles. <em> \u201cAftercare is important </em>, you said.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki goes <em> hmm</em>, but allows Izuku to snuff and purr into his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s voice is distant and floaty, but he\u2019s conscious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. That outfit is going to make for some really interesting bruises tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cToo tight?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm, yeah. Felt good. Thank you, daddy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s stomach clenches so hard, his dick twitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> god. </em> Deku don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku grins sleepily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? That gets you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll call master whatever he likes~\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki muffles his mouth with his hand, and Izuku giggles insistently, licking his palm until Katsuki\u2019s patience runs out, prying open his lips and spitting in his mouth. Izuku squeaks and thrashes, and it quickly turns into a round two.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Mine, </em>Katsuki\u2019s lizard brain repeats.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0~</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<em>\"-scandalous photos leaked of Heroes Ground Zero and Deku perched on a rooftop.

I mean, they'd just kicked [beep] in Shibuya. I don't really care what -\"\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Damn right we did,\" Katsuki grits, and Suds turns off the TV.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Well,\" Eijirou grins, leaning over the bar, face flushed. \"Alls well that ends well, right?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Fuck you, I had it under control.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Uh huh. Just watch your back, you've got the whole country watching your every move right now.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Katsuki huffs, \"Ain't that what I got you for?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Eijirou pauses, and then his eyes go all big and sparkly.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"I\u00a0<em>hate\u00a0</em>you, wipe that stupid look off your face or I'll do it for you - what's this?\" Katsuki looks up, as Suds passes him another shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"On the house,\" Suds says. \"For taking that hit in front of the bar. Don't think I didn't notice, I still watch the news behind your back, kid.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Katsuki looks down at the shot, then raises his eyebrows.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Don't think this means I like you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Uh huh.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Katsuki drinks it, and Eijirou laughs all bubbly.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Don\u2019t mind him, Suds. Kats is a real friendly guy, once you get past the first hundred layers of bullshit.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Jeez. How many layers are there?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Definitely more than a hundred. I'm twenty-years in and still working my way through them all.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">They turn at the sound of a new voice. Izuku waves, and Katsuki pouts as Izuku worms an arm around his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"What are you doing here? I told ya' I'd meet you at home.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Sorry to intrude on your\u00a0<em>guy time.\u00a0</em>I was just passing by on the way to the grocery store.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"First of all,\" Katsuki raises a finger. \"Don't call it that ever again and second,\u00a0<em>what?\u00a0</em>The hell?

That's not happening.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Hey Midoriya!\" Eijirou talks over Katsuki, clapping Izuku's hand in a hello. Suds waves, and Izuku waves back, still leaning on Katsuki's shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Hi! I'm Izuku.\"</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Oh, I know who you are.\"</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Awww Kacchan, are you out here making friends?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"No. Shut up.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Of course he is, the little social butterfly~\" Eijirou coos.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"You're all dead to me. Deku, we're leaving and I\u2019m doing your grocery shopping.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">Suds\u2019 hair bubbles, and he taps the counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Hey, let me get you a drink, at least.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"Oh! Is that alright? Kacchan looks like he wants to leave.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"He's just embarrassed,\" Eijirou pokes Katsuki, like a bear. \"He was telling us how much he\u00a0<em>wuuuved you.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Katsuki explodes, popping off the barstool and igniting his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\"<em>I was not you little dirty fucking liar!!\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p align=\"left\">Izuku laughs, and accepts the drink from Suds. Eijirou hardens to shield himself from the blows, and Suds slaps the counter and says, <em>\"Aye! No strangling people in my damn bar!\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Learning to accept love and affection in his day-to-day life is a boundary that Katsuki is still trying to cross. Izuku is one of the strongest men on planet earth, so it can\u2019t <em> possibly </em>be a weakness, but an old, damaged part of Katsuki\u2019s brain still tells him it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mentally, Katsuki is stronger than most. You see a lot of fucked up shit in hero work \u2014 and it ain\u2019t good for the squeamish, that\u2019s for sure. UA exposed him to enough nightmares to last a lifetime, so most crap Katsuki can handle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku is good at search and rescue \u2014 that dumbass smile plastered on his face, his sweet way of talking someone down from shock like <em> no, no don\u2019t look down, just look at me, I\u2019ve got you, okay? </em> And Katsuki isn\u2019t so great at being that nice, but he\u2019s damn good at his job, so he takes the <em> win to save, save to win </em>very seriously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Katsuki was never mentally prepared for the day he\u2019d have to rush in to save his parents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t seen them since the holidays; they ain\u2019t that kind of family to begin with, but they\u2019re still his folks, and seein\u2019 them held up at gunpoint is traumatizing enough as it is. Thankfully his training kicks in, and by the time Izuku is done talking down the shooter, Katsuki has enough time to grab the hostages and hightail it out of there. The following fight is a bit ugly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad is a little bruised, but fine. Mom is just pissed, but that\u2019s how it goes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry for getting in the way, kid,\u201d Mom pats his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki shrugs off her hand, \u201cMah, fuck off. Don\u2019t get into any more trouble.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dad laughs, and Mom digs her knuckles into the top of his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! We should be sayin\u2019 that to you, dumbass.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki should\u2019ve known that his parents wouldn\u2019t be shaken up so easily, but Katsuki is tired, he\u2019s fucking <em> tired, </em>and Izuku swoops in to save the day, setting a hand at Katsuki\u2019s shoulder and bowing to his parents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr and Mrs Bakugou! I\u2019m so sorry for the trouble! Are you both alright?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes yes, of course!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBarely a scratch. We\u2019re so honored to be rescued by the <em> pros, </em>haha. How\u2019ve you been, Izuku? Katsuki hasn\u2019t been too much of an ass, has he?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo \u2014 no, not at all!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki zones out. He\u2019s not mentally present for much of the police report, and when his parents say goodbye, he can barely get it together long enough to see them off. Izuku gives them the rundown about a trauma counsellor and blah blah blah, Katsuki just can\u2019t stop seeing the <em> gun, </em>and it\u2019s pissing him off that he is this shaken up by a villain that didn\u2019t even take casualties.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki has seen arms ripped off, has seen skin melt off bone, has stopped mass <em> murderers </em>in broad daylight, but something about today has just tipped him over that edge. Izuku looks worried, and it makes Katsuki mad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. Are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Katsuki shrugs him off. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 home. M\u2019 tired.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku frowns, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll finish up here, so don\u2019t worry about the report.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re careful about PDA on the job, but Izuku gives him a firm squeeze on the shoulder, and Katsuki barely feels it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not even sure how he gets home. He doesn\u2019t even shower. Katsuki\u2019s head is just up and gone, and it must\u2019ve been hours by the time he hears a key turning in his door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d Izuku whispers. \u201cAre you still awake?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hmm. It\u2019s late, isn\u2019t it? Katsuki checks the time and yeah, neary one in the morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhataya\u2019 want?\u201d Katsuki calls from the kitchen. Izuku wanders in and shuts the door behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I just \u2014 I wanted to check on you, and you weren\u2019t answering your phone and I could tell you were a little uh...well, of course you handled everything just fine, you\u2019re a professional! But um, you just looked...<em> upset?\u201d </em>Izuku flinches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki digs his butterknife into a tub of frosting, and licks it off the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home, I don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pity. It's concern, because I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki pauses. Izuku sets down his bag, and approaches his spot on the barstool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re coming up on four months since the contract began. It feels like a lifetime ago, but also just yesterday. Katsuki hates how much better he feels, just by seeing Izuku in front of him. He fucking hates it so much, his chest burns and crushes his lungs. Katsuki jams his knife in the tub and shoves the chocolate in this mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku approaches, \u201cOh honey, let's put down the frosting, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki growls, yanking the frosting away from his grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off! Don\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku frowns, and Katsuki tries to push him away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood right now. I\u2019m fine, so just go home.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t fazed, because of course he isn\u2019t. His eyes get big and sparkly, like he knows it\u2019s Katsuki\u2019s weak point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. You don\u2019t have to talk about it, but...you\u2019re still a mess. Will you let me clean you up?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even with his head as fuzzy as it is, Katsuki\u2019s defenses still fly up like a shield.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em> need \u2014</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku says, and his eyes water, and Katsuki\u2019s heart clenches. \u201cTrust me, I know. But you take such good care of me, and I can see it in your face, Kacchan, you\u2019re exhausted. Just let me \u2014 let me do the same for you. I know how you feel, I <em> really </em>do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki didn\u2019t even realize that the terrible pressure in his chest was the verge of a panic attack. He swallows it back, doesn\u2019t let it crack on his face, but Izuku\u2019s hands rest at his outer thighs, and the warmth spreads up his leg and into his sternum. Katsuki\u2019s voice cracks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not weak.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m weak, when you take care of me?\u201d Izuku asks. Katsuki swallows, and sticks the knife back in the frosting very slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why would I think that way about you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t answer. Izuku prods the tub out of his hands, and sets it on the counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll run a bath for you. Come on.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s hands are familiar in his. Katsuki allows himself to be tugged into the bathroom. He feels drugged, oversensitive, sore and annoyed and his <em> brain </em>won\u2019t stop running all the stupid what if\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gets him out of his clothes, and convinces Katsuki to sit in the bathtub. He drags out the soaps from under the sink, and makes it smell nice and sweet before shucking his own clothes and crawling in behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki thinks about the last time he did this for Izuku, and how much has changed since then. Izuku\u2019s legs bracket him in and it\u2019s <em> comforting, </em>it feels safe, and Katsuki can hardly believe it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t ask him to talk. He just washes his hair in sections, scooping water with his hands scrubbing with his blunt nails, and eventually the anger in his mouth pools out and is lost to the soapy water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can lean back on me,\u201d Izuku prods gently. Katsuki lets Izuku take his weight, and the water sloshes over the edge. They\u2019re both too big for his dumb bathtub, but Izuku wraps his arms tight around his waist, and Katsuki forgets who he is, lulled completely out of his own mind. Katsuki\u2019s voice comes out raw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why this is fucking me up so bad.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had to be strong for weeks,\u201d Izuku pets his damp hair, pushing it away from his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working forty-eight hour shifts. It rubs down anyone.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut not me,\u201d Katsuki mumbles. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be me. I\u2019m gonna\u2019 be number one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The echo makes the bathroom feel bigger than it is. Katsuki\u2019s feet cram up against the edge of the tub, and Izuku\u2019s bodyheat is warmer than the bathwater.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only stayed sane because of my friends, my mom, and the fact that you\u2019ve been there to support me,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cI want to be that for you too. A relationship goes both ways.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> A relationship.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The word still tastes new. Out of all the people Katsuki has fucked, has strung up in rope and forced on their knees \u2014 Izuku is his first <em> boyfriend. </em>It\u2019s strange, but it could never be anyone else, except him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t reply at first. He looks at where their knees jut out of the water. Where an old scar crosses Katsuki\u2019s thigh, and starts up again on Izuku\u2019s calf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents shouldn\u2019t have been there,\u201d Katsuki mumbles. \u201cThey should\u2019ve been at home, watching Jeopardy and eating crap TV dinners.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou handled everything perfectly<em>, </em>\u201d Izuku assures patiently, but without the bullshit. \u201cRight to code, like a real pro. I\u2019d call you out, if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>His words feel nice, and soothing. Is this how it feels, for Izuku? The loss of control is scary, but Katsuki is no longer on the edge of a breakdown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Katsuki mutters. He gets Izuku\u2019s fingers threaded in his own, and the knot in his stomach unravels a little. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Izuku teases. \u201cEspecially when you have so much dirt on <em> me. </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki cracks a smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right I do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cSo so much, I feel like I\u2019m going to burst sometimes, even when you\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki turns his head on Izuku\u2019s shoulder. He can see the line of his jaw, the curve of his nose and all the old acne scars, and Katsuki gets close enough to mouth over the mole on his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku swallows, and squeezes his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s silly. Where would I go?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno. I love you too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku freezes, rigid against the tub, before he jerks to squeeze Katsuki so tight his ribs creak. He hates that he can hear the tears in his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you \u2014 thank you for telling me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cShut up, </em>god. We\u2019re not making a habit of this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always going to protect you, in the same way you protect me,\u201d Izuku tells him. \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s who I am.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki knows. Oh, does he. The sludge monster comes to mind \u2014 a quirkless, fourteen year old boy running right to his death. Katsuki settles back into his shoulder, turned where he can jam his nose in Izuku\u2019s throat, where it smells the most like <em> him.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cGuess we ain\u2019t partners for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, daddy,\u201d Izuku says, and Katsuki jolts to squeeze him by the nose, jamming his fingers in Izuku\u2019s armpits and making him squeal until he apologizes properly, like a good boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Katsuki loses some walls that day, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing (or so his therapist says).</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, Deku.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think we could use black whip in a scene?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely <em> not, </em>are you serious?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just a fuckin\u2019 question, damn.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>.<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean.... logistically we could if... <em>hey! Put me down!\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em><br></em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
