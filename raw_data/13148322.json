  "text": "<p>The bullet woke him up.</p>\n<p>The bullet was a high-calibre ballistic type. It penetrated thick ice and then bounced off the adamantium over the bridge of his nose. Had that just been bone, it would have gone right into the brain. It was enough to pull him out of his dormant state. The first thing Logan noticed, as he extracted himself from the ice, was that his memories were all back. He supposed it was down to his body being dormant for so long, so it finally could devote energy to whatever in his brain had caused the amnesia.</p>\n<p>Logan didn\u2019t need to look very far to find who had shot him \u2013 and the four other guys. They were actually dead. The asshole seemed to be setting up for something. Logan could have pinned him and demanded answers, but he was curious. So, like the predator that was his namesake, Logan sat and waited. His healing factor starved off the freezing of his body in the sub-zero temperatures. The guy who\u2019d shot him sat there and listened to a woman\u2019s voicemail. The woman who\u2019d made it was most likely dead and this was probably a revenge kick.</p>\n<p>When they finally arrived, Logan was startled to see the old Walking Flag and his Sergeant babysitter and Tony Stark in some kind of power suit. He must\u2019ve missed a fair bit, because that was not the kid he\u2019d occasionally seen in the media \u2013 the kid who suddenly had too much responsibility and didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. This was a man, putting aside his differences with Rogers, which one often had to do, in order to fight some kind of threat.</p>\n<p>When they found the guy \u2013 Zemo, apparently \u2013 it was clear what had happened. This was a very elaborate trap for Rogers and Stark. Something about tearing the Avengers apart, whatever that was about. The conversation and the situation in the room made it easy for Logan to fill in a lot of the gaps.</p>\n<p>Then the video was played.</p>\n<p>Logan had heard that Howard Stark had crashed his car, killing both himself and his wife and leaving their teenaged son an orphan. That was not what happened in this video tape though. No, what Logan saw was a set-up assassination. Apparently what these fuckers had tried to do to him, they had done to the Sergeant.</p>\n<p>Logan had never been close to his parents \u2013 could barely remember them in fact. But Stark hadn\u2019t been. In fact, he\u2019d been a typical baseline human teenager. He had lost his parents at an age where he wasn\u2019t ready to be on his own. Now, years later, he was learning that he had not merely lost them. They had been <em>taken</em> from him...by a man standing just a few feet away from him.</p>\n<p>The instant the video finished, Stark\u2019s eyes turned to Barnes. Cap\u2019s face was concerned, but not surprised. He\u2019d clearly already known. Stark took a step towards Barnes. Cap grabbed his arm. \u2018Tony, it wasn\u2019t him!\u2019 he insisted.</p>\n<p>The hell it wasn\u2019t! Maybe he\u2019d been brainwashed; hadn\u2019t known what he was doing. Maybe, but it was still the hands of Sergeant James Barnes which had bashed Howard Stark\u2019s face in and squeezed the throat of Maria Stark shut until she was dead. Diminished capacity did not absolve a man of murder.</p>\n<p>\u2018Did you know?\u2019 Stark demanded, voice tight.</p>\n<p>\u2018I didn\u2019t know it was him.\u2019 The chemical change in Cap told Logan the truth. His claws pulsated under his skin, just about begging to pop and tear into that dick.</p>\n<p>Stark knew it was a lie too. \u2018Don\u2019t bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes.\u2019</p>\n<p>Stark staggered back a step. Betrayal. It was something that Logan had become acquainted with early in life. As a small boy, back when his powers first manifested, many con artists and other assorted criminals had deemed him useful and systematically betrayed him. As a billionaire, though, Stark would taste betrayal over a longer period of time. People would use him for years and years before they stabbed him in the back.</p>\n<p>That was why a man in his forties of Stark\u2019s money and power looked so shocked \u2013 that and he\u2019d likely been raised on the legend of Captain America and hadn\u2019t thought this kind of thing in him.</p>\n<p>Stark jammed his eyes shut for a moment, and then he snapped. He swung his fist. The power-suit must\u2019ve been pretty impressive. (Well, of course it was. A Stark built it.) Rogers went flying. Barnes turned his gun on Stark. Logan growled as the fight broke out. He wasn\u2019t sure how much of his marbles Barnes still had, but fighting Stark at this moment was not the best thing to do. And Rogers\u2019 dickhead remarks didn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p><em>\u2018Leave him alone, Tony. He was forced to kill them.\u2019</em> As if Stark was capable of calming down now when all Rogers had done was escalate the situation.</p>\n<p><em>\u2018You know I wouldn\u2019t do this if I had another choice.\u2019</em> Idiot. He had another choice. He could have told Stark in a controlled environment and this wouldn\u2019t have happened. It wouldn\u2019t have been news to Stark.</p>\n<p>And the best of the bunch. <em>\u2018I could do this all day.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>There was a point in the end when Logan had enough. He\u2019d never liked Rogers. He was a stupid boy trying to play hero in the middle of a war. Now, he was about to take the head off of the son of the man who had given him all his toys. He was about to kill a grieving man who he had lied to for years. Logan didn\u2019t know about Stark \u2013 had always kind of pitied him to be honest \u2013 but one thing did cross his mind here.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This dickhead needs his ass kicked.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Logan leapt in, moving at top speed. With one hand, he snatched the shield out of Rogers\u2019 hand. With the other, he threw a hard punch into Rogers\u2019 jaw. He heard the distinctive crack of the bone. That would shut him up with some luck but it was only a fracture. Logan landed over Stark in a crouch. He tossed the shield at a wall, imbedding it into the concrete.</p>\n<p>The billionaire looked up at him surprised, but he remained where he was. He panted for air, relief and fear seeping out of his pores. Logan could hear the blood rushing in places it really shouldn\u2019t be. <em>Internal bleeding.</em> Rogers staggered to his feet. A nice bruise was already forming on his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 he demanded.</p>\n<p>\u2018I might be hurt at that if I gave a shit about you,\u2019 Logan said.</p>\n<p>Rogers grabbed his buddy\u2019s rifle from the ground. He let off the rounds. Logan shifted. The bullets pelted at him but bounced off his skeleton. Some of them went into his flesh, and were instantly pushed out by his healing factor. As they dropped, Stark turned his head.</p>\n<p>Rogers stared in disbelief. Of course all he could see was the healing of the tears in Logan\u2019s skin. Logan just stood there and let him observe the skin knit and repair itself. Barnes, missing his metal arm from the fight with Stark, was staring at Logan\u2019s face. Not the closing wounds like Rogers was, but his actual face. More likely than not, Barnes recognised Logan\u2019s face but he couldn\u2019t quite place where he knew it from.</p>\n<p>\u2018You finished?\u2019 Logan asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018How...?\u2019 Rogers began to ask.</p>\n<p><em>SNIKT!</em> Logan flicked his claws out.</p>\n<p>Rogers started. He cleared his throat. \u2018Sir, there\u2019s a lot happening here you don\u2019t understand.\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan smirked and cocked an eyebrow. Yup, that was him. Thought he knew it all and looked down on anyone who didn\u2019t agree with him and follow him like a loyal dog. He wasn\u2019t even going to dignify that with a response. Logan shot forward again. First he sliced apart the gun in Rogers\u2019 hand. Within a millisecond, he aimed and stabbed the Walking Flag in the gut. Rogers hacked, spitting blood, and fell back.</p>\n<p>Logan heard Barnes before he was there. The one-armed man grabbed a nearby stray pipe and swung it at Logan\u2019s head. Logan just lifted his claws and the pipe was cut into three pieces. With a quick slash down, Logan retracted one set of claws and punched Barnes into a wall. The guy\u2019s body impacted, leaving a sizeable dent, and he dropped to the floor. Blood pooled around his leg and he didn\u2019t get back up.</p>\n<p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t even move his leg and he\u2019d been in a mountain of pain.</p>\n<p>\u2018Bucky!\u2019 Rogers charged at Logan again.</p>\n<p>Logan sidestepped and grabbed Rogers by the skull. He hoisted him up. Logan knew Rogers put a lot of value on his height. Towering over someone was the oldest intimidation tactic in the book, and it was a favourite of Rogers\u2019. Logan had been on the receiving end back in the 40s, and Rogers had been quite annoyed that Logan hadn\u2019t been intimidated. Had, in fact, laughed and walked away. Well, it had been quite amusing.</p>\n<p>Rogers was a weak individual. Despite the physical strength, his entire sense of self-worth came from being \u201cspecial\u201d. Logan could have always ripped that away \u2013 so easily \u2013 and he didn\u2019t like the guy, but he\u2019d cared more about the backlash of doing such a thing. Mutants, especially the kids, dealt with enough shit on a daily basis without adding this dickhead on top.</p>\n<p>Rogers started talking again. \u2018You don\u2019t realise what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re fighting on the wrong side.\u2019 He continued nattering on, but Logan zoned out in favour of listening to Stark\u2019s vitals.</p>\n<p>There were no sides here. There was a grieving man who had been beaten half to death by the killer of his parents and a pretentious asshole who thought he could decide who was guilty and who was innocent. Now Logan had to finish this so the poor bugger didn\u2019t die. But he had the feeling Rogers wouldn\u2019t stop talking.</p>\n<p>Logan retracted his other set of claws. Rogers began talking faster, obviously thinking he was \u201cgetting through to him\u201d. It was getting on Logan\u2019s nerves, to be honest. <em>THWACK-CRACK!</em> This time, Logan made sure his punch broke Rogers\u2019 jaw. He also let go of Rogers\u2019 skull on impact, sending the living propaganda piece flying across the bunker. He hit the ground and dragged across the snow.</p>\n<p>\u2018You talk too much.\u2019 That said, Logan turned and walked towards Stark.</p>\n<p>Barnes gasped. \u2018Lucky James,\u2019 he whispered, finally placing where he knew Logan.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, yeah. I said that in the 40s too, didn\u2019t I?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Tony watched as his unexpected ally walk over and crouch down over him. The guy was wearing scrubs and didn\u2019t appear to be wearing anything else. Rightfully, his fingers and toes should have been freezing off \u2013 tinged blue at the very least. Of course, he had been shot at wildly and was unharmed. Same thing could be working against the cold.</p>\n<p>Tony couldn\u2019t deny he was curious about this guy who could beat the crap outta two super-soldiers. As the guy moved around him without a word, Tony considered it. Logically, he must\u2019ve been a prisoner here. Like those other four Win...Wait a minute. Wilson had said there were five Winter Soldiers. Why had only four been visible? This guy wasn\u2019t acting like a Winter Soldier \u2013 or at least what Tony had seen in Barnes.</p>\n<p>Tony heaved a sigh, which caused a spike of pain to shoot through his chest. He winced and swallowed. The other guy had brought Cap\u2019s shield over and was currently using it as a fire pot as he dropped anything flammable that he could find into it. Well, the only way Tony was going to find anything out was by asking.</p>\n<p>\u2018How long have you been here?\u2019</p>\n<p>The guy glanced up. \u2018What year is it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u20182016.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018About 20 years.\u2019</p>\n<p>20 years? That meant he\u2019d missed a hell of a lot. Whatever was going on with him \u2013 probably some sort of a healing factor \u2013 may have even slowed down his ageing. After all, Barnes had recognised him. The name he\u2019d used had seemed to familiar to...oh, crap. \u2018What do I call you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018My name\u2019s Logan.\u2019 He lit a flint of some kind and threw it into the underside of the shield. A fire roared to life and Logan pushed it over to Tony. The heat was good. It\u2019d keep him from getting frostbite and losing his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u2018So why did Barnes call you \u201cLucky James\u201d?\u2019 Tony asked.</p>\n<p>Logan\u2019s lips quirked in amusement. \u2018I first met Cap and his babysitter back in the War.\u2019 No need to ask which one. Still, Tony would have snorted if he had the energy. Barnes was Cap\u2019s <em>babysitter</em>? \u2018Back then, I was going by James Howlett. They didn\u2019t notice my healing factor and reckoned I just never got hit.\u2019</p>\n<p>So they called him Lucky James.</p>\n<p>Logan suddenly turned his head, his nostrils flaring. \u2018Someone else is here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019 He turned and strode out. Tony cocked an eyebrow. His first thought had been that Logan had been enhanced by HYDRA experiments. There was too much though. Healing factor, superhuman strength and speed, retractable metal claws between his knuckles, and now enhanced senses. On top of that, they apparently couldn\u2019t brainwash him.</p>\n<p>Was it possible for someone to be <em>born</em> with powers?</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa had secured Zemo and was heading down to find Rogers and Barnes. He had a debt to repay after hunting down the wrong man for so long. When he came to the entrance of the bunker, however, he was shocked to see an unfamiliar man step out. The man was not very tall, likely the result of stunted growth, he wore scrubs of some description, and had facial hair that travelled down his jaw and stopped as it reached his chin.</p>\n<p>Startled, T\u2019Challa flicked his claws out. The man did the same, but his claws were wholly organic, as they seemed to be a part of his body despite the metal encasing them. They were also much longer and likely usually sat in his forearms. It startled T\u2019Challa to be honest. He didn\u2019t let it show on his face.</p>\n<p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 the man asked in English.</p>\n<p>\u2018I am King T\u2019Challa of Wakanda,\u2019 T\u2019Challa stated. \u2018Also known as the Black Panther.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, you\u2019re a long way from home,\u2019 the man remarked.</p>\n<p>\u2018And who might you be?\u2019 T\u2019Challa demanded.</p>\n<p>\u2018The Wolverine.\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa had never heard of a wolverine; he didn\u2019t know what one was. All the same, he decided that enough blood had been shed. He retracted his claws. He watched the Wolverine do the same. However, the suspicion never left the other man\u2019s eyes. Likely he\u2019d been a prisoner here that Stark, Rogers, and Barnes had liberated.</p>\n<p>\u2018I will ask you to stand aside.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Why?\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa hesitated, wondering how much he could say. Then he decided it couldn\u2019t hurt. \u2018I had believed Srgt. Barnes killed my father. I dicovered it wasn\u2019t true, but I had been hunting him all this time. I need to rectify the situation.\u2019</p>\n<p>The Wolverine cocked an eyebrow. \u2018Isn\u2019t that funny? Stark just found out that Barnes <em>did</em> kill his parents.\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa was surprised by that. \u2018I was under they impression they died as a result of a vehicular collision.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So did everyone else, but apparently HYDRA recorded the hit and Stark just had to watch that.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It may have been faked,\u2019 T\u2019Challa pointed out. \u2018The evidence incriminating Barnes for my father\u2019s death was.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Barnes admitted he did it.\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa was stunned speechless for a moment. When he\u2019d been chasing Barnes, he had denied his involvement. He turned out to be innocent. Now he admitted to an assassination. So he must have been guilty. T\u2019Challa quickly recovered himself. \u2018Surely, the fact that he was brainwashed must count for something.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Did it matter to you when you thought he killed your father?\u2019</p>\n<p>Well...no. No, it hadn\u2019t. \u2018I was rash, but I have the true culprit. I still owe Barnes a debt for my sins against him.\u2019</p>\n<p>The Wolverine shrugged. \u2018It was stupid suspecting him anyway. I\u2019ve heard of the Winter Soldier. He moves like a ghost. No one catches him, and suddenly he gets caught on tape? I don\u2019t think so. How exactly did you plan to repay this debt?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I intended to take him back to Wakanda and offer him sanctuary until his programming could be removed.\u2019</p>\n<p>Something on the Wolverine\u2019s face gave T\u2019Challa the distinct impression he\u2019d said something wrong.</p>\n<p>\u2018How long ago did you come out of isolation?\u2019</p>\n<p>Surprised by the random question, T\u2019Challa found himself stammering out an answer. \u2018A few months...\u2019</p>\n<p>The Wolverine nodded. \u2018So you got no idea that offering a wanted killer sanctuary, mind fucked or not, would incite an international incident that would not end well for Wakanda.\u2019<br>\nT\u2019Challa raised his chin. \u2018We are the most technologically advanced nation in the world.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And you are alone.\u2019 The Wolverine smirked. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter how good your guns and bombs are. The minute you tell the world you don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about all Barnes\u2019s actual victims because it turns out your old man wasn\u2019t one, you make every nation in the world your enemy. For reference, that\u2019s nearly 200 countries against your 1. Doesn\u2019t matter how advanced you are, you\u2019re not coming out on top of that pissing contest.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Tell the world...?\u2019 T\u2019Challa\u2019s head spun. Was did he mean?</p>\n<p>\u201870 years,\u2019 the Wolverine said. \u2018The Winter Soldier has been killing for 70 years, and he has remained unseen. All those people, including the Starks, deserve to have justice delivered. Only Barnes can offer that. Maybe they find him not guilty or guilty under diminished capacity but he can tell them who was killed and who wanted those people dead. For the people he killed and disappeared cause he couldn\u2019t fake an accident or whatever, he can tell where he stashed the bodies.\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa hesitated. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that the outside laws could find Barnes innocent of his crimes because of his mental state. Yet this man, who clearly had an American accent, was saying that such a thing could happen. Still, he had to make amends someway. This was the best way he could think of.</p>\n<p>\u2018I presume you have advisors,\u2019 the Wolverine said. \u2018If I were you, I\u2019d turn the actual killer in, go home, and ask them how you can make amends to Barnes. Guy\u2019s been dealt a bum hand, and Rogers doesn\u2019t help.\u2019 He paused. \u2018So what was the big idea anyway?\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa looked up. \u2018You mean for Zemo? What was his ultimate plan?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019</p>\n<p>T\u2019Challa sighed and explained it. By the time he was finished, he\u2019d nearly made his decision. The Wolverine was right. There were countless others who really had lost their loved ones to the Winter Soldier. They deserved to know about it. And those whose bodies had been disappeared \u2013 he hadn\u2019t thought of that \u2013 deserved to have their remains retrieved and given a proper burial.</p>\n<p>\u2018Let me get this straight,\u2019 the Wolverine said. \u2018This guy blamed the Avengers for his family dying in the Sokovia Disaster last year, he decrypted millions of files to find two specific pieces of information, found Barnes\u2019s old handler, got Barnes\u2019s activation codes, drowned the handler, relied entirely on Rogers being against a document that demanded the enhanced be held responsible for their actions and Stark being for it, bombed the signing hoo-hah of said document and framed Barnes for it, relied on Cap going charging in to stop Barnes from being arrested, relied entirely on Stark pulling them in, killed and impersonated a head shrink for Barnes to turn him into the Winter Soldier, was actually left alone with a prisoner considered highly dangerous, knocked out the power in Stark\u2019s facility and sent Barnes on a rampage, relied on Rogers not telling Stark about the other Winter Soldiers and relied on all the Avengers being called in \u2013 even the ones who shouldn\u2019t fucking be there \u2013 and relied on everyone but Stark, Rogers, and Barnes being knocked out of the fight or arrested, which included relying on the Black Widow to betray Stark, relying on no one calling the Russians on him, and relying on all three following him to an abandoned HYDRA bunker in Siberia.\u2019</p>\n<p>TChalla paused.</p>\n<p>\u2018Then, to tie it all up, relying on Rogers to have not told Stark that the Winter Soldier killed his folks.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018How did that plan work?\u2019</p>\n<p>When FRIDAY lost contact with Tony, she had contacted his \u201cTop 5\u201d list: Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Vision, and Bruce. Hopefully, Bruce still had his phone and got the message. Pepper had instantly made a million phone calls. (That may have been an exaggeration but it felt like a million.)</p>\n<p>The UN operator had told her, when she called and reported it, that Tony had sought permission to enter Russian and Siberian airspace and recieved it. He had gaven his reasons as: Barnes and Rogers have already entered and plan to engage five more Winter Soldiers. The local military was already en route to help deal with the threat.</p>\n<p>Vision had recieved permission to enter the airspace in order to assist and retrieve Tony. The \u201cassuming he\u2019s still alive\u201d went unspoken. The military were obviously more concerned for Iron Man, who had respected their laws and borders, than they were for Captain America and the Winter Soldier who had just zoomed in like they owned the place.<br>Rhodey had called her only a couple of hours later, having woken up from surgery to that message on his phone. He had sounded as frustrated as Pepper felt. Tony was out there somewhere, needing help, and they couldn\u2019t get to him. Pepper, at least, could work and distract herself. Rhodey was stuck in a hospital bed.</p>\n<p>Then King T\u2019Challa had arrived to turn in Helmut Zemo, the man truly responsible for the bombing of the Vienna signing. He\u2019d told them what had happened in Siberia. The Russians and Serbs weren\u2019t happy that he\u2019d violated their borders, but he had diplomatic immunity. Pepper could breathe easy, though, knowing that someone was there <em>with</em> Tony. T\u2019Challa then headed back to Wakanda.</p>\n<p>Vision called in scarecely an hour later, informing them that while severely injured, Tony was alive and in surgery in the nearest UN-sanctioned hospital, having his chest (why was it always his chest?) reconstructed. Rogers and Barnes were in custody. The guy with him, it turned out, had focused on keeping Tony warm and had incapacited the two super-soldiers.</p>\n<p>Barnes had lost his metal arm \u2013 from the suit\u2019s unibeam, Vision theorised \u2013 and had a femoral artery psudo-aneurysm. Pepper had little knowledge of medicine so she\u2019d asked. Vision had explained that, generally, when that particular artery was cut \u2013 located on the inner thigh \u2013 the victim would bleed to death. The man who had done it, same one who had protected Tony, had explained that super-healing would stop that from happening. It\u2019d just keep Barnes on the floor for a day or so.</p>\n<p>Rogers had been stabbed through the gut and his jaw had been broken. According to Logan \u2013 that was the guy\u2019s name \u2013 \u201che wouldn\u2019t shut up\u201d. After what Pepper had learned (Vision had turned <em>the</em> video tape over to the UN along with Barnes and Rogers) she felt an uncharacteristic urge to go and break some of Rogers\u2019 bones herself. Tony had, for 25 years, been under the impression that his parents had died in a car accident caused by his father\u2019s drunkardness.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018You know, Peggy Carter told him that.\u2019 Rhodey had pointed at the screen, eyes flat black. \u2018If she was Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. at that point like they say, there\u2019s no way she could have really believed that.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>Pepper was inclined to agree. Howard had been bashed in the face, centring around his nose, until he died. Barnes had then rested his forehead against the steering wheel. All the newspaper and post-mortem pictures of Howard showed him with his <em>forehead</em> against the steering wheel. The wounds would have been in the <em>centre</em> of his face. Maria had been flat-out strangled. She would have had blue around her lips and bruising around her throat.</p>\n<p>A lot of people had clearly fallen down that night \u2013 or perhaps not.</p>\n<p>Nethertheless, Tony had been forced to watch that with the killer a few feet away from him. Pepper\u2019s parents had died of natural causes. She\u2019d been with both of them when they passed on \u2013 the latter of which Tony had given her nearly a full month of paid berevement leave for. She couldn\u2019t even imagine what Tony had gone through.</p>\n<p>The icing on the cake was the footage of what happened <em>after</em> Tony had seen the video. Apparently Zemo had covered all of his bases. Tony had reacted to the situation in the same way any human being would have. Rogers had then escalated the situation by belting him. They beat him nearly to death before Logan showed up and kicked both of them to the curb. The look on Logan\u2019s face while Rogers was trying to justify his inexcusable behaviour was like a balm to an open wound.</p>\n<p>Logan didn\u2019t care what he had to say; just what he\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>Pepper was curious though.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m a mutant,\u2019 Logan said.</p>\n<p>Vision raised his nonexistent eyebrows. \u2018I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t quite understand your meaning.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I have a particular mutation on my 23rd chromosome. It gave me these powers. For every mutant the powers are different. They generally manifest during an emotional outburst in puberty.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s why you want a copy of the Accords?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If they\u2019ve finally gotten around to making laws for super-powered folks, I\u2019d like to see what they are.\u2019 Logan shrugged. \u2018Besides, I\u2019m a Canadian that spends most of my time on American soil. I\u2019d say they apply to me. I don\u2019t like being ignorant. You end up looking like an idiot.\u2019</p>\n<p>Vision nodded. \u2018I\u2019ll put in a request, Mr. Howlett.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Just call me Logan,\u2019 he said.</p>\n<p>***<br>Rhodey was beyond relieved when Tony finally walked through the door. Vision and that Logan guy came with. Most of the time, while Tony was building the braces, Logan had his nose in the Accords. He had a red pen and would often mark things out. Rhodey had passed him a few times. Odd thing was, Logan was rough-talking and often dropped consanats from the ends of some words, but his handwriting was a neat calligraphy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2018Logan said he was around 160 years old,\u2019 Tony had said when Rhodey remarked upon it. \u2018You know, back when you were graded on your handwriting too.\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p>160 years? And yet he\u2019d flick out an iphone and look something up if he didn\u2019t understand it \u2013 unlike a certain Capsicle he could mention. Once, while they were testing out the prototype braces, Tony had showed him something. \u2018Look what my girl FRIDAY found, platypus!\u2019 Tony had then flicked the screens up and Rhodey had stared in astonishment.<br>They were military files, spanning from the Civil War to the Vietnam War. There was a new military profile for each new war. He was generally registered under the name \u201cJames Howlett\u201d and never rose higher in rank than lieutenant, but when they started incorporating pictures it was clear to see he was the same guy.</p>\n<p>\u2018Did he miss any?\u2019 Rhodey asked, amazed.</p>\n<p>\u2018Nope,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Civil to Vietnam, he was in every single one of them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rhodey looked at Tony. \u2018You realise that makes him the most prolific soldier in North American history?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony\u2019s jaw was tense though.</p>\n<p>\u2018But...?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, turns out in Vietnam, one particular colonel noticed the healing factor and decided to weaponise him. They lied to dad about what they were doing with his facility and ended up bonding adamantium to Logan\u2019s bones before dad found out.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rhodey frowned. \u2018What\u2019s adamantium?\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony cracked a tight grin. \u2018Think of it as man-made vibranium. The main difference is that adamantium weighs a lot more.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And Logan lugs that weight around?\u2019 Rhodey had seen how fast he moved.</p>\n<p>Tony nodded. \u2018Constantly. 105 pounds of it. Hardly a wonder he beat up Cap and Barnes.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So what happened?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Dad liked sending inspectors to factories and facilities without warning whoever was working there. Guess.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018One of them went in and found them experimenting on him?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And immediately reported it to dad. Logan said the first words he heard from dad was \u201cwhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\u2019 Tony forced a chuckle. \u2018He then had them all arrested and uncuffed Logan. Soon as he was free, Logan bolted. Dad got them on violations of human rights. Turned out they liked recording their work and Logan wasn\u2019t anywhere near their only victim.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And nobody questioned why a guy with adamantium bonded to his bones was still alive?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Dad didn\u2019t draw attention to it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018That must\u2019ve been how HYDRA found out about him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019d be my guess.\u2019 Tony sighed. \u2018I don\u2019t think dad knew about the mutant thing though.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And the UN?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Look at this.\u2019</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>This, Logan wasn\u2019t afraid to admit, was weird. Stark was currently talking to the UN about mutants. Logan had gone through the Accords. There was nothing wrong with them, honestly. He didn\u2019t know what the Walking Flag was complaining about. No, that was a lie. He did. The Walking Flag didn\u2019t want people telling him that he was wrong. He didn\u2019t want people telling him that he\u2019d failed, or what he\u2019d percieve as such.</p>\n<p>Rogers need to be the big hero had always baffled Logan.</p>\n<p>Logan turned his head. He could both smell and hear Rhodes as he walked to the room in those new braces. Stark was yet another mystery. He let Logan, a virtual stranger who\u2019d saved his life once, stay in his tower free of charge and gave him money, food, and anything else he needed or asked for and expected nothing in return.</p>\n<p>Logan had been suspicious at first. Then the catching up he did had shown the other people who had lived in this tower \u2013 the Avengers. Tony had done the same for them. They had spat in his face. They degraded him, insulted him, made demands of him, and sat on their asses when not \u201cavenging\u201d all the while complaining he was the lazy, entitled, and egotistical one. They used his money, made a mess of his tower, and of the world in general and Tony always had to clean it up.</p>\n<p>Yet, Tony hadn\u2019t kicked them out on their ears.</p>\n<p>Logan would\u2019ve.</p>\n<p>In fact, Logan wanted to take a swing at that Black Widow. She was the only one not behind bars. The only ones who didn\u2019t treat Tony like he existed for their beck and call were Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, and one other they called Bruce. Rhodey walked over, still getting used to the braces.</p>\n<p>\u2018Hey, Logan, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you something.\u2019 And Rhodey, along with Pepper, Happy, and Tony had been quick to notice his intolerance for small talk.</p>\n<p>\u2018Shoot.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If you\u2019ve been a soldier since the Civil War, how come you\u2019ve never ranked higher than lieutenant?\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan chuckled. It was a reasonable question, especially coming from another soldier. \u2018I know what I can and can\u2019t do. I can shoot, I can fight, and I can kill. I can see an ambush ahead and I can react to it. I can protect civilians from bullets and bombs. But I can\u2019t lead men into battle worth a damn. I don\u2019t connect with people and I terrify them. I\u2019m a soldier, not a commander.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Lt. Howlett thinks he can find the Black Widow and capture her,\u2019 Tony told the UN panel. It was better, in these settings, to use Logan\u2019s military title. \u2018We\u2019re asking permission for him to try.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Are you certain he can successfully fight a highly trained assassin?\u2019 the Romanian respresentative asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Seems, between wars, he travelled an awful lot. He\u2019s not only fluent in several languages but he\u2019s also proficient in several forms of martial arts, which removes the one advantage Romanoff would have had over him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018His healing factor is certainly an advantage,\u2019 the Chinese representative said. \u2018You\u2019re certain it can defend againsts poisons and narcotics?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We tested it,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018Any foreign substances that come into his body, or even into contact with his blood, are instantly attacked by his antibodies and neutralised. The healing factor is why HYDRA\u2019s Winter Soldier experiments were ineffective on him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We will discuss the issue,\u2019 the New Zealand representative said.</p>\n<p>***<br>\n<strong>Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong></p>\n<p>All it took was a single sniff.</p>\n<p>Romanoff\u2019s room in Stark Tower hadn\u2019t been touched since she\u2019d left. Her scent was drenched through the room. Then she was easy to track. She had moved herself into a heavily populated area, where she would be more difficult to pick out in a crowd. She had also dyed her hair blonde, merging her in further than her less-common red hair would do.</p>\n<p>Logan smirked as he toyed with his beer bottle cap. One might wonder why a guy like him would want to do this. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have a stake in it, but he often didn\u2019t involve himself in things he wasn\u2019t getting paid for. Part of him pitied Stark, sure. Another part of him couldn\u2019t believe Romanoff\u2019s gall (a former Russian spy dumped the databanks of an entire intelligence agency on the internet and then gave the American senate a massive F-U) and he wanted to see her knocked off her pedastal.</p>\n<p>The third thing was that, over the years, he had seen countless minorities struggle out of the so-called shackles that society placed on them. He knew it was not an easy road. If mutants wanted to do the same thing, they had to follow suit. They had to disprove the prejudice against them, just like Martin Luther King had disproved that his minority were \u201cof limited intellect\u201d.</p>\n<p>If this shit was ever going to stop, and the Accords were the logical first step, they had to prove they were not sub-human like so many thought they were. The situation had become so dire that someone, Logan wasn\u2019t sure who, had intentionally limited knowledge of mutants. That was why Stark, his buddies, and the UN had never heard of mutants. Stepping out now was a risk. Logan was aware of that and he had considered it.</p>\n<p>Logan lit a cigar. The little spider slipped out of the diner and Logan pulled his feet down from the table.</p>\n<p>Time to play Predator and Prey.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Natasha had noticed her shadow.</p>\n<p>At first, she tried to shake him off. He was just as dexterous she she was, however, and easily kept up with her. And it was a he. A male who didn\u2019t appear to be overly tall. In fact, he seemed to be below average height. He was also wearing a large jacket, but his shoulders appeared wide enough for him to have a good set of muscles on him.</p>\n<p>Realising that she wasn\u2019t going to shake him, Natasha led him into a secluded area. If she had to fight him, she didn\u2019t want any witnesses. In the past, she\u2019d had S.H.I.E.L.D. or Tony to shelter her when she needed to lie low. But she\u2019d burnt those bridges now. She probably should have thought that through a bit more.</p>\n<p>Tony had been useful, even if he did push her tolerance to its limits.</p>\n<p>Natasha stopped and turned. The man stepped into the alleyway. Natasha got her first good look at him. He looked somewhere in his 30s. A cigar was lightly clenched between his teeth. He looked ferocious, in a way that people did to themselves. He wanted to scare people away. A slow smirk spread across his face, and then he spoke in an accent local to the Canadian Northwestern Territories.</p>\n<p>\u2018I was wondering when you were going to stop.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Natasha affected a Slovenian accent.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, that\u2019s good,\u2019 he said. \u2018But save it, darlin\u2019. I know who you are, Natasha Romanoff.\u2019</p>\n<p>Natasha ground her teeth.</p>\n<p>The guy smirked. \u2018As for what I want, some beer,\u2019 he tapped the cigar in his mouth, \u2018and a few more stoogies would be nice.\u2019</p>\n<p>He was being a smart-arse. Natasha ground her teeth. \u2018How did you find me?\u2019 She must have gotten careless somewhere, or been betrayed.</p>\n<p>The man just smirked and tapped his nose.</p>\n<p>The time for talk was over. Natasha attacked. The man stood there, waiting, smirking like every stupid man who thought they could take on the Black Widow. Her punch, aimed right for his nose, was knocked aside by his wrist in a smooth manoeuvre. The bones of his wrist seemed to be far more solid than most men. He was most likely used to strong-arming his way around.</p>\n<p>Natasha shifted, about to kick his legs out from under him, but he moved too. He stepped back with one leg and punched her in the shoulder. Natasha felt herself propelled through the air, spinning as her body was caught up in the momentum of the hit and she was forced to compensate. She recovered and made a perfect landing.</p>\n<p>That was a good enough hit that he\u2019d be trained. Natasha rolled her shoulder as she stood up. She was almost out of her Bites so she\u2019d avoid using those if she could. She flicked out her guns and shot before the man could react, aiming for the chest and the head. She hated to hurt anyone, but what could you expect going up against the Black Widow.</p>\n<p>The man chuckled as his head snapped back. He didn\u2019t stagger though, not like she was expecting. He lowered his head again and she saw why. The wounds she\u2019d inflicted on his face, which were quickly closing over, glinted as if there was metal inside. <em>Implants?</em> How many did he have? It looked like she\u2019d hit nothing but the implants.</p>\n<p>Bites it was then. Natasha flicked her guns back away and fired a Bite at him. The man flinched back as it hit his shoulder. He then paused and looked at it. That wasn\u2019t right! He should\u2019ve been on the ground now. He picked it off his shoulder and looked at it. Natasha\u2019s gut dropped. Just what was this guy?</p>\n<p>She was <em>not</em> afraid.</p>\n<p>\u2018Stark\u2019s tech, I guess,\u2019 he said. \u2018Funny how you run him down at every turn but you're quite happy to use all his toys.\u2019</p>\n<p>Natasha narrowed her eyes. \u2018Tony sent you.\u2019 Of course that arrogant bastard had to have the last word. He would find someone like this and send him hunting Natasha. It was his revenge for that \u201cego\u201d comment she\u2019d made at the hospital \u2013 not that it wasn\u2019t true.</p>\n<p>\u2018No, the UN sent me. But I did ask. Gotta say, you\u2019re not as good as the other Black Widows I\u2019ve fought over the years. One of them even knocked me over.\u2019</p>\n<p>She <em>wasn\u2019t</em> afraid.</p>\n<p>Natasha ground her teeth. She charged again, leaping into the air and going in for a scissor kick to his head. It would distract him before it hit and she would be able to get out of here. As she came in, though, hot white pain shot through her left thigh. The next thing she knew, she was on the ground. </p>\n<p>Natasha tried to get up but her leg hurt too much. It wouldn\u2019t move. Looking down to the leg, she saw a pool of blood around it. Natasha looked up. The man looked down at her, the picture of a child\u2019s nightmare. Natasha watched as three razor-sharp metal claws retracted into his hand. He lifted his eyes and she twisted her head again.</p>\n<p>Armed and uniformed men moved into the alleyway. They had \u201cSEP\u201d stamped on their uniforms. <em>The Red Panthers.</em> They pointed their guns at her as they advanced. The man took the cigar out of his mouth and then spoke in unaccented Slovene. \u2018<em>You might want to get a doctor to her leg. I didn\u2019t hit the femoral artery, but I hit enough to immobilise her.</em>\u2019</p>\n<p>Who was this guy?</p>\n<p>One of the men, likely the ranking officer, nodded. \u2018<em>Thank you, Lt. Howlett. Mr. Stark has asked that you be informed he\u2019s waiting for you with a jet.</em>\u2019</p>\n<p>Lt. Howlett, obviously a foot soldier of some kind, winced and walked away.</p>\n<p>***<br>\nThe Rogue Avengers, as the media had dubbed them, were finally all in prison.</p>\n<p>Logan\u2019s part in it, and the positive consequences of such, had been quietly released in the direction of a particular audience. Tony was right. It was important to let other mutants know that they were no longer non-entities to the United Nations; that things could get better if they stepped up and helped.</p>\n<p>Pepper was busy organising Legal and checking the lawsuits against each Rogue Avenger. Finally satisfied, she had headed back to her office to close up affairs for the day. Her PA was on the phone as she walked past. \u2018Hold on, sir, she\u2019s just come in.\u2019 Cathy lowered the phone. \u2018Miss Potts, there\u2019s a Professor Charles Xavier on the telephone for you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Thank you, Cathy. I\u2019ll take it in my office.\u2019 As Pepper walked through into her office, she thought about the name. It sounded familiar. By the time she sat down, she remembered where she\u2019d heard the name before and she smiled to herself.</p>\n<p>For the past few weeks, ever since Logan had caught Romanoff, Tony had observed several mutants eyeing Stark Industries buildings \u2013 specifically the New York one where Tony himself was known to work. As of yet, none of them had the nerve to knock on the door, so to speak, and ask to see the Accords. Maybe they weren\u2019t sure of approaching a figure such as Tony Stark, maybe they were unsure of the conditions. Some may have even, quite reasonably, suspected it to be a trap.</p>\n<p>This was the first contact. Pepper answered the phone. \u2018Hello, Viriginia Potts speaking. How may I help you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Miss Potts,\u2019 a British accent on the other end of the line said. \u2018My name is Professor Charles Xavier. I apologise, but I was unsure how else to contact Mr. Stark.\u2019<br>\n\u2018That\u2019s quite all right,\u2019 Pepper said. \u2018I presume that you want a look at the Sokovia Accords.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Indeed. May I ask how you knew the nature of my call?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Your school came to Mr. Stark\u2019s notice shortly after the Battle of New York. I believe a number of your people arrived as volunteers to help with the clean-up.\u2019 She smiled to herself. \u2018It was the X-shaped insignia they were all wearing that aroused Mr. Stark\u2019s curiosity.\u2019</p>\n<p>From the sigh on the other end of the line, Pepper could just about see the poor man lift a hand to his face.</p>\n<p>Pepper held back her chuckle. When Tony had found the source of the insignia, he\u2019d then zeroed in on the amount of dispossessed children that were taken in by the school. He\u2019d even been suspicious when he saw Xavier\u2019s taskforce, the X-Men operating on the down-low. It was only when he met Logan and became aware of the existence of mutants that he\u2019d worked out there was nothing nerfarious going on there. Xavier was simply offering sanctuary and education to all of the underage mutants he could find and then some of them joined the X-Men when they grew up.</p>\n<p>The Brotherhood was a far greater concern.</p>\n<p>\u2018I was wondering, Miss Potts, if I could arrange an appointment with Mr. Stark.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Of course.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Westchester, NY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s lips were pressed into a thin line. \u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Scott, I have told you,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018I\u2019ve already scanned Tony Stark. He is playing this straight. If we want to be accepted into society, we need to show society that we are willing to work with them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Remy LeBeau nodded beside him. \u2018And I\u2019ve met Logan. If the Accords were a load of crock, he would\u2019ve given them a great big F-U and walked out \u2013 not signed them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Hank smiled to himself. \u2018Added onto that, the amount of anti-mutant attacks since the event has dropped by 12%. The best way to drop it lower is to show the world more enhanced beings willing to work within the confines of the law. We need to show them that we are reasonable individuals; that the Rogue Avengers are the exception rather than the rule.\u2019</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Scott nodded.</p>\n<p>\u2018What about the other mutants?\u2019 Storm asked. \u2018You said they were loitering around.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018They are unsure about precisely how safe this is,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018Many want to be pulled under the protection of some kind of law, but just as many are fearful of a set-up. They are waiting for somebody else to walk in and prove to them that the Accords are not the metaphorical cheese on the mousetrap.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Manhattan, New York City</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018Boss, your guests have arrived.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Thank you, FRIDAY.\u2019 Tony picked up a copy of the Accords and walked into the lift. As FRIDAY moved it, he asked. \u2018Who have we got?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Professor Charles Xavier and Dr. Hank McCoy,\u2019 FRIDAY said.</p>\n<p>Tony nodded and stepped out of the lift. He walked down the hall and into the conference room FRIDAY had shown them to. Tony stepped in and he was mildly surprised. Professor Xavier, whom he\u2019d seen a lot when he was investigating the school, was talking to a large man covered in blue fur, but dressed in an impeccable three-piece suit.<br>Logan had mentioned that occasionally mutants were born with vivid blue skin, but he\u2019d never mentioned having a coat of fur in the colour.</p>\n<p>Huh. Must\u2019ve been part of his mutation.</p>\n<p>\u2018Good morning, gentlemen,\u2019 Tony said, ever the businessman. \u2018Sorry to keep you waiting.\u2019</p>\n<p>Dr. McCoy stood up. \u2018Not at all, Dr. Stark. Thank you for making the time for us.\u2019 Well, for looking like a blue furry monster, he sure did behave like a civilised man. Of course, Tony would be the last person to disparage someone\u2019s appearance. He still had some theories on the Hulk to be honest.</p>\n<p>\u2018Not at all.\u2019 Tony shook both their hands and sat down opposite them. \u2018Now, you\u2019ve looked through the copies of the Accords I gave you and made your own amendments?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We have,\u2019 Professor Xavier said. \u2018I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of issues we had with the Accords. I had thought there would be far more restrictive clauses in there.\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony cracked a grin. \u2018Yes. Logan already went through them and pointed out everything that he thought would be problematic to the mutant community.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And that\u2019s exactly what Remy LeBeau theorised.\u2019 Dr. McCoy smiled to himself and flicked open the document in front of him. \u2018He seems to have only missed out on issues a politically-minded individual would notice.\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony suppressed a chuckle. He still remembered what Logan had said when Tony had pointed out he\u2019d stuck to practical problems over anything else. <em>\u2018I ain\u2019t a diplomat and I ain\u2019t gonna try to be one.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>Hank McCoy was the diplomat.</p>\n<p>Professor Xavier smiled. From his power-set, Tony presumed he knew what had been plaguing Tony\u2019s head since he\u2019d learned the scope of Mutantkind. Logan hadn\u2019t known the answer. He had, in fact, been as confused as Tony on the matter. A telepath, though, might have a better idea of what was going on.</p>\n<p>\u2018I can hear you wondering about it, Tony,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018You can ask.\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony cracked a smile, but asked. \u2018Given the nature of your powers, and the common way in which these powers manifest, how have mutants remained undetected to this day? Especially considering how your bunch have been pushing for peaceful human and mutant co-existence.\u2019</p>\n<p>The Professor and Dr. McCoy looked at each other and smiled tightly.</p>\n<p>\u2018There is a sub-branch of mutants,\u2019 Dr. McCoy explained. \u2018It is their belief that mutants as a whole would be safer if baseline humans are ignorant of our existence. They believe our right to the protection of the law are a fair price to pay for that safety.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018They go to extreme lengths to ensure baseline humans such as yourself never discover that we exist,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018They often use their powers to ensure such things and they have made our negotiations most difficult.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Right.\u2019 Tony tapped the tabletop and a holographic screen appeared in front of him. \u2018If you tell me what power-sets I\u2019m looking at, I should be able to set up some counteractants for them.\u2019</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Xavier had made a request before they left. \u2018I would like to meet Logan.\u2019</p>\n<p>So Tony had FRIDAY let Logan know they were coming and led the Professor and Hank into the lift. FRIDAY moved them up to the suite he\u2019d given Logan when he first came to the Tower. Unlike the Rogue Avengers, for some weird reason, Logan had been genuinely surprised at the level of hospitality.</p>\n<p>Logan had been surprised at the free room and board; had expected to have to pay for it. As he\u2019d said, it\u2019d cost a small fortune to run, so it should cost an arm and a leg to rent. He\u2019d then been surprised that he was given anything he asked for, completely free of charge. He still wanted to find another place before he got too comfortable with it.</p>\n<p>Charles smiled to himself. He might have to talk to Tony about mental shields. The man was just projecting his thoughts outward like it was nothing. And, more concerning, there was a trace of forceful mental manipulation that Charles could pick up. It wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that would result from emotional manipulation, but rather from the hand of a telepath \u2013 and it was palpably malignant.</p>\n<p>He would speak to the man on the matter later, when there was not an audience. Perhaps he could help him. It did, rather, make Xavier want to have a word with those people. That was not even mentioning what they had cost his home, and his children, with their callous and self-serving actions.</p>\n<p>The lift opened and Tony led them out into the suite. Logan, as Charles had been told, was not a particularly large man. He turned his head as they walked in. One eyebrow was lifted. What was curious was the lack of activity he seemed engaged in when they entered. He wasn\u2019t watching TV, he wasn\u2019t reading, he wasn\u2019t playing any sort of video game. He was just sitting on the couch, smoking a cigar and with a beer in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u2018Afternoon.\u2019 Tony strolled over and plopped down next to him. \u2018I expect FRIDAY told you the Professor and Hank want a word with you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah.\u2019 Logan looked at them. \u2018What about?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I have a few questions,\u2019 the Professor said, wheeling over to a more respectable distance for conversation. \u2018My first question is this: I\u2019d like to know your reasons for supporting the Accords.\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan tapped his cigar in the ashtray on the coffee table in front of him. \u2018My powers manifested when I was thirteen and I had to leave home. I know what happens out there. The UN were the first ones to define human rights as they stand now. I know the Accords were drafted as a response to the Walking Flag and his pack of mutts stomping all over the world like they owned it. Stark, at least, had regard for Sovereign borders, which was why they only talked to him.\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony chuckled to himself.</p>\n<p>Logan cracked a smirk. \u2018The Accords are the UN admitting that non-baselines are human and should have rights. Course, that\u2019s just my translation. If I wanted to push that idea, I had to prove that I was willing to work within their system.\u2019</p>\n<p>Charles would admit, if only to himself, that he was amused by Logan\u2019s summary of Captain America and his followers.</p>\n<p>\u2018I fail to understand why Steve Rogers behaved in the way he did,\u2019 Hank said.</p>\n<p>\u2018Because he\u2019s a self-righteous little shit,\u2019 Logan stated.</p>\n<p>Hank frowned. \u2018Is the explanation really so simplistic?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Rogers is a simplistic guy,\u2019 Logan told him. \u2018For him, life is simple. There\u2019s good and bad, and he\u2019s got the strangest need to be the hero of the story. So anyone who argues with him or disagrees with him any other way must be a bad person, and anyone who follows him like a dog is a good person.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Hold on.\u2019 Tony frowned. \u2018Are you saying the whole reason Rogers treated me like I was morally bankrupt was because I didn\u2019t agree with every word he said.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, that and two other reasons,\u2019 Logan said. \u2018Firstly, Rogers does not like to be confused, so he does not like people to use big words. Lazy ass doesn\u2019t know how to put the words in context and he doesn\u2019t try. So he glares at whoever\u2019s talking in the hopes that they\u2019ll dumb it down for him. The next reason is you were already Iron Man.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He considered that competition?\u2019 Charles guessed. Logan\u2019s mind was unusually hard to read. It might have been the adamantium on his skeleton. After all, Magneto had a metal helmet that kept Charles out.</p>\n<p>\u2018Like I said, he likes to be the big hero.\u2019 Logan shrugged. \u2018He hated anyone else doing the rescuing. Back in the War, I met him because my unit was teamed up with him and his Howling Commandos. We were supposed to rescue a group of civilians. I reckon there was someone important in the group of hostages.\u2019</p>\n<p>Charles was about to ask what he meant, but he picked up Tony\u2019s thoughts. It was apparently very unusual for soldiers to be tasked with rescuing civilians. The soldiers were often seen to be better suited on the front line. Tony knew the only reason his friend, Col. Rhodes, had been allowed to search for him for so long in 2008 was because of who he was, not that he was a civilian in enemy hands. He was <em>Tony Stark</em>, so he was important enough to rescue.</p>\n<p>\u2018While Rogers and his bunch punched the Nazis, my CO sent me and a bunch of others to rescue the hostages and move them to a safe location.\u2019 Logan smirked bitterly. </p>\n<p>\u2018Afterwards, Rogers acted like we\u2019d sworn in church or something. I guess that\u2019s not as relevant a phrase as it was back then, but you get the point. He just didn\u2019t like somebody else considered the hero.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So he felt threatened by Iron Man?\u2019 Tony asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, you were the only other one people considered a hero. It would have definitely rubbed him the wrong way.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And Barnes?\u2019 Hank asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Rogers is stuck in the past. He still thinks in terms of guilty until proven innocent, the League of Nations, and the Death Penalty. He thinks any trial would be a farce that would end with Barnes stood up and shot.\u2019</p>\n<p>Charles frowned. \u2018I should like to correct that.\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan didn\u2019t like to fly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d managed to shake off every piece of cultural conditioning from his early life, except that. Instead of focusing on the fact that he was in the air, he focused on the coming shitstorm. It wasn\u2019t a surprise that Maximoff had been in Tony\u2019s head and turned the guy\u2019s guilt complex up to 11. No, Logan hadn\u2019t been surprised when the Professor asked to see Tony alone and then, underestimating Logan\u2019s hearing, told him that his mind had been tampered with. He hadn\u2019t been surprised when, upon Tony agreeing to let the man check, the telepath had found the genius\u2019s frontolimbic network being constantly remotely stimulated \u2013 or, Logan would call it \u201cthe self-blame part of the brain\u201d.</p>\n<p>Maximoff was the only telepath Tony had been in contact with, and she was willing to toss over a dozen cars on top of the guy. She was certainly liable to mind-rape someone. Logan had seen the footage. Those jokers should not have been let out of the house by themselves. Sure the Raft hadn\u2019t been ideal, but Thaddeus Ross had only been able to keep them there a week before the UN asked where they were and discovered his illegal incarceration facility.</p>\n<p>He was currently in prison awaiting trial.</p>\n<p>The jet came to a landing and Logan stood up. There had been a few other mutants who wanted to come, including some slim they called Cyclops. But Tony had said he and Rogers would just rile each other up. Logan was inclined to agree and, thankfully, so was the Professor. Instead, along with him, the Professor, and Hank, a nicely level-headed woman called Storm came along. She told him she\u2019d been a teenaged thief before the Professor found her.</p>\n<p>Of course, that made sense.</p>\n<p>Most mutants spent some time as teenaged thieves.</p>\n<p>The guards let them in and they were taken to a cell block. Logan almost smirked. Barnes had already been removed from the facility. In fact, he\u2019d never been here in the first place. A review had found that Barnes had been fine before Rogers showed up. The big guns had decided to separate the two of them for safety reasons.</p>\n<p>Not a dumb idea. It was fine when Barnes was in possession of all his faculties and was actually capable of babysitting the Walking Flag. When the Glorified Sales Gimmick was in charge though...well, look what happened in Bucharest. They were far better in these specialised cells that Tony had built years ago.</p>\n<p>Something he was sanctioned to do years ago by someone or other who was concerned about enhanced criminals. It made sense. And these cells were far more humane than the cells of the Raft. At least here they had some level of privacy - and their own adjoining bathrooms each one might add (thought there were ulterior motives attached to those). These were more like normal cells. Logan had never liked being ignorant \u2013 and these idiots were walking examples of why.</p>\n<p>Romanoff\u2019s leg was obviously still healing. As she moved to her feet, on the defensive, her movements were sluggish. Of course, her noticing had the bird-brain notice and then the others jumped to attention. Barton reeked of anger. From what Logan knew of him, he was used to having his ass covered and had now stooped to the blame game.</p>\n<p>The glares from Wilson and Barton were the glares of self-righteous men who thought they had a moral high ground. Maximoff was making an express effort to look pathetic. She was trying to garner sympathy and possibly even assistance from them. Romanoff\u2019s face was blank.</p>\n<p>Rogers himself stood there staring at Logan, as if trying to connect him with a man half-forgotten. That suited him. Rogers had always struck Logan as a \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d type. Logan walked over to his cell, leaned an elbow on the bars. The Walking Flag\u2019s jaw tightened a moment before he opened his mouth.</p>\n<p>Logan interrupted him. \u2018I see your jaw healed. Barnes tell you who I was?\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers scowled. \u2018He said who he thought you were, but that\u2019s impossible. Lucky James was a soldier in the Second World War. You can\u2019t possibly be him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Luck had nothing to do with it, bub.\u2019 Logan lifted his fist. <em>SNIKT!</em> He was satisfied to see Rogers flinch back as he popped his claws. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Romanoff\u2019s eyes widen slightly as she must\u2019ve only just worked out what he\u2019d stabbed her with. \u2018I got a healing factor.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018How...?\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan retracted his claws. \u2018That we ain\u2019t here to talk about.\u2019 He walked away from the cell. \u2018We\u2019re here to talk about your recent bout of bullshit.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Hey, remember who you\u2019re talking to!\u2019 Wilson snapped.</p>\n<p>Logan smirked at him. \u2018And who\u2019s that, mutt? Captain America.\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018I\u2019m Canadian.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So what?\u2019 Clint demanded. \u2018Wanda\u2019s Sokovian and she still respects that he\u2019s a hero.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No, she doesn\u2019t.\u2019 The Professor wheeled forward. He then injected his mental voice into all of their heads. <em>Miss Maximoff views you all as a convenient way to escape the consequences of her frankly detestable actions.</em></p>\n<p>Logan wasn\u2019t sure how invasive it was to put your thoughts into someone else\u2019s head, but it got the Professor\u2019s point across. That, and it was entirely amusing to watch all of them nearly jump out of their skin. Maximoff even abandoned her act in favour of looking shocked and outraged. Outraged? Really? Why the hell should she feel the need to be outraged?</p>\n<p>\n<em>She can\u2019t inject her thoughts into someone else\u2019s mind, Logan. She likes to believe she is the most powerful psionic enhanced person in the world. She now feels threatened. Much like a small child\u2019s reaction when they see another child has a toy that they perceive to be better than their own.</em>\n</p>\n<p>That one would\u2019ve gone only to Logan.</p>\n<p>The next one was directed at everyone again. <em>When I was a boy, I discovered that I could hear the thoughts of others. I could make them think anything I wanted them to think.</em></p>\n<p>Barton interrupted him. \u2018Don\u2019t much like mind powers. Been there done that.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018One.\u2019 If he got to three, Logan was going to teach him the Victorian way of dealing with big-mouthed dumbasses.</p>\n<p>The Professor went on as if neither had spoken. <em>As I grew, though, I became aware that my power was not one to be taken lightly. I could cause extreme damage to a person \u2013 mentally, emotionally, and physically \u2013 if I did not control my use of the power. Mr. Barton, you have expressed your distaste for mind powers. I have encountered one other who said as much, and she spent years under mind control. I presume you have also been subjected to such.</em></p>\n<p>Barton\u2019s haughty look fell away. It was safe to assume he hadn\u2019t spent nearly as long under his mind-control session. Slowly, Barton nodded.</p>\n<p>Having made his point, the Professor switched to vocal communication. \u2018Would it then interest you to know that you are currently under mind control?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Liar!\u2019 Maximoff hissed.</p>\n<p>\u2018You are a sniper, are you not?\u2019 the Professor asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes...\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Then why did you feel guilty for the death of Pietro Maximoff in the Sokovia Disaster?\u2019 The Professor gave him a kind smile. \u2018You must have had partners die before, and you had only just formed an uneasy alliance. Mr. Maximoff died, if my information is correct, saving yourself and a young child from gunfire. How should that incite feelings of guilt within yourself?\u2019</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t. Snipers were desensitised to death. At the very most, in the circumstances, Barton should have felt a bit of regret at the other man\u2019s death \u2013 not full-blown guilt. That was unless Maximoff\u2019s sister had blamed Barton for her brother\u2019s death and, upon finding no guilt in him, constructed it.</p>\n<p>Romanoff slowly turned her head and looked at Maximoff accusingly as the young woman spat out denials. With that collar though \u2013 because, really, how else were baseline guards going to protect themselves against her? \u2013 she couldn\u2019t even try to stop Barton\u2019s common sense from rearing its head.</p>\n<p>Barton slowly turned his head and he backed away to the fartherest corner of his cell from Maximoff.</p>\n<p>\u2018But...\u2019 Rogers sounded like his head was spinning. \u2018No, Clint. The fact that you felt bad for Pietro dying means you\u2019re a good person.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No, Steve, he\u2019s right.\u2019 Romanoff spoke up now. \u2018Clint and I are killers. We kill people, and we don\u2019t feel bad about it. Guilt and remorse for death has been trained out of us. It makes far more sense that Wanda thought Clint should feel bad for her brother\u2019s death and forced the emotion onto him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Natasha, Wanda\u2019s just a kid!\u2019 Rogers insisted.</p>\n<p>The statement made Logan laugh. \u2018A kid?\u2019 He sauntered over to Wanda\u2019s cell and looked down at her. Apparently she\u2019d completely abandoned her previous image as a meek abused little girl. She was just about hissing at him. \u2018Let\u2019s see, we\u2019re fully developed, we look like we want to kill me. Doesn\u2019t look like a kid to me. How old are you, girl?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018None of your business!\u2019 she snapped.</p>\n<p>One of the guards answered for him. \u2018She\u2019s 25, Lt.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201825, huh?\u2019 Logan nodded and walked away from her cell. \u2018You know, I can\u2019t think of a single society that considers 25 a child. Generally, you become at adult at 18. 21 at the oldest.\u2019 He shot the Walking Flag a hard smirk. \u2018If they move from those two numbers, they tend to go down, not up.\u2019 He looked at the other three. \u2018I\u2019m gonna take a guess as to why he\u2019s saying she\u2019s a kid.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, it seems you haven\u2019t been wrong yet,\u2019 the Professor remarked. \u2018Please.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018As I said before, Rogers <em>thinks</em> in the terms of the world in the 40s.\u2019 Logan smirked. \u2018If he can get a HYDRA volunteer like Maximoff onto his version of the Avengers, he thinks he can work Barnes outta trouble.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers drew back, shocked.</p>\n<p>\u2018And you\u2019re right again,\u2019 the Professor surmised.</p>\n<p>\u2018That wouldn\u2019t work,\u2019 Barton said. \u2018Barnes was brainwashed. Maximoff chose to join. I don\u2019t know what the hell you were thinking Steve, but those are two completely different circumstances.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No!\u2019 Steve insisted. \u2018HYDRA manipulated Wanda and her brother into joining. They were victims, just like Bucky!\u2019</p>\n<p>Romanoff gave Logan a sidelong look. It didn\u2019t take much for him to guess she was impressed and annoyed that he\u2019d read Steve\u2019s motives so well when she hadn\u2019t. Of course, Black Widows were trained only to seduce, infiltrate, and kill. People-reading was pretty low on their list of skills. Logan had learned it as a matter of survival.</p>\n<p>\u2018No, Mr. Rogers,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018They knew what they were doing. They chose to join a terrorist organisation not to protect their country, as you believed, but because they wanted to kill Tony Stark. Their reasoning was extremely illogical and your catering to such a thing was even worse.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Wilson asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018What happened,\u2019 the Professor said, \u2018was that an unspecified explosive destroyed their apartment complex, killing the parents and trapping the twins inside. Following that, a bomb with Tony Stark\u2019s name on it landed in the apartment and they decided to blame Tony Stark for the event. It makes sense for a 10 year old to do, but once you reach adulthood the argument falls apart.\u2019</p>\n<p>Yes. Yes, it did.</p>\n<p>\u2018Liar!\u2019 Maximoff hissed. \u2018Stark killed\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Shut up, Wanda!\u2019 Clint snapped. He spoke more levelly to the Professor. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<em>I have no experience with Stark Industries weapons, Logan, the Professor told him. But you do. You tell them.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018Stark\u2019s weapons were the most reliable things you could get,\u2019 Logan said. \u2018I\u2019ve been using the things since they hit the battlefield. I had a choice between weapons created by different companies, I\u2019d go for the Stark ones. They\u2019d work even when all the others would pack it in.\u2019 He fixed Maximoff with a hard enough look to make her shrink back. \u2018That had been a real Stark bomb, girlie, then you\u2019d be dead.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No!\u2019 Maximoff screamed. \u2018It was Stark\u2019s missile! Stark killed my parents!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re wrong,\u2019 Rogers insisted. \u2018Tony\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan interrupted him. \u2018Even Stane sold working weapons. If it didn\u2019t work, it was stripped down and never went into circulation.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Who?\u2019 Rogers looked genuinely confused.</p>\n<p>Logan frowned. He couldn\u2019t possibly have allowed himself to be that ignorant, could he? \u2018Obadiah Stane. What, you never heard of him? The guy that was selling weapons to terrorists behind Tony\u2019s back? And behind his old man\u2019s before him? Are you really so resistant to this century that you won\u2019t look up anything that happened since 1945?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, give him a break!\u2019 Wilson snapped. \u2018I\u2019d like to see you adjust to living out of your time.\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan smirked at him. \u2018Oh, I have, mutt.\u2019</p>\n<p>Wilson drew back. \u2018Huh?\u2019</p>\n<p>Hank spoke up. \u2018Logan was born in 1829. He has adapted to not only social changes in that time, but every invention from then to now. He adapted to indoor plumbing, to the invention of the automobile, the semi-automatic rifle, the invention of the light bulb, of radar, of CCTV, of the <em>internet</em>. It is not that Mr. Rogers\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Captain,\u2019 Rogers interrupted him.</p>\n<p>\u2018It is not that <em>Mr.</em> Rogers,\u2019 Hank just reiterated what he\u2019d said, \u2018is struggling to adapt. It is that he doesn\u2019t want to adapt. Perhaps that is part of why he dislikes Tony Stark so. Mr. Stark is a living, breathing representation of everything that Mr. Rogers wants to ignore.\u2019</p>\n<p>Good theory. Could even be true.</p>\n<p>Romanoff stared at Hank, like she couldn't believe such a monstrous-looking individual was so intelligent.</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s not\u2014\u2019 Rogers started to say.</p>\n<p>Logan wasn\u2019t having that. \u2018Which brings us to the Accords.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers set his jaw. \u2018We\u2019re not signing them.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Bit late for that.\u2019 Logan pulled a cigar out of his top pocket. \u2018You\u2019re being charged for international felonies, among some other shit, so you obviously don\u2019t care about Sovereign borders.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We were saving people.\u2019 Rogers\u2019 tone took on that irritating disapproving edge. It\u2019d always made Logan want to sock him in the jaw.</p>\n<p>\u2018Saving people?\u2019 Storm finally spoke up. \u2018You caused the deaths of 47 people in Nigeria.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018More would have died if we hadn\u2019t been there,\u2019 Rogers stated like it was fact.</p>\n<p>\u2018How do you know that?\u2019 Hank asked calmly.</p>\n<p>Rogers froze. \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You mistook which building Crossbones was targeting,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018Then you chased a baseline human terrorist through a crowded marketplace. This chase was what led to the deaths of those people \u2013 deaths which could have easily been avoided if you had contacted the ATS once you became aware of the issue.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018ATS?\u2019 Rogers asked, clearly confused.</p>\n<p>\u2018Anti-Terrorism Squad,\u2019 Logan said. \u2018The part of the Nigeria police force that deals with counter-terrorism.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers shook his head. \u2018There wasn\u2019t time.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But there was time for you to set up a trap?\u2019 Hank questioned with a raised eyebrow. \u2018I begin to think that Logan is right. Your entire sense of self-validation comes from being the hero all the time.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers looked annoyed and gave Hank the disapproving look.</p>\n<p>Hank, for his part, shot an amused look at Logan. \u2018Despite your appearance, Wolverine, you are incredibly perceptive.\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan chuckled. \u2018You can talk.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Thank you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers shook his head. \u2018We can\u2019t always save everyone,\u2019 he insisted, probably to draw attention back to him, \u2018but we save everyone we can.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Really?\u2019 Storm stepped forward and flicked out an iPad. \u2018What about what happened in Bucharest?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018They were going to kill Bucky!\u2019 Rogers insisted. \u2018He\u2019s innocent!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He was innocent of the Vienna bombing, yes,\u2019 Storm said. \u2018But the orders were actually \u201cshoot on sight, <em>if</em> the target becomes threatening\u201d. The grenade the taskforce threw into the apartment was a stun grenade. It was designed to subdue, not to kill. The fact that he wasn\u2019t killed when you were caught clearly displays killing him was never the objective.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Bucky was innocent!\u2019 Rogers insisted again. \u2018It was HYDRA!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You sound like a broken record.\u2019 Storm inclined her head. \u2018Tell me, what exactly do you think would happen if Sgt. Barnes was found guilty of murder?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He\u2019s not guilty\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018That is not what I asked.\u2019 Storm interrupted him. \u2018I asked you what you think will happen if he is found guilty.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I won\u2019t let them execute Bucky!\u2019 Rogers snapped.</p>\n<p>Wilson, Barton, and Romanoff looked at him funny.</p>\n<p>Logan lifted his eyes. \u2018Called it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019 Rogers demanded.</p>\n<p>\u2018Steve,\u2019 Wilson said, \u2018execution is not in force in this state.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018...What?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018As for him being innocent.\u2019 Storm tapped a few things on the iPad. She then turned the iPad around and held it up. \u2018See this man? This was the man Sgt. Barnes acquired that motorcycle from in Bucharest. He ripped him from the bike and threw him into oncoming traffic. It was a new bike this poor man was taking for a spin. He died on scene. Was <em>that</em> the Winter Soldier who did that?\u2019</p>\n<p>Wilson opened and shut his mouth a few times, then he averted his eyes.</p>\n<p>Rogers stared at the picture. He swallowed audibly. \u2018Bucky was scared! They were going to kill him...\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We just told you they weren\u2019t.\u2019 Storm turned the iPad back to herself and manipulated it again. \u2018But, if you insist, let\u2019s talk about the taskforce. They were German counter-terrorist officers who were just following orders. You used excessive force on them and killed over half of them. Of the survivors, three are permanently crippled. The remaining men are in comas and they are not expected to ever wake up again.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Excessive...? I didn\u2019t\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh, please!\u2019 Logan rolled his eyes. \u2018Little thing called CCTV, Rogers. We\u2019ve seen the footage. You threw your little Frisbee at them and put effort into punching and kicking them. Do you have any idea how much stronger than them you are?\u2019 He stuck his cigar in his mouth and lit it. \u2018There should be a rule that until anyone with super-strength works out how much stronger they are than the average Joe, they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to touch baseline humans.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers looked so offended. It was hilarious. \u2018We\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Collapsed a tunnel during knock-off traffic,\u2019 Logan interrupted him again.</p>\n<p>\u201834 people were injured,\u2019 Storm said. \u201852 were killed. There are currently 9 people reported as missing, who are suspected to have been in the area. Out of those, 12 are confirmed to be children. You did that not to protect any innocent people, but to protect a single man who happens to be your best friend \u2013 at the expense of the innocent people.\u2019</p>\n<p>The colour had drained out of Wilson\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Rogers was slowly shaking his head, trying to deny it.</p>\n<p>\u2018And that\u2019s what it\u2019s always been about, ain\u2019t it?\u2019 Logan remarked. \u2018Protecting your buddy. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t tell Tony Stark about his parents.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I...\u2019</p>\n<p>Barton was the one who interrupted him this time. \u2018What about Tony\u2019s parents?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Howard and Maria Stark were in actual fact murdered by the Winter Soldier,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018Mr. Rogers knew about it since 2014 and made the decision not to tell Mr. Stark. It was only in the Siberian bunker that he found out, by watching a video tape of the event.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It wasn\u2019t Bucky!\u2019 Rogers insisted. \u2018Tony shouldn\u2019t have attacked him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He didn\u2019t attack him first, as I recall,\u2019 Logan said. \u2018He punched you in the face and then Barnes turned his rifle on him.\u2019</p>\n<p>That impression of a landed fish was quite amusing.</p>\n<p>\u2018How did you expect him to react?\u2019 Clint asked. \u2018He watches his parents being murdered with the killer standing right there. I\u2019ve seen people snap into murderous rages over less than that!\u2019 He frowned as something seemed to click. \u2018And...knowing you, you probably responded to it by beating him up.\u2019 He looked at Logan. \u2018That\u2019s why you beat Cap up, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yup.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint shook his head and turned his back.</p>\n<p>Rogers glared at them. \u2018Who are you people?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We are mutants,\u2019 the Professor said. \u2018We were born with a mutation that allows us a vast variety of powers. For centuries, people like us have existed. We have been the victims of xenophobic aggression and ostracism from all society. We manifest our powers in adolescence. Human law rarely recognises our existence and provides us with no protections. That is, until the Accords were drafted and Logan took the first steps to securing our protection under them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers shook his head. \u2018The Accords will just turn you into government attack dogs, you and your children.\u2019</p>\n<p>The four mutants smiled in amusement.</p>\n<p>\u2018He hasn\u2019t read them, has he?\u2019 Storm asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018No,\u2019 Logan said.</p>\n<p>\u2018On the contrary, Mr. Rogers,\u2019 Hank said, \u2018the Accords are a set of checks and balances that allow us to be considered human beings and, as such, allow us access to our human rights. They allow us to negotiate for our specific conditions, and our children finally have a support system in place for the unexpected event of their powers manifesting. The vast majority of the mutant and enhanced communities are heavily in favour of them. Yourself and your cohort are the exception to the rule.\u2019</p>\n<p>Rogers drew back. Wilson swallowed heavily. Maximoff said nothing, still seething. Romanoff and Barton didn\u2019t look impressed.</p>\n<p>Hank went on. \u2018In the time between the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. and when you were apprehended, attacks on mutants and other enhanced individuals skyrocketed. It is unknown precisely how many were attacked but many were struck in unprovoked assaults which left them injured and, in some cases, dead. During your \u201cCivil War\u201d, the homes of such enhanced individuals were even attacked.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I can\u2019t be\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p>Logan was kind of getting sick of interrupting this guy. \u2018Let him finish.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Then Logan apprehended the Black Widow,\u2019 Hank said. \u2018These attacks dropped by 12%. For each enhanced individual that stepped in to view and, in some cases, signed the Accords, the attacks dropped even further. There is still the odd attack here and there, but now the attackers can be persecuted under the law without the police presuming that the enhanced individual provoked their attacker in some way.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Several community centres are being set up with support networks for those minors who suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves in possession of powers,\u2019 the Professor went on. \u2018They are run mostly by volunteers. Mutants and other enhanced individuals in the workforce are now gaining the protections from the law that their peers and co-workers are already entitled to \u2013 of which they were deprived of until now. This was something Dr. McCoy and myself had been working towards for years. It is only through the Accords that this progress was made.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We came here to tell you that.\u2019 Storm tucked her iPad away. \u2018You may think that the Accords are a bad thing, but the rest of the world does not agree. Your selfish actions made things worse for the thousands of other super-powered individuals across the planet because you were only interested in what <em>you</em> wanted. Tony and Logan were the ones who made it better.\u2019</p>\n<p>The four of them turned and headed out.</p>\n<p>\u2018Hang on, what happened to Scott?\u2019 Wilson called.</p>\n<p>\u2018Scott Lang?\u2019 One of the guards chuckled in disbelief. \u2018He violated parole to help you. He\u2019s back in prison.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018When Stark Industries released the list of charges it would be pressing against the Rogue Avengers, everyone questioned that \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d charges against Steven Grant Rogers and Natalia Alianova Romanov, otherwise known as Captain America and Natasha Romanoff. It turns out those charges are entirely accurate.\u2019</p>\n<p>The news anchor glanced down at her notes.</p>\n<p>\u2018In the courthouse today, a video tape was shown of Howard and Maria Stark being brutally murdered by the Winter Soldier. This is a shocking divorce from the previously-held belief that their alleged accident was caused by Howard Stark being inebriated behind the wheel. The case has now been reopened and a carefully selected investigative team has been assembled to review the evidence.\u2019</p>\n<p>Her co-anchor picked up the story then. \u2018Following the viewing of the first video, a second was shown. The second video was CCTV footage from the Siberian HYDRA bunker. Tony Stark learned the truth by watching the aforementioned videotape with the killer standing only a few feet away from him. After an attempt at denial, Steve Rogers admitted he had known and intentionally kept the information to himself. When Tony Stark confronted him in prison at a later date, in the face of Mr. Stark\u2019s quite understandable anger Rogers attempted to shift the blame to Miss Romanova by stating, quote, \u201cwe decided it was best not to bring up old wounds\u201d and then revealing that the former Russian spy had been aware of the fact as well.\u2019</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A group of kids sat in a diner, arguing over a newspaper article.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, you can\u2019t blame him for thinking Bucky\u2019d be put to death,\u2019 one kid argued. \u2018He is from the 40s. They did that stuff back then!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So what?\u2019 another kid argued. \u2018The other guy \u2013 that Logan guy \u2013 he was born in the old days. He didn\u2019t grow up with cars, or phones, or computers, and he uses all that stuff.\u2019</p>\n<p>A third kid lifted his head from his milkshake. \u2018How come he\u2019s alive anyway?\u2019</p>\n<p>The second kid looked over at him. \u2018They said he\u2019s got this weird genetic quirk that means he heals quick and he ages slow. Lots of people think it was an accident.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Then how could he beat up two super-soldiers?\u2019 the first kid asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Hold on.\u2019 The third kid pulled out his phone. \u2018I\u2019ll look it up.\u2019 After a moment of searching. \u2018Oh, he was illegally experimented on in the 70s. It was a Stark building, and the guys lied to Howard Stark about what they were actually doing, but the older Stark found out anyway. They reckon he got his super-strength there.\u2019</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 the therapist said. \u2018so tell me precisely what you\u2019re confused about.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I find...emotions in general to be very strange,\u2019 Vision said. \u2018Wanda did assault me, after I thought there was genuine affection between us, pushing me through 19 floors of concrete, but I still felt incredible concern for her through the fight at the airport. Even now I am shocked when I learn of her actions against the people who were supposed to be her allies. I do not understand her self-serving actions at all.\u2019</p>\n<p>The therapist nodded, but inside his mind was racing. The Vision had been sent to him in order to try and make sense of his emotions. He had only lived for a single year, and he had all the emotional understanding of a child of that age. At the same time, he was far more intelligent and logical than any human of equivalent age.</p>\n<p>How did one go about treating a synthetic human who had been on the recieving end of a one-sided abusive relationship with a woman who had clearly and shamelessly taken advantage of him? It was a completely unique situation. But his patient was relying on him to help him through this and Tony Stark had determined him a trustworthy therapist for Vision to confide in.</p>\n<p>\u2018Emotions are difficult for all of us,\u2019 he explained. The first thing would be to reassure him that nothing he was thinking or feeling was unusual in any way whatsoever. The Vision was here because he needed to talk through the emotions and confusion that he was feeling as a result of the events of the media-dubbed Civil War. \u2018What was your relationship with Wanda like prior to the event?\u2019</p>\n<p>It would probably be better to start at the beginning and work through the sequence of events as they happened.</p>\n<p>\u2018I had thought it was a positive one,\u2019 Vision said. \u2018But she would often be projecting. I now realise that she was inducing the antagonism upon Tony at these times.\u2019</p>\n<p>Oh...dear.</p>\n<p>\u2018You weren\u2019t affected?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No, I don\u2019t think so. I would sense the projections happening but they seemed to bounce right off of this,\u2019 he touched a finger to the stone imbedded in his forehead, \u2018and I never felt any antagonism for Tony myself. I do wonder if the stone was protecting me.\u2019</p>\n<p>Quite likely.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u2018So what happens now?\u2019 Peter Parker asked as he and Mr. Stark walked through Stark Industries.</p>\n<p>\u2018Logan\u2019s joining the X-Men,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018The UN\u2019s got some recommendations for a new batch of Avengers. Barnes will likely spend quite a while in a psychiatric hospital. Turns out the brainwashing program worked by tearing up a fair bit of his grey matter.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Is that why it didn\u2019t work on Logan?\u2019 Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony chuckled. \u2018Turns out, the reason those other Winter Soldiers didn\u2019t work either was because Logan not only induced doubt on them but he induced a pack mentality in them and they turned on their handlers. It was almost like what happened to Barnes when Rogers was around.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u2018So how did that Zemo guy play it so well? Can he see the future or something?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Nope,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018When HYDRA decided to kill someone, they would have their profilers study the target\u2019s behaviour for a while, as well as the behaviour of the people around the target, in order to find the cleanest way to kill them without being caught. Zemo was one of these profilers. He was trained so he could pick out Rogers\u2019 behaviour in a short amount of time and the behaviour of the rest of us too. Apparently, Rogers had a small group to study compared to what he\u2019s used to.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018So it was really easy.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Very easy.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What about Scott Lang?\u2019 Peter asked. \u2018He broke parole, didn\u2019t he?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yup.\u2019 Tony looked amused. \u2018His ex-wife called Pepper to pass on an apology for his behaviour to me and explain that he\u2019s an idiot.\u2019 He paused. \u2018I also got a phone call from Hope Van Dyne to apologise for the exact same thing. She also made her father apologise to me.\u2019 Tony grinned. \u2018On facetime. The man looked so constipated.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter looked adorably confused, like a puppy who couldn\u2019t figure something out. \u2018What\u2019s his problem with you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018A feud with my father, basically.\u2019 Tony frowned. He wouldn\u2019t say it to Pete, but the fact was Tony had found the incident for that feud in with the S.H.I.E.L.D. files. Howard had expressed an interest in the Pym Particles and Hank Pym had said \u201cno\u201d. That was it. Then suddenly Pym was accusing Howard of having interferred with them.</p>\n<p>Howard hadn\u2019t denied it, had instead behaved in an exasperated manner. It had been translated to \u201cyes, I did it, and I\u2019m annoyed at being caught\u201d. However, the others who\u2019d known of it had later been exposed as HYDRA agents: Alexander Price and Mitchell Carson. It indicated to Tony that Howard just couldn\u2019t be bothered defending himself against people who wouldn\u2019t listen. <em>Was dad subject to the same kind of scapegoating that the Avengers did to me?</em></p>\n<p>Maybe he should look into that.</p>\n<p>\u2018That doesn\u2019t make sense!\u2019 Peter insisted. \u2018That\u2019s your dad, not you!\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony smiled. \u2018Happens a lot actually. People from the same family often get tarred with the same brush. It\u2019s the same reason stereotyping happens. It\u2019s just easier to make generalisations than it is to get to know independant people.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter sighed. \u2018So...what happens with the Avengers now?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We reform,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018You still want to be an Avenger?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah!\u2019 Peter nodded so much Tony was sure his brain was shaking around in his skull.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, you\u2019ll go into training until you\u2019re 18 then,\u2019 Tony said. \u2018They\u2019re drawing up a set of guidelines for Avengers recruitment and I\u2019m sure minors will come into it if they haven\u2019t already.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201818?\u2019 Peter groaned. \u2018But that\u2019s <em>ages</em> away!\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony grinned. \u2018Well, it\u2019d be the same if you wanted to join the police force. Besides, Pep would kill us if we tried to skip it.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter winced. \u2018Miss Potts is really scary.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes, she is.\u2019 Tony looked over him. \u2018How\u2019d your aunt take it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018She thought I was joking at first,\u2019 Peter said. \u2018So I stuck to the ceiling. Then she got mad at me.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Of course she did. Her 15 year old nephew is running around fighting crime. That\u2019d send any parent through the roof.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u2018In the meantime,\u2019 Tony flicked up some schematics, \u2018I designed a new suit for you. Tell me what you think of this.\u2019</p>\n<p>With a grin, Peter trotted over.</p>"
