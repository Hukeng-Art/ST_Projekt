I\u2019m not an expert in him or anything, but I may be at an advantage here at knowing some things most people aren\u2019t privy too. It\u2019s nothing too explicit, just things that are common knowledge here, so don\u2019t go ragging on me for sharing lol.

And don\u2019t get me wrong, I hope that\u2019s the case but a lot of people are saying otherwise? So now that the flailing and shock is gone by now\u2026 Did we really see a kiss?</p>\n<p>None of the TV cameras were able to get a good angle so we\u2019re left wondering. (Proof: <u>video compilation of all the angles taken</u>, but none of them show anything because Victor\u2019S DAMN ARM) Also, it looked like they shared words after, but again, no one knows what they said for sure.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the consensus folks?

No surprise. A male-male coach-skater pair, however? A little eyebrow raising. Usually we like to stick to two people who compete together in the court, field, rink, or wherever, but we\u2019re bending the rules a little for Yuuri and Victor.</p>\n<p>The figure skating community experienced a more than mild uproar when Russian living legend figure skater Victor Nikiforov announced taking the season off earlier this year. And when it was found out that he was coaching 2015 Grand Prix Final\u2019s 6th placer Yuuri Katsuki in the meantime, well, didn\u2019t that cause a lot of tongues to waggle.</p>\n<p>But over the course of the year, the pair\u2019s chemistry became more and more undeniable. From Victor\u2019s constant instagram and twitter posts, to little moments captured on camera (more rink-side hugs than any other figure skating pair this year -- we counted), to Yuuri constantly seducing Victor with his \u201cOn Love: Eros\u201d routine -- it was no wonder people (all of us) were starting to think their relationship was more than platonic.</p>\n<p>And we were all proven right during the Cup of China, when the viral so-called \u201cVictuuri Kiss\u201d happened.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[ image ]</p>\n<p align=\"center\">(Sweet, sweet <strike> victory </strike> victuuri)</p>\n<p>Trust me, we all screamed when it happened, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Facebook Conversations</b>\n</p>\n<p>Sort by: Top</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Katerina Johnson</b>\n</p>\n<p>SMH Yuuri and Victor should\u2019ve been #1</p>\n<p>Like.

I would like to apologize beforehand if it\u2019s not easy to understand, as English is not my first language and I\u2019m possibly ranting a little bit.</p>\n<p>Last year, a lot of people criticized Yuuri Katsuki for getting the pressure get to him at his (first!) GPF. Today, I\u2019m seeing a lot of the same regarding JJ Leroy\u2019s short program performance.</p>\n<p>If you didn\u2019t watch today\u2019s performances, JJ is currently in last place at a personal low of 86.71 points after flubbing most of his jumps in his short program. From what we can glean, it seems like he possibly had an anxiety attack early on his program that affected the rest of his performance. To give him credit, it did look like he tried to snap out of it, but as all of us that have experienced it before know, most of the time it\u2019s not that easy.</p>\n<p>I skate competitively in local competitions. I know a lot of skaters. For many of us, the nerves never really go away and the best we can do is skate our way through it. Feeling nervous is natural and nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to be shamed by. Because imagine this:</p>\n<p>You\u2019re the top skater of your country. You\u2019re the best your country has to offer. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been selected to represent your country.</p>\n<p>Your family, friends, and fans - they want and expect you to do your best. They mean well, but the expectations of those you know almost always weigh heavier than of strangers\u2019.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re in the Grand Prix, and in the Final at that, where only the best of the best can compete in. You\u2019re expected to do your personal bests and make your country proud by performing as perfectly as you can.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, something has to give.</p>\n<p>The pressure of professional sports is hard to comprehend if you haven\u2019t experienced it. So I would just like to remind everyone to take consideration of what the athletes are experiencing before you criticize or explicitly vocalize your \u201cdisappointment\u201d (which to what I have seen, is borderline bashing sometimes).</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\n<b>nikifaverov</b>\n</p>\n<p>Your English is fine! I understand how hard it is to express yourself in a secondary language, but I was able to get the gist of it, even as an ESL myself.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your post though. I hope people take note of it and tone down with the extreme criticism.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\n<b>understatedgarments</b>\n</p>\n<p>I kinda wish this was around last year, but better late than never.</p>\n<p>But yeah, I\u2019m getting uncomfortable flashbacks to the Yuuri Katsuki hate train last year so I\u2019m glad this is being pointed out. People forget that for some professional sports, it\u2019s not only about physical well-being, but also mental well-being as well.<br> </p>\n<p>Source: sunnyskates #good post #figure skating</p>\n<p>32,091 notes<br> </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>[Grand Prix Final 2016]</b>SP is over, ranking predictions?

He also has a big lead over everyone else after his SP (new WR wtf). If he nails it perfectly like he did his SP, then he\u2019s guaranteed gold.</p>\n<p>Giacometti has a reputation of catching up very well in his FS. He\u2019s been constantly second to Victor for the past few competitions they\u2019ve both been in, and if it weren\u2019t for that 16 point difference between him and Plisetsky, I\u2019d would\u2019ve said he\u2019d take gold.</p>\n<p>Now, Altin is a dark horse but he did get bronze at the last World\u2019s, and he\u2019s currently second place, so it\u2019s an ideal place for him to be at for him to stand on the podium. But, Katsuki\u2019s FS this year is strong PCS and TES wise, so if he nails all his program components - especially the quad flip at the end of his program - then he has a real shot of making up all the points he lost in the SP and at least getting bronze.</p>\n<p>On Chulanont and Leroy: Chulanont, despite winning gold at the Cup of China, I don\u2019t think can match up the other programs especially since he\u2019s comparatively weaker with his quads. His score is heavily dependent on his PCS. I think he shines when he\u2019s more focused on performing and entertaining the crowd, which won him China in the first place.</p>\n<p>Now Leroy. Oh JJ. His SP was a mess. He did evidently try to recover, but his score suffered poorly by his messed up jumps. Depending on how his FS goes, he maaaaaaay recover and grab fifth or even fourth if someone else messes up worse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri Katsuki Fan Club (<b>katsuki_fc</b>) wrote</p>\n<p>@ <u> 2016 </u> - <u> 12 </u> - <u> xx </u> \u00a0 <em> 08:39 am </em></p>\n<p>Entry tags: +<u> grand prix 2016 </u> + <u> watch party </u></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b> <em>Grand Prix 2016 Watch Party DAY TWO</em> </b><br> </p>\n<p>Today is the free program and they\u2019ll be skating according to the short program rankings from lowest to highest score!</p>\n<p>Skate order is as follows:</p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<p>and most importantly,</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[Page 4 of 137]</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[<u><b>&lt;&lt;</b></u> 1 2 3 <b>4 </b>\u2026135 136 137 <u><b>&gt;&gt;</b></u>]</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Anonymous)</p>\n<p>i\u2019m not a big fan of jj but i\u2019m rooting for him today</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Anonymous)</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Same.

Get a little sentimental here.</p>\n<p>Because this time last year we were a little less than 100 members, and only 20 pages in comments for the entire weekend. In comparison to the other grand prix finalists last year, the collective Yuuri Katsuki non-Japanese fandom was a respectable size, but not comparable to the other skaters.</p>\n<p>And look where we are now.</p>\n<p>3,501 members (a lot of you still lurkin\u2019 anons, but I see youuu) and that\u2019s just in this site, which let\u2019s be real, is a dying platform. The <u>/r/katsyuudon</u> subreddit 11,081 subscribers as I type this, and it\u2019s growing each day. Our Tumblr counterpart <u>yuurikatsuki-fc</u> has 41,928 followers. And let\u2019s not forget our fellow fans in Japan - their <u>top Yuuri fansite/forum</u> boasts a fantastic 398,923 followers.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve grown as a fandom together with Yuuri this past year, and it gives me FEELS to see how far we\u2019ve gone. I\u2019ve been an unapologetic Yuuri fan since the beginning, and every time I watch and support him through his low and high points with everyone, I feel like will never be anything else otherwise.</p>\n<p>I am so so proud of everyone, and especially of Yuuri. He suffered harsh criticism and people telling him to retire early on this year, but he turned it all around to better himself and started being more open about his struggles with anxiety, showing us a whole new side of him. This season has been a new starting point for both the fandom and Yuuri (and Victor, let\u2019s not forget the man who encouraged the possibility), and I\u2019m crying. Legit tears.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens for the rest of the season, remember how far our favorite skater has gotten, and let\u2019s keep cheering Yuuri-chan on.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Yuuri, and keep doing your best!</p>\n<p>EDIT: Sort of related, but a <u> \u201cThank You, Yuuri\u201d Project </u> is being started by the tumblr fc, prompted by <u> this really moving open letter</u> from a young amateur skater. Please check it out and consider participating. Our boy needs constant reminders that he\u2019s very much appreciated and admired as a skater and a person.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[Page 1 of 29]</p>\n<p align=\"center\">[<u><b>&lt;&lt;</b></u> <b>1</b> 2 3 4 5 \u2026 29 <u><b>&gt;&gt;</b></u>]</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Anonymous)</p>\n<p>MOD-SAN ;A;</p>\n<p>MOD-SAN WE LOVE YOU</p>\n<p>(Anonymous)</p>\n<p>oh god now i have ALL THE FEELS ;-;</p>\n<p>(katsudone)</p>\n<p>Thank you for everything, mod-san &lt;3</p>\n<p>(demiguises)</p>\n<p>mod-san, you\u2019ll always be #1 yuuri fan in our hearts ((u can fite me, minami kenjirou))</p>\n<p>(Anonymous)</p>\n<p>I\u2019m so glad for all of you.
