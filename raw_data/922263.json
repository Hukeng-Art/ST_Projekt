I'm going to try my hand at other POVs in the next two chapters. I've only written in \"Jim\" but I want to try Senik and Spock.

He had to be sneaky.</p>\n<p>I do want to write that scene. I have a thing for hands. And dessert. Yum.</p>\n<p>Thank you, as always, for your kind replies and comments.

  "text": "<p>\u201c... <em> which marks the beginning of the First Republic of Bajor, which flourished between twenty and twenty-five thousand years ago </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim sighed, propping his head in his hand, and tried to keep his eyes open. This did not bode well for the semester.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> This period can be characterized by the great accomplishments of art, science, mathematics </em>...\u201d</p>\n<p>His advisors warned him to get the history credit before his final year, but he ignored it, and now he understood why. No one should be expected to do a thesis, advanced tactical and command courses, and a campus job on top of the world\u2019s most boring class at 0800 hours.</p>\n<p>\u201c... <em> as evidenced by the classical architecture seen in B\u2019hala by the great designer and artist, Sarisen. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim doodled a few notes on his PADD and let his gaze wander. The lecture hall was half filled with first-year cadets in their first week, as evidenced by eager expressions and frantic note-taking. Jim was sitting in the optimal spot: almost in the back of the room, an aisle seat nearest the door, something these fresh-faced cadets hadn\u2019t learned just yet. He glanced around, noting a pair of cute Human girls to his left and a trim-looking Kressari male a few rows ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\u201c... <em> upon which the Bajoran caste system was built. Such evidence of these findings </em>...\u201d</p>\n<p>And right in the middle of the room of a sea of cadet red uniforms, in the first row, the seat closest to the lecturer (a space that even cadets in their first week knew not to occupy) sat a lone Vulcan. This caught Jim\u2019s curiosity immediately. He stuck out with his pointy ears, unfortunate choice of seating, black Vulcan robes, and he was puny. Vulcans were usually tall, and this guy looked like a child compared to the other students. Jim stared at him a few moments more, noticing that he didn\u2019t even twitch, just stared at the professor, hands clasped, and not even taking notes.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> This calls for speculation to which of the first expeditions to Bajoran space yielded, what scholars later called... </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s PADD lit up with a message from his roommate.</p>\n<p>\n<b>lmccoy: Late night? I thought you said you didn\u2019t have time for bed hopping this semester.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Jim stifled a snort and typed a reply.</p>\n<p>\n<b>jkirk: I slept in my room, unlike some. Early class this semester.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>lmccoy: Lunch at 1300?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>jkirk: can\u2019t. work.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> That concludes today\u2019s lecture </em>.\u201d No sooner did those words leave the professor\u2019s mouth, than Jim stood up and started making his way down the stairs to the door. As he got there, the short Vulcan came into view. Jim got a good look at him and realized with a shock that he was wrong.</p>\n<p>The tiny Vulcan wasn\u2019t short, like a kid. He<em> was </em>a kid.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>If there was one thing to be said for HIST108: Non-Federation Civilizations, it was easy, allowing Jim to multitask. He could listen to the lecture, take the occasional note, and read for his Interspecies Ethics class. Or Exochemistry. Or Advanced Astrotheory. Or any of the other six courses he was taking this semester because he was a glutton for punishment and saw his ticket off Earth at the end of the finish line.</p>\n<p>Two weeks had gone by, and they had covered Bajor, Selay, and Kesprytt III. He aced his Command and Conduct essay and found a great study group for Advanced Subspace Geometry, which was one of the few times he had this semester for anything that resembled socializing.</p>\n<p>Not that he hadn\u2019t had offers. In his history class, especially, a number of the first-year cadets had chatted him up, including the pair of Humans, a rather handsy Andorian, and a Breen doing a semester at Starfleet as a cultural exchange. <em> Breen</em>. Seriously weird.</p>\n<p>The little Vulcan kid was still in the class, still sitting in no man's land, attentively listening and never fidgeting. Jim hadn\u2019t given him more than a cursory glance until week three, when the handsy Andorian tripped over the kid\u2019s satchel before class, making the blue man spill his morning drink over his uniform. Jim only barely missed getting splashed on his way to his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Qi\u2019tarr\u2019wae </em>,\u201d the Andorian snarled. \u201cYour boots will be in water.\u201d Which probably didn\u2019t sound like much, except to those that spoke Andorian and understood the implication of the slur, like Jim. The kid seemed to understand the full meaning as well, the tips of his ears turned green and he looked away, seeming to shrink in on himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Jim said in an even tone. \u201cNot his fault the bulls left you their tails.\u201d That, too, was a slur to any Andorian male. All eyes in the room were trained on the scene at the front of the room. The other man glared but didn\u2019t challenge Jim, giving the kid one more disgusted look and taking his seat. Jim glanced down. \u201cYou okay, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>The young Vulcan nodded, wide-eyed. Jim gave him a small grin and walked to his seat.</p>\n<p>The next time class met, the kid moved his seat to the very back of the room.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>On Tuesdays, Jim could find a few minutes to meet Bones for lunch, which was mostly spent stuffing his face as quickly as he could and ignoring the stink eye his roommate would give him while watching Jim eat.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrench fries don\u2019t go in your milkshake, you heathen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it,\u201d Jim replied around a mouthful of fries.</p>\n<p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d Bones muttered, trying to take his attention off Jim\u2019s train wreck of a lunch. \u201cHe\u2019s here again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim reached over to Bones\u2019 tray and tried to swipe a napkin but got his hand smacked. \u201cHey! You\u2019ve got plenty. Who\u2019s here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was here last week too,\u201d Bones mused. \u201cSame seat and everything. I think he\u2019s staring at you. No! Don\u2019t turn around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim smirked. \u201cIs he cute?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bones looked over Jim\u2019s shoulder, considering. \u201cYes. Some might say adorable. For a Vulcan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdorable?\u201d Jim repeated, intrigued. \u201cIs he my type?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bones gave him an enigmatic smile. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim scoffed and turned around. \u201cSince when don\u2019t I go for adorable men...\u201d Jim whipped back around and glared. Bones was shaking from silent laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s the kid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, kicking the doctor under the table. Bones nodded, immensely amused by himself. Jim flicked a fry at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim nodded, resuming his french fry dipping. \u201cIn my history class. The kid\u2019s auditing or something, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bones\u2019 eyes widened. \u201cHe\u2019s coming over,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>Jim looked around, and sure enough, the youth was headed his way. But instead of approaching their table, the kid kept walking and sat at another table, this time in Jim\u2019s line of sight. He pulled out a PADD and wrote some things on it, occasionally making notes and glancing at Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is looking at me,\u201d he muttered, frowning at the kid.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s shy?\u201d Bones suggested.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s a stalker,\u201d Jim muttered and picked up his empty tray. The Vulcan kid was still looking at him, eyes following him as he walked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you watching me?\u201d Jim asked.</p>\n<p>The Vulcan flushed green but did not look away. \u201cYes. I was trying to be covert, but obviously, I have failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim stifled the urge to roll his eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are many studies that indicate if the subject is aware of being observed, the subject\u2019s behavior will invariably change.\u201d</p>\n<p>Great. He was a <em> science project</em>. \u201cWhy are you watching <em> me </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am gathering data on humanoid behavior,\u201d the boy said earnestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Senik,\u201d the boy supplied.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Senik, it\u2019s great you\u2019re interested in science and all, but most humanoids don\u2019t appreciate being secretly watched. It\u2019s creepy. Either stop doing it or ask permission first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded solemnly and Jim left to dump his tray.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Jim worked at the Starfleet library in the astrometrics processing lab desk. It was both the best and worst job in the solar system, but Jim was magnificently suited for it. Every workday he took the bike across the bay from the Academy campus in Sausalito to \u2018Fleet HQ in San Francisco. He sat at a counter for a few hours, with minimal interruptions, and occasionally pressed a button on a machine or answered a patron\u2019s question. He could spend the rest of the time studying, which was a huge bonus and far outweighed any tedium of button pushing and minimal foot traffic to his area.</p>\n<p>So it was unusual when the minute his shift started, a patron was already waiting at his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a fan of astrometrics?\u201d Jim asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am interested in a great many topics,\u201d Senik said, glancing around the empty room and desks that made up Jim's area.</p>\n<p>Jim waited silently and when it was obvious the youth was not going to speak, he cleared his throat and got Senik\u2019s attention. \u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I observe you in this environment?\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, the kid got points for following the rules. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause my data will be compromised by your knowledge of my observation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim was unaccountably amused. \u201cIt was a rhetorical question.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Senik nodded once. \u201cWhat is it that you do here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim pointed to the two machines behind him. \u201cIf they beep, I press the buttons. If someone needs help finding astrometrics data stored in the database, I help them retrieve it. I spend the rest of the time studying. Make sense?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded. \u201cShould I move away from the desk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim gestured to the empty room. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep all the other people waiting, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik looked behind him and then back to Jim. \u201cThere are no other people here, Cadet Kirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim rolled his eyes. \u201cStand wherever you like. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded, and Jim started typing at a computer console. He tried to concentrate on writing his tactical analysis report of this morning\u2019s simulation but was very aware of Senik standing at the desk. He glanced up once and sure enough, the Vulcan youth was staring at Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am somewhat unfamiliar with Terran social rules,\u201d Senik replied, but took the hint and averted his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you say you are observing, are you observing me? Just me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded once. \u201cHowever, I believe I have observed enough, at this time,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI require your assistance, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>James looked up expectantly. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you currently engaged in a relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is part of the data I am collecting,\u201d Senik replied.</p>\n<p>Jim decided to humor him. \u201cNo. I\u2019m single.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded. \u201cDo you have a gender preference? Or preference for any species, humanoid or otherwise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo, not particularly.\u201d Senik nodded again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI request your assistance in another matter,\u201d the boy announced and Jim nodded warily for him to continue. \u201cI wish for you to accompany me to dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s eyebrows shot up to his hairline. \u201cDinner? Kid, I think you got the wrong idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure you are a nice young person, I do have a preference for adults. I mean all the time. Adults only. That\u2019s the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik tilted his head quizzically. \u201cYou misunderstand, Cadet Kirk. I am not requesting to partake in Human courtship. I have no interest in you in that manner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jim said faintly, not entirely sure that was an improvement. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad we have that settled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you accompany me to dinner? There is a suitable establishment outside the library and--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, kid,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI really don\u2019t have much time for that sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHumans require nourishment and social interaction to maintain optimum performance,\u201d Senik pointed out. \u201cIt would be efficient to combine the two activities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m functioning just fine, thanks,\u201d Jim said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a paper due next week, so unless you\u2019ve already audited Interspecies Ethics or have a first-hand knowledge of the interspecies marriage practices--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can assist you in your Interspecies Ethics class,\u201d Senik interjected. \u201cDuring dinner,\u201d he added for clarification. \u201cIt would be the most efficient use of your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim frowned. \u201cYou know about interspecies marriage laws?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can assist you,\u201d Senik repeated earnestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about your time? Aren\u2019t your parents expecting you home?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy's face shuttered. \u201cNo. My mother is currently aboard the USS Stokholm.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer any more information, but Jim could fill in the wide gaps of knowledge with his own experiences. He considered a moment, and Senik met his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I get off in three and a half hours.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Senik nodded...</p>\n<p>And stood silently in front of Jim for the next three hours and twenty-nine minutes.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Senik led Jim to an eatery a block from the library, a fusion restaurant that catered to the diverse palates of Star Fleet personnel. It was a tad sophisticated for what was supposed to be, in Jim\u2019s mind, a study session with a precocious pre-adolescent. The intimate tables had cloth napkins and real candles, a far cry from three full years of cafeteria food and greasy dives. A cheery hostess led them into a nearly deserted dining room and a waitress brought them their drinks, a Coke and tea. Jim perused the menu, sipping on his soda when he noticed Senik staring at his beverage.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour drink is carbonated?\u201d he asked, obviously intrigued.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jim nodded and pushed the drink toward the boy. \u201cWant to try it?\u201d Senik shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you had it?\u201d Jim asked. The boy shook his head again. \u201cThen how do you know if you don\u2019t like it?\u201d Jim tried not to dwell on how much he sounded like his mother and pushed the drink closer to the boy. Senik tentatively took the glass and held it up to observe. Jim watched expectantly, thinking all the ice in the glass would melt before Senik tried a sip. Suddenly, Senik put the glass down and pushed it back towards Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpock,\u201d Senik said suddenly without explanation.</p>\n<p>Jim frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s spock mean?\u201d Was it Vulcan slang?</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Spock,\u201d a smooth voice said from behind Jim\u2019s head. Jim turned around to see a tall, lean Vulcan male. This was Lieutenant Commander Spock, by the looks of his instructor\u2019s uniform. Jim pushed back his chair and stood at attention, out of habit. Spock ignored him. \u201cSenik, you were expected to be home at 1700 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have asked one of my classmates to partake in a meal with me,\u201d Senik replied, avoiding the adult Vulcan\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt was not my intent to cause a disruption to your evening, tomasu.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock glanced at the Human, still standing formally. \u201cIf you had informed me of your plans, there would have been no disruption. You did not answer your comm, but I was able to triangulate a signal.\u201d He turned to face Jim fully. \u201cCadet, you are excused.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim glanced over to Senik, who was obviously displeased. \u201cCadet Kirk cannot leave. My obligation to him is unfulfilled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock turned to Jim, questioning. \u201cWhat obligation does this child have to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim frowned, disliking the accusing tone. It\u2019s not like he abducted the kid. \u201cSir, I\u2019m not sure if-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assured him that I could assist him with his Interspecies Ethics course,\u201d Senik said firmly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That made Spock turn back to the youth. \u201cThis assistance could be as effectively done through other means, such as a conference video.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk\u2019s time is valuable, as his course load is 42% more demanding than the average third-year cadet. He is also employed at the library astrometrics lab, leaving little time for meals and sleep,\u201d Senik replied. \u201cCadet Kirk rarely partakes in nutritious or frequent meals. I concluded that a shared meal would be the most logical choice, benefiting all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although neither Vulcan had raised his voice, and it sounded like they were commenting on the weather, Jim got the distinct feeling he was caught in the middle of an angry family fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jim said, both pairs of eyes turning toward the Human, \u201cit\u2019s okay, I should be going anyway. That extra 42% won\u2019t get done on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock raised his hand and motioned for Jim to stay. \u201cMy apologies Cadet Kirk, please continue your meal. If you would not mind, I will join you and escort Senik home at the conclusion of the meal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Sure,\u201d Jim said, feeling incredibly awkward. Neither caught Senik\u2019s pleased expression as Spock sat next to Jim.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Jim knew a few things about Vulcans. For one, most were touch telepaths and as such, didn\u2019t appreciate casual physical contact, so Jim made an effort to keep all limbs to himself. He also knew that Vulcans were vegetarians, and in deference to his dinner companions, Jim was eating a fusion dish of vegetable lasagna with Tellarite cheese.</p>\n<p>It was revolting.</p>\n<p>After the second bite of fermented squash and cheese that reminded him of a cross of Wensleydale and feta, he abandoned his plate and tried to casually grab another roll from the communal bread basket. However, it was impossible to be discreet, because two pairs of Vulcan eyes were trained on him, unblinking and unjudging. Jim wasn\u2019t sure if they were both naturally horrible dinner conversationalists or if it was a cultural thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what can you tell me about interspecies marriage laws?\u201d Jim asked Senik.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy knowledge of the topic is minimal,\u201d the boy replied staring at his food. Jim frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you knew--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said that I would assist you,\u201d Senik corrected, spooning diced tomatoes into a brothy soup and stirring, refusing to look up. \u201cMy cousin is a product of an interspecies marriage, and would be an excellent source of knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cousin... Jim glanced at an annoyed Spock, correctly inferring that he was the cousin in question. The cousin that was responsible for Senik while his parents were away. The Vulcan (half Vulcan?) instructor's lips were firmly pressed together, but he did not move to speak or correct Senik.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it part of your plan to trick him into coming here?\u201d Jim asked, gesturing to the disgruntled adult Vulcan.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe would not have come on his own,\u201d the youth replied, still not looking up. \u201cI said I would assist you, and I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have said so,\u201d Jim admonished.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am unfamiliar with Terran social rules,\u201d Senik replied for the second time that day.</p>\n<p>The level of awkwardness just went up a few notches. Jim snuck a glance over to Spock, who looked stern, but not murderous, at the young Vulcan\u2019s bending of the truth. \u201cCadet Kirk is correct,\u201d Spock said. \u201cYou were being purposefully vague to achieve your objective. An objective that is still not entirely clear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I be excused to the restroom?\u201d Senik asked, and without a reply, got up and retreated out of the dining room, both adults staring after him, befuddled.</p>\n<p>Jim felt that the second ring of hell must be similar to this. Eating terrible alien fusion food with an adolescent under false pretenses, joined by a stern and proper Vulcan professor with perfectly trimmed hair that Jim was itching to run his fingers through, curious if he could untame the dark hair from its rigid position above slanted eyebrows.</p>\n<p>Jim sighed, and Spock\u2019s eyes swung back around to regard the cadet. \u201cI think I\u2019m his science project,\u201d Jim shared.</p>\n<p>Spock lifted one eyebrow, which Jim thought was a little incongruous on a Vulcan\u2019s face, but was oddly appealing. \u201cPlease elaborate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been watching me for a while, I guess. Observing me for a humanoid behavior project. I interrupted his observations at lunch today, so I think he\u2019s trying to watch me in unique environments.\"</p>\n<p>Spock nodded thoughtfully. \u201cSenik has been on Earth for two months and is having difficulty adjusting to life here, away from his parents. I was the one that suggested studying his classmates for insight into non-Vulcan behavior. I did not anticipate that he would be so... thorough in his pursuit of understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re raising him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis mother is of my father\u2019s house. T\u2019Mae is aboard the Stokholm on a scientific expedition from the Vulcan Science Academy and has granted me to-tashan, or guardianship, of Senik in her absence,\u201d Spock said, sipping his own Vulcan tea.</p>\n<p>Jim grabbed another roll, ripping off a piece and chewing it slowly. \u201cMust be rough for him, not having any real friends his age here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVulcans do not require social interaction in the way that Humans crave,\u201d the other man replied. Based on Senik\u2019s odd behavior, Jim had a hunch that it was not entirely true, but did not disagree. \u201cI have observed that Humans often try to draw parallels between themselves and other species where none exist, in an effort to create a relationship. It is how Humans relate to the universe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you think we all try to make others more Human because we couldn\u2019t accept other species as they are?\u201d Jim asked, a little perturbed. Spock wouldn\u2019t be the first person to accuse Humans, especially those serving in Starfleet, of giving Earth undue influence in Alpha and Beta quadrants, to the point of cultural hegemony.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Spock said. \u201cThe Human trait of empathy has proven to be a valuable trait in the formation and continuation of the Federation. I believe it is a trait that I did not naturally inherit from my Human mother, but something I learned as I grew older.\u201d</p>\n<p>Human. Spock was part Human. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m being rude for asking, but I am very interested in hearing about your parent\u2019s story, from an academic perspective, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would not be opposed,\u201d Spock said, and Jim smiled gratefully. Over the next ten minutes, Spock shared the riveting story of Human Amanda Grayson and Vulcan Ambassador Sarek, a perfect parable for interstellar law and ethics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although Jim would never admit it to anyone, let alone Lieutenant Commander Spock, the story was also terribly romantic. Jim always had a thing for star-crossed lovers.</p>\n<p>Senik watched the Human and his cousin conversing, noting the gentle tilt of Kirk\u2019s head, indicating interest. Spock\u2019s own posture had loosened, his shoulders parallel to Kirk\u2019s, also in apparent interest of the other. Senik inched closer, wondering if he could determine the diameter of Kirk\u2019s pupils from this angle.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kiddo, do you need something?\u201d a waitress asked in a condescending tone. Senik stood up from his hidden vantage point and turned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Senik replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be spying on adults,\u201d she said, shifting her tray of beverages to one hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not spying,\u201d Senik replied flatly. Spying indicated subterfuge- he was engaging in science. The waitress shrugged and left Senik to continue his observations behind the artificial ferns and started calculating Kirk\u2019s breathing patterns, which might be elevated.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>When Senik finally emerged from the artificial ferns to take his seat, Spock and Kirk had obviously allowed the conversation to end. Kirk was looking at the poor reproduction artwork on the wall, chewing on his fourth roll, his lasagna abandoned for unknown reasons, and Spock was finishing the last of his salad. Senik\u2019s own soup was probably cold at this point, all the more reason to end tonight\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, thank you for accompanying me to dinner. I hope it has not taken too much of your time,\u201d Senik said formally.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, it was...\u201d Kirk struggled to find an appropriate word. \u201cFun.\u201d</p>\n<p>An interesting word choice, and another indication of social enjoyment. Senik nodded, mentally filing that subjective report with the other data to be synthesized when he was at home and meditating.</p>\n<p>Kirk and Spock stood, saluted, and Kirk left the dining room. Senik watched Spock as his eyes followed the cadet\u2019s figure as he made his way across the street and out of sight. Spock then turned to glare at Senik.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I suggested that you study your classmates for insight into Human behavior, it was not an endorsement for waylaying Academy cadets,\u201d Spock lectured, pulling out his credit chip to pay for the meal.</p>\n<p>Senik considered Spock\u2019s words. \u201cI will endeavor to be more transparent in my efforts, as far as it does not interfere with the objective nature of my observations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat will be acceptable,\u201d Spock replied, gesturing for Senik to lead the way out the door of the restaurant.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>As was their daily routine, Senik and Spock broke their morning fast together. It was usually a silent affair. Spock had fresh fruit and oatmeal, while Senik still preferred synthesized Vulcan pir mah. Terran food had much to be desired.</p>\n<p>After compiling his observations and synthesizing the data he had collected from Cadet Kirk\u2019s first meeting with Spock, which would be referred to as the Restaurant Encounter, Senik formed a hypothesis. As Senik was almost a third through the semester, he surmised that time was of the essence and should move on to the next stage of the experiment.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk received top marks in his last three Command and Conduct courses,\u201d Senik reported, taking his seat at the small table in the kitchen. Spock looked up from his fruit and raised an eyebrow. Senik interpreted this as permission to continue. \u201cHe is often in the top ten percent of his classes. In our shared history course, he is second only to me.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you attempting Human small talk?\u201d Spock asked, confused by Senik\u2019s sudden attempt at conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk is an admirable Human,\u201d the boy said, ignoring his cousin\u2019s question. \u201cI find him to be intelligent, honorable, and industrious. Did you not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could not say,\u201d Spock said carefully, still unsure of Senik\u2019s intent. \u201cI would remind you that most Humans prefer to socialize with peers of their own age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded. \u201cCadet Kirk is 26.3 Terran cycles old,\u201d he said and then looked meaningfully at Spock. \u201c1.6 cycles fewer than your own age. Cadet Kirk would prefer to socialize with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock blinked. \u201cI think not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik pressed on. \u201cHe is in the Command track at the Academy, finishing his final year. My research indicates that he is very likely to receive a commission aboard the Shenandoah, Farragut, or most likely the Enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock considered this information for 1.9 seconds longer than necessary. Intriguing. \u201cHow does your research allow you to come to such conclusions?\u201d Spock asked, reaching for his tea.</p>\n<p>Senik flushed a light green, a deeply embarrassing habit that most of his peers had long grown out of, but Spock had never commented on it. \u201cMy afternoon classes are near the tactical training bays. Many of the instructors communicate regularly with Starfleet in the faculty lounge, which has poorly placed ventilation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were eavesdropping,\u201d Spock supplied. Senik nodded. Spock looked down at him sternly. \u201cIt is inappropriate to listen to conversations you are not meant to be privy to. You may have heard classified information. I instruct you never to repeat anything you have heard to me, or any other being. Is that understood?\u201d Senik nodded again and turned to his breakfast.</p>\n<p>All in all, he considered breakfast to be a success for science.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>When Senik\u2019s mother took a position as a scientist aboard the Stockholm, he was given two choices: to stay in the house of his estranged father, Stutok, or be fostered by his distant cousin, Spock. If pressed, Senik could not clearly outline the reasoning used to choose Spock over his father. Stutok could provide a proper Vulcan education, and the household staff would see to his needs adequately. It was a logical option, but one that Senik ultimately passed over.</p>\n<p>Senik had grown up hearing the whispers of Spock, son of Sarek and the Lady Amanda. He was a toddler when Spock declined a position at the Vulcan Science Academy to apply to Starfleet, a scandal that rippled through the scientific community. T\u2019Mae, his mother, voiced no opinion on the matter as a scientist or relative, but every Vulcan child at school had somehow had something to say about half-Human Spock. Blood traitor. <em> Kre\u2019nath</em>. Bastard. Senik once repeated what he had heard to T\u2019Mae.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuhik,\u201d she had said. <em> Foolish </em> . \u201cK\u2019lalatar prkori k\u2019lalatar prnak\u2019lirli.\u201d <em> Infinite diversity in infinite combinations</em>. To discount Spock was illogical and to celebrate his uniqueness was what it meant to be Vulcan. \"Although some do not remember,\" she went on to say. <em> Some</em>, he would later learn, included his father.</p>\n<p>Three years later, Senik saw Spock for the first time. He had returned to Vulcan just before his graduation from Starfleet Academy, poised to be one of its most distinguished graduates. T\u2019Mae brought Senik to pay their respects to their cousin. At the tender age of six, he spent the entirety of the visit standing at his mother\u2019s elbow watching the adults converse, particularly his elder cousin. Spock stood out among the throng of natural-colored robes, his Cadet uniform was like the sand of Vulcan itself.</p>\n<p>Senik watched him raptly, cataloging every difference, every unique mannerism, and subtle expression. Spock was exotic. He was interesting and independent and cultured in ways that Senik\u2019s peers were not. He embodied a future of possibilities that Senik was sure he was not to find on Vulcan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.7 years later, when Senik was nine and T\u2019Mae gave him a choice, it was surprisingly simple to make.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>There were many things to dislike about his life on Earth. The climate, especially in San Francisco, was damp and cold. The food was too sweet or poorly spiced. Compulsory education was entirely deficient. The water tasted of shale. The commissaries did not carry Vulcan toothpaste.</p>\n<p>Senik came to the conclusion that the only thing he truly liked about Earth was Humans. Unlike many of his fellow Vulcans (including his father), he found Humans to be fascinating. At their worst, they were cruel, to the point of madness. But at their best, they were ingenious, adaptable, and compassionate. And Cadet James Tiberius Kirk was, by every objective measure Senik could calculate, the summation of the best Humanity had to offer.</p>\n<p>Senik tried to keep that in mind while following Cadet Kirk across campus in the chilly evening air, twenty-four hours after the Restaurant Encounter. He was meters behind him, trying to keep pace with the Human in a manner that was both discreet but not \u201ccreepy\u201d as Kirk had stated. Senik had consulted a Terran Standard dictionary about the word and concluded that his faux pas was not that he had been observing Kirk, but that he had been too successful in being unseen. He would endeavor to be more obvious.</p>\n<p>Kirk was in the company of his Academy dormitory cohabitation partner, Doctor Leonard McCoy. Kirk and Dr. McCoy were heading to a drinking establishment on the edge of campus, a popular destination for recreation and socialization during school hours. Senik watched as Kirk held the door for McCoy to enter first. While Dr. McCoy entered, Kirk turned in Senik\u2019s direction and waved at Senik.</p>\n<p>Senik felt pleased that he had achieved one of his objectives. Kirk had seen him and was extending a common Terran gesture of greeting. This was the sign of affirmation he was looking for. Senik must be following the unspoken rules of observing humanoid behavior.</p>\n<p>Senik crossed the street to the establishment, unsure where Cadet Kirk and Dr. McCoy would have gone. He looked around the moderately busy pub to see Cadet Kirk and Dr. McCoy taking seats at a table in the corner. Senik stood, mentally weighing the benefits of the observation vantage point against being jostled by patrons. He made his choice and moved to sit at the deserted bar counter, where the mirrored backsplash allowed him to study his subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d a buxom blonde bartender cooed. \u201cWhat can I get you, sweetie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTea. Earl Grey. Hot,\u201d Senik said, tucking his feet under him, to better see over the counter. \u201cPlease.\u201d She smiled as if Senik had said something amusing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you waiting on someone?\u201d she asked, making no move to get his beverage.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo they know you are here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded. \u201cHe has indicated his awareness of my presence.\u201d The bartender smiled again. Peculiar. She left, allowing Senik to devote his attention to Cadet Kirk.</p>\n<p>He was slouched, one hand on a malted beverage, the other hand gesturing wildly while he spoke to Dr. McCoy. His shoulders were angled toward Dr. McCoy, but not parallel. The doctor was furtively looking toward the bar, his attention held by the blonde woman preparing Senik\u2019s tea. Kirk did not seem upset by Dr. McCoy\u2019s divided attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarl Grey tea,\u201d the bartender said, depositing the steaming cup in front of Senik. \u201cWhere are you from, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVulcan,\u201d he replied, grabbing the cup and sipping it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, long ways from home,\u201d she remarked. Senik looked at her quizzically. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to know that too,\u201d a familiar voice asked behind his head. Senik spun around on the barstool, almost eye level to Cadet Kirk, his companion Dr. McCoy standing next to him, darting nervous glances between Kirk, Senik, and the blonde bartender.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am continuing my observations,\u201d Senik replied. \u201cI interpreted your gesture as permission to resume per our understanding yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk\u2019s mouth opened once, then shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou waved at me,\u201d Senik explained.</p>\n<p>Kirk snorted. \u201cI <em> waved at you </em>to go away,\u201d Kirk hissed under his breath for only Senik to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had interpreted the hand motion to be one of greeting. I was attempting to adhere to your rule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk raised a hand to rub his brow in possible frustration. \u201cSorry about this, Christine,\u201d he said to the bartender.</p>\n<p>Christine smiled widely at Senik again, for no apparent reason. \u201cFriend of yours, Jimmy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, kinda,\u201d he said and turned to Dr. McCoy, \u201cI think Senik and I need to talk. D\u2019ya mind?\u201d Kirk tilted his head slightly to the bar, seemingly communicating something important in a nonverbal manner. The doctor merely nodded, his eyes darting over to Christine again, his pupils dilating and his breathing rate increasing twenty-three percent. There was an almost imperceptible flush at his cheeks and ears.</p>\n<p>Fascinating.</p>\n<p>Senik hopped off the barstool and retrieved his tea from the counter, following Cadet Kirk to the table in the corner. Dr. McCoy took the vacated seat, sidling up to the bar to engage Christine the bartender in conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long are you going to play at this?\u201d Cadet Kirk asked, taking his seat.</p>\n<p>Senik pondered the question. \u201cI am unsure what you mean. I am not engaging in recreational activities. I am observing your behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this another way,\u201d Kirk grumbled, and then sat up, hands folded on the table, fixing Senik with a steady gaze. \u201cThe parameters of your observations are unacceptable. I am busy socializing off campus for the first time in weeks, and cannot have a Vulcan child following me around to every bar in Sausalito. And aren\u2019t you supposed to be home? Where is Spock?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is currently engaged in training exercises in the zero gravity laboratory,\u201d Senik informed him. \u201cHe is skilled as both a tactician and scientist. He has aspirations to serve aboard a starship within the next year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow logical,\u201d Kirk replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would also find it logical that you return home. Immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNegative,\u201d Senik said, taking a sip of his tea. \u201cIt is logical to infer he supports my dedication to my studies as a fellow scientist. Spock is considered to be intelligent and well educated by both Human and Vulcan standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is,\u201d Kirk said, not arguing either point. Inside, Senik was deeply pleased. The cadet was quite obviously appreciative of Spock\u2019s skills and attributes, a very good sign for his hypothesis. However, a thought occurred to Senik that made him reevaluate the past two week\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, are you patronizing this establishment to obtain a mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Both of Kirk\u2019s eyebrows raised in astonishment. \u201cA mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy research on Human social conduct indicates that they often frequent establishments such as this one to meet potential mates.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are awfully preoccupied with my non-existent love life,\u201d Kirk replied. \u201cNo. No mate. I\u2019m here as Bones\u2019s wingman.\u201d He paused and went on to explain. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who helps the friend approach a... mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not understand,\u201d Senik said, eyeing the doctor, who was still sitting at the bar, this time watching Christine the bartender prepare a lime green concoction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s Christine Chapel, one of the nurses at Starfleet Medical. My friend finds her attractive but is uncomfortable approaching her. So on the nights that she works, I sometimes come down here with him, to give him a bit of social confidence to talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik watched Dr. McCoy accept the lime green drink and smile enthusiastically. As soon as Christine turned away, the doctor grimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does not like the drink she prepared,\u201d Senik reported. \u201cYet he drinks it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well you do silly things like that when you like someone.\u201d Senik turned back to Cadet Kirk, filing the factoid with the other data he had collected on Human courtship behavior.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they suited for each other?\u201d Senik asked.</p>\n<p>Kirk shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. Why the interest in dating? Do you have some Human kid you\u2019re interested in, looking for some love advice? Because I have to warn you, Bones should not be your guide in the romance department.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIllogical. I have a wife,\u201d he replied, missing the bewildered expression on Cadet Kirk\u2019s face. Senik watched as Christine Chapel leaned over the bar and whispered something in Dr. McCoy\u2019s ear, making him laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s going well,\u201d Kirk commented. Senik nodded, although not entirely sure what he was witnessing. \u201cTime for me to head out, although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll want to be studying in my room tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik did not understand what was inferred but decided that it was irrelevant. His subject was on the move to another area, which was not anticipated this evening. He thought quickly of possible solutions to this new development.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know of a suitable area for you to study,\u201d Senik said. The Human looked at him with a quizzical look. \u201cIt is within the science building. You would not be disturbed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk frowned. \u201cThe science building\u2019s closed by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik reached within his Vulcan robes and pulled out a chip watching Cadet Kirk\u2019s eyes alight with interest. \u201cNot to everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>The engineering room was in ruins. Most of the crew was dead, the ship heavily damaged, and the gravity plates were disabled, leaving two known survivors, Ue and Caldera, holding onto the wall as debris floated around them. They were attempting to make it to the escape pods, but the failing systems were ensuring that if they left engineering as it was, they would never make it to the escape pods before life support failed. Between the two of them, there was only one working gravity boot. Caldera was working to rewire her boots, and Ue was trying to comb through the ship\u2019s damaged systems, finding any power they could divert to life support. Suddenly, the hiss of gas filled the dim room.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlasma leak!\u201d Caldera shouted over the hiss of gas flooding into the engineering chamber. \u201cWe have support online for two minutes, max. I can\u2019t fix these damn boots <em> and </em> reset the coils.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ue\u2019s eyes darted between Caldera and her inoperable gravity boots. \u201cLeave them. Get to the coils, I\u2019ll buy us more time.\u201d Caldera nodded and swung herself toward a wall to push off toward the coil, but overshot her swing, scrambled against the wall, and started somersaulting in the air in slow motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d she swore. Ue echoed the sentiment.</p>\n<p>With nothing to push off of, she was dead in the water. Ue worked frantically at the panel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve pulled all I got!\u201d Ue called, careful to keep one arm holding onto the wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to try rerouting the power to the other panel, maybe it will reset the coils.\u201d</p>\n<p>Caldera flapped her arms uselessly. \u201cNo! It\u2019s going to--\u201d</p>\n<p>But Ue had already sent the power surge, causing a shower of sparks. Immediately the lights returned and the gravity resumed. Ue and Caldera fell to the ground with twin thuds.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, Cadets, you have ignited a plasma leak, causing the warp core explosion,\u201d a voice called over the simulator audio channel. The channel cut out and Captain Pike sighed heavily, turning away from the viewing screen in the instructor\u2019s observation room. \u201cThat, Commander, is what Humans call a clusterfuck.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spock nodded, unsure if he was meant to reply. Three runs through the zero gravity simulation and all cadets failed to demonstrate even the initial competencies of the exercise. He watched as Cadets Ue and Caldera stood slowly, taking their places among the other cadets in the simulation lab deck, the other exchanging sympathetic looks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe results are not favorable,\u201d Spock finally said. \u201cEither the parameters of the simulation are not appropriate or--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--We have a batch of seriously unprepared cadets that are unfit for next month\u2019s launch.\u201d Spock felt illogically displeased by Pike\u2019s assessment, however correct. Spock had been training these ten cadets specifically to serve the Enterprise on its maiden voyage. They had exceeded all the criteria on paper, but in practice could not juggle multiple demands under pressure.</p>\n<p>Spock turned when the door behind them swung open, revealing Cadet James Kirk. He was startled upon seeing Pike and Spock, taking a step back.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, wrong room,\u201d the cadet blurted, trying to turn around but another figure was blocking the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the observation room, Cadet Kirk,\u201d a familiar young voice corrected.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>occupied</em>,\u201d Kirk hissed. \u201c <em> Let\u2019s go. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of vacating, Senik stepped around Kirk and entered the room. \u201cTomasu Spock, Cadet Kirk voiced an interest in seeing this part of the science building.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim Kirk was able to hide his shock and embarrassment quickly behind a polite smile. \u201cCaptain Pike, a pleasure to see you, sir. Commander Spock, sorry to interrupt your busy evening again, just another miscommunication with Senik. I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d Kirk started to inch backward, but Senik did not move.</p>\n<p>Spock raised an eyebrow at his young cousin. \u201cI am surprised to see you, tomasu Senik. I inquire as to how you and Cadet Kirk gained access to the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a key,\u201d Senik replied simply.</p>\n<p>Spock thought back on the day, realizing he had not made use of his building key in many days. \u201cYou have taken my key?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Senik replied. Senik would not see this as an invasion of privacy or an infraction. As his guest and ward, he was permitted to anything in Spock\u2019s possession if it was logical for him to use it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not permitted in here at this time,\u201d Spock replied. Senik blinked, obviously surprised. \u201cStarfleet facilities are closed during certain hours,\u201d Spock reminded the young Vulcan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is illogical to bar access to the building during certain hours,\u201d Senik pointed out. \u201cThe building\u2019s purpose is for learning, which can occur at any hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Were Spock to indulge his Human side, he would have sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, as he had seen Captain Pike do on occasions such as this. Senik\u2019s application of Vulcan social norms to novel situations occasionally resulted in odd situations. During Senik\u2019s first and only attempt at a Terran school for children, he attempted to leave after twelve minutes, having completed the all work for the day, and refused to participate in group activities with the class. Senik and the school principal had engaged in a debate of interspecies pedagogy for over an hour before Spock arrived. That day, Spock withdrew him from the school and enrolled him in Academy courses.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease excuse my young cousin. He is unfamiliar with Starfleet protocol,\u201d Spock said to Pike.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Spock,\u201d Pike replied benevolently but then shot a sharp look at the Human. \u201cKirk, what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk pointed to the young Vulcan, \u201cI\u2019m with him, sir. He suggested a tour of restricted and dangerous corners of Starfleet Academy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not suggest anything dangerous,\u201d Senik replied, craning his head to look back at Kirk, who was almost to the door.</p>\n<p>Pike laughed, although Spock could not find anything amusing about the situation. It was interesting to note that Senik did not deny that it was his idea, confirming Spock\u2019s suspicion that Senik had been continuing his \u201cscience project\u201d on Cadet Kirk. He was unsure why the Human allowed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, cadet, you just volunteered to be our next guinea pig,\u201d Pike said, stepping forward to grab Kirk\u2019s shoulder and usher him to another door connected to the simulation lab hallway. \u201cCommander Spock, why don\u2019t you and Kirk go down there and show them how it\u2019s done?</p>\n<p>\u201cSir? Do what?\u201d Kirk asked, glancing back at Spock with a worried look. Spock followed silently behind the pair, leaving Senik alone in the observation room, despite his shared confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new zero grav simulation,\u201d Pike explained, hand tight on Kirk\u2019s shoulder as if he might bolt. \u201cYou\u2019re just the man for the job. Just follow Spock\u2019s lead, you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>He marched Kirk into the simulation lab, equipped as a fair representation of the engineering room of a constitution class starship, and turned to address the other cadets waiting on the observation platform. Spock silently gestured for Kirk to take his place on a yellow square on the floor next to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cCommander Spock and Cadet Kirk will be demonstrating how this simulation is supposed to run,\u201d Pike announced. The group looked down at their instructor and classmate with renewed interest. \u201cBe taking notes, I expect a full analysis tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock turned to Kirk. \u201cIn this simulation, the ship has been heavily damaged. You are familiar with zero gravity protocol?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, my first semester,\u201d Kirk said. Spock tilted his head, curious how a first-year was able to enroll in an advanced course reserved for third years. Kirk went on to explain. \u201cI took my classes out of order, trying to get them all in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope that you remember the basic principles,\u201d Spock replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sure, it\u2019s like riding a bike,\u201d Kirk replied, winking. Spock was unsure what exactly Kirk was trying to convey but felt an odd feeling settle between his heart and stomach.</p>\n<p>A few moments after Pike had left the lab, the room went dim, lights on red alert. The antigrav simulator started, mimicking gravity plate malfunction. Spock and Kirk started to float slowly to the ceiling. With the ease of practice, Spock grabbed Kirk\u2019s arm and they moved in tandem, pushing strategically against floating debris to the wall where a computer console and the emergency equipment were located. Jim grabbed a pair of boots and handed them to Spock, and Kirk grabbed his own, allowing Spock to wrap his hand around Kirk\u2019s arm as he pushed his feet through the boots. He pressed the buttons and frowned when only one boot activated. He looked up at Spock without comment and grabbed his arm to provide the same tether hold, unaware Spock knew both his boots would be defective, as part of the parameters of the simulation. Spock went along with the simulation, putting his boots on and trying to activate them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are only in possession of one function gravity boot,\u201d Spock reported. \u201cI suggest that we ascertain if there are any survivors in our immediate area.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk nodded, one hand secured to the wall, accessing the console. \u201cNo life signs in this section, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>An alarm sounded, indicating life support had been compromised. Kirk immediately started scanning the ship's systems. \u201cPower has been compromised, a plasma coil is misaligned, and we have less than two minutes of life support.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock\u2019s brows furrowed, knowing that someone had changed the parameters of the simulation. They should have at least four minutes, which would have been sufficient time to come to the rational conclusion that Spock had determined. The abbreviated time forced Spock to take control of the situation as part of the demonstration.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet, you are to make your way to the escape pod. I will track your progress from here and reroute power along your escape path.\u201d</p>\n<p>This was the solution. Two cadets in, one survivor out. Judging by Kirk\u2019s dark expression, the irony of the situation was not lost on him. \u201cYou\u2019ll die.\u201d <em> Like George Kirk. </em></p>\n<p>Spock nodded shortly. \u201cMy physiology will allow me to remain here longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kirk said, tapping on the console screen. \u201cIt\u2019s the aft coil,\u201d he reported. \u201cManually realign it, and we got seven more minutes, at least.\u201d Spock knew this, but also knew getting to the aft coil in less than two minutes was not possible. It was located between two large relay systems, only accessible from the Jeffries tube behind engineering. In the engineering room, a Human arm could reach through the gap, but couldn\u2019t touch the coil to realign it, which was dangerous and difficult to do without the proper instrumentation. It occurred to him that Kirk was disobeying his direct order, and the odds of success were not in their favor, but Spock saw Kirk's intense expression and felt compelled to comply.</p>\n<p>Kirk turned back to him. \u201cHold me,\u201d he commanded, holding out his arm. Spock couldn\u2019t help but glance at one of the surveillance cameras, hoping Pike knew what Kirk was trying to achieve. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he insisted, and Spock obligingly took Jim\u2019s arm to tether him and Jim ripped off his working gravity boot. Kirk then pushed himself upside down and grabbed Spock\u2019s ankle as an anchor as he ripped open part of the wall and fished out a cable used for the anti-gravity machine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not part of our simulation,\u201d Spock informed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I can touch it, it\u2019s part of the simulation,\u201d Kirk shot back. Which was correct. Technically.</p>\n<p>Kirk started to tie the cable onto the gravity boot and handed the end of the cable to Spock. \u201cHold on and don't let go.\u201d Kirk braced his feet against the wall and pushed off like a swimmer toward the aft plasma coil, gravity boot in hand, cable trailing behind him. He landed against the large relay system, near the gap where Spock could make out the simulated plasma coil in the dim light. With one hand anchored on a relay panel, the other hand with the gravity boot, he tossed the boot into the narrow gap.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt connected!\u201d Kirk called, and then, as if fishing, wrapped his hand around the cable and started to pull back at an angle. \u201cAlmost there!\u201d Spock watched as Kirk gave one more tug on the cord and then yelled, \u201cGot it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock mentally shook himself and turned back to the console. Kirk diverted the plasma leak and they had their seven minutes of life support. Spock looked back at Kirk, nodded, and they both made their way toward the door that would lead to the escape pods. Jim and Spock worked to manually open the door. Once open, they crossed the threshold, ending the simulation in less than three minutes. The lights returned to normal and gravity returned, both landed on their feet. Jim smiled widely, bright blue eyes glowing. Spock caught himself staring openly at the man, wondering why he was the object of such an expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell do you call that, Kirk?\u201d Pike\u2019s voice rang in the simulation lab.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirk turned to one of the cameras and shrugged. \u201cInspiration, opportunity, and dumb luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pike laughed for the second time tonight, and Spock was still not sure what the amusing element was. \u201cThat\u2019ll be one for the record books. The rest of you are dismissed.\u201d The cadets on the observation platform filed out, talking excitedly among themselves.</p>\n<p>Kirk turned to Spock, face slightly flushed with the excitement of the simulation. \u201cYou aren\u2019t mad I beat the test, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock shook his head. \u201cNot at all. Your performance was a satisfactory example of the basic and advanced principles that simulation was meant to test. Your solution was... inelegant yet effective,\u201d Spock said. It wasn\u2019t tacit approval, but Kirk beamed anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Kirk walked out of the simulation lab into the observation room where Pike and Senik, balanced on a chair over a control panel, were waiting.</p>\n<p>\u201cI found your solution most impressive, Cadet Kirk,\u201d Senik said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you alter the parameters of the simulation?\u201d Spock asked, eying the control panel beside his young cousin. Senik sat back in his seat, shaking his head solemnly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I did,\u201d Pike said, to Spock\u2019s surprise. \u201cYou both do better under pressure, and I wanted to leave an impression on that group out there. You did even better than I could have imagined.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly through a technicality,\u201d Spock pointed out. \u201cI will have to redesign the anti-gravity array so none of the components can be appropriated.\u201d Spock glanced over at Kirk who was grinning unrepentantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Vulcans loved technicalities,\u201d Kirk replied. Spock did not reply. Love was a strong word, but he had made his point in his Human way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou go ahead and take the kid home, Commander,\u201d Pike said. \u201cIt\u2019s his bedtime, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock hesitated, unsure how to best correct the captain\u2019s assumptions politely. Vulcan children neither had \u2018bedtimes\u2019 nor required supervision to return home safely. \u201cI am needed here, Captain. The simulation redesign and analysis of the other cadet\u2019s performances would be\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk can escort me,\u201d Senik said suddenly. Spock glanced over to the Human in question, who was clearly surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, Kirk,\u201d Pike said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Spock is going to keep me here another hour. Make sure the kid gets home safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it is no inconvenience to you, Cadet,\u201d Spock added. \u201cI would be most appreciative.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kirk shrugged and turned to Senik. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ve had enough excitement for one day.\u201d The young Vulcan leaped off his chair and took his place next to Kirk. Spock watched their retreating backs as they walked out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnusual choice for a babysitter,\u201d Pike commented, and Spock didn\u2019t bother to correct him. \u201cHow did Jim Kirk finally cross your path?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Fifty-seven minutes later, Spock stepped out of the transport and onto the walkway that led to his home. It was a modest ranch house in a quiet neighborhood on the corner of the Academy campus in Sausalito. Through the window he could see that a light was still on in the common area, indicating that Senik was still awake.</p>\n<p>When he keyed into the door, he was unsurprised to see that Senik was perched on a Terran-style armchair reading. He <em> was </em> surprised to see that Cadet Kirk was sprawled out on the couch, fast asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk does not regularly partake in the requisite six hours of sleep, and is unlikely to reach the Human biological phenomenon of the REM cycle for optimal rest,\u201d Senik remarked quietly in lieu of a greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe cannot sleep here,\u201d Spock said, matching Senik's soft tone, which would be undetectable to Human ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Senik countered. \u201cTo wake him now would result in a 17 percent decrease in sleep efficiency. His first appointment is our shared history class. I will ensure that his hygienic and nutritional needs are met before class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock considered the logic of this, as well as his indebtedness to the man for escorting Senik home. \u201cHe will not appreciate you observing him while he sleeps,\u201d Spock said. Senik nodded, inferring Spock\u2019s acceptance, and stood to take his reading to another room. Spock gestured Senik to stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish to know... are you unsatisfied here on Earth?\u201d Spock asked, unsure how his fully-Vulcan cousin would view the emotional question.</p>\n<p>Senik shook his head. \u201cMy needs are adequately met, tomasu.\u201d Spock felt relief at that, and Senik continued. \u201cTomasu, are you unsatisfied with your life on Earth? Would you return to Vulcan for a more fulfilling life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy needs are adequately met here, as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no family here,\u201d Senik pointed out. \u201cWill you return to Vulcan and find a bondmate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock shook his head. \u201cYou are young, and do not understand such things,\u201d Spock said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am telik,\u201d Senik reminded him as if that simple fact imparted a wealth of knowledge. \u201cWhile you are fam\u2019telsu, unbonded and vulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Vulnerable </em>was about as blunt as any Vulcan would be about the repercussions of Spock\u2019s single status. Even his own mother would not comment on the issue, which was as Spock would prefer it. He had no wish to discuss the sensitive issue with his young cousin. \u201cIt is of no matter to you,\u201d he said firmly.</p>\n<p>\"It is of great importance to me,\" Senik said, eyes wide. Spock softened at that and brushed a gentle hand across Senik's hair, an acceptable gesture of affection for a Vulcan child. \"The home you have provided me, in my mother's stead, is of great importance,\" the boy continued, ever logical.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what need or purpose does Cadet Kirk serve? I ask because I infer you have spent much of your leisure time watching or interacting with him,\u201d Spock asked, glancing over at Kirk's prone form, a few meters away from where they stood. \u201cIf you wish to observe humanoid behavior, a diversity of subjects would allow you to gain a more thorough knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI have observed many. As you may have noticed, Cadet Kirk is, by all standards that I am able to measure, a superior example.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that surprising pronouncement, Senik trotted to his sleeping quarters to resume reading, leaving Spock alone with the unconscious Human.</p>\n<p>He stood in the common area, considering what Senik had said. Of course, Spock knew exactly who Cadet James T. Kirk was before he found him at the restaurant table. Spock, and every other Academy graduate, who had studied the USS Kelvin, and knew the story of George Kirk and his heroism, saving his crew and newborn son. Even Spock, who eschewed gossip, knew young Kirk had enrolled in the Academy shortly before Spock graduated. As an instructor, he knew that Kirk was superior in his studies, and had heard his colleagues praise Kirk's intellect. Had heard the coy appreciation of his other, more physical, attributes as well. <em> Spock knew exactly who Cadet James T. Kirk was. </em></p>\n<p>To be confronted with the man in person, was another matter. To have him sleeping on Spock's couch, snoring softly, with an untouched cup of tea cooling on the coffee table, was also incongruous with the mental image Spock had developed.</p>\n<p>It was many minutes before Spock realized he had committed the same faux pas that he warned Senik against, so he turned away so as not to stare at James Kirk in his sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, it is 0600 hours,\u201d a voice called, sharply dragging Jim out of a dream. He opened his eyes to a half-lit, unfamiliar room. He was lying on a couch, a light blanket draped tucked around his body making him feel even warmer in the hot room. He started to kick off the blanket, aware he was still in his clothes, except for his shoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you obtained a sufficient amount of rest?\u201d Senik continued. Jim looked down to see the boy, dressed in his usual robes, standing near Jim\u2019s feet. Jim propped himself up on his elbows to look around the room. Memories of the evening before still played in his head. Jim was still trying to sort them in their proper places. After the simulation, he escorted Senik home, the boy convinced him to try a cup of Vulcan tea, and he fell asleep. He dreamt of the simulation, of Spock demanding that Jim leave him to die, being physically pushed toward the exit, and failing to grab the Vulcan in a desperate attempt to change his fate.</p>\n<p>It was especially jarring when he looked over to see the real Spock standing in the kitchen, dressed casually in a green tunic. He was filling something at the kitchen sink, ignoring Jim on the couch. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, voice still groggy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about crashing on your couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik blinked owlishly. \u201cAs no damage to the furniture was incurred, apologies are unnecessary. My cousin agreed that it was inefficient and illogical to wake you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim glanced back at where Spock was standing, his attention still fixated on his sink. Was he avoiding looking at Jim, or was he always so intense? Or both?</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thanks then,\u201d he said, mostly to Spock. Senik nodded and Spock did not respond. Jim waited for a beat before adding, \u201cI better get going, or I\u2019ll be late for class.\u201d He flung the blanket aside and started to get up. He caught Spock\u2019s fleeting glance up at him, but the Vulcan turned his back, carrying what looked like an odd teapot to a table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are to use the facilities here to ready yourself for the day,\u201d Senik said, eyes darting between Jim and his elder cousin. \u201cFood to break your fast will also be provided.\u201d Before Jim could object, Senik plowed on. \u201cIf you do not, I have calculated that you are 82.4 percent likely to be late to class, causing a disturbance to the education of both you and our classmates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim appraised the boy skeptically. \u201cHow do you know that? You couldn\u2019t possibly calculate the odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis statistics are sound,\u201d Spock said from the other side of the room, placing the teapot on what looked like an ornate Bunsen burner on the dining table. Jim looked at the Commander and shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thank you for your hospitality. Again.\u201d Spock nodded in acknowledgment, his attention now absorbed in fiddling with the fancy Bunsen burner.</p>\n<p>Senik marched off, leading Jim down a small hallway to a serviceable bathroom that had a stack of seven towels and a toothbrush.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will procure the appropriate garments,\u201d Senik assured him. Jim smiled wanly and mentally steeled himself for walking into class wearing Vulcan robes.</p>\n<p>As soon as Senik left, he jumped into the shower, surprised to find it was sonic, like on a starship, and not the standard Human water shower. Jim supposed this, as with the balmy indoor temperature, was a simple cultural difference. He made quick use of it, brushed his teeth with oddly flavored toothpaste (sandy and nutty flavored?), and was trying to tame his hair when Senik knocked softly at the door. He grabbed two of the many towels to tie around his waist and shoulders, guessing that he was expected to chastely cover himself in terry cloth.</p>\n<p>When he opened the door, he was surprised to see Spock standing outside with a hanger of clothes. Their eyes met and Jim felt a delicious energy hum beneath his skin. Yes,<em> that, </em> Jim thought. He felt it at the restaurant, and stronger in the simulation lab like a magnetic field was pulling him toward the other man.</p>\n<p>\u201cSenik wishes to know if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim smirked. \u201cYou mean he hasn\u2019t deduced them all yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has indicated that you have several,\u201d Spock replied. His lips tightened and eyes softened, which gave an almost imperceptible impression of an amused expression. \u201cHe has been banned from obtaining your personal medical records, so I am gathering this information in a more conventional manner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate the effort,\u201d Jim said, smiling ruefully. \u201cWell, I\u2019m mostly allergic to shellfish, strawberries, soy, all root vegetables from Talos, and peanuts. That should cover most of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock nodded and took a half step leave, and then turned back as if belatedly remembering what was in his hand and held the cadet uniform out awkwardly to Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will not fit properly,\u201d Spock said before Jim could say anything. \u201cBut it should be acceptable.\u201d Jim accepted the hanger, careful not to touch the other man\u2019s hands, and nodded gratefully. Spock stood half a moment longer and then turned on his heels back toward the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Jim closed the door, and held Spock\u2019s old uniform up to himself, pondering the exchange with a small smile.</p>\n<p>Who knew Vulcans were so adorable?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Indeed the uniform did not fit properly. Slightly too long in all areas, but everything buttoned properly. When he came back into the open living area Spock was standing over the stove leaning over a skillet. Senik stood to the side, observing Spock\u2019s technique intently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour clothes are adequate?\u201d Spock asked, then glanced up to verify that Jim would pass inspection. Jim felt a flush of warmth, probably not associated with the climate of the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cThanks again.\u201d Spock nodded without comment. \u201cCan I help with anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll has been addressed appropriately, with the exception of the eggs, as you see. I replicated them, unaware Humans did not usually consume them in their raw form,\u201d Senik informed Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Jim said.</p>\n<p>Spock gave him a politely dismissive look, a Vulcan shrug as it were, and transferred half the eggs to Jim\u2019s plate with precise and practiced movements. He then transferred the rest to his own plate and carried both to the table. Jim followed the two Vulcans to the table and took his seat between them. He was gratified to find coffee and not tea at his seat, unsurprisingly prepared the way he preferred. He had to admit that in this one instance, Senik\u2019s diligence to science had paid off for Jim.</p>\n<p>They began breakfast, Spock, and Jim with plates of scrambled eggs and fruit, and Senik with a bowl of clear broth. After a solid minute of silent eating, Senik turned to Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you require the stimulation of small talk?\u201d Senik asked.</p>\n<p>Jim openly stared at the boy. \u201cUh, no. But thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have endeavored to read more about Human social norms and pragmatics,\u201d Senik said. \u201cHumans desire to discuss trivial matters regarding weather, current events, and daily plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not much of a morning person,\u201d Jim said awkwardly. \u201cThe silence is okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded solemnly, but Jim got the impression that it was not the answer the boy was looking for. \u201c... unless you wanted to practice Terran small talk on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik\u2019s eyebrows raised in surprise, then he shook his head. \u201cPerhaps in this instance, I would observe.\u201d He glanced meaningfully at Spock, fork full of eggs hovering above his plate in surprise.</p>\n<p>Jim suspected that Spock wasn\u2019t keen on the idea, but didn\u2019t know a way to politely decline without it seeming like Jim wasn\u2019t interested. Because Jim was. Interested, that is. Interested in learning more about Spock.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Spock spoke first. \u201cDo you have a busy day today, Cadet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim nodded, schooling his face into a polite expression for Senik\u2019s scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday, so I have all my classes in the morning, followed by a long shift at the library.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo find your work in the library appealing?\u201d Spock asked. Jim noticed that Senik was absolutely still, adopting the same posture and expression he did while in their morning lecture.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt pays the bills,\u201d Jim said casually. \u201cI can study while I work, which has allowed me to fast-track through my Academy courses. I graduate in a few months.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Some do not share your diligence or efficiency,\" Spock remarked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'm convinced my destiny is out there in the stars. To wait and spend more time here just seems... illogical.\"</p>\n<p>Spock tilted his head, considering. \"Your performance in the lab would suggest that you are well suited for duty aboard a starship.\"</p>\n<p>Jim smiled at that. \"You don't think I was taking unnecessary chances?\"</p>\n<p>\"I think I am able to believe both of those statements simultaneously,\" Spock said, making Jim laugh.</p>\n<p>\"I don't deny it. What about you, what do you teach?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdvanced phonology.\u201d Jim was curious about what a linguistics instructor was doing in the zerograv simulation lab last night, but Spock continued. \u201cI will take my commission as the first officer aboard the Enterprise when the term ends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim perked up at that, very impressed. The Enterprise. Growing up in her shadow in Riverside, it was all he could see when he envisioned his future. \u201cThat\u2019s a fantastic ship,\u201d Jim said, not without a fair bit of envy. Before he could ask more, Senik interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, we must depart in the next two minutes, if we are to be punctual,\u201d Senik said, standing up to take his bowl to the recycler. Jim took his cup and plate, followed suit, and then turned to Spock who was still finishing his eggs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for the gracious hospitality of your house,\u201d Jim said in accented Vulcan.</p>\n<p>He looked up from his meal, his gaze unwavering. \u201c<em>Veling</em>,\u201d Spock replied. \"You are welcome.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jim smiled and followed Senik out the door and down the path to the public transport to campus. When they entered the lecture hall, Jim moved a couple of seats over from his usual spot and gestured for the boy to sit, still giving the boy a bubble of personal space.</p>\n<p>\"So I can observe you observing me,\" Jim explained. Senik did not comment or object.</p>\n<p>In addition to reading for his next class, his mind wandered to Lieutenant Commander Spock. There was some chemistry there, but Jim was uncertain if he was misreading the Vulcan. Regardless, he was already silently plotting how he could run into Spock again. He had to return the uniform, after all.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Jim caught shit from his roommate as soon as he walked in the door that evening.</p>\n<p>\"You sly dog,\" Bones said, punching him in the arm. \"I didn't even see you leave the bar, who'd you leave with?\"</p>\n<p>\"The annoying Vulcan child,\" Jim replied, smirking at the doctor's look. \"I just made sure the kid got home safe and crashed on a couch somewhere,\" Jim explained, not wanting to go into the whole story of <em>fell asleep on kid's couch, now wearing Vulcan Professor's old uniform that smells like him and I like it</em>.\u00a0 Bones' eyes narrowed but didn't ask any more questions.</p>\n<p>\"So, Christine?\" Jim asked, glad when the doctor's eyes got a little misty and distracted.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, she's great,\" Bones said. \"She's got third shift tonight at the hospital, so I'm bringing her breakfast tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>Jim batted his eyes and put on his best sappy pout. \"Oh, Leonard, why don't you ever make me breakfast?\"</p>\n<p>\"Breakfast is for people you actually like, idiot,\" Bones grumbled defensively.</p>\n<p>Jim thought back to a plate of scrambled eggs with a soft expression, to the doctor's unending annoyance.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Monday came and Jim found himself at his usual spot in the dining hall with Bones.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn around,\u201d Bones muttered, discretely covering his mouth with a napkin. \"Vulcan at your starboard quarter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim sighed. Senik really didn\u2019t know when to take a hint.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s still staring at you,\u201d Bones commented.</p>\n<p>Jim rolled his eyes and turned around, ready to chew Senik out for his behavior. He was brought up short when he met the intense gaze of Spock. His stomach did a funny flip as the Vulcan gestured to the empty seat at his table, apparently expecting Jim to join him. Spock searched Jim out. Why, he wasn't sure, but he was going to find out.</p>\n<p>Jim glanced back over at his roommate, who was wearing a disbelieving look. \"You make the oddest friends.\"</p>\n<p>Jim shrugged and stood to join Spock. \"It's my winning personality, I think.\" Bones rolled his eyes and stood to leave for his shift at the med facility.</p>\n<p>Jim approached Spock's table, energy humming beneath his skin. \u201cCadet Kirk,\u201d Spock said in greeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cCommander Spock,\u201d Jim replied just as formally and set his tray down and took the seat opposite him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is pleasing to see you,\u201d Spock said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to attempt small talk now, we aren't being watched,\u201d Jim assured him, a small smile that he was sure Spock returned with his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not mean it as a Human pleasantry,\u201d Spock replied honestly. Jim smiled wider, holding Spock\u2019s warm gaze. He knew he must look ridiculous, was positive Bones was making gagging noises across the dining hall, but he didn't really care.</p>\n<p>\"Well, it's good to see you too,\" Jim finally managed. \"I have your uniform for you, I wasn't sure how you wanted me to return it.\"</p>\n<p>That was a lie. Jim had the uniform for two days, cleaned, pressed and hung up in his closet. He was still mapping out the best way to return the garment to Spock while still ensuring that the exchange would extend into something more than just a simple drop-off.</p>\n<p>\"I will be in the Cochrane building tomorrow, 1800 hours,\" Spock suggested.</p>\n<p>\"I can bring it there,\" he said, slightly disappointed. There went his excuse to visit Spock at his home again.</p>\n<p>\"I am attending a lecture on computer science application for transwarp theory,\u201d Spock added.</p>\n<p>\"Dr. Dwega\u2019s, right?\u201d Jim asked. Spock nodded and Jim perked up. \u201cShe\u2019s working on some very interesting ideas that could really revolutionize Starfleet engineering.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock nodded in agreement. \u201cOn a ship as large as the Enterprise, her theories could improve system efficiency dramatically. I thought you would want to attend as my guest, given your interest in the Enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim was flattered that Spock remembered his interest in that ship in particular. \u201cThat would be great. Thank you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock hesitated, then continued. \"There is a restaurant across from the lecture hall if you would care to join me for dinner afterward.\"</p>\n<p>Jim processed the words for a moment. The last time he was asked to dinner by a Vulcan, he had misunderstood quite a bit. \u201cWould you characterize this dinner as platonic?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock shook his head carefully, searching Jim\u2019s face. \u201cIf my romantic advances are unwelcome, I apologize, and will desist immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim felt like telling Spock he could advance on him right here on the dining table and Jim wouldn\u2019t mind but didn\u2019t think Spock\u2019s Vulcan sensibilities would appreciate the innuendo.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean yes. Yes, dinner sounds good,\u201d Jim said, trying to tamp down his enthusiasm. \u201cIt all sounds great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock\u2019s lips tightened again, and Jim was now positive it was a smile.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the pair, a Vulcan boy with digital binoculars was waiting behind a recycler station, observing the entire exchange with relish.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Stardate 2257.216</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>1232 hours: Subject Kirk was observed conversing with Subject Spock at Starfleet Academy dining facility for 7.56 minutes.</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Subject Kirk demonstrated behavior consistent with Human characteristics of heightened arousal.

I have asked him to accompany me to a lecture and dinner this evening, as part of a Human courtship ritual.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik nodded and felt compelled to take a PADD out and make notes. This revelation supported his working hypothesis. New data would be gleaned from this development.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you experiencing anxiety related to this event?\u201d Senik asked, curious if Spock felt the Human emotion common in this situation. His reading referred to the emotion as \u201cjitters.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnxiety is illogical.\u201d This was not a \u201cno,\u201d Senik noted, but did not verbalize this realization.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI volunteer my services as your wingman,\u201d Senik said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am unfamiliar with the term.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have been informed by a reliable source that the presence of another can aid in achieving a level of emotional comfort needed for romantic social interaction to succeed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock was silent for a moment, scrutinizing Senik. \u201cUnnecessary,\u201d he replied shortly. \u201cYour support is appreciated. However, I must insist that you not interfere with or observe Cadet Kirk or myself this evening.\u201d Senik opened his mouth to give a logical protest, but Spock continued. \u201cThis is a private and personal matter, not under the purview of your humanoid observations.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik silently objected to that statement, but the most logical response was to simply nod in agreement. His pursuit of science would never be deterred so easily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>2023 hours: Have recruited an employee of the dining establishment to aid me. She has required an odd exchange for services, but as it is neither dangerous nor taxing, I have agreed.</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik was sequestered just outside the kitchen facilities of a French bistro, playing kal-toh with a waitress named Louisa. By day, she was a young cadet who had a fondness for the Vulcan board game and tonight was willing to allow a Vulcan child to wait in the prep station on the condition of playing a match and keeping quiet. The situation could not have been more serendipitous. Senik had calculated that this was one of four restaurants that met the criteria of serving vegetarian dishes, did not use peanut oil, and was within walking distance to the Cochrane building. This was the only one that had a waitress who was willing to relay information to Senik.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s a cute couple in my section, in the corner booth. One Vulcan, one Human, just like you said,\u201d Louisa reported to Senik, dropping her order off. \u201cThey ordered the spinach flatbread and two herbal teas.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik nodded his thanks, making notes on his PADD. \u201cWhen you serve them their drinks, make note of the Vulcan\u2019s nostrils.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis nostrils?\u201d she asked, eyebrows furrowed in confusion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Senik replied, moving another piece on the kal-toh board. \u201cIt will reveal important information to support my hypothesis. Also, any verbal exchange you might overhear would also aid me in my mission.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, your mission,\u201d she said dubiously, starting to prepare tea. Senik refrained from restating his objectives, ensuring she was aware, and repetition would not aid him. Any data, even second-hand from the untutored waitress-cum-cadet, was better than nothing. Louisa contemplated the board and moved a piece. Senik quickly made his next move and Louisa countered, grabbed the two tall mugs, and bustled out of the station.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two minutes later she walked into the kitchen and came out with Spock and Cadet Kirk\u2019s appetizer. She waited a moment, studying the kal-toh board.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis nostrils were flaring,\u201d she said, reaching over to move another piece. \u201cDoes that mean something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Senik said, making another note on his PADD, and didn\u2019t elaborate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Louisa returned to send up her order of mushroom and tomato crepes and asparagus quiche.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Human guy is trying to tell jokes,\u201d she reported, rolling her eyes. Evidently, even most Humans knew better than to attempt the practice of verbal humor with Vulcans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik made a few notes but did not comment. This did not bode well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Seventeen moves later, the waitress left with a single dessert, assuredly for Cadet Kirk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo Vulcans eat refined sugar?\u201d she asked when she returned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is not something regularly eaten in a traditional Vulcan diet,\u201d Senik acknowledged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat's what I thought. Well, your Vulcan doesn\u2019t seem to mind splitting the chocolate cake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChocolate cake?\u201d Senik repeated, most illogically. \u201cHe would not eat chocolate cake.\u201d To ingest such a food would result in an impairment of the nervous system, including complex cognitive functions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, he\u2019s practically eating it out of his date\u2019s hand,\u201d Louisa muttered, peering through the small window of the door leading to the dining room. Senik stood up on tiptoe to observe for himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Louisa had said, Spock and Cadet Kirk were sitting in the corner of the restaurant, Kirk holding out a forkful of cake to Spock. Senik\u2019s eyes widened as Spock put his hand on the fork, touching Kirk\u2019s, and guided it to his mouth. Senik could feel the heat of his blood suffuse his cheeks with verdant hues. Such a private act was not meant to be observed by others, let alone in a public place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shocking and scandalous were words that came to mind, words that his people would use to describe the scene that unfolded in front of his eyes. However, the scientist in him also noted the empirical data. Spock was touching his face, running a finger across his cheek as if being thoughtful. His eyes were unwavering from Kirk\u2019s, his other hand brushing against the Human\u2019s once more before returning to his drink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite much evidence supporting adherence to the traditional Vulcan lifestyle, Spock was also quite Human in his mannerisms. Senik postulated that Spock was quite unaware of this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Louisa barked from the kal-toh board. \u201cMake a move, I don\u2019t have all night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik trudged back to the table, moved another kal-toh piece, and added his newest data into the PADD.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>2257.219</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>1600: Observed Subject Spock enter the living area of the household wearing a brown tunic, as is customary on Thursday evenings.

What did you do together before you got married?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik thought back to when he met the girl who became his bonded. \u201cWe have a traditional Vulcan bonding. We met at </span>\n<em>\n<span>koon-ut</span>\n</em>\n<span>, the appointed place. To what pre-bonding activities are you referring?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know, dates,\u201d Kirk asked. \u201cTalking, getting to know the other person. Everything before the bonding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVulcans do not engage in pre-bonding activities. As telepathic beings, we are able to determine appropriate and logical pair-mates at a young age.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you had an arranged marriage?\u201d Senik nodded. Kirk seemed to contemplate this for a moment. \u201cSo Spock\u2026\u201d his voice trailed off, his sentence incomplete. Senik stared at him blankly, unsure why the cadet had not finished his message.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim rallied and voiced the rest of his thoughts. \u201cSo has Spock dated before? Ever?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am unaware of any previous attempts of courtship in any culture,\u201d Senik verified. Figuring, as the Human saying goes, turnabout was fair play, he posed his question. \u201cIs he meeting the Terran expectations of your social agreement?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim\u2019s eyes widened in alarm. \u201cYou know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKnow of what, Cadet Kirk?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpock and I and our\u2026 dating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I have observed behavior that would indicate this change in your social behavior, and have received verbal confirmation from my cousin. How would you rate his behavior in the understood standards of Human wooing? I ask, for the sake of scientific inquiry, that you be precise and descriptive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kirk appeared to be temporarily rendered unable to speak, making an unusual rasping noise. When his typical countenance returned, he was smiling for unknown reasons. \u201cHe\u2019s a perfect gentleman. Very\u2026 reserved,\u201d Kirk supplied.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik nodded in approval. \u201cA sign of respect and courtesy for Vulcans,\u201d he added. Unlike himself, Cadet Kirk was sure not to have time to engage in an in-depth study of Vulcan social customs. Perhaps Senik could appraise him of the basics.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cI thought it was me. Maybe he didn\u2019t like my cologne.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCologne?\u201d Senik asked, unfamiliar with the Standard word.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHumans wear it sometimes to smell good to others,\u201d Cadet Kirk explained. Senik made the connection between the concept and the artificial scents some beings used.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVulcans possess a keen sense of smell,\u201d Senik explained. \u201cThe chemicals the Humanoids use here are offensive to our sensory processing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Kirk glanced around the rapidly filling room. \u201cHow do you stand it here, then? With so many people and so much to process?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVulcans possess vastly superior mental faculties, and we are trained at a young age to withstand such overwhelming sensory input.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kirk nodded and turned back to reading his PADD. He muttered under his breath, surely not intending Senik\u2019s vastly superior auditory sense to pick up what he said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cNow I just need to overwhelm a Vulcan with my own sensory input.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Stardate 2257.220</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>1912: My ethical dilemma continues.</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was Saturday, according to the Terran Standard calendar. Spock was to accompany Cadet Kirk to the holoplex to view a remastered Human classic video drama. Senik contemplated writing a message to his mother to request to remain on Earth for another semester. He had an interest in xenobiology, and the courses at the Academy were, admittedly, far superior to those that could be found on Vulcan. He realized how vast and varied Starfleet's amassed knowledge was, gained through interspecies cooperation. Senik contemplated a possible future in which he could pursue science with Starfleet, much like Spock. He shared this thought with his cousin before he left for his \"date.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI infer that your humanoid behavior observations have inspired you to take an interest in Starfleet and the Federation,\u201d Spock said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik gave a small nod, almost tentative. \u201cDo you think ko-mekh will approve?\u201d Senik asked. He had not shared his interest with his mother. While she had never disapproved of Spock\u2019s decision, she could arrive at a different conclusion when these variables included her son.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock considered the question. \u201cI do not believe your mother would condemn your pursuit of knowledge. She is a scientist, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you approve?\u201d Senik asked a moment before he could properly analyze the question. Yes, he was seeking Spock\u2019s approval. While not logical, it was a beneficial variable in his life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSenik, whatever you decide, I will always be proud of you,\u201d Spock said solemnly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik allowed himself to bask in the surprising emotional warmth generated by the statement. In a fit of creative inspiration, he took out his reading PADD and extended it to Spock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have downloaded many fictional and non-fictional texts written by Humans about Starfleet,\u201d Senik said. Spock took the extended device. \u201cPerhaps you would avail yourself of this information, to better understand Cadet Kirk. There is an entire section related to courtship and Human romance.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock scanned the screen, finding the appropriate section of titles.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span> Star-Crossed Prime Directive Love Connections</span>\n</em>\n<span>, </span>\n<em>\n<span>The Vulcan Captain and the Virgin Yeoman, </span>\n</em>\n<span>\" Spock read aloud and then looked down sharply. \"I do not think that these cultural texts are relevant to my relationship with Cadet Kirk. Nor should you be using them as a template for typical Humanoid behavior.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik nodded. \u201cI have since inferred this,\u201d he admitted. \u201cHowever, they still serve as important artifacts of Terran culture.\u201d Spock nodded, turned the screen off, and left to change into casual attire.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik watched Spock leave the room with the reading device, unsure if he had contaminated his project\u2019s data irrevocably. The reading PADD would be returned two weeks later.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>2257.222</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>1310 hours: Subjects Spock and Kirk engaged in conversation outside the officer's lounge. Subject Kirk's demeanor is characterized as animated--</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing, </span>\n<em>\n<span>H\u2019gorth </span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d a deep voice snarled, the Andorian slur heavy in the air. Senik turned around to find the first-year cadet that had tripped on his bag many weeks ago in his history class. The Andorian male was leaning over him menacingly, teeth bared in a predatory manner.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am conducting scientific observations,\u201d Senik stated, unaware of what he had done to anger this man yet again. \u201cIt does not involve you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With strength and reflexes that rivaled Senik's own, the Andorian snatched the PADD out of Senik\u2019s grasp. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he muttered, scanning the files.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReturn my property,\u201d Senik commanded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Andorian ignored him. \u201cSubject Kirk? You\u2019re spying on Jim Kirk?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am not spying,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am conducting--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re being </span>\n<em>\n<span>a we\u2019Kweleth, H\u2019gorth</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d the Andorian said, taking a step toward Senik waving the data PADD menacingly. In a tactical defensive blunder, Senik found his back against a wall. \u201cI ought to turn this into \u2018Fleet security.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik felt a surge of desperation and anger, quite unbecoming of a boy his age. Weeks of observations to be confiscated by unlearned security personnel, it was almost too much to bear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would be illogical to take threats seriously from a man whose father\u2019s shadow walks over a neighbor\u2019s field,\u201d Senik said firmly, completely aware of how base a slur he spoke to the Andorian. Shameful, but necessary in his mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unfortunately, Senik was slightly less cognizant of how fast and hard an Andorian fist could move toward his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock arrived seven minutes early for Dr. Dwega\u2019s lecture. He stood outside in a hallway with his back to a wall, providing him an excellent vantage point of both doors. He waited outside the entrance of the lecture hall for 1.43 minutes before Cadet Kirk pushed through the main double doors, dressed smartly in a gray linen shirt and slacks. Spock watched silently as the other scanned the small crowd that had gathered. When the bright blue eyes found Spock, Kirk broke into a tight-lipped smile and walked directly toward him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Hello, Coman- Spock,\" he said, almost tentatively.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is pleasurable to see you again, James,\u201d Spock said, the man\u2019s name odd on his tongue. The other man smiled widely this time, seemingly more at ease. Spock was gratified to see that they had both opted out of Starfleet uniform, certain that they both wanted as little as possible to remind them of their current perceived imbalance of power.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s just Jim,\u201d the man corrected. \u201cJames always sounds so\u2026 serious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock considered reminding Jim that this was a serious event, and he did not initiate a romantic relationship lightly but decided to set that aside for now. \u201cJim,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cShall we take our seats?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock led Jim into the lecture hall and was gratified to see that the most optimal seats for viewing were available. Jim stared at the empty first row and took a seat in the middle. Spock took the seat next to him. He could not help but notice that there were 27.84 centimeters between their knees and only 9.3 between their respective elbows. He could feel the heat radiating from the other man as well as a Terran fragrance, laundry soap, and mint all masking a more earthen natural scent.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim leaned over toward Spock, his mouth unnecessarily near to Spock\u2019s ear. \u201cSome of the professors are staring at us. I hope that isn\u2019t a problem for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock looked over to Jim, met his eyes, and was able to detect the fascinating pigmentation of the iris against the lack of pigment in the stroma of the iris.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs it?\u201d Jim asked again. The lights started to dim and Spock broke eye contact.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Spock said finally. \u201cYour opinion is the only one that is relevant in this matter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When a petite woman took the stage, Jim\u2019s elbow had moved 3.25 centimeters closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>---</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim kept pace in the cool night air, his arms swinging casually back and forth, as they walked toward the small bistro Spock had selected for their dinner. His gait was relaxed, his head turned, and his attention centered mostly on Spock and not anything in their path, leaving Spock responsible for navigating them to their destination safely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEven in smaller vessels, it could be applicable. Some of those older ships have so many redundant systems. Reduce that and a runabout, and suddenly, you\u2019ve got\u2026\u201d Jim slapped his hand together and made a complicated gesture. \u201cIt would be very efficient,\u201d Jim clarified as they approached the door of Frontiere de L\u2019infini.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock said, holding the door open for his Human date. Jim gave him a smile for the small gesture, and Spock was silently grateful his mother had taught him a few customs from her culture. As the host led them to a quiet corner, he allowed Jim to take his seat first. They ordered their drinks and Spock answered irrelevant questions about his childhood and family. An appetizer arrived, and the conversation turned to courses Jim had taken.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2026and then he has the nerve to bring up some outdated postulate on transwarp theory that probably predates Vulcan warp capability, if that gives you an idea of how out of line he was. So this other guy leans over and says in this really thick Scottish accent-- I have no idea where this guy came from-- \u2018Cannae ye see we\u2019re not Byrean nor Qielian in this dimension?\u2019\u201d Jim guffawed loudly at his own story. Spock nodded his acknowledgment of the subtle play on words but was ultimately puzzled by the humor of the anecdote, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother his Human companion. Jim finally sobered when the waitress came to refill their drinks, and then the rest of dinner was continued in a comfortable conversation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock was not naturally one for \u201csmall talk\u201d but, like Senik, (and he was trying not to think of his young ward) he was aware of most Human\u2019s needs to fill the moment with constant chatter. Jim occasionally asked a question or shared an anecdote, but also seemed equally content to sit in silence, a decidedly rare characteristic among many Humans, and Spock was appreciative of this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019re your crepes?\u201d Jim asked halfway into their second course.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNutritious and appropriately prepared,\u201d Spock replied. \u201cAnd your entree, is it adequate?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, it\u2019s delicious,\u201d he said, swallowing a bite. \u201cDo you have a favorite food, or is taste unimportant to Vulcans?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe have preferences. It is logical that sensory pleasure is one of many measurable factors that would determine preference. For example, I prefer Terran mushrooms to the native edible fungus of Vulcan,\u201d and took another bite of the mushroom and tomato crepe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about in people? Do you have a preference for sentient life forms?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock chewed, considering the question, realizing that Jim perhaps was asking a question of a more relevant and personal nature.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI prefer intelligence and integrity over any genetic composition,\u201d Spock said. He also suspected he had a preference for the yellow coloring of Jim\u2019s hair but didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to voice it just then. Jim looked like he was about to respond when the waitress bustled up to the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould you care for dessert? Our house specialty is our flourless chocolate cake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will take black coffee,\u201d Spock said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t say no to chocolate cake,\u201d Jim said. She nodded and left their table. Jim suddenly frowned when she left the room. \u201cShe\u2019s been staring at you like she\u2019s evaluating your facial expressions,\u201d he muttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did not notice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s weird, like that look your cousin gets when I\u2019m doing something new, and he has to document it.\u201d Then Jim shrugged, and the subject was dropped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The waitress came back and set the coffee and a large slice of rich chocolate cake on the table. Jim licked his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s got raspberries and whipped cream,\u201d Jim sighed, grabbing the fork and immediately taking a bite and groaning. \u201cThis really is amazing. Want to try a bite?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock stared at the offered bite of chocolate cake on the fork. The sharing of utensils was incredibly intimate and somewhat taboo in Vulcan culture. Spock was only half aware of his actions until his hand closed over the fork, brushing against Jim\u2019s. He closed his mouth over the fork, able to detect the cocoa, the freshness of the eggs used, the metal of the fork, and a taste of something that surely must be Jim. The realization was titillating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s good?\u201d Jim asked, hand still on the fork. The barest of contact between Spock\u2019s ring finger and Jim\u2019s index sent him Jim\u2019s muted wave of\u2026</span>\n<em>\n<span> interest.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock swallowed, unsure of how to categorize the experience, but nodded and released the fork.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnother bite?\u201d Jim asked, a smile blooming on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI should not indulge,\u201d Spock said. \u201cProcessed sugar has a negative impact on my physiology. Much like ethyl alcohol is to Human physiology.\u201d Jim nodded, then widened his eyes in comprehension.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo when I was offering my soda to Senik when we first met at that restaurant by the library, it could have gotten him drunk?\u201d Spock nodded. \u201cNow I can see where you thought I was involved in the delinquency of a minor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock shook his head. \u201cSenik is entirely too inquisitive for his own good. As he matures, he will find a balance between his curiosity and good prudence.\u201d Spock paused, considering. \"I have since changed my opinion of your character considerably. I may have to thank Senik for it.\" Spock was rewarded with a chuckle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim finished the rest of his cake, a few appreciative groans that were probably entirely unnecessary, and the pair stood to leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will escort you to your dormitory,\u201d Spock said, swiping a credit chip over their table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim merely smiled and nodded. During their walk, Spock calculated that Jim walked between 4\u20136 centimeters closer on the way to his dormitory than when they walked to the restaurant. Jim hummed a little in the companionable silence as he led Spock down a familiar path to one of the dormitories.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, this is me,\u201d Jim said, stopping at the door, rocking on the balls of his feet. \u201cI had a good time tonight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have had an enjoyable evening in your company as well. I will comm you tomorrow if you would like assistance on your Exochemistry project,\" Spock promised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat sounds great. Well\u2026\u201d Jim rocked again, an intent look on his face. Spock now recognized the expression that Jim was referring to in the restaurant, Jim was studying him, trying to find... something. Jim must have found it, as he gave a short sigh and smiled. \u201cGoodnight, Spock.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGoodnight, Jim,\u201d Spock murmured and remained on the sidewalk and watched the man enter his building. From his vantage point in the shadows, he could see Jim\u2019s wide grin as he walked past a window and up the stairs to his room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Several days later\u2026.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u2026 her sensuous curves quivered under his skilled and rugged hands.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cCaptain,\u201d he husked out. He was the Yeoman, his attention to detail was paramount to pleasing the logical captain of his illogical heart and soul. His Vulcan captain smiled as his fingers dipped deeper, her moist passion spilled out onto the captain\u2019s chair and\u2026</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock abruptly set Senik's PADD down. He was unsure of what he objected to more, the </span>\n<em>\n<span>moist passion </span>\n</em>\n<span>or the </span>\n<em>\n<span>smiling Vulcan</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Was this what Humans expected from Vulcan lovers? Was this what Jim expected?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He thought on that for a while, all the way to the holoplex where Jim was waiting, popcorn and drinks ready. Jim was insistent that helping him study for Exochemistry was not a date, and neither were their frequent but brief comm's over the past week. He claimed it was a traditional Human dating ritual, so for the first time, Spock found himself led down a dim hall through the throng of holomovie patrons.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis was a Terran masterpiece from centuries ago. It\u2019s been remastered so many times, no one is quite sure what the original was like, and I've never seen it in 5D with the extended director's cut,\u201d Jim said, as they took their seats in the half-filled room. He handed Spock not one but two drinks. \u201cDidn\u2019t know what you\u2019d like, so I brought choices.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock inspected the unsweetened chai and took a tentative sip. \u201cThank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim grinned and sat back in his seat, opening boxes of candy. \u201cI know you say you don\u2019t normally indulge, but I figure it\u2019s Saturday and you might want to try some Human candy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock wondered why the Terran designation of this particular day on the Standard calendar would influence his behavior, but took an offered piece from a purple box and sampled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock must have given some unknown facial expression because Jim had to smother a rueful grin. \u201cI take that you aren\u2019t a fan of raisins?\u201d Spock shook his head and swallowed the offending Raisinette. Before he could object, Jim held out a handful of different chocolate-covered candies. \u201cTry these instead. I have a good feeling about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock took one, fingertips brushing against Jim\u2019s palm, a spark of </span>\n<em>\n<span>interest</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Jim flushed slightly in the dim light of the holotheater. Spock chewed tentatively, more interested in Jim\u2019s pigment change. What did it feel like to Jim when their hands met? Was Jim aware of what the gesture might mean to a Vulcan?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe mint flavoring is quite enjoyable,\u201d Spock reported. Jim smiled triumphantly and handed Spock the box.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When the movie concluded, the triumphant heroes were rewarded by the princess, Jim's finger was tracing the top of Spock's hand, and Spock had eaten an entire box of mint-flavored candy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe villain is still alive,\u201d Spock pointed out as the lights came on and they walked to the exit. \u201cAnd they have only succeeded in winning a minor battle against a rather well-supplied military regime.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s a sequel,\u201d Jim explained. \u201cActually, nine sequels. And three prequels, but we won\u2019t talk about those.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock could only nod. \u201cI\u2019d look forward to seeing the next one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim gave Spock a half grin. \u201cYou just used a contraction.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock paused and thought back on his previous words. \u201cYes. I have eaten the entire box of these Junior Mints, and my cognition and fine motor skills are mildly impaired.\u201d In confirmation of that statement, Spock attempted to place his empty candy container in the recycler near the door and needed two tries to succeed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cYou\u2019re a lightweight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am uncertain what you mean by that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt means I\u2019m taking you home,\u201d Jim said. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock frowned and then was belatedly surprised that he had made the expression. \u201cMy gross motor skills are mostly intact. I am able to see myself safely home, Jim.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel right. Anyway, you said yourself that your cognition is impaired, so I\u2019m making this decision in the interest of safety. I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As he couldn\u2019t argue with the logic of that decision, Spock followed Jim out of the crowded holoplex to the parking garage, where Jim stopped in front of a motorbike.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock balked at the two-wheeled contraption. \u201cI do not see how this option is safer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim smiled and handed Spock a helmet. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in an accident. I promise to be extra careful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock frowned again. \u201cOne should take the most amount of care when operating any vehicle, especially one with substandard safety features.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim chuckled as he strapped his helmet on, and then reached up to help Spock thread the straps of his own. Jim\u2019s face was close, he could smell a faint whiff of salted popcorn on his breath. Spock felt a sudden urge to find out what it tasted like on Jim.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAll set,\u201d Jim murmured, looking up at Spock with a small grin. He turned and swung a leg around the bike. \u201cJump on and put your arms around me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock took his seat and threaded his arms around Jim and held on as the lights of Sausalito sped past in his peripheral vision. It was a most dizzying sensation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>---</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they arrived at the quiet street of Spock\u2019s home, he stood and tried to disengage the complicated harness system of the helmet. Before he realized it, Jim\u2019s fingers were at his chin, batting away Spock\u2019s clumsy hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRemind me, no candy on the next date or you\u2019ll never want to go out with me again,\u201d Jim muttered, untangling the straps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Spock said. \u201cI will wish to continue our courtship.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that what we are doing by Vulcan standards? Courting?\u201d Jim asked. The straps unfastened and Jim gently ran his fingertips against his jaw and neck for a scant moment, and then they were back at the man\u2019s sides. Spock stood, staring at Jim, helmet still on his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is what we wish to make it,\u201d Spock replied seriously. \u201cMy interest in you has only increased in intensity.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim smiled ruefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the point in playing around, do you?\u201d Spock tilted his head, confused. Jim just shook his head. \u201cI always know where I stand with you. It\u2019s refreshing, that\u2019s all. A good thing.\u201d Jim reached up as if to touch Spock\u2019s face, but merely lifted the helmet from his head. \u201cI feel the same, by the way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim escorted Spock to his door, unsurprised that Senik was watchfully waiting from the window, and bid them both goodnight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Senik peered thoughtfully at Spock, standing in the middle of the communal room with no purpose. Spock looked back at him. \u201cUnless you require anything, I must retire for the evening.\u201d Without waiting for a reply, Spock turned and retreated to his room. He read through two chapters of \u201cThe Vulcan Captain and the Virgin Yeoman\" with disgust and disbelief before he was overcome by the processed sugar in his system and fell asleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning, Spock awoke at 0517, seventeen minutes later than was typical. He was otherwise completely refreshed. However, he spent seventeen fewer minutes meditating, which should not have had a significant impact on his day. Nevertheless, found himself mentally occupied by thoughts of Cadet Kirk all morning. The blonde, blue-eyed male was illogical and irrational and very, very Human. He was intelligent, inquisitive, and had certain indefinable qualities that drew Spock in and held him. More than simple charisma, he was magnetism personified.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>James T. Kirk was, quite possibly, everything a Vulcan mate was not. As Spock endeavored to be honest himself, all of this made Jim all the more attractive.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As if summoned by thought itself, Jim appeared at his elbow in the hallway. \u201cCommander, do you have a moment?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have a meeting with Captain Pike in twenty-two minutes,\u201d Spock said, tucking his hands behind his back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can talk fast, I have to get to work soon anyway,\u201d Jim insisted. Spock nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI got a message from Captain Cho this morning,\u201d Jim said, rubbing his hands together nervously. \u201cI\u2019m to report to her CO tomorrow for a preliminary meeting. Do you know what this means?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock blinked, making the mental connection. Captain Cho of the USS Shenandoah wanted Cadet Kirk, who was mere months away from graduating with honors, to meet with her first officer before official commissions were granted. There was only one conclusion to draw.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wanted to know what you thought I should do,\u201d Jim asked, his voice low. \u201cI mean, the Shenandoah is a great ship, but\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>But it was not the Enterprise</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Spock thought. It was slated for short-range missions in the Alpha quadrant, while the Enterprise\u2019s five-year mission was headed for deep exploration of the Beta quadrant. Jim may spend his entire commission, never crossing paths with the Enterprise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Shenandoah would be an excellent opportunity for any cadet looking to obtain various experiences,\u201d Spock said slowly. \u201cAfter the two-year commission, an ensign might be promoted to lieutenant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim stared at Spock\u2019s sleeve momentarily then steeled his jaw and met Spock\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat if\u2026 what if I\u2019m looking for a bigger commitment?\u201d Jim asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spock wondered at the possible double meaning, or if it was just hopeful on his part so soon. He looked away, contemplating his response, when his eyes landed on an Andorian leaning over the small thin frame of a familiar figure, holding a PADD above his head. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Senik</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Spock started to walk, then run when the Andorian\u2019s fist was pulled back. Spock sprinted down the corridor just in time to misdirect the arm and propel the man\u2019s fist into the wall, inches away from Senik\u2019s head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Andorian cried out in pain, holding his fist, and Senik darted out of the way as Spock grabbed the aggressor by the arm.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jim asked, two steps behind Spock. No one responded. A pair of cadets further down the hall were talking in their communicators, probably alerting security.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSenik, are you unharmed?\u201d Spock queried. Senik nodded, and the Andorian struggled futilely in Spock\u2019s grasp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid, Skeral,\u201d Jim said, his voice appalled. \u201cWhat is your problem with him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Andorian\u2019s antennae quivered and raised as Jim addressed him, but Skeral did not answer. Spock watched, wary of the Andorian\u2019s behavior toward Jim. Senik leaned down to pick up the discarded PADD. \u201cMay I be excused?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes. Cadet Kirk, you are dismissed. We will resume our discussion at a later point.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jim looked about to protest, but nodded and turned to leave. Spock turned his attention to the Andorian in his custody, who was eyeing Jim hungrily. As soon as Jim was out of eyesight, Spock turned to the Andorian, unsurprised to see the man's teeth bared in territorial defiance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are to not speak, engage, or interact in any manner with either the Vulcan boy Senik or Cadet Kirk,\u201d Spock commanded softly. \u201cIs that understood?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Although there were no witnesses, any security staff would report Cadet Skeral\u2019s response to Commander Spock necessitated the administration of defensive neutralization. Although never mentioned in the incident report, perhaps it was a little overzealous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Only an hour after the incident in the hallway, Jim was sitting at the computer console in the Astrometrics Processing Lab Help Desk trying to read through another dissertation on interstellar solidarity movements of the Beta Quadrant.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you are watching me,\u201d Jim said to the empty room, unsurprised when a head peeked out from behind a shelf. \u201cSenik, I thought we had a deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur agreement was that I obtain permission to observe you. That has already been obtained, and I was not made aware of any necessity to renew said permission,\u201d Senik said, still standing near the shelf several meters away. \u201cIn either case, I have not been conducting scientific observations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim waited silently, watching in fascination as Senik wrestled internally with something. He walked toward Jim\u2019s desk and handed him a PADD.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have made a separate agreement with Spock. I was to be transparent in my efforts, until the time that it would interfere with the objective nature of my observations,\u201d Senik said. \u201cI see now that my role as a scientist has become compromised, and it is only logical to end my study.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim took the offered PADD, recognizing it as the one that Skeral had grabbed from Senik an hour earlier. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy research and observations of the last five weeks. It is unfit to publish,\u201d Senik admitted, a trifle woeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why give it to me?\u201d Jim asked, simultaneously wary and intrigued by the imagined contents of Senik\u2019s study.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hypothesis was sound, as evidenced by my data,\u201d Senik said earnestly. \u201cI believe this study may be of value to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to accept a commission on the Shenandoah?\u201d Senik countered.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a big decision,\u201d Jim said, deciding not to question how the young Vulcan knew about the potential offer from Captain Cho.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you will want all the data available to make the most logical decision,\u201d Senik said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be all about logic and data, Senik. It\u2019s about what I want for me, for my career-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c- and the people you care about,\u201d Senik added.</p>\n<p>Jim blinked, surprised by the Vulcan boy\u2019s insightful answer. \u201cYes. That too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded and raised his hand in ta\u2019al. \u201cPeace and long life, Cadet Kirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim raised his hand in a passable salute in return. \u201cLive long and prosper.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>No less than thirty minutes later, while Jim was intently reviewing the words on his screen, the prickling sixth sense of being observed returned. He looked up, surprised to find Spock standing at his desk, hands clasped tightly behind his back, expression blank.</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize for interrupting your studies,\u201d Spock said, void of any trace of emotion.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not studying. Senik was here, he wanted me to read his research paper,\u201d Jim said, pushing the PADD away. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am well,\u201d Spock said, but his posture said otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Skeral\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is under review by Academy security and will be appropriately disciplined,\u201d Spock said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to know-\u201d</p>\n<p>They both stopped and Jim nodded at Spock. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to know if you are having relations with Cadet Skeral.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s eyes widened almost comically. \u201cDid he tell you that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. And that is not an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the answer is no,\u201d he said, now glaring. \u201cYou thought I was seeing other people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI made no assumption, however, it is not an unreasonable possibility,\u201d Spock said calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would it be reasonable to think something like that? Who would I be seeing?\u201d Jim stood up, slamming the PADD on the desk. \u201cMore logically, when would I have time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock opened his mouth, but nothing came out for a moment. \u201cI see I have angered you. I apologize, it was not my intent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen make your intent clear,\u201d Jim said, his voice sounding much louder in the nearly empty room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have not asked to formalize our relationship,\u201d Spock said. \u201cI would not have you feel obligated to do so, nor would I want you to feel compelled in light of your possible commission aboard the Shenandoah. It is an excellent opportunity, and may meet your short-term needs at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy needs\u2026\u201d Jim muttered. The anger at the underhanded suggestion that was boiling to the surface. \u201cYou think I was looking for a short-term one-off with the Shenandoah and couldn\u2019t handle a bigger commitment like the Enterprise? Well, I really like the Enterprise, more than anything, really. And this time I\u2019ve been waiting for the Enterprise to ask me to commit because I hear that\u2019s the way it\u2019s done. Did you ever think of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock recoiled a half step at Jim\u2019s words. \u201cI do not believe you are speaking about starships anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just then, one of the machines in the back room beeped, and Jim threw his hands in the air. \u201cI give up!\u201d he said to the empty room at large and turned to do his job without giving the surprised Vulcan another look.</p>\n<p>Jim leaned over the large machine and was surprised when a hand abruptly turned him and pressed him into a wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be back here--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not giving up,\u201d Spock insisted, his hand raised, caressing the side of Jim\u2019s face. \u201cI would not want you to dismiss me based on my poor behavior just now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim\u2019s breath caught, forgetting what they were arguing about. Spock was <em>touching him</em>. Finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said yesterday that you always knew where you stood with me,\u201d Spock said, leaning in, lips almost touching. \u201cBeside me. I would have you stand beside me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven on the Enterprise?\u201d Jim asked, looking firmly into the dark brown eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnywhere,\u201d Spock whispered, and Jim closed the gap between their lips with a satisfied groan. Spock eagerly and clumsily returned the kiss. Jim threaded his fingers through thick black hair, delighting in the curve of Spock\u2019s ear and the small noise he made when Jim nipped his bottom lip. Spock\u2019s other hand reached beneath Jim\u2019s uniform shirt and painted a wide path across his lower back, making him groan and grind his hips into Spock\u2019s.</p>\n<p>They broke apart when the help desk computer chimed, alerting Jim that a patron was at the desk. He was grateful they were both hidden from the view of the outside room.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jim groaned, this time in defeat, resting his head against Spock\u2019s chest. \u201cThis is the <em>boring </em>part of the library. No one comes here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock took a step back, straightening his black uniform, and running a hand over his slightly mussed hair. Jim couldn\u2019t help but grin at the sight. He\u2019d done it. He messed up those perfect Vulcan bangs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware this may not be the most opportune moment, but am I correct in inferring you wish to engage in a mutually committed and exclusive relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim smiled, smoothing Spock\u2019s shirt for good measure. \u201cIf you can't infer that, I obviously wasn\u2019t doing it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock stared at Jim a moment in wonder. \u201cIf you are not otherwise occupied, I invite you to my home for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim nodded, still smiling. \u201c1800, after my shift?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock nodded shortly and turned on his heel out of astrometrics without another word, leaving Jim to calm down and greet his record-breaking third visitor in one hour.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Jim and Spock sat opposite each other at the small table in Spock\u2019s living area, staring at each other and not saying a word. The tension was thick, and all Jim could think about was dragging Spock by his lapels across the table and seeing how far down he could coax the delicious green flush from earlier.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe soup is delicious,\u201d Jim said, finally breaking the silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the Lady Amanda\u2019s recipe,\u201d Senik said from the kitchen. \u201cShe advised me to include more salt to enhance the flavor of the traditional Vulcan dish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well please relay my compliments to your mother,\u201d Jim said to Spock. Spock nodded and slowly ate his own bowl of soup, occasionally glancing back into the kitchen area where Senik was chopping vegetables.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many courses are there?\u201d Jim whispered, which was for naught, as Senik\u2019s Vulcan hearing picked up the question.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven,\u201d Senik replied. \u201cOr more, if my penance is unsatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim repressed a sigh. He had been hoping for a quiet meal with Spock, unaware that Senik had appropriated the evening for his demonstration of Vulcan guilt toward an honored guest. Seven courses of food were prepared for the appreciation of the offended. Judging by Spock\u2019s demeanor, this was not how he had planned the evening either.</p>\n<p>Senik appeared at Jim\u2019s elbow with a basket of freshly baked bread. \u201cKap,\u201d Senik explained and set it on the table. \u201cThe balkra is almost ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSenik, I\u2019m not even upset,\u201d Jim said again. \u201cThis is unnecessary. Illogical, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock merely raised an eyebrow at Jim as if to say, <em> you think I didn\u2019t try that? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI must reiterate that I now see the invasion of your privacy as a grievous error on my part, and in my zealous pursuit of science, I neglected to be sensitive to the harm or discomfort I may have caused you. While you are willing to overlook this, I cannot allow the error to go unaddressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen perhaps you should be serving your penance differently,\u201d Jim suggested. \u201cThe Human way, in deference to my\u2026 cultural needs.\u201d Senik perked up at that, turning around and waiting for Jim to explain. \u201cYou need to apologize, and then do me a favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA favor. Something I might not usually do in usual circumstances, in an act of goodwill. This is highly illogical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, it's remuneration,\u201d Jim said, and that seemed to appease the young Vulcan. \u201cWhat I need is privacy. You, in your room, and no coming out or eavesdropping until the morning. Replicate some headphones if you need to, but your cousin and I need to speak in private.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the walls are soundproofed in the standard way, headphones will be unnecessary,\u201d Senik said, turning to take a casserole out of the oven. He deposited it on the counter to cool and removed the exceedingly large oven mitts and turned to address Jim.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, I apologize for my behavior the last five weeks: observing you in your environment, appropriating your work and academic records, entering your dormitory, and distributing surveys among your living relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim was speechless. \u201cYou broke into my dorm? And talked to my mom?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik flushed green. \u201cI did not enter your room, merely the building.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you contacted my mother. She filled out a survey?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Senik nodded. \u201cThe data compiled from Winona Kirk and the Lady Amanda were used as-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would my mother be relevant in your data collection?\u201d Spock said, suddenly finding his tongue for the first time. So, Spock wasn\u2019t aware of the true nature of Senik\u2019s scientific endeavors either.</p>\n<p>Senik\u2019s eyes widened in realization. \u201cI am mistaken, tomasu. There are two parties I must make amends with this evening. Spock, son of Sarek, I have harmed thee,\u201d Senik intoned the traditional words for the second time that evening, \u201cand seek thy forgiveness in--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI request the Human apology as well,\u201d Spock interjected, an almost brittle tone to his voice. \u201cThere is no need to list your grievances, I will hear them later. Go to your room. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik nodded, giving one last look at the couple at the table, and went to his room and closed the door firmly. Jim sighed and glanced over to Spock. \u201cKids, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not believe all Vulcan children are as he is,\u201d Spock said.</p>\n<p>Jim grinned. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I like him, and I can\u2019t even be mad. I mean, if he hadn\u2019t brought us together, who knows how or if we would have met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow indeed?\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, Jim found himself being walked backward toward Spock\u2019s bed, his hands anxiously tearing at the blue tunic Spock seemed to favor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure he can\u2019t hear us?\u201d Jim asked again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Spock murmured into the skin of Jim\u2019s neck where he was nipping a trail up to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t bugged your bedroom?\u201d Jim added. Spock stopped his exploration of Jim\u2019s neck immediately, eyes wide. \u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you do not object, I possess a tool that will confirm no surveillance equipment is installed,\u201d Spock said. Jim could only nod. Before Spock left he gave him one more deep kiss and left Jim alone in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>As simple and standardly human as the living area was, Spock\u2019s bedroom was completely decadent and filled with Vulcan treasures. The sumptuous red wall coverings and ornate statues all spoke of a homeworld far from Riverside, Iowa. Jim toed off his socks and flopped on the bed, which was surprisingly soft, save for something that was digging into his back. He reached behind his back and pulled out the forgotten PADD.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to pry, but when the words \u201c<em> erotic bliss rising inside her like the Fire Plains of Kir\u201d </em> caught his attention and he could not stop reading.</p>\n<p>When Spock returned with his device, he found Jim sprawled on his bed, one hand on the PADD and the other hand over his mouth, muffling his chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was part of Senik\u2019s Terran literary artifact archive,\u201d Spock explained, almost apologetically, alerting Jim to his presence. Jim looked up and smiled broadly. \"He thought to share the stories as instructive, but I have not found them useful.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, because it\u2019s complete nonsense, you know. No one has sex or romance like in the books or holos.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock\u2019s brow furrowed slightly and turned on the scanner and set it on a tall chest of drawers. \u201cI find myself grateful for that. The descriptions were... unusual and the biology was quite illogical.\" Jim had just finished reading the part where <em>the many colors of passion entwined in their rainbow of love </em>and had to agree.</p>\n<p>The scanner beeped. \"There is no surveillance equipment in the general vicinity,\u201d Spock reported and Jim sighed gratefully. He really didn\u2019t want to drag Spock back to his dorm room and kick out Bones. Jim set the PADD on the bedside table and stood up, taking Spock\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>Jim gave Spock a fond half-smile. \u201cYou know, I thought Vulcans didn\u2019t like to be touched, I was always so afraid to touch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is true that touch is a very intimate thing, saved between family and bondmates,\u201d Spock said quietly, taking one of Jim\u2019s hands and tracing the outside of his hand with two of his fingers. \u201cThis is ozh\u2019esta, how two Vulcans would kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOzh\u2019esta,\u201d Jim repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re my first Vulcan kiss,\u201d Jim said with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are mine,\u201d Spock said simply, which brought Jim up short.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour first? You mean you haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have never engaged in a romantic or sexual relationship,\u201d Spock admitted. \u201cI would not if I did not feel\u2026\u201d Spock trailed off, unsure of the precise foreign emotions he was experiencing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jim assured him. \u201cMe too. I mean, I\u2019ve never felt like this. With anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock nodded and returned the gentle caress with renewed interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we were doing all of this the Vulcan way, what would happen?\u201d Jim asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have offered mnah, my proposal of marriage, days ago and if you accepted, I would bring you to my father\u2019s house, and present you as my chosen mate,\u201d Spock said, rapt attention on Jim\u2019s fingers caressing his own. \u201cWe would have a bonding ceremony, and we would be telik, bonded, and married.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim pondered that while exploring Spock\u2019s hands. \u201cIs that what you expect of us one day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJim, we are not a Vulcan couple, and I have no such expectations of us,\" Spock said earnestly. \"We are together, it is enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether,\u201d Jim repeated. \u201cI like that.\u201d He hooked his two fingers around Spock and used them to lead him back to the bed and spent the next few hours showing Spock what else \u2018together\u2019 could entail.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>The next morning, Jim opened an eye to see a rumpled-looking Spock, complete with green-black stubble, sprawled over \u00be of the bed. Jim nudged the stray limbs out of the way and laid his head on the space between his shoulder and chest.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Spock did not wake gradually. As soon as Jim\u2019s head made contact with his chest, he jolted and looked down at Jim with wide alert eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have overslept by 1.8 hours,\u201d he announced, disbelief evident in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a class for another hour. Are you running late?\u201d Jim mumbled, snaking his arm around the other\u2019s torso, feeling the steady heartbeat in his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I am unused to oversleeping. It is quite unusual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim moved his head to better look up at his lover. \u201cWe did many unusual things last night,\u201d he teased, waggling his eyebrows for effect. \u201cAll of them worth repeating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock\u2019s ear tips flushed, which only made Jim smile at the memory of that flush extending down his neck and past his clavicle. Jim had traced every inch of it with his tongue and discovered his Vulcan was slightly ticklish.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Jim said. He gave the shoulder a quick kiss and swung his legs down, finding his clothes in a heap with Spock\u2019s. He fished out his underwear and trousers, intent on making it to the bathroom. Once he shimmied into his clothes, he threw a saucy wink to Spock, who was unabashedly watching him dress and quietly opened the door to sneak down the hall to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>As soon as he turned around, a short figure was at his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have engaged in coitus,\u201d Senik announced loudly. Jim flushed with embarrassment and gestured for him to be quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are supposed to be in your room,\u201d Jim hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is morning, my penance is complete,\u201d the boy pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s complete, which means you must have learned something about the private lives of people around you,\u201d Jim whispered pointedly. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business what we adults do. Now leave me alone until I\u2019ve had my morning coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik stepped aside to allow Jim to amble to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cCadet Kirk, while this shall never make it into my final results, I am pleased to note that this behavior supports my hypothesis.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Jim grumbled, still incredibly embarrassed, but much too happy to let it get him down for long.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Captain Pike leaned back in his seat behind the desk, staring at his Vulcan officer. \u201cAnd this relationship is romantic in nature?\u201d</p>\n<p>Spock nodded once, ramrod straight in his seat. \u201cYes, we are engaged in a romantic relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pike took the PADD and started to read.</p>\n<p>\n<em> The interspecies humanoid hypothesis has long been used to predict romantic and sexual interspecies relationships between all gendered humanoid species. This author has sought to illustrate how this hypothesis can be refuted using biological principles of heterospecific biological cues. The collected objective data were fitted into a multivariate logistic regression model, denoting each set of environmental and biological covariates\u2026. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAn academic paper?\u201d Pike asked. \u201cWhy are you giving me this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA promising scientist has data that supports that a relationship between Cadet Kirk and myself would not only be beneficial to ourselves but benefit our vocation and community.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cSpock, do you need statistics to determine if you want to date someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Spock replied. \u201cBut it certainly helps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. When you two get hitched, I expect the prenup to be in a peer-reviewed journal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSarcasm, Commander. Permission granted. I want Kirk aboard the Enterprise next month for training with the other command-track cadets and I\u2019ll recommend him for lieutenant upon his graduation. You are dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Spock said and walked out of the office, an almost discernable bounce in his step.</p>\n<p>Pike waited until Spock had closed the door to scroll down to the bottom of the paper.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2026 reaching the conclusion that both Subject Spock and Subject Kirk, by all measures of objective data, are a superior combination.

Cadet, maybe you\u2019d like to make use of the officer\u2019s mess, which you have access to this week. Might as well take advantage of the privacy aboard while with Cadet Twi, before you all are back at the Academy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik raised his eyebrows, grateful for the man\u2019s forethought. \u201cThank you, Captain, I will do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs 1900 too early?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo early for what, sir?\u201d Senik asked, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Spock and I will want to be sure to get front-row seats for your first date,\u201d Jim explained, his eyes alight with mischief. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been a study of Andorian-Vulcan courtship behavior. I think in a week we could compile a couple of terraquads of data--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo point seven terraquads of data,\u201d Spock supplemented.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, at least that much data in the span of our week-long training mission. I could pool resources from the rest of the science department. This study has real potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>Senik\u2019s eyes widened in alarm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not believe that the captain intends to exact any revenge for your actions as a child,\u201d Spock intoned from his seat at the desk. Senik relaxed fractionally.</p>\n<p>Jim smiled and slapped him on the back. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he agreed and ushered Senik out of the door. Just before the pneumatic doors closed, Senik could hear Jim\u2019s voice calling down the corridor:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not revenge\u2026 <em> it\u2019s science</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fin.</b>\n</p>"
