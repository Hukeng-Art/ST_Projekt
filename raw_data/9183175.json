  "notes": "<p>So once upon a time, Rageprufrock was like, \"HANNIBAL,\" and I was like, \"But I'm easily scared and I don't think I would like it. It's about a cannibal, right?\" And then I basically finished watching the whole series in two weeks with both Pru and N figuratively and sometimes literally holding my hand, and this happened. Thanks to Pru and Twentysomething for audiencing, and to Lynnmonster for the beta -- one of the loveliest things about a new fandom is finding old fannish friends in it. You guys are all great.</p>",
  "text": "<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Because Will\u2019s life is bullshit, he gets gently kidnapped from the hospital after Hannibal guts him.</p>\n<p>At least, he muses, his kidnapper had the good sense to wait until Will no longer has to contend with a temporary colostomy bag. She also has the good sense to realize that Will is a cornered animal and not going down with a fight. Instead of repeating her request for him to get in the wheelchair, she takes out a phone and makes a call before handing it to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d comes Abigail\u2019s voice. It\u2019s not an especially good connection; he holds the phone tightly to his ear, as if he could reach her. The last thing he remembers seeing after Hannibal introduced a knife to his belly was Hannibal ushering Abigail out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbigail?\u201d he croaks out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d she asks, and Will has to bite back any number of sarcastic responses, because he knows Abigail is doing her best with the hand she was dealt, and Will doesn\u2019t like some of her choices, but he can\u2019t blame her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sick of pudding,\u201d he tells her. He almost can\u2019t believe it\u2019s her at all -- he grieved her the entire time he was held in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, and to think she\u2019s been alive all this time, that he\u2019s lucky enough to get a second chance, well. In Will\u2019s experience, he\u2019s rarely that lucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cHospital pudding sucks,\u201d she agrees. \u201cYou\u2019re okay to leave the hospital, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd go where?\u201d he asks. There\u2019s been no talk of him being discharged yet, and he highly doubts they want him to go back to his house alone in any case.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Abigail says. \u201cWith us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will blows out a breath, and then says, \u201cPut your other dad on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abigail, being a smart girl, doesn\u2019t bother to pretend that she has to go get Hannibal, who has undoubtedly been listening to this entire conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal says, and his voice sounds so familiar that it aches. \u201cDid you get the flowers I sent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, but I feel I have to mention that it\u2019s kind of fucked up because you\u2019re the reason I\u2019m here in the first place,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it if you hadn\u2019t betrayed me,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not start with me,\u201d Will warns him, because if he starts yelling about all the ways Hannibal has betrayed <i>him</i>, he\u2019s not going to stop, and that\u2019s definitely going to attract the wrong kind of attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about Abigail wanting me to come to you? I thought you were pretty clear about how you felt about me when you left me to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not leave you to die,\u201d Hannibal says, and he sounds <i>offended</i>, like Will accused him of spitting in the soup. \u201cWhatever else, I would hope you trust my skill with a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you just meant to maim me, is that it? So far I\u2019m not finding this a compelling argument to come back for round two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal says, and then delicately clears his throat. \u201cI may have...overreacted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes the phone away from his ear and stares at it for a moment, because what the actual fuck. \u201cReally,\u201d he says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your chart, and you\u2019re well enough to travel with assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you\u2019ve seen my chart,\u201d Will says, resigned. \u201cAnd I think I want a second opinion on that one, since my actual doctors don\u2019t seem that hot about me walking five feet, never mind checking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy associate will see to it that you don\u2019t overexert yourself on your way here. Then you will recuperate under my care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will refuses to dignify that with a response.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur care,\u201d Hannibal amends. \u201cMine and Abigail\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou manipulative asshole,\u201d Will says tiredly, and closes his eyes. \u201cWhat is this, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re long overdue for a family vacation, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my fucking god,\u201d Will says, and takes great joy in hanging up on him.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost impressed with how easily this woman smuggles him out the hospital -- not that Will is really up to fighting back, but he could have definitely given her trouble if he hadn\u2019t been complicit in his own kidnapping. She has clothes for him -- a soft cashmere sweater and pants that look way nicer than they should, considering that the waist is elastic. She\u2019s militant about him sitting in the wheelchair instead of walking, and he really doesn\u2019t care to argue, especially by the time they get to Dulles and he feels like his stomach is on fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I allowed to ask where we\u2019re going?\u201d he ventures as she helps him into an airport-issue wheelchair.</p>\n<p>\u201cJapan,\u201d she says shortly.</p>\n<p>He has questions, like how, because it\u2019s not like he had his passport on him when he was admitted to the hospital. But it turns out that he didn\u2019t need his passport, anyway -- she hands him one that says his name is David Anders. \u201cSure,\u201d Will says under his breath. \u201cAnd what do I call you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She regards him steadily, and then says, \u201cChiyoh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you, I suppose,\u201d Will says. He\u2019s not sure what the etiquette is regarding dubiously consensual abduction, but he can at least make a half-assed effort at politeness for someone who\u2019s probably just doing her job.</p>\n<p>Chiyoh says nothing to that and just pushes his wheelchair to the counter to check in. The ticket agent only spares a glance at Will, and converses in what Will is pretty sure is Japanese with Chiyoh for the whole check-in process. It\u2019s also the quickest Will has ever gotten through security at Dulles, which momentarily restores Will\u2019s faith in humanity; the TSA agents actually smile at him while waving him through the precheck line.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, they\u2019re flying ANA from the main terminal, which means they only have to deal with maneuvering the wheelchair onto the aerotrain and not a shuttle bus.</p>\n<p>When they arrive at their gate, Chiyoh checks her phone and then says, \u201cWould you like a book or some magazines for the flight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he just text you that?\u201d Will asks. \u201cIf I\u2019m good, do I get snacks, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe food on the plane will be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince <i>when</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince he paid for first class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says, taken aback. He\u2019s never flown first class in his life. And then, a little more meekly, he says, \u201cA magazine might be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pushes his wheelchair to one of the ubiquitous airport bookstores, and since he\u2019s completely up on celebrity gossip against his will after being stuck in the hospital, he picks up a fishing magazine and Popular Mechanics and a nonfiction book on maritime history.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019ve boarded the plane and Will has carefully lowered himself into his seat next to the window, exhaustion hits him hard. He barely did anything, but apparently he\u2019s used up all the energy reserves he has left.</p>\n<p>The flight attendant comes by, and Will regrets that he can\u2019t drink with the medication he\u2019s on, because the beverage menu is insane. He asks for water and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re in the air, the flight attendant comes by with a tray just for Will. On it is a covered bowl and a shallow dish with a variety of pills in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Will says intelligently. He looks at Chiyoh. \u201cDo I want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes are closed. \u201cHis instructions were specific.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since he didn\u2019t get discharged, he didn\u2019t get any prescriptions to get filled, which means he has no idea what\u2019s in front of him. But if Hannibal were going to kill him, he would have done it already; Will\u2019s distantly aware that\u2019s a little fucked up, but it doesn\u2019t even make his top twenty.</p>\n<p>He takes the lid off the bowl; it\u2019s miso soup with tofu, which definitely fits his current soft food diet. He stares at it and thinks about Hannibal not wanting him to take medication on an empty stomach.</p>\n<p>He manages half the soup before swallowing the mystery pills, which he hopes include the antibiotics he\u2019s been on as well as something for pain, because the last dose he had in the hospital has definitely worn off. It must, because he feels a little floaty. When he comes back from the lavatory, the other passengers are ordering dinner, which Will has no interest in. His seat has already been converted to a bed, and Will crawls into it and falls deeply asleep.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The plane lands at Narita around five p.m. local time, and Will expects to follow the hordes of people to public transit. But instead, there\u2019s a car waiting for them, and a man wearing a uniform with white gloves helps him into the backseat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asks Chiyoh. He doesn\u2019t expect an answer, and he doesn\u2019t get one. Instead he gets a triangular rice ball, a bottle that purports to be \u201cstraight tea\u201d, and several more pills. He eats the rice ball minus the seaweed -- he\u2019s not sure if his intestines can handle it and he\u2019s unwilling to take chances -- and is pleasantly surprised by the tuna with mayo in the middle. He opens the tea to wash down the pills, and it\u2019s a little sweetened.</p>\n<p>They drive for a few hours, and it\u2019s dark by the time they turn into a gated driveway and pull up to the front door. The entrance is lit softly, and when the door opens to reveal Abigail and Hannibal, Will is very worried that this is a dream, and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do if it is.</p>\n<p>Chiyoh has one small bag in the trunk, which the driver retrieves. Will has nothing except the clothes he\u2019s wearing, the ones that Hannibal sent for him. Both Will\u2019s door and Chiyoh\u2019s open automatically -- she\u2019s already out and greeting Hannibal and Abigail with a brief, shallow bow. </p>\n<p>Will stays where he is, at least in part because he\u2019s not sure he can actually move.</p>\n<p>Abigail breaks from the doorway and says, \u201cYou made it! Aren\u2019t you coming inside?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will maneuvers his legs out of the car and then comes to a stop. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s really overdone it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal says, and bends over to look at him. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Will says tightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cPut your arms around my neck, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Will says, but he does it anyway, because he would like to get out of the car at some point today. Hannibal gets an arm under his knees and one around his back, and then lifts him up cleanly. Hauling corpses around must be good practice.</p>\n<p>Because he\u2019s a dick, Hannibal pauses at the door and gives Will a significant look, like Will has somehow missed that he\u2019s being carried over the threshold, bridal-style.</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Will says as Hannibal maneuvers them through the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t hit my head against the frame -- a concussion is the last thing I need right now. I said, <i>watch it</i>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Hannibal says with every appearance of fondness. He manages to step out of his shoes in the foyer without jostling Will or dropping him, and then proceeds down the hallway in his socks. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s really no point in not being honest. \u201cNot really. Just tired,\u201d Will says. </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Hannibal says with gentle sympathy that Will has no resistance to. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long flight, and you\u2019re not at your best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal carries him into a room with tatami mats and a futon on the floor -- the real deal, not the monstrosity that served as Will\u2019s bed and couch during grad school -- and gently lowers him. Will hisses in pain as he lies down on the futon, and Hannibal frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize for the less than ideal setup for your recovery,\u201d Hannibal says, kneeling next to Will. \u201cI\u2019d like to take a look at those stitches, if I may.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will waves a hand in the direction of his midsection, which really fucking hurts. \u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d he manages. It\u2019s not that Hannibal couldn\u2019t hurt him more, but at the moment, it feels like he would really have to put some effort into it.</p>\n<p>Hannibal pushes Will\u2019s sweater up, and then clucks his tongue. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve pulled a stitch or two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks down, and yup, he\u2019s definitely bleeding through the gauze wrapped around his torso.</p>\n<p>Abigail comes in, then, and hands a leather bag to Hannibal, which turns out to be a medical kit. She kneels next to Hannibal and watches him cut the gauze.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdequate, I suppose,\u201d Hannibal says of Will\u2019s stitches, which is the same thing he said about Will\u2019s suit for his trial, which Will knows for a fact he wanted to light on fire. \u201cPay attention, Abigail -- this is a useful life skill everyone should have some basic knowledge of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will thinks about arguing that most people just go to the ER and that most people don\u2019t have massive traumatic wounds requiring stitches in the first place, but concedes that Abigail is not most people. Instead, he says, \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re going to give me anesthetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannibal says soothingly, and brushes Will\u2019s hair out of his eyes with a gloved hand.</p>\n<p>He zones out as Hannibal talks Abigail through wound care and how to administer a local anesthetic, and not long after he feels the tugging of skin as Hannibal adds a few stitches, he hears the snap of Hannibal taking his gloves off. He touches Will\u2019s face again, and Will struggles to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe site is a little inflamed, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cRest and medication will help. Can you manage some food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal apparently interprets that as yes. He nods to Abigail, who disappears off into the hallway, before easing Will up enough to lean against Hannibal\u2019s chest. Abigail comes back with a tray with yet another covered bowl and a dish of pills. </p>\n<p>\u201cI made it,\u201d she says, taking the lid off the bowl. It looks like some kind of rice porridge. \u201cI mean, Hannibal told me how to do it.\u201d She spoons up a little and holds it up to his mouth, and Will just doesn\u2019t have the heart to refuse, even though he really is not remotely hungry. He opens his mouth and closes it around the spoon, and yeah, that\u2019s rice porridge. It doesn\u2019t taste great -- it doesn\u2019t really taste like anything much, but he would sooner swallow glass than tell Abigail that. She spoons the porridge into this mouth with great concentration, her brow creased in worry, and it occurs to Will that she\u2019s worried about <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Abigail.\u201d</p>\n<p>She bites her lip but continues to slowly feed him, while Hannibal strokes his fingertips against Will\u2019s neck, as if to aid Will swallowing. It should be really fucking creepy, but Will is officially out of fucks to give, and anyway, it feels nice. He only manages half the bowl again, and Abigail looks unhappy but gives him his pills and a glass of water to wash them down with. </p>\n<p>When she leaves the room again with the tray, Will smacks Hannibal\u2019s knee, which is currently the easiest part of him to reach. \u201cCongratulations on traumatizing her again. You couldn\u2019t have sent her out of the room before you gutted me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal is silent for a few moments. Then he says, \u201cI was going to kill her. In front of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will squeezes his eyes shut. He can feel the rise and fall of Hannibal\u2019s chest against his back. He\u2019s being cradled by a serial-killing drama queen. He really should be more concerned about it than he is; maybe it\u2019s the drugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell her that,\u201d Will says finally, fingers clenching the fabric of Hannibal\u2019s trousers. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt her again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal is quiet again. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep my promises, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Will says. Hannibal eases him down onto the futon, then fusses with the pillow and the thick comforter until Will is tucked in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you require no assurances for your own safety?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could ask you the same,\u201d Will says tartly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal smiles. \u201cSo you could,\u201d he says, and strokes his hand over the side of Will\u2019s face before standing up, and pulling a cord attached to the overhead light. \u201cSleep well, dear Will. Good night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d Will sighs out, and Hannibal slides the door closed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He wakes once in the night when his pain medication wears off. It\u2019s not totally dark in the room; there\u2019s enough light coming in the window that Will can tell he\u2019s not alone.</p>\n<p>It takes a minute for his brain to remember that yes, he\u2019s in Japan, yes, he\u2019s sleeping on the floor, and yes, that\u2019s Hannibal, asleep on a futon beside his.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal,\u201d he whispers. He reaches out carefully; he\u2019s half-terrified that Hannibal\u2019s skin will be cold to the touch.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s shoulder is warm, and his hand comes up to clasp Will\u2019s. \u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal says, voice rough with sleep. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will needs a lot of things, but first things first. \u201cCan you help me up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal gets Will upright and then shuffles them to the tiny bathroom attached to the room. It\u2019s just a toilet with a sink on top of the tank that runs water while the tank is filling. There\u2019s no mirror or anything, which is just as well because Will is pretty sure he looks like hot garbage.</p>\n<p>Hannibal consents to let Will piss in peace with the door closed, but once Will is done, he opens the door again and looks critically at Will in the bathroom light.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to get cleaned up before going back to bed?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can just tell me I stink,\u201d Will says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a real shower since--\u201d he waves vaguely at his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel better when you\u2019re clean,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will can\u2019t argue with that. Will swallows the pills Hannibal gives him, and then lets Hannibal walk him out of the room and down the hall before sliding open another door, to reveal a small changing area before the entrance to a tiled room with a big, deep tub and a hand-shower outside it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m on sponge baths only, right?\u201d Will says with no small amount of regret.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be very careful,\u201d Hannibal promises.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can wash myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe sensible, Will,\u201d Hannibal chides. \u201cYou can\u2019t reach your feet, and you certainly can\u2019t scrub your own back. Let me do this for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sighs, because Hannibal is annoyingly right, and strips. Hannibal applies a waterproof dressing over his stitches -- oh so conveniently on hand -- and then helps Will lower himself to sit on a plastic stool on the tiled floor outside the tub. He drapes a small towel over Will\u2019s lap, which Will snorts at.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for modesty -- you know that Freddie Lounds plastered a picture of me naked in my hospital bed all over her website, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He expects a response, and when he doesn\u2019t get one, he chances a look up at Hannibal.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is <i>furious</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says after a moment, when Hannibal has silently stripped down to his boxer-briefs and knelt behind Will. \u201cThat\u2019s why you sent Chiyoh. You couldn\u2019t stand it, could you? You literally cut me out of your life, but there I was, exposed to the world in high resolution. An entire photo gallery for anyone to consume.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal turns on the shower, and Will shivers when he braces Will with a hand between his shoulder blades and begins to rinse him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a violation,\u201d Hannibal says finally as he wets down Will\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf my privacy, or your claim on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s fingers tighten in Will\u2019s hair, and it makes Will gasp despite himself.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s lips are nearly touching Will\u2019s ear as he says, \u201cYou looked like St. Sebastian, suffering so beautifully, and she <i>dared</i>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re giving Freddie\u2019s photography skills a little too much credit,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal says nothing as he works shampoo into Will\u2019s damp hair. He tilts Will\u2019s head back, and the feel of his fingers massaging Will\u2019s scalp almost makes him want to moan in pleasure. By the time Hannibal rinses the shampoo out of his hair, Will feels like he\u2019s floating, high on whatever pain medication Hannibal had given him, unspooled by Hannibal\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>Hannibal washes his back next, and this is definitely nothing like the sponge baths in the hospital. Hannibal lingers over the scar on his shoulder with the washcloth, and traces Will\u2019s spine with his thumb. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight,\u201d he murmurs, and he sounds displeased.</p>\n<p>\u201cHard not to, considering my recent diet,\u201d Will says. Hannibal soaps up one of his armpits then, which is kind of weird and he wasn\u2019t exactly expecting it, but he lets it happen. While Hannibal is scrubbing the rest of his arm, taking care to remove the leftover adhesive from his elbow where he\u2019d had an IV inserted, Will says, \u201cAlana found me on your kitchen floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Hannibal says. He moves the towel he\u2019s been kneeling on so that he can reach Will\u2019s feet. The washcloth between Will\u2019s toes makes him squirm a little; Hannibal\u2019s thumbs digging into the arch of his foot makes him sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was calling for an ambulance when one showed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal switches to the other foot. With Will\u2019s ankle in his hand, he says, \u201cAs I said, I did not leave you there to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you did leave me,\u201d Will says, and it sounds so miserable coming out of his mouth that he wishes he could take it back.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a time,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cHave I not brought you home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what this is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal rinses him off, and brings his hands to rest on Will\u2019s thighs, just below where the towel is draped over his lap. \u201cIt can be,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Will doesn\u2019t know what to say to that, because so much has happened, and it\u2019s objectively fucking crazy, and yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething to think about,\u201d Hannibal says lightly, as if he\u2019s tabling an unproductive line of inquiry in therapy. \u201cFor now, your priority is to recover. The rest can wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will finds himself nodding.</p>\n<p>Hannibal cleans gently around the waterproof dressing, taking extra care. Then he holds out the washcloth and says, \u201cWould you like to do the rest?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says. \u201cUh, yeah. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal inclines his head and rises to his feet before stepping into the small side room, and Will takes the opportunity to clean between his legs. He isn\u2019t hard, but his body feels like it\u2019s humming from Hannibal\u2019s hands all over his skin. </p>\n<p>Hannibal is wearing a cotton robe that looks like a less fancy kimono when he comes back into the bathroom to help Will up. Hannibal hands him a towel, and when he\u2019s dry, swaps out the waterproof dressing for another layer of sterile gauze. Finally, he gives Will a robe like the one he\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s a deep blue with carp around the hem, and Hannibal tugs the shoulders into place, and then carefully ties the belt so that it won\u2019t rub against Will\u2019s stitches. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, is free-balling traditional in this getup?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a suggestion of a smile at the corner of Hannibal\u2019s lips. \u201cPerfectly acceptable for sleeping,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd in any case, you didn\u2019t bring any clothes with you at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing except what you gave me,\u201d Will says, and Hannibal\u2019s hand tightens on his hip.</p>\n<p>Oh, you possessive motherfucker, Will thinks. You <i>like</i> that. You did that on purpose.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what this is, or what Hannibal wants, but if Hannibal is going to fuck with him, Will is going to fuck with him right back. He slides his hands up to rest on Hannibal\u2019s shoulders, and then says, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, but Will can feel him take in a short breath. \u201cTo bed, then,\u201d he says, and picks Will up again and carries him back to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late morning when Will wakes up again, judging by the sun coming in the window. He\u2019s warm under the thick duvet, but his nose is a little cold. He lies there for a few minutes, before he determines that he really does need to get up.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t do that without help, and it occurs to him to wonder just how much his current sleeping arrangements are deliberate. He could try to get up on his own, but that seems like a profoundly bad idea, even for him. He takes in a deep breath and hollers Hannibal\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>He hears a door slide open and shut and footsteps in the hallway, and then the bedroom door slides open to reveal Hannibal in an apron.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me up?\u201d Will asks. He really doesn\u2019t like feeling this dependent, but he doesn\u2019t have a choice except to cling to Hannibal\u2019s shoulders while Hannibal muscles him up to standing. He\u2019s still weak, and still in pain, but he can make it to the toilet by himself and tells Hannibal as much.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting for you in the kitchen,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will grunts in response before pulling the bathroom door shut behind him.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have far to go to reach the kitchen, thankfully, and it\u2019s not a mystery as to which room it is. He hears a tea kettle whistle, and the next open doorway reveals Hannibal pouring the water into a teapot, and Abigail sitting at a table with a laptop and a few books, doing what looks like -- homework?</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Will says, his voice still raspy.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Will,\u201d Hannibal says, looking pleased. \u201cCome, sit down.\u201d He pulls out a chair for Will next to Abigail.</p>\n<p>The kitchen is small -- smaller than he would have expected for Hannibal, anyway, with the small round kitchen table taking up floor space that Will bets Hannibal would rather have devoted to an island or more prep space. It opens to a room with a raised floor and more tatami, with a low table that has a blanket covering the sides. Hannibal puts the tea kettle on top of a kerosene heater between the two rooms, spout uncovered so that it can release steam into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you cold? Where are your slippers?\u201d Hannibal asks. These are apparently rhetorical questions, because he bustles down the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to fuss,\u201d Abigail says, her smile conspiratorial. \u201cA lot. You should let him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I should, should I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d she says. Her hair is tucked behind one ear, but it hangs loose over the other.</p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s no ear there to tuck it behind, he remembers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d he asks, veering away from the thought abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal\u2019s home schooling me so I can get my GED,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Will raises his eyebrows. \u201cI assume he forged you a new identity, too. He couldn\u2019t forge you a high school diploma in the process?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEducation is important, Will,\u201d Hannibal tuts from the doorway. He then kneels beside Will and slides warm slippers on his feet -- oh right, they were beside the bedroom door and he had ignored them -- and rises to tuck a wool wrap of some sort around Will\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHow is our daughter to apply to the best schools if she does not have an exemplary foundation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe could pass the GED exam right now,\u201d Will says, exasperated. \u201cHigh school teaches kids obedience more than anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat may be one explanation for your grasp of Latin, but not one I am willing to accept,\u201d Hannibal tells Abigail, who groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has cases and too many tenses,\u201d she complains, and looks to Will beseechingly. \u201cTell him I don\u2019t need Latin for college.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe reasonable, daddy,\u201d Will drawls with bone-dry sarcasm.</p>\n<p>Hannibal stares at him. It takes several seconds, in fact, for Hannibal to turn his attention to Abigail long enough to say, \u201cA classical education is never a waste.\u201d Then he puts one hand on Will\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll make you breakfast. You must be hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will isn\u2019t, particularly, but he knows Hannibal isn\u2019t going to dose him on an empty stomach, so resigns himself to eating something. He guiltily hopes it\u2019s not more of the rice gruel.</p>\n<p>He watches Hannibal cook, moving around the small space with as much ease as he had in his kitchen in Baltimore. The kitchen where Hannibal had held him close and slid a knife into his belly. And now Hannibal is gently scrambling some eggs while Abigail quietly types out an essay, and Will is there with them, waiting for his body to knit itself back together.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d Will asks suddenly. \u201cI thought you would go somewhere in Europe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had intended for the three of us to go to Paris,\u201d Hannibal says, plating the eggs before retrieving several containers from the fridge. \u201cThis is something of a stop along the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will raises his eyebrows at Hannibal as he sets down the plate of eggs in front of him, along with a dish of what looks like yogurt with some kind of fruit puree. \u201cMaybe I should be in charge of the geography tutoring, because Japan is really not on the way to France.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may certainly discuss your contribution to Abigail\u2019s education,\u201d Hannibal says, and then fixes Will with a pointed look. \u201cAfter you eat your breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal pours tea for the three of them before taking his seat at the table, and Will starts in on the eggs. They\u2019re soft and buttery, and a far cry from hospital cafeteria cuisine. Hannibal is not even pretending to do anything but stare at Will as he slowly works his way through his plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I cite something when I\u2019m using two sources with the same author?\u201d Abigail mutters, maybe to herself.</p>\n<p>Will finishes his last mouthful of eggs. \u201cDepends. What format is he making you use?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMLA,\u201d Abigail says, looking dejected.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou monster,\u201d Will says to Hannibal.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe should be comfortable with multiple citation formats,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve used anything except APA for years,\u201d Will says, but gestures to Abigail to turn her laptop toward him so he can google his old stand-by reference site.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He tires quickly after he helps Abigail conquer MLA, and it isn\u2019t long before Hannibal puts a gentle hand on the nape of his neck and says, \u201cYou need your rest, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will knows he does, but he doesn\u2019t want to go back to the bedroom by himself. Abigail has migrated to the low table in the living room, where she\u2019s working on crocheting something while the TV is on with the volume low. He looks at Hannibal, then looks at Abigail, and some of it must show on his face because Hannibal\u2019s eyes soften minutely.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I sit with you until you fall asleep in your room, or would you like me to bring your futon out here?\u201d</p>\n<p>It hadn\u2019t exactly occurred to Will that the latter was an option. \u201cOut here would be good,\u201d Will says cautiously.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s tucked into his futon, Hannibal settles into one of the floor chairs at the low table and takes up his tablet. Whatever is on TV is in soft Japanese that rolls over him, and as his eyes fall shut, he feels Hannibal\u2019s hand stroking through his hair.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When Will drifts back awake, it\u2019s apparently just in time for lunch, and whatever it is, it smells <i>delicious</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me I get to eat some of that,\u201d Will says, struggling up on his elbows.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will fit perfectly into your current diet, with some minor alterations,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cThere\u2019s a clean yukata in your room, if you would like to change before lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods and waits for Hannibal to help him up. The wool wrap Hannibal gave him earlier is laid out on top of his comforter -- it turns out to be a wide-sleeved open jacket kind of thing, like he\u2019s seen in Kurosawa movies. Hannibal retrieves it and holds it up so that Will can put his arms through the sleeves.</p>\n<p>Hannibal returns to the stove, and when Will comes close, he dips a spoon in one of the pots on the stove and holds it out for Will to taste.</p>\n<p>Time spent with Hannibal has given Will more vocabulary to describe food, and this broth is just as good as it smells -- rich, creamy, with a great depth of flavor, like Hannibal simmered pork bones for days.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that tonkotsu?\u201d Will asks. Nowadays, he mostly eats at home or at the Academy cafeteria, but there was a ramen restaurant near GWU that he had an intense and meaningful fling with while writing his master\u2019s thesis.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I had to do something while waiting for you to arrive,\u201d Hannibal says. He puts the spoon down, and then fusses with the collar of Will\u2019s jacket before smoothing the shoulder seams.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019m just going to take this off again to change, right?\u201d Will asks. The last time he stood with Hannibal this close, face to face, Hannibal had a knife in his hand.</p>\n<p>Will knows he should feel frightened, or anxious, or angry. He doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will go quite nicely with the ensemble I\u2019ve selected for you. It\u2019s just as becoming with your coloring as I\u2019d hoped,\u201d Hannibal says, and his fingers slide through the curls at Will\u2019s nape before he cups Will\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you had me kidnapped just to play dress up, I\u2019m going to be pissed,\u201d Will says, and his breath stutters as Hannibal brushes his thumb over Will\u2019s cheekbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cDear Will,\u201d Hannibal murmurs. \u201cIt would be reason enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, fuck you,\u201d Will murmurs back, far too tenderly.</p>\n<p>The moment is broken by the sound of the front door opening, and Chiyoh\u2019s voice calling out a greeting. There are footsteps in the hall before the kitchen door slides open. It\u2019s Chiyoh and Abigail, bearing reusable bags full of groceries, and Will is a little chagrined at his disappointment in being interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cPut those on the table, please, and I\u2019ll put them away.\u201d He squeezes Will\u2019s nape once and says, \u201cGo wash up and change. Lunch will be ready shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will feels like he\u2019s doing some weird version of the walk of shame when he sidles past Abigail and Chiyoh, like Hannibal feeding him and manhandling him is something akin to second base.</p>\n<p>If it is, he reflects, they\u2019ve been stuck on it all this time.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Apparently, Hannibal intends for Will to continue freeballing, because no underwear is included in the outfit he\u2019s left for Will. The robe also looks less casual, and it\u2019s not made out of cotton. There are butterflies embroidered on it, for fuck\u2019s sake, and there\u2019s no way that\u2019s a coincidence. Hannibal\u2019s never met the metaphor he didn\u2019t want to bludgeon to death.</p>\n<p>He sighs and pulls it on. The silk slides against his dick and balls with a torturous whisper, and he mutters, \u201cGoddammit, Hannibal.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls the wool jacket on again before stepping into his slippers and heading back into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>When he slides open the kitchen door, Abigail and Chiyoh are seated at the table. Abigail gives him a once over and tries to hide a smile and fails; Chiyoh\u2019s expression is one of mild distaste.</p>\n<p>Hannibal turns around with two bowls in his hands and goes still, devouring Will with his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to do a twirl?\u201d Will says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to sit down and eat more than half of this,\u201d Hannibal says, putting the bowls in front of Chiyoh and Abigail. It\u2019s ramen, with the tonkotsu broth he tasted earlier, and very attractively presented.</p>\n<p>The bowl he puts down in front of Will is not exactly the same -- no raw vegetables, but he gets an extra soft-boiled egg, and the chashu pork is chopped into small pieces. It feels vaguely like being a toddler, but he\u2019s just happy he gets to have chashu at all.</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s treated to the unexpected joy of watching Hannibal Lector stuff his mouth with noodles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHot noodles wait for no one,\u201d Hannibal advises, and points his chopsticks at Will. \u201cEat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will does as he says, and it\u2019s as delicious as Hannibal\u2019s food always is, though Hannibal cops to using store-bought fresh noodles because there are some limits even to his repertoire.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we close to town, then?\u201d Will asks. All he can see out the windows is a forest of cedar trees.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cWe\u2019re a little further up the mountain. This villa was designed as a summer retreat -- few remain year round.\u201d</p>\n<p>In other words: few people to notice the house\u2019s occupancy, and even if they did, the population is transient enough that their presence would not necessarily draw attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you just have a random safe house in Japan?\u201d Will asks. Hannibal shoots him a look, and Will obediently puts more noodles in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt belonged to my aunt,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cChiyoh has served as its caretaker.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t exactly explain to Will who Chiyoh is and why she smuggled him out of the hospital and the country. When he lets himself look, though, he sees love -- a love that bound Chiyoh\u2019s loyalty to Hannibal, long after his aunt died. And she is most certainly dead; now that he knows where to look, he can see the ghost of grief clinging to Chiyoh, still.</p>\n<p>Will makes a valiant attempt to finish his bowl, and Hannibal\u2019s approving look warms him more than he cares to admit.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The doctors told him that recovery would be slow -- it\u2019s not just the skin that has to heal, it\u2019s the abdominal wall and muscles and intestines. He\u2019s spent a lot of time sleeping and expects that he\u2019ll continue to do so, whether he likes it or not.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is gracious enough to share his tablet with Will when he gets bored of Japanese daytime TV, which is fairly quickly. But because Hannibal is, well, Hannibal, of course when Will turns the tablet on, Tattlecrime is open in the first tab.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Will says from his futon in the living room, where he\u2019s propped up on pillows.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is in the kitchen making tea, and he looks like butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. \u201cI like to stay informed on current events.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like to stalk me even when I\u2019m with you,\u201d Will retorts, but starts scrolling through the article on the mysterious disappearance of one Will Graham from his hospital bed. Chiyoh really must have been careful, because Freddie doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to work with -- there are a few screenshots from hospital security cameras of Will in a wheelchair, but nothing of Chiyoh\u2019s face, and Freddie doesn\u2019t know who she is or where they went. Freddie\u2019s never been overly burdened by an absence of facts, though, and unfortunately, Will was on even better drugs in the hospital and said a lot of shit.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Could it be that Graham, heart longing for his would-be murderer, engineered his own escape?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an ocean away and I still want to strangle her,\u201d Will mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you had actually killed her, that wouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d Hannibal says, as if he\u2019s chiding Will for forgetting to pick up something from the store. He hands Will a cup of tea and sits cross-legged next to Will\u2019s futon.</p>\n<p>Will looks at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d he says carefully, because he needs to make that clear now. Will has crossed a lot of lines in his pursuit of Hannibal, but he won\u2019t be Hannibal\u2019s partner in murder, not the way Hannibal seems to want. \u201cFor one thing, who else would flatter your ego?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal sniffs, but instead of engaging the argument in front of them -- and they\u2019re going to have it some time, Will is certain -- he says, \u201cMs. Lounds takes many liberties. That does not mean she does not occasionally arrive at the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike when,\u201d Will scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe refers to us as \u2018murder husbands.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Will narrows his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear how you think that qualifies as the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cWe are married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell we are,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal takes a sip of his own cup of tea. \u201cMy intention was for us to be a family. It seemed prudent to have a marriage certificate made up in addition to our passports.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what, we\u2019re Mr. and Mr. Anders?\u201d Will says incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI considered hyphenating but decided against it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Will says sardonically. \u201cYou put all that thought into it and I didn\u2019t even get a proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked you to come away with me,\u201d Hannibal reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even a ring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill--\u201d Hannibal starts, looking dismayed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I hate to break it to you, but our wedding night wasn\u2019t anything to write home about if I can\u2019t remember it,\u201d Will continues ruthlessly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyes narrow minutely, which suggests Will is going to hear a rebuttal to that shortly. But first he takes Will\u2019s hand, and says, \u201cI had a ring for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The tension between them tightens abruptly. Some of that is Hannibal holding his hand like he\u2019s something precious. Some of it is the stab of <i>want</i> that hits Will -- well, not precisely in the gut, because he knows what that feels like -- but somewhere tender, because even after everything, Hannibal still knows him best, and Will feels more alive with him than without.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you leave it in Baltimore?\u201d Will asks, and feels the corners of his lips twitch into a smile when he sees the vaguely discomfited look on Hannibal\u2019s face. \u201cOh no, you -- what, left it on train tracks? Threw it into the ocean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dropped it into the donation box of a shrine,\u201d Hannibal admits. \u201cWhere one typically leaves small change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Will says again. He should never have underestimated Hannibal\u2019s capacity for dramatic burns.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no consequence. It would be unsuitable for the present circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will squints at him. \u201cUnsuitable how?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s hand is still warm around his, his thumb stroking Will\u2019s knuckles. \u201cIt was a wedding band, and rather plain. You\u2019ve asked me for a proposal, which necessitates a different ring altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo it does not, and I did not ask you for a proposal, I was pointing out that it\u2019s <i>customary</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDear Will,\u201d Hannibal says, and he looks at Will like Will is everything, absolutely everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t even kissed,\u201d Will snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow remiss of me,\u201d Hannibal says, and takes Will\u2019s face in his hands and leans down. Will can\u2019t lean up, he can only wait, half-seconds feeling like hours until Hannibal\u2019s lips touch his. Hannibal kisses him gently, like he thinks Will is going to object -- and instead, Will gets a handful of Hannibal\u2019s hair and pulls him closer and holds him there, exactly where he\u2019s wanted him.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I even surprised?\u201d Will mutters to himself. Instead of two single futons laid out side by side in the bedroom, there\u2019s a big one, clearly meant for two.</p>\n<p>Hannibal comes in a few minutes later, dressed in his pajamas. Actual pajamas, not Will\u2019s usual t-shirt and shorts. He\u2019s also carrying his medical kit. \u201cI\u2019ll want to have a look before you change for bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou let me sleep in the robe the other night,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cA cotton yukata is acceptable for sleeping. That kimono is not,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>Will closes his eyes. \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t an antique.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDishonesty is no way to start a marriage,\u201d Hannibal says lightly, kneeling at Will\u2019s feet. He gently parts the top of the kimono and slides it down off Will\u2019s shoulders, leaving it to hang over the sash at his waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really not that kind of boy,\u201d Will tells him. </p>\n<p>Hannibal lets out a small amused huff. \u201cWill, the very last thing anyone could accuse you of is being <i>easy</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, as long as we\u2019re clear about that,\u201d Will says, and Hannibal rewards him with a little smile that Will can\u2019t help but return. </p>\n<p>Hannibal unwinds the gauze wrap, then cleans the wound area carefully before redressing it. Then he goes to the closet and slides open the door, and brings Will a folded yukata, this one a pale watery blue with a geometric print.</p>\n<p>Still no underwear on offer, Will notes. He\u2019ll insist tomorrow -- if Hannibal wants to dress him in fancy clothes, that\u2019s fine, but Will draws the line at spending another day with silk rubbing against his junk all day long.</p>\n<p>When he returns from the bathroom, Hannibal is on one side of the futon with a book in hand. Will\u2019s magazines and book from the plane ride are on the other side, and the comforter is flipped open for him. Hannibal gets up to help lower him into bed, and then pulls the comforter up and over him, and it feels really nice to have someone other than a nurse tuck him in.</p>\n<p>He means to pick up the fishing magazine again, but he\u2019s had a long day of napping and Hannibal and that seems like more than enough for one day. His eyes fall shut, and at some point, Hannibal turns off the light. He\u2019s mostly asleep when Hannibal finds his hand under the covers and laces their fingers together.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Before he knows it, a week has passed. Chiyoh disappears for long stretches of time, appearing only occasionally for meals. Will spends more time in one of the floor chairs that has an adjustable back than in his futon. Hannibal kisses him good morning and good night, and sneaks in few more when they\u2019re alone in kitchen. Will and Abigail develop a game they call, \u201cWhat product is this commercial for?\u201d They are almost never right.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s kimono du jour is dark red with white cranes in flight. Hannibal did give him underwear when asked -- unfortunately, Will should have been more specific in his request, because the underwear Hannibal provides is on the slutty side and no less distracting than when he was going commando.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour thoughts on this one?\u201d Hannibal asks, handing Will his tablet. It\u2019s another listing for an apartment in Paris.</p>\n<p>Will peruses the photo gallery; his French is limited to English cognates and remnants of Louisiana Creole, which is better than nothing but not by much, so the text description is less than helpful to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rent is insane,\u201d he tells Hannibal, because numbers don\u2019t require translation.</p>\n<p>\u201cLocation, location,\u201d Hannibal says in a genial lament.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you want to be in the city?\u201d Will asks. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be -- safer, to be out in the country?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExpatriates are everywhere in Paris,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cAnd I should like for Abigail to live at home with us while attending university.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut daddy, what about the full college experience?\u201d Will asks, and bats his eyelashes obnoxiously.</p>\n<p>Hannibal takes in a short breath; it\u2019s a stutter, a blip in his norm presentation.</p>\n<p>But if Will couldn\u2019t put two and two together and get nascent daddy kink, he arguably wouldn\u2019t be where he is today. He wonders if Hannibal has always had a taste for it, or if it\u2019s born purely of his obsession with Will.</p>\n<p>Whichever way it is, he\u2019s not above using it to get what he wants, if necessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a place on the outskirts of the city,\u201d Will says. \u201cAbigail can come home on the weekends -- she needs room to become an adult, and she can\u2019t do it with the both of us hovering. You\u2019ll have to give up at least that much control.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal purses his lips in thought. \u201cYou\u2019d have me give up more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo killing for the first year,\u201d Will says, and gives him a hard look. \u201cYou won\u2019t endanger our family\u2019s safety like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cDo you think me so careless as to get caught?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re looking for you now -- for us,\u201d Will says, leaning hard on their new plurality. \u201cThere will be more scrutiny than you\u2019re used to. What good does it do to get Abigail into school if she just has to leave immediately?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal is silent, but he takes Will\u2019s hand. He\u2019s been doing that a lot over the last week -- before bed, during short walks around the house, while sitting together in the living room as they are right now. \u201cIs this the price of your love, Will?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Will says steadily. \u201cIt\u2019s the price of my company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks him in the eye. \u201cAnd after the first year? How far does this companionship extend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat your food, no matter how your meat is sourced. But you promise me you\u2019ll be careful about how you -- acquire it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I wish to acquire it with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you that,\u201d Will says. Hannibal\u2019s hand tightens around his.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you do not discount the possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m saying maybe, but if so, on rare occasions,\u201d Will says, because the truth is that he really doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s something he wants, and as Hannibal said -- dishonesty was no way to start a marriage.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think this is a price I should pay,\u201d Hannibal says quietly, thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you want me to break both our hearts and leave, yes.\u201d The threat sounds suitably convincing to his own ears, and he feels the ache of that possible separation, bone-deep and painful.</p>\n<p>Hannibal pulls Will into his arms and holds him close. His warmth sinks into Will\u2019s skin, and the light scent of his aftershave fills Will\u2019s nose, and his fingertips brush the stitches binding the skin he sundered.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The cedar woods surrounding the villa hide the rest of the world away. Or at least, as much of the world as Will can venture to see, which isn\u2019t much at the moment.</p>\n<p>Abigail surprises him by offering to accompany him for a morning walk outside. He\u2019s been mostly confined to shuffling around the house, but he thinks a walk outdoors would do him good. He can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s going a little stir crazy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go just to the foxes and then we\u2019ll come back,\u201d Abigail assures Hannibal.</p>\n<p>Hannibal finishes hanging up a dish towel, and then centers it neatly. Will feels something treacherous and dumb in his heart at the sight, which probably proves that he\u2019s lost his mind after all. \u201cYou will call if you need me,\u201d Hannibal says, and then presses a kiss to the top of Abigail\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>Of course, Hannibal does not allow Will to step foot outside in just his yukata. \u201cI have a vested interest in your extremities,\u201d he says, while bundling Will into a fucking fur coat like Will is some kind of mob wife.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s either disturbing or kinky or both,\u201d Will tells him.</p>\n<p>Hannibal just smiles at him and picks up his hand to press a kiss to Will\u2019s knuckles, and then to his fingertips. \u201cHave a nice walk. Abigail, please don\u2019t let him overdo it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d she says, and then carefully ushers Will out the back door into the forest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are the foxes?\u201d Will asks as they make their way slowly down a dirt path.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re part of a little shrine up ahead. It\u2019s not very far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods, and concentrates on putting one foot in front of another, and holds on to Abigail\u2019s arm for extra support. The scent of the cedar trees fills his nose; it\u2019s a grey day, and what light there is has a hard time penetrating the woods.</p>\n<p>He might have missed the shrine altogether if Abigail hadn\u2019t stopped him. \u201cLook up there,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>There are rough stone steps up the hill, leading to a tiny shrine flanked by two fox statues. The foxes\u2019 tails and ears are tipped with moss, and the wood of the shrine looks grey and weathered. At the front of the shrine is a satsuma, like the ones that sit in a bowl in Hannibal\u2019s kitchen.</p>\n<p>Will sits down on one of the steps, and Abigail squeezes in next to him. \u201cYou come here a lot,\u201d he says, and he doesn\u2019t need the swing of the pendulum behind his eyes to know it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d she says. \u201cChiyoh showed me. It\u2019s a good place to think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Abigail is quiet for a moment. \u201cI think about what happened. What\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to happen next?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>She shrugs, and Will waits. Eventually, she says, \u201cI want us to be a family. To be together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>She leans into him. He hesitates, and then wraps an arm around her shoulder. \u201cHe cut you open and left you,\u201d she says, voice low.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says, and sighs. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit there for a while longer. Then Abigail says, \u201cSometimes at night, you can see lights in a line far away, moving slowly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoving?\u201d</p>\n<p>Abigail nods. \u201cChiyoh says it\u2019s the fox's wedding. A procession.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will imagines it, a line of paper lanterns in the dark. He shivers and looks back over his shoulder at the two fox statues. They don\u2019t look tame.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to head back,\u201d he says, and Abigail gives him a hand up.</p>\n<p>Later that evening at twilight, Hannibal accompanies him back out to the shrine at his request. He leans a little more heavily on Hannibal\u2019s arm than he did on Abigail\u2019s -- the earlier walk took more out of him than he expected.</p>\n<p>When they get to the shrine, the satsuma that was there earlier is gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there foxes in the woods here? Real ones, I mean,\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Hannibal frowns thoughtfully. \u201cI saw one once, when I first visited as a young man. It would not surprise me if there were more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will fishes the satsuma he\u2019d brought with him out of his coat pocket. \u201cWill you help me up the steps?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>They take it slow -- the stone steps are uneven, and there\u2019s no railing. When they get to the top, Will takes a moment to catch his breath before moving forward. \u201cHow do I do this?\u201d he asks, holding the satsuma uncertainly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlace your offering there,\u201d Hannibal says, indicating the small altar above a wooden offering box. Will does so, making sure it\u2019s not liable to roll off. \u201cThen you\u2019ll ring the bell, bow twice, clap twice, and then pray and bow once more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes a deep breath, then pulls the small rope that jangles a small bell, bows twice without accidentally taking a header, claps twice, and then pauses. \u201cWhat are you supposed to pray for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in your heart,\u201d Hannibal says simply.</p>\n<p>Will closes his eyes, and thinks. He\u2019s a long way away from churches of his childhood, a long way from the Catholic Masses of New Orleans. As far as he\u2019s been able to tell, praying has never gotten him anywhere. He wonders what Hannibal prays for.</p>\n<p>He opens his eyes again and bows. The light of the day is nearly gone, but something catches his eye in the wooden offering box with its slatted top.</p>\n<p>There are two gold wedding bands among the coins.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Will says, and before Hannibal can start them down the steps, Will kisses him and clutches him close like he\u2019ll never let him go.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A few nights later, Hannibal decides it\u2019s time for the stitches to come out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very calm,\u201d Hannibal observes as he snips the ends and begins to pull the thread out. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can handle this part,\u201d Will says dryly. \u201cIn your sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something weirdly mesmerizing about Hannibal\u2019s clinical touch -- he moves with such surety and efficiency, and in seemingly no time at all, the stitches are all removed, and Hannibal is cleaning the site gently before removing his gloves.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to give me discharge instructions?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s half-joking, but Hannibal looks serious as he says, \u201cWe can increase the length of your walks outside, but you shouldn\u2019t lift anything over five pounds for several more weeks. We can continue to advance you to a normal diet, and decrease your opioid intake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to warn you right now about how not fun that is going to be for anyone,\u201d Will says, but on the whole, it sounds like he\u2019s making good progress.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbigail and I will support you, Will,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI have every confidence that you will continue to make a good recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying I\u2019m probably going to be a jerk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Hannibal says, looking far more pleased about the prospect than he should.</p>\n<p>Will is lying on his futon in an open yukata in what he\u2019s sure is some pretty expensive underwear. \u201cCan we have sex now?\u201d he asks, because he\u2019s human and Hannibal has refused to move things further along than necking.</p>\n<p>Hannibal gives him a arch look. \u201cI think I can see my way toward clearing you for resumption of sexual activity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have conditions?\u201d Will asks, but he almost doesn\u2019t care what they are, because seriously, Hannibal has been tormenting him.</p>\n<p>Hannibal strokes one finger carefully along Will\u2019s neck, across a franky ridiculous hickey that is only partially hidden by the collar of his yukata. \u201cI would advise any patient to engage in sexual activity during recovery with care. In your case, I think we should be quite cautious and proceed slowly so as to not set back your recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that sounds annoyingly reasonable,\" Will says. He squirms a little under the heavy, greedy weight of Hannibal\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>Hannibal leans over him on all fours, planting his hands on either side of Will\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI think it\u2019s best if you lie there and take exactly what I give you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re going to give me <i>something</i>,\u201d Will says, because he is older and theoretically wiser but probably always going to be prone to mouthing off. \u201cSo far this has been kind of a shitty honeymoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you might find the location romantic,\u201d Hannibal murmurs, just a hint of a smile at the corners of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is actually wrong with you?\u201d Will asks, and then pulls Hannibal down into a kiss. It starts off as slow and sweet as all the rest, until Will gets impatient and the kiss gets more desperate as he starts tugging at Hannibal\u2019s sweater.</p>\n<p>But Hannibal wasn\u2019t kidding about restraint -- he traps the sleeves of Will\u2019s yukata against the futon with his forearms, and says, \u201cGently, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m already mostly naked -- is there some reason you can\u2019t be, too?\u201d Will retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll in good time, darling boy,\u201d Hannibal murmurs against his throat, and okay, fine -- that works for Will, and he\u2019s a little mad about it how well it works, but he doesn\u2019t exactly care right now because Hannibal is sucking a line of kisses down to the horrendous love bite he made yesterday, while his fingers flirt with the waistband of Will\u2019s slutty briefs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I come on your sweater, you\u2019ve got no one to blame but yourself,\u201d Will says, and then gasps when Hannibal nips at his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to be so wasteful,\u201d Hannibal says, and pulls back enough to look Will in the eye. \u201cI intend to savor you, down to the last drop.\u201d</p>\n<p>That definitely shouldn\u2019t work for Will either, but he doesn\u2019t have time to be mad about it because Hannibal is making his way down Will\u2019s body, lingering at his nipples before kissing down his sternum. He avoids the raw, tender pink of the scar he made, and slides Will\u2019s underwear off, but not all the way. Will sees suddenly that he\u2019s Hannibal\u2019s new tableau, the low light of a lamp casting shadows and illuminating the ways in which Will is arranged for Hannibal\u2019s aesthetic pleasure, selectively exposed by the yukata that contrasts with his skin, the elastic of his briefs tucked under his balls so that they\u2019re pushed up, so that they\u2019re displayed along with the hard line of his cock, all for only Hannibal to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you just going to look?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be enough,\u201d Hannibal says, voice rough with emotion, and oh hell -- he means it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for me,\u201d Will says. \u201cIf it were, Freddie\u2019s readership and I would be very happy together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyes go dark; it wasn\u2019t a very subtle prod, but Hannibal\u2019s operatic feelings don\u2019t seem to need it where Will is concerned, and some part of Will <i>likes</i> that, likes that whatever he makes Hannibal feel is so beyond his ability to control, pure and honest and more than a little fucking crazy.</p>\n<p>Hannibal slides his underwear all the way off and then finally touches him, giving his dick a few strokes before holding it at the base and leaning down to lick at the head slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Will breathes when Hannibal looks up at him as he finally takes Will into his mouth. His nerves feel all mixed up, too accustomed to pain and suddenly flooded with endorphins. He struggles to cope with how good it feels to have Hannibal work him with his lips and tongue; he feels high on what he sees in Hannibal\u2019s eyes, possessiveness and desire and searing, sharp adoration.</p>\n<p>His balls are tight when Hannibal rubs them gently, and Will wants to buck up in his mouth but Hannibal\u2019s forearm is laid firmly across his hips, so that he has no choice but to do what Hannibal said and take what he\u2019s given. In Hannibal\u2019s defense, what he\u2019s serving up is really good -- his mouth is warm and he takes Will deep, sucks him like he\u2019s starving for it, and when Will gasps and swears and says, \u201cFuck -- I\u2019m gonna--\u201d Hannibal swallows him down, throat working and gaze blissful.</p>\n<p>Will lies there, panting for breath, and he can hear Hannibal do the same. He feels wrung out, pleasantly exhausted, but he\u2019s not in the habit of being selfish in bed and has no intention of leaving Hannibal hanging. He pulls at Hannibal\u2019s sweater and says, \u201cCome here,\u201d and Hannibal obliges. \u201cWhy are you still dressed?\u201d Will complains, giving up the sweater as a lost cause and going for Hannibal\u2019s belt. He pushes Hannibal to lie on his back and finally gets his pants and underwear out of the way, and then swings one leg over Hannibal\u2019s thighs to straddle him. He\u2019s hampered by the fact that he\u2019s nearly trembling with exhaustion, but he can make this good. His rumpled yukata hangs open, and he licks his hand while Hannibal watches and then starts to jerk Hannibal off. Will likes the heft of Hannibal\u2019s dick in his hands and how Hannibal can\u2019t look away, the small gasps and sounds as Will works him over, precome and spit making everything slick.</p>\n<p>That being said, Will kind of needs Hannibal to wrap this up before he falls over, so he decides he may as well go for it. He strokes Hannibal a little firmer, a little faster, playing with the unfamiliar foreskin before he murmurs, \u201cCome on, daddy, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal arches up into Will\u2019s hand for a few short thrusts and then comes hard, all over his own stomach. Will collapses against Hannibal\u2019s side, and luxuriates in Hannibal petting his hair rather unsteadily. And because Will basically can\u2019t help himself, he says, \u201cWas it good for you too, daddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWretched boy,\u201d Hannibal mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d Will says lightly.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and then Hannibal says, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They stay another month, until Will is recovered enough to travel without needing a wheelchair. Hannibal packs away the yukata and kimono, although Will feels reasonably sure that a select few are going to mysteriously appear in his wardrobe in their little house outside of Paris.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing that mob wife coat in public,\u201d Will warns Hannibal.</p>\n<p>Hannibal sighs, like Will is such a trial; Abigail says, \u201cCan I have it, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>That kicks off a whole discussion about fit and proportion that Will tunes out in favor of making sure the kerosene heater in the kitchen can be safely stored away. Chiyoh isn\u2019t coming with them, and she\u2019s not staying here, so they\u2019re closing the house up in earnest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill we come back?\u201d Will asks Hannibal as he packs their luggage. Will offered to help, but wasn\u2019t surprised to have Hannibal tell him he was welcome to keep Hannibal company but forbidden to touch anything or offer opinions on optimal packing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should like to,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cKyoto in cherry blossom season is not to be missed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant back to this house,\u201d Will says. He rests one hand on the smooth wood of the doorway, old and well-cared for. \u201cI like it here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d Hannibal closes the suitcase and rises to his feet. \u201cI\u2019d be pleased if you would allow me to make a wedding gift of it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a whole vacation house,\u201d Will protests. \u201cAnd anyway, you still haven\u2019t asked me to marry you.\u201d It\u2019s been his refrain for a month, because Hannibal, in fact, has done everything but that -- he\u2019s booked a French chapel and pestered Will about flowers and cake and color schemes. Abigail is getting a new dress, and Will doesn\u2019t know what his suit is going to look like, but if he knows Hannibal, it will look good.</p>\n<p>Abigail calls down the hall for Hannibal then, and Hannibal excuses himself to assist her, leaving Will at loose ends. They\u2019re leaving for the airport in the morning, and Will thinks that he really is going to miss this place. He goes out to the veranda off their bedroom that winds around the back of the house; the moon is bright, and it\u2019s not as chilly as it was.</p>\n<p>When Chiyoh\u2019s voice comes, it startles him. \u201cYou\u2019re going with them, then,\u201d she says quietly.</p>\n<p>Will nods slowly. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chiyoh gives the barest suggestion of a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, and sounds surprised by that turn of events.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Will tells her. \u201cAnd thanks for kidnapping me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re very strange,\u201d she tells him, and disappears back into the house.</p>\n<p>Hannibal joins him shortly on the veranda, a bottle of sake and two cups in hand. He also has Will\u2019s wool jacket, which of course turned out to be designer haori that Will is also not going wear in public, but it is very warm and comfortable and he\u2019s glad to have it now.</p>\n<p>They sit with their legs over the edge of the veranda, the cedar woods surrounding them, lit by the moon. Will picks up the decanter to pour, and then stops when he realizes there\u2019s something in his cup. The ring glints in the moonlight, and it\u2019s hard to make all the detail out, but it\u2019s inlaid with something that sparkles discreetly. Positively restrained, for Hannibal.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this where I ask if you\u2019re going to make an honest man out of me?\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs much as I enjoy living in sin with you, I would much rather never be parted from you again,\u201d Hannibal says. </p>\n<p>Will looks down at the ring. \u201cIs this the price of your company?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI will pay yours and consider it well spent, but I would be with you, married or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will slides on the ring and pulls Hannibal in for a kiss, slow and tender. \u201cMarry me,\u201d Will whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cDear Will, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Over Hannibal\u2019s shoulder, he thinks he can see something in the dark, like a train of lights. Will closes his eyes, and prays.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
