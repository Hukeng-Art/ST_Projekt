  "text": "<p>It started on a warm summer afternoon, when Izuku and Katsuki were five years old, lying side by side in the shade of a ginkgo tree in their favorite park. The midday sun filtered through the green leaves above them as the rustled softly in the slight breeze, casting a dappled light on all below them. Izuku squinted up through the green to catch a glimpse of sparse clouds in the bright blue sky, trying to make out a shape. Katsuki counted the leaves he saw on each branch above him, wishing their mothers would have let them get ice cream. </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever heard someone say\u2026\u2019a penny for your thoughts\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I have.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki sat up and glared down at his friend. \u201cStupid Deku. It means you want a penny for someone\u2019s thoughts, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku frowned up at him. \u201cLike, a real penny?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDuh!\u201d Katsuki threw a leaf at Izuku\u2019s face, and he giggled and sent it back into the air with a puff. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, if I give you penny, you have to tell me your thoughts?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki rummaged a hand through his tiny pockets and grabbed a spare coin, then held it up above Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cYes.\u201d He dropped the penny, and it landed on Izuku\u2019s nose and slid onto his freckled cheek. \u201cNow tell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he ordered. </p>\n<p>Izuku grabbed the penny of his cheek and sat up, beaming. \u201cI was thinking that Kacchan is so smart!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I am! What a dumb thought, stupid Deku.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku held the penny back out to him. \u201cHere, now you tell me yours.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give that to me!\u201d Katsuki protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI just gave it to you!\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku shrugged and kept holding out the penny for Katsuki to take. \u201cThat means it\u2019s mine. So now, I give it to you for <em>your</em> thoughts.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki huffed and snatched the penny out of Izuku\u2019s outstretched hand. \u201cDeku\u2019s a dummy, he\u2019s lucky has me around to tell him stuff.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku still smiled brightly. \u201cI am lucky to have you, Kacchan!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the next few years, that\u2019s how it went. Izuku and Katsuki would give each other the penny at random times, and the receiver always had to say whatever they were thinking out loud. Katsuki gave Izuku the penny while they were buying candy, and Izuku said he wished Katsuki would share more. Izuku gave Katsuki the penny while they were being chewed out for getting the floor all muddy, and Katsuki was forced to tell his mother he thought she was being stupid \u2013 that one earned Katsuki a day of room isolation and Izuku a wrestling match. Katsuki gave Izuku the penny in the middle of recess, making Izuku tell the whole class that he had an underwear wedgie, blushing furiously as Katsuki cackled. </p>\n<p>No matter the thought, no matter the time or place, the boys staunchly refused to lie about their thoughts. It was always the truth. Because that\u2019s the way it went. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometime around sixth grade, Katsuki didn\u2019t give the penny back to Izuku. The last time he\u2019d tossed it to Katsuki, Katsuki had snatched it from the air, pocketed it, glared at Izuku, and told him that he was \u201ctired of stupid Deku following him around like a useless puppy who thought he could do something.\u201d He kept it all of middle school and through their first year at UA, by which time Izuku had given up on ever getting it back. He assumed Katsuki threw the penny away, or spent it, or forgot about it. </p>\n<p>What he didn\u2019t expect was to hear a familiar, rough voice call \u201cDeku\u201d as he did his homework at a common room table, and look up to see a small bronze coin flying at his face, barely reacting fast enough to catch it. He opened his hand and held it flat in front of him, staring at the old, rusty penny resting on his scarred palm. When he looked up, Katsuki was watching him expectantly, with one eyebrow quirked up. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Izuku started, then cleared his throat nervously. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot the negative sign for the third problem in a row.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki scoffed. \u201cIdiot.\u201d He shoved his hands into his sweatpants pockets and turned around, walking away like he hadn\u2019t just done that for the first time in half a decade. Izuku couldn\u2019t help a small grin as he slipped the penny in his own pocket and got back to his math. It was definitely the same penny as all those years ago. Katsuki had kept it. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku gave the penny back the next time they were alone, thinking that Katsuki might not play along in front of their classmates. That happened to be when they were both on dish duty for the night, and Izuku tossed the penny at Katsuki after he dried his hands on a towel. Katsuki caught it easily, then met Izuku\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cStupid fucking extras never do the dishes right, and they know Deku and I are the only ones who don\u2019t leave soap suds behind.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku smiled. \u201cGuess that\u2019s why we get this job the most.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d Katsuki grumbled, then stalked out of the kitchen as Izuku giggled behind him. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki threw the penny to Izuku as they sat on the ground and leaned up against the wall of the school after a common pre-sunset sparring match. Izuku caught it, then took a swig from his water bottle before answering. </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan\u2019s got really good moves lately,\u201d he said, \u201cand he keeps being so inventive with them. I need to analyze both of us better if I want to surpass him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki rolled his eyes. \u201cNever going to fucking happen, nerd.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJust you wait,\u201d Izuku shot back, leaning further into the wall and watching the colors of the sun bleed into night above silhouetted trees. Katsuki must have been just as worn out, because he didn\u2019t respond. When Izuku turned to look at him, his expression was unreadable, so Izuku dropped the penny back on his lap. </p>\n<p>Katsuki glared at it for a second, then put it in his pocket. He focused on the trees, not meeting Izuku\u2019s eyes. \u201cDeku\u2019s an idiot if he thinks he couldn\u2019t be just as good as I am.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku blinked at him in surprise as Katsuki continued to not look at him, then broke into a grin. \u201cThanks, Kacchan!\u201d Katsuki just grumbled and chugged his water. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019S a good idea to analyze yourself, Deku,\u201d Katsuki said eventually, startling Izuku a bit. \u201cYou can\u2019t get better just stalking other people with your creepy notebooks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalking!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aboso-fucking-lutley are.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next penny transfer was right after breakfast, when Izuku was talking with Todoroki and Uraraka about an assignment that was due that day. Katsuki came right up next to them and threw the penny at him, then stood there, waiting for him to answer. Apparently, Katsuki didn\u2019t care who saw them play this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder if I could finish my worksheet in homeroom before Midnight-sensei collects it,\u201d Izuku admitted, sighing. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you finish it last night?\u201d Katsuki snapped. </p>\n<p>\u201cStayed up too late training.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki scowled at him. \u201cIdiot.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Kacchan.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki just huffed and left, while Todoroki and Uraraka stared at Izuku, confused. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Uraraka asked. </p>\n<p>Izuku waved a hand. \u201cNothing.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t explain, but he didn\u2019t. Maybe a small part of him liked the feeling of having an inside joke or game between just him and Katsuki. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He decided the do the same thing Katsuki had done, walking up to his lunch table as Katsuki sat, tucked in the corner of the booth and watched his chattering friends with a bored expression. </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d he called, making the other boy look up before tossing him the coin.</p>\n<p>Katsuki caught it with one hand and swallowed whatever food he was eating. \u201cI need to ask Deku for Aunty Inko\u2019s curry recipe. Lunch Rush\u2019s stuff is a little off and I can never get it right on my own.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku grinned at him. \u201cMy mom does make the best stuff, doesn\u2019t she? I\u2019ll text her later.\u201d Katsuki barely acknowledged his response, turning back to his bowl of curry and ignoring all his friends who had stopped talking and started staring at the two of them. Izuku just shrugged and left, stifling a giggle as he heard Katsuki\u2019s friends burst into questions. He couldn\u2019t hold back when he heard Katsuki start yelling at them, though. </p>\n<p>Later that evening, he copied the recipe his mom happily sent him in a text message to Katsuki. The response was \u201cfucking finally\u201d, which made him smile again. He let Katsuki know that his mother wanted a picture whenever he made it. Katsuki said he\u2019d send one. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day after quirk training at Gym Gamma, Katsuki returned the penny. Izuku was so deep in thought he didn\u2019t notice Katsuki come up to him until his hand was lifted up and the penny was pressed into his gloved palm. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d he squeaked, looking up. \u201cKacchan\u2019s got such good balance in the air when he\u2019s using his blasts to fly, I wonder how long that took to master and if I could factor the methods into my fighting.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou already have Float, why the fuck do you need balance for flight?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBalance is important for everything, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku said, smiling. \u201cLearning that balance from a young age in order to fly is probably how you can move so fast! Your reflexes are top notch, and you\u2019re not gonna fall over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki scratched his chin, pinching his brows together. \u201cI guess.\u201d He broke into his competitive grin that recently seemed to make Izuku\u2019s heart flutter. \u201cJust another thing you gotta catch up with, nerd.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI plan on it, Kacchan.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They continued like this for months. </p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima\u2019s smart enough to pull this off, he\u2019s just gotta get his head out of his ass and focus.\u201d (\u201cAw, thanks Bakubro!\u201d \u201cI said you need to fucking focus, Shitty Hair.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I make a lot of miso soup right now, I can store it in the fridge and have breakfast for the next few days.\u201d (\u201cYou are so fucking boring, Deku.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hungry!\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cLearning these dates are so fucking useless. Pro heroes don\u2019t need to know shit about pre-quirk era politics.\u201d (Izuku responded with a 2-minute lecture on the importance of history before Katsuki threw a handful of pens at him). </p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei reminds me of a sleepy cat. So does Shinso.\u201d (\u201c\u2026Why does that make sense?\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder if Dunce Face would bounce if I shoved him down the stairs.\u201d (That was said right next to Kaminari himself). </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan still looks so cool when he uses his quirk, especially flying around.\u201d (\u201cShut up, nerd.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to get my shit together, Deku almost beat with me that stupid fake-out.\u201d (\u201cI did?\u201d \u201cI still won, idiot.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cI really wish Midnight-sensei would get rid of the whip in a classroom setting at the very least.\u201d (\u201cI hate to agree with you, but same.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was all going great. Izuku was elated to have this kind of thing back. And Katsuki seemed to enjoy it too, some thoughts coaxing a small smile out of him or leading to enjoyable conversations between them. But then, something horrible happened. </p>\n<p>The day began normal, no dark omens pointing Izuku to the mess he was going to get into later. The divine powers had failed him on that end. Instead of the flock of omen birds that should\u2019ve appeared to lock him in his room the whole day, he went about his morning without a care, wondering what he\u2019d learn in class today and whether or not he\u2019d done those problems correctly. </p>\n<p>All day at school, he chatted with his friends and took diligent notes. Eventually, the day ended, he finished his homework, and it was finally time to spar with Katsuki like he did every day. All Might wasn\u2019t coming because of a teacher meeting, and that was fine and normal, which is to say that if that was God\u2019s attempt at a warning, it did <em>not</em> work. Izuku arrived at the area in front of the gyms, dressed in workout gear and raring to go. </p>\n<p>Absolutely everything was normal, right up until their final match that ended with Katsuki on top of him as he lay on his back, pinning him to the ground. They were both panting hard, sweaty even in the cool late fall air. Katsuki\u2019s cheeks were flushed pink from exertion, the color only deepened by the pink and orange melting together in the slowly darkening sky. The light from the setting sun glinted off his triumphant, confident grin and sparkling vermillion eyes. </p>\n<p>His strikingly, insanely gorgeous eyes.</p>\n<p>Izuku felt his face go up in flame, far hotter than before, but he couldn\u2019t look away from the glittering pools of ruby red, like he was sinking into them. </p>\n<p>And then, to his mounting horror, a small coin dropped onto his chest as Katsuki\u2019s feral grin turned to a demanded question, one eyebrow raised. </p>\n<p>Izuku contemplated lying. He really did. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do that, not after so many years. It would feel like breaking a promise, even though they never promised out loud. So instead, he took a deep breath, grabbed the penny off his chest, and pushed Katsuki to the side, sitting up and keeping his eyes locked on the ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchanhasreallyprettyeyes,\u201d he blurted as fast as he could, scrambling to his feet and snagging of his water bottle before bolting from the scene, face burning and heart racing. </p>\n<p>By the time he reached the dorms, he felt like his heart was going to burst out of his chest, and he quickly made his way up to his room, mumbling little hellos to his classmates but keeping his head down. When he finally made it, he kicked the door shut behind him and flopped face-first onto his bed, burying his face in a pillow. </p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t get that image of Katsuki\u2019s face out of his head. Especially those eyes. Gah, what was wrong with him? First, why did he think that? And second, why did he get so flustered and run away like he\u2019d been set on fire when he told Katsuki? He could\u2019ve tried to play it off as an objective observation, because that\u2019s all it was: The objective observation that Katsuki\u2019s eyes looked like dazzling jewels.</p>\n<p>He groaned into his pillow with feeling, wishing he could just fall through the ground like Mirio-senpai and never return. He was never leaving his room again. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku eventually did have to leave his room an hour later, thanks to his rumbling stomach. He tried to sneak into the kitchen without being seen, but of course, Uraraka noticed and cornered him. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeku, is something wrong?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No! Why would anything be wrong?\u201d Izuku said, a little too fast. \u201cJust getting some dinner before I go back to studying! Man, school is hard, right?\u201d He forced a laugh, realizing he sounded insane and trying to calm down. </p>\n<p>Uraraka frowned at him deeply. \u201cWhen you came back from sparring, you didn\u2019t have Bakugou with you. Did something happen? Did he do something?\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes went wide and he waved his hands around. \u201cNo! No, Kacchan didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck are you talking about me?\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku squeaked in surprise as Katsuki came up behind Uraraka, looking almost bored with thumbs hooked in his pants pockets. He met Izuku\u2019s eyes and stared him down with the striking crimson, corner of his lips twitching up in the slightest of smirks. He was doing this on purpose, wasn\u2019t he? </p>\n<p>Izuku quickly broke the eye contact and stared to the side of Katsuki\u2019s shoulders. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo reason, Kacchan!\u201d He turned around to focus on getting some food together, and thankfully, neither Uraraka nor Katsuki bothered him anymore. He finished eating and ran back up to his room, slumping onto his bed and holding the rusted penny above his face, twisting it between his fingers. </p>\n<p>He was feeling very conflicted. On one hand, if he gave the penny back, then Katsuki would have another chance to catch him having those random heart-fluttering thoughts. On the other hand, if he never gave it back, he\u2019d ruin whatever they\u2019d been starting to build these past months. They\u2019d been repairing their friendship ever since Ground Beta in first year, but the penny felt like a new level of rebuilding. Less tentative and deep, more about a real, happy friendship like the one they used to have. The one where they were comfortable around each other and talked about anything and everything. The one where they had silly inside jokes and funny games with a penny.</p>\n<p>Izuku sighed, closing his fist around the coin and dropping his hand onto the pillow. He had to give it back. Maybe he could find a chance to embarrass Katsuki, though, as a bit of payback. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He found his moment almost a week later during a gym class. Instead of quirk training, they were focusing on building up physical strength and endurance with different exercises. Izuku had just finished his tenth set of weight repetitions when he caught Katsuki staring from his seat on the bench press a few feet away. He had a very weird look on his face, so Izuku figured he was lost in thought. </p>\n<p>As quickly as he could, Izuku fished the penny out of his gym shorts and tossed it at Katsuki. Katsuki jolted and clapped the penny between his palms, frowning at it. That was a good sign for something embarrassing. </p>\n<p>Then, out of nowhere, Katsuki shrugged and his frown turned into a smirk. He pocketed the coin and leaned back on the bench, propping himself up with his arms and looking relaxed. He tilted his head slightly, meeting Izuku\u2019s eyes. Izuku suddenly felt very nervous and warm. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder just how much Deku could lift with those arms of his.\u201d </p>\n<p>A flaming blush slammed into Izuku\u2019s cheeks as he felt his eyes go wide, heart fluttering wildly. Why did he say it like that? Katsuki was still watching him with slightly hooded eyes and a smirk, one eyebrow just barely raised. </p>\n<p>\u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d Izuku stuttered. \u201cI don\u2019t-I\u2019ve never really\u2026never really tried to max out so I-I don\u2019t know, exactly, how much I, uh\u2026\u201d He felt like his face was melting off now. And Katsuki was <em>still staring at him</em>. What was going on? \u201cI mean I\u2019ve lifted All Might before,\u201d he blurted nervously. </p>\n<p>Katsuki raised his eyebrow all the way, frowning slightly. \u201cAnyone could lift him, Deku, the man is a fuckin\u2019 skeleton.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI meant in his big guy form,\u201d Izuku clarified, face still burning. Katsuki blinked at him in surprise, and if Izuku was not mistaken, his eyes went slightly wider. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d </p>\n<p>Oh? <em>Oh</em>? What was that supposed to mean? </p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Izuku responded awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. He was sweating way too much. Gross. \u201cSo\u2026I guess that would be a few hundred kilos.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d Katsuki said, sounding slightly hoarse. Huh? Then, Katsuki shook his head a bit and cleared his throat. \u201cI bet I could fucking do that too, nerd.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku smiled at him, glad for the normal Katsuki again. \u201cWe should ask All Might next time we see him. You have to prove it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll prove it when you prove it, Deku,\u201d Katsuki said coolly, pushing himself off the bench. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t think I could do it?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre <em>you</em> saying you don\u2019t think <em>I</em> could do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After that day, the nature of the penny swapping shifted a bit. Instead of tossing the coin to Katsuki at any random moment, Izuku found himself waiting for the times he saw Katsuki looking at <em>him</em>. And what\u2019s weirder, Katsuki seemed to be doing the same thing. This change meant that now, almost all thoughts they shared were about each other.</p>\n<p>Izuku had no idea what to think about it all, and he had no name for what he <em>felt</em> about it all. There were too many feelings to name, really. Though, flustered was probably up there near the top of the list. Especially when Katsuki kept <em>complimenting him</em>. </p>\n<p>Because, sure, Izuku had been forced to voice some thoughts that were a little not-normal (i.e., \u201cKacchan looks like a supermodel\u201d, which was one of the most embarrassing moments of his life, as he was forced to say it right before sparring Katsuki in front of their class. He lost.), but most of the stuff Izuku thought about Katsuki was stuff he\u2019d been saying proudly since they were kids. But <em>Katsuki</em>, complimenting <em>him</em>? That didn\u2019t happen. Or, on the rare occasions it did happen, it was always something objective and focused on his fighting or quirk improvement. It was a curt nod and a \u201cgood work, Deku\u201d. Maybe a tiny smile if it was a really big accomplishment and Izuku got lucky. What it was <em>not</em> was something like \u201cDeku\u2019s improved suit design looks even better on him than before\u201d. </p>\n<p>Because what the hell did <em>that</em> mean?</p>\n<p>Just thinking about all the things Katsuki had said the past few weeks made Izuku\u2019s cheeks go warm, and he was sure he was blushing profusely, so he pulled up the hood of his costume to cover his face. It didn\u2019t help that Katsuki was standing right next to him as they both watched their classmates go through a rescue simulation exercise on the screens. He did his best to focus on the footage of Tokoyami and Uraraka working to dig fake civilians out from under rubble without collapsing the building. Suddenly, he felt someone watching him. When he turned, Katsuki was glaring at him and frowning. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku asked nervously. </p>\n<p>Katsuki huffed and reached over to yank on one the ears of his hood. \u201cI hate this stupid hood.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Izuku whined, readjusting the mask. \u201cMy mom thinks it\u2019s cool.\u201d As soon as he said it, he wanted to take it back. That was way to dorky to say. </p>\n<p>Katsuki still looked disgruntled. \u201cYou\u2019re cuter without it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku train of thought comes to a screeching halt. His eyes go wide. Did he hear that right? What the heck? Did Katsuki just say he was cute? </p>\n<p>Izuku ran back through the last few seconds in his head and discovered that yes, Katsuki did just say that and no, Izuku had not given him the penny beforehand. Izuku didn\u2019t even have the penny right now. Katsuki just said it. He\u2019d thought it and then he\u2019d said it of his own volition. </p>\n<p>\n<em>Why?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Did he mean it? Maybe Katsuki was just messing with him. He couldn\u2019t have meant that. Right? No one would call Izuku cute. He was totally plain. He knew that. Especially next to Katsuki, of all people. Yeah, Katsuki calling him cute was definitely a joke. Teasing. It was a weird tease, but may-</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, Deku, stop it,\u201d Katsuki snapped, making Izuku jolt and realize he had slipped into mumbling. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he squeaked, shying away from Katsuki a bit. Katsuki frowned at him again, but instead of the previous judgment, he looked almost concerned. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d Katsuki said out of nowhere. Okay, well, it wasn\u2019t out of nowhere, but it still always shocked Izuku that Katsuki could understand any of his rambling mumbles. Katsuki was probably the only one that could. </p>\n<p>And then what Katsuki actually said fully catches up to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he squeaked again. </p>\n<p>Katsuki met his eyes, then cleared his throat and looked away. \u201cI mean\u2026I won\u2019t, uh, say it again if you don\u2019t\u2026want me to.\u201d </p>\n<p>It is utterly humiliating how fast Izuku jolts up and says, a bit too loudly, \u201cNo!\u201d Katsuki turns back to look at him, brows raised. Izuku feels his face heat up dramatically under the red stare and the weight of what he just said. How was he supposed to say that he like it when Katsuki complimented him? Did he like it? He kinda definitely did.</p>\n<p>Katsuki squinted at him, then, seemingly out of nowhere, the penny was between Katsuki\u2019s fingers as he held it up and presented it to Izuku. </p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s heart beat wildly in his chest as he took the coin and dropped it in one of the pouches on his costume. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to meet Katsuki\u2019s eyes anymore, so he looked back at the screens, where Uraraka and Tokoyami looked almost finished. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026uh\u2026nice when Kacchan compliments me,\u201d he finally manages, barely loud enough for anyone to hear. His shoulders are up by his ears by now, and he\u2019s sure his face is bright, strawberry red under his hood. He was too scared to look and see whatever expression Katsuki has on. </p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou! Ashido! You\u2019re up!\u201d Aizawa-sensei calls before Katsuki or Izuku say anything more. </p>\n<p>Izuku finally starts to turn, thinking he should at least wish Katsuki good luck to not be weird, but suddenly feels another tug on his hood as it\u2019s pulled all the way down. Katsuki let go of the ears, grinning that grin that he has whenever he wins something. A million butterflies fluttered in Izuku\u2019s stomach as his heart skipped a few beats. </p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to keep doing it then, nerd,\u201d Katsuki said cockily, taking a few steps backwards towards the exit while keeping his eyes on Izuku before turning around and walking out, leaving Izuku a melted puddle of confusion and feelings on the floor. When Uraraka comes in with Tokoyami, he\u2019s forced to pull himself together enough to form the words \u201cnice job\u201d but not enough for Uraraka to miss how he\u2019s acting. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Is all Izuku can manage, mind still racing with echoes of words and images of Katsuki\u2019s grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku? You okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Izuku said, trying to muster up a normal smile. His eyes keep drifting to the door that Katsuki left out of. Suddenly, Uraraka waves a hand in front of his face, making him physically startle, blinking a few times to bring himself out of his head. Gah, what was wrong with him? \u201cYes?\u201d </p>\n<p>Uraraka frowns and squints at him. \u201cDeku, seriously, are you okay? You\u2019ve been weird lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have?\u201d Izuku asked, though he was sure he had been. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026I feel like it has something to do with Bakugou.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku feels his face heat up against his will. His body is betraying him. \u201cWhat? Kacchan?\u201d he said, far too high-pitched. \u201cWhat does he have to do with anything?\u201d Uraraka gives him a <em>look</em>, and he smiles at her nervously. \u201cSo!\u201d he said before she could confront him further. \u201cTell me about the simulation! You don\u2019t work with Tokoyami a lot, right? How did it go? I bet your quirks work well together for a rescue operation!\u201d </p>\n<p>Uraraka kept looking at him for a second, obviously hesitant to let it go, but she eventually smiled at him. \u201cIt was great! And you\u2019re right, out quirks did work well together.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After <em>that</em>, things changed even more. Katsuki was complimenting Izuku almost as much as Izuku complimented Katsuki, even without the penny. And even when they weren\u2019t sparring or something. Izuku still got flustered every time it happened, but he was starting to get better at hiding it. He was also getting more confident in his own compliments and shared thoughts, because, hey, if Katsuki was going to say he thought Izuku\u2019s messy hair was cute, then he could say he thought Katsuki\u2019s different smiles were awesome. </p>\n<p>Izuku didn\u2019t know what any of it meant, though. He and Katsuki were friends as well as rivals, and he could say that with confidence now, but was this something you did with a friend? It wasn\u2019t something you did with a rival, he guessed. Whatever it all was, Izuku didn\u2019t want it to end. Even all the weird, fluttery butterflies and melty-ness. </p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Deku,\u201d Katsuki said from across the table where they were both finishing up an assignment after evening sparring. \u201cPick up the couch.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku frowned at him. \u201cReally?\u201d That was another new thing. Ever since Izuku said he could lift All Might, Katsuki and Izuku had been daring each other to pick different things up to see if they could. The heavier, the better. Izuku had to admit, he liked this game more than a bit. Katsuki was easily stronger than most of their class and had the muscles to show it. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying you can\u2019t?\u201d Katsuki challenged with a smirk, resting his chin on his palm. </p>\n<p>Izuku met his smirk with the new confidence he\u2019d been building. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t just want to watch me lift it?\u201d It slips out before he can even think it all the way, but he bites his tongue to stop himself from taking it back. Katsuki\u2019s eyes widen a bit, and his hand drops down as he sits up straighter, mouth open but not saying anything. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut the-why would I-\u201d Katsuki splutters, and holy crap what is going on. \u201cStop fucking stalling, Deku,\u201d Katsuki eventually snaps. His cheeks are tinted pink, and the confidence in Izuku\u2019s chest overflows. </p>\n<p>He smiles and shrugs his shoulder. \u201cSure, Kacchan.\u201d He pushed himself up from his seat and made his way to the nearest couch, where Ashido and Hagakure were lounging around and chatting. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d he announced, getting the girl\u2019s attention. \u201cKacchan wants me to prove I can pick up this couch. I don\u2019t want to lift you up if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCould you do it with us on it?\u201d Hagakure asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku answered coolly, not used to the feeling but basking in it anyways. Ashido\u2019s black and yellow eyes went wide and sparkled as she grinned and pulled her legs up on the couch. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo it!\u201d she cried excitedly. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Hagakure agreed. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, then! Please hold on, I don\u2019t want you to fall.\u201d Izuku rolled his shoulders back to ready himself before bending his knees, slipping his arms under the couch, and lifting it up with a grunt. The girls shrieked with laughter as he stood up fully, leaning back slightly to tilt the couch up so he could keep it balanced. After a moment like that, he took a deep breath and hefted upwards, lifting the above his head so he could turn to beam at Katsuki. \u201cThat good enough for you, Kacchan?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki blinked at him like he hadn\u2019t been listening, then rolled his eyes. \u201cFine, you got me.\u201d Izuku smiled wider and slowly lowered the couch to the ground, setting it down gently as he panted. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Ashido squealed, leaning over the side of the couch towards Katsuki. \u201cBakugou is <em>blushing</em>~!\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki jolted to his feet and slammed his fist down on the table, glaring menacingly. \u201cWhat?\u201d Now that Ashido mentioned it, Izuku did see a flush of red on his cheeks. Huh?</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan, are you okay?\u201d Izuku asked, concerned. Maybe he was sick? Suddenly, Ashido and Hagakure started cackling as Katsuki just gaped at him, looking somewhere between angry and incredulous. </p>\n<p>What kind of reactions were\u2026those\u2026wait. Realization slowly dawned on him. Was Katsuki actually blushing? Because he picked up a couch? But why? He patted his pocket for the penny, only to remember that Katsuki had it. </p>\n<p>Katsuki glared at him, noticing what he was doing. \u201cNo way, Deku.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku frowned, his confidence beginning to wilt. Why would Katsuki start hiding things again now? What did he do? \u201cSorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki glare softened a bit, then he glanced back and forth between Izuku and the still laughing girls, seeming agitated. \u201cWait, no-gah, fuck this,\u201d he swore, groaning in exasperation. Suddenly, he made a b-line for Izuku and grabbed him by the wrist, dragging him away from the couch. \u201cC\u2019mon, Deku.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku squeaked in surprise and followed Katsuki out of the dorms as the girls laughed and shouted things after them, but he didn\u2019t hear what because he was too focused on what Katsuki was doing and the spiral of worry in his head. Was Katsuki mad at him for something? Did the girls tease him too far? Did <em>Izuku</em> tease him too far? He was only joking about the wanting-to-watch thing, because why would Katsuki want to see that? Then again, he did blush, but that was just a fluke or something. Why else would he blush? Maybe he wasn\u2019t even blushing. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeku,\u201d Katsuki deadpans, snapping Izuku out of his mumbles and making him come to screeching stop right in front of Katsuki. He quickly takes a few steps back, then realizes Katsuki pulled him to the edge of the forested area behind the dorms. </p>\n<p>Okay, so this was a private conversation. That could go numerous different ways. One of them could be a fight, but that hadn\u2019t happened in long while. Maybe Katsuki wanted to spar? He seemed agitated, and Izuku knew sparring was his preferred way to let off steam \u2013 as opposed to yelling and blowing things up, which he would usually do if not presented with the first option. He could\u2019ve just asked to spar if he wanted to, though, instead of-</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku!\u201d Katsuki yelled. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna fight you! Shit, is that what you think of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Izuku can do is stare at him because\u2026well, yes, that\u2019s the impression Katsuki had given off the past 17 years of their lives. </p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s angry look melts off his face, replaced by something akin to defeat or resignation. It was a very strange, wrong look on his face, and made Izuku worried. </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is, it\u2019s what I deserve,\u201d Katsuki sighed. What? \u201cNo, Deku, I did not drag you out here to start a fight or something. I did that because I needed to get us away from those annoying-ass squealing idiots.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAshido and Hagakure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026they were just teasing, you know. Me too. I know you weren\u2019t\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Izuku trailed off, unsure exactly what he knew Katsuki wasn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Deku-\u201d Katsuki cuts himself off with another groan, raking his hands through his pretty ash-blonde hair. \u201cFuck, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku frowned. He\u2019d rarely seen Katsuki this unsure. Whatever he was trying to say had to have been weighing on his mind for a long time. </p>\n<p>Katsuki had always been a man of action, meaning he happened to struggle a lot with words. Usually, he chose to forgo any attempt to voice whatever he was thinking and said it with his actions instead, and Izuku was able to understand \u2013 or at least eventually coax enough words out of him to piece it together. But this felt different. It felt like Katsuki really <em>wanted</em> to say what he was thinking but just couldn\u2019t bring himself to. And he didn\u2019t want to use his normal solution for that problem. </p>\n<p>Izuku could work with that. </p>\n<p>He held out his palm expectantly, and Katsuki stared down at it, confused. After a beat, Katsuki produced the penny from his pockets and dropped it onto Izuku\u2019s palm. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wish Kacchan would say whatever\u2019s on his mind since it seems to stress him out so much,\u201d Izuku said. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing him like this, I want him to be happy.\u201d Katsuki looked at him with and unreadable expression, and Izuku pushed the penny back into his friend\u2019s hand. Then, he waited. He would always wait as long as Katsuki needed. </p>\n<p>After a minute of silence and the two of them just staring at each other, Katsuki finally spoke. His voice was far softer and quieter than normal, yet there wasn\u2019t a drop of uncertainty in the faint roughness. </p>\n<p>\u201cDeku is probably the only person in the entire world who\u2019d be dumb and amazing enough to put up with me this long. I want to kiss him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku felt himself start to melt under the unwavering gaze of Katsuki\u2019s crimson red eyes as a wobbly smile spread across his lips. Was this real? Katsuki really just said that?</p>\n<p>Katsuki slowly lifted his hand and pressed the penny into his scarred palm. Izuku was hardly able to formulate a thought right then, let alone any words, but he manages one: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like time skips over a second or two, and he\u2019s suddenly leaning up slightly and Katsuki leans down presses their lips together. Katsuki\u2019s lips are soft and he tastes faintly of wasabi, a hint of spice that makes Izuku\u2019s lips tingle, but he enjoys it all the more because it\u2019s Katsuki. He feels Katsuki\u2019s hands running through his hair and he responds by hugging Katsuki\u2019s waist and pulling him close. The warm penny was still enclosed in the fist he had pressed against the back of Katsuki\u2019s shirt. </p>\n<p>When they pull away a few drawn out moments later, Katsuki\u2019s hands move from his hair and he rests his arms over Izuku\u2019s shoulders, staring down at him with a look so soft and foreign that Izuku takes a second to remember what breathing is. </p>\n<p>And then what exactly just happened slams into him like a bullet train at full speed, and the anxiety starts building in his chest with the nervous blush that spread across his cheeks and ears. But, to his surprise and slight horror, the anxiety bubbles up and fizzes out in giddy, insane giggles. </p>\n<p>Katsuki looked baffled. \u201cWhat the hell, Deku?\u201d </p>\n<p>As the Izuku in his head is screaming at him to calm down because he is very much ruining the moment, all he can do outside his head is giggle even more and press his forehead down onto Katsuki\u2019s shoulder, trying to pull himself together. Crap, he is really bad at this. Why can\u2019t he stop laughing? </p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s hands are placed on the back of his head again. He likes the way they feel in his hair. \u201cDeku? Why the fuck are you laughing?\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku giggles so hard he snorts, pressing his nose into Katsuki\u2019s shoulder to muffle the sound. Holy crap, he\u2019s <em>giddy</em>. Is this what being drunk feels like? </p>\n<p>\u201cYou kissed me!\u201d he eventually manages through another giggle. He hugs Katsuki closer by the waist. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt felt mutual to me, nerd.\u201d Katsuki ruffled his hair, making Izuku laugh again and look up at him. He\u2019s so pretty with his silly confusion mixed with a smile, and Izuku can\u2019t help but lean in to smack their lips together again, only for a second. Katsuki looked shocked and Izuku beamed at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou taste spicy, Kacchan,\u201d is all he can think to say. He is so, so bad at this but Katsuki is smiling again so he must be doing something right. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well you taste like salt. From all that junky shit you eat.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDarn it. I need to eat something sugary.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki raised and eyebrow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Izuku said, leaning in to bonk their noses together like it\u2019s the most natural things in the world, \u201cthen we\u2019re sweet and spicy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be sweet and salty, dummy,\u201d Katsuki says, but his cheeks are flushed just as pink as Izuku\u2019s. Izuku blinks at him, then shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess I have to kiss you enough to make <em>you</em> the salty one, <em>then</em> go eat something sweet.\u201d He enjoys the way Katsuki melted into him a little as he pressed their lips together once more, glad he\u2019s not the only one. He feels like if he lets go of Katsuki\u2019s waist he\u2019s going dissolve into the grass. </p>\n<p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Katsuki grumbled when they part, \u201cwhy do I have to be the salty one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughed a little. \u201cI think even you know that, Kacchan.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI can be sweet,\u201d Katsuki said, in a similar way to when he says, \u2018I can win this\u2019, like it\u2019s a challenge he\u2019s facing head-on. It\u2019s adorable, and Izuku thinks he\u2019s dying because of it. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve learned!\u201d he chirped, squeezing Katsuki\u2019s waist again. \u201cWhat was it you said? Deku\u2019s amazing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019re paraphrasing a bit there,\u201d Katsuki said, tilting his head. </p>\n<p>Izuku finally unlatches his arms from around Katsuki\u2019s waist to quickly drop the penny in his pocket and cup Katsuki\u2019s cheeks in his hands, squishing them together a bit. \u201cKacchan thinks I\u2019m amazing~!\u201d he sang, beaming as his heart fluttered happily in his chest. \u201cSay it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki huffs at him, then rolls his eyes and pries Izuku\u2019s hands off his face. He interlaces their fingers and meets Izuku\u2019s eyes with a tiny, almost dopey smile that\u2019s barely even there. \u201cDeku sugoi.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku squeaks in surprise because he hardly expected Katsuki to actually say it, and feels like he might start crying. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you cry right now, Deku, I swear-\u201d But Izuku doesn\u2019t hear the rest of Katsuki\u2019s threat, because he sweeps him into another kiss. He squeezes Katsuki\u2019s hands that are in his own, and Katsuki squeezes back before they part. This feels like a lot of kisses before you even have a single date with somebody, but who is Izuku to say anything at all about romance. Wait, would they go on dates? </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre we\u2026\u201d Izuku trailed off nervously. He feels so stupid asking this, but he has to know. \u201cAre we\u2026dating now?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki snorts. \u201cWell, I think I\u2019d have to take you on an actual date for that first. Which was my original plan.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku blinks up at him in surprise. \u201cYour plan?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki blushes again. It\u2019s adorable and amazing when he does that. \u201cYeah, my fucking plan. How else was I supposed to get anywhere with this?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou had a plan\u2026to date me?\u201d Izuku asked, not believing a word of it. \u201cWhat was the plan?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki looks almost flustered. Izuku could get used to this. \u201cI fucking\u2026I had a different thing going where I\u2019d ask you to lunch or something but then Raccoon Eyes and the Invisible chick got all\u2026you know, and I made a split second change to confess you out here because I thought you\u2019d figure it out on your own if I didn\u2019t.\u201d Izuku is already shocked out of his mind, but Katsuki keeps going. \u201cAnyways, I was being a weak bitch until you, of course, figured out exactly what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku squeaked. Katsuki had a plan to ask him out. Not only had Katsuki been wanting to do that for long enough to make a plan, but he also made a plan as if it was a battle. Of course he did! He was just as much of a nerd as Izuku was. Always had been. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know me too well, Deku,\u201d Katsuki said, but he didn\u2019t sound mad about that all. </p>\n<p>Izuku couldn\u2019t stop an silly, happy grin. \u201cI also know you\u2019re not one to drop a plan halfway through, Kacchan. Where\u2019s my date? And the confession? Did you write it out beforehand?\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki glares at him. \u201cSo what if I did?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Nerd!\u201d Izuku squeals, letting go of Katsuki\u2019s hands and latching around his torso again. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me!\u201d Katsuki protested. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fuck up!\u2019 </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not making fun, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku assured him. \u201cWho would I be to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s Izuku turn to blush. \u201cOkay, I may or may not have twelve different notes to you drafted in one of my notebooks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku buried his face in Katsuki\u2019s chest and groaned, embarrassed beyond belief. He\u2019d been writing notes addressed to Katsuki on and off since the start of first year, but the crush notes only started near the end. He hadn\u2019t even recognized them as crush notes until just then, nor had he ever planned to send them or tell Katsuki about them at all. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, nerd?\u201d Katsuki said, grabbing Izuku\u2019s cheeks to tilt his head up. \u201cI\u2019ll read you mine when you read me yours. All twelve of \u2018em.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot fair!\u201d </p>\n<p>Katsuki smirked and squished his cheeks together. \u201cTotally fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiled, squishing his face even more against Katsuki\u2019s palms and crinkling up his nose. \u201cFine, Kacchan, be careful what you ask for. I\u2019m gonna make you listen to me read every single notebook I have on you. From when we were 6 onwards. That\u2019s over ten years\u2019 worth.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJokes on you, Deku, I\u2019d love to hear ten years\u2019 worth of you rambling about me. Music to my ears.\u201d Katsuki is full on grinning now, so Izuku\u2019s original plan may have backfired but this new outcome is totally welcome. He\u2019s so pretty when he smiles like that. Or ever. Actually, he\u2019s pretty all the time. And for some reason he likes Izuku. Izuku would be an idiot to question it and chance ruining this, so he tries his best not to. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of yourself,\u201d he teased, sticking his tongue out. Katsuki moves his hands from Izuku\u2019s cheeks back up to his hair, which he seems to have an affinity for. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor good reason,\u201d Katsuki shoots back with a cocky smirk. \u201cNow, you were right, I do have to finish at least part of my plan, even though I\u2019m backing up a few steps.\u201d Izuku stifled a giggle and Katsuki glared at him, then cleared his throat. \u201cDeku, you should go to lunch with me sometime. As a date.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>should</em>?\u201d Izuku repeated, grinning. \u201cNot really giving me a choice, huh?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you said no, I\u2019d probably die, so I tried not to give you that option.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku can\u2019t stop the giggles now, and leans in to smack another quick kiss to Katsuki\u2019s soft lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kacchan, the answer is yes.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s giggling is uncontrollable now, and he can\u2019t stop, even as Katsuki pulls him into another kiss.</p>"
