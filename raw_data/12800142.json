  "text": "<p align=\"justify\">Draco taps a restless finger on a cherry wood side table, itching for a cigarette. Daphne\u2019s engagement ball is excruciatingly dull and even Astoria\u2019s scathing comments about the guests aren\u2019t doing it for him tonight. Draco attends these social events on Astoria\u2019s arm, taunting the stiff men with the booming laughs, shocking the snotty women gossiping behind raised hands, and taking the piss off their peers \u2014 girls who discuss the exact shade of white for proper debutante robes and boys talking about coming into their own vault when they turn twenty-one. He would be one of them, he knows, if his parents hadn\u2019t fucked up so spectacularly during the war and if he hadn\u2019t met Astoria. But for his parents\u2019 blind allegiance to Voldemort, he\u2019d be one of those arguing about the drain St Mungo\u2019s is in the post-war economy, sucking up to guests in preparation for a career in politics, and sniffing coke in the loos with his hand down a man\u2019s pants. Meanwhile, his \u201cwife\u201d would be mingling with guests, exquisitely dressed, and lamenting Granger\u2019s proposal to curtail wizards\u2019 rights over the ownership of house-elves.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Instead, he\u2019s one of the few that knows deep in his bones how rotten things have become, and how hard it\u2019s been these past four years to clean the festering wound in their society that gave rise to the war in the first place. The ally his parents unwittingly provided had taken it upon herself to introduce Draco to the joys of Muggle living and he hasn\u2019t looked back. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He\u2019s eager to leave the ball now. <em>Love Muscle</em> is a night that takes place on rare Saturdays, and underneath his robes he\u2019s wearing tight jeans and a T-shirt that would give his mother a stroke. In the back pocket rests a platinum plastic card called Visa, which Astoria helped him acquire and which gives him access to anything he fancies in the Muggle world. He has the looks and the money and the breeding that propels him straight to the top of the Muggle food chain with the added bonus that no one knows who he is.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He checks his watch. The betrothal ceremony finished over an hour ago, Duncan MacDougal and Daphne holding hands as green stalks slithered around their wrists and joined them, while their mothers wept and their fathers looked proud. \u2018Another hour and we\u2019re out of here?\u2019 he asks Astoria.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She\u2019s been knocking back mead like water. There\u2019s firewhisky aplenty from the MacDougal distilleries, but it\u2019s a big occasion and the parents of the happy couple splashed out. The buffet is heaving with salmon puffs, Madeira-glazed veal and tuna tartare, but this mead is a rare treat: made by the vampire monks of an obscure monastery in Budapest, it brings up a happy memory with every sip, which makes it almost addictive.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018This is quite something.\u2019 Astoria offers him a taste. He sips and feels the rush of alcohol sliding down his throat, bringing to mind a memory of a particularly happy time in the male toilets of Heaven; one of the first clubs Astoria had dragged him to and still a favourite. His cheeks heat up as the memory washes over him and he smiles to Astoria, who smiles back, lost in a reminiscence of her own.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s happy memories are all about sex. And partying and Quidditch and Astoria. But mostly sex.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A wizard ambles past, throwing a frown towards Astoria\u2019s partly-shaven head and her nose and eyebrow piercings, and shakes his head when he notes Draco\u2019s eyeliner. Draco delivers his finest sneer, but he also holds Astoria\u2019s waist tighter. It\u2019s a reflex, automatic, part of the fa\u00e7ade they\u2019re putting on. To his surprise, Astoria steps back this time and abandons her empty goblet on a nearby table next to a bouquet of dusty pink peonies.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Need to talk to you,\u2019 she says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That doesn\u2019t sound good.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It is,\u2019 she insists. \u2018Or rather, it will be.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco peers at her with curiosity as she deliberates, bites her lip, and sweeps back the long hair that covers half her scalp, brown locks with blond ends. Draco has never told her, but he fucking admires her. She\u2019s bold and a little bonkers, and the two became great friends ever since their parents set them up on a date, one in a long row of matchmaking disasters that both had endured.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It makes sense to pretend they\u2019re together. Draco is certain they would be if they weren\u2019t both so very gay.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A wizard jostles him on the way to the buffet and Draco hisses under his breath, but returns his careless apology with a stilted smile. A flick of his wand makes the wizard trip and drop his spinach and feta tart on his silk robes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria rolls her eyes. \u2018You\u2019re a menace.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco tucks his wand deeper. \u2018Let me have my fun. This ball is killing my will to live.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria leads him away from the babble of the party and towards the open window, where long amber curtains flutter in a rain-scented breeze. The late autumn sky blushes violet and pink, and tips, ever so slowly, into night. Eyes and murmurs follow their progress through the crowded room. Astoria\u2019s dress is exceptionally elegant, but Muggle, and Draco barely escaped prison, a fact people carefully avoid mentioning in polite conversation, but never forget.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria takes his hands in hers. \u2018Will you do me a favour?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Anything,\u2019 Draco replies.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She squeezes his hands. \u2018This\u2026 thing we have. It has to end.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco is startled. \u2018What thing?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Us. <em>That</em> thing. It\u2019s just that \u2014 I want to meet someone, Draco. Yes,\u2019 she stops him with a gesture, \u2018I already meet girls, I know. But I want to stop pretending. Daphne says mum and dad might be OK with me dating a witch\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Would they?\u2019 Draco interrupts, genuinely surprised.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Daphne says that now is the best time. They\u2019re so happy with her getting engaged that they might take the news better than we think. And I <em>want to</em>. I want to tell them.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco shudders. His coming out to his parents, three months into his \u201crelationship\u201d with Astoria, was an occasion that the monks\u2019 happy-memory mead will never elicit. \u2018So, you\u2019re \u2014 breaking up with me?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I won\u2019t be your beard anymore, is what I\u2019m saying. We\u2019re still friends. We\u2019ll see each other all the time.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco glances at his parents gliding majestically on the dancefloor to the sound of a waltz. They know he and Astoria are a sham, but as long as Draco appears to be attached in public, they can\u2019t spring up another \u201cunexpected\u201d guest at dinner or drag him to a hunting weekend that the daughter of Such And Such also happens to attend.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You do realise you\u2019re leaving me prey to my parents\u2019 matchmaking attempts?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You indulge them, Draco, and you know it,\u2019 she says, and Draco drops her hands. They\u2019ve had this conversation before. \u2018I admire you for coming out to your parents and you\u2019re the reason I want to do it. Coming out is the hard part; but you\u2019re still allowing them to talk about marriage when it\u2019s the last thing on your mind\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018They\u2019ll stop, eventually\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, they won\u2019t. You know Slytherins.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco does. Communication is an intricate dance for them, alluding and hinting, deflecting and avoiding, circling around a topic but never <em>quite</em> discussing it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Unless you\u2019re more direct about your wishes,\u2019 Astoria insists, \u2018they\u2019ll pretend you said nothing and keep bringing more of these insipid people to dinner. You need to be \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 a Gryffindor about this.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Don\u2019t be crass.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Stars come out in the sky, shy at first, huddling together in the east. In the gardens, the house-elves are lighting a small fire. The betrothed couple will jump over it three times to signify their commitment to overcoming obstacles. Draco hopes Daphne has practiced her leaps. The music stops and a silver bell silences the chatter; heads turn to Duncan\u2019s father who invites the guests to join them outside. Draco checks his watch again, impatient to get away. He feels slightly overwhelmed by Astoria\u2019s request, their impending break-up, even if it\u2019s all a show, and needs a proper drink.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She cups his cheek, her hazel eyes reading his face. \u2018I can\u2019t leave yet,\u2019 she says. \u2018But I know you\u2019re eager to go. Say hi to Blaise for me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco nods and starts to leave, but Astoria doesn\u2019t let go yet. \u2018This is a good thing,\u2019 she reminds him. \u2018Let\u2019s be brave and be happy.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018A very Gryffindorian sentiment. Not my style,\u2019 he comments. \u2018Hopelessly in love with the wrong man is more \u2026 <em>me</em>.\u2019 He winks at her, pretends it\u2019s a joke when it isn\u2019t, and he sees in her eyes that she sees right through him. He kisses her cheek and Apparates to Blaise\u2019s bar, pulling his robes off when he arrives.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What on <em>earth</em> are you wearing?\u2019 Blaise asks when Draco approaches, pushing through the crowd of well-dressed, beautiful people, who sway in the rhythm of a sultry, smoky tune. His eyebrows rise as he looks Draco up and slowly down. \u2018You look like a right tart.\u2019 Knowing Blaise, that\u2019s high praise.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That\u2019s the idea,\u2019 Draco winks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Muggle clubbing later, then? I think I\u2019ll branch out, you know. As soon as the bar is making enough profit.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco commandeers the stool next to him and orders a Finnish vodka-soda from one of the Patils. Blaise opened this bar a year ago and it has become the latest sensation in the witching world. He employs the Patil twins, the Carrow twins he met in the Slug Club as well as an army of twinks to work behind the long wooden bar and serve the tables, while he mingles, drinking something expensive and flirting with scantily dressed witches, and calls this a job. Often Draco spends his evenings in a similar manner, drinking shots and flirting with wizards who\u2019ll flirt back but won\u2019t date him, and he also calls this a job \u2014 mainly in his parents\u2019 hearing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How was the ball?\u2019 Blaise asks, gesturing to Parvati that Draco\u2019s drink is on the house.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hell is a mansion full of boring people and crystal figurines,\u2019 Draco says. He sips his vodka, thinks for a moment and shrugs. \u2018The food was nice, though.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t know if I should serve food here,\u2019 Blaise thinks out loud. Conversation for Blaise is an elastic band, stretched for a brief time before it snaps back to him. He named the bar <em>Blaze</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You could do <em>chips</em>,\u2019 Draco teases and Blaise shudders. Draco swirls his glass and watches the ice cubes bump into each other. \u2018I\u2019m single now.\u2019 The bitterness in his voice startles him, and Blaise revolves in his seat, attention \u2014 for once \u2014 snapped.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you mind it? It was a pretense, no?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was, but the pretense came with clubbing nights and cinema evenings, dinner at Muggle and wizarding restaurants and walks by the river on warm nights. Astoria knows about the thing he never told anyone else, although Draco suspects that Blaise might have guessed. She often comes to his flat in London after a night out, sometimes with a girl, spends the night in his guest bedroom and cooks breakfast in the morning. Draco feels bereft, a pang of loss, even though none of it needs to stop altogether. It\u2019s just that Astoria would like a girl to do these things with, which leaves Draco with no one and certainly not the one he wants.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Blaise nods as he listens to Draco. \u2018I can come crash at your guestroom with a girl, if it\u2019ll ease the transition,\u2019 he offers and Draco rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And what\u2019s worse is that my parents will be already conspiring to introduce me to someone before the week is out.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Well, then, you\u2019ll have to find yourself a new fake girlfriend,\u2019 Blaise suggests and stands. \u2018Or dare I say it, a real boyfriend.\u2019 He pats Draco on the back and is off being a host. Draco pushes back his empty glass and Disapparates to south London where men are already queuing outside the club. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry likes the clubs. He likes dancing, being lost in a rhythm that makes his heart pound almost outside his chest. He loves the darkness, the writhing bodies around him, all together and alone at the same time, all surrendering to this peculiar music and its promise: oblivion. He closes his eyes and raises his hands and shouts with the rest of them \u2014 and for a moment, he\u2019s not the Boy Who Lived but a boy like all the others. Ginny, her hair a long curtain of fire, laughs as she jumps up and down, holding the waist of some girl she pulled. Ron and Hermione dance together, laughing at private jokes whispered in each other\u2019s ear. Harry can make out Luna\u2019s bright hair under the strobing lights. This music is a godsend, he thinks, as the tune changes (it\u2019s a good one) and the whole club whistles and rises to their feet, heaving as one, a beast of many hearts, furiously alive.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When they leave the club, they traipse down Charing Cross trying to find somewhere to get some food. London is dark and drizzly, full of the odour of car exhaust and rubbish. Saturday nights smell of lager and rain; they sound like car tires slashing the wet street, off-tune singing and a siren wailing in the distance. They taste like freedom, like forgetfulness, like life. There are moments that all thoughts of Will vanish like slippery dreams that can\u2019t hold up to the daylight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shit, how he misses him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The chip shop is full, lines of intoxicated people shoving, flirting, nibbling on too hot chips, the sharp smell of vinegar in the air. They get their food and sit down on the curb, after casting a discreet Scourgify. Ginny\u2019s not with them. She\u2019s stayed at the club snogging that girl, and Luna is half-asleep but she picks dutifully at her chicken donner. She loves the Muggle world, Luna. \u2018Wilder than the steppes of Siberia where the Horned Corklarash lives.\u2019 She likes watching the cars pass by, doing mental Arithmancy on the numbers of the licence plates, claiming she can predict natural disasters this way as well as the next Muggle chart hit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Conversation turns to <em>the</em> event of the year and Harry groans. Not three months ago, he was thrilled to be asked to participate in the friendly Quidditch game between St Mungo\u2019s and the Aurors, the proceeds to go to the Dementor Victim Clinic. He wanted to help raise money, but he also liked the idea of playing against his Healer boyfriend, a bit of good-natured rivalry and fun in the sky, before they would slink off to the flat they shared for some fun in the sheets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Now the whole thing fills him with dread. \u2018I can always pretend to be sick,\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Robards will <em>fire</em> you, Golden Boy or not,\u2019 Ron says. He has an arm around Hermione\u2019s waist, his fingers stroking the sliver of brown skin under her cropped top. Harry looks away, the intimacy making his heart ache. He wishes noticing their casual touching didn\u2019t bring his ex to mind, but it unfailingly does. \u2018Actually, no,\u2019 Ron reflects, \u2018he will <em>kill</em> you first and <em>then</em> fire you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Anticipation for the coming Quidditch game has reached fever pitch in both workplaces. The Aurors are in a frenzy and Robards rivals Wood \u2014 whom he hired as a coach \u2014 in his obsession, especially as he\u2019s always at odds with the Head Healer, a woman he famously had a childhood grudge with. Half of the chalkboard in the Auror office with the active cases and shift schedule is now taken by Quidditch training times and diagrams of flying techniques. Ron is right; Robards will go for the Avada first, the dismissal second.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And then there\u2019s the gala\u2026\u2019 Hermione says. \u2018Who are you going with?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry wraps his unfinished kebab and bins it, his appetite gone. He doesn\u2019t want to admit that he\u2019s every bit as incapable of finding a date to parties as he was in his teens. He\u2019s never really had to \u2014 he and Ginny had been friends first. Then, working as an Auror, he kept ending up at St Mungo\u2019s where the same handsome Healer treated his wounds and chatted with him about sports. It felt natural to ask Will to grab a coffee together when they bumped into each other in Flourish and Blotts, and before Harry knew it, he\u2019d moved in with him and they were shopping for curtains together.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019ll take Luna,\u2019 Harry says, but his usual party companion turns her large eyes to him in remorse.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Harry, but I\u2019m leaving for Sweden the day after tomorrow. Rolf owled me to say that it\u2019s mating season for the flying reindeer and two were spotted by some locals \u2014 admittedly, one of the blokes was exceptionally drunk when it happened, and the other is half-blind \u2014 but Rolf says we\u2019re certain to catch them and witness the mating dance ourselves.\u2019 She smiles blithely at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The event is in a month,\u2019 Harry tries again, feeling a little desperate. \u2018You might be back by then.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019ll be flying back and forth in the next four weeks, but I doubt I can make it <em>that</em> weekend. The Winter Solstice is the day with the most sightings.\u2019 She yawns, and it\u2019s the cue for the others to stand up as well. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You don\u2019t <em>have </em>to take anyone,\u2019 Ron says as they duck inside a dark alley.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Will might not come with a date either,\u2019 Hermione offers and an acute hope of reconciliation stabs Harry\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The others say their good nights and Apparate home, but Harry can\u2019t sleep. The night\u2019s exertions are burning through his veins and he doesn\u2019t want to return to the empty Grimmauld Place, which only serves to remind him of what he\u2019s missing, so he trudges down Diagon Alley for the one place that stays open after four.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The bar <em>Blaze</em> is sleek, stylish and suave, like its owner. It\u2019s also quite empty at this time and they\u2019re still serving alcohol so it\u2019s perfect. Hestia Carrow is at the bar as he takes a seat. There\u2019s almost no one there. Blaise Zabini is chatting with two young women, sisters it looks like, in one of the brown leather sofas. Laughter is coming from a corner booth and the music is low and mellow, sweet like chocolate. He stares at the bottles on the shelves behind Hestia to decide what to drink.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Whenever you\u2019re ready,\u2019 Hestia says, tapping black manicured fingers on the polished surface, and Harry shakes his head to clear it, slightly tipsy and quite dazed by the selection. He\u2019s usually a pint man, but he doesn\u2019t feel like ale right now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Try the Finnish dwarf vodka,\u2019 says a familiar voice beside him. \u2018Two doubles of Lempo, soda and lime,\u2019 Malfoy tells Hestia and slides onto the stool next to him. He\u2019s wearing something absolutely ridiculous that draws Harry\u2019s eyes and keeps them there. Harry can\u2019t help it, he\u2019s only flesh and blood.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Or maybe I choose what I drink?\u2019 he hears himself objecting.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hestia turns and raises her well-plucked and not impressed eyebrow. \u2018What will it be then?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry swallows. \u2018Um, vodka, soda and lime is fine.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy smirks. He notices Harry staring at his top. \u2018Too conservative?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry snorts. \u2018Just a tad.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hestia thuds their glasses in front of them and joins the laughing group in the corner booth. Malfoy fishes a pack of cigarettes from his back pocket and lights one, then pulls it out and stares at it. \u2018These are not even mine,\u2019 he laughs, checking the packet. He\u2019s sweaty and flushed pink, his hair damp on his forehead, his pupils large, his lips swollen as if he\u2019s just been kissed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Good night?\u2019 Harry asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs. \u2018The usual. A dance, a snog, a blowjob in the toilets.\u2019 He smirks again when Harry chokes on his vodka and stretches a hand to lazily pat him on the back. \u2018Easy there, Potter. Did I shock you? I seem to remember seeing you in the gay clubs, back in the day. You know what those places are like.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry knows. He wants to ask if Malfoy gave or received head, but doesn\u2019t. Both mental images, Malfoy on his knees on the dirty tiles, or Malfoy leaning back on the cubicle wall, eyes shut and a smile playing on his lips, fill his stomach with a swirling unease. Something slow and heavy trickles in his veins. He sips his drink, Malfoy smokes and they share a silence as pleasant as stepping on crushed glass. Hermione and Malfoy\u2019s enmity might have thawed during the time they\u2019d worked on the Prison Reformation Scheme and after the Incident, but Malfoy has always kept his distance from Harry. The way he looks at Harry now is guarded, wary; as if looking at him is distasteful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What about you?\u2019 Malfoy says, staring at his glass. \u2018Can\u2019t sleep?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Just wanted a nightcap. I was\u2026 too excited.\u2019 He remembers why he came here, the beacon of hope that he might get back together with Will, a hope he\u2019d never really relinquished, and smiles into his glass.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Astoria dumped me,\u2019 Malfoy says unexpectedly. He slants a sideways look at Harry and smirks with malice. \u2018Any tips? Dumpee to dumpee?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The longing that\u2019s been burning in Harry\u2019s veins turns into rage so easily. They\u2019ve always been close, those two feelings; a flip of a knife\u2019s edge and one emotion turns into the other. Rows with Will ended up in sweaty sheets and a sated smile for both of them. If Harry was honest with himself, he\u2019d admit that make-up sex retained its appeal for the first few months only; eventually the rows ended up in slammed doors. But he\u2019s drunk and he doesn\u2019t want to be honest. What he wants is to grab Malfoy and hex him into next Tuesday. \u2018Once an arsehole, always\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The door opens, letting in a gust of cool night air, and Harry turns automatically as he speaks, and then he can\u2019t speak anymore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Two men fall in, shut the door behind them, and flop on a chesterfield. One of them is a Quidditch player from the Wasps. Spanish, dark and lanky, a transfer from the Toledo Toros, and one of the best Chasers in Europe.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The other one is Will.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy has turned on his stool and is staring at the two men, who are so absorbed in each other that they haven\u2019t noticed Hestia standing in front of them and clearing her throat twice. Harry expects Malfoy to taunt him, but he doesn\u2019t. For once, he looks serious and holds himself still.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s heart has turned into ice. Pain is gutting him and it becomes more ferocious every passing second, every second Will smiles at Joaquin Whatshisname and brushes his lips against his cheek in a way that suggests that later they\u2019ll be brushing other things against each other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He can\u2019t stand it; he bends over his knees trying to stem the pain, and senses Malfoy jumping from his stool and standing in front of him, covering him from sight. \u2018Don\u2019t give him the satisfaction, Potter,\u2019 he says. He clasps Harry\u2019s shoulder, and Harry takes several deep breaths before he rises. Malfoy is right in front of him, shielding Will from view. Harry wants and doesn\u2019t want to see what his ex is doing, but Malfoy won\u2019t budge.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Get a grip on yourself,\u2019 he scolds Harry again. \u2018Come. Let\u2019s get you out of here so you can have your breakdown in private.\u2019 He calls at Hestia to put the drinks on his tab and waits for Harry to stand.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exit is close to the table where Will sits and Harry sees him lift his eyes from the Chaser\u2019s, sensing their approach. In a moment of desperation, he grabs Malfoy\u2019s hand and whispers out of the corner of his mouth, \u2018Play along.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy raises an eyebrow, but he doesn\u2019t pull his hand away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will finally notices Harry and freezes, with the same apologetic expression he gives Harry whenever they cross paths. It infuriates Harry, every single time. Will\u2019s eyes travel to Harry\u2019s hand, clasped with another man\u2019s. A shadow of shock or even anger crosses his face when he sees that man is Malfoy. A small flare of gratification flutters inside Harry; at least, Will isn\u2019t <em>indifferent.</em> He nods hello, hoping he looks casual, Will nods back, and then Harry takes the last few steps and he\u2019s outside.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The cold air does him some good. Malfoy pulls his hand free as soon as they\u2019re out of sight and lights up another cigarette. \u2018Joaquin Villena\u2019s coaching the St Mungo\u2019s staff team,\u2019 he says as they walk down Diagon Alley. \u2018For your charity match.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry groans. \u2018I\u2019ll have to break my leg. Will you break my leg?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It would be my pleasure,\u2019 Malfoy drawls. \u2018But first you have to give me a reason. I don\u2019t break legs just for fun, you know.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019ve reached the Leaky, although Harry doesn\u2019t remember getting there. He should Apparate home, but his limbs are shaking. \u2018Because I\u2019m playing in the match,\u2019 he says, \u2018and Will is playing, and now his\u2014\u2019 He stops, he can\u2019t say the word.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The Spanish hunk he\u2019ll be shagging later tonight is going to be present?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry glares at him. \u2018Are you enjoying this?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy leans against the wall. \u2018A little,\u2019 he admits. \u2018But I have a proposition for you, Potter, and it\u2019s in your best interest to take it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m not sleeping with you. I\u2019m not <em>that</em> drunk,\u2019 Harry adds, because he\u2019s furious and hurt, and Malfoy makes a good target.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s smile could freeze hell. \u2018Charming. Perhaps I\u2019ll reconsider helping you make your ex jealous.\u2019 He takes his wand out and prepares to leave, but doesn\u2019t go far. Harry grabs his arm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy taps the wall, and the arch opens. \u2018I live in Knightsbridge. Walk me home?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As soon as they\u2019re in the Muggle world, Harry relaxes, as if the more distance he puts between him and Will, the easier it is to breathe. The streets are empty at this time of night. Sunrise isn\u2019t too far away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy begins. \u2018I suppose you don\u2019t want to show up to the event of the year without a partner while your ex is shagging the hottest man on UK soil. Right? You want to make him jealous, you want to show to the world that you\u2019re not <em>pathetically </em>pining over him, like an utter <em>loser</em>, and you probably won\u2019t find a real boyfriend in a month, seeing as you <em>are</em> pathetically pining over Burke like an utter loser. Am I correct so far?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry nods, disregarding the insults. He supposes Malfoy can\u2019t help it, they\u2019re like oxygen to him probably.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So you need to be a Slytherin about it. And I need to be a Gryffindor about \u2026 things. We could work together. Scratch my back while I scratch yours.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What\u2019s in it for you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re walking along Hyde Park now, the Albert memorial glinting in the street lights. The silence is complete; if it wasn\u2019t for the wind, Harry would think this wasn\u2019t real. There is a dreamlike essence surrounding them; the sunrise gathering in the sky, the empty streets and dark buildings, the eeriness of being the only moving thing in a still world. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy tucks his hands in his pockets. \u2018Astoria wants to start seeing people and to do that she has to stop pretending she\u2019s going out with me. Only that means my parents will resume matchmaking in the hopes I\u2019ll settle down and become a good pureblood with a family, a job in law or politics and some influence over the government. So I find myself in need of a boyfriend. All pretense, of course.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They turn left to a quiet avenue lined with expensive cars. \u2018You could find a real boyfriend.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy doesn\u2019t look at him. \u2018I\u2019m not one for settling down, Potter. Want to have some fun while I\u2019m young.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry considers the proposition. Will was shocked to see Harry with Malfoy, but there could have been a little jealousy creeping in there. And jealousy is <em>good</em>; jealousy means Will still cares \u2014 a little. A pinprick of light pierces the darkness in his head; suddenly, he\u2019s hopeful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s perfect,\u2019 he says, waiting at the traffic lights. \u2018Will hates Death Eaters. His family had to flee to Norway during the coup to escape attack. He\u2019ll be so pissed off if I\u2019m seeing one.\u2019 Pissed off is good, pissed off means fights, pissed off means <em>not indifference</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy has a rather wooden expression affixed on his face, but the beeping alerts them that the light turned green. They cross the road, turn into a quiet, leafy street and reach a large building with a creamy fa\u00e7ade. Malfoy hasn\u2019t said anything for a while.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018We have to talk more,\u2019 Harry says, \u2018to decide how to do this.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sure,\u2019 Malfoy says. \u2018Look, it\u2019s late, and I\u2019m beat. I\u2019ll owl you.\u2019 He quickly disappears behind the glass doors of his building.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 Astoria says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You can\u2019t do this.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019ll have to pull out of this \u2026 deal.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Salazar, when I\u2019m not with you, Draco, you fuck things up.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco presses his mouth against his pillow and repeats, \u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Come, I\u2019ll cook you breakfast.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Light footsteps thud across the wooden boards. A moment later, cupboards bang in the kitchen and drawers slide open. Draco remains with his face pressed against his pillow and listens to the clang of the frying pan on the stove, the sizzle of sausages, and the murmuring rain on his window. The cooking smells finally drag him out of bed and into the bathroom where he stares at his reflection. He\u2019s coming down something fierce, and he opens his cabinet and finds a half-finished bottle of Pepper-up potion, which dispels the sinking sensation of the drugs in his system, but does nothing for his state of mind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He trudges into the kitchen and sits at the island. The tea Astoria places in front of him is steeped just as he likes it. He takes a grateful sip.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 he says and she laughs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She brings over the plates and sits across from him. \u2018So what happened?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco stares at his eggs and sausages and the swirl of ketchup on the side. \u2018He was upset. He saw Burke with a Quidditch player, all lovey-dovey, and he went white. I feared he\u2019d faint. And I took him out of <em>Blaze</em> and thought that perhaps we could help each other. He can make his ex jealous and I can get my parents off my back.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria gives him the look he hates. He calls it pity, she says it\u2019s sympathy. Bollocks. It\u2019s pity. He hates it as he hates her being the voice of reason right now. \u2018You do know this is a huge mistake. Be around him when he\u2019s mooning for that guy? How masochistic is that?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m aware it means nothing. We haven\u2019t even agreed\u2014\u2019 Draco rubs his face. \u2018If we do go ahead with it, we\u2019ll just turn up to a few events as a couple or something. Nothing too bad. We already sort of hang out together anyway.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And you never speak to him.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco is a semi-regular friend to Potter\u2019s group, especially after Astoria began volunteering at Granger\u2019s pro bono law firm. It could have been worse. Weasley is annoying, but also quite funny since he stopped aiming his jabs at Draco, Granger is sharp and ambitious and he appreciates her brand of ruthlessness, and Lovegood is \u2014 well, she\u2019s Lovegood. She\u2019s entertaining. Longbottom is at Hogwarts and Potter\u2019s other ex is training in Europe more often than not. Draco has made an art of holding conversations with everyone but Potter and making it appear natural, accidental. Sitting beside him at the bar yesterday was a decision he hadn\u2019t made consciously \u2014 or sober.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018He might change his mind about it,\u2019 Draco says, pushing his eggs around. \u2018It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria puts down her fork. \u2018I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt. And you will be. This is a mistake,\u2019 she repeats as if Draco hasn\u2019t heard her the first million times. \u2018If he contacts you, tell him you were drunk and high.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I <em>was</em> drunk and high.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Well, there you have it. You were in no position to consent to anything.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They say no more of it. Draco finishes his breakfast and puts some music on. Astoria takes a cup of tea to the living room and opens her books. They both attend a Muggle university, in secret of course, where Astoria is pretending to study European History, but she\u2019s in fact learning to be a Muggle, and Draco is studying architecture. He casts a dishwashing charm and leans on the counter, rubbing his eyes. He should pull himself together; have a shower, or catch up with uni work, but he can\u2019t stop thinking of the way Potter\u2019s hand felt in his.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He\u2019s toweling his hair when the owl comes with an invitation to lunch with his mother.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s a trap,\u2019 Astoria says at once.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Of course it is. Astoria told her parents that he left the ball early because they broke up. His parents must have heard the news, if not everyone by now. Talking with his mother about it is the last thing he wants, but he can never say no to her.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nonetheless, he dresses as a Muggle.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The bistro is all brick walls and chalkboards with specials and house-elves in black aprons. Glass doors lead to an enclosed patio where his mother waits for him, looking exquisite in lilac robes. She smiles warmly at him, even if the smile turns stiff when she takes in his jeans, loose white t-shirt and black beanie.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Look, I bought you a book,\u2019 she says, a gambit that means she has something up her sleeve.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco leafs through it as his mother orders for both of them. It\u2019s a Muggle novel about a doomed love affair and the title suggests forgiveness \u2014 he likes books that tear his heart into pieces and his mother knows it. The fact she shopped from the Muggle section of Flourish and Blotts means he\u2019s not going to enjoy lunch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Muggle</em> is the hottest trend these days and every shop, boutique and restaurant is competing for the most Muggleness. The wireless plays Westlife and Robbie Williams, and Muggle kettles sit side by side on shelves with magical ones. It\u2019s the thing to do now, the way to show to the world that you\u2019re not like <em>them</em>, not like Draco and his ilk, that you were always on the winning side \u2014 even if you weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">So Muggles it is, and damn if any of them venture outside Diagon Alley to check out what Muggles are <em>really</em> like. Muggleness is a curiosity, an exotic fad that will eventually fade and be replaced by a new trend, perhaps Scandinavian ice-magic or Russian peasant folklore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So.\u2019 Draco recognises the determination in his mother\u2019s voice. \u2018You and Astoria decided to end the charade, I hear. Your father and I are quite pleased about it. It doesn\u2019t do to <em>lie,</em> Draco.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco snorts in his wine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018If you\u2019d told us earlier that your preferences lie\u2026 elsewhere, then your father and I would have arranged more suitable matches for you,\u2019 she continues. \u2018And please don\u2019t smoke, you know I detest it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco lights his cigarette, looking into her eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their order comes in, but Draco is staring at his mother. The food is a prop really and he doesn\u2019t want to take his eyes off the game.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She places her napkin on her lap. \u2018You behave like this is something outrageous when we only want you to be happy. Marriage for us isn\u2019t a fickle thing like the Muggles with their divorces\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I see you\u2019ve done your research.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She ignores him. \u2018\u2014it\u2019s a bond of love <em>and</em> magic. It strengthens you; your magical prowess, your physical health, your position in society\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Spare me the lecture, I\u2019ve heard it before,\u2019 Draco cuts her off, aware he\u2019s being rude, and tucks in his mushroom risotto.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She sighs, but follows his example and takes some bites of her salad.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The patio fills gradually with the clinking of silver on china and the tinkling of glasses. Polite murmurs float in the background, soft white noise, and his mother has changed the subject and is talking about the fire leaping ritual he missed. Draco doesn\u2019t let his guard down one inch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Mrs Malfoy!\u2019 a stocky young man exclaims.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Todd!\u2019 she says, delighted. \u2018What a surprise! I thought you were on your Grand Tour!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Back as of last week.\u2019 The man glances at Draco with a speculative look and Draco clutches his fork and gives a look to his mother, which she thoroughly ignores.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Join us, Todd, and tell us all about it! You remember my son, Draco?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco can be very obnoxious when he wants to be. He chain smokes, putting his cigarettes out in his risotto, mocks Todd\u2019s overuse of the word \u201csplendid\u201d, and fifteen minutes later, excuses himself for the loo.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s not that Todd is unattractive per se. It\u2019s that Draco can\u2019t find common ground with those who fled during the war only to return after Voldemort was dispatched. Half of the MacMillans had run off to Switzerland, the Burkes \u2014 including Potter\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 to Norway, the Shafiqs to Morocco, the Selwyns to Germany. The moment his Aunt Bella and the others were busted from Azkaban, most of the pureblood families not involved with the Dark Lord or the Order had packed bags and were gone. Draco doesn\u2019t blame them, he\u2019d have done the same. But he can\u2019t take this soft boy seriously, who\u2019s just come back from Greece and Italy and Egypt, and assumes he has anything in common with Draco.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Todd sends a long look down Draco\u2019s legs as he rises. \u2018Those jayns look nice on you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco doesn\u2019t correct him. He heads inside and finds the manager. \u2018Is there a way to place a Floo call?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Absolutely, sir.\u2019 The man leads him to a private room with a merry fire and a pewter jar of Floo powder. Draco is shaking with \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s rage or frustration or what. He can\u2019t tell his parents that he doesn\u2019t mind marriage as such, in fact he\u2019d be happy to, for all the reasons his mother mentioned, but he can\u2019t lie to himself and pretend he loves someone when he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter\u2019s elf is in the kitchen when Draco sticks his head in, and bows with great deference. He\u2019s quick to fetch his master. Potter\u2019s hair is sticking up all over the place, he looks sleepy, and he\u2019s wearing a threadbare pair of grey joggers and nothing else. Perhaps this was a bad idea.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Malfoy? What\u2019s up?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Can you meet me at the <em>Young Mandrake</em> in, maybe, ten minutes?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter stares, open mouthed. \u2018Why?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you remember us talking yesterday? The \u2026 deal?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 Potter says. He doesn\u2019t seem excited about it, like Draco suspected.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Even if you\u2019re not up for it\u2014 look, I need a favour. Just come pick me up as soon as you can. Be presentable.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Back at the table, Draco proceeds to flirt with Todd, because he\u2019s malicious like that. His mother looks increasingly wary, because she knows her son. Eleven minutes after the Floo call, Potter strides through the glass doors, sees Draco and approaches, looking bemused.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco takes his hand and murmurs a shy \u2018Hey there,\u2019 which makes Potter\u2019s eyes widen ever so slightly. Standing, he grabs his ciggies and basks in his mother\u2019s astonished glare and Todd\u2019s openmouthed shock at seeing Draco holding hands with the saviour. \u2018Thank you for lunch, mother. I\u2019m really sorry, though, I forgot I had a date with Harry. <em>Totally</em> slipped my mind. Will you excuse me?\u2019 He touches Potter\u2019s back lightly and says, \u2018Should we go somewhere else? How about you choose for us, darling?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter looks slightly dumbstruck and Draco furtively pinches his rib.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yeah, yeah, let\u2019s\u2014 Sure, I know a place.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As they leave, Draco turns and says in a sweet voice, \u2018It was <em>splendid </em>meeting you, Todd.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Exiting the bistro, they turn into a side street and Malfoy crunches his packet of cigarettes in his fist. He throws it on the ground with fury. \u2018Not even twenty-four hours. They didn\u2019t even wait<em> twenty-four hours</em> after my supposed break-up to throw me to the wolves.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say that bloke was the <em>wolves</em>,\u2019 Harry says, remembering the freckled round face. \u2018More like a sheep. Who was it?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs. \u2018A Todd. A Ravenclaw in name only.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He strides down the narrow street and, unsure what to do, Harry follows. They pass second-hand bookshops and slightly dodgy apothecaries, delving deep in the back streets of Diagon, drawing looks and murmurs as Harry always does, and Malfoy says, \u2018Given it any thought?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry has. He had a lie-in this morning and woke up feeling relaxed and warm, the morning rain singing outside his window. For a brief, blissful moment, he pretended Will was in the kitchen, cooking breakfast and whistling, about to return to the bedroom to wake Harry up with a kiss and a cup of tea. Then, the <em>Prophet </em>owl arrived and the morning\u2019s bliss vanished. Will and the Spaniard had been papped snogging. Chucking the paper in the fire, Harry lay back in bed, his mind obsessively picturing the kiss, like a wound he couldn\u2019t stop prodding.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He casts a furtive look at Malfoy in his black beanie and Muggle attire. He\u2019s pretty enough to make Will jealous, but Harry doubts anyone will believe the two of them are an item. He has so little in common with someone who drinks his nights away and faffs about all day. Will never warmed up to him those times Malfoy came out with them, called him a \u201cgood for nothing rich playboy\u201d and perhaps he was right \u2014 but then Harry remembers Ron\u2019s face when Hermione announced she was taking Cormac to Slughorn\u2019s Christmas party.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know a place where we can discuss it,\u2019 he says and offers to Side-Along Malfoy to Richmond.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Roebuck pub sits on a hill and looks out over a curve of Thames and an expanse of wet green fields. Inside it\u2019s buzzing with talk. They linger at the bar, checking the pints on offer and ordering chips to share. \u00a0It could be a date.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Page eleven of the <em>Prophet</em> was interesting this morning,\u2019 Malfoy says when they perch on a stand. His mouth crooks, a devilish smile.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry presses his lips. \u2018This makes you happy, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy doesn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u2018Still pining, I see.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018None of your business.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You know,\u2019 Malfoy says, \u2018I fear people won\u2019t believe <em>we</em> can be a couple.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You don\u2019t say.\u2019 Harry deadpans.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re interrupted by the waiter, who brings the chips and a basket of condiments. \u2018Enjoy your meal, lads.\u2019 Neither of them even glance at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Why would I go through with this?\u2019 Harry continues. \u2018Who\u2019d ever believe we\u2019re seeing each other when you can\u2019t keep from insulting me for five minutes?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy drowns half the bowl of chips in ketchup. \u2018You\u2019re right. But you needn\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m a good actor.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry doubts it but says nothing. He pours vinegar over the other half of the bowl. Malfoy mumbles something about peasants.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry shouldn\u2019t really be considering this. It\u2019s mad. It\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s not going to work. He had no time to check in with his friends, although he knows what their advice would be. However, showing up at the charity gala without a date or with some random guy, clearly a last minute resort\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will\u2019s kiss floats back in his mind and he clenches his fists. He\u2019s desperate and when people are desperate, they make deals with the devil.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How is this going to work?\u2019 he asks, eating a chip from his side of the bowl.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy stretches his long legs. He rests one on the bottom of Harry\u2019s stool. \u2018Quid pro quo. I attend one of your parties, you attend one of mine. I pretend to be awfully in love with you, you pretend to be atrociously enamoured with me. My parents back off, your boyfriend seethes with jealousy. Everyone wins.\u2019 He says it lightly, but there is a hint of bitterness in his tone; something Harry can\u2019t quite make out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018We show up together then? Holding hands?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You could put your arm around my waist,\u2019 Malfoy says. \u2018I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t <em>faint</em>.\u2019 He gives a fake shudder and then chuckles, and Harry wants to punch him. It\u2019s all a joke to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What about \u2014 the rest?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy slides an amused look at him. \u2018Do you want to fuck me, Potter?\u2019 His eyes travel down Harry\u2019s body suggestively and he licks his lips.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No! You prick.\u2019 Harry finishes his pint, feeling stupidly flustered. Malfoy\u2019s giving him a headache and he\u2019s not sure he can do this one-on-one for long. But at least in parties, it\u2019s not going to be just them. He hopes. \u2018I meant\u2026 kissing, or, I don\u2019t know, caressing\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He suspects more mockery will be coming from Malfoy and he\u2019s one second away from storming out of this pub and this stupid, <em>stupid</em> idea, but Malfoy surprisingly hesitates. For once, he looks as if he\u2019s giving the matter serious thought. \u2018I\u2019d be down for some hair stroking, back caressing\u2026 Merlin, let\u2019s be daring. If you want, you can grab my arse.\u2019 He picks up the coaster and is making short work of it. Shreds of it fall on their feet. \u2018But no kissing. Not on the lips.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018OK. I wanted to be sure,\u2019 Harry says, watching Malfoy tear a napkin in pieces now. He\u2019s so fucking weird. \u2018It\u2019s good to be clear about these things. I don\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable.\u2019 <em>As I clearly am</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They lapse into silence and for the first time since they walked into the pub, Harry becomes aware of his surroundings. He glances at the wood-panelled walls and leather booths, as if surprised to find himself there. Malfoy has always had the ability to make him forget about anyone else. One of the most common annoyances that plagued Harry after the war \u2014 besides the Potterettes and the WWHPD crowd \u2014 was that Malfoy got on swimmingly with everyone else \u2014 even Ron \u2014 but not him. During evenings out, when Malfoy happened to tag along, he\u2019d talk to everyone except Harry. It\u2019d been Luna who\u2019d first noticed. They were at the Leaky that evening; Malfoy had been at the bar for some time, there was an empty seat beside Harry, and Luna had moved to take it. \u2018He won\u2019t come back otherwise,\u2019 she whispered, making no sense until Harry noticed Malfoy end his conversation with Hannah, take his drink and return to the vacant seat at the other end of the table where two minutes later he had Ron laughing about some piece of gossip. Will had often told Harry to stop worrying about feeling rejected \u2018by a slimy Death Eater\u2019 and assured Harry it was Malfoy\u2019s pathetic attempt to still think of himself as devious and Machiavellian.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy clears his throat. \u2018I was thinking\u2014 it might be a good idea to be seen out and about before the gala. Have a meal together, or drinks. We\u2019re sure to be photographed and, who knows, perhaps we\u2019ll find a way to tolerate each other. Simply by force of habit.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry can\u2019t find fault with this suggestion. They shake on it and arrange to meet in three days\u2019 time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their first \u201cdate\u201d is at a wizarding restaurant in Diagon Alley two doors down from <em>Blaze</em>. Malfoy shows up in Muggle clothing \u2014 Harry realises he hasn\u2019t seen him in robes for quite a while now: slim charcoal suit, narrow trousers and a white shirt open at the collar. He looks like a rock star, his hair styled to look like he just left the bed \u2014 or maybe he did just leave his bed \u2014 and wearing silver rings on his fingers, and well, Harry can\u2019t pretend Malfoy doesn\u2019t look nice, he has <em>eyes</em>. He tries to run a hand through his hair, not that it ever makes a difference, and smoothes his tie, which he now regrets wearing. Next to Malfoy, he feels frumpy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The restaurant is one of those which have jumped on the Muggle bandwagon and Barry White croons from the speakers; the owners probably consider it mellow enough for eating. Harry blames the music for the thoughts that run in his head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So why so keen on Burke?\u2019 Malfoy asks him once they order. \u2018Does he have a huge cock or something?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Can you shut up?\u2019 Harry glances around but no one seems to have heard. \u2018We were together for eighteen months. We lived together for a year. Is it so hard to understand that I might have feelings?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco shrugs. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t know. Feelings aren\u2019t my <em>forte.</em>\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Blowjobs in the gents\u2019 is what does it for you then?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, sometimes it\u2019s a cock up my arse. It depends on the bloke, I guess. You know.\u2019 His eyes are keen on Harry\u2019s. \u2018I saw you at the clubs a few times. At Trade, G.A.Y., Love Muscle. The scene too much for you? Couldn\u2019t handle random blokes touching the saviour\u2019s sacred cock?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Fuck off. Just because\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The waitress pauses by their table, holding their starters, and stares in astonishment at Harry\u2019s vitriolic tone, and Harry worries he\u2019s fucked everything up before it\u2019s even started. She glances at Malfoy, who smiles back, gloriously unconcerned. \u2018Not to worry. I like him like that,\u2019 he confesses, voice low and sexy. His expression becomes sultry, so lustful and intense that Harry feels his blood boiling, especially when Malfoy turns from the waitress and casts that look on him. Harry feels thrown back by the force of the longing and lust in Malfoy\u2019s eyes, his skin scorching as Malfoy\u2019s gaze glides over him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s a good actor after all. The waitress stares gobsmacked at this blatant expression of sexual attraction, her mouth in a small o. Her eyes on Harry light up with a new appreciation, as if Malfoy\u2019s look has revealed something about Harry she never suspected, and she whispers something along the lines of \u2018I get what the Potterettes see in you\u2019.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry is unable to tear his eyes from Malfoy\u2019s expression, which turns cold and ferocious when the waitress leaves. \u2018You fucking imbecile,\u2019 Malfoy hisses. \u2018You have such a pole up your arse that you can\u2019t even take a joke.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Everything\u2019s a joke for you,\u2019 Harry throws back. \u2018Not for me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You know shit about me, Potter.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This looks like it\u2019ll end in a fist fight with Barry White singing about the trouble with him, but Malfoy sighs, shifts in his seat and picks up his fork. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. Not everyone likes casual sex. I get it. I\u2019m not a huge fan either, but it\u2019s not like I have a choice.\u2019 He stabs at his pigeon and blackcurrant terrine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Tension diffused, curiosity takes its place. Harry picks up his tomato and basil bruschetta and asks, \u2018Why don\u2019t you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hmmm, not <em>sure</em> if you remember, but once upon a time I allied myself with the wrong side. Got myself almost thrown in prison for it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018There\u2019s no need for sarcasm,\u2019 Harry says, rubbing his temple. Conversation with Malfoy <em>is </em>a fist fight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s eyes flick on his gesture. He sits back. \u2018I apologise. It\u2019s hard to\u2014 I find it hard to be \u2026 open with you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018But that\u2019s how we should be with each other,\u2019 Harry insists. \u2018So we can sell this.\u2019 Malfoy lowers his eyes on his plate. Harry continues, \u2018Have you thought about dating a Muggle?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy smiles ruefully. \u2018Unfortunately, although I devote a large part of my time to London clubs and the King\u2019s Road shops, I suspect I\u2019m unable to spend half an hour talking to a Muggle without breaking the Statute. And \u2014 you might think it\u2019s offensive \u2014 but I can\u2019t picture myself with a Muggle forever. A chasm separates us. Not to mention the magic of the betrothal won\u2019t work with a Muggle. It\u2019s wizards for me, I\u2019m afraid, and those who fought during the war hate me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That Todd was keen,\u2019 Harry points out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Ah, the dates my parents select! Inane conversations about where to summer and which tailor makes the best robes. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine I have anything in common with people who weren\u2019t here during the war.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This admission stirs memories in Harry. God, the fights he and Will had about the same issue. The gnawing, nagging suspicion that Will would never <em>get</em> it. What it\u2019d been like for Harry and his friends; for every one of his peers actually. They might have put the war behind them, but it\u2019s not <em>gone</em>; it\u2019s simply buried inside them, dormant. Malfoy might not have been on his side, but he <em>knows</em>. He met Voldemort and was touched by him almost as much as Harry was.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps they do have something in common after all.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The waitress reappears, checking first to make sure they\u2019re not at each other\u2019s throats again, bringing the mains and a fresh bottle of wine.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019ve changed,\u2019 Harry says. \u2018Hermione wouldn\u2019t be friendly with you if you hadn\u2019t. Eventually, someone you like will see that and ask you out.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Stranger things have happened,\u2019 Malfoy says and changes the subject to Harry\u2019s job. For once the conversation ticks along smoothly, Harry talking about arrests and successful convictions and Malfoy appearing genuinely interested.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Night has fallen when they leave the restaurant. Music is pumping from <em>Blaze</em> further down the street and Malfoy gestures towards it. \u2018Let me buy you a drink. Come on. It\u2019s still early.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It isn\u2019t really, considering tomorrow is Thursday and Harry has to work, but he imagines any time is OK for someone who probably spends his days doing fuck-all. Still, he follows Malfoy to <em>Blaze,</em> which is busy, but not heaving. They grab a sofa, and a smart looking young man takes their order. The music is a seamless blend of wizarding and Muggle, and curious looks stray towards them. Blaise Zabini is holding court by the bar in a striking red suit and he waves at Malfoy, frowning a little when he sees Harry with him. Harry can\u2019t blame him. It <em>is </em>surprising.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Maybe the papers will stop sliding sly digs about him being dumped and concentrate on this new shocking development. He laughs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What\u2019s funny?\u2019 Malfoy asks. He\u2019s sprawled on the sofa, languid and golden in the light of <em>Blaze</em>\u2019s ornate lamps. His unbuttoned shirt stretches to reveal the sharp angle of his collarbone. Harry momentarily forgets what he was about to say. He taps his fingers on his glass to dispel his nervousness.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m laughing because this \u2014 our being together \u2014 is one of the most horrendous things I\u2019ve done after the war. For the papers. <em>I </em>don\u2019t think it\u2019s horrendous,\u2019 he clarifies when Malfoy\u2019s face tenses. \u2018I mean, we\u2019re friends. Friend-ish. Anyway.\u2019 He clenches his glass \u2014 Malfoy\u2019s attention is wholly on him and it makes him edgy \u2014 and blurts out something he tells few people. \u2018They\u2019ve been painting me as this perfect guy ever since the war and it\u2019s suffocating. I <em>hate</em> the word saviour. You can\u2019t imagine how much. That\u2019s why I snapped at you. The expectations\u2026 Those WWHPD people do my nut in with their pins and their leaflets \u2014 and if I leave the bar drunk or something, if I snog some bloke and never owl them, I get so much shit about it. As if I\u2019m <em>disappointing</em> people when I just want to \u2014 live.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He doesn\u2019t know if Malfoy will make fun of his confession. Harry\u2019s probably had quite a bit to drink. It dawns on him how quiet it is, the roar of the chatter distant; Malfoy\u2019s probably cast a Silencio without Harry realising. It emboldens Harry to continue. \u2018That\u2019s why I like going out in the Muggle world. There, I\u2019m allowed to make mistakes. I don\u2019t have to pretend I\u2019m perfect.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In Zabini\u2019s mood lighting, Malfoy\u2019s gaze seems warm, almost tender. He knocks back his drink. \u2018Stick with me, kid. No one knows you're not perfect better than I do. Let\u2019s do shots.\u2019 He gestures at their waiter and gives Harry a dazzling, teasing grin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry laughs. When he complained to his friends, Hermione had considered legal solutions, Ron had suggested they never step foot in Diagon Alley bars again and Ginny had offered to blow up the <em>Prophet</em> offices in the dead of night. Trust Malfoy to offer to lead him to debauchery.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It was a source of strife between Will and me,\u2019 Harry admits twenty minutes later, empty shot glasses on the table and both leaning back on the sofa. His shoulder is touching Malfoy\u2019s and Malfoy hasn\u2019t moved away, but Harry supposes he\u2019d better get used to it. For the time being, this is what it\u2019ll be like for them: shoulders touching and thighs pressed to one another.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy tilts his head towards him. \u2018Hm?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018My reluctance to socialise in the magical world.\u2019 He gestures at the space in front of them, the witches and wizards chatting animatedly, pixie dust raining from the ceiling. \u2018He begged me to go to that restaurant. He\u2019ll be pissed off I went without him.\u2019 The thought cheers him up.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Speak of the devil\u2026\u2019 Malfoy says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry follows his gaze to a departing group of people, which leaves an unobstructed view towards a table at the back. Two men are gazing lovingly in each other\u2019s eyes. Harry\u2019s face heats up, his chest tight. \u2018Nibble my ear.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I mean\u2014 If-if you\u2019re OK with this?\u2019 Harry\u2019s not sure if ear-nibbling falls in the jurisdiction of kissing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy hesitates but only briefly. A light in his eyes makes him look feverish. He leans closer, nuzzles Harry\u2019s neck, his breath hot on his skin, and Harry closes his eyes for a moment. It feels good; god, it\u2019s been a while. Malfoy licks his earlobe, smiling against his skin when Harry gasps. Harry moves closer and his hand brushes Malfoy\u2019s thigh. He can\u2019t remember if Malfoy had included thighs as areas to be touched, but reckons he\u2019ll leave his hand there, since Malfoy\u2019s not complaining. <em>No snogging</em>, that was the one thing Malfoy objected to, really.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will\u2019s golden-brown curls gleam as the light falls on his face, illuminating his soft stubble and long eyelashes. He and his date are standing now, preparing to leave. He\u2019s a handsome man. Everything Harry could want: twenty-eight years old, educated, with a job that helps people, and not a Death Eater. He cooks well and has a dog and \u2014 <em>oh,</em> Malfoy\u2019s biting his ear now\u2026 Harry\u2019s brain stutters to a halt. Will\u2019s ear licking was perfunctory; a couple of strokes before he moved lower. Malfoy\u2019s licking his neck and ear as if he\u2019s worshipping them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fuck, he\u2019s feeling aroused now. He links his hand with Malfoy\u2019s, wanting to tell him to stop maybe, take a break, take a breather, but Malfoy misunderstands and splays his other hand on Harry\u2019s throat, holding him in place with open fingers, while his mouth is working Harry\u2019s neck. Harry gasps, and squeezes Malfoy\u2019s hand and Malfoy moans in his ear.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He almost misses it, but Will\u2019s looking at him. Harry meets Will\u2019s eyes, an almost smile on his lips. Will\u2019s thunderstruck, glaring at Malfoy as if Malfoy killed his mother, which, since Harry knows all of Malfoy\u2019s intended or not victims, he didn\u2019t. So he\u2019s jealous. He drags Joaquin with him out of the bar, the door banging behind them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry exhales and turns to Malfoy, an action which brings him close to his face. He can feel his smoky breath on his mouth, and gives Malfoy a lazy, blissful smile. The look he gets in return is heated, similar to the one Malfoy pulled to convince the waitress that he likes cranky Harry. His fingers are still on Harry\u2019s neck, soft, stroking him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s working,\u2019 Harry says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy removes his hand. It\u2019s shaking as he reaches for his drink on the low table. \u2018Of course it is. I knew what I was talking about.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You know,\u2019 Harry says, his hand lingering on Malfoy\u2019s back when they leave the bar, \u2018after all this we might even become friends.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s back in scathing mode. \u2018That statement\u2019s made my day, it has.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s too mellow to feel insulted. \u2018Idiot.\u2019 Harry bumps his shoulder and smiles, and Malfoy reluctantly smiles back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The next evening, Harry finds Ron in the kitchen making jam, a pastime he got into after Fred\u2019s funeral and has now developed into a full-fledged obsession. When he\u2019s not at the joke shop, Ron can be found fondling fruit at the Borough Market or bent over a steaming, fragrant pot, eyes intent on the bubbly surface. Hermione has long since given up complaining about the astounding number of jars cramming their pantry, although she makes a point of bringing two to Harry each time they visit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Is it jam today again?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s their inside joke. Ron often talks of opening a tiny shop next to the joke shop, \u2018a few shelves and a counter is all I need\u2019, or a stall in one of the London markets, and Hermione was the one who suggested \u201cJam Today\u201d as the name of the hypothetical company. She\u2019s been reading her childhood books to him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Cranberry and port,\u2019 Ron says, peering inside the copper pot. The surface of the jam looks glossy and thick, which means it\u2019s almost ready. \u2018Perfect for Christmas morning.\u2019 He is poised over the pot with a wooden spoon, alert and focused, a hand on the heating knob.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019ll wait for when you\u2019re done.\u2019 Harry wanders into the living room. It\u2019s raining again, wind blowing through the bare trees outside, but the fire is lit, \u00a0Oasis follow the Weird Sisters on the wireless and two table lamps cast a soft light in the room. Hermione is bent over a stack of letters, loose parchment and cut-up articles, her wand hovering over her, casting a beam of bright light towards different parts of parchment. She follows the wand\u2019s movements, biting her lip. Astoria is on the carpet, flicking through a pile of files and putting them in order, before she levitates them to the groaning bookcase in the corner.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry kisses Hermione. \u2018Still working on the creature abuse case? Hey, Astoria.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hey.\u2019 Astoria gives him a bright smile, her nose piercing glinting in the lamp light. Harry likes her a lot. She\u2019s cheerful and passionate about the same causes that Hermione is and he has no idea how she\u2019s friends with Malfoy. \u2018How was your date yesterday?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Date?\u2019 Hermione looks up, intrigued. Her wand clatters on the table.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s nothing,\u2019 Harry tells her. \u2018It\u2019s not <em>real</em>.\u2019 He glances at Astoria, who\u2019s looking at him intently. \u2018You must know, right? Me and Malfoy. We\u2019re faking it. He\u2019s going to be my date at the Christmas charity gala.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Huh,\u2019 Hermione frowns when he explains. \u2018Couldn\u2019t you have asked him as a friend? Like you did with Luna? This sounds awfully complicated and time consuming\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry leans forward. \u2018But this way I can make Will jealous,\u2019 he says, his voice eager. He tells them about the night before and how upset Will looked. \u2018Who knows? He might\u2026 he might\u2026\u2019 He doesn\u2019t say what Will might do (<em>get back together with him</em>), because he can hardly admit it to himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He doesn\u2019t need to. A reflective look on Hermione makes him regret he opened his mouth, but Ron saves him. He runs into the living room with the wooden spoon. \u2018Try this.\u2019 He gives everyone a taste. Harry smacks his lips. Ron\u2019s come a long way in jam making.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s ready, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Ron asks Hermione, who knows, through prolonged experience, when jam is done.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Take it off the heat,\u2019 she agrees and Ron runs back to the kitchen.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Hermione sits back and wraps her knitted blue cardigan around herself. \u2018I can see why making Will jealous might appeal to you, but it\u2019s not like you want to get back together.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry says nothing. He stares at Hermione\u2019s collection of wooden statuettes and ceramic animals, which Crookshanks likes to knock off the shelves. Ron\u2019s told him Hermione likes to rearrange the order when she\u2019s thinking about a case.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Harry!\u2019 She insists he look at her. \u2018Don\u2019t you remember those last three months? You argued all the time. Will wants different things\u2014 he likes being in the thick of wizarding life, and you don\u2019t, not really.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I might be OK with wizarding things,\u2019 he lies. \u2018I can compromise.\u2019 He stares at his fingers now, listening to the crackling fire and the shuffling of paper. Astoria murmurs something about filing. A long moment passes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco eh? I thought he didn\u2019t like you,\u2019 Hermione says. \u2018He\u2019s hard to read, though\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, he certainly doesn\u2019t like me much,\u2019 Harry agrees. \u2018But he has his reasons, too.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco is prickly when he feels nervous,\u2019 Astoria chimes from the floor. \u2018If he feels threatened or insecure in some way, he\u2019ll go on the offensive. He\u2019s like a hedgehog.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hedgehogs are cute!\u2019 Hermione laughs. \u2018I used to have a couple of ceramic ones\u2026\u2019 She glares at Crookshanks, lying by the hearth and looking superbly unrepentant.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco\u2019s Patronus is a hedgehog,\u2019 Astoria blurts out and covers her mouth with her hands. \u2018Shit, don\u2019t tell him I told you that! He\u2019ll murder me!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry and Hermione are laughing too hard to listen to her. Ron finally comes in, wiping his sweaty brow. \u2018I cast the potting charm and it\u2019s\u2026 wait for it\u2026 <em>jam today</em>!\u2019 He chuckles at his joke and notices them giggling. \u2018What\u2019s so funny?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Half an hour later, Ron and Harry sit by the fire with a cider, allowing the two women to get on with work. The talk revolves around the joke shop and the Ministry until the <em>Evening Prophet</em> owl knocks on the window. Astoria browses through the paper and hands it to Harry. \u2018Check you two out.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The photograph takes most of the page. He and Malfoy are leaving the restaurant last night, close to each other, but not touching. The article describes the date in some detail, including Harry\u2019s \u201cviolent\u201d outburst that the \u201cclearly disturbed former Death Eater seemed to find arousing\u201d. That waitress must have talked. He\u2019d sue if it made any difference. People always talk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hands it to Ron.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s been a while since you were papped,\u2019 Ron says. \u2018Are you sure this is a good idea? You\u2019re doing this for Will, when you should be moving on. Looking to the future, not the past.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry stares at the fire. \u2018I miss what we had,\u2019 he confesses. \u2018I want to go home and find someone\u2014 I don\u2019t know, making jam or spreading their papers all over the place\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hates the longing in his voice, and how <em>understanding </em>Ron\u2019s eyes look. \u2018You\u2019ll find it. But only if you take your eyes off your ex for a moment, eh?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry shrugs. He knows all this, he\u2019s not stupid. But what his mind is explaining rationally is a whole different beast to what his heart and body are driving him to do. In his darkest moments, he dreams of Will crawling on his feet and begging to be taken back, only for Harry to laugh and declare he feels nothing. He hates that he feels like that. So mean and petty.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ron clears his throat. \u2018I-uh, I\u2019m thinking of asking Hermione to \u2026 um\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He doesn\u2019t have to say more. \u2018Really?\u2019 Harry beams. \u2018That\u2019s amazing! That\u2019s beyond amazing!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019re the first I\u2019ve told,\u2019 Ron exhales. \u2018I feel ready. Shit. Will you come with me for a ring?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry gives him a look, which has Ron chuckling. \u2018Yeah, I know, me neither. No idea about rings.\u2019 He hesitates and says, \u2018Do you think Malfoy might have a clue? He must, he\u2019s posh, innit? And he\u2019s fashionable\u2026\u2019 He casts a look at the paper on the carpet, where Malfoy looks like a star and Harry like his assistant.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sure, owl him.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s getting late and Harry and Astoria are saying their goodbyes when the fire flares emerald and Ginny appears. \u2018Hey, brother of mine!\u2019 She steps on the carpet, tossing ash and scaring the kneazle. \u2018Hi, everyone!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Astoria, this is Ginny,\u2019 Hermione says. \u2018Don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met yet.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019ve certainly heard <em>of</em> you,\u2019 Astoria drawls in an accent reminiscent of the one Malfoy uses when he\u2019s insulting Harry. She casts an eye over Ginny\u2019s plaid t-shirt and ripped jeans as she offers her hand.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ginny takes it. \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been flying with the Lux Vixens for the last couple of years,\u2019 she smiles. \u2018That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come,\u2019 she turns to Ron, not quite dropping Astoria\u2019s hand. \u2018I\u2019m going back tomorrow and wanted to say goodbye.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She hugs Harry (\u2018it\u2019ll get easier, mate, promise,\u2019 she whispers in his ear) and releases him with a smack on the cheek. Harry can\u2019t stand the Floo so he takes the stairs to Apparate past the building\u2019s wards. Astoria follows him, wrapping herself in her fake-fur coat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At the street, she scuffs her boot on the ground before turning to him. \u2018Give him a chance.\u2019 At Harry\u2019s questioning look, she adds, \u2018Draco. See past whatever he\u2019s \u2026 projecting. Get to know him. I think you\u2019d be surprised.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s Saturday, three days after the fake date, and Draco can\u2019t stop thinking about Potter\u2019s ear. It\u2019s irritating and distracting and making his limbs heavy, his brain fuzzy. He\u2019s wanked to the memory of nuzzling Potter\u2019s skin for days now. It\u2019s frankly ridiculous. It\u2019s just an ear, no big fucking deal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Blaise gives him a nudge with his foot and Draco tries to focus. He\u2019s at brunch with him, Pansy, Daphne and Duncan and he\u2019s listened to only a third of the conversation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I always knew it\u2019d happen,\u2019 Pansy is saying now. She casts an eye at Draco and smiles. \u2018Should\u2019ve put money on it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Knew what?\u2019 he asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You dating Potter. It all makes sense. He was crazy about you, even in school. Couldn\u2019t leave you well alone.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco almost chokes on his mimosa. He\u2019s decided to confide only to Blaise about the true nature of his relationship. He knows Pansy and Daphne will tell Millie, even if they swear to keep it a secret; and Millie tells her girlfriend, Tracey<em>, everything</em>, and Tracey is the biggest gossip in town. Draco suspects she\u2019s behind the Blind Items in the society pages every Sunday.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Deep down Draco would like to be a Blind Item, but for something like \u201cGuess which astonishingly handsome Slytherin the Boy Who Lived has gone and fallen for\u201d rather than \u201cDisgraced former Death Eater fakes relationship since no one will ever love him\u201d.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He ignores Pansy\u2019s self-satisfied smirk. \u2018Can we go back to your nattering about your honeymoon? Traitor.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Pansy smiles. \u2018You\u2019d be Mrs Cadwallader, too, if you knew the size of Eurig\u2019s\u2026\u2019 Daphne sniggers and Pansy bats innocent eyelashes, \u2018What? I was going to say <em>heart</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That\u2019s not a reason to marry a Hufflepuff,\u2019 Draco objects, but Blaise gives him a look.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018People do stupid things when they\u2019re in love. <em>Truly idiotic</em>.\u2019 His eyes on Draco are fierce and Draco resists the temptation to squirm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So tell us,\u2019 Daphne leans in. \u2018Is Potter a good kisser?\u2019 Duncan makes a noise to indicate objection as to the direction this conversation is taking, but it\u2019s just for show; he\u2019s listening eagerly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018We haven\u2019t kissed yet.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Are you <em>serious</em>?\u2019 Pansy asks, eyebrows rising. \u2018I\u2019d have thought <em>you</em>\u2019d be shagging him halfway through the first date.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Daphne and Duncan are nodding and why the fuck does Duncan think he has anything to say about this. He wasn\u2019t even in school with them. Draco blows smoke in his face, <em>accidentally</em>, because Duncan is a health-nut and hates smoking. His family\u2019s distilleries will go wasted on him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m taking it slow,\u2019 Draco says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Blaise decides to spare him, and draws attention back to himself. They haven\u2019t talked about him for the last thirty minutes, he must be suffering. \u2018I\u2019ve got news,\u2019 he announces. Pansy, for some reason, sits up straighter. \u2018I\u2019m taking the next step. Opening a club. Something glamorous and sexy and totally decadent. A type of establishment sorely missing from the array of dingy nightclubs one finds in Knockturn Alley. I\u2019ve got a construction crew on it as we speak, and our lovely Mrs Cadwallader here,\u2019 Pansy simpers, \u2018will be managing it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They all go <em>ooh </em>and <em>aah</em> over the news and Draco\u2019s back to his daydreaming of Potter\u2019s ear when a spectacled owl drops a parchment on his eggs benedict. He scans the note and hisses. \u2018Mother!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Throwing some Galleons on the table, he makes his excuses.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter is staring at his invitation when Draco tracks him down at \u00a0Quidditch practice. They\u2019re on a break. Oliver Wood is talking with the Head Auror, making wild gestures to explain a feint and the Head Auror\u2019s nodding earnestly, his jowls moving.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Oh, Draco,\u2019 Potter says. \u2018I got\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You said.\u2019 Potter\u2019s teammates and colleagues are not-so-furtively looking at them so Draco kisses him quickly on the cheek to keep up appearances. \u2018I had no idea Mother would do this. I\u2019ll go have a word with her right now.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The invitation is from the Nithercotts,\u2019 Potter says, who is obviously clueless.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yes, Mrs Nithercott invited you <em>plus one</em>, but she\u2019s a Pu.Fo.P. like my mother.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018A \u2026 pooffup?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco rolls his eyes. \u2018They\u2019re both on the board of <em>Purebloods For Peace</em>. I bet my mother made her invite you to see if I\u2019d be your plus one.\u2019 He grabs Potter\u2019s hands, which startles him and Draco both. Potter\u2019s windswept and sweaty and looks\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Well, never mind that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You don\u2019t have to go. Please disregard this. Ignore Mrs Nithercott and her stupid orphans.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Her orphans?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shit. \u2018She runs an orphanage. Her parties sometimes have performances by the kids or raise money by selling the children\u2019s artwork or some rot like that\u2026\u2019 He can tell by Potter\u2019s look that he\u2019s fighting a losing battle.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter glances at the invitation again. \u2018I\u2019ve never been invited to a <em>musical soiree</em> before. It sounds like it\u2019s for a worthwhile cause.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Worthwhile, my arse. The dress robes of the women on the board could fund the orphanage\u2019s yearly expenses.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry shrugs. \u2018I guess I\u2019ll go and see. Besides, I owe you one, don\u2019t I? Quid pro quo. I\u2019ll take you as my plus one.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018My <em>mother</em> will be there,\u2019 Draco grits out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know your mother. She helped me once.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco rolls his eyes. Potter has no idea what he\u2019s getting himself into.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s not until the thirteenth,\u2019 Potter notes. \u2018That\u2019s two weeks away. Nothing to worry about.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s laughter is a little hysterical.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Probably wanting to sell the dating thing, Potter asks him to stay and watch the practice if he wants, and Draco has nothing better to do, so he agrees. He huddles on the cold bleachers, casting the warmest charm he can, and watches the Aurors train. Aurors tend to be in far better shape than the Healers, but only those who didn\u2019t lose an arm or a leg in action so the pool of selection for the team is smaller. Potter is the only decent player and Robards as a Keeper is simply ghastly. Wood is looking pretty desperate. Draco suspects the Healers will thrash them and makes a note to himself to place some bets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An hour later, the players are exhausted, Wood is hoarse and Draco has dozed off in his heat bubble. Something shakes him and he opens his eyes to see a pink Potter over him, his hand on his shoulder. He\u2019s grinning. \u2018Was practice that exciting?\u2019 Potter offers a hand and pulls Draco up. \u2018Wanna grab a bite?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco can\u2019t think of a reason to refuse so he doesn\u2019t. He has nothing better to do, anyway, since Astoria is taking some girl to the cinema tonight and his other friends will have finished brunch and will be spending time with their spouses. Besides, Potter might need to parade his fake boyfriend if they go to Diagon.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It doesn\u2019t make his wait at the reception less nerve-wracking. He taps his fingers on his jeans. Last time he behaved like a total dick and he knows he has the tendency to say the first thing on his mind, which is usually the most unkind.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Perhaps we\u2019ll end up friends</em>, Potter had said the other day. Hanging out with him might even push Potter off the pedestal Draco has him on. He\u2019ll see all Potter\u2019s faults, of which he\u2019s sure to have many. In fact, the way he sees it, Draco\u2019s bound to fall out of love within a week. Nothing to be nervous about.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter strides out of the locker room, his hair damp and curling on the nape of his neck. He smiles at Draco, his eyes bright.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Your team is pathetic. You\u2019ll be annihilated,\u2019 Draco says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter is startled, but he snorts. \u2018Don\u2019t let my boss catch you saying that.\u2019 He offers an arm for Side-Along. \u2018Chinese OK?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They Apparate not to a restaurant, like Draco expected, but into a living room with a tapestry of a sprawling genealogical tree covering one wall. Potter asks him about his preferences, \u2018I eat everything,\u2019 says Draco, which is a blatant lie, and stays in the middle of the carpet when Potter heads out of the room. Draco feels at ease with the snake candelabras and hissing door knobs, the silk green wallpaper and antique sideboard, but at the same time averse towards the part of him he\u2019s trying so hard to leave behind. The name of his mother on the tapestry catches his eye next to Aunt Bella\u2019s; he turns his back to them. He can\u2019t find a trace of Potter in the room, except perhaps the stack of books on Defense on the shelf from his Auror training.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter returns, apologetic. \u2018Had to go to the roof to make the call. Phones don\u2019t work in this house. Too magical.\u2019 He flops on the sofa and gestures at Draco to take a seat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know.\u2019 Draco removes his black coat and chunky scarf and hands them to the elderly house-elf, who pops in the room to take them, looking rather grumpy. When he pops out of the room, Potter explains that his elf hates it when he orders takeaway. \u2018Believes he should be doing all the cooking. But he won\u2019t take a holiday, no matter how much I insist.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco sits far from Potter. \u2018My building has its own house-elf team. One of them comes in twice a week.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Is it a wizarding building?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yes,\u2019 Draco says. \u2018But I\u2019ve a magic-proof den where I keep my TV and phone.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter\u2019s staring at him in an odd manner. Probably because Draco is feeling too shaky by the fact they\u2019re alone in Potter\u2019s house to be his usual self. \u2018I still can\u2019t get over the fact that I\u2019m talking about these Muggle things with you, of all people.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco shrugs. They discuss Wood\u2019s probable descent into depression due to the Auror team for a while before Potter Disapparates to pick up their order from the Muggle shop and returns carrying enough food for five. He spreads the containers on the low table, pushing aside a \u2014 possibly priceless \u2014 porcelain vase with little care. The house-elf provides a bottle of wine, glaring at the food as if he wants to incinerate it with his eyes. Draco gradually relaxes. The fire keeps the room toasty and the sounds of the city die down as night falls in a hurry. He can\u2019t stop his heart from beating fast every time Potter glances at him, but he\u2019s used to that.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What are you so happy about?\u2019 Draco asks. A smile has been playing on Potter\u2019s lips as they eat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At Draco\u2019s words, it turns melancholic. \u2018We \u2014 me and Will \u2014 used to have Chinese food on Saturdays. Pasta on Tuesdays and Indian on Thursdays \u2014 when our shift schedule allowed us to be both at home for dinner, which wasn\u2019t often, to be honest.\u2019 He stops and peers into his wine glass.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018When was blowjob day? Was rimming part of the weekly schedule or a treat for Christmas and birthdays?\u2019 Draco wants to kick himself.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter purses his lips. \u2018Must you be so vulgar?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I must. It\u2019s my one talent. A blessing and a curse.\u2019 Draco keeps his tone light, to take the sting off his earlier words, to show he was joking.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter still looks unhappy. \u2018You might think my life was dull. But\u2014 I never had a home before. My childhood home never felt like one, not like Hogwarts did. But that was my school. This place,\u2019 he takes in the dim, ornate room, \u2018is the house I own, but doesn\u2019t feel like much of a home. Not like I\u2019d always dreamed of. And then with Will\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He glances at Draco and stops. \u2018You\u2019ll make fun of me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, I won\u2019t.\u2019 Draco\u2019s voice comes out earnest, keen. He\u2019s riveted by this insight into Potter\u2019s psyche. He\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d have the privilege to be a party to Potter\u2019s confidences.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His tone of voice must have encouraged Potter, who bites into a spring roll. Chewing (<em>that\u2019s</em> vulgar, Draco\u2019s upbringing reminds him), he says, \u2018Will\u2019s flat felt like a home pretty early on. Perhaps because I lived with someone I cared about. That\u2019s what I miss the most. Having a <em>home</em>.\u2019 He thinks, chewing on another roll. \u2018This place did feel better when Ron and Hermione lived with me. Now they\u2019re over at Kilburn.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco wants to offer something in return for this confession. Quid pro quo. \u2018I\u2019ve always had a home. But then that home was\u2014\u2019 Judging by Potter\u2019s look, he understands what Draco wants to say. \u2018When I came into my own vault last year, the one held in trust for me\u2026\u2019 \u2014 Merlin, Draco is<em> exactly </em>like the people he despises \u2014 \u2018I bought my flat in Knightsbridge and am slowly making it mine. It feels more like a home than the Manor, now.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He eats another bite. \u2018Having Astoria around this past year helped. I\u2019ve given her full access to the wards, she can come and go as she pleases. She used to come and have dinner with me most days of the week. Or we\u2019d walk by the river in the summer. She dragged me to Muggle museums a few times and helped me get a bank account, and\u2014\u2019 So many moments of his life in the last year he shared with her.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He doesn\u2019t want to look at Potter, because it feels idiotic to say this when Potter\u2019s mourning a true break-up. \u2018I know we were pretending to be a couple. We didn\u2019t shag, sure, but we did a lot of things together. And now\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The firelight bounces on Potter\u2019s glasses and makes it impossible for Draco to see the look in his eyes. Potter\u2019s been very still while Draco poured his heart out, and he wishes it didn\u2019t make him so tense. He feels like he should make a rude joke, insult Potter\u2019s green jumper or something.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Wanna go clubbing tonight?\u2019 Potter asks. \u2018I\u2019m meeting Hermione and Ron for drinks in a couple of hours in Angel.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco exhales. Clubbing is something he can deal with. \u2018Tell me when and where.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The noise is loud so Harry has to lean close to Ron\u2019s ear. \u2018Did you ask Malfoy to help you pick a ring?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I did. But he can only do Friday afternoon or the weekend. We\u2019re going Friday.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What the fuck does he have to do all day that he can only do Fridays?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ron doesn\u2019t respond to that and Harry glances at Malfoy chatting with Hermione, grinning as Malfoy tells her some joke. Harry had never expected this. The world after the war is a topsy-turvy place, a dark mirror of what life was before. He recalls the Incident, as he and Ron call it, during the early days of the P.Re.S. campaign. He\u2019d been with Ron at\u00a0<em>The Ticklish Thestral </em>in Hammersmith when Hermione\u2019s owl arrived, saying she was fine but wouldn\u2019t come home that night. They\u2019d run to her office to find it locked, Silenced, fully warded. They\u2019d waited outside for hours; Ron even dozed on the carpet. Harry, Kingsley, Ron, everyone tried to break in, but the door wouldn\u2019t budge until, late on Saturday, Malfoy stormed out red-eyed and ghostly pale, his mouth twitching, and Ron dashed inside to find a deflated Hermione. She never told them what they\u2019d discussed for almost sixteen\u00a0hours in a locked room, why Malfoy looked like he\u2019d been scraped raw, and why she spent a day in bed afterwards. Whatever it was, it brought them to this.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry glances at his former enemy surreptitiously. Malfoy looks like someone\u2019s wet dream. He wears a shirt, unbuttoned and untucked, over a flimsy grey vest that reveals a lot more of his chest than Harry is comfortable with. He\u2019s not sure why the sight of Malfoy\u2019s nipples when he leans over the bar should irritate him, but they do, especially when they draw the eyes of other men and women in the bar. He\u2019s brazen, unabashed and Harry wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he dragged the barman into the gents\u2019, the way he\u2019s flirting with him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Merlin, Harry needs a shag. It\u2019s been two months and three weeks since his break-up, but he and Will hadn\u2019t had sex for at least the month before. Gulping his drink, Harry takes in the blokes around him, wanting to see if anyone stirs something in him. He feels restless, his skin feverish, too tight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hey, do you want to go to Trade?\u2019 he asks Hermione and Ron, and Malfoy, who\u2019s back from the bar, smiles deviously as he hands out their drinks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve heard you say, Potter,\u2019 he says. \u2018Ever.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It seems that Malfoy knows Laurence Malice, the club promoter, and they\u2019re ushered in without waiting in the queue. It\u2019s as busy as Harry remembers it from his first excursions into gay nightlife; heaving with topless, sweaty men grinding against each other, working boys, girls in bright dresses, Malice himself in a top hat, drag queens in fuchsia wigs. Malfoy, clearly in his element as he secures a corner for them, throws his shirt to Harry and is off dancing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After some Dutch courage, the three of them dive onto the dancefloor. The music is pumping, pummeling Harry and reshaping him. Harry knows how to dance to \u2014 well, to <em>this</em>, this deep funky house that\u2019s fury and passion and something unspeakable that pours out of him along with his sweat. He loses himself in the rhythm, smiling at the men who try to catch his eye, and he dances with one, then another, all of them handsome and attractive, but not what he needs right now. He thinks of his confession to Malfoy and how a realisation had come to him, half-formed and painful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He doesn\u2019t want to think. The music speeds like a train, taking him along for the journey. He sees Ron dancing, oblivious to the looks he gets, and Hermione in conversation with a drag queen, who seems to admire Hermione\u2019s blue and yellow dhuku.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">People move out of the way and suddenly Malfoy is there. The bass thumps like a punch and he gazes, helpless, at Malfoy dancing, his body loose, his limbs moving with a grace that is almost animalistic \u2014 a grace that reminds Harry of panthers and bloodshed, of dark rustling nights, of survival. A grace that he finds himself responding to, moving towards Malfoy, not stopping until he\u2019s close.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He isn\u2019t the only one. Others eye the lithe figure, and one of them, a hunky dark man touches Malfoy\u2019s wrist to get his attention.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s eyes snap open, travel with an indifferent smile over the man and lock onto Harry\u2019s. Ignoring everyone, he approaches Harry.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The music lulls for a moment: a slow melody to allow them to catch their breaths, before the beat starts again, relentless, increasing in ferocity, unstoppable, a beat that gives no mercy, the way Malfoy\u2019s eyes are merciless in their hunger. Harry feels like he\u2019s being eaten alive, that gaze is so familiar, biting into him. He dances with Malfoy, close but not touching, staring at the fair, lightly haired chest, the sweat gathering on Malfoy\u2019s collarbone, gleaming in the lights, the damp vest sticking on his torso, the feel of his expensive jeans under his fingers \u2014 he hadn\u2019t realised he\u2019d moved closer, but Malfoy has his hand lightly on Harry\u2019s waist now, slipping under his t-shirt \u2014 and he drinks in Malfoy\u2019s Marlboro breath and his cedar mixed with sweat scent. A vein pulses on Malfoy\u2019s throat, right in front of Harry\u2019s eyes, so close, and Harry\u2019s breathing hard as the song \u2014 this never ending song \u2014 floods every last one of his arteries. Malfoy smiles, his mouth is parted, a hint of teeth showing, and Harry feels this maddening urge to <em>devour,</em> to bite his fucking neck, and also to be devoured, and he closes his eyes in bliss because there is nothing sweeter than welcoming your own annihilation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When the tune changes, something shifts inside Harry, a tremor of sorts, and he steps away, his hands unsteady. \u2018Going to get a drink,\u2019 he mumbles and walks away without offering one to Malfoy. He downs a whisky in two gulps and tries to drown the fire in the pit of his stomach. He can\u2019t see Malfoy anymore on the dancefloor. His breathing is ragged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A topless man slides near Harry and smiles at him. He\u2019s shorter than Harry, with dark blond curls and the face of an angel. His naked torso is covered in glitter and Harry wants to touch him. The man knows that. He leans in and whispers in Harry\u2019s ear, \u2018You\u2019re absolutely gorgeous, honey.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Emboldened by his proximity and the overt flirtation, Harry trails his hand down the man\u2019s chest, lightly flicking a nipple. He could pursue this. It\u2019d be nothing, just some mindless fun between consenting adults, some way to take the edge off of whatever the fuck\u2019s coursing through his veins.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you want to dance?\u2019 the bloke says again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The word <em>dance</em> reminds him of Malfoy and he squints towards a white blond head on the dancefloor, but can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s Malfoy. He turns to the man. He\u2019s interested and looks delectable, but something about the look on his cherubic face \u2014 sexy, uncomplicated \u2014 gives Harry pause. \u2018No, sorry,\u2019 he says, stepping back.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The man shrugs and moves on, and Harry orders another whisky.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s drunk. He\u2019s washing his glitter-covered fingers in the loo, thinking he might try to track down Ron and Hermione \u2014 he hopes they aren\u2019t doing it in a dark corner, he\u2019s caught eyefuls of quite a few minor acts of debauchery as he was coming here \u2014 when he hears a breathless laugh.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He pauses, the water running cold over his hands.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The low chuckle is heard again, coming from the last stall. Then a gasp; a soft moan and a murmur in a fucking posh accent. None of the other men blink; this isn\u2019t unusual. Harry wouldn\u2019t have cared either, he knows what these places are like, but he can\u2019t move his legs and he has no fucking idea why he\u2019s enraged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He should leave, but he doesn\u2019t. He stays there, ears pricked on the smallest of sounds from that stall, until eventually the door opens and Draco fucking Malfoy stumbles out of it followed by that dark man who\u2019d tried to dance with him. The bloke\u2019s got a geometric tattoo on a shoulder, a tight white vest, and bulging arms. A blissful smile is on Malfoy\u2019s face, not a care in the world, as the man kisses him lightly on the mouth, something Harry isn\u2019t allowed to do. Malfoy turns, notices Harry and freezes for a second before he strides towards the sinks and thrusts his hands under the same tap Harry\u2019s using.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018All right there, Potter?\u2019 he says lightly. \u2018How was your shag?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry is seething and has no idea why. \u2018I\u2019m not in the habit of picking strange men and blowing them in the loos.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Oh? Sorry, did you have a polite conversation with that bloke after you ran your hands all over him? My mistake.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s had it up to here with being constantly mocked by fucking Malfoy. \u2018You think you\u2019re so cool, don\u2019t you?\u2019 he hisses. \u2018Giving it up for just about anybody. Pissing your life away.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s face slams shut like a vault door. \u2018You know <em>shit</em> about me, Potter.\u2019 The ferocity in his eyes is incandescent and Harry almost steps back. \u2018You\u2019re so fucking blind.\u2019 Malfoy storms out of the toilets, leaving Harry to stare at the running water. He rubs his fingertips, but the glitter won\u2019t come off.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco spends all Sunday in front of the TV in his pyjamas, eating junk and ignoring any owls that knock on his window or any Floo alerts. He\u2019d like to spend the whole week like this, wallowing in self-pity with a whiff of self-hatred, but Astoria won\u2019t allow him to skip school, so come Monday he Apparates to Kent Uni.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s a relief being there. Lectures serve as a welcome distraction, and the Muggle campus, untainted by any memories of his real life, is a balm to his blistering soul. Draco keeps his head down, takes copious notes and interacts with no one. At lunch, he buys a bacon sarnie from <em>Essentials</em> and heads down to the stone bench overlooking the labyrinth etched in the grass. It\u2019s a wet day, grey and miserable, and no one without magic is stupid enough to sit outdoors. Only a few rabbits munch on grass and hop away when he walks past. Draco casts a couple of discreet spells and sits crossed-leg on the bench. Canterbury cathedral is visible down the hill and misty woods surround the meadow. The endless space around him, the enormous sky and the view over the rolling countryside, make him breathe a little easier.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He knew it wouldn\u2019t last, he tells himself. It was a foolish idea, born of desire and booze and pure recklessness, and he can\u2019t imagine their pretense will survive this. This savage display of contempt. Draco knows he gives a certain <em>impression</em>, but he\u2019d hoped that Potter might have seen past it. What a ridiculous thought.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Biting into the sarnie, he takes out his sketchbook. His pencil moves with his breathing and eventually he\u2019s absorbed, lost in the angles of the structure that emerges on the paper, like a photograph developing, inch by inch.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He\u2019d thought he and Potter had something \u2014 something that was <em>real</em>, because in the Muggle club there was no need to pretend. Potter danced with him and touched his hip and looked at him with dark, hankering eyes and Draco hoped that\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Well. Potter soon put paid to that idea by flirting with a rando. Newly single, he probably wants to have fun, and Draco can\u2019t blame him, but. But it\u2019d hurt, nonetheless.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the evenings, he stays in his flat. November has slid into December, and the night sparkles gold and red outside his windows. After two days, Blaise shows up in his fireplace, worried. Draco hasn\u2019t missed three nights in a row since the bar opened. He doesn\u2019t say \u2018I told you so\u2019, although he clearly thinks it, and returns to <em>Blaze</em> once Draco assures him that he\u2019ll be back in form by the weekend. For now he just wants to sit in the bay window seat, with a roaring fire and a glass of port, and sketch the house of his dreams. Insistent owls keep coming, and Draco suspects they\u2019re from his mother. He refuses to let them in.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Thursday night is freezing. He drops his books on the coffee table when he returns from Canterbury and rummages inside the cooling box. He and Astoria had a coffee and a baguette at <em>Nero\u2019s</em>, but that was hours ago. He pulls out some brie and a quince preserve with the handwritten label <em>Jam Today</em> and considers opening a bottle of white, when the doorbell rings.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Blaise, I said I\u2019m\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019s not Blaise.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How the fuck did Temples let you in?\u2019 His receptionist has troll ancestry and never allows anyone in the building without the residents\u2019 say so. \u2018He\u2019s dedicated to keeping riff-raff out.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter says nothing. He doesn\u2019t have to. He probably flashed his name or his scar and got what he desired, like always.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Draco asks, the flesh of his hand biting into the doorknob. He wants to slam the door in his face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter clears his throat and points to the bag he carries. \u2018I er\u2026 brought some Thai.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What fucking audacity. \u2018You\u2019re trying to recreate your stupid Burke traditions with me, after\u2026?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Will and I had <em>Indian</em> Thursdays; I brought Thai. I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u2019 He pauses, closes his eyes briefly. \u2018I\u2019ve sent you owls. Many. Look,\u2019 he continues, his voice more urgent, \u2018I want to talk to you. Can I please come in?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It\u2019d take a stronger man than Draco to say no to Potter, especially when he trains ardent eyes and that stupidly handsome, pink from the cold face on him. Draco wordlessly leads him to the kitchen, but stays at the threshold. Such a bad idea to have Potter in his flat. He\u2019ll touch things and then Draco will have to burn them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter unloads containers on the kitchen island. A mix of fragrances escapes once he opens the lids, lemongrass and ginger and chilli wafting in the room. Once again he brought enough food for a small army.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t know why the owls I sent couldn\u2019t reach you. But it\u2019s better in person, I suppose.\u2019 He glances at Draco, who\u2019s watching him silently. \u2018I want to apologise. I was so out of order that night. I didn\u2019t mean any of it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018But you said it.\u2019 Draco\u2019s pleased at how cold his voice sounds.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I did say it, and I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know <em>why</em> I said it, I don\u2019t actually <em>believe</em>\u2014 I felt so angry when you\u2014\u2019 He takes a deep breath and a step closer to Draco. \u2018I can\u2019t explain why. I can only apologise. I hope you forgive me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco doesn\u2019t know what to say. They stand frozen for a moment as if someone\u2019s painting them, Harry with a hand on the counter, Draco leaning in the doorframe, arms crossed. Something untangles inside Draco. There\u2019s no question about forgiveness \u2014 Draco was forgiven for so much worse, by Granger, by Weasley, by everyone. Besides, the admission that his little tryst provoked anger in Potter and not contempt lodges in the back of his mind, a pebble inside a shoe.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He moves into the kitchen, swishing his wand to Summon plates. \u2018Apology accepted. Pureblood norms suggest we dine in the formal dining room, but how about we get a tray in front of the TV?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sounds perfect,\u2019 Potter smiles, looking relieved \u2014 at the TV suggestion or the forgiveness Draco isn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They pile the containers on an enormous tray (\u2018didn\u2019t know what you liked so I got a bit of everything\u2019) that floats ahead of them into the living room. Potter lingers there, takes the space in, and Draco watches him, palms sweaty. Draco poured everything he is into this flat and it scares him, not knowing what Potter might notice. The eye tends to fall first on the understated opulence, the Italian white leather sofas and the crystal ashtray, filled to the brim with cigarette butts, next to an empty bottle of wine. Or, he hopes, he <em>desperately </em>hopes, Potter is the kind of person who\u2019ll see how the cream colour scheme of the walls matches the antique herringbone tiles on the fireplace, and how Draco attempted to bring the nature he grew up with in his city space: a moss-green rug, a cashmere throw in heather, a bold, teal ceiling from which hangs a white sculpted lamp. The artwork on the walls is his: sketches of Hogwarts and the Manor in black pencil, and there are several thriving gardenias by the windows \u2014 his mother\u2019s favourite flower \u2014 lending their sweet fragrance to the room.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter smiles wistfully. \u2018You\u2019ve got a lovely home,\u2019 is all he says. Draco is about to enquire for more when he notices his university textbooks on the coffee table. Potter follows his gaze, but Draco has already sent them hurtling into his bedroom. He lowers his wand with an exhale, not ready to share that part of him yet; the habit of keeping things close to the chest is a hard one to beat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter gives him an apologetic look. \u2018I wasn\u2019t going to pry.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He looks sincere, shy and un<em>fucking</em>real, standing there in his red hoodie like a fire burning in the middle of Draco\u2019s carpet, and Draco regrets everything about tonight. He regrets opening the door, he regrets suggesting this deal, he regrets even going to Hogwarts. All his life is a series of regrets, because he can\u2019t bear the thought that Potter will leave his flat; not now when he looks so good in it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Swallowing, he points to a door in the corner, taking the levitating tray in his hands. \u2018The den is through there.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Cool!\u2019 Potter pronounces when he enters the compact, grey and blue room, charmingly cluttered compared to the airy, open space of Draco\u2019s living room. \u00a0A tingling at the entrance warns that magic is restricted.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Glad my d\u00e9cor has the approval of someone who\u2019s wearing <em>those</em> shoes.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter has been checking the assortment of Hogwarts textbooks, treatises on alchemy and Muggle novels on the bookcase, but turns at Draco\u2019s words. \u2018Do my shoes offend you?\u2019 He unlaces the scruffy trainers and takes them off. \u2018Better?\u2019 he asks, his smile teasing and challenging at the same time. He insists on not taking Draco\u2019s insults seriously, which irks Draco. He likes to rile Potter.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But he also likes the smiles.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They sit on the enormous grey sofa. Draco dims the lights to comfortable (not<em> romantic</em>, he tells his mind, which snorts in response), flicks the TV on and places the tray between them \u2014 a barrier or a bridge.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019d like to turn a room in Grimmauld Place magic-proof,\u2019 Potter muses, mixing a little of each curry on his plate. \u2018I miss TV, especially when I\u2019m hungover.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Pretty sure that\u2019s what TV was invented for,\u2019 Draco agrees. He spoons some som tum on his plate. \u2018So, what\u2019s with all this? Is this how you normally apologise?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter shrugs. \u2018I find people don\u2019t slam the door in your face when you show up with food.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018This a regular occurrence with you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sometimes I show up with flowers,\u2019 Potter says. \u2018Will and I \u2026 well, we had a lot of rows,\u2019 Potter replies, moving the conversation to Draco\u2019s favourite topic: William sodding Burke.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How did Burke apologise?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter chews for a long moment, a cloud darkening his face.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Ah</em>. \u2018How often did you fuck up then, Potter?\u2019 Draco asks, trying to keep his tone teasing and not hint at the indignation that sweeps over him at the suggestion that Burke thought himself too good to apologise to Potter.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018A lot, apparently. He\u2019s right, though \u2014 I handled certain things badly. I\u2019m not used to being part of a \u2026 team. I tend to do things on my own.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And he wanted to go couples grocery shopping? How utterly <em>dull</em>.\u2019 Draco aims for teasing, he wants to lighten the mood and dispel the cloud on Potter\u2019s face, but his valiant effort fails.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Last February he begged me to go to his uncle\u2019s Imbolc ball. I\u2019m not big on pureblood balls\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Too stiff and boring, full of politely cruel remarks and serpentine conversations that seem to make no sense until a week later you find out you somehow agreed to invest in someone\u2019s harebrained scheme, marry someone\u2019s daughter or support someone\u2019s father\u2019s political campaign?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This attempt wasn\u2019t fruitless: Potter laughs. \u2018That\u2019s precisely <em>it</em>.\u2019 He casts a look of intrigue to Draco. \u2018If you don\u2019t like them, why do you go?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I turn down loads of invitations, if you must know. Malfoys still top any guest list worth its salt. The amount of gold one has is proportionate to people\u2019s desire to ignore some rather unsavoury aspects of one\u2019s past. And there are certain obligations to be fulfilled, anniversaries and betrothals and the like. Besides, that\u2019s my turf. Pureblood snobbery is in my blood, you must have noticed.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He\u2019s sarcastic, but Potter gives him a smile. \u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say that\u2019s completely true, now.\u2019 He gazes into Draco\u2019s eyes, which is very unfortunate for Draco\u2019s heart and lungs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dragging his eyes from Potter\u2019s so he can give his organs a fighting chance, Draco forks some rice and says, \u2018Well, what\u2019s the story with the Imbolc ball? Do tell.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter settles back, the cloud back on his face. \u2018That was our first major row. I agreed to go to the ball, bought new dress robes, everything. I wanted to make an effort. But the day before, this hostage situation came up in Inverness and I spent three straight days there. I completely forgot about it. I returned \u2014 exhausted, sleepless, having failed to save four people \u2014 and the whole argument escalated pretty quickly.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco wonders if he could get away with murdering Burke. \u2018He pounced when you had just come back from a harrowing case?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Apparently, dishing out any negativity towards Burke is a no-no. Potter hurries to justify his ex and adds, \u2018The make-up sex was brilliant, though. The best ever probably.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco pretends he doesn\u2019t feel what his insides are doing. He really is a phenomenal actor, if he can sit there calmly and listen to all this with his own ears. He\u2019d spent the last year and a half pretending Burke and Potter were celibate and possibly Mormons.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He attempts to change the subject, but apparently Potter thinks he\u2019s in the confessional. \u2018I told him I was sorry and he said, <em>it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m disappointed, but it\u2019s fine</em>. And once I heard the \u2018but\u2019, I couldn\u2019t unhear it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What do you mean?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018He\u2019d say things like, <em>I like going to the Muggle pub, </em>and I\u2019d also hear: but it\u2019s not our world; <em>I enjoy spending time with Ron and Hermione </em>(but not too much); <em>Of course I want you to catch the bad guys</em> (but I wish you\u2019d spend more time at home).\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So why the <em>fuck</em> are you still pining?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter shifts into a defensive pose. \u2018It wasn\u2019t all bad, Draco, even you must realise that. I liked cooking with him and walking the dog together; he\u2019d leave me notes on the fridge: \u201cWe need milk. I love you, W\u201d and he held me and soothed me when\u2014 you know, nightmares and stuff. You\u2019ve no idea how supportive he was in that respect. Will <em>cares</em>. He wants to help people. I admire that.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">If Draco ever entertains the stupid idea that Potter might be interested in him, he\u2019ll remind himself of this speech. Draco cares \u2014 for his own. He\u2019d give his life (and he almost did) for his parents. He\u2019d do anything for Astoria and Pansy and Blaise and he\u2019s the one paying for Greg\u2019s rehab even if nobody else knows. He cares for <em>his</em> people. But the nobility of spirit that Potter admires, that irrepressible need to save everyone everywhere, a one hundred per cent Potter trademark, is not a Draco trait.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He feels Potter\u2019s eyes on him, but ignores it. He wants him to go and also to never leave. Potter\u2019s always had the knack of making him feel pulled into two directions, threatening to tear Draco apart.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I er\u2026 also brought something else.\u2019 Potter balances his plate on his knees and pulls a package from his pocket. Draco takes it from his proffered hand, unwraps it and stares at a small, silver-backed mirror. He knows what these things are. He\u2019s not sure he can speak.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s a communication mirror,\u2019 Potter explains when the silence stretches for too long. \u2018I have its twin and we can talk to each other through this in magical spaces. Like the Muggle mobiles. Mobile phones are phones you can take anywhere.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I know what they are,\u2019 Draco says, his voice low, and points at the sleek black Nokia on the shelf. He caresses the smooth cold surface of the mirror. He can\u2019t fathom why Potter would want to talk to him regularly. \u2018Thank you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Next time I won\u2019t have to send owl after owl,\u2019 Potter says. \u2018Although we could communicate with Patronus\u2026\u2019 He glances at Draco, who chews his bite of rice and Massaman thoroughly before replying that he never managed to achieve anything more than an incorporeal Patronus. Potter seems amused.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Now I can reach you whenever I need you,\u2019 he adds, slanting a sideways look at Draco.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s ears are ringing. His heart is thumping at the words of Potter <em>needing</em> him\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018\u2014like you did, at the bistro.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Ah. Draco shakes his head at how foolish he\u2019s being. His voice is cold as he tosses the mirror on the table and says, \u2018Of course. You might require my fake boyfriend services and I might be in need of yours. Good thinking. Who knows when my mother will surprise me with a suitor again.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter looks at his plate. He spears a baby carrot. \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco feels something has trickled through his fingers, but he can\u2019t tell what, but then Potter launches into a tirade about the upcoming Quidditch match and the Aurors\u2019 chances \u2014 miniscule \u2014 and conversation moves to safe topics.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An hour and a half later, half of the dishes are empty and the tray has relocated on the floor. Draco leans back on the sofa, his stomach full, relishing the contentment that good food brings. Potter\u2019s similarly sprawled beside him, feet on the sofa, face soft with relaxation. They watch one soap opera after another, all named after locations, and Potter laughs at the rude things Draco has to say about the acting and storylines. It sends little thrills down Draco\u2019s spine every time. They amuse themselves by imagining a soap called <em>Hogwarts</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018\u2014and then, McGonagall will have an evil twin who\u2019ll try to take over the school\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Whom our McGonagall will defeat until \u2014 until she has an accident and needs a brain transplant so she gets her twin sister\u2019s <em>brain</em>, who\u2019s dying anyway from a mysterious illness, and then becomes <em>really </em>evil\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, no, she has a split personality, so she says one thing to Sprout and something else to Flitwick and they fight all the time.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You mean Flitwick who has a secret lover?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018A secret, <em>centaur </em>lover.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Who turns out to be Slughorn\u2019s real father come back from the dead!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They laugh at the absurdity, deep belly laughs, while Muggle news \u2014 always dire \u2014 and commercials \u2014 impossibly happy \u2014 play on the screen. Sometime in the evening, snow starts falling outside, soft and light, barely visible, not enough to settle. Draco has provided some craft beers that Potter made fun of, but drank nonetheless. Potter rests his head back on the sofa, eyes closed. Draco has no idea how they\u2019d moved this close to each other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you wish you were back at school?\u2019 Potter asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yes,\u2019 Draco says. \u2018And no.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter remains with eyes closed. His left hand lies between them, and Draco stares at it, wanting to trace the knuckles with a finger. He allows his own hand to rest next to Potter\u2019s, but is careful not to touch it. \u2018You?\u2019 he asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The same. Yes. And no.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A Christmas jingle drifts from the TV. Draco should put up the Christmas decorations one of these days. He breathes slowly and watches Potter. Perhaps he\u2019ll fall asleep and have to spend the night. Draco has a guest room.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I miss the structure of it, I reckon,\u2019 Potter whispers, barely audible. His thumb moves imperceptibly, touches Draco\u2019s palm. Draco doesn\u2019t move his hand away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Your work gives structure to your day,\u2019 Draco says. He\u2019s staring at Potter\u2019s fingers: not as long as Draco\u2019s, bony knuckles, a smudge of ink on the index. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An almost unconscious movement by Potter \u2014 who does seem to be falling asleep \u2014 brings half his hand on top of Draco\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t draw it back and Draco doesn\u2019t, either. He takes deep breaths, as quietly as he can, so Potter won\u2019t realise that Draco is slowly dying next to him. He wants to stroke Potter\u2019s skin. Just a little.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He does. He moves his index almost absent-mindedly and strokes a tiny part of one of Potter\u2019s fingers. His heart is thundering. Potter doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed it. They\u2019ve held hands before, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but this feels different; alone, in Draco\u2019s flat, just the two of them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Work helps a lot,\u2019 Potter says, and Draco tries to remember what they\u2019re talking about. \u2018I enjoy it, I\u2019m good at it\u2026\u2019 Potter continues. \u2018Outside of work\u2014 There are so many possibilities, so many things I can be and do, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being or doing any of those things, and if I should. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m failing at living.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter moves a finger against Draco\u2019s and Draco\u2019s heart stutters. He\u2019s well on the way to a heart attack, simply from Potter\u2019s, accidental probably, tiny finger movements.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He should say something to Potter, something comforting and clever, something impressive, but his brain isn\u2019t cooperating. He tells himself it\u2019s the drowsiness of a heavy dinner and beer. He closes his eyes, every sense focused on his hand, and strokes Potter\u2019s finger again. A second later, Potter strokes back, ever so slightly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When he opens his eyes, Potter\u2019s looking at him. His eyes gleam in the soft light of the table lamp, and he\u2019s looking at Draco as if he\u2019s someone new and strange to him. The snow keeps falling and Draco is gathering the courage to link his fingers with Potter\u2019s and to hell with\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A thump echoes from the living room. \u2018Draco!\u2019 calls a high, clear voice. \u2018Where <em>are </em>you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The moment shatters. Draco heads to the living room, intending to murder his friend. The room\u2019s dark, lit only by the streetlamp and the street\u2019s Christmas lights, and she stands in front of the fireplace. With a wave of Draco\u2019s wand, the lights come on, just as someone else tumbles through the Floo after Pansy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Darling!\u2019 Pansy exclaims and moves to greet him, but stops short when she spots Potter, coming from the den. \u2018Well, well, <em>well</em>. Hello, Potter. Sorry for the intrusion, Draco; I had no idea you were <em>entertaining</em>.\u2019 She leers at Draco, just as the fireplace spews more people out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re all there, his friends: Pansy in diamonds, holding Eurig\u2019s arm, Blaise in a purple pinstripe suit, Daphne with a bottle of champagne in each hand, Duncan in a fedora, even Astoria in a tuxedo jacket over an impossibly short black dress. They\u2019re noisy and slightly tipsy, dizzyingly glamorous, like they jumped from the pages of a glossy magazine. They all eye Potter with curiosity and give Draco leers \u2014 except Astoria and Blaise, who frown. Eurig lights a cigar, Blaise puts some music on, Astoria apologises for bringing them all in without checking if Draco had company, and Pansy holds his hands and says, \u2018We\u2019re going clubbing in Luxemburg! There\u2019s a new club with Veela dancers and satyrs for serving boys. Blaise bought a European Portkey, leaving in an hour. Can you come?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco knows of the club they mean; he heard talk of it in one of the balls he attended. The entrance fee costs as much as a month\u2019s rent in Chelsea. He\u2019d be sorely tempted if it wasn\u2019t for his desire to lock himself and Potter in his flat and never leave. Pansy\u2019s keen, smoky eyes stray to Potter. \u2018You could come, too,\u2019 she tells him. \u2018Lots of space on the portkey. Unless you two want to stay alone\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Potter dismisses the invitation. \u2018No, that\u2019s fine. I was going to go anyway. Early shift tomorrow. Er\u2026 enjoy your night, guys. Bye, Draco.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco feels everyone\u2019s eyes on them and obviously Potter does too, because he leans in and kisses Draco softly on the cheek. \u2018Have fun,\u2019 he whispers in his ear, his hands on Draco\u2019s waist. The next moment, he waves goodbye, finds his coat, and eschews the Floo for Apparition down the street.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco doesn\u2019t know what his face is doing, but judging by Astoria\u2019s look, it isn\u2019t good. He takes a deep breath, pushes everything Potterish deep down, and turns to his chattering friends. \u2018An <em>hour </em>for the portkey? No time to lose, people. Blaise, pick a shirt for me; Astoria, fix my hair; and Daphne, pass me that bottle of Cristal, I want to get sloshed tonight.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Luxembourg club is set up as a boudoir of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, all deep reds and gilded mirrors. Astoria immediately abandons them to talk to the Chaser of the Lux Vixens, who also happens to be present: Ms Weasley herself. Draco chuckles when he realises whose idea it <em>really </em>was to come here tonight, even though he initially thought it was a reconnaissance mission for Blaise. Holding her waist, Draco whispers in Astoria\u2019s ear, \u2018You\u2019re such a Slytherin\u2019, and she gives him a wicked grin before she finds Weasley and chats with her, lightly touching her wrist. Well, good for her. Astoria deserves all the happiness in the world, especially after the reaction of her parents to her coming out. Draco can\u2019t help but feel a twinge of reluctant gratitude that his parents \u2014 unhappy as they were at the news of no future Malfoy heirs \u2014 quickly accepted him, even going as far as setting him up with that Todd.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He sips his Manhattan and observes the satyrs, brought to Lux City by one of the Med countries, and exuding a wild magic, a vibrating energy that contributes to the hedonistic, decadent ambiance. Blaise spends most of his night conversing with a satyr in order to see how he can hire one for his club. \u00a0Pansy and Eurig exhibit frankly obscene behaviour, snogging rampantly like the newlyweds they are, and Draco wants to smack them upside the head. In fact, with Astoria and Blaise busy with love and business affairs, he is left alone with the couples. Gratitude for Daphne\u2019s prim and proper pureblood poise vanishes when he sees Duncan slip his hand under her skirt.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco finds refuge on the dancefloor, dancing to music different to the deep house tunes he\u2019s used to back home. The men differ, too: more polished, smoother and sexier, in a sleek sort of way. Draco can\u2019t take his mind off a scruffy sort of someone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The thought he entertained last week, that hanging out with Potter would make him less desirable, was ludicrous at best. Draco can\u2019t imagine having to go back to staring at Potter from a distance. The idea that Potter might get back with his ex, or fall for someone new makes Draco ache so much that he feels physically sick. He drinks some more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He hears from Potter the next night. Draco\u2019s putting up fairy lights around the windows when a voice yells his name in the empty living room. He jumps out of his skin and swears profusely at Potter, whose green eyes meet his in the mirror.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You can Silence the volume,\u2019 Potter says when he stops laughing, and teaches him how to do it. But Draco doesn\u2019t Silence it. He takes the mirror everywhere and sleeps with it on his bedside table. Potter calls him the next night, too. He\u2019s busy with a case, something about a series of home invasions with a high body count. He sounds exhausted.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Tell me about the club,\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I might have swung from the chandelier at some point in the night,\u2019 Draco replies truthfully \u2014 he was assured that he didn\u2019t imagine it, but he\u2019s yet to see photographic evidence \u2014 and Potter bursts in a surprised, delighted laugh. Draco tells him about the topless satyrs in bow ties and the Veela women in cages in silver bikinis, and Potter seems to like listening to Draco\u2019s stories. He asks questions and laughs at all of Draco\u2019s jokes and falls asleep first.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco doesn\u2019t sleep for a long time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">His reflection gives him the thumbs up. Harry straightens his cuffs and smoothes his lapels one last time, but despite the nerves, he\u2019s pleased with his purchase. Kreacher even said Harry reminded him of Regulus, \u2018if Regulus were to lower himself to wear Muggle clothing\u2019, which is, nonetheless, the highest praise Kreacher has bestowed on him. It gives Harry some confidence about tonight. Malfoy\u2019s anxiety about the Nithercott soiree is rubbing off on him. Malfoy had spent their dinner at the <em>Young Mandrake</em> yesterday tapping his fingers on the tablecloth, smoking like a fiend and schooling Harry about his likes or dislikes in case his mother questions him. Harry now knows that Malfoy had a stuffed dragon as a child that he beheaded in a fit of anger; that he\u2019s allergic to kiwi; that he takes his tea with one sugar and a splash of milk; that when he has bad dreams, he needs to have his hair stroked to fall back to sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry doesn\u2019t want to admit how long he\u2019s fixated on that last piece of information.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">What he\u2019ll admit to himself is that the last couple of weeks have taken his mind off Will a little. Seeing yet another picture of him and Joaquin in the <em>Prophet</em> (\u201cthe happy couple shopping for groceries together,\u201d read the caption) doesn\u2019t hurt as much as it did before. Perhaps he has been desensitized to it; the shock of seeing Will with someone else isn\u2019t new anymore and, therefore, not as hurtful.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps talking about it has made a difference. Harry didn\u2019t have to explain much to Hermione, Ron and Ginny, mainly because they had lived through the death throes of that relationship with him. Putting into words the details that Malfoy, unlike his friends, isn\u2019t aware of makes Harry recall things, like the fact that arguments were always Harry\u2019s fault, or how often he and Will were apart due to their schedules. Things he\u2019d pushed aside during the first two months of his break-up when the Will-Harry Best Hits were all that played in his mind: gilded memories of a bliss that he felt he\u2019d let slip through his fingers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">One of the things that had bothered Will was Malfoy. Will had disliked him on sight, much like Harry had all those years ago, which Harry took as another thing they had in common. \u2018He\u2019s everything I despise, all money and style and no substance,\u2019 Will had said, and Harry had agreed because that\u2019s all he saw then, too.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Harry griped that Malfoy seemed to dislike him, only him out of everyone, Will would ask why he cared. Sometimes Harry snapped back, <em>I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just saying</em>, and Will would say, <em>why do you let him get under your skin</em>, and Harry would say, <em>you have no idea of what Malfoy has been like to me for years and years, what we went through during the war</em>, and Will would huff loudly, <strong><em>enough</em></strong><em> with the war, it\u2019s all about the war</em>, and Harry would fume, <em>how can you say that, when you know\u2014 you know what I\u2014</em> and then he\u2019d storm out and slam the door behind him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fights about Malfoy turned into fights about the war, and fights about the war never ended in sex.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The doorbell rings and Harry glances one last time at the mirror. The gentle sheen of the jacket (<em>classy</em>, the assistant assured him) contrasts smartly with the velvet lapels. The assistant helped him choose the right tie and a silk kerchief. Harry might have spent more money than he\u2019d ever spent on a suit \u2014 or a couch \u2014 but he\u2019s not going to be shown up by Malfoy this time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The bell rings more insistently. Harry takes the stairs two at a time, rubs his palms on his trousers, and yanks the door open.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s on his doorstep, lighting a cigarette, hands cupped around the flame. He glances up and smiles, smoke curling out of his lips. \u2018Hey.\u2019 He\u2019s in a teal suit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A fucking <em>teal</em> suit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hey,\u2019 is all that Harry can say. Malfoy looks absolutely <em>unreal,</em> a mirage in the burnished street light, the teal shade bringing out the best in his skin tone. He made his look edgier by messing up his hair and adding a hint of eyeliner and a couple of silver rings: he\u2019s absolutely striking. Harry feels a dazed smile on his face and a rush of blood that he\u2019s careful not to examine too closely. Malfoy steps closer, runs a long finger on Harry\u2019s jacket and murmurs, \u2018Not bad.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He smells nice, that cedar-lime fragrance of his that shouldn\u2019t be hypnotising; but it is. Harry swallows. \u2018Shall we?\u2019 He offers his arm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy seems fazed by the reminder of where they\u2019re headed, but recovers instantly. \u2018Into the fray we go,\u2019 he says cheerfully, takes Harry\u2019s arm, and they Disapparate to Mrs Nithercott\u2019s Lake District house, an Elizabethan style mansion according to Malfoy, who peers at the gables, while Harry rings the bell.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mrs Nithercott is a short, chubby woman with several strings of pearls around her neck, inexpertly pairing her cyan robes with a Muggle bomber jacket. Harry has seen a lot of these combinations now that <em>Muggle</em> is the flavour of the day and they never stop being amusing. She smiles broadly at Harry, \u2018pleased to make your acquaintance\u2019; a smile which transforms into a scowl when she notices Malfoy on her doorstep.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018She invited me once, three years ago,\u2019 Malfoy murmurs in his ear as they follow her through to the living room. \u2018Caught me smoking a doobie with her nieces in the master bedroom.\u2019 Malfoy shrugs. \u2018No idea why she blamed me. It was their weed.\u2019 He gives Harry one of his crooked smiles. \u2018Perhaps she thought I had a mind to deflower them. She needn\u2019t have worried. Obviously.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry turns to him. \u2018Is this the first time you\u2019ve attended one of these parties with a man?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy dismisses it. \u2018Pfft. The paparazzi have already outed me, Potter, if you might recall from today\u2019s rather lurid headline.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You call me Harry in front of others,\u2019 Harry says, as their host ushers them into a well-appointed drawing room with a huge Christmas tree in one corner.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018In front of others I\u2019m your boyfriend,\u2019 Malfoy remarks as he bows his head to a witch with a bright yellow pointed hat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You could still call me Harry, though.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy doesn\u2019t reply, but steers Harry gently but firmly towards the bar, greeting the guests in their path, all of whom appear startled to see Harry. Harry\u2019s not sure if the surprise is because he\u2019s with Malfoy, or because he\u2019s attending one of these pureblood gatherings in the first place. The looks and murmurs, the unfamiliar faces and crystal sharp accents, the polite, curious nods shake him, make him feel like an impostor. He\u2019s glad for the armour the expensive suit provides. Relief washes over him when they reach the bar where his drink of choice appears the moment he makes a decision. The spiced ale slips hot through his throat, making him cough a little.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He turns to look at the mingling guests. A harpist is playing in one corner, notes tinkling over the chatter. Some guests are traditionalists, wearing robes and pointy hats; others have made an effort to accessorize with Muggle items; in most cases unsuccessfully, if Harry\u2019s to judge by the pudgy man in black velvet robes and a glitter waistcoat. Malfoy\u2019s parents perch on one of the sofas, elegant and refined, wearing not one thing Muggle. Narcissa\u2019s eyes stray to him and her son, and Malfoy exhales noisily. \u2018I should go say hello.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Want me to come with you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Custom says I should introduce you, but perhaps we can eschew the formalities for now. You know each other.\u2019 A grim smile, and Malfoy weaves through the guests, a teal Muggle vision, attracting attention like a magnet.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry sips his ale and gradually relaxes. Now that he has a moment to take the room in, he realises that the party is a rather intimate affair, nothing like the dozens of guests he\u2019d expected. Robards arrives shortly afterwards, waving jovially at Harry before his wife pulls him towards a cluster of guests. A year after the war Harry had attended a similar event as a favour to Neville, who dreaded going alone to his grandmother\u2019s gatherings. The average age of the guests then had been about forty years higher than here, but the rest was the same: good food, expensive alcohol, some gossip, some politics, some fashion disasters.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s on his way back to him when Mrs Nithercott engages Harry in a conversation, which has Malfoy swerve sharply towards a pair of wizards. Harry bites a smile at his hasty retreat and replies to her enquiries about his Auror career and what he thinks of the harpist. \u2018Brilliant,\u2019 he tells her, glancing at the girl trailing fingers on the harp.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018She\u2019s one of ours,\u2019 she beams, not explaining what that means. Mrs Nithercott\u2019s clever or polite enough to avoid asking intrusive questions about the war. When Harry excuses himself to find Malfoy, he realises he\u2019s also promised a donation to her orphanage that might have been slightly higher than he\u2019d intended.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Oh well.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry circles the room, clutching his glass tightly for support, and wonders how Malfoy does it. How he stands there, relaxed and confident, holding conversations with anyone about anything. How he knows the right thing to say. Harry can tell, though, that his smiles are practised. He knows that much about Malfoy, now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hey,\u2019 he says when he reaches him by the fireplace.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy gives him a real smile, elusive like lightning and just as brief. \u2018Bored to death yet?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No,\u2019 Harry shrugs. \u2018It\u2019s all right. The food is amazing.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The food is always amazing. Don\u2019t tell your elf, though; he\u2019ll be jealous.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Come on!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Always lie through your teeth about the quality of other elves\u2019 cooking. That\u2019s almost a <em>law</em>, Potter.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry laughs. \u2018I had no idea. I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll tell Kreacher the food was awful here.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy nods, his eyes wrinkling in a smile. \u2018He\u2019ll appreciate it, trust me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry sips his ale. \u2018I do.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hm?\u2019 Malfoy\u2019s picked up a photo frame and is tilting it, trying to coax the portrait out.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry gazes at his face. \u2018Nothing.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The harpist has been replaced by a clarinet player, whose instrument conjures pale blue snowflakes with each note, which float around the room. Soon everything\u2019s covered in the fake, glittering snow and the guests laugh as the flakes land on their hair and shoulders. Malfoy asks Harry to dance in the fake snowfall. Harry refuses. Malfoy sulks. They have more drinks. Harry watches Robards, red-cheeked from the elf-wine, talking animatedly about Quidditch to a witch, whose eyes are frantically looking for a way out of the conversation. Malfoy blows kisses to Mrs Nithercott\u2019s nieces and Mrs Nithercott glares at him. It\u2019s fun.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Until Narcissa sidles next to Harry the minute Malfoy is absorbed in a discussion about St Mungo\u2019s funding with someone who Harry thinks <em>may</em> be in the Wizengamot.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Enjoying the evening?\u2019 she asks Harry. Flakes shine through her bright hair.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I am,\u2019 Harry replies, tensing instantly. Malfoy\u2019s behaved like Harry meeting Narcissa would give away their deal, but it turns out that she doesn\u2019t question Harry as to how Malfoy drinks his tea or about his childhood toys, but chats about his work and the Pu.Fo.P\u2019s various projects. Harry relaxes and even laughs when she relates an amusing anecdote from one of the board meetings.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So,\u2019 she says, smile sharp on her face, \u2018I was wondering if you and Draco would like to have luncheon with us next weekend.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cheerfulness vanishes. Just the idea of stepping foot in the Manor covers Harry in cold sweat. That\u2019s one line he won\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t \u2014 cross for his pretend relationship. \u2018Forgive me,\u2019 he tells her, \u2018but I\u2019d rather not visit the place I was held a prisoner.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I understand,\u2019 she concedes after a pause. \u2018Of course, that might be an impediment to your relationship with my son, not willing to visit the home he grew up in.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry thinks he might have made a wrong step somewhere. He feels like he\u2019s dancing on a landmine. \u2018It\u2019s early days,\u2019 he says as diplomatically as he can. \u2018If Draco and I become serious, then it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to deal with.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So this <em>isn\u2019t</em> serious?\u2019 she asks. \u2018Simply a rebound fling for you, perhaps?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Fuck</em>. \u2018No, I er\u2026 I\u2019m very fond of Draco. Not a rebound, no. We\u2019re very close. Really. Awfully in love, if I may be so bold. Head over heels. I er\u2026 make him tea in the mornings. One sugar and a splash of milk.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s vaguely aware he\u2019s fucked up. Narcissa Malfoy smiles as if Harry has confirmed something she suspected. \u2018It was <em>lovely</em> talking to you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A second after she leaves, Malfoy arrives and interrogates him. He runs a hand through his hair, messing it up even more. \u2018Fuck\u2019s sake, Potter, how could you fail so spectacularly? She\u2019ll know it\u2019s a sham.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And the matchmaking will start?\u2019 Harry picks up a blue cheese canap\u00e9 from a passing, floating tray and decides to stuff his face and stop worrying about the weird games Malfoys play.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m talking about the gossip pages. It\u2019ll only take a comment from Mother to the right ear and our charade will end up in the <em>Evening Prophet</em>. \u201cRumour has it all isn\u2019t what it seems with a famous new couple.\u201d Is that what you want? A week before the game against your ex? A week before the gala of the year?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry stiffens and abandons the canap\u00e9. If this is exposed, he won\u2019t be able to face Will ever again and, unfortunately, with the number of injuries he sustains in his work, avoiding him forever isn\u2019t feasible. \u2018What can we do?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s time for drastic measures.\u2019 Malfoy pulls Harry out of the living room and into a corridor of thick carpets, green potted plants and snoring portraits. \u2018Here is fine.\u2019 He drags Harry in a shadowy corner.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018For what?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018We\u2019ll pretend we were caught in a sexual act. The papers will be more interested in printing <em>this</em> kind of gossip instead of whatever my mother decides to tell them.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And so we have to \u2026 fake\u2026?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy blushes. \u2018Is that OK? It only has to <em>appear</em> real, I wouldn\u2019t ask you to\u2014\u2019 Looking at his feet, he says, \u2018Actually, it\u2019s a silly idea\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Someone\u2019s coming,\u2019 Harry interrupts him and pushes him against the wall. Malfoy\u2019s deep blush spreads to his neck. \u2018Never had you for a prude,\u2019 Harry says, his voice low.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m not a prude,\u2019 Malfoy murmurs. \u2018Hm, that was Mrs Glendows, blind as a bat. Not much help\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry doesn\u2019t move back. \u2018Well, someone else will come along now. I think I can hear footsteps.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They stay still, but no one comes. Harry breathes against Malfoy\u2019s jaw. The desire that coils in the pit of his stomach doesn\u2019t surprise him. Somewhere in the back of his mind he\u2019s aware he\u2019s craved this for some time now. He knows he can\u2019t kiss Malfoy, though. It\u2019s the one thing he\u2019s not allowed to do. Hesitant, not sure if he\u2019s overstepping his mark, he lifts his hand and traces Malfoy\u2019s lips with his thumb. Malfoy gasps, his chest rising and falling, his eyes wide. He parts his mouth just a little.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry would like to slip his finger inside Malfoy\u2019s mouth, but he realizes how inappropriate it is. He steps back, but then someone is <em>truly</em> coming and Malfoy cranes his neck and confirms. \u2018Mr Witherbore. Biggest gossip in town.\u2019 He sounds breathless.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How do we do this?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy\u2019s voice is low and raspy and yet he still manages to sneer at Harry. \u2018How do people do this, Potter? Need instructions?\u2019 He unbuttons three buttons of his shirt and unzips his trousers. Holy <em>moly</em> mother of Merlin. Harry forces himself to stare at Malfoy\u2019s eyes, and not the line of golden hair disappearing under the waistband of his Calvins.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Make some noise,\u2019 Malfoy advises.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry moans, a little too loudly, and Malfoy snorts. \u2018Not like that. More\u2026 natural.\u2019 He smirks, a little affectionately.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry retorts, \u2018You do it then, if you\u2019re so good.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy wraps an arm around his waist. Nuzzling Harry\u2019s neck, he lets out a soft moan, which makes Harry\u2019s hair stand on end. Malfoy moves his hips slowly, keeping them an inch away from Harry\u2019s, and gasps in his ear, just like the time Harry overheard him in the club toilets. He runs a hand in Harry\u2019s hair and moans again.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Fuck</em>. Harry\u2019s getting hard. He\u2019s got a fucking boner and Malfoy will taunt him forever if he catches wind of it. The footsteps are coming closer and Harry leans in and smells Malfoy\u2019s neck, his enticing scent emanating from the smooth skin. A kiss on Malfoy\u2019s neck has Malfoy gasp \u2014 this time for real, Harry thinks \u2014 he\u2019s starting to confuse what is real and what isn\u2019t. Lust sweeps through him at the sight of Malfoy\u2019s lean hips grinding slowly, not <em>quite </em>touching Harry, and he slips a hand under Malfoy\u2019s shirt, tracing his back. Back caressing is allowed, he reminds himself. Malfoy\u2019s skin is hot and Harry shivers. He leaves a trail of kisses on Malfoy\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Harry,\u2019 Malfoy murmurs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their clothes rustle as Harry presses closer, chest to chest, but he tries to angle his hips away, desperately hoping Malfoy won\u2019t feel his hard-on. The footsteps have faltered and he knows he needs to give a good show, but all he can do is restrain himself from humping Malfoy for real. His nails leave marks on Malfoy\u2019s back in an effort to rein in his hunger for more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy gives Harry a look that has his heart fluttering. How can he fake such lust? \u2018Harry,\u2019 he breathes again, his face an inch away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fuck it. Fuck all of it. Dizzy with desire, unable to stop himself, Harry presses his pelvis against Malfoy\u2019s thigh and grinds, the feeling of bliss making his knees weak. His fingers bruise Malfoy\u2019s arms, his mouth sucks at his neck. Malfoy\u2019s panting now, and Harry\u2019s thrilled to feel him hard as well. He wants to touch his cock, he\u2019s desperate, but Malfoy hadn\u2019t mentioned cocks in their agreement and Harry\u2019s sure it\u2019s out of the question, but he wants it, he wants it so badly. He bites Malfoy\u2019s neck in frustration and Malfoy gasps, loud and excited, a grin on his face, which turns soft and yearning. He cups Harry\u2019s chin, his eyes flicking on Harry\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Another cough. Insistent this time. Harry becomes aware that a figure is on the edge of his sight, just a couple of feet away from the corner they\u2019re in. Reality rushes in. Harry draws back. Malfoy buttons himself up, his hands shaking, hair falling on his forehead, looking thoroughly debauched. \u2018Mother,\u2019 his voice rings out. \u2018What on earth are you doing here?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry surreptitiously adjusts his trousers to hide his erection. The fact that this was a performance hasn\u2019t wilted it one bit. He\u2019ll need to excuse himself for the nearest loo and take care of it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Mr Witherbore saw fit to tell me that my only son has succumbed to his \u201canimal urges\u201d by the south staircase. Well. I must congratulate you, Draco. It was quite a <em>show</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s unfortunate that Mr Witherbore had to bear witness to my desire for my boyfriend. I do hope he won\u2019t talk to any reporters. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He disappears down the corridor, leaving Harry alone with Narcissa.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I wonder what he has on you,\u2019 she muses, not really expecting a reply. \u2018It must be big.\u2019 Swishing her robes, she returns to the drawing room. Harry ducks inside the nearest toilet and has a furious wank, scandalising the mirror. It chastises him in an elderly aunt\u2019s voice for pleasuring himself during a party and also throws in a few choice comments about the state of his hair.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He returns to the party, hoping he\u2019s imagining the smirks he gets. Malfoy\u2019s lounging in an armchair, dangling a glass of champagne in one hand and biting his thumb in thought, his mouth pouting deliciously and warming up Harry\u2019s groin again. Instructions to his newly interested cock to stand down fail. Pleas ditto. Threats achieve nothing. Glancing desperately around the room, he catches Lucius watching him, which manages to kill his half-erection admirably.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Well, at least Malfoy Senior is good for something.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry dithers choosing a drink at the bar, hesitant to sit by Malfoy. He wonders if Malfoy will taunt him; or if he\u2019s angry. He felt Harry\u2019s erection, but Harry knows Malfoy was hard as well. He catches Malfoy looking at him and then glancing away. Downing his ale, Harry squares his shoulders and approaches his fake date. It was only natural, he tells himself. Any decent bloke would get hard if someone who looked like Malfoy in that fucking teal suit gasped in his ear and gazed at him with such\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He abandons that line of thinking swiftly and flops in an armchair. \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 He points at a group of excited children around a tall woman in green embroidered robes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The orphans are about to torture us with Christmas carols,\u2019 Malfoy tells Harry without looking at him. \u2018Wanna scram?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No, I want to listen to them.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Orphan solidarity?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s temper flares. Everything about Malfoy is complicated, confusing, fucking exasperating. \u2018Sometimes you\u2019re such a dickhead.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs, an eyebrow raised in disdain.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry wants to punch him when he\u2019s being like that. He wants to lay his hands on him and\u2014 Vexation and lust course through his veins, blending in a potent, heady emotion that, combined with the alcohol, makes him a little dizzy. Trying to relax, he grabs a canap\u00e9 without even checking what it is and bites into it. Brie with pear preserve. Ron would have loved it.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The choir comprises of twenty-odd children of various ages, including the harpist and the clarinet player. Three little ones go first, singing the Cherry-Tree Carol, muddling through the lyrics, and then they run around the guests\u2019 legs while the older ones continue.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A small girl flashes past like a hurricane, and pauses, drawn by the colour of Malfoy\u2019s suit. After the fourth time she\u2019s circled them, she reaches tentatively to touch the jacket Malfoy has on the back of his seat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you like the colour?\u2019 he asks. When she nods, he wraps it around her. \u2018Let\u2019s see if it suits you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She giggles. \u2018It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got the sky around me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry leans back and watches Malfoy grinning at the girl. He\u2019s fascinating; the way he can go from nasty to affectionate in the same breath. Malfoy gives her a mischievous look. \u2018How about I transfigure it to \u2026 would you like a dress or a cloak?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She ponders, hand on her chin and face frowning. \u2018A cloak please.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Let\u2019s do it then.\u2019 Malfoy pulls his wand out of his pocket and mutters the incantation. The jacket transforms into a thick teal cloak with a silver clasp.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You did it!\u2019 She swirls around herself, a bright blue blur, and the cloak billows around her.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She stops, stumbles, but Malfoy catches her with an arm around her shoulders. \u2018It\u2019s yours now.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018But won\u2019t you be cold?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Nah. I can Apparate home, just like that,\u2019 he clicks his fingers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Thank you!\u2019 She runs to the tall woman in green and points at them. Malfoy sits back and resumes listening to the carols.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That was nice,\u2019 Harry breaks the silence.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs. \u2018It was nothing. A simple spell.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t <em>nothing</em>. Not many people would have done it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs again. \u2018Just a jacket, Potter, no big deal. I have many.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry pretends to listen to the carols, but he can\u2019t help watching Malfoy, who smokes and applauds at the end of the songs and sometimes glances at Harry. Harry doesn\u2019t know how to put into words the messy knot of thoughts and feelings in his mind; he figures he might try and leans forward, when the girl returns. Completely taken with Malfoy, she decides to tell him about the carol she learned and her first ride on a broomstick. Harry stands. He chuckles at Malfoy\u2019s wide-eyed, wordless plea for Harry to stay and help him with this little human. \u2018She\u2019s your fan. You deal with her.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He ambles around the room, half-listening to the carols, and ends by the window where the tall woman in green stands. The view of the lake is magnificent. Mrs Nithercott has enchanted several orbs of light to float over her gardens like small moons, illuminating the manicured lawn.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The woman in green is Elaine, the orphanage\u2019s matron. \u2018Lily Wang,\u2019 she says, glancing at the girl climbing over Malfoy. \u2018She\u2019s a <em>darling</em>. A bit of a troublemaker, but always follows orders when you explain things to her. Smart for her age. Four,\u2019 she answers Harry\u2019s unspoken question. \u2018Half-blood. Not an orphan as such, but her mother is in St Mungo\u2019s with irreversible mental damage.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Are the other kids war orphans?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She sighs. \u2018War orphans. What does that mean? Children that lost their parents <em>during</em> the war? We have eleven out of the twenty-three. But the rest\u2026 Those two over there,\u2019 she points at two small, dark kids. \u2018Their father assisted the Death Eaters. Not a purist, never hurt anyone himself, just\u2014 turned a blind eye. Three years ago he committed suicide, couldn\u2019t bear the guilt when all the crimes came to light. When that mass grave was unearthed\u2026 Terrible business. Pearl over there \u2014 the redhead, yes \u2014 had parents who sustained curse wounds during the war. Both succumbed a year ago. Are these kids <em>not</em> war orphans?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry feels a cold hand squeeze his chest, a feeling that rears its head every so often. The war is a dark ivy, its roots and branches tight around every aspect of their lives. Those who weren\u2019t here during the war can\u2019t detect its legacy. But it\u2019s there, pulsing under the glorious fa\u00e7ade of peace.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Does the war ever end?\u2019 he asks Elaine, his voice low.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She has kind eyes. \u2018Eventually it will. For most of us. Maybe not for you. Not for the Malfoys. It doesn\u2019t matter. We all soldier on, as best we can. But there\u2019s hope. Love can help us figure out how to fix things after the war,\u2019 she says, reminding him of Dumbledore. \u2018And maybe,\u2019 she nods towards Malfoy, who\u2019s coming their way, \u2018find some happiness while we\u2019re at it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy reaches them with a sleeping Lily on his chest, looking positively alarmed. \u2018She asked me for a story. I told her the Babbity Rabbity and she fell asleep in my arms.\u2019 He gives a stunned look at the dark head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019ll take her.\u2019 Elaine pulls the girl to her. \u2018And thank you for the very generous donation, Mr Malfoy.\u2019 She gives a warm smile to Harry. \u2018I enjoyed talking to you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When they\u2019re alone, Harry looks at Malfoy, who\u2019s ironing the wrinkles of his shirt with his wand. Seeing him with Lily in his arms stirred something inside Harry. If there\u2019s one thing he\u2019s certain about, it\u2019s this: Harry wants kids. It was one of the things he loved about Will: he was fabulous around children; Teddy adored him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You made a donation?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That\u2019s what we Malfoys do, Potter. Throw gold around. That\u2019s what people like us for.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t like you only for that,\u2019 Harry murmurs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A pause. Malfoy stares outside the window, his voice low when he speaks. \u2018Why do you say things like that?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Why not? It\u2019s true,\u2019 Harry replies, feeling a little shaky. He\u2019s unused to socializing with people who remind him of the best and the worst of their world. He\u2019s unused to being around a person who elicits so many tangled emotions in him. Restless energy tingles at his fingertips.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy turns and examines his face. \u2018Are you all right? Do you want to leave?\u2019 He sounds concerned.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry rubs his temples. \u2018No, I\u2019m fine. I want\u2014 I don\u2019t know.\u2019 He knows what he wants, but he can\u2019t say it. He <em>doesn\u2019t</em> want to return to Grimmauld Place with this tension running through his blood \u2014 or at least not alone. But he can\u2019t ask Malfoy back to his for a nightcap. He\u2019ll probably have more glamorous places to be, anyway.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy gives him an impish smile, not quite successfully. There\u2019s a hint of uncertainty under the wickedness as if he can\u2019t quite be himself around Harry either. \u2018Want to explore the house? I\u2019ve a joint if you want it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sure, and then I\u2019ll arrest myself. I\u2019d rather not know of the drugs you carry.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This time Malfoy\u2019s smile is truly sly as they discreetly leave the room. \u2018Wizarding law only prohibits potions and powdered shrivelfig, not Muggle drugs. A small oversight of our illustrious lawmakers.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And how very convenient for you,\u2019 Harry remarks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For some time they roam dark living rooms, studies and parlours. The music drifts behind them as they delve deeper in the mansion; an echo that, progressively, fades away.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What did Mrs Nithercott tell you to upset you?\u2019 Malfoy asks as he opens a door. \u2018Ah, here we are.\u2019 He heads towards a large piano, bathed in the silver light from the enchanted orbs in the garden.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I wasn\u2019t talking to Mrs Nithercott, I was talking to Elaine.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Who <em>is</em> Mrs Nithercott.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Is she? Who\u2019s the woman who came to the door?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Mrs Nithercott.\u2019 Malfoy grins; he\u2019s enjoying this. He sits at the piano bench and lifts the polished fall board. \u2018Figured it out yet?\u2019 He presses a few keys softly.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry sits beside him. \u2018They\u2019re married.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy nods. \u2018Same sex marriages are uncommon, but they do exist. Elaine\u2019s the one with the money, but she took Portia\u2019s surname.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So if we were to get married, you might take my name?\u2019 Harry teases and instantly freezes, realising what he said. Malfoy\u2019s expression is pure shock and Harry feels his cheeks burning. \u2018So, er\u2026 do you play?\u2019 he asks quickly, ramming a few keys and grimacing at the jarring noise. God, everything about Malfoy\u2019s strumming his nerves tight and he can\u2019t think straight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018A little,\u2019 Malfoy replies, blinking fast. \u2018I\u2019m not that good.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Go on. Play something.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eyes intent on the keys, Malfoy positions his hands. \u2018Let\u2019s start with something easy. If I can remember it.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The melody fills the room and allows Harry\u2019s breathing to return to normal. Malfoy plays with poise and some detachment, an unlit cigarette hanging on his lip, but gradually he relaxes into it. He launches into a faster melody, a tempo that reverberates in the empty room, and then \u2014 taking the cigarette off his mouth \u2014 he plays a slow, aching sequence, his fingers soft on the keys. It\u2019s not perfect, some parts are clumsy, but Harry can\u2019t take his eyes off him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">These two weeks it\u2019s as if Harry has been granted a peek behind the curtain. Malfoy\u2019s dazzling in every sense of the word, glamorous <em>and </em>blinding, but there\u2019s something awfully quiet and soft about him when his barriers are down. It intrigues Harry. He wants to take a closer look at the softness.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When Malfoy stops, his eyes meet Harry\u2019s. Neither says anything for a long moment.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s knee is pressing against Malfoy\u2019s. He coughs. \u2018Can you teach me?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sure. Place your hand like this.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry follows his example and Malfoy lays his hand over Harry\u2019s. \u2018Relax. Let me.\u2019 He presses Harry\u2019s fingers in turns producing a short tune like a lullaby. His hand is warm over Harry\u2019s and Harry feels overwhelmed with a profound, sweet ache. He twists his hand slowly, the melody fading, and traces his fingertips over Malfoy\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy stills, except for his hand: it caresses Harry\u2019s, fingers on fingers as if they\u2019re comparing them. Harry keeps looking at the slow dance of their hands, fingertips trailing soft skin, and when Harry lifts his eyes, he sees Malfoy staring at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s chest rises and falls, trying to find a way out of those eyes. Malfoy is close, so very close. Harry leans in an inch, his pulse racing. Malfoy shifts closer so that Harry smells the champagne on his breath. His lips part, soft and full, and Harry\u2019s tongue licks his own, his mouth suddenly dry. Lifting his other hand, he traces Malfoy\u2019s cheek, soft under his fingers and warm, and Malfoy lets out a small sigh. Harry\u2019s restraint is hanging by a thread. \u2018I won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want me to do,\u2019 he whispers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018This is what\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Someone clears their throat by the door, startling them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Mother. I didn\u2019t see you there,\u2019 Malfoy says in a strangled voice.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco, Mrs Nithercott\u2019s looking for you. She\u2019d like to formally thank you for your contribution,\u2019 Narcissa Malfoy says, and Harry has never hated her more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Of course, Mother.\u2019 Draco gets up and leaves, a shaking hand running through his hair. Harry sits and stares at the piano keys, his whole body trembling. A click of heels and Harry realises Narcissa hasn\u2019t left; she\u2019s come inside and stopped by the piano, a slim finger trailing the dark mirror-like surface.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I admit I\u2019m more than a little surprised,\u2019 she mutters, looking at Harry. Harry blushes. \u2018I\u2019d honestly thought my son was trying to deceive me. That you \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 indulged one of his caprices; his jokes. I see that I was wrong.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry understands why she says so. He also knows Malfoy has managed to fool her after all; this might not be a pretense to Harry anymore, not completely, and he\u2019d have thought the same of Malfoy \u2014 until a minute ago. Perhaps he\u2019d seen his mother standing outside the room before he\u2019d almost let Harry kiss him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She continues, unaware. \u2018How silly of me. Draco never jokes when it comes to you.\u2019 Her eyes shine brighter. \u2018You make him happy. I can tell.\u2019 She sweeps out of the room, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He pushes back the fall board gently and lays his forehead on the cool wood. The fact Will has been little in his thoughts all evening doesn\u2019t surprise him. Malfoy\u2019s taken up almost all of his headspace. Harry wants to kiss him quite badly, and he thinks Malfoy would like that, too. He tries to dissect the moment they had, trying to figure out if Malfoy had seen his mother; if he\u2019s, like he said, such a good actor that he fooled Harry into believing his crush is reciprocated.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Harry doubts Malfoy could fake the look in his eyes so convincingly. He recalls the evening in Malfoy\u2019s flat where Malfoy had stroked his fingers with an almost there touch. If they hadn\u2019t been interrupted, Harry suspects they might have kissed that night. No question about acting then; they\u2019d been alone.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shutting the door of the piano room behind him, he heads back. Voices drift from an ajar door on his left. Narcissa is hugging her son. Malfoy\u2019s saying, \u2018No more marriage talk, OK?\u2019, his voice shaky, and his mother strokes his hair and says, \u2018No more, my love, no more.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry doesn\u2019t mention this when Malfoy returns to the drawing room. Malfoy speaks briefly with Mrs Nithercott \u2014 the one with the pearls \u2014 and shakes her hand. His eyes keep straying to Harry and he ignores various guests eager to talk to him in favour of reaching Harry.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s heart is pounding. Malfoy looks hesitant, a rare expression on his face, and glowing as he smiles at Harry. Harry smiles back. A loaded silence blooms between them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Want to come back to mine for a nightcap?\u2019 Harry asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Want to come back to mine, watch TV or something?\u2019 Draco asks at the same time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They laugh, exhilarated. Harry bites his lip, unable to stop smiling. \u2018TV sounds\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A silver bear lands on the persian carpet at the same time as a bright hawk flies to Robards. The bear speaks with Maggie\u2019s voice, Harry\u2019s Auror partner. \u2018New home invasion. It\u2019s bad this time. Need you to come in.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry exchanges glances with Robards, who appears to have received the same message. Harry nods to him and turns to Malfoy. \u2018Raincheck? I\u2019m really sorry. <em>Really</em> sorry.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy looks sorry, too, but he hides it under a bracing smile. \u2018Keep the mirror with you. Call me when it\u2019s done. And don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry gives him a peck on the cheek. \u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The voice is familiar. So is the smell. Harry tries to open his eyes but they won\u2019t budge. He forces them open only to close them again when the brightness hurts his head. He\u2019s not at home. A whirring ceiling fan; lots of white; calm voices still talking on the edge of his hearing: he\u2019s in St Mungo\u2019s.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry groans as he recalls solving the home invasion case, the duel, the curses bouncing everywhere, him jumping in front of one to save a crying, terrified wizard.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The familiar voice talks to a non-familiar voice. He should know the familiar voice, but his head is fuzzy and heavy, slow to respond. Images of rumpled sheets, cups of steamy tea, a dog\u2019s wagging tail blink in his head as the voice explains something.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will! Harry turns his head fast, grunting at the pain in his neck. The voices pause. Footsteps reach him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Are you awake, Harry?\u2019 Will\u2019s face hovers over him. His ex takes Harry\u2019s hand in his and smiles. \u2018All right there, old boy? You gave me quite a scare.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Is Maggie\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018She\u2019s fine, she was the one who brought you here last night. You hit your head pretty hard. Bad concussion and you strained your neck, but the curse only grazed you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will\u2019s still holding his hand. It takes several moments for Harry\u2019s sluggish brain to remember they\u2019re not together anymore. He pulls it back abruptly, noticing Will\u2019s vaguely hurt expression before he turns to the nurse and asks her for the standard potions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s had concussions before. Not unusual in his line of work. He sits up, takes his potions when they\u2019re handed to him and tries to suppress the feeling of nausea. Will\u2019s still there, watching him intently. \u2018Can I go home?\u2019 Harry asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Not yet.\u2019 Will dismisses the nurse and sits on the edge of his bed. He takes Harry\u2019s wrist in his cool palm, the touch bringing to mind a hundred happy memories. \u2018You\u2019re not in a too bad shape, considering.\u2019 Will traces his thumb on Harry\u2019s inner wrist, sending shivers in his spine. \u2018Remember when you fought that troll against your boss\u2019s orders? Three broken ribs, a fractured wrist, sprained ankle, Merlin knows what else\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018The smell.\u2019 Harry smiles despite himself. \u2018You forgot the smell. You made me have a bath for the third time that day \u2014 only then you came in the tub with me and\u2026\u2019 The memory is sweet and painful at the same time.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You smelled like peaches for days afterwards.\u2019 Will smiles.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I never knew what made you buy that soap.\u2019 Harry had been teased incessantly by his colleagues and Ron.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You love peaches!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018To eat!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Their laughter fades as they stare into each other. So many things unsaid. So many things Harry had wanted to tell Will these past three months, to shout at him or seek forgiveness for. Harry had thought he was leaving the past behind him, but looking at Will with his hand on Harry\u2019s wrist makes it all too <em>present</em>. Too real.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry clears his throat. His brain is a muddle and he needs to change the subject. \u2018Can I play on Saturday?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Always keen.\u2019 Will lets go of Harry\u2019s wrist and casts a complicated swirl over Harry with his willow wand. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t advise it. Your balance will be shit for a day or two. You might have recovered by the weekend, but not fully. Shame,\u2019 he smiles, putting his wand away and making a note on a pad. \u2018I was looking forward to playing against you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s heart clenches. He\u2019d been looking forward to it, too, until Will decided they \u201cweren\u2019t working out.\u201d Pain and anger swirl with the nausea, adding to the fogginess in his brain. \u2018Afraid you\u2019ll lose if I play?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will laughs \u2014 how can he remain so fucking calm \u2014 and explains that he holds his professional oath higher than his desire to win the match. \u2018Besides, I heard your team <em>sucks</em>. You\u2019re a great flyer, Harry, but just one player.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How do you know? Did you send spies?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Didn\u2019t have to. You invited one. Malfoy\u2019s been placing bets in the bookies, telling the world how bad your team is.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>Malfoy</em>. A fresh flood of memories assaults Harry: watching TV while snow fell outside the window, dancing in a club, the piano, the almost kiss. The last time they spoke through the mirror, the day after the soiree, Harry was still in the office, going over the evidence for the millionth time, and Malfoy read him the gossip pages and the reference to \u201cthe new couple you\u2019ve all heard about, who are so hot for each other that any place will do: even a not-so-dark corridor in someone else\u2019s house during a busy party.\u201d It\u2019d made Harry laugh and at the same time tingle with anticipation.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I have to say\u2026\u2019 Will\u2019s voice rings in his ears. \u2018I\u2019m quite surprised you started dating Malfoy. Never thought you\u2019d take up with a Death Eater.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry tenses. \u2018Perhaps I\u2019ve seen more of him and realised that he\u2019s more than a <em>former</em> Death Eater.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Well, he certainly seems to have a nice body.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018As does your Quidditch player.\u2019 Harry clenches his fists, his temper rising sharp and hot through the fog. \u2018What\u2019s it to you anyway? Last words you said to me were \u201cI can\u2019t take the fighting anymore, move out\u201d. Am I misremembering?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will gazes steadily at him. \u2018No. But I still care about you. Breaking up\u2026 felt like the right choice to make at the time. But I loved you, Harry.\u2019 His earnest voice washes over Harry and he has to shut his eyes. Will continues, \u2018Just because I ended things doesn\u2019t mean I stopped loving you from one day to the next. This has been hard for me, too. I\u2019ve missed you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The words Harry had wanted to hear for such a long time finally fall from Will\u2019s lips. Harry gazes at his handsome face, the thick eyebrows, the stubble, the full lower lip. He knows what it feels like to kiss every inch of that face. Under the lime robes, there\u2019s a body he knows as well as his own. Will\u2019s familiarity is a cocoon, so easy to fall into, to allow it to envelop you. Harry\u2019s rage simmers down as the potions take effect and he\u2019s left deflated.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Bella missed you, too.\u2019 Will gives him a rueful half-smile.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How is she?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Chasing squirrels as always.\u2019 Will purses his lips. \u2018Look, I know it\u2019s not my business. But I\u2019m really hoping you\u2019re not making decisions based on anger or \u2014 or pain. I know you have a temper. I\u2019ve experienced it. I just pray it isn\u2019t leading you to the wrong choices.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will\u2019s presumptuousness cuts through the memories that are tugging at Harry. Before he can reply, Will stands, picking up his notepad and ending the conversation. \u2018You can go home in about twenty minutes. The headache should be easing by now.\u2019 He cloaks himself in his professional manner, detached and cool. \u2018Take the week off work. Maggie knows, said she\u2019ll kick your butt if you show up at the office. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t allow you to Apparate out of here today. I\u2019d take you home myself, but I have the victims of your case to check up on. If you can\u2019t find someone to Side-Along you, please use the Floo in reception.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He pauses by the door and gives him a wistful smile. \u2018You look really good, Harry.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s alone in the room. It\u2019s a ward for Aurors, secure and restricted to the public. He lays his head back and tries to stop his mind from going over his conversation with Will again and again. Will\u2019s jealous, that much is clear. The scheme has worked. Harry should be pleased, but he\u2019s not sure what he feels. The fuzziness in his head retreats enough to allow him to get up and find his clothes. The Floo is usually a no-no, but a glance at his watch reveals that it\u2019s just gone one in the afternoon and Hermione will be in the courtrooms all this week, while Ron is keeping the shop on his own as George has to take care of the baby for a few days.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He dresses slowly, resigned to suffer the fireplaces, when his fingers brush against the mirror in his back pocket. He could ask Malfoy to Side-Along him. He\u2019s probably still in bed anyway. Peering in the mirror, he calls Malfoy\u2019s name.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Startled grey eyes look at him. \u2018Shh!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The mirror moves, showing a ceiling, possibly Muggle, probably institutional. \u2018Where are you?\u2019 Harry asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Quiet,\u2019 Malfoy hisses. The way he holds the mirror shows a door opening and closing, then more ceilings, definitely Muggle, and then another door. Tiles. A bathroom probably.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I thought you\u2019d be in bed still,\u2019 Harry says when Malfoy\u2019s grey eyes appear in the mirror. He feels a flutter in his chest that he tries to ignore.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Why would I be in bed at this time of day?\u2019 Malfoy asks. \u2018What do you take me for? On second thoughts, don\u2019t answer that.\u2019 His expression changes as he takes in Harry\u2019s face. \u2018Are you OK? Where are you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018St Mungo\u2019s. Solved the case. Er, I need someone to Side-Along me home, but if you\u2019re busy\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy disappears from the mirror entirely. Harry blinks. He calls his name a few times to no avail. There\u2019s no time to wonder what happened, because approximately thirty-five seconds later, Malfoy bursts into his room, followed by two yelling nurses.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018\u2026 not allowed!\u2019 one of them says, but Harry lifts his hand and she stops.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018He\u2019s here for me,\u2019 he says, and they retreat, not particularly happy. Harry sure hopes he beats them on Saturday.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What happened?\u2019 Malfoy says, rushing forward. He grabs Harry\u2019s arms, eyes running over him. \u2018Did you do something stupid?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Depends on your definition of stupid.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I take it that Granger\u2019s tales about your reckless bravery, which might better be described as <em>infinite stupidity</em>, were not an exaggeration then. How are you feeling?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He fusses over Harry, patting his arms and his back, and Harry smiles and relaxes into his touch. It feels nice to be fussed over.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019 Malfoy puts an arm around Harry\u2019s waist. \u2018Lean on me, shortie.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry snorts. \u2018I\u2019m not even two inches shorter than you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Still shorter.\u2019 Malfoy smiles to show he\u2019s teasing and pulls him tight. Harry relaxes into his arms and allows Malfoy to lead him out of the room. His fingers curl around Malfoy\u2019s waist and a thought slices bright through the fog: how he could let go, <em>truly let go</em>, and Malfoy would catch him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re almost at the lifts when Will emerges from a room and calls to him. \u2018Harry, turns out after all I can\u2014 <em>Ah</em>.\u2019 A hint of ice colours his voice. \u2018I\u2019m glad you found someone to take you home.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s too slow to respond, unlike Malfoy. \u2018Not <em>someone</em>, Burke. His boyfriend.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Pardon. I didn\u2019t recognise you without a drink in your hand.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy gives him a truly terrifying smile. \u2018I recognised you. That big head of yours. Hard to miss.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shoves past Will and enters the lift, his arm tight around Harry. Will is still looking in their direction when the door shuts. Even then, as the lift clanks downwards, patients and Healers entering and exiting on each floor, Malfoy doesn\u2019t relax his hold. Harry rests his head on his shoulder and wraps both arms around Malfoy\u2019s waist. \u2018You\u2019re good at this,\u2019 he murmurs against his woolen coat. He\u2019s not sure what he means: the pretense or the actual comforting. He feels drowsy, the brief excitement giving way to fatigue. Malfoy is silent until they reach the Apparition point. There, he clutches Harry, his fingers bruising. \u2018I\u2019d be so good at this, Harry,\u2019 Malfoy whispers, his lips brushing his forehead. \u2018So good, I promise.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry has no chance to ask him what he means. Before he knows it, they\u2019re at home, and Malfoy takes him upstairs, barking orders at Kreacher, who looks delighted with the bossy guest. Before Harry can thank Malfoy or scold him, he\u2019s asleep.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Night has fallen when Harry stirs in his warm bed. The fire crackles merrily accompanied by a soft snoring. Malfoy\u2019s asleep in an armchair, covered by a woolen throw.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Draco?\u2019 he calls out gently, but he\u2019s peaceful and Harry lets him sleep. He sits up, finds his glasses and examines the vials on his bedside table. He\u2019s to take two potions every six hours or so. He swallows two hearty sips, scrunching his face at the acrid taste, and heads to the loo. When he returns, having changed into a T-shirt and pyjama bottoms, he sees Malfoy\u2019s awake.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018How\u2019s your head?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Better.\u2019 Harry slips back in bed, leans on the headboard and stares at him. Malfoy stayed with him all day, well into the evening it seems. Harry feels his throat choking. \u2018Were you here the whole time?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Malfoy shrugs, always uncomfortable when Harry catches him being kind. \u2018I popped home to get some things. But I left your elf here to keep an eye on you while I was gone,\u2019 he adds anxiously, as if to reassure Harry that he didn\u2019t abandon him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Affection surges in Harry\u2019s chest. Malfoy\u2019s wearing a blue shirt, hair ruffled as if he ran his hands through it a lot, and Harry recalls the party and the piano room. The desire to touch Malfoy is overwhelming. \u2018Sit with me?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Of course.\u2019 Malfoy sits on the bed next to him and Harry slips his hand in his. Malfoy traces the old scar. <em>I must not tell lies.</em> \u2018So many scars,\u2019 Draco whispers. He\u2019s <em>Draco</em> now, Harry\u2019s privileged enough to see the person behind the fa\u00e7ade, the tenderness under the spines Draco likes to aim at the world. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I like this,\u2019 Harry says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018This?\u2019 Draco replies quietly. He strokes Harry\u2019s scar with his thumb. \u2018Or maybe this?\u2019 He links his hand with Harry\u2019s, fingers light on fingers. His smile tries for casual; his eyes betray him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018All of it,\u2019 Harry murmurs. He shifts closer, his shoulder bumping Draco\u2019s, and nuzzles his hair. \u2018This is also nice. Your hair\u2026\u2019 He lowers his head to Draco\u2019s neck. \u2018\u2026 and your smell. I like your smell.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s breathing hard. He turns to Harry and removes his glasses before he strokes his brow. \u2018I like your eyes,\u2019 he says, his palm flat on Harry\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They\u2019re face to face, gazing at each other, hands travelling on arms and slipping through hair. Harry\u2019s mouth is dry. He caresses Draco\u2019s cheek and reaches his lips. Tracing them, like he did before, he says, \u2018I like your lips. I <em>really</em> like your lips.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco swallows. \u2018I-I like yours, too.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s heart is about to burst. \u2018Can I kiss you on the lips, Draco? I\u2019d really like to kiss you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yes,\u2019 Draco breathes and Harry kisses him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps it\u2019s the concussion that makes him delirious, his body trembling with excitement, his skin tingling. Or perhaps it\u2019s Draco\u2019s taste, sweet and smoky and new and addictive. Harry can\u2019t imagine ever removing his lips from Draco\u2019s, or stopping his tongue from exploring Draco\u2019s mouth. He\u2019s dreamed of this kiss for days now and it\u2019s better than he\u2019d imagined; the wetness, the heat, the softness are thrilling in a way he hasn\u2019t felt in a long time. He hauls Draco closer and tilts his head and the kiss turns deep, slow, rapturous.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s blood is heating up, waking up every part of his body. Draco grabs at him almost painfully, rising on his knees to kiss Harry as if he can\u2019t reach deep enough, as if he\u2019s trying to burrow inside. Harry pulls him on his lap, pausing to stare at Draco\u2019s flushed face above him, hair on the forehead, eyes shining, lips wet. The happiness on his face is spellbinding.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry relishes his warm weight on his lap. Draco\u2019s thighs are strong on his and he runs his hands along them and up Draco\u2019s back to his shoulders, which he pulls towards him to kiss Draco again. \u2018Where can I touch you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s expression turns filthy. \u2018Well, seeing as it\u2019s you\u2026\u2019 he smiles and breathes in Harry\u2019s ear, \u2018\u2026 <em>everywhere</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry instantly lowers his hands, squeezes his arse.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco chuckles. \u2018What about you?\u2019 He trails his hands on Harry\u2019s chest over his T-shirt.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry meets his eyes, aroused and breathless. \u2018I\u2019m all yours.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a brief moment, Draco stares at him, breathing heavily. Then, a wild hunger spreads on his face and he bucks his hips, rubbing his erection against Harry\u2019s. He pulls Harry into a filthy kiss and ruts against him, his hands scrambling to get Harry\u2019s top off. Harry tugs at Draco\u2019s shirt blindly as heat gathers in his groin, making him harder. He rolls Draco onto his back and rips his shirt off, unzips his trousers, but in-between the kisses and the grinding and the touching undressing gets messy. Half their clothes end up on the floor, the others are in shreds and, with an impatient grunt, Harry grabs his wand and vanishes the rest. Propped over Draco, he presses his hips down and grinds. \u2018I want you so much,\u2019 he rasps. He nips Draco\u2019s neck, wanting to brand him, to make him his. \u2018Merlin, I <em>want</em> you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019ve no idea,\u2019 Draco says, panting. His thighs envelop Harry\u2019s hips and he grinds back, hot and flushed pink all over. \u2018I\u2019ve wanted this for a long time,\u2019 he confesses, his hands kneading Harry\u2019s arse, pressing him harder against him. \u2018Fuck, I want you inside me,\u2019 he gasps. \u2018I can\u2019t wait, I want you now.\u2019 He grunts when Harry grabs his arse without delay and dips his fingers inside the cleft, tracing his opening. \u2018Yes,\u2019 Draco rasps, \u2018yes, Harry, <em>do it</em>,\u2019 and he\u2019s sweaty and desperate and Harry knows it\u2019s all true: Draco <em>wants </em>him, he wants Harry so very much that it makes Harry\u2019s head spin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018My dirty, blond boy,\u2019 Harry murmurs against his lips as he slips a lube-coated finger inside Draco rather bluntly, but Draco doesn\u2019t complain. He arches his back and takes it, and Harry finger fucks him urgently until it slides easily in, and then he adds another. Draco\u2019s a vision on his bed, his white locks a mess on Harry\u2019s pillow, his chest glistening with sweat, neck arched, mouth swollen, honey-sweet when Harry captures it in his. Draco looks divine, an obscene golden angel, and Harry tells him how gorgeous he looks. He says, \u2018You look perfect here in my sheets, you look like a fucking angel,\u2019 and Draco laughs, startled, rolls Harry over and straddles him. \u2018I\u2019m the filthiest angel you can imagine,\u2019 and impales his arse on Harry\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps it\u2019s the concussion. Or perhaps it <em>is</em> Draco, but whichever it is, Harry\u2019s drowning under a wave of lust unlike anything he\u2019s known. Draco\u2019s the first man Harry has touched since Will, but he\u2019s also <em>Malfoy</em>, the boy he\u2019s known forever. It\u2019s new <em>and</em> familiar, bewildering in the best way, fucking exhilarating. Draco gyrates over him, a hand digging in Harry\u2019s chest, the other around his leaking cock, his arse hot and tight around Harry, and Harry can\u2019t hold back any longer. He grabs Draco\u2019s hips and fucks him breathlessly, pounding his sweet arse, drenched in sweat, his orgasm approaching like a fucking bullet. \u2018Yes, harder, Harry,\u2019 Draco gasps over him and Harry comes with a drawn-out gasp. Draco arches his back as Harry fills his arse, moaning <em>yes, yes, yes</em>, and comes in long stripes on Harry\u2019s stomach and chest. He licks his lips, eyes half-closed, and lies on Harry like a cat, sticky and sweaty and utterly wanton.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco rises eventually, cleans them up, but Harry won\u2019t let him stray far. He\u2019d like more, much more than this, he\u2019d like to kiss Draco all over and taste his cock and maybe fuck him again, longer and slower, but a slight headache starts pounding behind his eyes and Draco forbids more excitement. He slips under the covers and Harry pulls him in an embrace.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Figured you were the cuddly type,\u2019 Draco mocks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Harry laughs, his eyes closing, as Draco clings harder and tangles his leg with Harry\u2019s, \u2018<em>I\u2019m</em> the cuddly type.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco has no idea what the fuck is happening. He could be dreaming. Maybe <em>he</em>\u2019s the one with the concussion. Maybe he <em>dreamt</em> that he was in a lecture on Vernacular Architecture and Harry called him from the hospital and had sex with him later that night. Maybe it\u2019s all a lie, a delusion, a cruel fiction.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Draco feels the solid body against him, his skin against Harry\u2019s warm skin, tangible, <em>real;</em> and when he opens his eyes in the grey dawn light, he sees Harry\u2019s face right there, on the pillow next to his. Although Draco has a lot of sex, it\u2019s always a fleeting affair and he never sleeps next to anyone. A sense of wonder washes over Draco as he savours the intimacy; the sight of Harry\u2019s long dark eyelashes and his lovely mouth, soft in sleep; the perfect <em>trust</em> Harry exudes by sleeping peaceful and defenseless next to Draco. Even in his dreams, his fantasies of passionate snogs and furious, fast sex, Draco never imagined he\u2019d be allowed <em>this</em>: witnessing the serenity on Harry\u2019s face as he sleeps naked and quiet in warm covers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s happy. He\u2019s so very happy he could cast a hundred Patronuses.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A murmur alerts him that Harry\u2019s stirring. Harry\u2019s eyelashes flutter open, his lips part in a smile; he\u2019s about to say something, but Draco leans forward and kisses him. He holds on to him and kisses him and almost wishes time would stop and capture them like this: insects trapped in amber, preserved for eternity.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Sleep well?\u2019 Draco drags his lips on Harry\u2019s neck. Harry smells of sleep and sex, of sweat, of something woodsy. His morning erection is poking Draco\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry runs a hand along Draco\u2019s spine and gives him a lopsided smile. \u2018Best sleep in ages. Though, waking is shaping up to be pretty great, too.\u2019 He shuffles closer and bucks his hips against Draco\u2019s. His touch is tender, his kisses sweet and a little dazed. They\u2019re both a little dazed. They move in tandem, rubbing against each other, slow and sweet like treacle, sighing softly in the other\u2019s ear, and leaving lingering kisses on smooth skin. It\u2019s unbearably beautiful and Draco feels utterly lost. He\u2019ll never recover, not from this. He moves his leg over Harry\u2019s hip, bringing him closer, and feels fire spreading from his groin to every nerve ending in his body. Harry\u2019s cock is hard and hot against his, and the friction is the loveliest torture, bringing Draco to a toe-curling orgasm. When he comes, it\u2019s like something has cracked inside him and split him open and made him new.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They take breakfast in the cavernous kitchen; a stack of toast and some of <em>Jam Today</em>\u2019s finest. Harry offers him a mug of tea, ruffling Draco\u2019s hair as he does so.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco feigns irritation at the hair-messing and takes a sip. \u2018One sugar and a splash of milk. You remember.\u2019 Suppressing the urge to smother Harry with kisses, Draco affects a casual, nonchalant tone that fools precisely no one, not even the elf mending his ripped shirt in the corner.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It was drilled into me,\u2019 Harry teases. He stretches a leg to Draco\u2019s chair. \u2018What are your plans for the day? Where were you yesterday when I called?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco taps a finger on the mug; then he says, as casually as he can make it, \u2018I was at university. I had to leave a lecture to take your call.\u2019 He smiles at Harry\u2019s stunned look and says, \u2018I\u2019ve an assignment to hand in today so I\u2019ll need to Apparate there for an hour or so.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco wanted to keep Kent University for himself alone<em>. His</em> place, his secret, his refuge. Nothing about the campus reminds him of people or incidents he\u2019d rather forget. It\u2019s untainted by anything magical, anything that has to do with Voldemort, Death Eaters, werewolves, the war. It\u2019s a very precious location to him, which he shares with the one person who knows him inside out: Astoria. But now he wants Harry there. He wants Harry everywhere. \u2018Want to come with me?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They Apparate into the woods at the border of the campus, startling a crow, two magpies and a cyclist, who Harry quickly Obliviates. A biting wind hisses through the trees and the air smells of snow. Draco points at the buildings as they trudge up the slope across the frosty field. \u2018That\u2019s the library,\u2019 he says, \u2018and over there Eliot College\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry seems delighted to be there; perhaps he realises how important this place is for Draco. How this is where he\u2019s trying to discover who he is besides \u2014 or despite \u2014 his surname and his past. Harry\u2019s cheeks and nose are pink from the cold and he\u2019s wrapped in one of Draco\u2019s chunky scarves since Harry\u2019s wardrobe is sorely lacking in \u2014 well, everything. When they reach the School of Architecture, Draco points at a red canteen parked in the square. \u2018How about you get us some pad thai while I drop my assignment off?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s almost bouncing when he dashes to the computer room, prints his work and slips it inside his professor\u2019s pigeon hole. He greets a couple of familiar faces, wishes <em>Merry Christmas</em> to the secretary and returns outside. Harry is sitting at a picnic table in the square with two overloaded, steaming cartons and Draco pauses, his chest tight. He curls his nails in his palms, biting deep, but it\u2019s not a dream: Harry Potter is <em>here</em>, at Draco\u2019s university, <em>with</em> Draco. He swallows hard and allows himself to luxuriate in this: this unexpected, intense joy that makes his stomach flip. Taking a deep breath, relaxing his shoulders, he strides towards the picnic table. A Warming charm envelops him as he sits down and accepts his pad thai kung.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t know what to ask first,\u2019 Harry says, gesturing at the space around them. \u2018Architecture? Muggle? Kent?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco explains while they eat. \u2018Kent has a decent Architecture department and I liked the campus. Architecture was\u2014\u2019 He pauses for a moment before continuing, but Harry gives him time. He doesn\u2019t pressure Draco, and Draco likes that. \u2018After the war I thought long and hard about what I wanted. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to separate one\u2019s desires from \u2026 from one\u2019s family\u2019s wishes. I always liked to draw and buildings interest me and, well, here we are.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Muggle, though?\u2019 Harry asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco sighs exaggeratedly. \u2018Blame Astoria. I do.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry chuckles. \u2018You as a university student is the cutest thing I can imagine.\u2019 His expression slips from amusement to affection and then to desire. It\u2019s all Draco can do to retain any sort of dignity and stop himself from leaping across the table.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018We Confunded the Admissions Officer,\u2019 he confides to Harry \u2014 who says, \u2018A felony, but I didn\u2019t hear that\u2019 \u2014 and Draco relates how he pays fees, attends lectures, hands in assignments and tries to blend in as best he can. \u2018No one would hire me as an intern after the war,\u2019 he tells Harry, \u2018but now I\u2019ll have something to offer that few can. Magical construction is prohibitively expensive. By integrating Muggle techniques with magical theory, affordable housing for witches and wizards is possible. Granger and I have discussed it; theoretically. She doesn\u2019t know about my studies. We\u2019re sure, though, it\u2019s possible to create houses which combine the best of both worlds.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry looks impressed. \u2018I can\u2019t believe you kept all this secret. You give the impression that you just party all the time\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I stopped caring about the impression I give a long time ago,\u2019 Draco says. \u2018First, yes, I do like to indulge in my vices. Life\u2019s <em>jam today</em>, Harry. Not \u201cjam yesterday and tomorrow but never today\u201d. Although, yeah, in my case, it\u2019s mostly fags, booze and blow...\u2019 He looks at his food, throat tight, and decides to take a leap. \u2018And second, I\u2019d rather share what\u2019s important to me with the people who are important to me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He keeps his eyes lowered until the silence stretches a little too much. Nervously, he glances at Harry, who\u2019s pushed aside his empty carton and is staring at Draco, his eyes bright. \u2018I\u2019m important to you?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco clutches his wooden fork for support. \u2018Very,\u2019 he whispers. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry reaches out and takes Draco\u2019s hand in his. \u2018I like you a lot, Draco Malfoy. I kinda want to snog you right now, but I know some Muggles can be stupid about it and I don\u2019t want to have to use my wand. But I\u2019d also like to see your favourite spots here. Will you show me around?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This day is becoming the best day. Draco shows him everything: the cinema, the rose garden behind Darwin college, the view from the library. They explore the School of Architecture and snog inside a dark lecture theatre, Harry mouthing at Draco\u2019s neck and softly biting his skin, adding to the collection of lovebites Draco woke up with. Draco leads him to the laundry room, which confuses Harry, until he realises how exciting washing machines are for Draco and he bursts into laughter. Then, he cradles Draco\u2019s face and kisses him in the midst of a cloud of Ocean Breeze and Patchouli while the machines rumble in the background.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco tells him how Astoria first conceived the idea of attending a Muggle university as a way of learning about Muggles. \u2018She wants to teach Muggle studies in Hogwarts one day. She even befriended some students and two of them invited her to their dorm. It was rather awkward,\u2019 Draco says, \u2018when someone asked her to find the can opener so they\u2019d heat up some beans and she had no idea what it was. Apparently, can openers are very popular. Every household has one.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry bites his lip in an obvious attempt not to laugh. \u2018Yes, can openers are a big thing here.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco swats his arm. \u2018Stop taking the piss. I had no idea what the blasted thing was, either. I still don\u2019t actually. A hundred gadgets to replace a single wand\u2026\u2019 Harry\u2019s grinning, but the fatigue is clear on his face and Draco touches his arm. \u2018We\u2019ve been here for a while. Do you need to go back for some rest?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I want to go back, but not for rest,\u2019 Harry says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco takes him to his flat and informs Harry no sex will be forthcoming until he naps for an hour. Leaving Harry to get ready for sleep, Draco texts Astoria from the magic-proof den to tell her to make herself scarce today, and returns to his bedroom where Harry\u2019s <em>not</em> sleeping. Instead, he\u2019s lying on his side, naked, sporting an impressive hard-on and leering at Draco. Well, Draco\u2019s not a saint. He removes his clothes in the blink of an eye and pushes Harry on his back. \u2018I\u2019ve heard of this experimental treatment for concussions.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Really? What? Oh\u2014 <em>oh</em>\u2026\u2019 Harry gasps when Draco takes his cock in his mouth and sucks him dry.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They have a lot of sex that week, alternating from one\u2019s house to the other\u2019s flat and going from bed to sofa to shower to \u2014 once, memorably \u2014 Harry\u2019s pantry. Kreacher doesn\u2019t speak to them for days. They spend an evening with Granger and Weasley playing Exploding Snap in their flat. Granger\u2019s sporting the ring Draco helped Weasley choose and after the cards, they gather around the fire with elf-wine. Talk revolves around their upcoming betrothal.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Not a ball,\u2019 Granger\u2019s saying, \u2018we want something small, intimate. Just the families and some friends.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018On New Year\u2019s day,\u2019 Weasley adds. \u2018Symbolic and shit.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco glances at Harry in the firelight and tries to get rid of the images of Harry and him leaping over a fire hand-in-hand. It\u2019s unfathomably ridiculous. They\u2019ve only been shagging for four days, and he\u2019s not even sure what Harry wants from him \u2014 besides Draco\u2019s cock and arse. Draco has never had a relationship that lasted over a week and he fears he\u2019ll fuck up and lose Harry; he also fears Harry\u2019s just after some fun, nothing serious. Neither fear stops Draco from imagining a life with Harry as if they\u2019re starring in a fucking Muggle commercial. He blames his mother and her lectures on love magic. \u2018Betrothals are best done while young,\u2019 his mother had always advised. \u2018They involve delicate magic, bonding the partners but also testing them. Many couples fail to last a year and a day. But for the ones who do, a happy marriage is almost always guaranteed.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry nudges his foot and smiles at him, and Draco knows he\u2019s doomed. He can\u2019t imagine ever loving anyone as much as Harry. Harry\u2019s made of everything that\u2019s good in this world, a coruscating galaxy of fairness, passion, blazing devotion and a surprisingly wry humour, and if this doesn\u2019t work out for Draco, well \u2014 it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">To no one\u2019s surprise and everyone\u2019s exasperation, Harry insists he\u2019ll take part in the Quidditch charity match, egged on by his obsessive boss. \u2018Of course I\u2019ll play,\u2019 he says, sitting at Draco\u2019s kitchen island over bowls of carrot and coriander soup, \u2018the team needs me and besides, practice went <em>fine;</em> the first two days were hard, now I feel A-OK\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m going to fucking tie you in bed until after the game,\u2019 Draco tells him. \u2018What if you fall off your broom? Your balance has been\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Afraid I\u2019ll win the game and you\u2019ll lose your bet?\u2019 Harry crosses his arms.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m mostly afraid you\u2019re a bigger idiot than I\u2019d thought,\u2019 Draco snaps.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">They glare at each other for a moment. Harry tilts his head. \u2018Draco Malfoy, are you by any chance worried about me?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Ha! Of course not!\u2019 Draco lies through his teeth. \u2018I\u2019d just hate to see the Healers win when you fail to catch the Snitch due to your <em>broken neck</em>. I don\u2019t like Healers. Annoying, pedantic, pompous little shits.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Are you talking about all Healers or a particular one?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco purses his lips and stirs his soup. Burke\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been mentioned in the last five days he and Harry have been \u2026 shagging? Seeing each other? Draco doesn\u2019t want to utter it; it feels like a curse that would break the spell of whatever is happening between them. So stupid. He doesn\u2019t want another You-Know-Who between them, yet he feels unable to ask Harry about what\u2019ll come after tomorrow, after the match and the gala. Harry hasn\u2019t mentioned anything either, any plans for the Christmas holidays, nothing, as if the world will end tomorrow.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry comes and wraps his arms around Draco. \u2018I can do it,\u2019 he says. \u2018I can win the game. I can beat the Healers.\u2019 He kisses the top of Draco\u2019s head. \u2018I also wouldn\u2019t say no to the tying up, FYI.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Duly noted.\u2019 Draco shoves his fears to a dark corner and pulls Harry for a kiss, which turns hot and filthy. The carrot soup goes cold, but Draco is warm all over, perched on the counter with his legs around Harry, hips undulating slowly and mouths soft on each other\u2019s.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Saturday dawns cold and steel grey, threatening sleet, but the stadium is decked in festive colours, fighting against the gloominess. Pine-green banners with the Dementor Victim Clinic logo whip in the fierce air. <em>Recovery is possible</em>, it reads in curly letters, but Draco\u2019s father hasn\u2019t spoken since his second sojourn in prison, and Draco knows recovery isn\u2019t always possible when Voldemort has broken you good and proper. He shakes the unpleasant thoughts\u00a0out of his head and climbs the steps, trying to find his friends in the din. There are almost a thousand excited people, laughing and yelling and greeting each other. The families of the Healers and the Aurors occupy opposite sides of the stadium, waving banners with the St Mungo\u2019s or the DMLE\u2019s logo.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Granger\u2019s bouncy curls catch his eye behind the family of an Auror, their faces painted scarlet. He climbs the last two steps, sidestepping raucous children and loud teenagers, and flops on his seat with relief.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Just in time, the match is about to start,\u2019 Granger tells him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Astoria, in black denim and cherry red Doc Martens, gives Draco a wave from the row behind. Ginny Weasley sits next to her, brushing her fingers through Astoria\u2019s undercut and then sliding them deep in her hair. If it wasn\u2019t this loud, Draco\u2019s sure he\u2019d hear Astoria purr. Pansy is in Eurig\u2019s family\u2019s private box, to which Draco\u2019s been invited, but Draco would rather not make small talk with the Parkinsons and the Cadwalladers, and Blaise is somewhere with some witch he\u2019s started seeing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The seats are charmed against the cold, but not the pitch. Frost sparkles on the ground. The wind howls; it\u2019ll be easy to unseat players, especially anyone who\u2019s hit his head recently. Draco has his wand at the ready.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018There\u2019s a last minute change,\u2019 Weasley informs him, as the crowd clamours at the sight of the teams entering the pitch. Weasley has to yell in his ear to be heard. \u2018Maggie\u2019s on instead of Stevens.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That\u2019s good, he was atrocious,\u2019 Draco yells back. He takes out his Omnioculars and focuses on the two Captains shaking hands.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The teams kept the colours of their professional uniforms: lime green and scarlet. It\u2019s almost a Slytherin-Gryffindor game, and like in school, Draco only has eyes for one figure. Harry\u2019s fierce and beautiful, gorgeous in his leathers, his hair lashing in the wind, his eyes blazing as he stares at\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Burke. Harry\u2019s face doesn\u2019t betray any longing, but a mixture of emotions that Draco can\u2019t decipher. The intensity in his eyes should be burning Burke\u2019s skin, but Burke is giving back as good as he gets, staring right at Harry, and Draco removes the Omnioculars and lights a cigarette, trying to calm his racing heart. Jealousy is unnecessary. Burke is seeing someone else. Harry\u2019s happy, he thinks. Harry\u2019s happy with Draco. He thinks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The players soar in the sky and the game starts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Firsh from the Healers has possession of the Quaffle, passes to Bhatti, she misses \u2014 but Burke catches it, nice dive \u2014 dodges the Bludger \u2014 speeds to the goalposts \u2014 and another Bludger runs him off course, this one by Auror Baptiste. Quaffle is with the Aurors, Rashid to Wilson, back to Rashid, she swerves \u2014 she\u2019s fast, look at that, almost at the goalposts \u2014 Baptiste sends a Bludger out of her way \u2014 Aurors score!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Half of the stadium erupts in a deafening roar. Confetti falls on Draco\u2019s leather jacket and he brushes it off, as he sees the Healers regroup and launch a series of attacks. Robards lets in three goals in quick succession. Lime-green banners wave from the other side and the Weasley siblings groan every time Wilson from the Aurors fumbles a catch or Craine fails to feint convincingly. Robards proceeds to miss every single goal the Healer Chasers aim at him, bringing the score to ninety-twenty, but the Aurors\u2019 Beaters are not to be trifled with: these people know aggression. The last minute change has helped. Maggie Baptiste, Harry\u2019s partner, is small and in her forties, but she\u2019s truly bloodthirsty. Draco smirks when he notices how often she sends Bludgers at Burke\u2019s head and decides he might buy her some flowers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Halfway through the game, the sky delivers what it promised and sleet starts pouring in heavy, freezing sheets. It has the surprising effect of bolstering the Aurors. It makes sense, when Draco considers it. Aurors do spend a lot of time tailing suspects or chasing criminals in adverse conditions, unlike Healers who work in a cushy, heated hospital. Even more surprising is a surge in Robard\u2019s Keeping skills. He saves three goals, eyes like slits against his opponents, and Wood is shouting from below, \u2018Yes, Gawain! Use your killing instinct! Crush your enemies!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The game continues. \u2018Auror Wilson has the Quaffle \u2014 and drops it \u2014 Rashid dives, catches it \u2014 Firsh tries to block her but fails \u2014 and ouch! That collision must have been painful. Still hundred-forty for the Healers, and Healer Davidson is in possession\u2014\u2019 All the while, Harry\u2019s circling the pitch, closely tailed by his Healer counterpart.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018If Harry doesn\u2019t get the Snitch,\u2019 Astoria tells him, when she comes to sit next to Draco for a bit, sharing her hot crup, \u2018the Aurors will lose.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Not only will the Aurors lose, but the increasing ferocity of the wind is affecting play. Players are blown off course, missing the goalpost or passing to mid-air where a team player used to be before the wind shoved them somewhere else. Harry\u2019s swerving a little, unsteady on his Firebolt, but he keeps his seat. Draco discovers he can be concerned about Harry falling off his broom and at the same time aroused by the way Harry clenches his glorious arse and thighs to keep balanced.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">And suddenly he\u2019s gone \u2014 diving so fast towards the ground that Draco thinks he\u2019s fallen and whips out his wand. A collective gasp is heard by hundreds of mouths as Harry careens straight to the pitch, blurry in the sleet, tailed by the other Seeker.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Potter\u2019s speeding down \u2014 too fast, I think, he won\u2019t brake soon enough \u2014 but yes, he pulls out of the dive \u2014 he\u2019s caught the Snitch! Aurors win, a hundred to a hundred and ninety!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cheers and horns shake the stadium as Harry rises with the silver wings beating in his palm, a grin on his face. His team flies towards him for a mid-air hug, but Harry quickly disentangles himself, speeds towards the bleachers and comes to a stop in front of Draco.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The commentator is still blabbering. \u2018\u2014oh, would you look at that, people, the Boy Who Lived is\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco ignores the speaker\u2019s voice, because Harry\u2019s grinning at him, pale and tired and windswept, but radiant with joy. He offers the Snitch to Draco. \u2018This is yours. I got it for you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An audible awww from the spectators reverberates around the stadium, as Draco closes his hand around Harry\u2019s palm and kisses him. Harry\u2019s lips are freezing cold, and Draco\u2019s doing his best to warm them up with his own lips and his tongue. His white shirt and designer jeans are getting all wet from contact with Potter\u2019s soaking uniform, but Draco doesn\u2019t stop. He kisses Harry until he has no breath and then he kisses him some more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Celebratory drinks are in order. Down in reception, they all split up. Granger and Weasley leave to reserve tables in a Muggle pub. Ginny Weasley needs to \u201cpick up something from her place\u201d with Astoria, which is a euphemism if Draco ever heard one. Before she leaves, Astoria gives him a hug. He\u2019s missed her. He\u2019s been so busy with the last couple of days of term and Christmas gift-buying and Harry-shagging that he\u2019s only told her of the new development over a quick cappuccino in Shoreditch. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and grins. \u2018And you owe it all to me!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco huffs. \u2018Excuse <em>you</em>, but the\u2014\u2019 he drops his voice, \u2018\u2014deal was <em>my </em>idea.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You only came up with it, because <em>I </em>broke up with you. You\u2019re welcome.\u2019 Her eyes twinkle and she lets the crowd swallow her as she follows Ginny out of reception.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco lingers, waiting for Harry. He greets acquaintances from his parents\u2019 social circle, flips off the reporters asking for a quote, and smirks at Todd, who\u2019s with a handsome man waving a small scarlet flag; Draco thinks he might be Rashid\u2019s younger brother. The lifts from the private boxes open to reveal Pansy and Eurig. Pansy\u2019s matched her short leather skirt with a long cardigan, ankle boots and a Muggle baseball cup, because if there\u2019s one thing Pansy can do, that\u2019s accessorizing.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She grabs his shoulders. \u2018That was the most romantic shit I\u2019ve ever seen. Should\u2019ve bet money back in school, honestly. You two are <em>meant </em>for each other.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eurig on the other hand is none too pleased about Draco\u2019s tips that the Aurors sucked.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018They <em>did </em>suck,\u2019 Pansy says. \u2018One of them kept dropping the Quaffle.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I lost quite a bit of money today,\u2019 Eurig says, sounding unconcerned. \u2018Everyone I know bet against them based on what Draco said. You must have lost money, too.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco smiles. \u2018You were in school with us, Eurig. We\u2019ve all seen Harry in action. I for one learned <em>never</em> to bet against him.\u2019 Draco would like to be the person who would donate his immense earnings to a charity, but he\u2019s thinking he\u2019d rather take Harry for a trip. Somewhere in Europe maybe. Somewhere warm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Eventually, the reception empties. Draco plays with the snitch in his hand, marvelling at how such a mundane thing can become so precious to him. Robards exits in high spirits, telling a reporter, \u2018Winning was never our priority. We were happy to do our part for charity.\u2019 The reporter abandons him for Joaquin Villena, who gives a short speech about participation being what matters and some such rot, and follows, looking somber, the Head of Healers, who\u2019s not a happy woman. Most of the players soon cross the reception, answer some questions for the reporters and head out in the insistent sleet for the nearest pub.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Silence finally descends. Harry\u2019s taking ages, and Draco wonders if he can surprise him in the showers. He shoves the snitch in his pocket and walks down the corridor.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The changing room door is ajar. Draco pauses when he hears murmurs, peeks in.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s dressed, his backpack by his feet, talking to Burke, who\u2019s in a pair of grey trousers and nothing else. They\u2019re standing very close.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Ever since the other day, I can\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u2019 Burke says. \u2018I worry that letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. What do you say, Harry? Do you think you could give us a second chance?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry takes his ex\u2019s hands in his. \u2018You\u2019ve no idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to hear that.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco takes a step back, then another until his back bumps into a wall. He can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying now, but he doesn\u2019t need to. He should have known it wouldn\u2019t last. How dare he think that Harry was going to choose <em>him</em>; him instead of a Healer who was on the good side when it mattered. Sex with Draco and a relationship with a Death Eater are two very different things. A small bell at the back of Draco\u2019s head warns frantically that he might be going into shock, he might be having a heart attack, he might be doing <em>something,</em> because he literally can\u2019t breathe or think or move. His only thought is \u201chome\u201d. <em>Go home</em>. He Apparates instantly, Splinching himself only a little.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019ve no idea how long I\u2019ve wanted to hear that,\u2019 Harry tells his ex. \u2018For over two months, I dreamt about us getting back together.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m so happy to hear you say that,\u2019 Will exhales. \u2018I was afraid I\u2019d blown it. See, the thing with Joaquin\u2026 He\u2019s a great bloke, but \u2014 but with you I felt I was building a future. Perhaps, perhaps even a family.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry clutches Will\u2019s hands one last time. He closes his eyes, memorises the feel of his skin so he\u2019ll remember what his first boyfriend\u2019s hands felt like, and lets them go.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He lets Will go.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Will,\u2019 he says softly, \u2018I\u2019m not saying yes.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will\u2019s eyes snap to his face and Harry takes a deep breath. \u2018We <em>were</em> building something. But the foundations were shaky. You were right; it wasn\u2019t working out.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I-I see.\u2019 Will takes a step back, looking confused, shocked. Hurt. A crack echoes outside and they snap their heads in unison, but no one is out there. The corridor is empty.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So\u2026 that\u2019s it for you? You feel nothing now?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Of course I have feelings,\u2019 Harry says. \u2018It\u2019s just\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">How can he tell Will that he feels a surge of affection every time he glances at him, but (and it\u2019s a big but) all Harry can think of right now is running to Draco, who\u2019s waiting for him at reception. He\u2019s breathless with the need to kiss Draco, to hold him and taste him, even though it\u2019s been only half an hour since the last time they kissed. Harry\u2019s need for his touch is so acute that it has caught him unawares this past week, rearranging his insides until only the force of it remains.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Will seems to read all of this in Harry\u2019s face and he leans against his locker, rubbing his face. Harry wishes he knew if he made the right decision. Will\u2019s trustworthy. He gave Harry a <em>home</em> and he wants a family and Harry knows his good and his bad sides by now. He knows what he\u2019s getting with Will, unlike with Draco, who\u2019s a loose cannon to put it mildly. Harry has no idea if he and Draco have a future \u2014 if Draco wants a family, like Harry does. If he wants to continue their \u201cdeal\u201d and see where it takes them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But Harry wants to take the chance. He\u2019ll never forgive himself if he doesn\u2019t try.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Is it Malfoy then? You\u2019ve fallen for that \u2026 that <em>bastard</em>?\u2019 Will\u2019s anger cuts through Harry\u2019s thoughts and stirs his own. It\u2019s always been like this with them. Conversation with Will is a tennis match, each flinging shots at the other.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You don\u2019t know anything about Draco,\u2019 Harry says, his voice icy. \u2018You\u2019ve no fucking idea what he\u2019s like. And how <em>dare </em>you talk about my boyfriend like that.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019re such a fucking hypocrite, Harry. All that going on about the war and you go and fuck the man who did Voldemort\u2019s bidding.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018See,\u2019 Harry says, completely incensed now, \u2018once again you prove how fucking ignorant you are about everything. While you were <em>skiing</em> in Oslo and waiting patiently for people to finish killing each other and for the dust to settle, we had to make some fucking choices. And Draco made a whole lot of wrong ones, I grant you. But if <em>Hermione</em>\u2019s forgiven him, if Ron\u2019s forgiven him, if Bill\u2019s forgiven him, if Katie\u2019s forgiven him, if Luna\u2019s forgiven him, then <em>your</em> opinion counts for <em>fuck-all</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s blood is boiling. Every time he fights with Will proves how disastrous their arguments can be. Harry grabs his backpack and is about to storm out of the room, but stops at the door, rage still burning through his veins. \u2018When you know what it\u2019s like to have people <em>dying</em> because of your choices, <em>then</em> you can come and talk to me about Draco, or tell me I\u2019m \u201calways going on about the war.\u201d Until then, you can fuck off. Go suck your bloke\u2019s dick to amend for your pathetic performance today. We fucking beat you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He slams the door behind him and stalks to reception. His rage still flares bright and he wants to find Draco, Apparate home and <em>ravish</em> him. And then hold him tight all night, and to hell with the gala.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The reception is empty. Draco\u2019s nowhere. Harry checks the bleachers, but only the cleaners are there, vanishing the confetti and food wrappers. Despite Harry calling his name several times in the mirror, Draco doesn\u2019t answer. Suppressing a feeling of unease, Harry Apparates to the pub where the others are expecting him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Our champion!\u2019 they call when he enters, breaking in applause and cheers, garnering looks from the Muggles. Food and beverages litter the table and his friends are well on the way of intoxication. Everyone\u2019s there, Hermione and Ron, Maggie with her husband and her eldest daughter, Ginny and Astoria, even Neville, who had a \u201cHerbological emergency\u201d and missed the match, but has come down for the gala. Everyone\u2019s there but Draco.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After greeting everyone, patting Neville on the back, and sipping from a pint Ron hands him, Harry drags Astoria from Ginny\u2019s lap to a quiet corner. \u2018Have you seen Draco?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She\u2019s got all her piercings on display today and grins at him with a knowing look. \u2018Draco? Your <em>boyfriend</em>? The boyfriend you\u2019re snogging and shagging and <em>loooving</em>\u2014\u2019 She\u2019s a little tipsy and isn\u2019t taking this seriously.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Yes, <em>that</em> Draco. Is he here? Is he in the gents\u2019 or something?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She shrugs. \u2018Haven\u2019t seen him. He was waiting for you, last I saw him.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Great, thanks, you\u2019ve been a big help.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">She sticks her tongue out at him, but as she leaves, she turns and walks backwards. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be here. He\u2019s probably somewhere crying over that Snitch you gifted him. He\u2019s such a <em>sop</em>, I swear. Ahem, don\u2019t tell him I said that, though.\u2019 She flashes a last smile at him before she sits down.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry wishes she was right, but he has a niggling suspicion that something else is going on. He checks the loo just in case, and returns to interrupt a hushed conversation between his two best friends. \u2018Draco,\u2019 he tells them, leaning over their chairs. \u2018Where the fuck is he?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Would he be with his friends? Astoria said that Pansy had reservations at <em>Morton\u2019s</em> for six. Maybe he\u2019s gone with them.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018He\u2019s never not met me when he said he would.\u2019 It\u2019s baffling.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Have you checked at his place?\u2019 Ron suggests. \u2018Maybe he went to change or something. He does like his outfits.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry snorts. \u2018That\u2019s an understatement.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Why don\u2019t you go and have a look, and if he comes here in the meantime, I\u2019ll Patronus you,\u2019 Hermione offers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry nods, grateful. He kisses Hermione on the cheek, fist bumps Ron, and finds an empty toilet cubicle to Apparate to Knightsbridge.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry stops to buy flowers first. The feeling of unease is stronger now he\u2019s alone and the flowers provide some support. As he opts for rare blue tulips \u2014 although Draco has gardenias at home, Harry noticed several drawings of tulips in Draco\u2019s sketchbook \u2014 he wonders if the unease is simply a product of Harry\u2019s conversation with Will. Harry\u2019s made a decision that leaves him exhilarated when he considers it. He\u2019d wondered, those first couple of days of sleeping with Draco, what he\u2019d do if Will offered to have him back. Now he knows: he\u2019s all in. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Auror business again, Mr Potter?\u2019 Temples, the receptionist, asks when he sees him. Harry had flashed his badge the first time he visited Draco with Thai food and an apology, and Temples had been tactful enough not to enquire as to what Auror business involved takeaway.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry points at the bouquet. \u2018Not today.\u2019 Climbing the stairs, he can\u2019t shake off the memory of that first visit and clutches the tulips harder. If Draco\u2019s not at home, he\u2019ll have to surprise him with flowers at <em>Morton\u2019s</em>. The press will have a field day. Surprisingly, the thought doesn\u2019t bother him that much.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He knocks on Draco\u2019s door and waits for some time, tapping a foot on the welcome mat. Just when he\u2019s about to leave, it creaks open. Harry smiles nervously, feeling as if he\u2019s on a first date, only for his smile to fade when he takes in the sight of Draco\u2019s cold demeanour. His breath falters, but he assumes a light-hearted tone. \u2018Hey, I thought you\u2019d wait for me.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I had something to do.\u2019 Draco doesn\u2019t invite him in so Harry offers the bouquet.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018These are for you. Can I come in?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So many <em>gifts</em>.\u2019 Draco goes back inside his flat, leaving the door open. It\u2019s not an invitation, but he didn\u2019t shut the door in his face, so Harry takes it as half of one, and enters. He leaves the tulips on a side table since Draco\u2019s made no attempt to take them and follows him in the living room, feeling as if he took a wrong turn somewhere and has found himself in an unfamiliar land. He tries to steer the conversation to something concrete and familiar, like what time he\u2019ll pick Draco up for the gala.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Hey, so about tonight\u2026\u2019 Harry starts but Draco interrupts him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Tonight is ideal, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 he says casually, examining his nails. He leans back on the sofa, a leg crossed over the other in a relaxed pose, but the tendon pulsing in his neck betrays the tension running through him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Er, for what?\u2019\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018For breaking up.\u2019 Draco\u2019s voice is light, emotionless. \u2018I\u2019d say the gala is the best place to end our little charade.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s gone icy all over. \u2018<em>Charade</em>?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Well, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Every word Harry wants to say stops in his throat and chokes him. He breathes hard and looks at Draco, immaculate on his pristine white sofa, and tries to reconcile the past week\u2019s events with the man staring at him calmly, unconcerned. A finger tapping on the leather sofa is the only sign Draco isn\u2019t as relaxed as he appears to be. A long moment passes. When Harry speaks, his voice is strangled. \u2018So there never was any future for us.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Clearly.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And this past week\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For a fleeting second, Draco\u2019s expression becomes wounded but shifts, mercurial and fast, to one Harry\u2019s rather familiar with: crystal sharp cruelty. \u2018Listen, darling,\u2019 his accent a hot knife cutting into Harry, \u2018it was all good fun, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, I <em>am</em> giving it up for anybody. I was <em>bored</em>. You were <em>there</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s head is spinning. \u2018Your mother was right. This was a joke for you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It was.\u2019 Draco turns vicious eyes on him. \u2018I just wanted to fuck the <em>saviour</em>. Memorable; but I\u2019ve had better.\u2019 Every word coming from Draco\u2019s mouth is a cruel, calculated slap.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You\u2019re lying.\u2019 It\u2019s all Harry can think in the tornado of feelings that is laying pure devastation inside him: Draco\u2019s lying, lying, <em>lying.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Whatever gets you through the day, sweetheart. I\u2019ll meet you at the Ministry at nine, like promised, and am willing to break up spectacularly in front of everyone. I can make a good scene if I want to. Then you\u2019ll be free to pursue\u2014\u2019\u00a0Draco gulps and tenses, his body coiled. \u2018One last night and I\u2019ll never have to see you again,\u2019 he says, voice really low, and shuts his eyes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry stands and staggers towards the door. A crunched noise under his foot makes him look: it\u2019s the communication mirror, shattered in a thousand pieces. It\u2019s the sight of it, glittering shards on the wooden floor, which drives the point home for Harry. Draco wants nothing more to do with him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He pauses by the door and glances back at Draco, who\u2019s gone to the fireplace and is poking the fire, his back to Harry. Nothing makes sense. Harry has no idea how he could be so mistaken about what Draco really felt.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s voice is raspy. \u00a0\u2018Just go, Harry.\u2019 He won't even look at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s not sure he can manage to Apparate. He staggers down the steps, hails the Knight Bus and rides to Islington, clutching his stomach, sure he\u2019ll be sick any minute now.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Numb. That\u2019s what he feels. As if the fight has gone out of him. Harry wears his fancy suit from the soiree and stares at his mirror, not frowning or anything, just <em>numb</em>. Despite his aversion to wizarding parties, Harry had been looking forward to the gala, because he liked to watch Draco work a crowd. His caustic remarks and amusing bits of gossip made Harry laugh. Draco could make a party worth going to.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Taking the staff entrance, Harry mingles with the crowd pouring towards the atrium. Draco\u2019s dusting the ash off his shoulders by the Floos. He\u2019s worn no rings today, no accessories, nothing but an austere black suit over a black shirt, which makes him look ghostly pale. He doesn\u2019t meet Harry\u2019s eyes. They head towards the din down the corridor, stiff next to each other, not talking; two statues on a date.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A cacophony of voices, a whirl of movement, a riot of colour pummels Harry when he reaches the razzle-dazzle of the party. The Ministry has pulled out all the stops: blinking fairy lights, clumps of mistletoe, overflowing champagne, the throbbing sound of a bass, gaudy garlands snaking around the room, squeaking wishes to partygoers. \u00a0There must be a thousand people there and each one is adding to Harry\u2019s headache. His temples are throbbing, an insistent, dull ache he ignores. Faces slide close to him, talk to him, shake his hand; cameras flash in his face; someone shoves a glass in his hand; someone else asks for a quote. Harry replies in monosyllables, ignores the reporter, downs the drink. He and Draco have parted ways in the swarm. Draco is at the bar, downing shots, and Harry finds a corner to lean on and stare at him. He can\u2019t help it \u2014 he\u2019s always stared at Draco, even back in school when he hated him. Uninvited memories assault him: Draco\u2019s body under him, pale, arching in ecstasy. The \u2018wanted you forever\u2019 Draco whispered in his ear. The way he pressed close to Harry when they slept. How could he\u2014? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. It just <em>doesn\u2019t</em>, but the more Harry tries to figure out what happened, the more his chest hurts. Better to be numb.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco\u2019s eyes search the crowd until they land on Harry. He stares for a moment, his mouth working, and turns to the bar. An older man, late thirties probably, says something to Draco. The man grins at Draco\u2019s reply, slides his eyes over him. Harry burns with the desire to hurt the man. The idea <em>he</em> might be the one laying hands on Draco is destroying him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He shouldn\u2019t have come. Fuck Draco\u2019s wish for a public break-up. Harry heads to the exit, unable to tolerate this party any longer. In the street, he breathes in the night air. He starts to walk.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2248\u25ca\u2248</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco thought he knew torture. He\u2019d been sliced open \u2014 by Harry no less, he\u2019d been Crucioed by Voldemort, he\u2019d been terrorized by his aunt. Agony isn\u2019t an abstract concept for Draco, it\u2019s a reality he endured in his very bones for a long time. He\u2019s familiar with it just as he\u2019s familiar with the ridges of his wand.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But he\u2019s never been in <em>quite</em> such pain before. At the gala, he\u2019s mostly immobile by the bar, because his blood is lead. The food is ash in his mouth. He lights one cigarette after the other and forgets to smoke them. He can\u2019t feel his body, except for the pulsing, bleeding wound in his chest.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The man flirting with him at the bar disgusts him. He\u2019s not bad looking, sexy in an older man way, but the idea of touching anyone other than Harry \u2014 of having to go through life knowing what it feels like and then losing it\u2014 Draco feels sick. He excuses himself and escapes to the toilets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He splashes water on his face, bent over the sink and trying to stifle a wave of nausea. Draco wishes there was a potion for heartbreak, something that could make everything better, but not even magic can help there; nothing can. He\u2019s got to survive this all on his own.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The door lets in a man, who heads to the urinals. Draco straightens but doesn\u2019t leave. A hot spear of jealousy lances through his chest as he examines him from the corner of his eye. The bloke zips himself up and comes to the sinks, turns the tap on. Their eyes meet in the mirror.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Malfoy,\u2019 Burke says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Burke.\u2019 Draco doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s keeping him there, next to the man Harry prefers to be with.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018You must be happy,\u2019 Burke says.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018<em>Delighted</em>. About what?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Burke scowls. \u2018Did you think I had <em>no idea</em> all this time? Harry didn\u2019t, but it isn\u2019t the kind of thing he notices. Ever since I met you, I knew you fancied Harry. You wanted him. And,\u2019 he shakes his fingers to dry them off, \u2018now you have him.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 Draco says, \u2018<em>I </em>have him.\u2019 The mockery is stinging. \u2018You must think I\u2019m an idiot. I overheard you asking him to get back together in the changing rooms.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Burke\u2019s astonishment \u2014 Draco notices with some surprise \u2014 seems genuine. \u2018I did. And he turned me down. We had a blazing row,\u2019 he continues, turning back to the mirror and running a hand through his curls. \u2018To be fair\u2014 I think he\u2019s right after all. I miss him, but\u2014 he\u2019s too hung up on the past.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The fact that Draco is still on his feet is nothing less than miraculous. \u2018He turned you down? You\u2019re not going to get back together?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Didn\u2019t he tell you?\u2019 Burke asks, curious.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco hastens to sneer, even as his heart is pounding. \u2018I\u2019ve put his mouth to a different use all afternoon, Burke.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Burke\u2019s eyes run over Draco in distaste. \u2018No idea how he fell for you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">When he leaves, Draco clutches the porcelain sink for support. Harry came to see him with<em> flowers</em> and he \u2014 oh shit. Draco fucked everything up.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He weaves through the crowd, bumping into people, shoving them out of the way. Harry\u2019s not in the corner he saw him last. He dives onto the dancefloor around the swirling couples, attracting curious glances, and checks the other set of toilets. Harry\u2019s not at the bar or the buffet, nor with Kingsley or Robards. Maggie hasn\u2019t seen him. Finally, Draco finds the two people who are sure to know where he is and barely manages not to stomp his foot in frustration when they have no clue of Harry\u2019s whereabouts either.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What\u2019s it with you two today?\u2019 Granger says. \u2018He was looking for you at the pub and now you lost him, too\u2026\u2019 Her words trail off when she takes in his expression. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I might have fucked things up.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A sudden bubble of silence balloons around them. Weasley\u2019s tucking his wand back in his pocket. \u2018Explain.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco does, his eyes still searching the crowd for the tell-tale mess of hair. \u2018\u2026 but turns out Harry refused him, and I went and said\u2014\u2019 He can't bear to say more, furious\u00a0and ashamed of\u00a0the cruelty he unleashed towards Harry. He doesn't need to, though. Both their faces seem to understand and swift action ensues. Weasley casts a Patronus and Harry\u2019s stag appears a moment later, saying he\u2019s \u201cout for a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018When he\u2019s upset,\u2019 Granger says, \u2018he walks by the river. He likes to look at the London Eye.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Thank you, Granger.\u2019 Draco lands a quick peck on her cheek, but she grabs his forearm.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018What did we say?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He bows his head a little. \u2018<em>Hermione</em>.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018There, there. That didn\u2019t hurt, did it?\u2019 She beams at him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Weasley gives him a light shove. \u2018Go on then, mate, go get him.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco smiles at the stupid Gryffindors he\u2019s come to be so fond of, and runs.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Outside it\u2019s dark as only the darkest night of the year can be. Draco runs through little-travelled roads, past brooding government buildings, sulking guards and a frozen park. His breath puffs out like a cloud and his lungs are burning up with the effort, but he doesn\u2019t stop. He jogs along Thames, glancing at the few passers-by.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Eye looms across the river, but he\u2019s almost at Whitehall gardens before a figure leaning on the balustrade catches his eye. He can\u2019t make out hair or face in the darkness, but the man isn\u2019t hunched up as he should have been, out in this freezing night in just a smart suit.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco catches his breath, his heart beating fast, as a light snow starts falling. He\u2019s not sure he can take it if Harry rebuffs him, but he has to try. Draco approaches slowly, the caress of Harry\u2019s warming charm brushing against Draco\u2019s right side. Harry glances at him and immediately stiffens. He turns back to the Eye, but the warming charm expands to cover Draco.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Do you want to hear a story?\u2019 Draco asks.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry doesn\u2019t say yes, but he\u2019s not leaving either, so Draco plunges in. \u2018There was once a man, who was in love with a guy he knew from school. I mean, madly, head over heels, desperately in love. He never thought they\u2019d date, not in a million years, but somehow they got together. The man was the happiest man on earth. But, one cold morning, he decided to surprise the bloke he loved in the showers after a game\u2014\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry snaps his head back at him, starting to say something, but Draco presses on. \u2018The man he loved wasn\u2019t alone. He was talking to someone from his past, who was telling him they belonged together.\u2019 Draco can feel Harry\u2019s gaze burning on him, but he keeps his eyes across the river on the eternally spinning wheel. \u2018Our man, the hero of this story, fell into pieces. He left \u2014 Splinched himself, the idiot \u2014 and missed the second half of the conversation and then behaved like a total <em>wanker</em> to the man he loved.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Silence descends, soft as the snow dusting the boats bobbing gently on Thames. Draco dares to glance at Harry, who\u2019s staring at him. His expression is softening as he considers Draco\u2019s speech. Finally, Harry speaks. \u2018Where did you Splinch yourself?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco pouts. \u2018Here.\u2019 He shows the wound in the flesh of his palm. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to wank for a fortnight.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry purses his lips as if he\u2019s stifling a snort. He turns to gaze at the Eye and speaks in a casual tone. \u2018You could ask someone else to wank you. That other man in the story, maybe.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d up for it,\u2019 Draco admits. \u2018I fear I might have ruined things completely.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The snowflakes melt in their heat bubble, but the boats, the pavement and the balustrade are slowly turning white. A man walking his dog passes them, huffing into his hands. Draco waits, his heart pounding.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s still staring at the London Eye. \u2018About four-five months after the war, me, Hermione and Ron rode the Eye. We were so wound-up that day. We\u2019d been to Fred\u2019s grave, and we were pissed off at the Ministry still using Dementors, and I was hounded day and night by the press\u2026 We got a capsule on our own and sat on the carpet and looked at London falling away. All those huge buildings looked tiny. And I thought that perhaps we were too close to the ugliness, the war and the funerals and the trials, but once we had some distance from it, it\u2019d all feel small. It gave me hope, you know? That things <em>would </em>get better if only we were patient. That\u2019s why I come here when\u2014 It reminds me that pain can one day become so small that you can carry it inside you without breaking.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry\u2019s voice cracks a little. Draco presses closer, clasps Harry\u2019s hand, and Harry allows it. Draco is familiar with the pain he means; he squeezes Harry\u2019s hand tight, wanting to let him know he shares it. When Harry continues, his voice is steady. \u2018That was the day Hermione decided to start her anti-Dementor campaign even though she had no scrap of support from the Ministry. She\u2019d no idea you\u2019d step in and offer her money and connections. None of us truly believed we\u2019d ever manage to banish Dementors from Azkaban, but we did \u2014 you and Hermione did. Ron was in a bad way, too. He wasn\u2019t doing well those days, god, he wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s when he decided to quit Auror training and work with his brother. He grew close to his mum, helped her at home, and\u2014 who\u2019d have thought Ron would start making jam of all things. But it kept him <em>sane</em>. It kept him going. And the Prison Reformation Scheme kept Hermione going, and time passed and we\u2019re all happy now. We\u2019re doing OK, I think. And no,\u2019 he turns to Draco, \u2018you haven\u2019t ruined things.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Thank fuck,\u2019 Draco exhales, overwhelming relief crashing over him like a wave. Harry\u2019s already turned to him and Draco pulls him close, as close as it\u2019s possible for two bodies to come without merging. \u2018I was sure I fucked everything up \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean a <em>word</em> I said before in my flat, it was all a lie\u2026 I was so <em>hurt </em>when I thought\u2014 and I hurt <em>you</em> and I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u2019 He\u2019s blabbering and kissing Harry\u2019s cheeks and his mouth, and Harry\u2019s kissing him back and snow is swirling all around them.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco doesn\u2019t know if Harry\u2019s aware of doing it, but the temperature of the warming charm has risen, making Draco almost sweat in his suit. Draco likes to think it\u2019s because Harry\u2019s happy. He kisses him again, deep and urgent, his hands roaming Harry\u2019s body, wanting to touch every part of him at once. Eventually, one of them slides into Harry\u2019s hair. He tugs it and Harry moans and drags his mouth from Draco, lowering to suck at his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018That was quite a declaration of love,\u2019 Harry tells him, licking his ear. His hair is tickling Draco\u2019s face and his hands slide under Draco\u2019s jacket, strong and greedy.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco cradles Harry\u2019s face and looks him in the eye. There\u2019s a time for honesty and the time is now, no matter how terrified it makes him. \u2018I do love you, Harry Potter. I\u2019ve loved you for a long time. I can\u2019t imagine ever not loving you. The only thing I pretended was that I pretended I pretended.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry grins, his eyes dazed, full of joy and wonder. Draco kisses him again, not expecting a reciprocation of love. He knows Harry isn\u2019t there yet, but he\u2019s happy to wait. He\u2019s happy to try and make Harry love him. \u2018I couldn\u2019t bear the thought I\u2019d lost you. That I couldn\u2019t touch you again.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry clutches him tighter. \u2018Same. I know why you\u2019d think\u2014 but this week\u2014 what <em>you</em> make me feel\u2014\u2019 He drags warm lips over Draco\u2019s jaw. \u2018It\u2019s always been you on my mind, Draco. Ever since I was eleven, when all I wanted was to punch you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco laughs. His chest is light and he kisses Harry, because he simply can\u2019t stop. \u2018I can\u2019t wait to properly date you.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I thought that\u2019s what we were doing,\u2019 Harry says. \u2018Only now you won\u2019t be lying to your mother.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I\u2019m not,\u2019 Draco confesses. When Harry looks at him questioningly, he explains. \u2018I told her the truth at the Nithercott party. After she saw us at the piano, she told me how happy she was for me, and I couldn\u2019t bear lying anymore. It stopped being one of our games. So I confessed the lot: the arrangement and that I loved you and how it hurt; thinking you\u2019re feigning your attraction to me, hoping you\u2019re not. I was very much a Gryffindor,\u2019 he informs Harry, who laughs. \u2018I was all honest and direct and everything. Mother promised no more matchmaking.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So now everyone knows.\u2019 Harry has pushed Draco against the balustrade and is slowly unraveling him with his kisses and his caresses. \u2018Everyone knows you\u2019re mine.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018And you\u2019re mine, too,\u2019 Draco says, still a little stunned that this is real.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A voice at the back of Draco\u2019s mind suggests they should be finding a less public place, somewhere to kiss and love each other, somewhere to celebrate. The warming charm starts fading. Snowflakes powder Harry\u2019s hair and the cold creeps in. Draco holds Harry tight. \u2018Do you want to go back to the party? Or home?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Home,\u2019 Harry says, nuzzling Draco\u2019s hair. \u2018Take us home.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0<strong>8 months later</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Now, listen again: Elaine is the Hufflepuff, Portia is the Slytherin. You will talk to <em>Elaine</em>, <em>not</em> Portia. Repeat after me\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry rolls his eyes. \u2018I won\u2019t speak with Portia.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco smoothes down Harry\u2019s shirt. It\u2019s one of Draco\u2019s actually, but Harry likes to borrow them, as if he doesn\u2019t have enough of his clothes lying around in Draco\u2019s flat. \u2018Good. Not Portia. <em>Elaine.</em> You remember what happened the last time you talked with Portia.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Two hours later, Draco glances at Harry standing in the doorway and knows. \u2018You talked with Portia.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry just drops his head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So what\u2019s the damage?\u2019 he asks as Harry flops next to him. \u2018Go on, spill. Promised her the contents of your vault, your kidney, your firstborn?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Haha. Nothing so terrible. Just\u2026 er\u2026 Grimmauld Place,\u2019 Harry says this very low.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Grimmauld Place?! You gave them <em>your house</em>?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Not to <em>own</em>! Just\u2026 er \u2026 to use it for the kids. The building they\u2019re housed in is awful, very draughty. Half the children have colds, the others asthma\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018It\u2019s like I can hear Portia\u2019s voice,\u2019 Draco comments. \u2018Let me guess: you asked for a ridiculously low rent\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry drops his head lower.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018No rent? No rent?!\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018I don\u2019t need the money,\u2019 Harry shrugs, and as always it melts Draco\u2019s heart even as he wants to smack him on the head.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018So I wanted to ask,\u2019 Harry continues, \u2018if I can\u2026 er\u2026 move in with you? Seeing as I\u2019m homeless and all?\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco leans back and stares at Harry. He <em>had</em> found the timing of\u00a0Harry's visit suspect (only three weeks\u00a0after the last time they both met the kids at their Quidditch\u00a0game where Lily had clung on to\u00a0Draco for the entire visit) and now it\u2019s clear why. \u2018You fucking Slytherin-wannabe. Did you plan this?\u2019 It\u2019s not like Harry had to <em>ask</em>; he already spends most of the week at Draco\u2019s flat.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Harry gives him a smile. \u2018If I\u2019d planned this, I might have bought\u2014 hey, what\u2019s this in my pocket \u2014 I\u2019d have bought this.\u2019 He opens the velvet box.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco stares at the elegant platinum band. He can\u2019t breathe, he is literally dying of asphyxiation just when he\u2019s about to get engaged.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u2018Will you marry me, Draco?\u2019 Harry says. He looks serious, and really <em>really </em>intense. \u2018I know it hasn\u2019t been that long, but I really hope you\u2019ll say yes. Because I\u2019m homeless.\u2019</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Draco snorts, finally finding some air, and hauls Harry close. \u2018Of course I will, you conniving, adorable idiot.\u2019 He pushes Harry back on the sofa and kisses him breathlessly, while making a note to himself to exchange the ring hidden in his sock drawer for two sets of silver cufflinks. He wants them to look smashing at the betrothal.</p>"
