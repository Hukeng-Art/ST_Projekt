Like, the whole series is like that but like - any form of relationship between these two - romantic, platonic, father/son, etc - it all just hits me?<br>tbh I already have another chapter of this one written and a fourth planned (but that's it for now at least).</p>\n<p>So this definitely borrows (sometimes heavily) from IM1 - you'll recognize some lines I imagine, so obvious disclaimer that it's not mine I'm just adapting it.</p>\n<p>Okay folks! Here it is! Sorry it took so long! I literally moved across the world and life's been insane.

  "text": "<p>He\u2019d always figured the red and gold swirl of colour on his wrist would mean he was fated to be with another Gryffindor. He\u2019d figured it was just like his parents and found himself rather pleased him. Yet as time passed and Harry realized he didn\u2019t have a connection with any of his fellow Gryffindors - or any that he\u2019d met in the few years above and below him - he started to lose a bit of hope. Not that he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d find them, after all they were FATED and fate had always had a way of making sure he was where he needed to be in the end. But no - his worry was that if his soulmate was too much younger than him it would only be a platonic bond. Not that that was a problem either really, but he couldn\u2019t help but wish for a romantic bond - though he\u2019d accept and adore whoever and whatever he\u2019d been given.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But time kept passing, and he still hadn\u2019t felt that connection with anyone. </p>\n<p>It was 10 years after the war that he was woken out of a dead sleep, wrist burning. He jerked out of bed, shoving his glasses on his face to look at his wrist. He knew what a change to someone\u2019s soulmark could mean - but he could only feel a rush of overwhelming relief that the mark was still there -<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>not faded as it would be if his soulmate had died. Instead, the image had shifted - changed - and Harry could only state. It was no longer just a swirl of colour - now there were bolts of what he wanted to say were electricity cutting through it. It seemed rather fitting really - that his soulmate would have something to do with electricity - what with what were nearly lightning bolts forming on his wrist. He wondered if his own mark on his soulmates wrist looked similar. Then he frowned, staring harder at the mark. It wasn\u2019t just electricity that had changed the mark - it looked - it looked almost like - he paled. Like Death. He pushed out of bed, knowing he\u2019d no longer be able to sleep - and immediately moved towards the fireplace. He needed to talk to Hermione - and he needed to do it soon. Whatever had happened to his soulmate - he\u2019d nearly died. He wondered, with a pang, if upon his own death his soulmate had felt a similar fear - had felt a similar pain at the change that would\u2019ve come. Resolve strengthening, Harry decided that he would never allow his soulmate to be hurt in such a way again. All he has to do was find him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you considered the fact that he might be muggle?\u201d Hermione asked tentatively even as she regarded his mark closely, his wrist held gently in her hands. He gave a sharp nod that had her blinking at him in surprise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m nearly certain he is.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t sure what had brought on the realization except for the fact that the colours on his wrist were more metallic than those of Gryffindor and now with what was obviously a signifier of electricity, it would be nearly impossible for it to be a wizard. Technomancy was still a very small field and he knew everyone involved. None of them were Gryffindors, and none of them had any sort of relationship with electricity that would be able to be strong enough to be represented in a soul mark.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d She asked then and Harry gripped his wand tighter. It hasn\u2019t slipped his notice that the elder wand was in his hand, that it had been where his holly wand usually sat - but now wasn\u2019t the time or place to worry about what that meant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find him. I need your help.\u201d She blinked but nodded, jaw setting in the stubborn look he knew so well.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the internet.\u201d Then she looked at Harry and there was slight suspicion in her gaze. \u201cJust what are you planning on doing then?\u201d And Harry rubbed the back of his head, avoiding her gaze, feeling almost chagrined.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d see if our minds were connected.\u201d He gave a restless shrug. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even considered that he might be muggle - but if I lower my shields I should be able to reach out to him. He wouldn\u2019t have had any oclumency training being a Muggle and all so I should be able to find him.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>He stubbornly kept his gaze anywhere but on her so he jumped a little at her coming right into his space, wrapping him in a tight hug.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAll things considered, I think it\u2019s a good idea. Wherever he is, he\u2019s facing death. I think if there were ever a time to break the rules of privacy it would be now.\u201d And Harry just hugged her back just as tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight then. I\u2019m going to go harass Draco into letting me use his meditation room. I\u2019ll probably have the best luck reaching the farthest distance from there.\u201d And that wasn\u2019t something Hermione could argue, though she did roll her eyes at the fact that Harry and Draco still enjoyed needling each other despite their surprisingly strong friendship.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWell go on then. I have research to do.\u201d Harry beamed, pressing a quick kiss to her cheek before apparating away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony hurt. That was nothing new but it wasn\u2019t pleasant either. He squeezed his eyes shut against the reminder of what he\u2019d see as soon as he opened his eyes. He\u2019d see the car battery with its wires attaching it to his chest - and even the thought of it made him want to throw up in panic. He\u2019d already figured out how to replace the battery with a miniature arc reactor but the last bout of torture had left him weak and shaky and in no way capable of maneuvering tools the way he would need to in order to get all the wires <em>off</em> of him. Even as he had the thought he felt the panic crawling itself back up his throat - in the shake of his fingers that wanted to just <em>claw</em> this thing out of his chest whether it killed him be damned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The sudden wave of calm that washed over him had him going absolutely still. He could still feel his panic - but it was pushed back by - well he didn\u2019t know what.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My name is Harry.</em>\u201d A voice murmured - soft - kind - and he couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes now, looking around the space and seeing nobody but Yinsen who was still asleep on his own cot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>England</em>.\u201d The voice told him readily, and the accent matched the information but it still didn\u2019t explain how he could hear him. \u201c<em>Would you believe me if I told you it was magic?</em>\u201d So the voice could hear his thoughts even if he didn\u2019t speak them out loud?</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes I can hear you just fine. What\u2019s your name?</em>\u201d He thought of all the things people called him - had called him recently - and grimaced.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\u201d He asked instead, and they both knew he was asking for more than a name.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m your soulmate</em>.\u201d And the voice sounded almost, embarrassed? \u201c<em>I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t done this before - but I just assumed you were fine somewhere and that we\u2019d meet naturally.</em>\u201d The voice rambled. \u201c<em>But then the other night I woke up because my mark - well it changed. And I knew I had to find you.</em>\u201d There was steel in the voice now, a strength that belied the previous softness. \u201c<em>Our minds are connected but it still took me days to be able to find you.</em>\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know where I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Not exactly.</em>\u201d And now the voice sounded nervous. \u201c<em>I was hoping you\u2019d be able to tell me, actually.</em>\u201d Tony scoffed at that. He was going crazy. He was so desperate to be rescued that he\u2019d actually started hearing voices.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>While I can\u2019t say for sure whether or not you are otherwise crazy, I assure you, I am very real. And now that I\u2019ve found you I\u2019m going to actually find you. Tell me everything you can.</em>\u201d And well, Tony could think of no real reason not to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m going to kill every single one of them.</em>\u201d the voice - Harry - growled - and Tony couldn\u2019t help his snort of laughter. Yeah, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d expect the voice in his head to say. He could all but hear the voice roll his eyes and he could admit he didn\u2019t expect if he were to go crazy that the voice in his head would sass him this much.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m really not a figment of your imagination</em>. \u201d then there was a pause. \u201c<em>Now probably isn\u2019t the right time to tell you this, but I\u2019m a wizard.</em>\u201d now Tony knew he was crazy. <em>\u201cWould you stop thinking you\u2019re crazy? I\u2019m really a wizard. My name is Harry Potter and I\u2019m 27 years old. I live in London and went to a wizarding boarding school in Scotland called Hogwarts. How else do you think I\u2019d be able to speak directly into your mind?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured it was a soulmate thing.\u201d Tony admitted, because part of him couldn\u2019t help but hope beyond hope that Harry really was real. For the first time since the conversation started, Tony glanced down at the bandage tied around his wrist. With careful fingers he pulled it off and stared at the mark on his wrist. When he was younger it had been a lightning bolt that looked like it was on fire. Now, while the lightning bolt was still there it was faded behind a triangle inside which was a circle and a line that cut from the top of the triangle to the bottom.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Of course the bloody hollows are part of my mark.</em>\u201d Harry muttered. \u201c<em>Bloody self-important bastard can\u2019t even let me have my own soul mark.</em>\u201d the thought that someone else had a hold over Harry had a fresh bout of panic going through Tony - because if he did choose to believe that Harry was real and was really his soulmate, if someone else could control his mark wouldn\u2019t that make them more important to the other man? And then the person who was supposed to be all Tony\u2019s wouldn\u2019t actually be just his? And wasn\u2019t that just typical, and-</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Tony.</em>\u201d Harry cut in firmly, derailing his spiralling thoughts. \u201c<em>You\u2019re mine, and I\u2019m yours.</em>\u201d he couldn\u2019t help the thrill that rushed through him at hearing those words despite the fact that he was trapped in a cave with metal in his chest who even knew where. \u201c<em>The being I was speaking about isn\u2019t a person. It\u2019s - well you\u2019re not really going to believe this - but it\u2019s Death. I\u2019ll explain when we finally meet.</em>\u201d the door to where he was being kept started clanging as his captors started to unlock it and Tony shot to his feet, holding the battery tight to his chest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really coming to get me?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask, knowing the question was a weakness.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes.</em>\u201d and there was a near growl to the words. \u201c<em>I\u2019m going to find you and I\u2019m going to kill every single one of them. Until then, do me a favour? Try not to let them hurt you on purpose.</em>\u201d and Tony would argue if he hadn\u2019t known he was doing just that. He kept denying them what they wanted - for him to build them a weapon - but even he knew that they\u2019d only accept that for so long before they killed him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d he agreed, mind already whirling with a plan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I have to go, else I\u2019ll never be able to actually get to you.</em>\u201d Harry admitted, but before he left, he gave a parting shot, amusement lacing his tone. \u201c<em>I can\u2019t wait to see your face when you see that I\u2019m real</em>.\u201d and Tony could actually <em>feel</em> the other man leaving his thoughts. Well then. That certainly helped make it more believable. He faced the terrorists that flooded the room, exchanging a glance with Yinsen who\u2019d since joined him though he was watching him with something akin to curiosity. Tony just gave him a tight smile. He wasn\u2019t about to wait for his soulmate to come save him. If Harry existed, there was no way in hell he was going to let himself die in this cave. He was going to get himself out of there, and then he was going to find Harry.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took Harry 48 hours to track down where Tony was. He\u2019d made sure to keep in touch even if it was just a quick brush of minds - an assurance to both of them that they weren\u2019t alone - that there was somebody else there. He got flashes of a plan - flashes of the absolutely brilliant mind that was creating even as it was planning how to escape, working through the figures of math - the growing likelihood that Harry was real - the absolute burning surety that he could get himself out now that he had something to get himself out for. Part of Harry wanted to let him - he knew how important it was to be able to rely on yourself - to know you could manage when nobody else could - but he also knew there was no way in hell he would make Tony go through this alone anymore than he\u2019d already had to. He saw the suit come together - saw with absolute awe the weaponized metal armour - and knew without a certainty of a doubt that his soulmate was brilliant because he didn\u2019t believe for a second anybody else could even come close to managing this, let alone in a cave. He was just checking in, but also marvelling at the genius which had Tony preening - but then he saw through Tony\u2019s eyes as the leader of the group that held him came in - saw how he threatened Tony. He knew, from seeing the lust for power in the man\u2019s eyes, that he couldn\u2019t leave this even a moment longer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m coming.</em>\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony heard the words and did his best to fight the shiver that worked its way down his spine in response. All that bloodlust was to protect him, and he knew that should probably be a little terrifying but all he could feel was an absolute thrill that somebody cared about him enough to feel that. Somebody who hadn\u2019t even really met him - hadn\u2019t had to deal with all his weird quirks. He shook the thought off, knowing if Harry heard it he\u2019d scold him for putting himself down like that - and wasn\u2019t that a kick in the ass? Somebody who saw right through his brazen attitude to the fact that he <em>meant</em> every self-deprecating word he uttered. Somebody who wouldn\u2019t stand for it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He understood why Harry had sounded so furious - he\u2019d also seen the look in the other man\u2019s eyes - but also the glee at the thought of hurting somebody - of hurting Yinsen until he\u2019d argued for the man\u2019s life. He\u2019d seen it and understood that if he didn\u2019t get out he wouldn\u2019t get another chance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Yinsen ran out the door, gun blazing, he knew, deep down that the man wanted to die. When he found him bleeding out by the cave\u2019s exit, he knew that he couldn\u2019t do anything but forgive him. That didn\u2019t stop the burning anger from ripping itself through his chest - like an echo of the pain he\u2019d felt when the man dying beside him had saved his life - allowing him in some twisted way to meet his soulmate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Even as he made his way to the cave\u2019s entrance, blinding him for a moment, he heard a bang and flinched back, expecting impact. Nothing hit. Instead, another explosion sounded, followed by screams and gunfire. None of it directed at him. Another explosion sounded near by even as he stepped fully out into the sunlight - but nobody saw him - nobody was even facing him. Instead, they were all facing the figure in the middle of the camp, a man with wild black hair and impossibly green eyes wind whipping around him and a stick in his hand - a stick that seemed to be throwing brightly coloured bolts at anyone and everyone who tried to attack him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBombarda Maxima!\u201d the man shouted, exploding some of the crates of weapons and sending everyone near it flying, and oh - <em>oh </em>- Tony knew that voice. As if sensing him, the man - <em>Harry</em> - looked up and met his eyes, even through the mask. Then the asshole smirked before completely disappearing from sight. Tony couldn\u2019t even find it in himself to be surprised when Harry appeared right in front of him, smirk still in place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTold you I was real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about you wait until we get out of here to rub it in?\u201d Tony shot back, but he knew his voice had absolutely no bite in it. He was amazed by what he was witnessing, but not only that <em>humbled</em>. This man, this impossible man, had actually come for him. Even as he had the thought, Harry\u2019s expression softened, and he reached up to brush his fingers against the mask.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we get home I\u2019ll teach you how to see my thoughts as well.\u201d he promised, but Tony was stuck on the first half of the sentence - on <em>home</em>. Harry didn\u2019t just want to save him, he wanted to <em>stay</em>. He didn\u2019t even know how to begin explaining what that meant to him - didn\u2019t know if he wanted to, but Harry just gave him one last bright grin before stepping in front of him, wand whipping out in front of them and Tony could actually <em>see </em>the barrier of energy that formed. Then Harry was glancing back at him, mischievous sparkle in his gaze.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say now\u2019s about time to get out of here.\u201d and Tony, even in the middle of this desert, was delighted.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony was pouting. He knew it was childish, but damnit, he\u2019d worked <em>hard </em>to build that suit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you I was sorry.\u201d Harry shot back as they scrambled over a sand dunes under the burning hot sun. He offered his hand to help Tony reach the top and the man latched on instantly, despite his irritation. The moment they made contact it was like an electric shock, but neither of them pulled away. Tony had always been a touchy guy, and no matter how cringy he felt when people reached out towards him after days of torture, he wasn\u2019t about to turn down the chance to reach out to Harry.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI worked hard on it.\u201d he pouted instead, but he gripped Harry\u2019s hand tight in his own, not letting go even when he didn\u2019t need the help anymore. He didn\u2019t have the energy to hide the slump of relief when Harry just squeezed back and made no other move to dislodge him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But it would have been a bit suspicious if we appeared somewhere safe and sound with that metal contraption. This way they\u2019ll think you crash landed and we\u2019ve been wandering looking for help.\u201d and Tony knew it was a valid argument since it was probably exactly what would have happened if Harry hadn\u2019t been there, but it didn\u2019t sting any less to see his creation destroyed. \u201cPlus, help is close.\u201d that perked Tony up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid your magic tell you that?\u201d he asked, eager, and Harry offered him a smile before nodding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBefore I left I looked for that friend of yours - James Rhodes. He\u2019s been searching tirelessly for you. I couldn\u2019t exactly bring him with me without outing myself as a wizard-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait is that a secret? The whole magic thing?\u201d when Harry actually winced, Tony began to realize just how much Harry had done for him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a criminal offence to tell non-magical folk about magic.\u201d Harry admitted, looking anywhere but at Tony, his jaw set stubbornly. \u201cPunishable by jail and potentially worse.\u201d Tony could all but hear his back teeth grinding together. \u201cBut those people <em>hurt </em>you and I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, hey, no judgment here, green eyes. I just wanted to know how much I could say.\u201d the gratitude in Harry\u2019s gaze when he looked over actually threw him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Tony. Plus, as my soulmate, you should be exempt from that rule anyways.\u201d there was a spark in Harry\u2019s gaze that said <em>or else</em>. Tony couldn\u2019t help but preen at the fact that that look was for him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSo what were you saying about Rhodey?\u201d Harry blinked and then nodded, shielding his eyes so he could look into the distance, gaze scanning the barren landscape.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI put a tracking spell on him. And maybe a little nudge in this direction. I can feel it coming closer. He should be here soon.\u201d the sudden burst of panic that Harry would leave before Rhodey could arrive had Tony gripping his hand tighter and drew Harry\u2019s gaze.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying.\u201d and he knew he was being demanding but-</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not letting you out of my sight.\u201d and the words paired with a bright, but possessive grin, had Tony\u2019s thoughts short circuiting.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Good. Right.\u201d and Harry actually had the audacity to laugh at him. Tony shot him a withering glare, starting to walk again. It wasn\u2019t his fault that he wasn\u2019t at his most cohesive and charming when he\u2019d spent the last bit of time hidden away in a cave being tortured by terrorists.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Obviously having heard his thoughts, Harry\u2019s expression sobered, and Tony realized that he actually had no idea how long he\u2019d been there.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cToo long.\u201d Harry said darkly, but Tony couldn\u2019t help but be curious. He knew he\u2019d been severely injured at first, and that he\u2019d probably been unconscious for a fair amount of time before he\u2019d healed enough to be aware of the world around him. On top of that, it had definitely been at least a few days before his brain had been decluttered enough to make sense of what was going on beyond the fact that <em>no</em> he would <em>not</em> build weapons. It wasn\u2019t until then that he\u2019d first spoken to Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took almost a month to get through to you.\u201d Harry admitted, brow pinched as his eyes darted between meeting Tony\u2019s own and his chest where the arc reactor now sat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t - I couldn\u2019t reach through to ease your pain.\u201d and Tony could only stare.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d the shrug he got in return was restless.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur minds are connected, not to mention our souls.\u201d and Tony knew that was the definition of soulmate really but it still seemed overwhelming to him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to do it for just anyone. Just you.\u201d Harry admitted.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he drawled, \u201cBut how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve taken some of it myself at least.\u201d Harry muttered, and that drew Tony up short.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry\u2019s gaze was wary but defiant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve taken your pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean just take it away from me. You mean literally. That you would\u2019ve felt it instead.\u201d Tony clarified, speaking slow, and Harry scowled but gave a decisive nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d For the first time in a long time, Tony\u2019s mind was absolutely blank. Then the reality of what Harry was saying crashed back down and his mind went a mile a minute.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d Harry\u2019s scowl darkened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my soulmate. And I\u2019ve been in your mind. I know you would do the same if you could.\u201d and Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed because <em>rude </em>he had an image of a heartless narcissistic asshole to uphold.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019d do it.\u201d Tony shot back instead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIs it so hard to believe that I just wouldn\u2019t want you to be in pain?\u201d Harry asked, voice tight.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony wasn\u2019t a genius for nothing. He knew people better than people assumed he did - he also just found it easier when they waived him off as the drunk, abrasive, playboy because that at least let him observe those around him in peace. He could see just what Harry wasn\u2019t saying - just why it was no big deal for him to talk about taking Tony\u2019s pain; because it came with a footnote. He didn\u2019t want Tony to be in pain, that he could feel was absolutely true, but what he wasn\u2019t saying was that he knew he could take it. He knew he could take it because he\u2019d felt that sort of pain before. Giving a decisive nod of his own, Tony reached out with his free hand, brushing the tips of his fingers across Harry\u2019s cheek.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m glad you couldn\u2019t.\u201d and Harry just stared, and stared, and stared. Long enough that Tony worried he\u2019d done or said something wrong. But then the smallest and sweetest of smiles split across Harry\u2019s features, and even in this awful place he knew he\u2019d nightmare about for months to come, he couldn\u2019t help but think of how beautiful he looked.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI can see why fate put us together.\u201d Harry said then, expression soft with affection Tony didn\u2019t think he deserved yet. \u201cWe\u2019re both self-sacrificing idiots. Maybe the hope is that we\u2019ll stop each other from doing anything too reckless.\u201d Tony opened his mouth to ask just what Harry was talking about - but then the soft thwip of helicopter blades cutting through the air caught his attention and he spun around, seeing the approaching vehicle in the distance; a black spot against the impossibly blue sky. The laughter bubbled up despite himself, and with his free hand he waved his arm above his head, shouting they were here despite the fact that he knew they couldn\u2019t hear him. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from running towards them as they landed either, dragging Harry behind him, but the other man kept up easily. It seemed he was almost nervous now because when they stopped, he kept darting glances between Tony and the approaching forms of military men. Tony placed himself in front of the other man now, their fingers entwined behind his back, even as made a clear barrier; that whatever was coming would have to go threw him first. He heard Harry huff out a breath and tossed a smirk over his shoulder.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t have them scaring you off now, can I sweetheart?\u201d and Harry wrinkled his nose at the pet name but Tony knew he didn\u2019t actually mind if the quirk of his lips and the laughter in his eyes had anything to say about it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTony!\u201d and Tony\u2019s whole body shuddered at the familiar voice. His fingers spazzemed around Harry\u2019s before he was letting go because he needed both his arms to latch onto Rhodey\u2019s form as the man all but barrelled into him, gripping him in a tight hug. They rocked back and forth and Tony didn\u2019t realize he was laughing until the tears started and then all he could do was shake and grip Rhodey\u2019s uniform as tightly as he could. \u201cI got you.\u201d his best friend was murmuring, and Tony just nodded. When he finally pulled back it was to wipe the tears from his cheeks, no doubt smudging dirt and oil around.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSourpatch, I want you to meet somebody.\u201d and if it had been anyone else Tony would\u2019ve laughed at the practically laser focus that Rhodey aimed on Harry. Rhodey\u2019s arm tightened around Tony\u2019s shoulder but Tony shifted so he could reach a hand out for Harry, reaching for his left hand. Harry obliged him, and when he reached out to take Tony\u2019s hand he allowed his soul mark to be on full display. Tony delighted in Rhodey\u2019s gasp.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cGummybear, meet my soulmate, Harry Potter.\u201d and Harry flashed a lightning grin, offering his free hand for Rhodey to shake.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honour. I\u2019ve already heard loads about you.\u201d and Rhodey shook his head, slow smile forming, and it crinkled in the corners of his eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you, Tones, would meet your soulmate while kidnapped.\u201d Tony sent him a beaming grin, though he leaned more heavily against his friend. All this heat and everything was really starting to get to him. Rhodey shifted to support his weight even as Harry moved to his other side, keeping him between them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry had known even before he disappeared into the desert to find Tony that his soulmate was a genius. He\u2019d known he was rich and famous too - had known he was fairly controversial by Hermione\u2019s expression alone - but it hadn\u2019t quite hit home that he was quite this level of celebrity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He\u2019d stayed at Tony\u2019s side for the whole plane ride home. Watched him greet his personal assistant (and he hadn\u2019t realized people in the normal world actually had those though he really should\u2019ve expected no less from what he was learning about Tony), and request nothing less than a cheeseburger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>What also surprised him was how easily everyone capitulated to his whims despite the fact that they could harm him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Harry cut in firmly when it seemed like they were actually going to order fast food. Tony shot him a disbelieving look. Harry stood firm. \u201cYour body won\u2019t be able to handle the grease. I, for one, don\u2019t want to watch you throw up all over yourself.\u201d and he knew the words were harsh, but why wasn\u2019t anyone else stepping in? He squeezed Tony\u2019s hand that had latched onto his the moment they were settled in the car. \u201cAre you really going to make me watch you hurt yourself for a cheeseburger?\u201d Tony deflated immediately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNo. But I still want that press conference.\u201d Harry shrugged.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSeems fair. After all, there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be making any rash decisions after not having slept for three days, crash landing in the desert, and a fair amount of exposure. But yes, why not show yourself to the public media and make decisions about a future you have no set plans for?\u201d Tony shot him a withering look, but in contrast his hand gripped Harry\u2019s tighter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe\u2019ll go home.\u201d Harry beamed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll cook for you.\u201d which immediately brightened Tony\u2019s mood.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWill you wear an apron?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if it has frills.\u201d and Tony paused for barely a nano second before he cackled. And so he\u2019d managed to get Tony home, fed, and in bed. At this point, he was only mildly surprised when Tony dragged him along - wrapping around him like an octopus before he fell asleep. Harry was just glad he\u2019d managed to coax the man to drink a bottle of Dreamless Sleep before he\u2019d passed out.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Harry fell asleep soon after.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>14 hours later and he woke up, groggy and disoriented, and not at all surprised to see Tony still asleep. He was surprised that the man had hardly moved a muscle, apparently intent on keeping him in place even while unconscious. Harry carefully disentangled himself, searching for the bathroom.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>When he stepped back into the bedroom moments later, Tony was up and looking around in a panic, only relaxing when Harry came into sight.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d and Tony shrugged, still looking exhausted but no longer panicked. He made grabby hands and so Harry obliged him, crawling back into bed where Tony immediately draped across him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI still want that conference.\u201d he muttered into Harry\u2019s neck, and Harry just barely repressed the shiver from Tony\u2019s breath ghosting across his skin. Now definitely wasn\u2019t the time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat it is you want to say during this conference?\u201d Harry asked instead, and he could all but hear Tony\u2019s brain switching gears, clearly having expected more resistance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terrible idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the idea is yet.\u201d he reminded. Tony didn\u2019t answer right away, but when he did, his voice was hard as iron.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI want to shut down the weapons devision of Stark Industries.\u201d Harry tilted his head, considering. From what he understood, Stark Industries was the leading force in weapons manufacturing in the United States, but it did have other interests.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He agreed, drawing the word out. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Tony shot up to a sitting position, gaping at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cStock will drop by a significant amount.\u201d Tony informed him, and Harry shrugged.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThe stock market has always been fickle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe board may try to lock me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou own the majority of the shares in the company, don\u2019t you? They can\u2019t actually keep you out long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will hurt my company\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to build a better one.\u201d Harry countered, and Tony just stared. \u201cI imagine that\u2019s what you have planned anyways, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He frowned in thought. \u201cI can\u2019t say I understand much about technology but I\u2019ve been trying to learn ever since I found out who you were. It\u2019s no use being your soulmate if I can\u2019t even carry a decent conversation, is it? And I was reading an article my friend showed me about the arc reactor.\u201d He snapped his fingers, remembering. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive one running one of the factories! But apparently it was impossible to make smaller.\u201d Harry grinned, positively beaming. \u201cThough you managed to prove them wrong, didn\u2019t you? Is that the plan then? Clean energy?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>But Tony didn\u2019t answer, he was too busy staring. When he\u2019d been staring for almost a minute, expression unreadable, Harry frowned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d The words earned him a laugh, but it was a nearly hysterical sound.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou started teaching yourself about modern science and technology so you could talk to me?\u201d And Harry frowned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re brilliant, Tony. And I won\u2019t be able to keep up with your intelligence in a lot of things, but I can at least learn enough to be a good sounding board.\u201d His smile now was shy, cheeks going pink. \u201cI was actually hoping that you\u2019d teach me some.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to teach you more?\u201d Harry\u2019s frown returned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do. I want to learn as much as I can about what you do.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cYou want to learn about magic too, I imagine. Don\u2019t you?\u201d And Tony nodded immediately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. As soon as I\u2019m in the lab I want to run full scans and see what kind of energy levels you emit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee? Exactly. Why is it such a surprise that I would want to learn about what makes you who you are?\u201d Tony didn\u2019t answer right away and it took all of Harry\u2019s will not to not just look in Tony\u2019s mind and find the answer he was looking for. Then the older man shook his head, offering a tentative smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you whatever you want to learn.\u201d And Harry was beginning to realize that these moments of vulnerability were something only he really saw. \u201cBut yeah - clean energy is the path I want to take. I was nearly killed by weapons I designed.\u201d And thinking back - Harry could recall seeing the name <em>Stark</em> on the sides of boxes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThen shut the rest down. I\u2019m not going anywhere, Tony. And as I\u2019m not particularly fond of the violence of war I can\u2019t say I mind much that you won\u2019t be as involved even if was peripherally for the most part.\u201d And there was one more moment where Tony just stared before his face split in a beaming grin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cCome on. I want to show you my lab.\u201d And then he was grabbing Harry\u2019s hand and dragging him along. \u201cJarvis?\u201d He called as they ran through the house, and Harry looked around, not having seen anyone else in the house the day before when they\u2019d arrived.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSir.\u201d And the voice came from all around them. Harry tripped over his own feet only staying upright since he had Tony to balance against. He looked around in surprise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jarvis. Think of it like a reverse meet the parents. He\u2019s one of my babies.\u201d And Harry\u2019s eyes lit with understanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d Tony flashed a grin.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHe is. Self-teaching artificial intelligence system.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Jarvis.\u201d Harry said in lieu of replying.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I presume that you are Mr. Potter?\u201d He blinked again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark uploaded as much data as he could from the cellphone of Colonel Rhodes.\u201d Harry chanced a glance at Tony who studiously looked everywhere but at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough chatter - I\u2019ve got things to build!\u201d But his eyes were tight when they finally met Harry\u2019s. \u201cI need an upgrade.\u201d And the metallic tap of the arc reactor had Harry sobering.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Will you be joining us, Jarvis?\u201d And the question was enough to ease at least some of the anxiety from Tony\u2019s eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cJarvis runs the entire house. He\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Harry just beamed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony liked to think that he was honest with himself, but honesty took a whole different level when faced with one Harry Potter. There was something about Harry that was so painfully honest that anytime Tony even <em>considered</em> bending the truth a little he felt awkward and out of sorts. Because not only did he feel weird about it, he also knew Harry trusted him to be honest - didn\u2019t even second guess trusting him. He knew for a fact Harry hadn\u2019t looked at his thoughts because he knew what that felt like now and knew the other man had kept to himself which Tony kinda missed if he was being honest <em>which he was</em>, because there was something about knowing the man who was his soulmate was close by without having to actually be close by.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It had got to the point where Harry didn\u2019t leave the room without telling him because it gave him such anxiety and Tony felt bad about it - in fact, the more relaxed Harry was, the worse he felt. Which was weird because it\u2019s not like Harry hadn\u2019t put his foot down on stuff - he\u2019d finally had that burger he\u2019d wanted after all, but it had taken 2 weeks of only home cooked food before Harry had allowed it and somehow he\u2019d brought Jarvis to his side so he hadn\u2019t even been able to order it behind Harry\u2019s back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>And not just that but with his next business venture. He knew it was going to be a rough change for the company, changing it like he was planning - and Harry hadn\u2019t even blinked. Sure he\u2019d made sure Tony had planned out a firm direction to take so he was prepared for the fallout but really that\u2019s something Tony needed to do anyways. When he\u2019d offered to show Harry the plans, the man had actually laughed and said he was nowhere near as brilliant as Tony and so probably wouldn\u2019t understand the intricacies but that he trusted Tony\u2019s judgment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Nobody ever trusted his judgment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>And Harry had been so good about his weirdness. His many quirks. Like whenever Pepper had come down he\u2019d taken the things she wanted to hand to Tony, setting them down within his reach for him to pick up. He hadn\u2019t even realized it was something that had bothered him until Harry had dealt with it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He\u2019d performed spell after (harmless) spell, his only caveat that he wouldn\u2019t perform anything that might put Tony in danger until they could confirm how Harry\u2019s magic would affect the arc reactor. What it meant was Harry wouldn\u2019t perform any spells on Tony, but that didn\u2019t stop him from casting them on everything else.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony wasn\u2019t sure what kind of energy levels most wizards held but he was pretty sure Harry had to be above the norm because the readings were insane.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Harry had even accompanied him to the press conference - hanging back but watching like a hawk. Tony didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever felt so safe in his life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>What <em>had</em> surprised him was the assumptions people made about the other man. He\u2019d known they\u2019d been seen together - after all Harry was by his side at pretty much all times - but as Tony had never been big on PDA with the people that actually mattered he should have realized that nobody would know that Harry was his soulmate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark - is that your new bodyguard?\u201d And the question shouldn\u2019t have surprised him but it still threw him off guard and he was so surprised he nearly laughed. He glanced at Harry who\u2019s bright green eyes were laughing but not opposed and decided - what the hell? It would certainly make explaining Harry\u2019s presence easier. And Harry did act like a bodyguard in some respects. Plus, for now at least, he didn\u2019t want to have to share Harry with the world. Nobody looked twice at a bodyguard but eyes of the world would be on Tony Stark\u2019s soulmate. The fact that Harry was actually very protective of him was a bit of a weird turn on for Tony.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d And he smirked and left it at that. After he dropped the bomb about Stark Industries, everyone was too focused on that to even give Harry a second thought.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThat went well.\u201d Harry noted as soon as they were away from the reporters. When Pepper shot him an incredulous look, he shrugged.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve definitely been the subject of worse.\u201d He shrugged, and that - that was something Tony would need more information about later, but overall Harry was right. That had gone about as well as it could have. Better, even, because he\u2019d immediately launched into his energy campaign and it had garnered some interest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Pepper was nodding now, already busy on her phone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as I expected.\u201d She\u2019d admitted, and Tony was glad Harry had suggested involving her because she\u2019d been a big help even if she didn\u2019t necessarily agree with the decision. Tony frowned as he tinkered on the stabilizer in his lab. If only the rest of his friends could be that supportive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSir, Colonel Rhodes is here. Mr. Potter is already going to meet him.\u201d And there was something like trepidation in Jarvis\u2019 voice. That, more than anything, caught Tony\u2019s attention. Quietly, because his curiosity outweighed everything else, he made his way up the stairs from his lab, staying out of sight.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you encourage this?\u201d Rhodey was demanding, and Tony flinched. He resigned himself to Harry at least listening to Rhodey - but he should have known better.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you <em>not</em>?\u201d And Harry\u2019s tone cut like a whip.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever faced down death? And I don\u2019t mean fear of dying. Have you ever known you were dying, and known that it was by your own hand? Inadvertently or not?\u201d And there was a simmering rage in Harry\u2019s voice similar to when he\u2019d threatened to kill for him. \u201cTony nearly died. We both nearly lost him. And despite how he\u2019s acting he\u2019s still hurt. He\u2019s got a foreign object in his chest that may never come out - and that\u2019s because a weapon he designed - a weapon with his name on it - nearly tore him to pieces. And you\u2019re angry that he doesn\u2019t want other people to hurt as he was hurt?\u201d Harry scoffed, and Tony had never felt so cared for before in his entire life. This man, this strange and impossibly magic man, was protecting him even when he didn\u2019t have to. He could\u2019ve dealt with Rhodey - and really he knew his friend would come around eventually - but the fact that Harry wouldn\u2019t even let it get that far was something he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to get used to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cStark Industries has a military contract.\u201d But Rhodey\u2019s voice was no longer as sure.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that was Howard\u2019s decision. As well as his dream. From what I understand, the man\u2019s lucky I wasn\u2019t around to meet him.\u201d And despite everything, Rhodey actually laughed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue that.\u201d There was a pause and Tony wished he could see their faces. \u201cYou\u2019re good for him.\u201d Rhodey finally said, and Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot good enough, I don\u2019t think.\u201d And Tony paled. Harry didn\u2019t think he was good enough? Had he done something to make Harry think he didn\u2019t appreciate him?</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, you just stood up, unarmed, against a fully trained military personnel to protect his feelings. I\u2019d say that\u2019s good enough.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cGood enough would have found him before he could get hurt in the first place.\u201d And <em>Oh</em>. Tony wanted to both laugh and cry at the same time. God, Harry was such an idiot. It seemed Rhodey felt the same way, because he laughed again.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re as bad as he is.\u201d Then there was a sigh. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t know you - I don\u2019t know how things work between the two of you - but since you\u2019ve been here, Tony\u2019s been in better shape than he\u2019s been his entire life. And from the sounds of it, you\u2019re just as hard on yourself as he is. My advice? Let him take care of you too. Before you burn out.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTony doesn\u2019t exhaust me as much as you obviously think he does.\u201d Came Harry\u2019s wry reply. There was a pause and then a sigh. It seemed Harry\u2019s honesty was about to strike again. \u201cI just - I\u2019ve got family back home. I know they\u2019re worried. But I won\u2019t leave Tony - I can\u2019t. And I can\u2019t have them here. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d Tony wanted to smack his head against the wall. He\u2019d been so selfish with Harry\u2019s time he hadn\u2019t even considered that there might be people worried about him. He was so used to being on his own that it was hard to imagine someone who wasn\u2019t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big house. And if Tony finds out you\u2019ve been unhappy about anything because you\u2019ve been taking care of him he\u2019ll become a whole other type of idiot.\u201d Harry chuckled.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten that impression, yeah.\u201d But it was affectionate. Shit. He was so screwed. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him about it.\u201d There was another pause but when he spoke again, that steel was back. \u201cBut Colonel Rhodes, if you hurt him like this again, inadvertent or not, it will be me you have to deal with. He may be fully capable of taking care of himself, but that in no way means he has to.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d And Tony knew Rhodey\u2019s voice enough to hear the respect in it. \u201cNow where is the genius?\u201d And Tony scrambled back down to his lab before he could get caught eavesdropping.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, when Harry had wrangled him out of the lab and so Tony in turn had dragged him to bed with him, he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSo - you\u2019re from England.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t a question since it had been one of the first things Harry had told him, but Harry confirmed it anyways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have family back in England?\u201d He meant it to come across as blas\u00e9 but when Harry didn\u2019t answer right away he knew it must\u2019ve sounded more strained than he\u2019d intended.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot technically.\u201d Harry said, voice far too light to be believable. \u201cBut there are people there I care for as family.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about them.\u201d Harry huffed out a breath and he knew he was caught.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHow much did you overhear?\u201d Tony tilted his head back to glare mutinously at Harry. Harry though, just looked amused.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cMost of it.\u201d Harry nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you asking because you want me to go visit them or because you want me to invite them here?\u201d He inquired. Tony\u2019s arms spasmed around him at the mention of his leaving and everything about Harry seemed to soften at the reaction. It was downright embarrassing. Tony also loved every second.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big house.\u201d He muttered, moving to shift away, but Harry caught hold of him before he could get far.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey - don\u2019t do that.\u201d Harry ordered, frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to be. My family - they understand that. They understand what you\u2019ve been through too.\u201d There was a fire in Harry\u2019s eyes that was full of pain. Tony hated it. He hated himself for putting it there.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about it. Before. All you want to talk about is me.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re what matters to me.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well, you matter to me.\u201d Tony shot back. \u201cAnd you make it sound like you have some sort of similar experience. Isn\u2019t that something people bond over?\u201d Harry actually winced.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you want? To hear about my pain? It won\u2019t compare to yours, Tony. I have never experienced what you have.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t a lie exactly - but Harry was staring at a spot in the distance instead of meeting his gaze. Since Harry had never lied to him, it put a gross taste in his mouth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBut you have been a prisoner.\u201d When Harry looked back at him, there was a soft banked anger that had never before been aimed at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYes. But it wasn\u2019t me who was tortured that time.\u201d Tony knew the qualifier was a slip of the tongue and he didn\u2019t like knowing that Harry had in fact been tortured before. \u201cIs this really want you want?\u201d Harry all but demanded now, and it wasn\u2019t, Tony realized. He didn\u2019t want anything that made Harry look like this - angry and hurt and ripped to pieces - but he couldn\u2019t take back what he\u2019d already said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d And he didn\u2019t even realize it was what he\u2019d been thinking until he\u2019d said it. Harry looked immediately appalled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I ever want to leave you?\u201d The question was so earnest that Tony knew he wasn\u2019t making fun - but he still didn\u2019t know how to answer it. When he remained silent, Harry sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. When he met Tony\u2019s gaze again, he offered a tired smile. An apology in and of itself. Because Tony didn\u2019t know anyone else who would ever even consider apologizing to him when he\u2019d been the one to almost start a fight.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Harry began, tone ironic. \u201cI thought I had a shit childhood. Turns out being locked in a cupboard isn\u2019t the only form of neglect.\u201d Tony\u2019s outrage was immediate but he tamped down on it, for now. He knew what Harry was really offering was a truce for the moment. Tony didn\u2019t want to pass that up, even if he wanted to destroy anyone who would even consider locking this beautiful man away. Harry pulled him back in and Tony went eagerly, clinging tightly. Jarvis obviously took this as a sign because the dimmed lights went out completely.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI want to meet them.\u201d He blurted out, arms tightening when Harry flinched in surprise. \u201cYour family. Maybe not all at once. But I want to meet them.\u201d He really did want to meet the people Harry considered family, but he also needed the assurance that Harry wasn\u2019t going to just up and leave. If his family came here, he\u2019d be less likely to want to go to them, right? Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow morning I\u2019m going to show you how to feel for my thoughts.\u201d Harry told him, yawning. \u201cI think you might actually believe that I don\u2019t want to be anywhere but here if you did.\u201d Tony had to fight the urge to ask to learn now. Instead,</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you wanted to talk to me that way sometimes too.\u201d Tony admitted into the softness of the dark, pressing his face to Harry\u2019s T-shirt clad shoulder. He immediately felt the brush of Harry\u2019s mind against his, but this time, instead of it fading away, it stayed warm and steady.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Goodnight, Tony</em>.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony woke to the low buzz of voices, and made a face. It was too early for voices. He opened his eyes and realized the windows were completely blacked out and he had no idea what time it actually was - but that Harry was definitely not in bed with him. Since he could still feel the warm weight that was Harry at the back of his mind, he sent a gentle probing thought towards it. Harry answered immediately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>It seems my family heard your invitation.</em>\u201d Came Harry\u2019s wry tone in his thoughts. \u201c<em>My two best mates are here.</em>\u201d And in the span of what could only have been a second he had flashing images of a pair - almost like watching a reel of them growing up. It was obviously heavily edited but for now Tony knew enough to be comfortable around these two people who\u2019d been veritable strangers moments before. \u201c<em>Come out whenever you\u2019re ready. I made breakfast</em>.\u201d The words had Tony scrambling out of bed. Harry\u2019s cooking was definitely worth getting up for.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He stumbled into the kitchen fully dressed if not fully coherent and slumped into Harry who easily took his weight even while pressing a cup of coffee into his hands.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>A snort of laughter had him looking up to see a tall red headed man watching them with amusement. It was a little disorienting knowing exactly who this was and why he was important, but Tony also thought he probably would\u2019ve wanted to crawl out of his own skin if he hadn\u2019t known what he did.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cRon.\u201d He greeted, inhaling half his coffee with a sigh of bliss. Then he turned his head from where he\u2019d settled it in the crook of Harry\u2019s neck, looking for the woman he knew to also be here. She stepped into his view, looking just as amused as Ron, and Tony offered her a little wave. \u201cHermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet you, Tony. You\u2019re all Harry talks about.\u201d And the words weren\u2019t patronizing but full of affection as she looked at the man in question. Tony leaned back so he could look at Harry too and felt the grin stretching across his features as he watched the blush cover Harry\u2019s. He downed the rest of his coffee and pressed an affectionate kiss to Harry\u2019s cheek before going to pour himself another cup, no longer feeling as disoriented with the first hit of caffeine slowly buzzing through his system.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the salacious details I hope.\u201d Was what Tony shot back, and Hermione laughed even as Ron made a face.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBlimey. Please don\u2019t.\u201d Ron muttered, sounding aggrieved, and Tony smirked over his second cup, meeting Harry\u2019s gaze across the kitchen and wiggling his eyebrows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, babe, should we regale them with our escapades?\u201d And Harry\u2019s eyes were bright with mischief as he smirked right back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWould only be fair. After all, I heard much more about them than I would\u2019ve liked.\u201d And Hermione immediately turned a narrow eyed gaze on Ron, swatting him in the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi!\u201d Ron objected, and Harry snickered.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWell I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt your delicate sensibilities.\u201d Tony mocked, moving back to where Harry had settled in a chair. He immediately draped across his lap, settling in. He didn\u2019t see the affectionate look Harry gave him as he wound a steadying arm around him or the amused glance Ron and Hermione exchanged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be hungry.\u201d Hermione said then, immediately changing the subject. And then before his very eyes a plate floated over in front of him, followed immediately by 3 other place settings. Tony looked to Harry with wide, excited eyes and Harry grinned at his excitement.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTa for that Hermione. I\u2019d been keeping household magic to a minimum. I was trying to ease him into it.\u201d Hermione just rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Because you\u2019re such a model citizen for thinking before you act.\u201d Harry shot her a narrow eyed look, though his mouth twitched up at the corner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to damage my reputation as a Gryffindor.\u201d He tossed back. \u201cHow am I supposed to bravely rush in if I pause for thought?\u201d Harry asked glibly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cDid Harry tell you where we were?\u201d Tony found himself interrupting. As much as he enjoyed the easy back and forth, he couldn\u2019t figure out how they\u2019d got here so quickly without Harry knowing they were coming. Hermione\u2019s expression immediately sobered.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually something I wanted to talk to you about, both of you. We should put up anti apparition wards on the house. As well as some protective ones.\u201d Harry was nodding along, but spared a glance for Tony. With the glance came a whole other rush of images - explaining apparition and other forms of Wizarding travels as well as the wards against them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how you got here? Apparating?\u201d Tony asked, and Hermione shook her head, lifting her wrist to show off the gold bangle there. \u201cPortkey?\u201d Tony guessed, thinking over what he\u2019d seen, and she nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll three of us have two. One keyed to each of the others.\u201d At Tony\u2019s look of surprise, Hermione glanced at Harry, hesitating. Tony turned his head as well, narrowing his gaze. Harry sighed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that thing I haven\u2019t wanted to talk about until you were better?\u201d And since the argument had been the night before, Tony nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s because of that.\u201d When he looked back at Ron and Hermione, the two were holding hands, both looking a little pale. It became increasingly clear just why they had the portkeys that lead to each other. These were the people Harry had been kidnapped with. The people he\u2019d been tortured with. He didn\u2019t press any further because he didn\u2019t have to like it to know he had a lot of healing to do before he\u2019d even be close to ready to talking about it. He immediately changed the subject.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSo this seems like a good time to announce it as any. I finished my new suit.\u201d Ron and Hermione looked perplexed but Harry was delighted.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAlready? That\u2019s brilliant. Are you going to show us then?\u201d And Tony smirked, standing and offering his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously. Come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>It seemed the arrival of Ron and Hermione was the precursor for everyone they knew collectively showing up on the doorstep. Ron and Hermione had helped set up the anti apparition and other important protective measures, and so Tony had the unique pleasure of being able to watch people pop in and out of existence on the driveway. At this point he was fairly certain he\u2019d met every single person who was important to Harry - all of them having shown up at the front door in the past week.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>However, the issue wasn\u2019t with those Harry knew - it was Harry\u2019s reaction to Obie.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry wasn\u2019t sure what it was about Obadiah Stane that put him so on edge - but something about the man was like salt in a wound. When the man had shown up, Harry had instinctively retreated - fading into the background before he\u2019d even fully registered he was doing it. It got the desired result - the man barely even spared him a glance. Tony had shot him a confused look\u00a0but gone along with it - luckily trusting him enough not to question him until they were on their own. Harry was more grateful for that trust than anything else because he knew there were secrets between them - but he hardly thought it was the time to mention he\u2019d been raised to be murdered and was still suffering the lingering effects.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>But that was hardly the point. The point was, at present, that Stane was trying to convince Tony they were only meant for war, ignoring the fact that Tony had suffered, intimately, because of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we do stops the world from falling into chaos.\u201d Stane was arguing, even as Tony shook his head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNot based on what I saw. We\u2019re not doing a good enough job - we can do better - we can do something else.\u201d And because Stane didn\u2019t see him as a threat - didn\u2019t see him as important - he didn\u2019t even try to hide the gleam in his eyes when Tony glanced away and up at the first version of the arc reactor. It had Harry\u2019s own narrowing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em>He knows</em>. He didn\u2019t know how he was so sure but he knew without a sliver of a doubt that Obadiah Stane was aware of the existence of the arc reactor in Tony\u2019s chest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOh, like what? You want us to make baby bottles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on.\u201d but the smirk was giving him away. \u201cThe arc reactor? That\u2019s a publicity stunt! Tony, come on, we built that thing to shut the hippies up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt works.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, as a science project.\u201d and he was circling Tony now, who was looking up at the larger version with pride in his eyes. Pride, Harry supposed, that came from doing the impossible. But all Harry could focus on was how Stane\u2019s circling reminded him of a shark. \u201cThe arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology,\u201d and even as the man spoke, Harry watched realization dawn in Tony\u2019s eyes. He too had caught on to the fact that the other man obviously already knew. \u201cIt\u2019s a dead end, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d but Tony kept his back to Obadiah.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, am I right? We haven\u2019t had a breakthrough in that in what, 30 years.\u201d and now Tony turned around, looking thoroughly unimpressed. He\u2019d obviously wanted to break the news himself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say.\u201d but he was watching Obadiah now, just as closely. Tony, however, wasn\u2019t being shy about his observations, for once. It told Harry one thing at least, he trusted Obadiah enough not to hide behind as many masks. \u201cCould you have a lousier poker face?\u201d Tony all but demanded, though he wasn\u2019t angry, just unable to keep silent. \u201cJust tell me, who told you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind who told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey.\u201d Tony interrupted, but Obadiah was no longer playing along quite as well, pointing towards Tony\u2019s chest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey or Pepper? It\u2019s Rhodey or Pepper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Rhodey.\u201d and even as Tony decided, already unbuttoning his shirt, the self satisfied smirk on Stane\u2019s face had a cold feeling rushing down Harry\u2019s spine.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>However Obadiah knew, it wasn\u2019t Rhodey or Pepper. And outside of Tony and Harry, and now Ron and Hermione, they were the only people who knew. As Harry knew it couldn\u2019t possibly have been Ron or Hermione, and it certainly wasn\u2019t Tony or himself, that didn\u2019t leave very many pleasant options. Keeping an eye on the pair in front of him, Harry pulled out the phone Tony had gifted him with, sending a text to Pepper.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>To Pepper Potts</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Something isn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t trust</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Obadiah Stane. He knows things<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>he shouldn\u2019t. Can you get to his<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>computer?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Pepper replied almost instantly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>From Pepper Potts</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m at the office. What<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n<em>do you </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>want me to do?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry was glad, at least, that Pepper trusted him enough to not ask too many questions yet. He figured she would, but at least for now she would do what he asked.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>To Pepper Potts</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>See if you can find any\u00a0</em>\n<em>new </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>projects.</em>\n</p>\n<p>There were no answers for a few minutes but when his phone vibrated with a text, the words were ominous.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>From Pepper Potts</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sector 16. I can\u2019t even<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n<em>get in.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry spent a few more minutes sending messages back and forth with her before he slipped his phone away, glancing at where Tony and the other man were still chatting. Since they\u2019d been practicing communicating without letting on that they were talking, Harry wasn\u2019t worried about reaching towards Tony\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to check. Are you alright here for the moment?\u201d</em> he asked, and the only thing that gave away that Tony had heard was the flicker of his gaze in Harry\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you back at the car in 5?\u201d</em> Tony asked, and Harry offered a quick nod before moving to the closest point out of sight. Then, twisting on the spot, he apparated away. He found Pepper waiting for him on the steps of a warehouse and Harry was impressed because the only outward sign of her surprise was a slight widening of her gaze.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThis is it then?\u201d he asked, ignoring her silent question, and she nodded, turning to face the door as well. Angling his body so she wouldn\u2019t see, he cast a quick, wandless <em>alohomora </em>and watched the door click open, satisfied. Then he turned to Pepper. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in with me, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find.\u201d because now that the door was open he could feel the buzz of residual magic and though it felt familiar, that didn\u2019t make it any less dangerous.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think it puts Tony\u2019s safety at risk?\u201d was what she asked instead, and Harry nodded. Her own, in turn, was brisk and determined. \u201cThen I\u2019m coming.\u201d Harry flashed her a bright grin but didn\u2019t argue. Instead, he lead the way inside.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take him long to find what exactly sector 16 was for - which made it immediately clear why he\u2019d felt residual magic. It was his own magic, and it was on pieces of the metal suit they\u2019d thought left behind in the desert.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d Pepper trailed off, eyes wide with horror, having heard the true story of the suit at least, minus the magic part. Harry nodded, expression grim.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I intend to find out.\u201d Before she could ask anymore questions, Harry spoke again, offering a reassuring smile. \u201cI want you to go back, now. Finish your day. We don\u2019t know anything for sure yet. Until we can prove it, I\u2019m not going to just accuse him.\u201d Pepper, who knew by now about Harry\u2019s affinity for the truth, nodded.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll tell me if you find anything.\u201d and it wasn\u2019t so much a question as an expectation. His smile widened.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sounding a bit more like him, you know.\u201d Pepper just smiled back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHazard of the job.\u201d but she still turned to leave as he\u2019d asked. When she was gone, Harry didn\u2019t bother to hide his magic.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cSomething came up.\u201d</em> he spoke into Tony\u2019s mind. <em>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the house.\u201d </em>And he knew he hadn\u2019t quite managed to keep his tone even if Tony\u2019s worry that filtered back along was anything to go by. But Harry didn\u2019t waste any time worrying about it. He had enough to worry about as it was. Instead, he grabbed onto the partially reassembled suit, and apparated back to the house.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony arrived home to find Harry brooding. He\u2019d known the other man had the propensity for a good brood considering his temper, but he\u2019d yet to see it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked, approaching slowly. He had no idea what might have set Harry off but something obviously had if his hasty retreat was anything to go off of - following that up by this obvious mood made it more than clear.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>At his question, Harry looked up, expression pinched.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I learned - it will upset you.\u201d Tony blinked, expression twisting into a frown.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s already upset you.\u201d He countered, but Harry shook his head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same. I don\u2019t have the same stake in this.\u201d He admitted. \u201cI\u2019m here for you. That\u2019s all that matters to me. But you - this is your home. These are the people you\u2019ve known most of your life.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m actually starting to worry about how selfless you are.\u201d Tony muttered, earning Harry\u2019s surprise. \u201cI\u2019m an extremely selfish person and at this rate it\u2019s going to be extremely unbalanced.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou may be able to mislead everyone else, but you\u2019re anything but selfish.\u201d And - what? Tony was so selfish - even with Harry\u2019s time and affection. Obviously noting his disbelief, Harry smirked. \u201cTony - you literally outfit all of your friends with the newest and coolest technology, all of which you make personally. You make sure the people who work for your company make a fair wage. You don\u2019t put up with stupidity because often that stupidity is because of laziness and you don\u2019t abide by that either. You have expensive tastes and an abrasive personality but those things are as much a product of how you were raised as how society chooses to view you. Plus, I enjoy both of those things about you. I don\u2019t have the foggiest about what it means to have such tastes so I enjoy experiencing it with you. And seeing as I\u2019m just as abrasive it just makes for a lot of honesty between us which in my opinion can never be a bad thing.\u201d Tony took a moment to absorb all of those words, not looking at Harry even as he felt the weight of his gaze, watching him. Then he shrugged, looking back with a smirk.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWell you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d And the response was so underwhelming that Harry burst into laughter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cRight then.\u201d One of his hands lifted in an almost abortive motion and since Tony couldn\u2019t have that he immediately made his way over and dropped down next to him, wrapping around him and earning another short laugh.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Tony murmured then, his forehead pressed to Harry\u2019s temple. He watched Harry close his eyes, turning his head ever so slightly but keeping the contact.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cRemember how upset you were about losing your first suit?\u201d Tony stiffened. \u201cI found it.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSector 16.\u201d He shrugged, knowing that wasn\u2019t really helpful. \u201cIt\u2019s taken up one of the southern warehouses.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d And there was anger in Tony\u2019s voice, but the tremor gave him away. Harry tightened his grip around the other man.</p>\n<p>\u201cStane already knew about your reactor.\u201d He admitted. \u201cI could see it in his eyes. It wasn\u2019t Rhodey or Pepper who told him but nobody else knows. So I texted Pepper to see if she could find anything odd. She found sector 16 but couldn\u2019t find what it meant. So I broke in.\u201d Tony had pulled back a little, searching his face, and then he felt the gentle brush of Tony\u2019s mind against his own. He nodded and watched Tony\u2019s eyes go slightly unfocused as he looked at Harry\u2019s memory of what happened himself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>When Tony\u2019s eyes focused again, they were filled with rage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d and Tony\u2019s voice was clipped, already laced with betrayal. Harry winced and some of the anger faded back as Tony frowned at him. \u201cYou suspect him too.\u201d and it was true so he didn\u2019t argue that, but -<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s practically your family.\u201d and Tony took his hand, grip strong.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We can choose our own family. He chose wrong.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t help himself then, he surged forward, pressing a chaste but no less passionate kiss to Tony\u2019s lips. When he pulled back, Tony was staring at him, eyes wide. Then the wicked glint entered them, smirk curling his lips. He started to lean forward and then caught himself, reaching out and catching Harry\u2019s chin in his hand instead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cLater. When we\u2019ve figured all this out.\u201d and the promise in his voice had Harry fighting back a shudder. It seemed Tony noticed anyways because his smirk widened and he leaned forward, stealing a kiss, though this one was less chaste. \u201cHmmm. Definitely later.\u201d and then he was on his feet, dragging Harry with him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s see how deep he\u2019s stuck his fingers in all the pies.\u201d Harry rolled his eyes. That was a terrible choice of metaphor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was worse than they\u2019d thought.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony stared with blank eyes as the video played once more - the video of him held captive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou did not tell us the one you wanted us to kill was Tony Stark.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry turned it off before it could play again, moving to stand between where Tony sat and the screen. He perched on the desk, reaching forward to cup Tony\u2019s face in his hands.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmured, \u201cYou with me?\u201d Tony gave a jerky nod, meeting Harry\u2019s gaze, but he looked lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wants me dead.\u201d Harry had to fight not to tighten his hold on Tony, not wanting to hurt him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou survived.\u201d and the steel entered Tony\u2019s gaze again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d Harry promised then, and Tony\u2019s whole body shuddered.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Harry\u2019s grin was all teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to obliterate him.\u201d He admitted, the rage almost vibrating through him. Tony leaned forward to press his face to Harry\u2019s stomach, wrapping his arms around him. One of Harry\u2019s arms curled around him in turn, the other hand snaking into Tony\u2019s hair. The touch had Tony letting out a heavy exhale.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI mean I wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d And Harry almost choked out a laugh, that vibrating rage sliding back as he all but curled around Tony protectively. Neither had any idea how long they actually stayed like that but when Harry finally uncurled and Tony tilted his face up to look at him, he saw electric green eyes filled with fire.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do about him?\u201d Tony opened his mouth to say he wanted him to suffer just as he had, but he found he couldn\u2019t. Because he didn\u2019t actually want anyone to experience that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI want him caught.\u201d Was what he finally decided on. Harry nodded, smoothing Tony\u2019s hair back with both hands. Tony found it both fascinating and impossibly hot to watch Harry visibly reign in his temper.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry finally verbalized, obviously back in control. \u201cLet me just get a few things and then why don\u2019t we catch him ourselves?\u201d And his grin was positively wicked. Tony couldn\u2019t help but mirror him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBetter dress for the occasion then.\u201d And Tony\u2019s mind was already flitting through his suits, deciding on which one would say the best \u2018fuck you\u2019.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cMeet you at the door in five.\u201d And then Harry disappeared. Tony grinned and raced for the stairs. He\u2019d only just made it to the top when the phone rang, and seeing Pepper\u2019s face he answered it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTony - I\u2019ve been trying to call you and Harry - Obadiah, he\u2019s insane. He attacked one of the scientists for losing the project-\u201d he heard the electric pulse moments before his whole body went still and panic screamed through him. He was lowered to the couch, phone removed from his hand and hung up even as Obie came into view.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Tony, you really ruined all my plans.\u201d The man complained amiably. \u201cFirst, you don\u2019t go and die like you\u2019re supposed to.\u201d He pulled a tool out of the bag Tony hadn\u2019t even seen and he was fairly certain if he wasn\u2019t paralyzed he\u2019d throw up. Obadiah was planning on taking the reactor right out of his chest. \u201cBut then - then you built that suit. And even better, you managed to harness the arc reactor technology in a useable format. When I got hold of the pieces of the suit, I realized it was just another opportunity you\u2019d given me.\u201d The tool extended, and Obadiah poised above him, lining it up with the arc reactor. Tony was starting to hyperventilate - or he would be if he could at least <em>breathe</em>. \u201cThen you had to go and ruin that too.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cActually, that was me.\u201d And between one moment and the next, Obadiah was sent flying, crashing into the far wall. Tony stared at Harry in all his furious glory, that impossible wind already starting to blow around the room, and was pretty sure he was in love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThe bodyguard?\u201d Obadiah demanded, but he was reaching behind his back and -</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of that now.\u201d Harry\u2019s expression was positively wolfish. With a wave of his hand, the gun Obadiah had been reaching for was sent flying across the room, and with a flick of his wand at Tony the genius was able to gasp for breath, hand coming up to clasp at his chest. But he didn\u2019t look away from Harry, not wanting to miss a second. \u201cYou know, the assumption that I was just his bodyguard was surprisingly useful. For one, it hid what he really means to me.\u201d With an imperious flick of a wrist, his sleeve shifted, revealing his soul mark, and Tony grinned. Whoever said <em>he</em> was the drama queen had clearly never met Harry. Harry who was staring at Obadiah like he\u2019d just brought Christmas.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony\u2019s a kindhearted soul and just wanted you caught - but you hurt <em>my soulmate</em>. And not once, but <em>twice</em>. If you retain any of this, I hope it\u2019s that you\u2019re only alive through his kindness.\u201d Then he pointed his wand at Obadiah. He looked at Tony then, who was watching the whole thing in fascination. Realizing that Harry wouldn\u2019t act without his okay, he nodded. Harry\u2019s grin would have been terrifying if Tony hadn\u2019t known beyond a doubt at this point that Harry would never hurt him. Harry turned back to Obadiah and it seemed even the older man had realized that Harry was the most dangerous thing he\u2019d ever faced because sweat was beading on his brow. He opened his mouth - probably to try and bargain, but Harry didn\u2019t give him a chance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Obliviate</em>.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was anticlimactic.\u201d Tony noted as he followed Harry who was levitating Obadiah, unconscious, out the front door. They were waiting for the authorities and Harry was loathe to let them in the house right now. In response, Harry shrugged, a what-can-you-do gesture. Tony had obviously spoken too soon.</p>\n<p>Four loud cracks filled the air and Tony immediately found his vision blocked by Harry\u2019s form, wand in hand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cGet back in the house.\u201d Harry ordered, but Tony just inched closer to him. Before Harry could berate him further, the four wizards who\u2019d appeared actually seemed to stand down.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony could honestly say he\u2019d never expected <em>this</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Of all the outcomes of the apparently magical police showing up on his doorstep, he\u2019d never assumed they would\u2019ve actually stopped in their tracks at the sight of Harry. Of Harry who\u2019s expression had gone cold and distant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I know you.\u201d And his voice was as cold as his expression. The wizard actually looked bashful, flush covering his cheeks. The others were looking at Harry with varying expressions of disbelief.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNo - no. Of course not. Auror Giles. It\u2019s such an honour to meet you.\u201d Tony was staring at Harry; at how his jaw was clenched, and he looked both furious and suddenly exhausted.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cPleasure.\u201d Harry replied, polite but cool.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWe - we were here because magic was performed in the presence of muggle - uh - against a muggle.\u201d And all eyes except Harry\u2019s moved to look at Obadiah. Harry drew himself up, and he was the same force of nature Tony had first seen in the desert.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHe attacked my soulmate.\u201d And there was a hard edge to his voice - a grip on his wand that said he wouldn\u2019t back down from this. Tony felt all eyes fall on him now and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever feel this way again - invisible behind someone else\u2019s shadow. \u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d And he all but jumped at the whip of Harry\u2019s voice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cUm-\u201d one of them began, but Harry\u2019s lips curled in a sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Tony Stark. Please tell me at least one of you is aware of muggle culture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a genius inventor!\u201d One of the younger aurors piped up, obviously excited, and Harry actually relaxed a little at the words, offering the young woman a smile.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYes. He is. And so I\u2019m sure you remember that he spent some time overseas recently.\u201d She nodded, though the others obviously weren\u2019t quite sure where this was going. \u201cThis man is responsible for that.\u201d Harry\u2019s smile grew sharp. \u201cThen he tried again here, in our home. And he tried to pull a gun on me.\u201d The outrage from the others was immediate. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can understand then, why I had no choice. As soulmates are exempt from the statute there should be no problem really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Lord Potter.\u201d One of the other two auror\u2019s agreed, having kept silent until that moment. It was only because Tony spent a lot of time looking at Harry that he noticed the slight flinch at being addressed like that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I can trust the four of you to be discreet.\u201d And there was no missing the threat in Harry\u2019s voice, in how the air all but crackled around them at his thinning patience. \u201cMy home here is private.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>There were rounds of agreement before the aurors gathered Obadiah and disappeared just as they came.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The moment they were gone, Harry slumped, and when Tony reached out to help support his weight, he was surprised by the electric jolt he received.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Harry apologized immediately, though he didn\u2019t pull away. Instead, he did what Tony usually did and turned to drape all over the billionaire, pressing his face against the other man\u2019s neck.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Tony soothed, though he wasn\u2019t really sure it was. What the hell had just happened?</p>\n<p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d been planning on telling you I was famous too.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBut you said you didn\u2019t know how to handle this sort of thing.\u201d The fame, the money, etc. Harry bodily flinched against him and it had Tony holding him tighter, dragging him back inside. \u201cJarvis, lock it down. Get ahold of Ron or Hermione. We need to make sure those wards are all up and working. We don\u2019t need anymore guests.\u201d And then he hauled Harry to the bedroom. There, he tucked the other man in as he\u2019d often done for him - making sure he was as comfortable as he could be before crawling in next to him and drawing him in. He felt the brush of Harry\u2019s mind against his, felt the sharp, jagged pain Harry was feeling and immediately reached back to try and soothe.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He understood not wanting to verbalize certain things.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Watch</em>.\u201d Was the soft direction, and then it was like a memory reel.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tony found himself cradling a cup of coffee in the kitchen, staring into the steam. Harry was fast asleep, tear tracks dried on his cheeks, and Tony felt wrecked.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He understood now why Harry was so protective of him - why he was so aggressive when it came to either of them being under anyone else\u2019s power. He understood why Harry held the family he\u2019d chosen in such high regard when the family he\u2019d been given had treated him so hideously. Tony may have had a really shit relationship with his father - but at the end of the day he was well aware that his father was proud of what he accomplished, even when he\u2019d had a hard time showing it. That it was his pride of being the best that had been hurt when Tony had succeeded so quickly, but that it had never meant his father hated him - just that he didn\u2019t know how to treat him properly. And his mother - well his mother had adored him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t help but think of how small Harry had looked in some of the memories - how he\u2019d been too skinny - and that <em>cupboard</em> -<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The mug in his hands shattered and he cursed, jumping back, cursing viciously.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSir-\u201d Jarvis made to interrupt, but Tony waved him off.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care unless Ron and Hermione are here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He spun to see the two in the doorway, watching him. With a wave of Hermione\u2019s wand, the mug repaired itself and a second wave had the coffee spill cleaned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d And then he remembered just why he\u2019d wanted them here. \u201cHarry told me everything.\u201d There was a single shocked moment before Hermione\u2019s expression crumpled and then she was hugging him tightly and normally he was pretty sure if anyone else had done that he would\u2019ve panicked - but he\u2019d just watched these people help Harry through all that shit and he hugged her back just as tight. When she pulled back, she cupped his face in her hands, and it reminded him so much of his mother that it ached.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad he told you.\u201d She murmured, tilting his face forward to press the sweetest kiss to his forehead. Then she guided him back to sit, she and Ron sitting at the table with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he tell you or did he show you?\u201d Ron asked when they were comfortable.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe showed me his memories.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cSo you know the thing that will help him most is not treating him any differently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically I\u2019m still more famous.\u201d Tony said with a smirk he didn\u2019t feel. Hermione obviously understood because she squeezed his hand and Ron gave a humourless smile. There was a moment of silence before Tony huffed out a breath, shoving away from the table. He was just itching for a fight. \u201cWhat can we even do?\u201d He demanded, hands raking through his hair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAll we can do is be there.\u201d Hermione said gently, though a fire simmered in her gaze. This was something they\u2019d been dealing with for much longer, but it didn\u2019t make it any easier for Tony. Tony who shook his head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough.\u201d And even as he said it, he knew it was true. A plan was forming and it was giving him purpose. He nodded, decided, and looked at the two other people who knew his soulmate best. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry woke up feeling groggy and disoriented. Then he remembered the evening before and groaned, burying his head in his pillow, pulling the covers up over his head. He 100% had not meant to dump the entirety of his shitty life on Tony, but it seemed he\u2019d done just that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He muttered into the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you ask really nicely.\u201d Came Tony\u2019s voice in reply, and Harry shot up in surprise, spinning around to see the billionaire watching him from the doorway, arms crossed over his chest and a smirk on his features. He sauntered over then, coming right over to Harry and kissing him before Harry could even think twice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Though he\u2019d known better, Harry hadn\u2019t been able to help himself from thinking that Tony might walk away when he knew the truth, and the fact that he was still here - still <em>wanted</em> him - just blew him away. He all but whimpered into the kiss when Tony didn\u2019t immediately pull away that only seemed to spur the genius on. When he finally pulled back, Harry felt punch drunk and couldn\u2019t help but chase Tony\u2019s lips with his own. It earned him a huff of laughter and when he opened his eyes Tony was watching him fondly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to get dressed. Wear something real nice. Jarvis has a couple of suggestions for you. I\u2019ve got somewhere I need to be and I want you to come with me.\u201d He leaned forward to kiss him one last time before he left Harry to get ready, and that\u2019s when Harry realized Tony was already impeccably dressed.</p>\n<p>He dragged himself out of bed and towards the closet, not wanting to disappoint Tony despite how his stomach was churning with dread.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cJarvis?\u201d He all but pleaded, and the AI obviously sympathized because the lights immediately pointed at a specific suit option and he sighed in relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d And Harry wasn\u2019t sure if he was imagining the fondness or not.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Once he was dressed, he made his way out of the bedroom, trying to force some semblance of order to his hair as he looked for Tony.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry, you look wonderful!\u201d The sound of Hermione\u2019s voice had his head shooting up and he felt some of the tension in his shoulders loosen at the sight of her.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHermione.\u201d And then she was there, hugging him tight, and he clung back. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He asked even as he caught sight of Ron as the taller man came forward to grab him in a hug of his own.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI called them.\u201d Tony said then, coming forward to slide an arm around Harry, dropping a careless kiss to his cheek. \u201cUnited front and all that. You ready?\u201d And Harry was beginning to realize that all three of them knew something he didn\u2019t.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cReady for what exactly?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d Tony asked instead of answering, and Harry answered without hesitation.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony beamed at him before sliding his sunglasses on, and Harry recognized that he was slipping into his public persona because his bright smile became more of a smirk and the arm around him became more of a guiding hand on his back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, cars our front.\u201d Then he nodded at Ron and Hermione who didn\u2019t move to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t they coming?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be there.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t really an answer. Harry considered pushing for details, but then he realized that it didn\u2019t much matter. He really did trust Tony, and the best way to show it would be to stop asking so many questions.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything you want me to know?\u201d And Tony\u2019s smile became a touch more genuine for a moment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. I promise it\u2019ll all make sense soon.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they pulled up to the same building Tony had held his press conference in when he\u2019d announced the change of direction of Stark Industries, Harry\u2019s nerves came back full force. Pepper was waiting for them now and she offered them both a smile.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cReady, Mr. Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely, Miss Potts. Will you escort Harry to his seat?\u201d And she nodded, turning to Harry. Harry immediately offered his arm which she accepted with a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to sit together on this one.\u201d She promised. Harry was relieved to know that at least. She obviously noticed because she rolled her eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you anything, did he?\u201d He shook his head but Pepper just smiled and didn\u2019t say another word as she lead him in.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The murmurs started as soon as they appeared, because by now they were both familiar faces to the press though more in the background than anything else. Their appearance, however, meant that Tony Stark wasn\u2019t far behind.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>On cue, Tony stepped on to the stage and up to the podium, patented smirk in place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all probably wondering why you\u2019re here.\u201d He said easily. \u201cLast time we were all in the same room I made an announcement that created global change. I\u2019d like to think for the better.\u201d There was a round of chuckles.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Tony pulled off his sunglasses and the reaction was immediate. The murmurs started up again, curious and alarmed, knowing it had to be something big. Tony Stark was never one to make these things more personal - and that\u2019s what he\u2019d done by removing the glasses, he\u2019d removed part of that persona.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to announce that I\u2019m here for something far more personal.\u201d The reaction was immediate, reporters barely stopped themselves from surging to their feet to start peppering him with questions. Tony put up a hand for quiet and the room immediately fell into an uneasy silence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Harry was just staring - he had no idea how to react. Tony looked right at him, gaze earnest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to announce I\u2019ve found my soulmate.\u201d The room erupted, but Tony kept on, tone even, forcing the reporters to stay quieter if they wanted to hear him. \u201cI found him - or well - he found me - and the rumours are true - he does complete me.\u201d He went quiet then, letting the questions rush forward, waited for them to quiet down once more when it became clear he wouldn\u2019t answer right off. When the room had settled once more, Tony waved a hand towards one reporter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cWho is he? What\u2019s his name?\u201d Tony\u2019s smirk was back, and he looked at Harry, lifting a brow. Harry nodded, dumbfounded, because why the hell not. He was too in shock to react otherwise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHis name is Harry Potter and most of you thought he was just a bodyguard. Truth is, he\u2019s the love of my life and I want everyone to know it.\u201d And with that smug admittance, he stepped away from the podium.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Pepper already had Harry out of his seat and was guiding him out before anyone could start to question them. As soon as they were in private, Pepper rounded on him, concerned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d He asked instead of answering, and Pepper nodded. Harry gave a near hysterical laugh.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>He felt the moment Tony entered the room - his entire body already hyper aware. When he turned, Tony looked worried.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Tony asked, and Harry realized he must look quite a fright if they were both asking. He reached a hand up to his cheek and realized it was wet with tears. Startled, he jerked his hand back, looking at the tears on his fingertips and realizing he <em>was</em> a bit of a mess. But then Tony was right in front of him and Harry didn\u2019t know how to tell him just what it meant to him so instead he yanked the other man closer in a searing kiss, pushing just how much he loved this man more than absolutely anything else in the world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>When they finally broke apart, Pepper was nowhere to be found and they were grinning like idiots.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want the whole world to know what you are to me.\u201d Tony told him then, fierce as anything. Harry realized he hadn\u2019t been wrong to think his soulmate was a Gryffindor through and through. \u201cYou\u2019re the luckiest thing that could have ever happened to me. And those - those <em>people\u2014</em>\u201d he refused to refer to the Dursley\u2019s as family. \u201cI want them to know that their loss was my gain. I want everyone to know. You\u2019re mine and I\u2019m yours and I don\u2019t care if I have to put it on every billboard in the city.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Harry choked on a laugh, shaking his head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary.\u201d Harry told him, holding tight. Tony\u2019s expression grew skeptical.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it might be. I don\u2019t care what anyone else told me. You\u2019re the best part of my life and I\u2019m not going to stop until you believe it too.\u201d Harry shook his head but Tony counted his smile as a win.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Then Harry tilted his head, thoughtful.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get Ron and Hermione in on this?\u201d Tony\u2019s response was just to grin, taking Harry\u2019s hand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u201cTake us home?\u201d And Harry didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever be able to deny Tony that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>With a twist, he took them home.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>"
