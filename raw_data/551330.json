  "summary": "<p>Charlie is back in all her glory. The Winchesters have showed up on her doorstep and she\u2019s making the best of it the only way she knows how. By being the little sister Dean never wanted and shipping the shit out of Destiel.</p>\n<p>Charlie drags Sam headfirst into plotting to make Destiel as canon as she possibly can - despite his protests because Sam <em>really</em> doesn't want to talk about who his brother is sexing up, he just wants Dean and Cas to be happy.</p>\n<p>Charlie would throttle Sam if she could. But there's an Angel of the Lord sitting in front of her and he just <em>might</em> frown upon that. As queen of her high school improv group, Charlie throws those skills to good use and decides to take a page out of Team Free Will's handbook (she'll make it up as she goes along and keep her fingers crossed that Dean or Cas doesn't mess this up).</p>\n<p>With Castiel in on the scheming now, things aren't actually looking as up as Charlie was hoping they would. If he would just <em>pick</em> one of their plans, he and Dean would probably be getting on with the happy make-outs by now. Charlie makes the decision for everyone and Sam feels more uncomfortable than he likely thought possible.</p>\n<p>The plan might have been doomed the moment they walked in the door, but Charlie swore she'd see this through to the end. She just hadn't anticipated Dean Winchester. And if she was being honest? She had <em>definitely</em> overestimated angelic patience.</p>\n<p>Charlie and Sam's hard work comes to fruition in this extra. Dean and Castiel put a big black 'X' through the UST in their relationship and even manage to solve a few lingering doubts in the process.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>I\u2019ve only watched Season 7 once and that was a month or more ago. I adore Charlie, but I probably didn\u2019t capture her properly since I am not even on the same scale of awesome. But I gave it a go and we ended up with this because certain people (cough<a href=\"https://freckledbuttchester.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">freckledbuttchester</a>cough) put plot-bunnies in my head and all blame falls in that direction.</p>\n<p>This was just supposed to be a one shot. Then people asked for more and the plot-bunnies multiplied and now it's going to be four parts (or three - because I can't decide if I wanna make a smutty chapter at the end or not). So I blame you guys for this. I really really do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p> <strong>SEASON EIGHT SPOILERS</strong></p>\n<p>This was supposed to be the last chapter.</p>\n<p>But then the plot bunnies got promiscuous and now I honestly don't know how many chapters there will be. I'm having too much fun with this story to really care at this point. These pages are basically writing themselves now.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DEFINITE SEASON EIGHT SPOILERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I'm thinking this is likely the 2nd to last chapter. The next will wrap the story up and... well. I'm <em>thinking</em> about a smutty little chapter afterward. I'm not sure. What do you guys think? Is that something you'd want?</p>\n<p>This is the last chapter. But there <em>will</em> be one little smutty 'extra' uploaded next week. </p>\n<p>I just want to thank everyone so much for reading. To everyone who took the time to comment and drop a kudos on this story, <em>thank you</em>. I wasn't expecting anything like this when I started this story (dude, it was supposed to be a <em>oneshot</em>). And I'm just overwhelmed by your kindness. Truly, thank you. </p>\n<p>I hope you'll stick around for more stories. Thank you again. \u2665</p>\n<p>I tried writing this in the past tense like I did with the previous chapters. But it just came out <em>wrong</em>. So... I'm sorry about the tense shift, but this is written in the present and it's all from Castiel's point of view.</p>\n<p>It's also the first time I've written smut in over a year and somehow this ended up longer than any of the previous chapters and there's a bit of a plot in there, if you look hard enough. Maybe. I dunno. There's certainly more than I ever thought was going to be in this. </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Thank you to everyone who's read, commented, kudos-ed, bookmarked, and subscribed to this story. Your kindness and encouragement was more than I was ever expecting and I pretty much cried every time. Thank you so much and if you plan to stick around to read anything else I post, I hope I don't disappoint you.</strong>\n</p>",
  "text": "<p>Charlie was a cool kind of girl. When shit hit the fan, she tucked and rolled and dealt with it like the best of them. So when Sam and Dean Winchester showed up on her door step well over a year since they sent her off on that bus, she simply shrugged, stepped aside and gestured widely for them to come in.</p>\n<p>Now the pair were seated at opposite ends of her couch, beers in hand while she fiddled with her temperamental oven to try and get it to warm up enough to cook a couple of frozen pizzas \u2013 one vegetarian and one meat-lovers, supplied by the hunters in her living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with those Leviathan-things again, does it?\u201d She called from the kitchen, \u201cDick Roman went MIA a while ago \u2013 it was all over the news \u2013 so I kinda figured you two iced the bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Dean grunted, \u201cAnd it got my ass sent to Purgatory for a year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She poked her head out of the kitchen, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d Sam shifted.</p>\n<p>Both brothers looked uncomfortable and she let the topic drop, \u201cSo what brings you boys to my neck of the woods? Got some major corporations you want me to crack into? Or some fake IDs made? I\u2019m a pro at those, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we kinda did. Lizzie Walker, was it?\u201d Dean smirked, raising an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can still call me Charlie. I liked that one better - though that <em>was</em> a few aliases ago.\u201d Charlie paused, nails picking at the folds of the pizza box, \u201cHow <em>did</em> you find me anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam and Dean shared a little grin. Dean took a swig of his beer and Sam turned his secretive little smile on Charlie, \u201cWe\u2019ve got our own little blood hound. He\u2019s really good at finding people when we need them to be found.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI covered my tracks pretty damn well. How\u2019d he find me? He some kind of elitist hacker working for the government or something? I wouldn\u2019t put it past you two to have someone on the inside now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean almost sprayed his mouthful of beer across her coffee table. She frowned at him as he struggled through a mutant hybrid of coughing and laughing and muttering something about \u2018holy tax accountants\u2019 and \u2018technologically challenged\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say something funny?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. He\u2019s just being a jerk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBitch.\u201d Dean coughed back and shot his brother a glare.</p>\n<p>Charlie fixed a wicked grin in place, \u201cI can see why the fandom ships you two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both of them turned mirror versions of the same mix of disgust and horror to her. Charlie was mildly surprised that they knew what she was talking about, but she cranked her grin up a few notches wider and ripped the edge off the pizza box with a flourish, turning back into the kitchen as she did so. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you really think I wouldn\u2019t try googling you guys? Low and behold there\u2019s a whole <em>book series</em> about you two! And the fandom? Whoa, nellie. They are <em>devoted</em> to their ships. And all that homoerotic subtext was just crying for a ship or two, or three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean grumbled incoherent obscenities and slouched deeper into the couch to take an ever longer drought from his beer.</p>\n<p>Sam shuddered and rubbed a hand through his hair, \u201cAt least Chuck stopped publishing before he put out any books with Castiel in them. \u2018Pretty boy angels\u2019 would have sent the fandom into hysterics, and with all the staring you two do and your \u2018profound bond\u2019-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSammy!\u201d Dean hissed the same moment Charlie practically barreled out of the kitchen and all but threw herself across the living room to sink into the space between them to ask - almost too gleefully - \u201cWho\u2019s Castiel?\u201d with wide, excited eyes and leaning well into Sam\u2019s personal bubble.</p>\n<p>He stared at her for several seconds before his eyes slid up from her face and to Dean. Charlie could feel the heat from Dean\u2019s glare on the back of her head and she whipped around, leaning against him. She schooled her features into the picture of serene seriousness and asked, \u201cIs he your boooooyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean choked on air and his face went three shades of red before Charlie jumped up, giggling, \u201cDon\u2019t get your panties-\u201d He turned another two shades darker and that almost made her stop to make inquiries but hey, who was she to judge? \u201c- in a twist. I\u2019m just teasing!\u201d She stepped on and over the coffee table and slid back into the kitchen to snag another few beers from the fridge.</p>\n<p>Sam caught his and Dean nearly took his to the crotch when she tossed them. Leaning against the doorframe to keep an eye on the stove timer, she tilted her head again, \u201cBut seriously, angels? I don\u2019t remember you mentioning them the last time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s expression hardened and he fixed his eyes on her massive computer set up (for lack of anything else to stare at in the room) and Charlie\u2019s pretty sure her computer would be toast if he was secretly the X-men\u2019s Cyclops. The guy sure could stare intently at stuff. He downed half his freshly opened beer without a word while Sam shot him nervous little glances. </p>\n<p>\u201cCas was kind of\u2026 out of commission-\u201d He didn\u2019t flinch when Dean glared at him, but it\u2019s a near thing, \u201c- when we met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe better now though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d Sam shrugged.</p>\n<p>Charlie sipped at her beer, \u201cSo\u2026 angel. How\u2019s that work?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink Superman with invisible wings, epic smiting powers, and a tan trench coat.\u201d Sam shrugged again, \u201cLots of bright lights and sudden entrances. His mojo lets him pop wherever the heck he wants to pop \u2013 as long as he knows where we are first. We used to just call him on a cell phone, but now we just say a prayer and he pops in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean lifted a finger off his beer bottle and pointed it at her threatening before Charlie even got the chance to slip on a sly face, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDare what?\u201d She raised an eyebrow, donning the wide-eyed innocent look she was oh so good at, \u201cDon\u2019t dare to say something like\u2026 \u2018Dear Castiel, angel in a trench coat, this is Charlie \u2013 friend of Dean and Sam \u2013 and we would really, <em>really</em> like it if you would join us for beer and pizza while we discussed the reason the Winchesters decided to drop in on me unannounced. Please.\u2019 That sound about right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean pressed his lips into a thin line and Charlie felt a little thrill of fear go down her spine at the positively venomous look. She might have commented on it or casually slipped back into the kitchen so Sam could deflate his big bro before Dean brought down his own particular brand of wrath on her head, but Charlie found herself very distracted by sound of fluttering feathers and the new addition to the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for inviting me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be Castiel! Or do you prefer \u2018Cas\u2019?\u201d She smiled brightly, \u201cNice to meet\u2019cha. Would you like a beer?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded, \u201cYou as well. Cas is fine, and yes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean was looking pointedly at the computer again, but Charlie didn\u2019t miss that the tension was slowly easing from his shoulders or how he grunted a quiet \u2018Hey Cas\u2019 under his breath and was answered with a soft \u2018Hello Dean\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cGlad you could join us, Cas!\u201d Sam smiled and the angel tipped his head at him in acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>Castiel accepted the offered beer, \u201cThere was nothing better to do and I was contemplating calling to see if there was anything I could help with.\u201d He tilted his head and looked to Dean, \u201cAre you on a hunt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie was really enjoying this. Like, she was really, really enjoying this because Dean was clearly fighting the urge to look at Castiel. Fighting and failing so hard that his eyes were already sliding across the room until he was looking at the angel. Sam raised his eyebrows at Charlie in a <em>\u2018You see what I mean? This is the shit I have to deal with\u2019</em> look.</p>\n<p>She rolled her lips under her teeth and tried very, very hard not to laugh. Laughing would interrupt the very in depth, very intense conversation Dean and Castiel were having about some kind of coven of witches using their witchy wiles to run banking scams of some sort (thus why Charlie and her epic technological prowess were needed because hacking banks was something Sam and his decidedly less-epic prowess could not do). And the whole conversation was going on <em>without breaking eye contact.</em></p>\n<p>This right here was one of those precious moments in a fandom when you know what\u2019s happening. When you can see it taking place before your very eyes. That magical, special moment. <em>The forming of an OTP.</em></p>\n<p>She was grinning like a maniac and she knew it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, can you do it or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie snapped to attention, \u201cSorry what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean frowned at her and his narrowed eyes were probably because he knew exactly what she\u2019d been thinking, \u201cCan you hack a bank?\u201d</p>\n<p>She scoffed, flicking her hair over her shoulder as she crossed the room to her computer, \u201cCan Malcolm Reynolds rock a floral bonnet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her statement was met with silence and she spun the chair around to look at them. Sam and Dean were both kind of shaking, obviously trying to keep from laughing but Castiel was regarding her with his eyebrows drawn together in a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that reference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam snorted and Dean full on chuckled, slinging an arm across the back of the couch (conveniently located right behind Castiel\u2019s shoulders) and he kind of looked torn between wanting to explain it, wanting to dig out Charlie\u2019s Firefly DVDs for a marathon so Castiel could just witness it, or just letting the moment slide. Castiel looked somewhat pleased that Dean was laughing.</p>\n<p>Charlie really couldn\u2019t help her own grin or the words that slipped out the moment Dean tilted his head back to take another sip from his bottle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I ship it.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, the coffee table was not spared the spray of beer.</p>\n<p>Castiel spent the next thirty minutes pouting in the arm chair and chewing absently on a piece of pizza because Dean refused to explain what Charlie meant <em>(\u201cBut Dean what do boats have to do with anything we were just talking about?\u201d)</em>. He had told her, on threat of bodily harm, that if she said another word on it he\u2019d show her all the other shit he could do as a hunter. In the up close and personal kind of way.</p>\n<p>Sam couldn\u2019t stop laughing long enough to say anything when Cas had turned his confused eyes to him. When he was done, Sam ended up laying flat on the floor where he had slipped sometime during the ridiculous fit that no one seemed willing to try and pull him out of (Charlie got the feeling that the brothers didn\u2019t laugh a whole lot \u2013 judging from Dean\u2019s exasperated look that practically teemed with fondness). She had relocated to the floor with her laptop on the freshly cleaned coffee table.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God, could you imagine if Becky found out?\u201d Sam wheezed and Dean looked terrified at the thought \u2013 so scared that Castiel actually sat forward in concern and Sam had to wave him down with the assurance that it was nothing to be worried about.</p>\n<p>Charlie lifted her fingers from the keyboard and looked between the brothers, \u201cWho\u2019s Becky?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSammy\u2019s biggest fangirl.\u201d Dean supplied quickly \u2013 obviously in retaliation \u2013 before Sam could say anything. He was stretched out on the couch (and Charlie hadn\u2019t failed to notice that he was sitting at the perfect angle to be able to see Castiel) and looking entirely too pleased when Sam gave a full body shudder, \u201cAnd his ex-wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDean!\u201d The look Sam sent him was positively <em>scandalized</em> and Charlie jotted a quick reminder on a sticky-note to look up that particularly juicy bit of information because marriage records were actually really easy to find.</p>\n<p>Castiel leaned forward, fixing Sam with a look that Charlie was seriously impressed with. He somehow managed to keep a perfectly straight face while coming across as both disappointed and hurt that this information had been kept from him, \u201cYou never said you were married!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em>drugged</em> with a <em>love potion!</em>\u201d Sam slapped his hands over his face and rolled on his side away from Castiel, \u201cIt\u2019s a time of my life we\u2019re trying really hard to forget, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie wisely kept her mouth shut. This was infinitely more entertaining than hacking into the bank accounts of some wall-street-witches who happened to be scarily good at making it look like witchcraft <em>wasn\u2019t</em> behind their ridiculously good luck with the stock market. Which seemed par for the course really. If witchcraft was an obvious thing, than wouldn\u2019t more people be using it?</p>\n<p>And hacking like this took talent and focus and Charlie was only human, how the hell was she supposed to pay attention to running her programs and code when so much beautiful <em>drama</em> was unfolding right here in her very own living room? Hell, she should be recording this for the fandom and sharing this glorious bounty with everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw lighten up, Sammy. Cas is just disappointed he wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. Aren\u2019t ya, Cas?\u201d Dean teased.</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s comeback cut Castiel off before he could agree, \u201cA little hard to invite someone we thought was <em>dead</em>, Dean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even Charlie winced at that.</p>\n<p>The bottom of Dean\u2019s beer bottle hit the coffee table a little too hard for Charlie\u2019s taste, but her glare died before she could even get it revved up. If this was anime, she\u2019s pretty sure half of Dean\u2019s face would be covered in shadow. Sam was staring through his fingers like he was scared if he moved his hands he was going to combust from the blank-but-seriously-scary expression Dean was sporting.</p>\n<p>Charlie chanced a look at Castiel and found him with much the same look only it was disturbingly filled with guilt and now she knows there\u2019s a whole back story to this conversation. A back story that she\u2019s just itching to ask about, that she probably won\u2019t find on the internet, and might actually get her shanked by Dean if she asked about it.</p>\n<p>It almost seemed worth it. Almost.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s ashamed to admit that she kind of flinched when Dean suddenly got to his feet. Even Sam sat up a little warily, eyeing Dean like he expected a good swift stomp to the nuts. Castiel lifted his head slightly and Charlie melted a little inside because if that isn\u2019t the most endearingly <em>adorable</em> kicked-puppy look, she doesn\u2019t know what is.</p>\n<p>Dean grabbed his jacket, shrugging it on without looking at any of them, \u201cI\u2019m going to go get us more beer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDean \u2013\u201d Cas started quietly, half rising from the chair but the door was already slamming shut. He sat down slowly.</p>\n<p>Sam sighed and Charlie kinda had to give the guy props. For being a million feet tall, he had a pretty good kicked-puppy look too.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Cas. I didn\u2019t mean to bring that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware he was still upset about it \u2013 or rather, was ever upset about it.\u201d Castiel slouched in his seat, looking far more dejected than any angel of the lord should look (in Charlie\u2019s fine opinion). He hesitated only a moment before adding, \u201cI would have returned to the both of you immediately if I had been able to remember anything. You know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do, and Dean probably does too. But you know him, he\u2019s kind of\u2026\u201d Sam gestured vaguely and Charlie interpreted it as <em>\u2018emotionally-constipated-but-he\u2019s-making-progress\u2019.</em></p>\n<p>And that, well that just set off all kinds of little ideas firing in her synapses. Charlie tented her fingertips in front of her lips, resting her elbows on the coffee table, and tried her best to keep her face in serious-mode, \u201cYou should go talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wow. Apparently even angels can pull off a pretty decent <em>\u2018are we even talking about the same thing here, keep with the frikken program\u2019</em> look. Although it was scarily similar to Sam\u2019s, and if Charlie was even close to being right about the history between these three, then it\u2019s really possible that Cas actually learned that look from Sam.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, he doesn\u2019t talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t do \u2018chick-flick\u2019 moments.\u201d Castiel muttered, air-quotes and all.</p>\n<p>She raised an eyebrow and frowned, \u201cAre you sure? I mean, how accurate are the Supernatural books? Because seriously, you guys have more chick-flick moments in your lives than I do. They might not all be touchy-feely, Leia-to-Han \u2018someone who loves you\u2019 moments, but they <em>are</em> pretty chick-flicky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh and if Castiel thought she missed that little twitch during her quote, he is sorely mistaken. She files away <em>that</em> little bit for future reference. Charlie has more to say, she really does, but Castiel suddenly goes all stiff and weird like a statue and tilted his head as if he\u2019s listening to something far away.</p>\n<p>Sam noticed too and he gets much more serious, \u201cAngel radio?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel didn\u2019t answer right away. For several moments he sat there with a faraway look in his eyes and Charlie was getting seriously uncomfortable because the angel was barely breathing and holy crap did her little attempt at match-making just kill him? Is that what it took to kill an angel? That would just be really stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to go.\u201d Castiel was on his feet faster than Charlie could register and she blinked in surprise because he suddenly wasn\u2019t there anymore. The clinking of dishes in the kitchen had her whipping around to see Castiel putting his dish and empty beer bottle in the sink and he looked over his shoulder to her and Sam \u2013 who was leaning dangerously far over to see around the doorframe. \u201cIf Dean returns before I do, please let him know I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then there was the beating of wings and the papers on her fridge fluttered against their magnets. This time, Castiel was actually gone. Charlie turned back to her screen slowly, frowning lightly at the running program and the flickering numbers. She looked to Sam and he seemed much more accepting of Castiel\u2019s vanishing act, so she assumed it must happen a lot.</p>\n<p>Rather than ask about it, Charlie decided to take the bull by the horns and address the oliphaunt in the room. \u201cThey\u2019re so into eachother it hurts to look at with all that UST.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam paused in his ungainly climb back onto the couch, \u201cUST?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnresolved Sexual Tension.\u201d</p>\n<p>He made a face and stretched out, his long legs taking up the whole couch despite how he was still sitting upright, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want that image in my head, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you agree, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t.\u201d Sam pointedly did not look at Charlie or the ridiculous grin she knew was painted all over her face, \u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s kind of getting intolerable. You should have seen them when Cas came back from Purgatory \u2013 which was a few months after Dean did \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Charlie shuffled onto her knees, planting her hands on the coffee table and leaning over it, \u201cAre you saying they were in Purgatory <em>together</em> for a whole <em>year?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam was again making with the whole \u2018no eye contact\u2019 thing and Charlie was half tempted to plant herself in his lap and force him to look at her during this conversation, \u201cYeah, they were. I don\u2019t\u2026 actually know what happened there. Just that it was rough for the both of them and neither really likes to talk about it. And Benny didn\u2019t offer to share anything either.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence for a tick and then Sam visibly winced. Charlie was practically kneeling on the table now because that right there was a ridiculously delicious piece of information that Sam really probably shouldn\u2019t have mentioned and if Dean was here Charlie was ninety-five percent sure one or both of them would be bleeding.</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t keep the sing-song out of her voice even if she wanted to, \u201cWho\u2019s Beeeeeenny?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam pursed his lips and turned his eyes up to the ceiling, \u201cNo one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother angel?\u201d</p>\n<p>He snorted, \u201cHell no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA demon? Leviathan? Shape-shifter? Skin-walker? Werewolf? Vampi \u2013 ah-hah!\u201d She pointed dramatically because Sam\u2019s lips had thinned out even more at that last one, \u201cSo he\u2019s a vampire!\u201d Which really didn\u2019t make sense because, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys hunters? Don\u2019t you <em>kill</em> vampires?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam rearranged himself and his face slipped into a mask of impassiveness that Charlie was so not going to just let go. She crawled across the table, lifted his legs \u2013 which she suspected were going to be heavy but holy crap she almost needed <em>wingardium leviosa</em> to move them \u2013 and settled onto the couch cushions. Sam let her drape his legs across her lap but his expression didn\u2019t shift.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut with it, Rapunzel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well that got a reaction. And suddenly Charlie understood what the fandom meant when they said <em>\u2018bitchface\u2019</em>. It was very well suited to that flat, disapproving, <em>\u2018I can\u2019t believe you just said/did that\u2019</em> look directed her way. Charlie raised an eyebrow and wiggled her fingers at him, \u201cOut with it or I start on the tickling.\u201d</p>\n<p>And now Sam just looked amused. Of course, that probably had something to do with how she was a Hobbit compared to his Ent and she could probably hang from his arm like it was a tree branch. Charlie frowned and poked him hard in the knee, \u201cI can\u2019t help with getting them from UST to RST without the whole story so spill it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve kinda <em>tried</em> to get those two to realize it?\u201d He shot back, crossing his arms defensively over his chest, \u201cThere\u2019s only so many different ways I can say \u2018Hey I\u2019ve got research to do, I\u2019ll leave the two of you here in this motel room <em>alone</em> for the next few hours so have fun, bye!\u2019 And every time I come back and they\u2019re just watching TV or Cas is reading a book and Dean\u2019s taking a nap or something and I would <em>know</em> if they did anything because I\u2019ve basically been around Dean our entire lives and trust me, I\u2019ve seen the after-effect often enough to know what both he and the room look like and it\u2019s just <em>not happening.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam ended on an exasperated huff and titled his head back against the raised edge of the couch-back. Charlie waited. He hadn\u2019t relaxed any so she was betting all her chocobos that he wasn\u2019t quite finished yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they both know the attraction is mutual, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re both head-over-heels for the other \u2013 I can\u2019t even count the number of times Cas has sacrificed himself for Dean, for us \u2013 and Dean was just so\u2026 he\u2019s more <em>normal</em> now that Cas is back. He was kind of\u2026 scary, and not <em>Dean</em> when he first showed up. And he was keeping secrets from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecrets like this Benny guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 very astute.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a handy trait to have when you\u2019re as fantastic as I am.\u201d Charlie flapped her hand at him to dismiss the comment, \u201cContinue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam pouted because apparently it wasn\u2019t fair that being a pale-skinned Na\u2019vi didn\u2019t excuse you from having to talk about uncomfortable things. She stared at him, eyes wide and expecting and one eyebrow quirked <em>just so.</em> Charlie even threw in a little pout, because that worked wonders on guys. Guys like Sam, apparently, because he caved in seconds and explained the whole hullabaloo behind this Benny character.</p>\n<p>Charlie chewed her lip in thought, drumming her fingers on Sam\u2019s calf after he was done. Man, it was so lucky that the author \u2013 Chuck, apparently \u2013 wasn\u2019t publishing anymore. She could just see the shipping wars between the\u2026 the\u2026 Oh man, she had to name the ships!</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Sam nudged her with his heel, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh!\u201d She held up a finger, \u201cI\u2019m naming the ships, give me a second.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowned, \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re <em>what?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaming. The. Ships. Get the hair outta your ears. The fandom calls Sam slash Dean \u2018Wincest\u2019 and if I\u2019m going to keep all this straight in my head, I\u2019ve gotta give Dean slash Castiel and Dean slash Benny their own ship names.\u201d Charlie flapped her hand at him again before stilling, \u201cOh! Perfect! Destiel and Denny!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam was making another bitchface and this one was possibly even stronger than the last. Charlie didn\u2019t look. If she did, she might burst into flames or disintegrate on impact or something equally horrific. But she kind of wished she could take a picture of it, just for the fandom\u2019s sake. Not that the fandom knew that the Supernatural characters were actually real people, but <em>still.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine, sorry.\u201d She twisted around to get comfortable, \u201cOkay. So from everything you\u2019ve told me, Destiel is ridiculously canon and the fangirls would implode if they ever found out. But it\u2019s canon in the theoretical sense that it\u2019s <em>there</em> it\u2019s just not being acted upon because Subject A and Subject B are possibly too thick to know it\u2019s there or are both playing a sexual charged game of chicken to see who caves first. That sound about right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo we have to talk about Dean \u2013 who I\u2019d like to remind you is <em>my brother</em> that I have seen in sexual situations one time too many \u2013 having sex with Cas \u2013 who happens to be an <em>angel of the lord?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie affixed her own version of the bitchface in place and took a perverse amount of pleasure in making Sam flinch. She held up her hand, raising one finger with each point she made, \u201cFor one, it\u2019s ridiculously hot. I can\u2019t even begin to explain how hot it is. Two, they like eachother and are obviously into eachother and that much UST is going to result in pain whether physical or emotional and nobody wants that. Three, everyone deserves a little fun, even angels of the lord-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel that at some point I should mention that Cas was a millennia old virgin last I heard \u2013 and still is, to my knowledge - and you really need to stop looking at me like that because it\u2019s really starting to freak me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie wasn\u2019t sure exactly how she was looking at him, but it must have been something terrifying (maybe something shark-like? She could usually pull off a pretty decent shark look) because Sam actually did seem kind of scared about it and he was withdrawing into the corner of the couch with his knees to his chest. She reeled herself in with several deep, calming breaths.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny other points I had to make are moot now because Cas is a <em>virgin and needs to get laid by Dean as soon as physically possible</em>. They\u2019re obviously already in love and all we need is for them to jump that sexual hurdle and tattoo their names on eachother\u2019s asses or something. And you, Sam Winchester, are going to help me make it happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie reached out with her foot and closed her laptop with a flick of her ankle, \u201cIf you want me to finish hacking that bank and getting the names and locations of all those witches for you guys, then yes, yes you do. And I don\u2019t think your \u2018blood hound\u2019 can find them for you \u2013 otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have come to me in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam shot her a rather nasty look and wrapped his arms around his legs, \u201cFine, whatever. What do you suggest?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShort of stripping them and locking \u2018em in a room together? Nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>His nose scrunched at her words and Charlie thought it was kind of adorable and again contemplated the pros and cons of digging out her cell phone and filling it full of photos for the fandom. She wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to tell the fandom that Sam and Dean were real people. She could call them really freaking good LARPers or cosplayers. Hell, they could probably be the spokespersons for the book and if they agreed to do a few conventions, they could probably rake in a decent amount of cash.</p>\n<p>Her tangent of plan making went south (and not in the good way \u2013 it simply derailed) when Sam shook his head, \u201cUnless that room is surrounded by a ring of holy fire, Cas could just bamf out the moment you shut the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course that\u2019s only if he can resist the sight of a butt-naked Dean Winchester.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, stop putting images in my head. It hurts my brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuck it up, padawan. You\u2019ve got a lot to learn about the ins and outs of match-making.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly <em>want</em> to learn the ins and outs. I just want them to stop with the eye-fucking while I\u2019m in the room.\u201d Sam shuddered and rested his forehead on his knees, \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even understand how close they stand together. Castiel\u2019s always been bad with the personal space and Dean used to complain about it every chance he got. But now? Now they\u2019re attached at the hip and I always think they\u2019re one breath away from inhabiting the same pair of pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was some pretty decent eye-sex going on there, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Charlie donned her Sherlock-thinking-pose and stretched her legs out on the table, \u201cThis whole thing is just a matter of taking the eyes out and leaving them with just, y\u2019know, sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam made a little strangled noise, \u201cSeriously, please, I\u2019m begging you. Stop talking about them having sex. It\u2019s all well and good that we\u2019re trying to hook them up \u2013 but I don\u2019t just want them to start going at it like bunnies. I want them to be\u2026\u201d He flapped his hand and his face scrunched again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy?\u201d Charlie supplied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I want them to be happy. They both deserve it, like, a lot. You haven\u2019t even scraped the tip of the iceberg with how shitty their lives \u2013 our lives \u2013 have been since the Leviathans, hell even long <em>before</em> that.\u201d He shrugged again, chin resting on his knees, \u201cWhen Dean and Cas disappeared, I really didn\u2019t know where they went. I didn\u2019t have the first clue where to look or what had happened. I didn\u2019t even know if they were alive. I was alone and drifting and I found someone and I\u2026 I was happy. I was really happy. And when we\u2019re done with this case, I want to retire and go back to being that happy, if I still can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie watched as his eyes went unfocused and she knew he was reminiscing. She melted a little at the small smile that tugged at his lips because yeah, she could totally understand what he was getting at. It\u2019s what she wanted, kind of. Not that she had anything to complain about because she was really very content with her life. But that was it. She was <em>content</em>. Charlie could live out her life like this for a good long time, but she probably wouldn\u2019t be happy. At least, not the kind of happy that Sam was getting at.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want Dean to have somebody too. So he can understand that it\u2019s not just him and me anymore.\u201d Sam picked at the hem of his jeans and his voice kind of took on the sulking quality of a teenager, \u201cI want him and Cas to be happy together so that they\u2019ll have each other when I\u2019m not around. Around as much. I\u2019ll still be in touch, but\u2026 I\u2019ve got my own life I want to live too.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded, reaching out to pat him on the arm, \u201cI know. I read all about it and for what it\u2019s worth, I agree wholeheartedly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you agree not to talk about getting Cas and Dean in bed together anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie over exaggerated the roll of her eyes a wee bit and made a grand show of her defeated sigh, \u201cYes, fine. No more talking about them breeding like tribbles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Jesus Christ, <em>don\u2019t even joke about that!</em>\u201d Sam slapped his hands over his ears, \u201cAs if thinking about them having sex wasn\u2019t bad enough you had to go and put it into my head that one of them could get <em>pregnant!</em> You\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s <em>horrible.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell how much do you <em>actually</em> know about angel biology?\u201d She grinned, because now it was just getting way too much fun to tease him. Seriously, the Winchesters were like the big brothers she never knew she wanted.</p>\n<p>Sam went still in the kind of way one does when they\u2019ve come to a realization that scares them so bad they don\u2019t even breathe for nearly a solid minute. His eyes went wide and Charlie almost felt bad because he really truly did look frikken <em>horrified.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s just add that to the list of things we don\u2019t talk or ask about. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d She offered.</p>\n<p>He nodded slowly and pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes, \u201cOh God, I need some brain bleach and I need it right now. Just \u2013 never mention that again, okay? Never. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie sighed, pretending to be put upon by his request until Sam fixed her with a glare. She held up three fingers in the universal sign for the girl-guides, \u201cI do solemnly swear to never again bring up the topic that angel biology could quite possibly result in either Dean or Castiel getting pregnant. Girl Guides\u2019 honour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam made a small choking noise and scrubbed at his face with his hands, \u201cYou suck. You suck so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"If you would stop making it so <em>easy</em>, I would stop taking advantage of the gaping openings you keep leaving me.\u201d She stuck her tongue out at him and folded her hands over her stomach, \u201cNow. No talking for the next five minutes. I want you to think up all the possible ways we can get Dean and Cas to admit their attraction to eachother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you for serious? We\u2019re going to brainstorm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, we don\u2019t have to.\u201d She raised an eyebrow at him, \u201cYou could just live with perpetual UST, eye-fucking, and the knowledge that your brother might never be <em>truly happy</em> the way you\u2019ve always wanted him to be for <em>the rest of your natural existence.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A little huffing noise was her response and he dropped his head back to his knees, \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d She confirmed, glancing at the digital clock on her desk and starting the countdown.</p>\n<p>\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d</p>\n<p>To Charlie\u2019s surprise, Sam was the first to notice the time. She pinched her lips together, realizing they\u2019d been thinking for over ten minutes now and Dean could end up coming back before they even get a chance to discuss their ideas and come up with the perfect plan. Sam looked uncomfortable and that didn\u2019t bode well. Out of the two of them, he knew Cas and Dean better than Charlie and if <em>he</em> couldn\u2019t think up any good ways to get them to realize things, then Charlie had about as much luck as a good show on Fox Network did at not being cancelled (which is to say, none at all). </p>\n<p>She snagged her laptop from the table and booted it back up again, opening a text document, \u201cOkay. Out with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam chewed on his lip and his nose scrunched up and his brow beetled and he just kept staring at Charlie. She looked back at him with a skeptical eyebrow raised, \u201cYou <em>do</em> have something, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorta? But it\u2026 It hasn\u2019t worked so well in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat hasn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSitting Dean down and explaining feelings to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie leveled him with the best deadpan she could muster, \u201cReally? That\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell another option is sitting <em>Cas</em> down and explaining feelings to him.\u201d Sam shrugged, \u201cBut that might be just as useless because I really have no idea how firm a grasp Castiel has on human emotions. For all I know, he could be as emotionally constipated as Dean is.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes and blew a heavy breath out her nose, \u201cSo basically you\u2019re saying one of your plans is useless and the other requires more data for us to be able to determine whether or not it would be even remotely useful?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s response was nothing more than a groan and pressing his forehead to his knees again. </p>\n<p>Charlie shut her laptop because there really was no use in typing up a list of their options now that their options were narrowed to the few ideas she had. Ideas that \u2013 and she so was not going to tell Sam this \u2013 she\u2019s borrowed off of fanfictions. No, telling him that would probably be a very bad thing. </p>\n<p>\u201cReady to hear my plans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you mention nothing about being naked and sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGirl guide\u2019s honour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was only about the pregnant thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t <em>mention</em> it again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought it up again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, I said nothing about it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe girl guides thing was associated directly to it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I interrupted something?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really amusing that Sam\u2019s shriek of surprise is roughly the same pitch as Charlie\u2019s. They both look to the kitchen doorway where Castiel has materialized like he just threw off the invisibility cloak and Charlie really hopes he hasn\u2019t just been standing there the whole time. </p>\n<p>She blames that thought for the words that come out of her mouth next, \u201cCan angels go invisible?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam looked at her with wide eyes and a soft hiss of her name, like the thought occurred to him too but he didn\u2019t want to bring it up.</p>\n<p>Castiel\u2019s eyebrows end up pinched in a kind of confused-frowny face that is way too adorable for his own good (and Charlie thinks if he and Dean ever do hook up then Dean is <em>fucked</em> - in both the good and bad way). He looked to Sam and back to Charlie before responding slowly, \u201cYes\u2026 But it\u2019s more like standing in a level of reality slightly off from this one than it is, as you call it, being invisible. Being invisible would suggest I have a presence on this plane of reality that could be noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well, that\u2019s cool. Did you have fun wherever you bamfed off to?\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolled his eyes (the gesture a little too stiff) and dropped onto the chair again, \u201cNo. I was called back to Heaven to provide my \u2018opinion\u2019-\u201d Again with the air quotes, \u201c- on handling a situation regarding a demonic uprising in Czechoslovakia that happened quite a few decades in your past.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds\u2026 interesting.\u201d Sam unfolded, putting his feet on the floor and leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, \u201cIs it anything you want Dean and I to go take a look at? I know Dean hates you blipping us places, but he\u2019ll understand if you explain the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I just had to persuade them that smiting a town off the face of the Earth <em>in the past</em> is not a viable option. It could alter history. The town will be fine\u2026 now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Charlie really hoped he was kidding about angels even considering that to be an option. But judging by Sam\u2019s accepting expression, she might be entirely wrong about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cDean isn\u2019t back yet.\u201d Castiel stated, rather than asking and he frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Which actually, is a good thing.\u201d Charlie got up and relocated her butt to the edge of the coffee table so she was sitting directly in front of the both of them.</p>\n<p>Both Sam and Castiel looked at her with wide eyes but for <em>entirely</em> different reasons. Sam was horrified, probably thinking she was going to try his ridiculous plan of talking some sense into the angel. Castiel just looked surprised, and then he looked confused, as if it was completely unheard of that Dean not being in the same place as the rest of them could possibly be a good thing.</p>\n<p>Amateurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to check with you two about something about Dean.\u201d She twirled her fingers in her hair and adopted the most nervous and insecure expression she had in her arsenal, \u201cDo you think he\u2019d be\u2026 Well, do either of you think that\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath and blurted out the actual question in a quick rush (trying hard to not laugh through it), \u201cDoyouthinkIhaveachancewithDean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s jaw dropped with an audible pop that didn\u2019t sound very comfortable. His voice was three octaves too high for his following, \u201c<em>What?!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Operation: Make One Of Them Jealous was a go. </p>\n<p>Pretending to be attracted to men was just a sacrifice she was going to have to make. Charlie was ready to throw herself on this grenade because Sam probably wouldn\u2019t feel so very comfortable hitting on Cas (which was the other option for this plan). Though that would have been a far more hilarious path to take (and Charlie had quite a few good rebuttals for why he should be doing this instead of her). But then Cas had to end up coming back earlier than expected and now she was on a time crunch to get this done before Dean ended up returning prematurely too. </p>\n<p>Castiel was blinking. It was an exceptional amount of blinking, like he was surprised by the question and not sure how to react so all he could do was <em>blink</em>. He opened his mouth and his throat worked a few times before he finally, after several moments of silence, managed (in a completely level voice that Charlie was rather impressed by), \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 interested\u2026 in Dean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>yeah</em>!\u201d Charlie had to think of the most embarrassing moment in her life (getting her first period in the middle of the aerobics block in grade 7 gym class) to bring up the blush required for this particular role, \u201cI mean, who wouldn\u2019t be? Have you seen the ass on that man?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lying to an angel felt like she was performing at least fifteen different kinds of blasphemies and she really hoped this wasn\u2019t going to get her ass sent to hell and holy shit what if angels could read <em>minds?</em> But the look on Castiel\u2019s face was telling her a few things. First and foremost was that no, he most certainly was not reading her mind. Secondly, he apparently had zero idea of how to react because he was just staring straight ahead. Third, he had actually stopped <em>breathing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Cas?\u201d She waved her hand and snapped her fingers a few times to get his attention, \u201cYou still with us, buddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded woodenly, \u201cYou\u2019re attracted to Dean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d She frowned, trying to look offended.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? I mean, you\u2019re kinda acting a little weird. I don\u2019t want to step on any toes here \u2013 but he <em>has</em> played a leading role in some rather\u2026 erm\u2026 nice\u2026 dreams I\u2019ve had since I met you guys.\u201d The hardest part about this was not choking with laughter over her words. Yeah sure, Dean was attractive. But he was not even near her type even if you took into account the part about him sporting the wrong equipment. </p>\n<p>Sam seemed to be having a little difficultly of his own with this whole charade. He had a fist pressed to his mouth and he kept looking between Charlie and Castiel like he didn\u2019t know who was more amusing to watch. Then this little light flicked on behind his eyes and Charlie knew he was having some kind of lightning-strike idea. She hoped he knew how to improvise because seriously, if he messed this up she was going to get her lightsaber out and bust it on his butt.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Charlie\u2026\u201d Sam started quietly, choking on the words a little as his lips twitched in a valiant attempt to not grin, \u201cI thought you were\u2026 not into <em>guys</em>. Didn\u2019t you say they weren\u2019t your type?\u201d</p>\n<p>She bit her lip and leveled him with a glare because he just had to go and throw <em>that</em> wrench into the plan, didn\u2019t he? Castiel's head snapped to the side so fast Charlie half expected it to come right off his shoulders and he was looking at Sam with wide eyes, which ended up narrowing dangerously when they turned toward her. She shifted uncomfortably, the hard wood edge of the table digging into her thighs. Was it because she liked girls? Oh shit, wasn\u2019t there something in the bible about that being a sin? Was he gonna smite her for liking boobs? Or was he looking like that because he was catching on to the lie?</p>\n<p>Thinking like that could lead to the very ruin of this plan. No, she could still salvage this. The plan could still work! Think like Hermione. Think like Hermione. Think like\u2026 YES.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he might be my exception.\u201d She whispered, lowering her eyes and looking between the two through her lashes. Charlie was trying very, very hard to be coy. It was a look she didn\u2019t use often, if ever and she prayed to the four houses of Hogwarts that she was pulling it off right, \u201cSometimes when it just feels <em>right</em>, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re a different gender than you\u2019re usually attracted to. As long as the feelings are real, the body doesn\u2019t matter. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel had that whole epiphany look going on and Charlie\u2019s arm twitched in an aborted fist pump. She glanced to Sam and he was grinning like he\u2019d just beat the Kobayashi Maru without cheating. He was even so brash as to <em>wink</em> and she widened her eyes at him in warning, quirking an eyebrow toward the angel because if he gave off anymore hints she really was going to kick his ass.</p>\n<p>And suddenly Castiel\u2019s face was <em>right freaking there</em>. Charlie nearly fell off the table jerking away in surprise. His eyes were wide and hopeful and yes, she really needed to get his picture and send it to Webster\u2019s Dictionary for the definition of \u2018puppy-eyes\u2019 because there would never be a better example than this.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this apply to everyone?\u201d Castiel asked, voice pitched low in a whisper that had both Charlie and Sam leaning forward to hear. </p>\n<p>\u201cDoes what?\u201d Sam asked because Charlie sure didn\u2019t know what he was asking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis \u2018exception\u2019. Does everyone have an exception to their close-minded ideas of gender roles and what is considered the right gender to be attracted to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam rubbed a hand through his hair and sat back heavily against the couch, \u201cI dunno, maybe? Not everyone finds that someone. I mean, I like girls and I wouldn\u2019t say \u2018yes\u2019 to just any attractive guy trying to pick me up in the bar. But if that guy was\u2026 say\u2026 Robert Downey Jr. Well, I wouldn\u2019t exactly say <em>\u2018no\u2019</em> to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d Castiel frowned at him and Sam blushed, flapping his hands and muttering about how it didn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you asking because you\u2019re interested in someone?\u201d Charlie blurted the question because that\u2019s apparently what her current character does in nervous situations, not that she was actually nervous or anything. </p>\n<p>But she had a role to play and she was going to play it well, dammit. </p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s jaw did that popping-drop thing again because Castiel actually, honest to God, <em>blushed</em>. He sat back quickly and adverted his eyes, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Charlie pointed at him and then looked at Sam, \u201cIs that allowed? Are angels allowed to lie?\u201d</p>\n<p>He worked his mouth a few times before answering, \u201cIn our experience? \u2026 Yes.\u201d He sent an apologetic look to Castiel and the angel\u2019s shoulder twitched in a shrug like he didn\u2019t quite know how to properly execute one, but he sure as hell was going to give it a try.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s still lying. Who do you have the hots for?\u201d She poked Castiel in the knee and he looked at her finger before raising his eyes to her face, \u201cSince we\u2019re talking about the whole gender-thing, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a dude. Is there a Mr. Angel-of-the-Lord you\u2019ve got your eyes on? Someone with nice plumage, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>That just made Castiel look confused and Charlie\u2019s gut sank because this was starting to get not only a little bit annoying, but a whole lot more frustrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur wings are metaphysical manifestations of our grace. We don\u2019t actually have feathers. If I was to show you my real wings, your eyes would burn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t hedge the answer, shiny-butt.\u201d She poked his knee again, \u201cHave you got a man-crush?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what a \u2018man-crush\u2019 is and I don\u2019t have a 'shiny butt'. My true form may be a wavelength of celestial light and intent but in this vessel I am \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHedging!\u201d Charlie cut him off and threw her hands in the air before crossing her arms over her chest and frowning at the angel, \u201cIgnore the semantics and answer the question. Do you or do you not have an attraction to \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c- Dean Winchester?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>Dead silence.</p>\n<p>Edge of the black, kind of silence.</p>\n<p>Charlie\u2019s mouth was left hanging open because she actually hadn\u2019t meant to bring Dean\u2019s name into this at all. She had been hoping against hope that Castiel would be the one to say it first. Sam was staring at her with bald-faced horror, like she\u2019d just pushed Dumbledore off the tower while simultaneously kicking Gandalf off the bridge. </p>\n<p>Castiel on the other hand was swinging between two very different extremes. First pretty much every drop of blood drained from his face (the last time she saw someone that pale was when she was seven years old and looking at her great uncle Stu laying in his coffin at his funeral). And then he blushed so hard she was mildly worried his cheeks were going to bruise. That was followed by the most terrified, wide-eyed look Charlie had ever seen.</p>\n<p>Sam shot forward, nearly knocking Charlie off the table in the process, and grabbed Castiel\u2019s arm, \u201cDon\u2019t zap out!\u201d</p>\n<p>The angel was fish-mouthing and he kept fisting his hands in his trench coat and Charlie really just wanted to wrap him up in a hug and shush him and tell him it was going to be alright. Damn her maternal instincts. They\u2019d never shown themselves before, why start now with an <em>angel</em> of all things?</p>\n<p>She reached out and covered Castiel\u2019s hands with hers, \u201cTake a few deep breaths. You\u2019re not in trouble and we\u2019re not going to tell Dean if you don\u2019t want him to know.\u201d And she finishes with a mental, <em>\u2018Of course that\u2019s if he doesn\u2019t already know, what with you two being so painfully obvious that even Mr. Magoo would be able to see it.\u2019</em></p>\n<p>Castiel swallowed audibly. His jaw snapped shut and he slumped forward until he was almost bent in half with his face pressed to Charlie\u2019s forearms while doing the whole deep-breathing thing she\u2019d told him to do. She shared a quick, surprised <em>\u2018What the hell do I do?!\u2019</em> look with Sam. They both nearly jumped out of their skin when Castiel made a weird strangled noise in the back of his throat.</p>\n<p>His voice was really small and quiet when he finally spoke and Charlie could practically feel her heart breaking over it, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but <em>please</em> don\u2019t tell Dean of your interest.\u201d</p>\n<p>She winced and then double winced because Sam\u2019s glare was pretty damn scalding. It\u2019s not like this was what she was hoping when she abruptly dove head first into \u2018Plan A\u2019. There had been a time crunch and some mental flailing and grabbing at straws. At no point was Charlie ever thinking of hurting Dean or Castiel. She was just trying to make Cas <em>jealous</em>, not make him sound like a she\u2019d just kicked his sandcastle.</p>\n<p>So she said the only thing she could think of (again not the best choice, in hindsight), \u201cI\u2019m not interested in Dean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel went still and sat back very slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She confirmed, nodding her head and then spilling her guts (figuratively speaking \u2013 her swords were kept in the bedroom and she really didn\u2019t feel like performing seppuku in the middle of her living room today). </p>\n<p>Frankly, neither Charlie or Sam were prepared for the ridiculously displeased glare they received. They both adverted their eyes, lowered their heads in shame, and basically bared their bellies for the tongue-lashing sure to follow. </p>\n<p>It never came.</p>\n<p>There was just more of that really unnerving silence. </p>\n<p>Charlie chanced a glance to Sam and he was looking at her through a curtain of hair and it was by an unspoken agreement that they both lifted their heads to look to Cas. He was staring at a point over Charlie\u2019s shoulder (and she checked, just in case Dean was back \u2013 he wasn\u2019t), and his hands were resting on the armrests. His face was, unhelpfully, back in his epic angel look of stoic blankness. </p>\n<p>\u201cUm \u2013\u201d Charlie started. </p>\n<p>Castiel flicked his eyes to her and anything she was going to say threw itself off St. Bart's because there was no way the angel actually just said what she thought she had heard. Sam\u2019s goggle-eyed look of disbelief didn\u2019t really help her decide if she was hallucinating (she\u2019s pretty sure she wasn\u2019t eating or drinking anything to do with cacti today) or not. </p>\n<p>Charlie blinked and pretended to dig her finger in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked; what other plans do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie was not happy. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. She was <em>exceptionally</em> pleased that not only did Castiel willingly admit that he <em>liked</em> Dean, but he was also totally gung-ho with plan <em>\u2018Hook These Bitches Up\u2019</em>. What was leaving her a sour-wolf was that he was <em>shooting down </em>every single one of the various ways to go about bringing that plan into action. <br><br>Granted, all of her plans were more or less taken directly from fanfiction so she couldn\u2019t claim they were completely <em>stellar</em>. Not to mention that those fanfiction were mostly Wincest. And she was perfectly prepared to admit that succubus venom and fuck-or-die curses were probably not the best things to have started her list with (if Castiel\u2019s <em>\u2018I will smite you where you stand\u2019</em> reaction had been any sort of an answer). But finding out that Castiel was pretty much impervious to all forms of alcohol and that Dean\u2019s tolerance was bordering angelic had basically cut her list of plans in half.<br><br>\u201cYou sure you can\u2019t just talk to him?\u201d She asked, for what felt like the millionth time (though it was only the third \u2013 she\u2019d been counting). <br><br>She was spread out on the couch now, feet resting across Sam\u2019s lap while she stared at the ceiling, hugging a pillow to her chest. Castiel hadn\u2019t moved from the chair and Sam was slouched in his corner of the couch, long legs stretched over the coffee table. <br><br>\u201cI mean, really, all of this could be over and done with so much sooner if you would just say \u2018Hello Dean. I love you. Let\u2019s have the butt-sex.\u2019\u201d<br><br>Charlie was rewarded with a sharp pinch on the ankle from Sam and a snort of derision from Castiel as they responded at basically the exact same moment (which Charlie thought only ever happened on TV and in the movies).<br><br>\u201cI told you to stop talking about that!\u201d <br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t just want his <em>body</em>.\u201d<br><br>She giggled. Really. She couldn\u2019t help it. Her giggle subsided into a sigh and she rubbed her fingertips into her temples, \u201cI think we\u2019ve missed some steps here. Cas, what do you really want from Dean?\u201d<br><br>Her question was met with silence and Charlie tilted her head around the pillow to look at the angel. He was looking down at his hands in his lap, fingers fiddling with the edge of his trench coat. <br><br>\u201cI want Dean.\u201d<br><br>\u201c<em>How</em> do you want Dean? Mind? Body? Soul?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes.\u201d<br><br>Sam rested his cheek against his fist, elbow on the arm rest, \u201cI think what Charlie\u2019s asking is if you want Dean in a romantic relationship kind of way?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m asking.\u201d Charlie blindly gave him two thumbs up, \u201cLike, if Dean were to get back into a relationship with his last major love interest, would you be upset about it? How do you feel when you think about someone else touching or kissing him? Or if he was to tell someone else that he loves them?\u201d<br><br>More silence. <br><br>Charlie lifted the pillow so she could see Castiel\u2019s expression. She kinda wished she hadn\u2019t. Castiel looked about ready to bring down the wrath of Heaven down on her coffee table for having the unfortunate luck of being directly in his line of sight.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m actually scared for anyone who tries to get between you and Dean now or ever.\u201d Charlie chuckled. The situation was starting to get ridiculous. Her giggle morphed into a groan and she pulled the pillow over her face, \u201cWell what if we made <em>Dean</em> jealous? Sam. Hit on Cas in front of Dean.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m not going to <em>hit on Cas</em>.\u201d He pinched her foot again and Charlie dug her heel into the meat of his thigh in retaliation, \u201cThat\u2019s like five kinds of wrong right there and Dean will know it\u2019s bullshit before I even open my mouth.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat about if we go to a bar and someone hits on Cas in front of Dean?\u201d She mumbled from under the pillow, \u201cHell, I\u2019ll throw myself on this grenade <em>again</em> and do it for you guys. We won\u2019t even have to leave the house.\u201d<br><br>Castiel made a small scoffing noise and tilted his head back against the chair to look at the ceiling, \u201cDean took me to a brothel once in an attempt to rid me of my virginity before I was supposedly going to die. I don\u2019t particularly think he\u2019ll react much, if at all, should a woman make her attraction to me known in his presence.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d<br><br>There was silence for a moment as Castiel thought it over, \u201cSomewhere between five and six years?\u201d<br><br>Charlie choked and jerked the pillow away to glare at him, \u201cYou don\u2019t think that <em>maybe</em>, in that time, he\u2019s <em>changed his goddamn mind</em>?\u201d<br><br>Castiel frowned at her, \u201cHe\u2019s shown no indication of \u2013\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo, screw this. Hush your mouth shiny-butt.\u201d She struggled up into a sitting position, narrowly missing Sam\u2019s crotch with her heel, \u201cI <em>refuse</em> to believe that Dean Winchester will sit back nice and pretty while the dude he\u2019s in love gets seduced right in front of him.\u201d<br><br>Now Castiel sounded skeptical and that really wasn\u2019t going to help matters at all in the long run, \u201cWhat evidence do you have that Dean is in love with me?\u201d<br><br>Charlie pressed her lips into a thin line and she could practically feel the air souring around them, \u201cAre you blind? I mean, really. Seriously. Are you <em>blind</em>?\u201d She gestured at Sam, \u201cExplain to Spock. I have to pee.\u201d<br><br>When she returned from her impromptu bathroom visit, Charlie found Castiel and Sam sitting forward in their respective seats and engaged in an epic staring contest that could give the earlier uncomfortably-long-eye-contact between Dean and Cas a run for its money. Neither of them noticed when she took her seat back on the couch and it was another few minutes before anything happened. <br><br>Sam jerked back with a quiet gasp and then he was rubbing at his eyes, \u201cHoly shit that was weird.\u201d<br><br>Castiel sat back and stared at the opposite wall, one corner of his mouth lifted in what could possibly be the very hint of a smile. He didn\u2019t say anything.<br><br>\u201cI just wanna point out that the \u2018make Dean jealous\u2019 thing works better if he\u2019s in the room to see you being all doe-eyed with Cas.\u201d Charlie muttered, announcing her presence when an explanation wasn\u2019t given outright. <br><br>\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 No. He was checking my memories and stuff. It was the quickest way.\u201d Sam grumbled, shooting a glare at Charlie.<br><br>\u201cOh good.\u201d She smiled back at him with all the faux sweet she could before turning her attention back to Castiel, \u201cSo, do you accept Dean\u2019s got the hots for you?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes.\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood. And I\u2019d just like to point out that all of that that you just saw in Sam\u2019s head? All of that is just from <em>here</em> that <em>he\u2019s</em> witnessed. Neither of us knows about what Dean\u2019s like when it\u2019s just you and him, or what went down in Purgatory and I would bet my first edition D&amp;D handbooks that there\u2019s a whole bunch more evidence there.\u201d Charlie grinned, entirely too pleased with the proceedings as Castiel looked more and more accepting of the facts.<br><br>He looked at her and Sam with wide eyes, \u201cHe was given a means to leave Purgatory and didn\u2019t use it. He fought through a world of monsters to find me and even with the threat of Leviathan, he refused to leave me and insisted that we would return together.\u201d His voice went softer, quieter, and he looked down at his hands again, \u201cHe said he needed me.\u201d<br><br>Sam lifted his head from his fist, \u201cHoly shit. That\u2019s the closest you're probably gonna get to Dean outright saying he loves you.\u201d Castiel actually smiled at that.<br><br>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s wow.\u201d Charlie figured she looked like an idiot sitting there with her jaw hanging open, \u201cWait. Why weren\u2019t you together? Why did he have to find you?\u201d<br><br>His smile dropped and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat, \u201cI\u2026 left him.\u201d<br><br>Sam\u2019s hand clenched where it rested over Charlie\u2019s knee and his face tightened, \u201cYou <em>ditched</em> Dean in <em>Purgatory</em>?\u201d He sounded about as outraged as Charlie felt, but probably more so since Dean was his brother and all that. But she kept her reaction close to her chest, because there had to be more to it than that.<br><br>\u201cI had to. Leviathan were after me.\u201d Castiel lifted his eyes, looking at them steadily, \u201cEven after I told him that it was more dangerous to travel with me than without, he still wouldn\u2019t leave me behind.\u201d<br><br>Charlie actually grinned. Sam\u2019s hair flopped almost comically when he whipped his head around to glare at her because apparently this wasn\u2019t the right time to be smiling like a lunatic. She smacked him with the pillow because brotherly love was blinding him to their cause. <br><br>\u201cThis is perfect! This is wonderful! If you take out the fact that you were being hunted by terrifying monsters, your time in Purgatory was basically a <em>fanfic</em>.\u201d She thrust her arm out at Sam, \u201cLook! I have goosebumps!\u201d<br><br>Sam leveled her with a bitchface and Charlie actually shoved the pillow in his face. She completely ignored his displeased swearing as she wiggled until she was sitting on her knees, \u201cThis is so <em>shiny</em> I can barely contain myself! So now we know \u2013 for a <em>fact</em> \u2013 that Dean loves you. He basically came out and said it. We know you love him. We know you want him. Now <em>what</em> do you plan to do about it?\u201d<br><br>Castiel\u2019s shoulders dropped slightly and he frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br><br>Charlie groaned and fisted her fingers in her hair, hanging her head, \u201cAre we still not even slightly considering the option of <em>talking</em> with him? I mean, in the books Sam and Dean do eventually get around to talking about stuff. After it\u2019s blown up in their faces or something, but they do <em>talk</em>.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe books ended after Dean went to Hell.\u201d Sam pointed out, pillow settled in his lap, \u201cA whole universe of shit has happened since then and we\u2019re both pretty different from how we were before that. It\u2019s kinda what happens when you deal with <em>the Apocalypse</em>.\u201d<br><br>She pouted, \u201cWell, I\u2019m only using what I\u2019ve got to work with. Which is, need I remind you, the books and all of, like, 30 minutes of interaction between the two of them.\u201d Charlie waved her hand at Castiel and the door, and then paused with a thoughtful tilt to her head, \u201cSpeaking of\u2026 It\u2019s been way too long to get more beer. The nearest store isn\u2019t even a whole ten minutes away.\u201d She glanced at the door, frowning, \u201cSo what\u2019s taking Dean so long?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThat\u2026 is a very good question.\u201d Sam looked too and they both ended up staring at the door, watching it as if Dean was going to walk through the door the longer they looked at it.<br><br>Instead of joining in the staring, Castiel dug a cell phone out of one of his pockets and proceeded to do the what Sam should have been doing. He called Dean.<br><br>\u201cDean, where are you?\u201d<br><br>Charlie and Sam whipped around in unison, transferring their suspicious looks from the door to the angel. <br><br>\u201cAre you coming back any time soon?\u201d<br><br>They looked to each other, frowning, before looking back at Castiel.<br><br>\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d He closed the phone with a snap and turned to the pair on the couch, \u201cDean changed his mind and went to a bar. He says he\u2019ll return later.\u201d<br><br>Castiel actually recoiled a little when Charlie jumped to her feet, surprising Sam in the process, \u201cNo, no! This is perfect! This totally plays into one of the plans! Dean\u2019s already running hot from earlier, and now he\u2019s going to have who knows how much booze in him. If we pretty you up a bit, I bet we could get a girl to hit on you five minutes after we\u2019re in the doors. After that, boom! Possessive-jealous-Dean and suddenly you\u2019re making out in the back alley like Jack and Ianto.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know who \u2013\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot important.\u201d She flapped her hand and bounded over the coffee table, \u201cNo, scratch that. Very important. After we get you and Dean to announce your undying love for each other, I swear to your Dad that we are parking your butt on this couch and you are going to watch every single DVD I own. But first things first, we need to get you a change of clothes.\u201d<br><br>Sam raised his hand like the good student he probably used to be in school, \u201cWhere, exactly, are we going to find Cas new clothes?\u201d<br><br>Charlie froze mid-stride toward the bathroom. She turned slowly and frowned at the expectant eyes of her guests. With hands on her hips, she chewed on her bottom lip and thought over that very good, wrench-in-the-works, question. It\u2019s not like she had any clothes that would fit him. She might have the hair product and some lip-chap, but she was majorly lacking in all other departments.<br><br>\u201cWell\u2026 We\u2019ll just have to make do. I\u2019m going to get some things from the bathroom. Cas, you strip down to\u2026 I dunno, your lowest layer of shirt or something. Your pants and shoes will have to stay. Ditch the tie and the overcoat.\u201d<br><br>Castiel dragged his fingers along the lapels of his coat and Charlie would almost swear that he was pouting, \u201cI like my coat.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI know you do, sweetie. And it helps with the whole badass angel of the lord thing you\u2019ve got going, but in a bar you\u2019d be pegged as the dude more likely to flash you his junk and run away laughing instead of the guy you\u2019d like to take home and defile in every way imaginable.\u201d<br><br>\u201cCharlie!\u201d Sam groaned, dropping his face into his hands.<br><br>Castiel didn\u2019t move. He stared at Charlie evenly and she returned the look with a quirked eyebrow. It was pretty unnerving and she wanted to look away, but she had to hold her ground otherwise all of this would be for nothing. Yeah, she could probably just go back to running her program to find those witches without batting an eyelash and pretend like none of this had ever happened. But\u2026 where was the <em>fun</em> in that? <br><br>Sam sighed and pushed his hair back, tucking it behind his ears, \u201cCome on, Cas. I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d He physically cringed at the thought, \u201cI\u2019ll help you get ready.\u201d<br><br>Castiel\u2019s lips twitched and then he stood, shedding his trench coat as he got up. Charlie nodded in satisfaction and made a beeline for the bathroom. She didn\u2019t use hair gel often, mostly for cosplaying, but she still had a tub of it kicking around somewhere under the sink. She grabbed her hair spray, just in case. She got the lip-chap too, because Cas\u2019s lips just looked <em>painfully dry</em>.<br><br>Sam had Castiel completely shirtless by the time she got back. Charlie made a frustrated noise, \u201cI said leave his shirt <em>on</em>.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI know.\u201d Sam muttered, unbuttoning his flannel and shucking that off, \u201cI\u2019m giving him my undershirt.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAw, no. That\u2019s not gonna look nice!\u201d Charlie shoved her things into his hands, effectively stopping Sam from removing his t-shirt, \u201cHold these.\u201d <br><br>\u201cBut I \u2013\u201d<br><br>He sunk back onto the couch with a puppy-eyed pout when Charlie fixed him with an expression that clearly said that she was not to be messed with. It was a look she was particularly good at and used often in her D&amp;D group to quell the idiots. Castiel looked between them with raised eyebrows and the easy air of someone with zero embarrassment over being the only half-naked person in the room. <br><br>Charlie scooped his dress shirt off the floor, \u201cPut this on and start rolling the cuffs.\u201d<br><br>He did with calm, careful movements under her watchful eye, stopping with them tucked up just before his elbows. She stopped him from doing up the top two buttons and when he reached for his tie, she slapped his hand. <br><br>\u201cI said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d<br><br>Castiel frowned at her and Charlie grabbed his wrists, lifting them up and out of the way so she could tuck his shirt back into his pants. She scrutinized his belt and slacks, glaring at them like they had personally affronted her. Which, they kind of were. They just didn\u2019t fit right with the image she was trying to get. Charlie ruffled her fingers through her hair, thinking hard about the contents of her closet. <br><br>She had her costumes, and her fancy stuff, and her day to day stuff. Her pajamas and her winter clothes. But she was nearly half a foot shorter than Castiel and absolutely none of that would fit. And even if she could convince Sam to give up his pants, they would be way too big and far too unflattering for Cas. What she needed was a nice pair of jeans that were too big for her and too small for Sam, something like her ex-girlfriend used to \u2013<br><br>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Castiel asked, head tilted. <br><br>\u201cNobody move!\u201d Charlie bolted from the room and took the stairs two at a time to get to her bedroom.<br><br>Of course, neither of them listened to her because she heard them enter the room behind her as she pulled open the door of her closet. She ignored them and started pulling things out by the handful, tossing things over her shoulder. Sam gave a disgruntled shout and Castiel grunted in surprise as they took a Star Trek Ensign costume and a hoodie with built in Tauren horns to the face, respectively.<br><br>\u201cHoly crap, how much clothing does one girl need?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHush!\u201d Charlie hissed over her shoulder, elbow deep in a box of things buried at the back of her closet, \u201cThese are <em>essentials</em> that I\u2019ve carefully accumulated since you guys made me ditch everything when I went on the run from the Leviathans and I swear to Cas\u2019s Dad if this thing with the witches makes me have to run again, you\u2019re all buying me new stu\u2013 <em>Yes</em>!\u201d<br><br>Triumphant, Charlie pulled back from the closet waving her discovery in the air like a flag of victory. She turned around and pointed dramatically at Castiel\u2019s belt buckle, \u201cDitch the slacks, shiny-butt! I\u2019ve got something that\u2019ll make the entire bar look at you with stars in their eyes!\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly want them to do that.\u201d Castiel murmured, fingers working at his belt regardless, \u201cJust Dean.\u201d He sat down on the bed to work the pants off over his shoes.<br><br>\u201cNo, Cas, y\u2019gotta take the shoes off first.\u201d Sam rubbed his hand over his face, sounding more than a little exasperated, \u201cYou\u2019ll never get those pants off that way. And for the love of God, Charlie, please tell me those aren\u2019t what I think they are.\u201d<br><br>Charlie grinned, hugging her find to her chest, \u201cOh they are, they so totally are. If Dean doesn\u2019t drool out his river of D\u2019Nile once he sees your ass in these, Cas, then there might not be any hope for the good ship Destiel.\u201d<br><br>Cas looked up from pulling his pants off, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s the Dean slash Cas ship! Destiel! I\u2019m so clever.\u201d She practically purred before holding out the pants, \u201cNow put these on and let\u2019s see that butt!\u201d<br><br>Castiel narrowed his eyes at her before transferring his glare to the jeans, \u201cThose look\u2026 tight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThey\u2019re going to be,\u201d Sam muttered from behind his hand, cheeks pink, \u201cThey\u2019re skinny-jeans, Cas. They\u2019re <em>girls</em>\u2019 skinny-jeans.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy last girlfriend was about your height. And she made an <em>awesome</em> Seven-of-Nine. But seriously, just wear these. Do it. Now. I will not take no for an answer and I <em>will</em> manhandle you into them if I have to.\u201d Charlie bounced in place and held out her hand to Sam, \u201cGive me the hair gel.\u201d<br><br>He rolled his eyes and handed it over as Castiel all but writhed on the edge of the bed, trying to get the jeans up his thighs and over his thin, boney hips. Charlie slicked her fingers in the gel and gestured at Sam to help Castiel with the pants. The look she received was less than pleased and Charlie narrowed her eyes at him until he did. <br><br>\u201cStand up, Cas.\u201d <br><br>\u201cBut they\u2019re not on yet.\u201d<br><br>\u201cJust\u2026 stand up.\u201d Sam dropped the hairspray and lip-chap on the bed and hauled the angel to his feet. Looking entirely too uncomfortable with the action, he fit his fingers into the belt loops and jerked them up, actually lifting Cas off the floor a good few inches as he did it.<br><br>Castiel sucked in a breath and made an odd high pitched noise, arms pin-wheeling slightly. It took all of Charlie\u2019s not-inconsiderable amount of self-control to not laugh herself silly at the sight of a moose helping an angel of the lord into a pair of skinny jeans. Sam stopped and stepped away, hands up, \u201cDude, did that hurt you?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo. But\u2026 they are very... <em>snug</em>. I\u2026\u201d Castiel shifted, hand twitching towards his crotch, \u201cI think I need to make adjustments\u2026 And I\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to tuck the shirt in with these pants. There is simply not going to be enough room.\u201d<br><br>Charlie turned her back, \u201cWe\u2019ll work with that when we get to it. Adjust what you need to, I\u2019m not looking. Sam, help him if he needs it.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo, absolutely not. I draw the line at helping him with his <em>junk</em>.\u201d Sam hissed, sounding equal parts outraged and disgusted, \u201cJust, fix yourself and button up.\u201d<br><br>Castiel made little annoyed grunts and Charlie twiddled her thumbs to the rustling of the jeans. She was getting impatient by the time Cas hissed out a breath, \u201cThese are uncomfortable. But I\u2019m done.\u201d<br><br>\u201cGood!\u201d She spun around, smiling brightly as she pointed at the bed for him to sit, \u201cOoo! For an angel, you have some nice legs.\u201d<br><br>\u201cJimmy was a jogger.\u201d<br><br>Charlie stuck her gelled hands into the mess of Castiel\u2019s hair, \u201cWho\u2019s Jimmy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cHe was my vessel, but his soul has moved on now and this body is mine\u2026 What are you doing to my hair?\u201d He went cross-eyed trying to see as Charlie fixed it into her best approximation of disheveled-but-sexy-as-hell. <br><br>She opted not to answer and wiped her hands clean on the comforter of her bed and grabbed the lip-chap, \u201cPucker up, sweetheart.\u201d<br><br>He frowned and Charlie cupped his chin, squeezing his cheeks together and forcibly applying the lip-chap until his lips didn\u2019t look so painful anymore and were just a little bit shiny because okay, maybe her lip-chap doubled as her lip-gloss. Ignoring his curious and displeased look, she pulled him to his feet and examined his shirt. <br><br>\u201cI think\u2026 we can make this look better. Hold on.\u201d She moved to her dresser and started rummaging through boxes of odds and ends. She knew she had some things here that she could use, she just had to <em>find</em> them. \u201cSam, help him get his shoes on. He\u2019s not going to be able to bend over properly in those.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy lips feel tingly.\u201d Castiel murmured, pressing them together. <br><br>Sam caught his wrist when he went to touch them, \u201cYeah, don\u2019t do that. You\u2019ll get that crap on your hands.\u201d He dropped to his knees next to Cas, \u201cLift your foot.\u201d<br><br>Charlie returned to Castiel\u2019s side with safety-pins held between her teeth, \u201cArms up, hun. I\u2019ve gotta get at your sides.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m going to make them pinch up so your shirt doesn\u2019t hang so\u2026 so\u2026\u201d She waved one hand in a vague gesture while pulling the fabric together with the other, \u201cSo formlessly. I\u2019m going to give it some <em>style</em>.\u201d<br><br>Castiel frowned down at her, \u201cBut why?\u201d<br><br>\u201cTo get the ladies to notice you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t want the ladies to notice me.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou do tonight.\u201d<br><br>\u201cNot really, no.\u201d<br><br>Charlie huffed a frustrated sigh through her nose, plucking a pin from her teeth to fix the shirt in place. She looked down at Sam where he was trying to tie Castiel\u2019s shoes without getting in Charlie\u2019s way. Raising her eyebrows at him, she silently asked him to help her out. <br><br>Sam rolled his eyes and shuffled uncomfortably. \u201cWe\u2019re trying out the \u2018Make Dean Jealous\u2019 plan, Cas. If we get the ladies to notice you and Dean sees them hitting on you, we\u2019re hoping he, y\u2019know, reacts and acts upon his\u2026 latent homosexual feelings for you. Or something\u201d<br><br>\u201cExactly.\u201d Charlie nodded, \u201cAlthough\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cAlthough, what?\u201d Sam asked, cautiously. Which was entirely too uncalled for. This plan was <em>genius</em> and Sam shouldn\u2019t be scared of any aspect of it. In fact, he should stay on his knees and worship the ground she walked upon, thanking her profusely for not making <em>him</em> seduce Cas in front of Dean.<br><br>Charlie shrugged, \u201cMaybe the plan will work better if some <em>guys</em> hit on Cas instead.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>want</em> guys hitting on me.\u201d<br><br>She let her head droop before turning Castiel around to bunch up the fabric in the small of his back, \u201cYes, we know. But it\u2019s a necessary sacrifice to get Dean riled up. If anybody tries to take anything too far into the realm of \u2018uncomfortable\u2019, then you can just tell them \u2018no\u2019 and walk away. Sam and I will be there too, so it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br><br>Stepping away, Charlie looked her masterpiece over and smiled, \u201cWell aren\u2019t you just the prettiest boy going to the ball!\u201d Castiel opened his mouth to object and Charlie held up a finger to shush him, \u201cIt\u2019s just a saying. We\u2019re not actually going to a gala event. We\u2019re just going to the bar. Speaking of, Sam, you wanna gussy yourself up a bit?\u201d She eyed his hair and plucked thoughtfully at the hair-tie she always wore around her wrist.<br><br>He recoiled from her a few steps, wide-eyed like Charlie was going to pounce on him next, \u201cNo, I\u2019m good!\u201d<br><br>\u201cAlrighty then! Let me grab my bag and we can make like leaves on the wind.\u201d She led the way back downstairs and pulled on her jacket and bag. Sam locked the front door and she frowned at him, \u201cI dunno \u2018bout you, but we usually do that <em>after</em> we\u2019re on the <em>other</em> side.\u201d<br><br>Sam jerked his thumb at Castiel, \u201cAngel Airway.\u201d<br><br>Before she could turn around, Castiel\u2019s hand settled on her shoulder and Sam\u2019s. In the space between one blink and the next, with a sharp tug behind her naval and the sound of beating wings and rushing air in her ears, they were standing outside in the cool evening air next to a shiny \u201967 Chevy Impala.<br><br>Castiel pointed across the street to a bar with a flickering neon sign and a few smokers milling around the door, \u201cThat\u2019s where Dean is.\u201d<br><br>Charlie hitched her bag higher up her shoulder, \u201cWell then let\u2019s get this show on the road!\u201d </p>\n<p>The moment they stepped into the bar, Charlie knew shit was about to go down. She resisted the urge to grab Castiel\u2019s arm and drag him back out the front door before he even got the chance to look around. It physically hurt to not do that, but they needed to stay. This was necessary and by the fires of Mordor she was going to <em>make this work</em>.<br><br>Even if Dean was screwing things up worse than Pippin knocking the skeleton into the well. Truth be told, Charlie would probably pick handling a cave troll over what was about to happen.<br><br>Charlie knew the exact moment when Castiel saw what she was seeing. He went tense and rigid at her shoulder and the air around them <em>changed</em>. She seriously considered ducking under the nearest table when she could feel her hair start to frizz at the sheer <em>volume</em> of static electricity charging the air. Every light in the place started to flicker and the jukebox and TVs started changing songs and channels.<br><br>She was ninety-five percent sure that Cas was about to unleash a serious can of angelic whoop-ass and all of it was going to be directed straight at the brunette leaning heavily against Dean\u2019s side, an arm looped around his waist and her lips against his ear. If Charlie was to speak in Dean\u2019s defense, he did have his elbows on the counter and he was hunching over his beer. In fact, he really wasn\u2019t paying the lady much attention. But the whole problem with the matter was that he wasn\u2019t <em>telling her \u2018no\u2019.<br><br></em>The moment the lights started flickering, Dean\u2019s head snapped up and Charlie certainly didn\u2019t miss how his hand went to the small of his back, dipping under his jacket. There was something inherently awesome (and simultaneously terrifying) about having friends who actually carried weapons tucked into the back of their jeans. Dean stepped away from the woman and started glancing around.<br><br>Sam planted himself between Cas and Dean, \u201cCastiel. You need to reign in the mojo. <em>Now</em>. Before you wings pop out and we have to blow this joint before we make any kind of headway.\u201d<br><br>Castiel\u2019s glare was still on the woman. Charlie tugged on his arm to get his attention. It wouldn\u2019t do any of them any good if Dean saw Castiel while he had his smite on. It looked like it was physically difficult for him to calm down, but Cas allowed himself to be dragged by Charlie and pushed by Sam toward a booth by the wall opposite the bar. They weren\u2019t nearly fast enough to get their before Dean had spotted them.<br><br>To be fair, Sam was a billion feet tall and Charlie\u2019s (ridiculously beautiful, thank you very much) red hair were both highly conspicuous. Charlie lays blame at those fun facts for Dean following them across the bar to the booth. And she blames Castiel for the angelic mojo that had everyone kind of looking at them funny and getting Dean\u2019s notice in the first place. Luckily, the other patron\u2019s attentions faded away when the lights stopped flickering. She heard the bartender laughing it off as a \u2018power surge\u2019.<br><br>\u201cWhat the hell are you guys doing here?\u201d Dean started with the questions the moment he reached the edge of their booth.<br><br>Charlie flashed him her brightest, most conniving grin, \u201cYou drank all my beer. We wanted more. You came here instead of getting more. You\u2019re fairly smart, I don\u2019t think I need to do the math for you. Do I?\u201d<br><br>Dean narrowed his eyes at her. The look lasted barely long enough for Charlie to register it. In the next moment, he was goggle-eyed and red-faced and staring past her. He was doing a very good impersonation of a fish and his throat worked around words he wasn\u2019t saying. Charlie\u2019s fingers actually twitched for the cell phone in her pocket. These guys really needed to stop giving her such perfect expressions to be gif-ed. It was getting harder and harder to resist.<br><br>He finally managed to choke out one syllable, \u201c\u2026Cas?\u201d<br><br>Charlie looked back to Castiel. His hands were fisted on the table top and he still had that stormy look on his face. It was a slight hitch in the plan that he didn\u2019t even look toward Dean. She pressed her elbow into his side, widened her eyes and raised her eyebrows at him warningly when he glanced to her. His lips thinned out before he flicked his eyes up over her shoulder.<br><br>\u201cHello, Dean.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2026 Cas, what the <em>hell </em>are you wearing?\u201d<br><br>Sam was flipping through a menu, \u201cThey\u2019re called \u2018clothes\u2019.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThey\u2019re not <em>his </em>clothes!\u201d<br><br>Castiel frowned, \u201cThe shirt is.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou don\u2019t like his outfit, Dean?\u201d Charlie\u2019s bottom lip punched out in a pout to end all pouts and she looked up at him with wide, hurt eyes, \u201cWe spent a lot of effort getting him ready to come party.\u201d<br><br>Dean\u2019s eyes narrowed at her and Charlie had to wrestle with her self-control to keep her cheer internal because he was totally balling his hands into fists and she\u2019s ninety-eight percent sure that that\u2019s for physical restraint to keep from grabbing Castiel and kissing him senseless and not to keep from punching her in the throat. She knows he has no qualms about hitting girls because monsters aren\u2019t exactly gender-specific. But she hoped he\u2019d make the exception and not hit her because she is, in her opinion, far too adorable and loveable for that to be ever be allowed.<br><br>She\u2019s also reasonably sure that Castiel or Sam would stop him before he could.<br><br>The silence extended for an uncomfortable amount of time. Castiel continued to look at Dean in that unblinking way of his that never seemed to unnerve Dean the way it did everyone else. Sam seemed to be having difficulty keeping a smirk off his face and Charlie dug her heel into the top of his shoe. It wouldn\u2019t help anything if he gave things away. Seriously, weren\u2019t these guys professional liars when it came to having to get onto crime scenes and things? How could they be so <em>terrible </em>at following a simple little plan?<br><br>\u201cDean?\u201d Charlie prompted, all fluttering innocent eyelashes and perfect pout.<br><br>He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, \u201cLet me get this straight. You guys came here\u2026 to <em>party</em>?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI do believe those were the words that came out of my mouth, yes.\u201d She nodded.<br><br>\u201cSince when do you\u2013\u201d He flicked his hard edged look from Castiel to Sam and back again to include the both of them in his question, \u201c\u2013 <em>party</em>?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI thought it would be an interesting experience.\u201d Castiel answered smoothly and Charlie fought the impulse to hug him for his perfect reply. And then it got <em>better</em>. \u201cWith the assistance of Charlie and Sam, we\u2019ve dressed me in appropriate attire for our plans for the evening.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what \u2018plans\u2019 require freakin\u2019 <em>skinny jeans, </em>Cas?\u201d Suspicion was rolling off Dean in potent waves and Charlie could <em>feel</em> the glare burning the back of her head. But no, she wasn\u2019t going to give Dean the satisfaction of melting her face off with his laser-beam eyes. She was going to keep looking at Castiel because he wasn\u2019t done talking yet and she was just so <em>proud</em> of him.<br><br>\u201cYou make it a point of telling me, constantly, that as hunters any day could be our last. Therefore I\u2019ve come here tonight with the intention of completing what you attempted the night before we first faced Raphael.\u201d<br><br>At that, both Charlie and Sam looked to Dean. As far as he knew, neither of them were supposed to have any idea what that meant. They both shared a victorious glance when Dean paled. Neither one of them asked about what Castiel was referencing because Dean already looked like he was one word away from exploding.<br><br>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 <em>what</em>?\u201d Now <em>that</em> was definitely a squeak. And Dean didn\u2019t even seem to care that he was <em>squeaking</em>. He was staring wide-eyed and horrified at Castiel. Charlie took it as a victory that he seemed to have completely forgotten that she and Sam were also sitting in the booth.<br><br>\u201cCharlie, I would like to get up.\u201d Castiel nudged her shoulder with his own and then looked between her and Sam, \u201cI\u2019m going to go order drinks. Is there anything you would like?\u201d<br><br>\u201cJust a beer. Thanks, Cas.\u201d Sam leaned to the side to pull money from his pocket, \u201cHere, pay with this.\u201d<br><br>Charlie exchanged places with Castiel and passed him some money of her own, \u201cI\u2019ll take a Blue Lagoon, please. Can you make sure they make it with lemonaide?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOf course.\u201d Castiel paused at Dean\u2019s shoulder, looking at him coolly, \u201cIs there anything you would like, Dean?\u201d<br><br>Dean\u2019s throat was doing that weird thing again and his mouth was kind of hanging open a little. He didn\u2019t seem to know where to look. Charlie tried to keep a running tally in her head of how many times his eyes flicked from Castiel\u2019s hair, to his lips, down to his exposed collarbone and back up again. She lost count somewhere in the high twenties.<br><br>Sam reached out and tugged on Dean\u2019s arm and Dean all but completely collapsed into the seat next to his brother, \u201cHe\u2019ll take a beer. Just use my money.\u201d<br><br>Castiel nodded and walked away. Both Charlie and Sam watched Dean closely before sharing pleased grins. Dean either didn\u2019t care that he was being caught quite blatantly staring at Castiel\u2019s ass, or he had been struck dumb by the sheer gloriousness of a jogger\u2019s butt in skinny jeans. Either way, he was lost to the world and Charlie counted that as a victory.<br><br>She stole a glance after Castiel, just to make sure he was doing okay and to scope out the place for potential pawns in their plan. Charlie really wasn\u2019t expecting her brain to pull a Sherlock Holmes. And she certainly wasn\u2019t expecting her mouth to follow suit.<br><br>\u201cWasn\u2019t Castiel wearing boxers?\u201d<br><br>Both Winchesters looked at her with mixed expressions of horror and something that she thinks might be an expression meant to get across <em>\u2018what-the-fuck-why-are-you-looking-close-enough-to-notice\u2019</em>. Rather than let her own question throw her off track, Charlie pointed at Castiel and the skinny jeans. \u201cHe was <em>definitely</em> wearing boxers when I gave him the pants. But those things are so tight there\u2019s no way we wouldn\u2019t be able to see that he\u2019s got something on underneath.\u201d She looked to Sam, \u201cDid he take them off while my back was turned?\u201d<br><br>To his credit, Sam didn\u2019t flinch at the positively <em>murderous </em>glare Dean turned on him. \u201cYou would have known if he had.\u201d<br><br>\u201cTrue.\u201d Charlie mused, rubbing a finger under her bottom lip and letting her eyes go unfocused as she thought it over, \u201cYou totally would have freaked out. And he was definitely wearing them when you helped him into the jeans\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have helped him if he wasn\u2019t.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWere you looking while he was \u2018adjusting\u2019?\u201d<br><br>Sam shuddered and made it a point not to make any sort of eye-contact with Dean (probably because if he did than he was going to combust under the sheer <em>intensity</em> of it), \u201cYou weren\u2019t the only one to turn their back.\u201d<br><br>Dean relaxed marginally and his expression dropped from apocalyptic to nuclear. Which, in Charlie\u2019s opinion, was still verging on the spectrum of scary that the Dementors inhabited.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t guys have to worry about\u2026 I dunno, jean-burn or something? The friction can\u2019t be nice on his junk.\u201d Charlie made a vague gesture with her hand. She couldn\u2019t decide if liked their looks of horror or sympathy pain the most. The Winchesters could make some excellent faces if she chose her words right.<br><br>She chewed her lip thoughtfully and glanced back toward the bar again. Castiel was standing ram-rod straight beside the stools with his hands on the counter while waiting for their drinks. Charlie counted no less than six people \u2013 mostly women (and she couldn\u2019t decide if that was unfortunate or not) \u2013 eyeing him appreciatively.<br><br>Belatedly, Charlie realized they should have actually <em>discussed</em> with Castiel what he should do once someone started hitting on him. Standing around wasn\u2019t going to do anything. He needed to look <em>available</em>. Not that he <em>was</em> available, but really. If he didn\u2019t try and look even <em>slightly</em> approachable, their whole plan could crash and burn. Or\u2026 maybe not. Maybe the pants were going to achieve their goals all on their own. Dean certainly seemed to be having trouble <em>not</em> looking.<br><br>Sam suddenly made an odd little noise in the back of his throat and Charlie turned to him with a raised eyebrow. Dean, however, looked like it was physically painful to stop pretending he wasn\u2019t looking at Cas and actually turn his head to face his brother. Sam was looking out over the top of Dean\u2019s head and he was <em>grinning</em>.<br><br>\u201cViable subject at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d He tilted his head to direct their attention to a woman \u2013 the same woman who had been leaning up against Dean not too long ago \u2013 sliding up the bar with a generous sway to her hips.<br><br>From where Charlie was sitting, there were at least three possible ways this was going to play out. The first; Castiel would reciprocate her advances as per the plan. The second; he was going to smite her because she dared to touch Dean earlier. The third; Dean was going to drop her from across the bar with the gun hidden in the back of his jeans. Charlie\u2019s hopes were on \u2018option A\u2019, but if she had to put all her dragon eggs in one basket, they were most likely going to end up with \u2018option B\u2019.<br><br>None of them could hear over the music what was being said, but they were all watching \u2013 for various reasons of their own \u2013 as Castiel turned toward the woman. She was all smiles and bouncing curls and cleavage as she leaned against the counter next to him. Charlie pretended she didn\u2019t notice Dean\u2019s white knuckled grip on the table edge as nameless-woman-one chatted up Castiel and casually \u2013 though Charlie doubted there was a <em>casual</em> way to do it \u2013 reached out and slipped her fingers through the belt loops of the skinny jeans. Then she gave them a light tug and Castiel allowed himself to be pulled closer to her. Charlie would almost swear on her signed copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that she could actually <em>hear </em>Dean grinding his teeth.<br><br>\u201cWell,\u201d She cleared her throat and looked away as the woman leaned in to talk directly into Castiel\u2019s ear, \u201cIt looks like Cas might actually luck out tonight. And we haven\u2019t even been here for a whole five minutes.\u201d<br><br>A muscle twitched in Dean\u2019s jaw and he stared hard at something (which Charlie thought might be nothing, but she wasn\u2019t going to check) over her shoulder, \u201cYeah. Lucky him.\u201d<br><br>Sam pursed his lips and glanced between Charlie and Dean. This wasn\u2019t what was supposed to happen. Dean was supposed to get up and go over and stake his claim. He wasn\u2019t supposed to just sit there and glower like the kid who got sent to the corner for misbehaving. A niggling little voice in the back of Charlie\u2019s mind was telling her that there was more work to be done. And she really hoped that what she was about to do wasn\u2019t going to get her maimed or something.<br><br>\u201cOh shit, Sam.\u201d She donned a look of dramatic realization, \u201cDid we remember to give Cas some condoms just in case?\u2019<br><br>Sam\u2019s face did this twitchy little dance that was at once both amusing and worrying. It was like he couldn\u2019t decide if he wanted to give her a bitchface, or laugh at her words, or try and answer with a straight face. Dean\u2019s eyes went tight and dark for a moment and any answer Sam might have finally thought of giving never made it to the air because Dean just sagged forward to rub his forehead with his hand and pinch at the bridge of his nose.<br><br>\u201cDean?\u201d Sam asked, jostling his shoulder with his own, \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br><br>\u201cJust peachy, Sammy.\u201d<br><br>\u201cDid you drink too much?\u201d Charlie asked, leaning against the table and trying to look at him from under his hand, \u201cDoes your head hurt? I have some wicked awesome painkillers I use for my cramps if you want one.\u201d<br><br>Both Winchesters wrinkled their noses at that but Dean shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou sure?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes.\u201d<br><br>No. No, no, no, no. <em>No</em>. This was <em>not</em> how this was supposed to be happening. Dean wasn\u2019t supposed to just <em>give up</em>. Charlie and Sam shared a panicked look. She chewed her lip and glanced worryingly to where Castiel and nameless-woman-one (who happened to have some serious personal spaces issues) are still talking. Well, <em>Cas</em> seemed to be talking. The woman on the other hand was more or less plastered against him with her mouth still on his ear.<br><br>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be getting our drinks any time soon.\u201d Charlie dumped her bag in the corner of her bench and slid out of the booth, \u201cI\u2019ll go get them and give our boy some protection before the lovely lady holding his attention decides to <em>have</em> him without leaving the building.\u201d<br><br>She sauntered off with the expectation of feeling Dean\u2019s glare on her back. But she didn\u2019t feel anything. Charlie checked over her shoulder and frowned because Dean hadn\u2019t lifted his head or anything. His shoulders looked a little more tense, but he wasn\u2019t rising to the bait like they were planning. Sam was watching her over the slope of Dean\u2019s back. One shoulder twitched it what she figured was a subtle shrug.<br><br>Charlie scowled and stomped the rest of the way to the bar. She came up next to Castiel and reached for their drinks. He turned his head to look at her and the woman made a soft mewl of disappointment when it made his ear move away. Charlie wanted to slap her hands with a ruler and get her as far from Cas as possible because she was <em>really</em> starting to interfere with her ship. And if there\u2019s one thing you <em>do not do</em> it\u2019s mess with someone\u2019s <em>ship</em>.<br><br>\u201cCharlie?\u201d<br><br>She tucked the beer bottles against her chest, pinning them there with her arm. She left Cas his and picked up her drink. \u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d<br><br>Castiel looked over his shoulder and frowned at Dean hunched over the table. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not acting like we thought he would.\u201d<br><br>He hummed disapprovingly, \u201cDean does have the unfortunate habit of doing the opposite of what you want him to do.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, sugar?\u201d The woman leaned around Castiel to look Charlie up and down, \u201cShe your girlfriend?\u201d<br><br>Charlie snorted, \u201cNo way, <em>sugar</em>. He\u2019s not my type and I\u2019m certainly not his.\u201d She completely ignored the confused look she got in return and looked up Castiel, her eyebrows lifted meaningfully, \u201cMaybe, for this to work, you should be looking in a different direction. The same direction that Dean happens to be in. But not at him, you get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d<br><br>Castiel frowned at her for a few moments before nodding, \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting that I attempt to solicit the attention of a man instead of a woman.\u201d<br><br>Nameless-woman-one suddenly looked scandalized. She looked sharply between Charlie and Castiel. Realizing that she was being completely ignored, she huffed out a few choice insults that Charlie didn\u2019t register and she\u2019s pretty sure that Castiel simply didn\u2019t care enough to hear her and strode away.<br><br>Charlie winked, internally relieved that the woman was gone, \u201cBingo. And as a heads up, there are at least two guys who <em>aren\u2019t</em> Dean who\u2019ve been eyeing you up since we walked in. Oh, here.\u201d She ruffled in her pocket and held out an empty hand, \u201cPretend I handed you something and put it in your pocket. I told Dean I was coming over here to get the drinks and give you some condoms in case you got lucky.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd his reaction was?\u201d He passed his palm over hers and ghosted it over his pocket in a rather pathetic attempt at being sneaky.<br><br> \u201cI thought he was trying to explode my head with his mind.\u201d<br><br>His brow furrowed, \u201cDean doesn\u2019t have that ability.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI know it was just a ref\u2013 Never mind. Just add it to the list of things we\u2019ll have to school you in when you\u2019re done sexing it up with Dean.\u201d Charlie sighed, shaking her head. \u201cNow just turn around, lean back against the bar, cross your legs at the ankle and try to\u2026 look seductive, or something.\u201d She shifted her weight to look over his shoulder while trying to not look like she was looking over his shoulder (a tricky maneuver if there ever was one), \u201cOne of the guys who\u2019s looking at you like he wants to have you for dinner is sitting in the corner behind you. He\u2019s the one in the blue v-neck. When you lean back, look around the bar a few times. If you manage to make eye-contact with him because he\u2019s looking, don\u2019t look away. Hold it for a bit, even while taking a drink. Then look away but keep looking back every so often. He\u2019ll come over soon enough.\u201d<br><br>Castiel picked up his beer and turned around, \u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d<br><br>Charlie shrugged, trying not to spill any of the drinks on the sleeve of her sweater, \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t know. This isn\u2019t really how I flirt. I\u2019m more\u2026 <em>direct </em>when I pick up chicks. But I\u2019ve watched a lot of TV and movies and I hope to your Dad that they were at least partially truthful.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018direct\u2019?\u201d<br><br>\u201cIf I see somebody I want and they seem unattached, I go over and chat them up or make the first move, y\u2019know? If we hit it off, we hit it off. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. I like it simple like that. None of this pussy-footing around that you and Dean are doing, no offense. It\u2019s just really not for me. I\u2019m more action oriented.\u201d Charlie glanced back over to the table while she explained and frowned.<br><br>Dean was sitting facing Sam now, twisted at the waist so the bar was presented with his back. Sam was talking to him and he kept gesturing out toward where Charlie and Castiel were standing and she was totally going to buy him a cookie or something later for trying so hard to get the plan to work while Dean was being a dick and not playing along nicely.<br><br>\u201cSo you favour the direct approach?\u201d Castiel asked quietly, nursing his beer.<br><br>Charlie chewed absently at the straw of her drink. She was thinking hard about what she could do to help open Dean\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah, sure do.\u201d<br><br>Castiel hummed again before he put the beer down with a thump. She nearly choked on her sip of her cocktail when he brushed past her. Charlie really had to admire the skinny jeans as he crossed the bar in long, quick strides. A moment later, Charlie shook herself free from a jeans-induced stupor and trotted after him. She could see Sam\u2019s wide-eyed reaction as he sat up straighter.<br><br>\u201cSomething wrong, Cas?\u201d He asked when they reached the table.<br><br>Charlie would take her small victories where she could. Right now, she would count Dean turning around and looking up at Castiel as one. He was straight-faced, but Charlie really hoped the softening around his eyes was him being happy that Cas had ditched nameless-woman-one.<br><br>\u201cNo, Sam. Nothing is wrong.\u201d<br><br>Dean raised an eyebrow and his mouth twitched in what Charlie figured was him attempting a snide smirk, \u201cShe not your type, Cas?\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo, she was not.\u201d<br><br>Charlie came up beside him and slid into her side of the booth. She passed Sam his beer and placed Dean\u2019s in front of him. Still sipping at her drink, because <em>damn</em> blue lagoons not only looked good but they tasted <em>amazing</em>. \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem then?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere is no problem. I am simply taking the \u2018direct approach\u2019.\u201d<br><br>She choked on her drink.<br><br>Sam choked on his drink.<br><br>Dean raised both eyebrows and glanced between them, \u201cThere something I\u2019m missing here?\u201d<br><br>Charlie scrubbed her mouth with the back of her hand and coughed hard, \u201cWhat? <em>What?</em> You won\u2019t <em>talk </em>but you\u2019ll take the <em>direct approach</em>?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWe failed to take into account that Dean is a man of action. And actions speak louder than words.\u201d Castiel responded promptly before hauling Dean up and out of his seat by the lapels of his coat and pushing their mouths together in the surprise kiss to end all surprise kisses.<br><br>Charlie very nearly spat her drink across the table.<br><br>Sam <em>did </em>spit his drink across the table.<br><br>Dean went very, very still. He had one hand frozen on Castiel\u2019s wrist, the other paused in mid air reaching for his other arm. His eyes were wide and he was staring right back at Castiel because Cas was kissing him with his eyes open and <em>seriously</em> could these two stop with the eye-sex for like two freaking seconds? Then Charlie noticed it. Castiel was kissing Dean, but Dean <em>wasn\u2019t kissing back</em>. She felt her insides twist and turn icy and she couldn\u2019t imagine what Castiel might be feeling when he noticed (if he hadn\u2019t already).<br><br>The kiss ended as abruptly as it started.<br><br>Castiel stepped away and let Dean drop back onto the bench. Sam and Charlie watched Dean closely for his reaction. He was doing the stoic face. The same face he had before he left Charlie\u2019s house earlier. It did not bode well. Without taking his eyes off Castiel, Dean took his beer and downed it in several long gulps. It made a hollow thud against the table top and Charlie flinched at it.<br><br>Dean dragged a hand across his mouth and stood. Castiel took another step back to make space for Dean to pass him. Charlie and Sam shared twin looks of disappointed horror. Castiel\u2019s lips pressed together into a tight line and his eyes flickered to the floor before he bowed his head, his hands curled into trembling fists at his sides. Charlie\u2019s pretty sure his heart was breaking and hers was too.<br><br>\u201cCastiel, I\u2019m sor\u2013\u201d Sam started.<br><br>\u201cCas!\u201d<br><br>All three of them flinched at the sharp call. Charlie twisted around on the bench and peered over the edge of it. Dean stood in the doorway to the bar, propping it open with his back. He had one hand in the pocket of his jeans and he jerked the other to gesture out the door.<br><br>\u201cYou coming or what?\u201d<br><br>Best of all, he was <em>smiling</em>.<br><br>Castiel turned confused eyes to Charlie and she looked back at him, just as stunned. But unlike him, she was smiling bright and wide and victorious, \u201cGo get \u2018em, big boy.\u201d<br><br>And suddenly Castiel was all wide-eyed nervous innocence. He swallowed thickly and leaned across the table to steal Sam\u2019s beer, downing it in two long draughts. He did the same to Charlie\u2019s drink and she really didn\u2019t feel nearly as outraged about that as she should be. She didn\u2019t watch as he straightened his shirt and went out after Dean because that would be rude and even if Dean was privy to their plan by now, she didn\u2019t want to seem <em>that</em> obsessed with the results. She faced Sam instead and watched his expression like a hawk.<br><br>His whole face lit up before she heard the door boom shut. Immediately she leaned forward across the table, \u201cWhat? What did you see?\u201d<br><br>Sam grinned back, \u201cDean took Cas\u2019s <em>hand.</em>\u201d<br><br>Charlie whooped and punched the air and they high-fived with a resounding clap that drew way more attention than it should have and kind of made her hand sting <em>a lot</em>. With a grand wave of her arm, she shouted across the room to the bartender, \u201cA round of beer for everyone in the house!\u201d<br><br>\u201cHow can you afford that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not paying for it.\u201d She grinned, waggling her eyebrows at him.<br><br>Charlie was so pleased with how things turned out that she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to be bothered by the bitchface. She was running hot on the high of a successful plan (even if it didn\u2019t actually work out the way they\u2019d planned). This was almost as awesome as the time her group took down The Lich King.<br><br>Almost. </p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>End</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Castiel is nervous and his vessel\u2019s senses feel magnified. Dean\u2019s hand is warm in his and his fingers are tight as he drags him across the street. He turns him and presses Castiel against the car. The metal frame of the impala is cold against his back but Dean\u2019s lips are hot against his. He\u2019s a long line of solid <em>heat</em> pressed all down his front.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dean</em> \u2013\u201d Castiel exhales against his mouth when he pulls away to breathe. It\u2019s the only thing he can get out before Dean licks back in, insistent and possessive and <em>there.</em></p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s hands are like brands on his waist, fingers pushing up the hem of his shirt and searing the skin he finds there. Castiel doesn\u2019t know where to put his own. He\u2019s fisting handfuls of Dean\u2019s jacket before running them through his hair and settling them on his shoulders. He can\u2019t keep them still and they slip down along his back. He wants to touch all of Dean.</p>\n<p>Teeth play over his bottom lip and Dean sucks on it before soothing it over with a wash of his tongue. It sends shivering bolts of lightning down Castiel\u2019s spine and he stifles a moan against Dean\u2019s lips. Sinking his fingers into Dean\u2019s hair, he tips his head and parts Dean\u2019s lips with his tongue and he <em>claims</em>. He tastes bitter beer and the salt of peanuts and everything that is purely <em>Dean.</em></p>\n<p>He parts his thighs and Dean slides closer, fitting a leg between them. His pants are tight and firmly holding his growing erection down. It\u2019s uncomfortable and if he would allow himself to feel it, it would probably be painful. Castiel wants them off. He wants Dean\u2019s clothes off too. He wants to see and feel just how scarred Dean\u2019s skin has become since Castiel put together the grave rot that was left of Dean Winchester over six years ago.</p>\n<p>Six years. A pin prick in the <em>millennia</em> of Castiel\u2019s life. And nothing he has ever done, no one he has ever met, have meant more to him than the man rolling his hips against his. Dean swallows his startled gasp and his fingers tighten in the hair at the back of Castiel\u2019s head. They pull back, baring the column of his throat to Dean\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Castiel exhales heavily and his fingers scrabble for purchase on Dean\u2019s arms as Dean seals his lips over his pulse point and <em>sucks</em>. He presses his fingertips harder than necessary into Dean\u2019s back, pulling him closer. There are small noises tearing their way out of his mouth and he can\u2019t be bothered to stop them.</p>\n<p>Teeth scrape over skin and his hips stutter against Dean\u2019s. There is warm breath ghosting over his ear and Castiel has to bite his lip to stifle another loud moan when Dean\u2019s tongue traces the curve of it. He can\u2019t stop the second groan at the rumble of Dean\u2019s voice against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe touched you here, right? The chick at the bar. She put her lips on you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s fingers find Castiel\u2019s wrists and pull them away, pinning them down at his sides against the car door. He squirms, rubbing against the thigh pressed between his legs. Castiel could easily break his hold. They both know it and it\u2019s a sign of trust that Castiel doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cDean \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYes or no, Cas.\u201d Dean nips sharply at his ear and a number of things happen all at once with Castiel\u2019s vessel.</p>\n<p>The word escapes him on a hiss of air. \u201c<em>Yes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>He <em>whines</em>, loud and sudden. His back arches, pressing his chest against Dean\u2019s. His hips twitch hard against him. Dean is smiling against his skin, he can feel it with the press of lips to the soft skin below his ear. He does it again, worrying the lobe between lips and teeth before sucking hard and dipping his tongue in. It makes Castiel\u2019s whole body tremble.</p>\n<p>Castiel can sense eyes watching them. He knows they\u2019re out in the open, pressed against the impala on the side of a street and Castiel is being anything but quiet. He wants to hear the same sounds from Dean. He <em>wants</em> everything Dean is willing to give. And he doesn\u2019t want anyone else to have it, to see it, to <em>hear </em>it, ever again.</p>\n<p>He surges forward and hooks his foot behind Dean\u2019s ankle. He pulls and pushes, forcing Dean back and for one moment Dean is wide-eyed and falling. Castiel spreads his wings in the sub-space where he hides them. They beat once, twice, and Dean\u2019s fall is stopped by the mattress of Charlie\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit! Cas!\u201d Dean sits up only to be pushed back down, Castiel\u2019s hand firm against his chest.</p>\n<p>Castiel straddles Dean\u2019s lap and ignores the tight stretch of the jeans over his erection. He\u2019ll deal with that later. Dean\u2019s hands are on his thighs and sliding up to his hips as Castiel leans over him. He tips his chin up and Castiel knows Dean is expecting a kiss, but he isn\u2019t going to give him that. Not yet. He needs to do for Dean what he\u2019s already done for him.</p>\n<p>Dean makes a noise of protest as Castiel grips his chin and makes him turn his head to the side. Castiel is more harsh with his teeth and tongue and lips than Dean was as he cleans away the smears of lipstick along the edge of his ear. The taste is cloying and he can smell her perfume. He cleanses his palate with the salt of Dean\u2019s skin and rubs the stubble of his cheek and jaw against Dean\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe touched you too.\u201d He\u2019s almost startled by his own voice. It\u2019s rasping and deep. Dean groans and bucks against him and if Castiel was allowing himself to move, it might have unseated him. \u201cWhere else did she touch you?\u201d</p>\n<p>His hands find their way under Dean\u2019s jacket and the flannel over shirt. He presses rough, nibbling kisses along the line of Dean\u2019s jaw until he reaches his lips again. Dean lifts his head from the bed, seeking another burning kiss like the ones they shared against the car. Castiel pulls back after the first tantalizing brush of lips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dean</em>. Where else did she touch you?\u201d He repeats the question with narrowed eyes. If she touched Dean elsewhere then Dean needs to be cleansed of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, Cas, that was it. Now <em>get down here</em>.\u201d Dean fists handfuls of Castiel\u2019s shirt and he allows himself to be pulled into another bruising kiss that leaves him breathless.</p>\n<p>He feels his shirt get pulled tight across his back before he hears the sound of stitches popping. It\u2019s a monumental effort of will to pull away from Dean\u2019s lips and tongue. Castiel looks down at the tatters that remain of the front of his shirt. Only the top two buttons, which weren\u2019t even buttoned in the first place, are still attached. The rest are scattered across Dean\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Castiel sits back and shrugs the shirt off. It\u2019s fixed and devoid of safety pins before it even hits the floor. Dean works his arms out of his jacket and over shirt, leaving them lying on the bed as he sits up. His mouth is warm and wet on Castiel\u2019s clavicle and his hands are everywhere. They\u2019re firm but fleeting over his chest, thumbs pausing only a moment to rub at his nipples. The action elicits another full-body quake and Castiel tips his head back with his moan.</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s grin is obvious and he trails kisses down Castiel\u2019s chest. His licks and sucks and bites are experimental. Castiel knows he\u2019s testing all areas for his reactions. He presses himself as tightly inside his vessel as he can, soaking up every sensation and how it makes his body tremble. Dean\u2019s hands pass over his ribs and up along his shoulder blades and down his spine. They move around his hips, fingers skirting the hem of the low slung jeans until he presses warm palms to Castiel\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>He slides his fingers up Dean\u2019s back, dragging the t-shirt with them. Dean grunts in annoyance when he has to move away to allow it to be pulled over his head. Castiel throws it over his shoulder and leans against Dean as he moves his clothing off the blankets. Dean wraps his arms around Castiel\u2019s waist and drags him with him when he shimmies further up the bed.</p>\n<p>Castiel blindly finds Dean\u2019s lips again and presses quick, insistent kisses to them. It\u2019s his turn to touch and taste and map the differences of Dean\u2019s body since the last time he held it in his hands. He copies the same path Dean took, stopping to pay special attention to the areas that make Dean react. They aren\u2019t all the same as his own.</p>\n<p>His hands work over Dean\u2019s sides and his stomach and he ghosts his fingers over the swell of Dean\u2019s shoulder where his handprint once marked it. Dean\u2019s arms twitch and tighten where they still hold Castiel.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you fix it?\u201d Dean mumbles into his hair and Castiel lifts his head from tasting the tattoo above his heart, eyebrow raised in question. Dean\u2019s face is turned and he\u2019s looking down at his shoulder. \u201cIt was gone after Stull. When you fixed me up, why\u2019d you get rid of it too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel tilts his head and examines Dean\u2019s shoulder. He quirks a small smile and presses his hand unerringly over the exact spot the handprint used to be. He watches Dean closely before sending a pulse of his grace through his palm and fingertips. Dean gives a surprised shout that quickly dissolves into a pleased groan. His back arches almost violently beneath Castiel.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>hell</em> was <em>that</em>?\u201d Dean gasps, struggling to prop himself up on his elbows.</p>\n<p>He moves his hand and the red of the brand burns brightly against Dean\u2019s skin. Castiel leans forward and presses a soft kiss to the center of the palm print. Dean hisses and his hips twitch. Castiel can feel him hard and hot through the layers of clothing they both still wear. It sends a shivering bolt of <em>want </em>to curl low and throbbing in his gut.</p>\n<p>They both watch as the mark fades, leaving Dean\u2019s shoulder smooth again. Castiel traces his fingertips over the spot. \u201cStull was two years after I\u2019d raised you from perdition. It should have healed on its own without leaving a scar within the first year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel shifts and presses his forehead to Dean\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was selfish. I liked that humans, demons, angels, that <em>everyone </em>could see that <em>I</em> was the one who pulled you out of Hell. Not Uriel or Hester or anyone else, but <em>me</em>. And every time I was around you, I used my grace to keep it in place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean starts to card his fingers through Castiel\u2019s hair and he pushes up into the touch. Dean\u2019s voice makes the skin beneath his lips vibrate. \u201cThat why it went away after Stull? Because you weren\u2019t around to keep it there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mark is burned onto your soul, Dean. Not your body. It\u2019ll always be there.\u201d He spaces his words with kisses to Dean\u2019s collarbone, following it to the dip at the hollow of his throat. \u201cThe moment God brought me back after Stull, I knew I was going to have to leave you and return to Heaven to \u2018play sheriff\u2019. At the time, I didn\u2019t think I would see you again. Healing the scar was\u2026 me letting you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean is quiet and Castiel takes advantage of the silence to suck and bite several red marks around his neck. They\u2019re low enough that the collar of his t-shirt will hide them. He brushes his thumb over his art work and notes the shiver that runs its course through Dean\u2019s body. He moves up to kiss Dean and taste him again. The look in Dean\u2019s eyes stops him cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what happened with Purgatory?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice is flat and hard and he wants to flinch away from it. \u201cYou just <em>\u2018let me go\u2019</em> again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel doesn\u2019t know how to answer. He opens his mouth, but no words come out. Dean\u2019s leg shifts and he plants his foot on the bed. Castiel lets Dean roll them over until he\u2019s hovering above him. He can\u2019t begin to count the number of different emotions he sees in Dean\u2019s face, in his eyes. But he sees the pain, the hurt and the betrayal.</p>\n<p>He reaches up with both hands. He wants to cradle Dean to him and sing promises that he\u2019ll never leave him. Not again, not ever. But Dean grabs his wrists and pins them to the bed beside his head. Castiel doesn\u2019t fight him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy this, Cas? Why now?\u201d</p>\n<p>This is a simple answer and Castiel responds without hesitation. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel frowns. It\u2019s hard to even think of a time when he didn\u2019t want Dean. He\u2019s loved Dean since he first found the ragged smoke-edged light of his soul in Hell. But when did he start to <em>want</em> Dean in this way?</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He answers truthfully and he doesn\u2019t look away from the confusion that flashes over Dean\u2019s expression. \u201cSince the brothel? Before? After? I don\u2019t <em>know. </em>I don\u2019t remember <em>when </em>I started wanting you instead of just loving you.\u201d Dean swallows thickly at those words. Castiel continues. \u201cBut Charlie and Sam\u2019s efforts tonight made me realize I can\u2019t stand letting anyone else have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want me when we were in Purgatory?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel remembers every single one of Dean\u2019s prayers calling for him. He remembers how much it hurt to hear them and have to stay away. He remembers the sound of Dean\u2019s voice when he was crouched at the riverbank and the smile on Dean\u2019s face. He hadn\u2019t seen him smile like that in too long a time. He remembers how hard it was to not collapse into Dean\u2019s hug and hold onto him and never let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you still picked Purgatory.\u201d Dean\u2019s words are accusing and Castiel closes his eyes to them. The hold on his wrist tightens. \u201cLook at me, Cas. I wanna know <em>why</em>. Why did you choose <em>Purgatory </em>over <em>me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel\u2019s jaw clenches against a wave of frustration. This is <em>not</em> how he thought things would be going by now. He opens his eyes and his frustration ebbs at the desperation on Dean\u2019s face. Dean doesn\u2019t understand and he won\u2019t be able to until Castiel explains. Dean won\u2019t be able to accept Castiel like this until he can understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI went to you. Before I made the deal with Crowley, I went to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean is still and his eyes are wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were raking the leaves in the yard. You didn\u2019t know Sam was alive and I could have told you, I <em>should</em> have told you, but I didn\u2019t because Sam didn\u2019t. I thought he knew best. You were out of the hunting business and if I went to you with my problems, I would be putting more weight on your shoulders than you should ever have to bear and I <em>couldn\u2019t</em> do it. Not after everything you did and everything you sacrificed. Not when you had the closest thing to peace you might ever know. I made the deal with Crowley to spare you of my troubles.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s coming in a rush now and Castiel won\u2019t stop it. Dean needs to hear it all. He needs to understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Sam brought you back to hunting, when you called me down to help with the staff of Moses, I should have told you about the deal. I should have told you what I was planning. I didn\u2019t because it was still more than you should have to bear. I hid it all from you to protect you. It was my war. If I brought you into it, Raphael would have used you against me. It was a war you never would have been able to fight in and I still don\u2019t know of any way you would have been able to help. \u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses and even though Dean tightens his fingers around his wrists again, Castiel closes his eyes. There is a tightness in his throat that makes it hard to swallow, hard to breathe. \u201cAnd then I betrayed you in the worst way. I tore down Sam\u2019s wall. I hurt the one person you care most about in this world because I knew it would distract you from stopping me. But it didn\u2019t. You still tried. You tried and you failed because I was stubborn and so sure that what I was doing was right. That the souls from Purgatory would help me save what was left of my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel looks up at Dean again. \u201cIt took too long to realize that the angels may be my family, but they are not my <em>family</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean lets out a shaky breath and his head dips lower. His mouth is only a few inches away and Castiel wants to rise up and presses kisses to it. He wants to trace its edges and taste the smooth veneer of his teeth and the velvet of his tongue. But he can\u2019t because Dean doesn\u2019t understand yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t deserve to be saved. Not after all that. Not after what I did to you, to Earth, to Heaven. Not after unleashing the Leviathans. But God brought me back anyway. Saving Sam? Killing Dick? That\u2019s not nearly enough penance, Dean. Not after everything I destroyed. Purgatory was where I <em>belonged</em>. It\u2019s where I planned to stay even before you found me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He swallows around the lump in his throat and takes a deep breath. He holds it for a long moment before continuing. \u201cI wanted you out of Purgatory. I wanted you <em>safe</em>. But you\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t leave me and I had to get you out. I never wanted to give you false hope, Dean, but going with you was the only way. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to understand how much that hurt, how hard it was to walk with you and deceive you a second time. It took everything I had to let you go again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean leans down the rest of the way and presses his forehead against Castiel\u2019s, his eyes falling closed. \u201cWas that why you didn\u2019t tell me you wanted me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t going home without you. I told you I needed you. Coz\u2019 I do, Cas. I wanted to wait until we were home, until we were <em>safe </em>to say anything \u2013 do anything \u2013 about how much I\u2019ve wanted you.\u201d He dips his chin and presses a too soft kiss to his mouth. Castiel tries to chase after it and grunts his disapproval when Dean pulls out of reach. \u201cBut then you picked Purgatory over me. I thought I failed you and then you told me I was <em>wrong</em> and that I didn\u2019t fail you and that you <em>left me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDean \u2013\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then you came back. You keep coming back to me and what the hell was I supposed to think, Cas? You picked Purgatory over me and I thought you didn\u2019t want me. I couldn\u2019t deal with telling you and risking losing you. I can\u2019t lose you again. I need you, Cas.\u201d He presses his face against Castiel\u2019s neck. \u201cI <em>need </em>you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard enough. And at the same time, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever not want to hear it.</p>\n<p>Castiel flips them, despite Dean\u2019s startled grunt. Their kisses are rough and desperate. He\u2019s making little noises in the back of his throat and he doesn\u2019t know why but he can\u2019t stop. He mumbles Dean\u2019s name with every breath and he feels like he\u2019s going to explode because Sam was right. Dean loves him and he loves Dean and he can have this. If there is anything he can have, all he needs is <em>this</em>. All he needs is <em>him.</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mine.</em>\u201d It comes out as a growl and Castiel ducks his head to press a bite into Dean\u2019s shoulder. He pushes his grace under his skin and Dean jerks up again, hissing out Castiel\u2019s name. He likes the sound of it. The handprint flares back up, red and angry across his shoulder and it stays.</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s hands are on his ass, pulling him down to meet the roll of his hips. The friction is a good burn and fans the fire that\u2019s been burning in his belly since he saw Dean in the bar. He puts his lips to Dean\u2019s ear and nips at the lobe like Dean showed him. He speaks low and soft through his panting breaths. \u201cI need you too, Dean, and I will<em> always </em>come back to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both know it\u2019s a promise Castiel won\u2019t be able to keep. No matter what, Castiel will always try to protect Dean. He\u2019ll always put himself in danger if it means he can keep Dean safe. And he knows Dean will do the same for him without a second thought. In the lifestyle they lead, those are dangerous paths to take and if Castiel dies, there is no guarantee that God will bring him back again. He doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019ll make that promise over and over because the only thing that will ever keep him from Dean \u2013 now that he knows Dean is his as much as he is Dean\u2019s \u2013 is <em>Death.</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Cas</em>.\u201d Dean groans, fingers tightening. \u201cGet these fuckin\u2019 skinny jeans <em>off</em>.\u201d Castiel\u2019s grace swells, ready to wish them away with a thought, but Dean dips his thumbs under the waistband. \u201cDo it the slow way, Cas. Wanna see\u00a0 you strip for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel sits back slowly. Dean is flushed and panting and grinning. He\u2019s watching him from under half-lidded eyes and his hips keep rocking up against him. Castiel presses his lips together and looks down at the button-fly of the jeans. He thumbs them open and stops.</p>\n<p>\u201cDean, I\u2019m aware of what you\u2019re asking...\u201d He lifts his eyes to Dean\u2019s expectant look. \u201cBut apparently all the research I\u2019ve done watching television has not prepared me for life on Earth \u2013 as you\u2019ve mentioned previously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCas, if you\u2019re trying to tell me you don\u2019t know how to take off a pair of pants before sex\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know howto take off clothing, Dean.\u201d Castiel looks down at him steadily. Dean\u2019s frowning now and he doesn\u2019t like it. He leans forward to kiss the sulk away and murmurs against his lips. \u201cI have a rudimentary idea of what I should do, but I want you to teach me. Show me what I should do to please you. Tell me how you want me.\u201d</p>\n<p>For several seconds Dean does nothing but blink up at him with wide eyes. He squeezes them shut and tilts his head back with a groan. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>.\u201d Dean loops an arm over Castiel\u2019s shoulders and pulls him down into a hard kiss that is little more than a crash of mouths and teeth and tongues.</p>\n<p>He rolls them again and starts tracking another course down Castiel\u2019s chest. Dean grunts soft words against his skin between bites and sucking kisses and sweeps of his tongue. \u201cDo you have <em>any</em> idea what you <em>do </em>to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an idea-ah!\u201d His hips jerk when Dean\u2019s tongue dips into his navel. \u201cAn idea of what I\u2019d like to do to <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean groans again and rests his forehead against the slope of his stomach. Castiel brushes his fingers through Dean\u2019s hair, dancing them along the back of his neck and across his shoulders. Warm breath is sliding across his skin and into the opening of the jeans. It makes Castiel squirm and buck his hips. He wants more.</p>\n<p>He cants his hips upward, searching for friction, for something, for <em>anything</em>. Dean doesn\u2019t disappoint. Castiel makes a strangled noise of surprise when Dean mouths at his erection through the front of the jeans. He whines when Dean doesn\u2019t stay long, lips moving down one leg. Dean\u2019s fingers work quickly to divest Castiel of his shoes and socks and then that mouth \u2013 that hot, wet, glorious <em>mouth</em> \u2013 is back. Castiel squirms to help Dean pull the jeans down off his hips and then Dean\u2019s pulling them off his legs and tossing them away and he\u2019s looking at Castiel like Castiel is something precious, something to be treasured, something to be <em>kept</em>.</p>\n<p>He reaches for him and Dean comes willingly, but he doesn\u2019t settle against Castiel. He remains just above him, straddling only one of his legs. He\u2019s close enough that Castiel can feel the heat from his skin but far enough that he can\u2019t <em>feel</em> his skin. Dean kisses him slowly, gently, but the kiss is on <em>fire</em>. Castiel can\u2019t get enough of the taste of Dean and he paws at the jeans he\u2019s <em>still </em>wearing. He fumbles a hand between them and Dean breaks the kiss to look down and watch as Castiel undoes his belt and opens his jeans.</p>\n<p>Castiel\u2019s dick is hard against his stomach and he\u2019s leaking clear little drops of precome. Dean pushes his hands out of the way and finally, <em>finally</em>, touches him. He hisses in pleased surprise when Dean runs the heel of his palm down the length of his dick, fingers curling, cupping, teasing. Castiel\u2019s breath hitches and his hips won\u2019t hold still, rolling in tiny thrusts into Dean\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still not enough.</p>\n<p>Castiel is quick and efficient and maybe just a little frantic. He wants Dean naked and wet and <em>moving</em>. Against him, in him, on him, he doesn\u2019t care as long as he gets to <em>have </em>Dean. Dean\u2019s jeans and underpants make it halfway down his thighs before Castiel gives up on them and with a thought, he wishes the rest of his clothing away.</p>\n<p>Dean laughs. \u201cImpatient, are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Castiel pulls him back down and Dean open willingly to the insistent push of his tongue. He tastes every corner of his mouth and draws Dean back into his and he groans when Dean pulls away. \u201c<em>Dean.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh, Cas. Just lemme do this, okay?\u201d He kisses him once, lightly, before sitting back on his heels.</p>\n<p>Castiel buries his fingers in the blankets before he tries to force Dean back against him. Dean\u2019s hands are on Castiel\u2019s hips, thumbs brushing over the bones. He\u2019s rubbing his own dripping erection against Castiel\u2019s thigh, leaving a little patch of wet that never gets a chance to dry before he\u2019s running over it again. It\u2019s driving Castiel to madness and Dean isn\u2019t even touching him where he wants it the most.</p>\n<p>Dean rises up and shuffles until he\u2019s kneeling between Castiel\u2019s legs. Without being asked or told, Castiel spreads his thighs wider and he\u2019s rewarded with a pleased grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Cas, there\u2019s so much I want to do to you I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnywhere, Dean. Just <em>do</em> <em>something</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises an eyebrow and his grin turns lascivious. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only warning Castiel gets before Dean\u2019s is licking a burning stripe up the length of his dick. Castiel cries out and his back bows, hips trying to press up against the downright <em>sinful</em> movements of Dean\u2019s tongue licking, tasting, swirling over him. Dean holds them down firmly and suckles at the head of his cock. He tongues the slit before taking Castiel fully into his mouth and sinking down.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s so much warm, wet, heat and Castiel is making noises that sound dangerously close to whimpering and he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s panting and scrabbling at the blankets until Dean reaches out and takes his hands. He guides them to the back of his head and Castiel\u2019s fingers are trembling as he runs them through Dean\u2019s hair. He presses gently, urging without words for more.</p>\n<p>Dean hums in approval and Castiel\u2019s body spasms, the vibrations sending tingling zigzags of pleasure everywhere. He\u2019s gasping and moaning and crying out Dean\u2019s name and he doesn\u2019t ever want it to stop. He thinks he might always want that soft, warm, wet mouth and the graze of teeth and the hollowed cheeks as Dean bobs along his length, working one hand over what he can\u2019t take.</p>\n<p>His other hand is roaming over his hips, his thighs, and brushing against his balls, stopping sometimes to cup them and roll them gently. Every touch is making the fire in his belly coil tighter and burn brighter and Castiel knows what\u2019s going to happen when it reaches the breaking point but he doesn\u2019t <em>know</em> what\u2019s going to <em>happen</em>. He\u2019s never felt this thrumming beneath his skin, this electricity that dances along his bones and makes his limbs twitch and his toes curl.</p>\n<p>Dean presses his thumb to a spot behind Castiel\u2019s balls and he rubs it firmly. It\u2019s like gasoline to the inferno boiling in his gut and it makes Castiel <em>writhe.</em> He\u2019s chanting Dean\u2019s name and he\u2019s not even sure if he\u2019s speaking English anymore and he doesn\u2019t <em>care</em>. His whole world has narrowed down to Dean and where he\u2019s touching him and when Dean pulls off his dick with a wet pop Castiel almost <em>cries.</em></p>\n<p>Dean shushes him with a hand over his mouth and one command. \u201cLick.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Castiel obeys. He coats Dean\u2019s palm and sucks on his fingers, working his tongue around the digits and biting at them softly when Dean pulls them away. Castiel thinks he knows what to expect next and he hitches his legs wider that extra little bit. It earns him an almost wistful smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry Cas, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna last long enough for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel doesn\u2019t pout, but it\u2019s a near thing. Instead, he watches as Dean reaches down with the hand he wetted for him. Dean strokes himself, thumb swiping over his leaking head and spreading the wetness along his length. Castiel licks his lips and he wants to know what Dean tastes like there too. \u00a0\u201cNext time, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean hips jerk forward and his response is lost in a gasp because Castiel is pressing the pad of his finger against the head of Dean\u2019s dick. He watches with wide eyes as Castiel rubs his finger over the sensitive crown, gathering the beading precome there. Dean outright <em>groans</em> when he brings his hand back to his lips and sucks his finger clean.</p>\n<p>Castiel is surprised when Dean rips his hand away and replaces his finger with his tongue. He\u2019s chasing his own taste and Castiel closes his eyes and lets him. He moans when he realizes the flavor on Dean\u2019s tongue is <em>his.</em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a hand under his thigh and he lets Dean guide his leg up until he understands what Dean wants. He hooks his leg around Dean\u2019s hips and Castiel chokes out a pleased groan when Dean finally presses down their hips together. Dean ruts against him with a few slow, measured thrusts that slide their cocks together in a delicious mix of wet and friction. Castiel wraps his arms around Dean\u2019s shoulders to keep him there.</p>\n<p>He wants Dean\u2019s kisses through the rest of this. He wants to see his face and eyes as Dean comes undone above him. Because of him. Because Dean is finding pleasure in the feel of Castiel\u2019s vessel and the sound of his voice.</p>\n<p>Dean\u2019s hand is on him again. It\u2019s on them both, squeezing and pumping in all the places Castiel didn\u2019t know were right. They thrust with erratic rolls of their hips into the tight tunnel of Dean\u2019s fingers until they find a rhythm that has Castiel whimpering and gasping and pleading into Dean\u2019s kisses.</p>\n<p>The fire has spread into Castiel\u2019s chest now. It\u2019s burning behind his ribs and through his stomach and deep into his gut. It\u2019s blazing down his legs and up into his arms and he\u2019s so <em>close</em> to something and he might be begging Dean to get him there because he doesn\u2019t know how to reach it. Dean knows. He leaves Castiel\u2019s lips despite Castiel\u2019s groan of disappointment and presses kisses along his jaw to his ear again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cas. I got\u2019cha.\u201d Dean drags his tongue over the sensitive skin under his ear. His voice is sandpaper rough and he\u2019s breathing almost as hard as Castiel is. \u201cLet <em>go.</em>\u201d He punctuates the order with the sharp sting of teeth.</p>\n<p>Castiel clutches at his handprint on Dean\u2019s shoulder and arches off the bed. His loud cry is drowned out by the ringing in his ears and he almost doesn\u2019t feel the splash of warmth on his stomach as he comes over Dean\u2019s fingers. The inferno raging under his skin ruptures his control and Castiel realizes it was never a fire. It\u2019s his <em>grace </em>that\u2019s burning. His wings rip out of the sub-space and everything goes white and <em>perfect</em> and Castiel hopes Dean noticed the signs and closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>Castiel comes back to the senses of his vessel slowly. His body feels heavy and satiated and content. His hand is still clamped firmly over Dean\u2019s shoulder. Dean is collapsed on top of him, trembling and breathing hard against his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cDean\u2026?\u201d His name comes out slurred.</p>\n<p>He stirs slightly and his back jerks in a huff of tired laughter. \u201cHoly fuckin\u2019 <em>Christ</em>. Warn a guy before you pull out the fireworks, Cas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I was just as surprised by it as you were.\u201d Castiel murmurs, trailing his fingers lightly over Dean\u2019s back, mapping the musculature. \u201cAre you alright? Did you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dean laughs again and rolls to the side. Castiel looks down at the sticky mess smeared over his belly. It\u2019s on Dean\u2019s hand too. He wonders if Dean would mind if he cleaned them with his \u2018mojo\u2019. Although he\u2019s very tempted to clean Dean\u2019s fingers with his tongue instead.</p>\n<p>He looks at him and Dean\u2019s eyes are barely open, a lazy, satisfied grin stretching his lips. \u201cM\u2019fine, Cas. And I did. I most <em>definitely</em> did. \u2018Bout the time you decided to pump up the angel juice and send it all right through this.\u201d He gestures limply at his left shoulder with his dirty hand and then frowns at the mess on it.</p>\n<p>In the space of one blink and the next, the mess is gone and Dean doesn\u2019t even look surprised. Instead, he wiggles his arm under Castiel\u2019s shoulders and pulls him tight against his side. Castiel can feel the press of lips against his temple and up to his hairline.</p>\n<p>Dean mumbles softly, almost drunkenly, into his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna move for the next week. I think grace-induced orgasms might be the best thing since\u2026 <em>ever.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel smiles and tentatively wraps his arm around Dean\u2019s chest. \u201cBetter than pie?\u201d</p>\n<p>He chuckles and hums in thought, but Castiel doesn\u2019t get an answer. Dean\u2019s breathing evens out into long, deep swells beneath Castiel\u2019s cheek. He smells of sweat and salt and the ever lingering tang of the impala\u2019s leather and metal. He smells like Dean and <em>home.</em></p>\n<p>Castiel fumbles blindly until he pulls the edge of the blanket up, folding it over them so Dean will stay warm. He curls as close as he can get and closes his eyes. He hasn\u2019t slept since those brief days before Stull when he was human, but he\u2019s content to lay here in the silence, the room lit by the street lamp through the window, while Dean sleeps.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">x</p>\n<p>Dean has been sleeping for nearly an hour when Castiel hears the rumble of the impala outside the house. He doesn\u2019t move from his place pressed along Dean\u2019s side, head on his shoulder and his cheek against the mark. He hears the key in the lock downstairs and he doesn\u2019t open his eyes.</p>\n<p>Sam and Charlie are talking as they come in. Castiel spares a brief moment of worry that they might wake Dean. He focuses a soft pulse of grace to ensure Dean remains sleeping and he listens to their conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he answering his cell yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Neither of them are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell where the heck could they be? Dean didn\u2019t even take his car. You gonna tell him you hotwired it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell no! And neither are you. As for where they are, your guess is as good as mi\u2013\u201d There is a heavy thud. \u201cOw! <em>Shit!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, genius. That would be the coffee table.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for that precious piece of information.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you just turn on a light already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Charlie</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already flicked the switch. The lights are burnt out or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the lights?\u201d Caution is creeping into Sam\u2019s tone.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence for a moment. \u201cYeah, even in the kitchen. It\u2019s not a power outage though, because the stove and microwave clocks are still on. I\u2019ve got some candles in the bedroom, be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice drops lower. \u201cEvery light in your house shouldn\u2019t be busted all at once. <em>Something</em> might be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel winces. That would be his fault. He\u2019ll tell Dean about it later and they can go shopping to replace all of Charlie\u2019s light bulbs. They should get her a gift too. Something as a thank you for the kick in the pants they needed.</p>\n<p>Charlie starts whispering too. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a flashlight app on your phone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUse it and stay behind me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Castiel hears the click of a gun being cocked. Their footsteps are light and near silent as they check the house. He could easily wing his way downstairs to tell them that it is only Dean and him here. But doing so would require leaving the warmth of Dean\u2019s side and that isn\u2019t something Castiel is willing to do. Now or ever.</p>\n<p>He can hear them coming up the stairs now and he turns his face, pressing his nose against Dean\u2019s neck. Castiel shifts that little bit closer and smiles when Dean\u2019s arm tightens around his shoulders. Dean makes a small snuffling noise but Castiel\u2019s small surge of grace keeps him from waking.</p>\n<p>There is brief wash of light against his eyelids, but Castiel doesn\u2019t react to it. There are two soft \u2018oh\u2019s. Charlie\u2019s exhalation doesn\u2019t end with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>come on</em>. Not in my frakkin\u2019 <em>bed!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>END</strong>\n</p>"
