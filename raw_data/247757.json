  "text": "<p>Charles had done some wedding planning consultations in some strange places -- in a hospital, at a chef\u2019s table in the middle of evening service, in an FBI interview room -- so outside the Sackler Wing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art wasn\u2019t completely ludicrous. In fact, he was maybe a little charmed that his latest client wanted to meet him in a public place, instead of throwing all his wealth at Charles in an ostentatious display, like so many of his peers did.</p>\n<p>Still, there was no mistaking the elegant figures of Sebastian Shaw and his fianc\u00e9e, Emma Frost, standing apart from the tourists and the security guards and the people who visited the Met on their lunch hour. Charles was belatedly glad that Raven had refused to let him go out the door in his customary tweed jacket with elbow patches.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Shaw, Ms. Frost,\u201d Charles said, stretching out his hand. \u201cCharles Xavier. How do you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Xavier, I\u2019ve heard so much about you,\u201d Shaw said, shaking his hand firmly.</p>\n<p>Charles smiled politely, and offered his hand to Frost as well, who shook his hand briefly and with some delicacy. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019ve heard of you. May I congratulate you on the completion of MacTaggert Wing?\u201d The MacTaggert Wing was a terrible Brutalist monstrosity grafted onto the Sinclair Gallery, but it didn\u2019t seem the time to air his architectural opinions.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll due to my lead architect, I assure you,\u201d Shaw said. His tone was warm, but there was something about him that Charles found unsettling. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business, shall we? You have quite a reputation for knowing just what a bride wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles smiled in Emma\u2019s direction. \u201cWe do our best,\u201d he said. She gave him a polite smile, something artificial but pretty enough, but when she looked at Shaw out of the corner of her eye, it transmuted into something a little more real, more graceless and giddy and true.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, perhaps we ought to start with the big picture -- how many guests were you thinking?\u201d Charles asked, following Shaw and Emma into the closed-off Sackler Wing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven hundred,\u201d Shaw said promptly.</p>\n<p>Charles did not raise his eyebrows, but settled for saying, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be challenging in terms of event space, but I\u2019m sure we can make something work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you do it in this space?\u201d Shaw asked.</p>\n<p>Charles looked around the gallery housing the Temple of Dendur, trying to do some mental calculations even with half the room obscured in white plastic and scaffolding. \u201cIn a room this size? Certainly. But I must be honest with you, Mr. Shaw, space like this is going to be hard to come by on such relatively short notice, and will almost certainly delay your desired wedding date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d Shaw said, smiling in his unsettling way again. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get married in a place like this. We actually want to get married here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles opened his mouth for a moment, and then shut it. \u201cMr. Shaw, please understand that I want to make this day everything the both of you want, but there are some limits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, if it\u2019s access you\u2019re worried about, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Shaw said breezily. \u201cMy firm is renovating this wing. I\u2019m certain it can be made available for our use before the re-opening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wonderful,\u201d Charles said, hoping his smile adequately concealed his anxiety.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven hundred guests. In the <i>Metropolitan Museum of Art</i>. In a wing that is the process of being renovated, so who knows when it will actually be ready. You may as well just set me on fire now and get it over with,\u201d Charles moaned to Raven.</p>\n<p>She put a cup of coffee down in front of him, and he took a sip. It was terrible -- Raven\u2019s coffee was always terrible -- but he couldn\u2019t really face life without more caffeine and so he drank it anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our big break,\u201d Raven said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done pretty well until now, but this is going to open so many doors for us, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles put his head down in his arms. \u201cI just want to make people happy,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, you can always go back to living off your trust fund and sleeping with Tony Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Charles said. \u201cI thought you forbade me to sleep with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, and for your own good,\u201d Raven said. \u201cSo don\u2019t screw this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Ugh</i>,\u201d Charles said, and drank his coffee in misery.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Shaw secured some kind of terrifying pass for him to get into the Sackler Wing whenever Charles wanted, even though it was closed to the public and security made terrible faces at Charles when he first showed the card to them. Inside, the scaffolding had seemingly bred like rabbits -- what were they even <i>doing</i> -- and there were people in hard hats who didn\u2019t seem to be working so much as pointing at things vigorously and talking a lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d someone said behind Charles, voice authoritative and sharp with German consonants.</p>\n<p>Charles clutched his pass in his hand, and turned around to explain himself, and then utterly failed to do so, because the man behind him had stern eyes and sterner cheekbones, and wore his perfectly tailored suit as easily as breathing. \u201cEr,\u201d Charles said.</p>\n<p>The man looked completely unimpressed. He had an iPad in one hand, with which he made a short shooing gesture. \u201cThis wing is closed for renovations,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got in, but you need to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Charles said, finally recovering himself enough to drag his pass up into the man\u2019s line of sight. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be here. I\u2019m Charles Xavier--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re God Almighty,\u201d the man interrupted. \u201cOut. Or I\u2019ll have you escorted out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Charles said. \u201cPlease listen to me, I\u2019m a wedding planner--\u201d</p>\n<p>The man looked heavenward and then seized Charles by the elbow. \u201cI really don\u2019t care--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--and I\u2019m working for Mr. Shaw,\u201d Charles finished, feeling as if he\u2019d run out of breath all at once.</p>\n<p>The hand on his elbow tightened, and the man drew him just a little closer, staring at Charles as if he could verify this information if he looked intently enough. Charles was so close he could smell the man\u2019s aftershave and see the suspicious narrowing of his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to solve this,\u201d the man said finally. He pulled his phone out of his pocket, and Charles heard the phone ring on speaker.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d came the voice of Sebastian Shaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a wedding planner?\u201d the man said flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes. Xavier. He should be down there sometime today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d the man demanded crossly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been married three times already. Don\u2019t you know how to do it by now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLehnsherr,\u201d Shaw said, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a chastisement. \u201cSome things are better left to professionals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr\u2019s once-over of Charles made his opinion of Charles\u2019 profession abundantly clear. \u201cI won\u2019t have outsiders underfoot in my renovation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Xavier will be perfectly cooperative,\u201d Shaw said, and the way he said it made Charles feel infinitely filthier than any time spent in Tony Stark\u2019s company, which was really saying something. \u201cPlay nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr hung up then, which Charles thought was pretty ballsy for a subordinate, but Lehnsherr didn\u2019t look remotely concerned. He did let go of Charles, although he had the gall to straighten Charles\u2019 lapel just so. \u201cYou\u2019ll wear a hard hat at all times,\u201d Lehnsherr said. \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of being sued for liability just because you didn\u2019t want to muss your hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles looked at him in disbelief, and then took a deep breath. \u201cLook, I think we\u2019ve gotten off on the wrong foot. Perhaps we could get a cup of coffee and--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Xavier,\u201d Lehnsherr said coolly, using polite social distance like a lance, \u201cI have neither the time nor the inclination. Be here if Shaw says you must, but stay out of my way.\u201d He turned away, the heels of his shoes clicking across the gallery floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Charles said to himself, \u201cthis is going to go very well indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Charles had every intention of staying out of Lehnsherr\u2019s way, except that it quickly became evident that he couldn\u2019t rely on the past layout of the Sackler Wing for the wedding. He only had two months to pull off the most elaborate wedding of his career, and he didn\u2019t have any time to lose.</p>\n<p>And because Charles hadn\u2019t gotten to where he was without knowing a thing or two about how to butter someone up, he went back to the Sackler with two coffees in hand from a coffee shop run by an Austrian couple, put on a too-big hard hat and went off in search of Erik Lehnsherr.</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr had blueprints in one hand, his iPad tucked under his arm, and had clearly just finished conferencing with a group of men who were departing, presumably to do his will. He spotted Charles and his mouth creased into an unfriendly line, but Charles persevered.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Lehnsherr,\u201d Charles said, offering a smile that Raven had told him had probably saved him from being punched any number of times. \u201cIf I could have a few moments?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he sniffed the air instead, and said, \u201cIs that from Elsa\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles handed a cup to him, and Lehnsherr took one long, appreciative sip, and then said, \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Charles said, and looked out over the gallery, obscured by plastic and scaffolding and god knew what else. \u201cI -- do you suppose I could have a copy of those blueprints?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was possible that both the coffee and the smile were working, because Lehnsherr only frowned severely and said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI may not have your extensive training, Mr. Lehnsherr, but surely I can divine a layout and electric outlets,\u201d Charles said, fighting to keep a smile on his face.</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr took another thoughtful sip of coffee. \u201cAnd if you make a critical error, what impact will that have on the wedding?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles bristled at the insinuation.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is no place for amateurs, Mr. Xavier,\u201d Lehnsherr said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the blueprints on the condition that you don\u2019t let your arrogance prevent you from asking questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy <i>arrogance</i>?\u201d Charles said, genuinely taken aback.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour naivet\u00e9, perhaps,\u201d Lehnsherr allowed, and the cool disdain in his voice raised all of Charles\u2019 hackles. \u201cYou swan into my renovation and demand the fruits of six months of my labor, confident that you can visualize and understand what I\u2019m doing with no formal training whatsoever?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles licked his lips once, and took a calming breath. \"You wouldn't be the first man to find no value in my work, but I assure you that I take both it and my clients' happiness very seriously.\"</p>\n<p>\"Happiness,\" Lehnsherr echoed, as if tasting the word in his mouth and not being entirely certain what to make of it.</p>\n<p>\"Please, Mr. Lehnsherr,\" Charles said softly.</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr abruptly handed Charles his coffee. \"Give me your email address,\" he said, bringing up his iPad. His long fingers tapped on the screen for a few moments. Without looking up, he said, \"And call me Erik.\"</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Raven coordinated the wedding dress shopping, thank the good lord. Charles had only once gone to an appointment with one of the exclusive bridal designers in the city, and the experience had been full of so much terribleness and crying and violently ugly couture that Charles had henceforth assigned himself to only bargain basement shopping if the bride so desired. His TJ Maxx skills were pretty astonishing, if he said so himself.</p>\n<p>The Shaw-Frost wedding was, happily enough, not the only event on their plate, which boded well for the continued success and growth of Xavier Events. There were three other, smaller weddings coming up, a bar mitzvah in a month, and an imminent retirement party that was already making Raven hyperventilate.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s eighty-six and just <i>now</i> retiring from Columbia,\u201d Raven said. \u201cWho does that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA man who clearly enjoys his work,\u201d Charles said, punctuating his words by scribbling down a few more notes on his preliminary catering menu. \u201cIn another life, I think I might have done the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou certainly dress for it,\u201d Raven said, but it was an old, affectionate jibe that Charles paid no mind. She stopped typing on her laptop, then, and looked at Charles pensively. \u201cDo you wish you had?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a note of uncertainty in her voice that he hadn\u2019t heard in quite a while.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaven,\u201d Charles said, reaching forward to cover her hand with his, \u201cI\u2019m happy right where I am, with you, working together. I wouldn\u2019t trade my life for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled, and Charles did her the favor of pretending that her eyes weren\u2019t watery, and that he was being entirely truthful.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Charles had planned his mother\u2019s second wedding, mostly because there was no one else to do it, and he\u2019d read a few magazines and decided he could handle it.</p>\n<p>Also, it had made his mother smile, which she did rarely, even in the company of her fianc\u00e9.</p>\n<p>It had been a small wedding at the mansion in Westchester, and his mother was so weak from the chemo that she had to sit during the whole ceremony. Charles had picked out her dress, which mostly camouflaged how thin she\u2019d grown, and the wig was a good approximation of her formerly lustrous golden curls.</p>\n<p>Charles remembered the mistakes -- the cake had been dry, the food not as good as he\u2019d hoped -- but he remembered most how truly happy his mother had looked when she\u2019d said her vows.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d died six months later, and his stepfather had followed two years after that, and left Raven and Charles alone together. Charles had been planning on Oxford, but he couldn\u2019t leave Raven behind. He\u2019d gone to Columbia instead, and their business had been hatched during his first year. A degree in genetics would have been all very well and good, but the first time Charles saw a bride beam at a wedding he had planned, he could only see his mother in her smile. After that, genetics could hardly compare.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hank and Alex were young, but tremendously talented, and just as a few people had done Charles a good turn while Xavier Events was getting off the ground, Charles wanted to nurture their fledgling catering business. Also, they made a salmon appetizer that was like a mouth orgasm every time Charles ate it, so he figured it was a good bet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like them,\u201d he assured Emma. \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing a tasting menu today so that you can make some decisions. If you don\u2019t care for them, we can use one of the approved caterers, but I think they\u2019re worth persuading the Met to let us use them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emma nodded, and Charles tried not to sigh. She didn\u2019t talk very much, and Charles worried that she either had no opinion or was suffering this exercise mutely. He didn\u2019t like either possibility.</p>\n<p>Hank and Alex had come through once again, though, and had even prepared extra salmon.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, really, you have to try this one, I insist,\u201d Charles said, pushing it Emma\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>She tried it, and her eyes went wide, fingers fluttering in front of her mouth like she would say something if it wouldn\u2019t require her to talk with her mouth full.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Charles said, waggling his eyebrows before popping the salmon in his mouth and making a really indecent noise that made Hank go red in the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Emma said, looking doubtfully at all of the demolished sample plates. \u201cWhat should I pick?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles looked at his notes. \u201cWell, you liked the salmon, obviously, but I think the mushroom and the liver pate will be good accompanying hors d\u2019oeuvres.\u201d He looked up again, and Emma\u2019s mouth was twisted into an unhappy frown, even as she twisted her engagement ring with its ludicrously large diamonds on her finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint anyone,\u201d she said, voice low.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Charles said carefully, \u201cwhat about what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked even more miserably indecisive, and Charles could tell it was going to be a very long afternoon.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Lehnsherr -- <i>Erik</i>, Charles reminded himself -- looked distinctly displeased to see him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the city inspector,\u201d Erik said shortly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Charles said lightly, handing Erik a coffee from Elsa\u2019s. \u201cLate, I take it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik looked so fantastically grim and murderous that Charles would laugh if he didn\u2019t think that Erik would strangle him for it. \u201cForty-five minutes late, and everything\u2019s waiting on him. That man is the devil,\u201d Erik said savagely, and sipped his coffee with a scowl.</p>\n<p>Charles tried very hard not to watch the line of his throat as he swallowed, and failed miserably.</p>\n<p>\u201cI assume you didn\u2019t come here just to bring me coffee,\u201d Erik said.</p>\n<p>Privately, Charles thought a little thanks wouldn\u2019t go amiss, but he said mildly, \u201cI had a question about the fountain, actually. Do you think I could put lights in the water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Erik said instantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Charles accused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to think about it, because you\u2019re not doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles straightened to his full height, which was unfortunately still a head shorter than Erik. \u201cLook, I understand that you may be in a bit of a mood--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA mood?\u201d Erik said, all silky threat, too close and looming.</p>\n<p>Charles lifted up his chin. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik narrowed his eyes. \u201cI thought you promised Shaw you were going to be cooperative.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I thought you promised him you were going to <i>play nice</i>,\u201d Charles shot back.</p>\n<p>There was a sudden clatter of sound from the gallery entrance, and they both looked over to see a red-faced man in a bland suit -- and judging by all the sour looks from the rest of the workers, he could only be the overdue city inspector.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Erik said, and started to walk toward the inspector.</p>\n<p>Charles had to hustle to catch up to Erik\u2019s long-legged stride. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re really going to think about it, or are you just going to blow me off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Erik said, voice pitched for his ears alone, \u201cWhen I blow you off, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d He handed Charles his empty cup then. \u201cThanks for the coffee,\u201d he said, and then left Charles behind to greet the city inspector with a cool smile that managed to disguise the part where Erik probably still wanted to have the man drawn and quartered.</p>\n<p>Charles stood there for a few moments, still holding the two empty coffee cups, before he decided that regrouping was the order of the day.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is an unmitigated <i>ass</i>,\u201d Charles ranted a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did the famous Erik Lehnsherr do today? Tell me everything,\u201d Raven said, which might have been sarcasm except that she was pouring them both extremely generous glasses of wine and had never disguised the joy she took in Charles\u2019 social flailings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked him a perfectly simple question about ventilation and the fire alarm system--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you need to know that?\u201d Raven said suspiciously.</p>\n<p>Charles lifted his chin with righteous anger. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he said, and where does he get off criticizing my ideas? Just because a person has some creative passion in his soul doesn\u2019t make him <i>wrong</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I might actually have to go with Lehnsherr on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d Charles said, and took a sip of wine that was really more of a gulp.</p>\n<p>Raven put her feet in his lap. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, remember Mrs. Schwartz\u2019s thing with the candles--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we agreed never to talk about that again,\u201d Charles huffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Raven said cheerfully. \u201cSo, in conclusion: Erik Lehnsherr doesn\u2019t want you to burn down the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also, you want him real bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI most certainly do <i>not</i>,\u201d Charles said, completely horrified.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>So far, that morning, Charles had fielded no less than six phone calls from Emma Frost, all in regard to the wedding cake, and so he was not precisely at his best when he arrived at the Met for his appointment with Shaw\u2019s security expert.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, are you <i>smoking</i> in here?\u201d Charles said, horrified by the scruffy man in plaid lingering outside the door to the Sackler Wing. \u201cPut that out <i>at once</i>, this is a museum, what are you thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man looked completely bemused by Charles\u2019 outrage, but obediently stubbed out the cigar on the back of his shoe.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve made me late,\u201d Charles muttered, and looked around in vain for someone who probably had impossibly broad shoulders and a terrible suit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou Charles Xavier?\u201d the man said.</p>\n<p>Charles looked at him suspiciously. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>He held out his hand. \u201cLogan. Mr. Shaw sent me here to go over things with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles shifted the bag in his hands and decoration samples to free himself to shake his hand. \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Logan,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust Logan,\u201d he said. He gave Charles a look up and down. \u201cNice purse,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I beg your pardon</i>,\u201d Charles said, all of his outrage back.</p>\n<p>Logan grinned then, and it was surprisingly charming even though Charles knew that meant Logan had just been fucking with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, walk me through this shindig,\u201d Logan said, pulling the door open and ushering Charles through -- with a hand on the small of his back, good Christ.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Logan had some admittedly excellent suggestions about crowd control in between horrifying Charles with off-handed comments about snipers.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Logan, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to assassinate Mr. Shaw,\u201d Charles said firmly.</p>\n<p>Logan raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve met him, right? Ain\u2019t nobody who\u2019s met him that hasn\u2019t wanted to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting <i>married</i>,\u201d Charles said defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the fourth time. Like I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are <i>you</i> doing here?\u201d Erik said from behind them, sounding very cross indeed.</p>\n<p>Charles and Logan turned. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be here, as you\u2019ll recall,\u201d Charles said, affronted.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Erik said, stepping close. He looked down at Charles and his lips quirked into something that verged on disappointment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring me coffee today?\u201d</p>\n<p>And it was completely stupid -- Charles had only started bringing coffee to sweeten Erik\u2019s disposition a little, to at least associate Charles\u2019 visits with something he liked. It was social bribery, and therefore there was no good reason for Charles to feel guilty at having let Erik down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI--I thought I might be able to persuade you to come out for coffee with me. After we\u2019re done here,\u201d Charles said, the invitation out of his mouth before he could think better of it.</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s gaze was considering, and then he looked sharply at Logan. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain what Shaw\u2019s pit bull is doing here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust doing my job, Lehnsherr,\u201d Logan said, giving him a smile that was all teeth.</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s lip curled, and Logan\u2019s frankly terrifying grin got wider, and Charles was honestly worried that violence was a real possibility. He touched Erik\u2019s elbow to get his attention. \u201cWe\u2019ll be done in about ten minutes. Can you spare me some time then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik didn\u2019t shake him off, surprisingly enough. \u201cTen minutes,\u201d he said, and then aimed one last glare at Logan before stalking off in the direction of some of his employees.</p>\n<p>Charles and Logan watched him go, and then Logan let out a low whistle. \u201cYou some kind of miracle worker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to say I\u2019ve been called that on occasion, but I don\u2019t see how it applies here,\u201d Charles said.</p>\n<p>Logan let out of a huff of a disbelieving laugh. \u201cLehnsherr wouldn\u2019t spit on a man if he were on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Charles said uncertainly. \u201cBy which I mean, I agree with that assessment entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Logan said, tilting his head in Erik\u2019s direction -- Erik, who was still watching them even as he talked to a foreman.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just worried I\u2019m going to burn the museum down,\u201d Charles said.</p>\n<p>Logan snorted. \u201cSure he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Erik came back precisely ten minutes later and chased Logan away, before escorting Charles out of the museum. It was a crisp autumn day outside, and a beautiful morning for a walk.</p>\n<p>Erik didn\u2019t say much as they walked, but he was looking at the buildings as they passed with an assessing eye, before coming to a stop outside Elsa\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Charles said. \u201cWe could go someplace else if you wanted. I only -- it was just clear. That you liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you pay attention to what people like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be good at my job if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Charles said wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does a person even become a wedding planner?\u201d Erik said, claiming a table and ordering them both coffee and something else in low, angular German without looking at the menu.</p>\n<p>Charles raised an eyebrow but forbore commenting on Erik\u2019s presumption. \u201cPerhaps you ought to tell me how you become an architect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI earned my Masters of Urban Design from ETH Zurich,\u201d Erik said. \u201cAnd then I came here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles smiled encouragingly, but Erik didn\u2019t seem to feel the need to elaborate. Their order came then, coffee cups and some sort of cookies on twin stainless steel servers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you enjoy it?\u201d Charles asked, before taking a bite of one of the cookies. He made a shocked, indecent noise at the combination of almond paste and raspberry and chocolate.</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s eyes lingered on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles sipped his coffee to wash the crumbs down. \u201cAm I allowed to ask you terribly clich\u00e9d questions, like what your favorite building here is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Citigroup Center,\u201d Erik said blandly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh dear god <i>why</i>,\u201d Charles said, entirely unable to help himself.</p>\n<p>But clearly, Erik was having him on, because his mouth twitched into something that suggested a smile. \u201cNot really -- that thing is as ugly as sin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles kicked him lightly in the foot. \u201cI was about to think terribly of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you think terribly of me if I tell you that my favorite is the Chrysler building?\u201d Erik asked, something a little more intimate, almost confessional in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody says that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it less true,\u201d Erik said, and handed Charles the little plate of cookies off his own tray.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t, those are yours,\u201d Charles said, still a little astonished that his plateful had disappeared so quickly.</p>\n<p>Erik pushed them into his hand anyway. \u201cYou may as well. I have to get back to the museum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Charles said, and nearly winced at how plaintive he sounded.</p>\n<p>Erik put a crisp twenty on the table and stood. \u201cWe\u2019re getting down to the wire, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware. Unless you don\u2019t want the Shaw wedding to go as planned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say things like that, it does alarming things to my blood pressure,\u201d Charles scolded.</p>\n<p>Erik brushed his fingers against Charles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cSee you around, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil then,\u201d Charles said reflexively.</p>\n<p>Charles thought for approximately five seconds about taking the rest of the cookies home to Raven, but he was sure they wouldn\u2019t be as good at the end of the day, so really, he had no choice but to eat them.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The Pennington wedding was over, as was the retirement party, which was good, because the Shaw-Frost wedding went from minor shitshow to DEFCON HOT FUCKING MESS in the space of ten minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmma,\u201d Charles said carefully, refraining from making any stabbing motions on the phone, \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to accuse me of being a gold-digger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much I -- it doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to say, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles sighed. \u201cThey may, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about tongues wagging. People will say what they want. The important question here is, what do you want? If you say you\u2019d rather have a small wedding with family only, I will make that happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after everything you\u2019ve done?\u201d Emma asked doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven then, if it\u2019s what you really want,\u201d Charles said. Something was niggling at him, though, and so he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the potential gossip that\u2019s bothering you, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEmma, it\u2019s normal to be nervous,\u201d Charles says, trying very hard to sound soothing and not patronizing. \u201cWeddings, no matter the size, are a nerve-wracking business. Why don\u2019t you take the weekend to think it over?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence at the other end, and then a noisy exhale. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll just -- I\u2019ll call you on Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Charles lied neatly, and resigned himself to a weekend of waiting on tenterhooks.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know what she wants?\u201d Raven demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You know what everyone says about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I\u2019m abnormally patient while my sister is haranguing me?\u201d Charles said, rubbing his temples in a slow, circular motion.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>They say</i>,\u201d Raven ground out, \u201cthat it\u2019s like you\u2019re fucking <i>psychic</i> and you always know what the bride really wants, even if she doesn\u2019t. Charles, you\u2019ve got to pull it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand how important this is for us, Raven. I just can\u2019t get a read on her, for some reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re distracted,\u201d Raven said flatly. \u201cMaybe if you spent a little less time making doe-eyes at Erik Lehnsherr and a little more time listening to Emma, you\u2019d have this figured out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles took in a sharp breath and counted to ten, and then said evenly, \u201cYou really think you\u2019re one to talk about distractions of a personal nature, Raven?\u201d</p>\n<p>She went red, not a pink, embarrassed blush but an angry, blotchy red. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare, Charles.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could make a case that Raven had nearly cost them a lucrative catering contact when she\u2019d taken up with Hank and then, just as abruptly, broken his heart, but he held his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d she said after a tense, terrible moment, and Charles didn\u2019t call after her.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He met Emma for breakfast on Monday morning, and over coffee and a passable souffl\u00e9, he made small talk until he thought they were ready to tackle more emotional topics.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, what non-wedding things have you been up to in the last two weeks?\u201d Charles asked.</p>\n<p>Emma dabbed at her lips. \u201cWork, mostly. I handle a lot of contracts for the city -- that\u2019s how I met Sebastian.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles rested his chin on his hand. \u201cSwept you off your feet, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p>And there was that smile again, the one that Charles had been waiting to see. \u201cI didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t used to think that really happened. That you could just meet someone, and -- you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles didn\u2019t know, exactly, but he\u2019d seen enough people in love -- and enough people who were close enough to round up to being in love -- that he recognized the signs. But he also recognized something else. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me an intrusive question, but how did Sebastian propose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Emma twisted the rather overdone ring on her finger. \u201cHe -- he came into the office, actually. I thought he was just taking me to lunch, but he proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeavens, in front of all your coworkers?\u201d Charles said, taking care to keep his tone light. But a public workplace proposal said two things to Charles -- one, that Sebastian Shaw had been confident in her reply, and two, that Emma hadn\u2019t really had a chance to think it over in private before accepting.</p>\n<p>Emma\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cIt was a joke around the office -- that he was just trying to sweeten me up for the contracts to go through. It shut everyone up when he proposed.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Charles would lay money that it hadn\u2019t shut up Emma\u2019s doubts. No <i>wonder</i> she was dragging her feet now.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmma, if you still want to make changes to the size and scope of the wedding, we can do that. But I think you need to do something first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you need to have a talk with Sebastian. A real talk, about all of thing things you\u2019ve been pushing aside. I know you love him, but you\u2019ll never rest easy until you get everything out in the open.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emma opened her mouth, presumably to protest that she hadn\u2019t been suppressing anything, and then shut it. And that didn\u2019t surprise Charles at all, because it was what he\u2019d known from the beginning -- Emma\u2019s edges might have been blunted by emotion, but underneath it, she was sharp and smart and he knew she\u2019d pin Sebastian down the first chance she had. She\u2019d just needed a little nudge.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me after you\u2019ve talked,\u201d Charles said, laying his napkin next to his empty plate. \u201cAnd good luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Charles ended up back at the Met, because either he was totally fucked or this thing was still going forward, and if it was going forward, he needed to go over reception service with Hank.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promised me you wouldn\u2019t freak out,\u201d Charles reminded him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not freaking out, I\u2019m wondering how we\u2019re going to coordinate that many servers,\u201d Hank said, carefully wiping his glasses off in a bid to demonstrate that he was not freaking out when he so obviously <i>was</i>.</p>\n<p>Something gently tapped against Charles\u2019 head -- when he looked back to see what it was, Erik was holding a hard hat that he had apparently just thunked against Charles\u2019 skull. \u201cI wasn\u2019t actually joking when I told you to wear one of these,\u201d he said gruffly, settling it on Charles\u2019 head. He tossed the other to Hank.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy brain is already soft,\u201d Charles muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t see that getting clobbered is going to hurt me, at this juncture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"I may have just talked Emma out of going through with the wedding,\" Charles said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to go through with it,\u201d Hank said, and then to Erik, \u201cCharles is basically the bride whisperer. It\u2019s like he can read their minds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBride whisperer,\u201d Erik repeated flatly, but he looked very much like he was trying not to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop talking, Hank,\u201d Charles suggested, scowling. He turned back to Erik, and said, \u201cCan I test the sound equipment this afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik shook his head. \u201cNot today. Maybe tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles would have tugged at his hair if it weren\u2019t currently covered by a hard hat. If he couldn\u2019t get it done today, he\u2019d have to push back his meeting with the DJ, which was going push another six things back, and rescheduling was going to be almost impossible. Not to mention, <i>they only had five days until the wedding</i>.</p>\n<p>A warm hand squeezed his shoulder. \u201cCharles?\u201d Erik said, eyes narrowing in something like concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just going to hyperventilate,\u201d Hank said helpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat happened <i>once</i>,\u201d Charles said, but took a few deep breaths anyway. And then his phone vibrated in his pocket. When he took it out, there was a text from Emma.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething up?\u201d Hank asked, shifting his weight from one foot to the other and still looking nervous in general.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe wedding\u2019s on,\u201d Charles said slowly, not entirely able to believe it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBride whisperer strikes again,\u201d Hank said reverently, and Charles felt totally justified in smacking him upside his hard-hatted head.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Charles waited until the workers went home for the evening, and then managed to slip into the Sackler Wing. He didn\u2019t even have to flash his badge -- a security guard who was obviously on his way out for the night recognized Charles and waved him through.</p>\n<p>He was in luck, because the door to the newly installed sound booth was open. There were plenty of wires all over the place, but Charles had worked with AV setups more chaotic than this. At least this sound booth was clearly state-of-the-art, and not dodgy wiring held together with duct tape and a prayer.</p>\n<p>The door to the booth clicked shut behind him, and Charles jumped, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did I know?\u201d Erik said wryly. \u201cI tell you not to do something, and you do it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on a schedule,\u201d Charles said. \u201cAnd you told me not to do it this afternoon, which is why I am here when normal people might be thinking about a nightcap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you not to do it <i>today</i>, which actually still includes now,\u201d Erik said, tone disapproving.</p>\n<p>Charles turned sharply to look at him, and promptly lost his footing on some of the wiring. He pitched forward and saw what looked like a very important cable being ripped out of the wall, and that was when there was a terrible noise and everything went dark.</p>\n<p>There was the click of the door handle, and then a scuffling noise like a push. \u201cWe\u2019re locked in,\u201d Erik said, his tone clipped.</p>\n<p>Charles dug out his phone, momentarily filling the sound booth with some light. \u201cNo signal. You?\u201d</p>\n<p>Another flash of light and a disgusted noise. \u201cNot this far into the interior of the museum. Especially not this corridor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bugger</i>,\u201d Charles said feelingly, and slid down the wall to sit on the floor.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Erik didn\u2019t actually castigate him for getting into this mess, but he did tell Charles to shove over so that he could sit down next to him.</p>\n<p>Which was fine, because Charles was plenty capable of castigating himself. \u201cWhy do I do these things to myself? I could be doing any one of the approximately six billion items on my to-do list, but no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr you could be sleeping,\u201d Erik said.</p>\n<p>Charles scoffed. \u201cPlease. There\u2019s no sleeping a week before a wedding like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was completely dark in sound booth, but Erik\u2019s assurances of proper ventilation and the warm press of Erik\u2019s body all along his left side went a long way toward preventing any panic attacks. All his senses had to focus on was the steady movement of Erik\u2019s breathing and the increasing rasp of his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even like this wedding?\u201d Erik asked suddenly.</p>\n<p>Charles squirmed a bit, his backside starting to go numb. \u201cLike it?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a pause while Erik thought it over, and then he said slowly, \u201cIs it the kind of wedding you would want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles snorted. \u201cOh good lord, no. Weddings like these are about public spectacle, about demonstrating power and wealth.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a hum of agreement from Erik. \u201cI\u2019ve been to all three of Shaw\u2019s previous weddings. They were all like this, a gaudy circus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles\u2019 lips twitched into a smile he knew Erik couldn\u2019t see, but could probably hear in his voice. \u201cWatch whose work you\u2019re calling a \u2018gaudy circus,\u2019 Erik.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re implying anything about the refurb on this wing, I\u2019ll have you know that I had to design under some very strict parameters not of my own choosing,\u201d Erik said coolly.</p>\n<p>Charles reached over to pat Erik\u2019s knee in consolation, but misjudged and ended up sort of feeling up his thigh. It was distressingly well-muscled and suggested Erik probably ran a fair amount. \u201cI knew that. But there are still parts of you in it, aren\u2019t there? The columns on the side and the glasswork, I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik was silent for a long moment. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man who loves the beautiful details and the sleekness of the Chrysler building. There\u2019s nothing of Shaw\u2019s overwrought aesthetic there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik seemed to relax a little, body settling more comfortably against Charles. Which was just as well, because it was distinctly on the chilly side inside the sound booth, cool air being over-efficiently pumped into the room. He was entirely unable to prevent the shiver that wracked his body -- Raven had often called him a delicate, climate-controlled flower, which was unfortunately pretty accurate.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold?\u201d Erik asked. Charles was uncertain whether he was being patronized, but Erik just said, \u201cHere, let me--\u201d and then wrapped one warm arm firmly around Charles\u2019 shoulders, pulling him closer still.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Charles said skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m not a girl, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik\u2019s breath teased at his ear. \u201cI\u2019m quite aware.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the rearrangement of their bodies, Charles hadn\u2019t exactly let go of Erik\u2019s thigh -- and in fact, his grip had slid further away from Erik\u2019s knee, to the point where if he moved his hand just a little more, he\u2019d have incontrovertible evidence that Erik was most definitely not a girl, either. Charles swallowed, feeling like his throat had gone dry.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles,\u201d Erik murmured, his lips -- oh god -- brushing Charles\u2019 ear, and Charles couldn\u2019t help the thready sigh he made, the shiver running down his spine that had nothing to do with the temperature.</p>\n<p>Erik froze against him for one terrible moment, and then he deliberately licked the curl of Charles\u2019 ear before taking the lobe in between sharp teeth, and the moan that Charles made at that couldn\u2019t leave anyone in the booth with any doubt that he was ripe for the taking.</p>\n<p>The next moments were madness, a blur of sucking kisses against Charles\u2019 too-sensitive neck that left him gasping before Erik relented and pressed their lips together, and that made things more out of control, not less, and all he could do was open his mouth to Erik and suck on his tongue and make more of those terribly unmanly gasps when Erik nibbled at his lips and tried to press their bodies closer still. The angle was awkward, though, and giving him a bit of a crick in his neck, so the only answer -- obviously -- was to raise himself up on his knees and swing one thigh over to straddle Erik\u2019s lap, and, <i>oh</i>, there was his proof that Erik wanted him very much, indeed.</p>\n<p>He ground his hips down in Erik\u2019s lap, moving his hips in a tight, slow circle that had Erik gasping against Charles\u2019 mouth for a change, and he was hard and hot against Charles, still in that damnably sleek suit that Charles wanted nothing more than to wrinkle up, even if he couldn\u2019t see it. Erik evidently felt likewise, because he made short work of the buttons on Charles\u2019 cardigan before pulling it off and shoving his hands up Charles\u2019 shirt to skate over his ribs and rub against his nipples. \u201cOh god,\u201d Charles breathed, and he was just at the right height now to learn forward to learn the strong slope of Erik\u2019s neck with his lips, and felt Erik push his hips up when Charles lingered on the tender patch of skin under his ear.</p>\n<p>And then Erik was scrambling to open their belts, like he couldn\u2019t <i>wait</i>, and Charles obviously couldn\u2019t wait either, because he kept rubbing against Erik even though it was obviously impeding Erik\u2019s progress toward getting their trousers open, and Erik said something low and impatient in German, before succeeding in dragging Charles\u2019 waistband down and getting a good handful of his ass through what Charles belatedly realized were not his everyday underwear.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a crime that I can\u2019t see these on you,\u201d Erik said vehemently before yanking them down.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould turn on your phone,\u201d Charles said, popping the button on Erik\u2019s trousers and undoing the zip with triumph, before raising himself up on his knees again so that Erik could lift his hips enough for Charles to shimmy everything out of the way.</p>\n<p>Erik growled something in reply, and Charles didn\u2019t care what it was, because Erik curled his large, square palm around the both of them and all Charles could do was clutch at his shoulders and ride his lap while Erik stroked them together. They were both already a little slick, but Charles pulled Erik\u2019s hand up to drag his tongue wetly over Erik\u2019s palm and fingers before pushing it back down, and Erik said, \u201c<i>Fuck</i>, Charles,\u201d before stroking them together in earnest.</p>\n<p>And since Charles was the precise opposite of subtle when there was something he wanted in bed, he writhed shamelessly to meet the exploring finger that Erik was drawing down from the small of his back, and Erik only pulled it away to press it against Charles\u2019 lips, and Charles sucked his finger in, going down on it like he would go down on Erik\u2019s cock if they only had the room to maneuver, and then Erik drew his hand away and let his spit-slick finger rub against Charles\u2019 hole before gently pushing in. Or at least, he probably meant to go gently, slowly, except that Charles moaned and thrust back greedily, and Erik ground out, \u201c<i>Liebling</i>, the things I want to do to you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, <i>fuck me</i>,\u201d Charles begged, and he didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d ever been cold, not with Erik\u2019s hand wrapped around them and his finger tapping out a maddening rhythm against Charles\u2019 prostate, their skin hot and damp with sweat where it touched around their rucked-up shirts.</p>\n<p>Charles reached down to touch Erik\u2019s cock, to feel the heft of him, and moaned against Erik\u2019s lips, \u201cI want this, I want all of this, <i>Erik</i>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Erik promised, voice a gritty rasp. \u201cLater, <i>Schatz</i>, I\u2019m going to open you up so slow and give it to you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>, oh, oh <i>god</i>,\u201d Charles gasped out, forehead resting on Erik\u2019s shoulder as he came all over Erik\u2019s hand, shuddering when Erik slowly fingered him through the end. \u201cAh -- no more, let me--\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik eased his finger out, and Charles swept his hand through his own come and wrapped it firmly around Erik\u2019s cock, stroking him quickly. He thought Erik was close, so Charles murmured in his ear, \u201cYou will, won\u2019t you, you\u2019ll fuck me so well you\u2019ll <i>ruin</i> me for anyone else, I\u2019ll only want you--\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik gripped his hips hard, then, shaking apart in Charles\u2019 grasp.</p>\n<p>Charles slumped forward in Erik\u2019s arms, both of them trying to catch their breath. \u201cGood lord, Erik,\u201d Charles said eventually, still feeling dazed.</p>\n<p>Erik just ran his fingers soothingly up and down Charles\u2019 spine, and then after a time, he said, \u201cI bet you can sleep now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles made a dissatisfied noise. \u201cI\u2019d love to, but there\u2019s hardly any room.\u201d That, and he was loathe to move from the warmth of Erik\u2019s embrace.</p>\n<p>Erik shifted a little in the dark, and then said, \u201cHere, between my legs--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErik, darling, I told you, we really don\u2019t have room for <i>that</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo sit, Charles,\u201d Erik clarified, sounding very much like he was rolling his eyes. \u201cAnd lean back -- there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d Charles said doubtfully.</p>\n<p>There was a small flash of light as Erik checked his cell phone. \u201cWe have six hours until the first crew comes in,\u201d he said, stealing Charles\u2019 cardigan and shoving it behind his back. \u201cGet some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, all right,\u201d Charles said, and dropped off before his brain could offer any opinions on the wisdom of the past hour.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Erik nudged him awake the next morning, and Charles blearily opened his eyes to the artificial glow of Erik\u2019s cell phone. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s make ourselves presentable,\u201d Erik said, his voice a low rumble.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to look like anything except shagged rotten in a closet,\u201d Charles muttered, but made an effort to drag himself away from the warm of Erik\u2019s chest and tried to put himself together. He was deeply thankful that Erik had taken off his cardigan early in the proceedings, because it was going to hopefully hide the apocalyptic disaster that was his shirt, which they\u2019d evidently used to mop up the night before. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHalf-six,\u201d Erik said, squinting at his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Charles said, taking in a deep breath. \u201cThis is not terrible. I can make this work. No panic attacks, no hyperventilating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were joking about that,\u201d Erik said, concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Charles admitted. \u201cBut I make no promises for Saturday morning.\u201d He ran his hands through his hair, aware it was probably a lost cause. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik tilted the phone in his direction. \u201cLike you were shagged rotten in a closet,\u201d he said, and pulled Charles close for a thorough kiss. \u201cWhen can we do it again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the closet part is optional, I have--\u201d Charles scrolled through the calendar on his phone. \u201cAn hour, starting at 5:30.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the <i>week before the wedding</i>,\u201d Charles said, trying to be patient but failing completely. \u201cIt\u2019s that or nothing today, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll take it. It seems I have a few promises to keep,\u201d Erik said, and the tone in his voice made Charles shiver in anticipation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Charles said, and banged on the sound booth door, calling for the work crew to let them out.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Raven said, juggling her phone and three to-do lists and her handbag. \u201cOne bridesmaid crisis down, probably another three to go. How was your last meeting with the DJ?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSean will be fine,\u201d Charles said, carefully carrying the sample centerpiece into their offices. \u201cWhere are we with the photographers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOfficial or unofficial?\u201d Raven said, eyes a little wild. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing a wedding that actual newspapers want to cover,\u201d she marveled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first of many, let\u2019s hope,\u201d Charles said, trying to be cheerful even though he wanted to sleep for three days straight, preferably in Erik\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>Charles\u2019 phone buzzed then, with a text from Erik: <i>I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re an incubus.</i></p>\n<p>He turned away from Raven to answer, because he knew very well that he had an impossibly self-satisfied smile on his face. <i>Why, Erik, anyone would think you didn\u2019t appreciate my commitment to preparation.</i> He\u2019d managed to track Erik down for an incendiary quickie in the middle of the afternoon the day before, when he\u2019d had one appointment over early and another delayed, and basically yanked Erik into his office, locked the door, and said, \u201cI\u2019m ready, get in me now,\u201d and watched Erik\u2019s eyes go dark and crazy with lust.</p>\n<p>\n<i>I\u2019m full of admiration for your attention to detail, Mr. Xavier. I suppose I won\u2019t be seeing you again until the wedding?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Charles smiled regretfully at that. <i>What I wouldn\u2019t give for a spare hour or six today, Mr. Lehnsherr. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.</i></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, seriously, if you are sexting that architect right now I am going to kill you,\u201d Raven said, but since she didn\u2019t actually sound angry about it, Charles just stuck his phone in his pocket and went to help her with the newest snag in the hotel reservations.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The reception was almost over, and Charles felt, well, triumphant and <i>destroyed</i> and so tired that he was actually edging toward giddiness. Probably drinking straight out of a champagne bottle was not going to improve matters, but Charles figured he deserved it.</p>\n<p>The wedding party was gone, as were the majority of the guests. At this point, Charles just wanted to kick all the stragglers out, manners and reputation be damned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d Erik asked, looking as devastatingly delicious in his tuxedo as he had all night.</p>\n<p>\u201cPart of the job,\u201d Charles said. \u201cI have to stay until the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles took another swig of champagne. \u201cGone to, er, assist the caterer with something I don\u2019t want to know anything about, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Erik said. And then he held out a hand. \u201cDance with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles looked at him dubiously. \u201cIt\u2019s charming that you think I can even stand at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had wondered,\u201d Erik said, all smug innuendo, and Charles snorted in response and accepted the hand up.</p>\n<p>He let Erik lead, mostly because Erik was taller and of the two of them, could actually be trusted not to navigate them into a table, which was more than Charles could say of himself at this point. Also, there was something very nice about being able to just to lean into Erik and just <i>be</i>, for awhile.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome home with me,\u201d Erik murmured in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really might fall over dead,\u201d Charles warned him.</p>\n<p>Erik laughed a little at that, and then pressed a terribly tender kiss to Charles\u2019 neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come home with me, this will make the first of Shaw\u2019s weddings where I didn\u2019t get laid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain I saw at least three unattached bridesmaids,\u201d Charles said, fighting down a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me a disheveled wedding planner will do, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Schatz</i>, I\u2019m not settling,\u201d Erik said, and kissed him, slow and deliberate and wonderful.</p>\n<p>Charles looked him in the eye, feeling a little shaky but also deeply, irrationally <i>sure</i>, remembering Emma saying, <i> I didn\u2019t used to think that really happened, that you could just meet someone--</i></p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me politely kick everyone out, and then take me home,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d Erik said, a sharp smile filling his face.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cCharles, leave it,\u201d Erik said sternly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d Erik said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the <i>opening of your own firm</i>,\u201d Charles said sarcastically. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you want me to just sit back and have Raven do everything. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but it is actually my job to do these things, and furthermore, I\u2019m really quite good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich I am not arguing, but you promised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Charles said, sulking and fiddling with his cufflinks. \u201cI\u2019ll be uselessly decorative on your arm, as promised, and not deal with any one of the twenty things that are bound to blow up in Raven\u2019s face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich she can handle, and I wouldn\u2019t call your decoration useless,\u201d Erik said, and kissed him. \u201cCall it an anniversary present to me, if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles blinked at him. \u201cA few days late, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Erik sighed, sounding less exasperated and more fond. \u201cI\u2019m counting from the wedding, which was the first time you actually let me be a gentleman and feed you and put you to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charles felt his face flush. \u201cOh. Well. Anniversary present it is. Just let me--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Charles</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, all right. Let\u2019s go win you some new clients, shall we? By which I mean, of course, that I\u2019m going to be charming in their direction and you\u2019ll be terrifying, and they\u2019ll fall all over themselves to give you their business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that really how it works?\u201d Erik said, brow furrowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, darling,\u201d Charles said, beaming. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? It\u2019s like I can read people\u2019s minds.\u201d</p>"
