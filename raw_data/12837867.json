  "text": "<p>Hugging his brother for a hasty few minutes is not enough to siphon away the anxiety prickling through him. Thor finds himself turning from his conversations the rest of the evening to catch Loki out of the corner of his eye, to see he is there \u2014 charming people and drinking and keeping a wide berth away from Hulk \u2014 and not burning in the ashes of Asgard, or on his merry way somewhere without Thor. Loki sees him looking more than once; twice he lifts his eyebrow at Thor; three times after that he rolls his eyes and stalks over to Thor, holding a glass in one hand and reaching out to pinch Thor\u2019s upper arm viciously with the other. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, look, I'm still here,\u201d Loki says, widening his eyes over-large.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn't I be the one pinching you?\u201d Thor asks. Loki favors him with an incredulous look down the length of his nose, before walking off again to the little cluster of people he's been absently healing of minor wounds. </p>\n<p>They've figured out the quarters situation, at least. Loki has a separate room, but when it's time to retire, Thor doesn't even pretend to consider it: on thumping feet he follows Loki, who seems to be pretending he's gone suddenly deaf, until they get to Loki\u2019s door. Then Loki turns to look at him, and gives a world-weary sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, alright,\u201d Loki says, throwing the door open and ushering Thor in. \u201cIf you steal the blankets, I'll stab you while you're sleeping.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise not to snore and I'll consider it,\u201d Thor says happily, and makes himself comfortable on one side of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do <em>not</em> \u2014 \u201d Loki begins, in tones of great affront, before cutting himself off as he gets into the other side. \u201cShut up, I'm not doing this with you. I'm <em>exhausted</em>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You're</em> exhausted,\u201d Thor says as Loki turns off the light. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Loki retorts. He rustles around in the darkness, tucking himself into the blankets. \u201cI did a lot of running to save the day today, if you remember.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI lost an eye,\u201d Thor says complacently.</p>\n<p>There's a pause. \u201cI <em>hate</em> you,\u201d Loki says with feeling. \u201cThis is how it's going to go from now on, isn't it? We're arguing, and then \u2014 bam! \u2018I lost an eye, I win\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor grins faintly. \u201cAre you going to be around to be bothered by it?\u201d he says; if there's an all-too-naked search for reassurance in his voice, well. He doesn't mind being obvious if it'll get him what he wants. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon't tempt me,\u201d Loki says darkly. But he turns toward Thor to sleep, and lets Thor\u2019s outflung hand brush his side, and even, stealthily, moves ever-so-slightly closer. </p>\n<p>Thor falls asleep like that. He wakes once in the night, but Loki\u2019s soft snoring fills his ears before he registers anything else. They've moved closer together while sleeping, and Thor\u2019s hand is clutching the front of Loki\u2019s shirt. He relaxes back into a pure, undisturbed sleep. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morning is a different story. </p>\n<p>Thor comes awake with a jolt as he hits the floor, a pain flaring in his hip. He tries to move his arms and blinks in confusion when he can't, before he realizes all his limbs are trapped in a cocoon of blankets. </p>\n<p>Over the edge of the bed, Loki scowls down at him. His hair is a tangled curling mess; there's a pillow-crease cutting across his cheek. </p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>warned</em> you,\u201d Loki hisses.</p>\n<p>Thor just wraps himself up tighter; Loki clearly didn't think this through. \u201cThese are mine now,\u201d he informs Loki. </p>\n<p>The blankets wind around and around him, trapping his limbs further and nearly stuffing themselves in his mouth, before he manages to get his head free. Then Loki throws both pillows at his head for good measure.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun with them,\u201d Loki says, smirking down at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fine,\u201d Thor says, glaring. The blankets\u2019 grip eases slightly. \u201c<em>I</em> have work to do, anyway.\u201d </p>\n<p>Loki yawns delicately, and then reaches down to draw the blankets back up toward him, hand-over-hand like a fisherman lifting a net. The pillows float up after them. \u201cHow sad for you,\u201d he says, tucking himself back into a roll atop the bed. </p>\n<p>Thor leaves him alone, after swatting his upturned rump and dodging the green bolt Loki aims at him in response. Loki will join him soon enough; if nothing else, his inclination toward lounging around and critiquing Thor\u2019s every move will prove too great a draw to remain in bed much longer. </p>\n<p>Thor shuts the door to Loki\u2019s room behind him, and then looks up and down the hallway, trying to remember the best way to the center of the ship. He sees three of his people passing by and smiles at them in greeting; he gets three very odd looks in response, before they seem to remember themselves and smile hesitantly back as they continue walking. Perhaps Thor\u2019s been away from home for too long, if his people seem this hesitant to talk to him.</p>\n<p>Oh well. It's nothing a long journey in a creepy dictator\u2019s stolen ship can't fix. </p>\n<p>Thor shrugs it off and follows them down the hall. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By midday, or as best as he can gauge it in space, Thor has met with Heimdall, looked over the star charts to review their course, visited the wounded, and received no less than twelve versions of the odd looks he'd gotten this morning. </p>\n<p>They aren't interested or admiring in nature \u2014 not to get too big a head, but Thor knows what <em>that</em> looks like. The missing eye hasn't hurt him there. No, these seem inquisitive, accompanied with furtive whispering and wide eyes. </p>\n<p>(Thor checks three times to make sure there isn't something stuck in his teeth, just to be safe.)</p>\n<p>For now, he puts the mystery out of his head. Perhaps later he'll track down Loki and make him put his sly little talents to good use. </p>\n<p>Thor sets up a table in the mess with ease \u2014 it feels good to do something tangible \u2014 and then turns and promptly walks hip-first into another one, jabbing straight into the bruise from his rude awakening this morning. He winces and rubs his hip. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, sire?\u201d Gytha asks, fixing him with her clear brown eyes. She has a clearer sense of duty: Thor had offered up his services and found that she had no problem telling her new king when he was putting something in the wrong place. Thor had promptly put her in charge of the rest of the setup in that wing. </p>\n<p>\u201cI'm fine,\u201d Thor says. \u201cLoki just kicked me out of bed this morning.\u201d He presses again against the bruise on his hip and starts forming vague plans for revenge. </p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gytha says, a strangled note in her voice. She coughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou're not falling ill, are you?\u201d Thor says, concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Gytha says. \u201cJust a cough, sire. Carry on.\u201d She retreats and leaves Thor to his work. He\u2019s on his sixth table when he feels his feet start to slip out from underneath him, and hastily puts the table down before he can drop it. </p>\n<p>\u201cLoki,\u201d Thor says under his breath, and turns to see Loki perched atop the table behind him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an excellent use of your time,\u201d Loki says brightly, looking around. </p>\n<p>\u201cI'm doing other things too,\u201d Thor protests, and then does his best to bury the petulant edge to his voice only Loki can bring out in him. \u201cI thought we should get this sorted quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFood <em>would</em> be the first thing on your mind,\u201d Loki says, amused. He pulls an apple out of his pocket and splits it neatly in half with a fingertip, offering one piece to Thor. \u201cHere. We can't have our king fainting from hunger, can we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor gives him a very suspicious look. Loki bears it with all appearance of endless patience. Finally Thor takes the apple half and eats it in four bites, tucking the core into his pocket. </p>\n<p>Loki eats his half while Thor finishes working, sucking all of his fingers clean when he's done. Then he waves a hand at Thor imperiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me down,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Thor rolls his eye, but clasps Loki\u2019s hand to pull him down from the table. Loki trips down and falls into Thor, pressing them together from shoulders to hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoops,\u201d Loki laughs in Thor\u2019s ear quietly, and pulls away. Clasping Thor\u2019s shoulder, he says, \u201cI'll leave you to it,\u201d and leaves. </p>\n<p>Thor squints after him for a moment, before shaking his brother's odd behavior out of his head. If the years have taught him anything, it's that nothing Loki does can be explained until he wants it to be. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>During dinner that evening, Thor sits at the end of one bench next to Loki. For some reason Loki is pressed so close to him their thighs touch; perhaps Loki doesn't want to move any closer to Valkyrie, lounging on his other side with a flat, amused look on her face. </p>\n<p>Thor spends the meal making bemused conversation with Korg, and trying to seem approachable to the two Asgardians sitting next to him. It doesn't seem to be working from the wide-eyed half-glances they keep sending him. Valkyrie eats her meal in silence, repelling conversation with the narrow-eyed, watchful cloak around her. </p>\n<p>Loki finishes his last bite. \u201cWell, I think it's time to retire,\u201d he says, rising from the bench. Getting up requires a clinging arm around Thor\u2019s shoulders, apparently. Then he bends his head and presses a long, lingering kiss to the curve of Thor\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he says, smiling very sweetly, and leaves. </p>\n<p>Everything in Thor\u2019s head grinds to a halt. When he looks around the table, no one looks confused or shocked \u2014 just amused, or interested, or a little wide-eyed. </p>\n<p>Thor isn't confused either, or shocked, when he thinks about it for a second more. He knows <em>exactly</em> what's going on.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he growls, and gets up so fast he almost turns the table on its head. </p>\n<p>The door to Loki\u2019s room swings open when Thor puts a hand to it. Loki is sitting on the bed, pulling the ribbon loose from his hair, a wicked laugh tucked into the corners of his mouth. </p>\n<p>Thor pulls the door shut behind him. \u201cWhat are you <em>doing</em>,\u201d he says, crossing his arms in front of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's your fault, you know,\u201d Loki says, smirking and leaning back on his hands. \u201cLeaving my room in the morning; your inability to think about what comes out of your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor\u2019s ears are burning. He determinedly ignores them. \u201cAnd you're encouraging this because \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's excellent rehabilitation for my image,\u201d Loki says, widening his eyes. \u201cThey love you, and because of that they'll trust me. You wouldn't ruin this for me, would you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Thor glares at him. </p>\n<p>Loki\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cAlso, it's the funniest thing that's ever happened to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor slams the door behind him and storms away, nearly knocking over four children playing in the hallway.</p>\n<p><em>Loki</em>. Loki and his endless, irritating little <em>games</em>.</p>\n<p>Thor falls asleep alone in his room that night, shivering from the cold; he wakes three times, sweating and searching for something he can't see the shape of, hands empty and grasping in the sheets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day finds Thor more problems than the previous. Instead of questioning looks, this time Thor is surrounded by concerned ones. When she sees him, Ingrid, who used to work in the palace kitchens once upon a time and now rules their makeshift one with an iron fist, pats his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t sleep apart,\u201d she says sagely, putting a steaming roll of bread in front of Thor; apparently he looks pathetic enough to warrant it. \u201cNo problems were ever solved that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re <em>not</em> \u2014 \u201d Thor begins, before sighing and giving up, shoving the roll in his mouth. He\u2019s already tried denying their relationship three times today; all he\u2019s gotten in response are disappointed looks and earnest reassurances: \u201cSire, we may not have trusted Prince Loki before, but you needn\u2019t deny your heart for our sake!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thor says finally, through a mouthful of bread. There are some battles he can\u2019t win.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Valkyrie says, standing next to Thor and looking out into space with him at the front of the ship. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Thor says pathetically. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Valkyrie says. \u201cYour brother\u2019s always starting things, I get it. But I\u2019ve got to tell you \u2014 it\u2019s kind of your fault too that people believe him. You guys are weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not \u2014 I\u2019m not weird!\u201d Thor says, indignant.</p>\n<p>Valkyrie gives him a pitying look. \u201cYou two really have to stop insisting he\u2019s adopted if you don\u2019t want people to think you\u2019re fucking,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>Thor gapes at her wordlessly as she picks her nails clean with a little knife, and then wanders off with a bracing clap on his back. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so hard,\u201d Loki sighs, a thick, despondent note in his voice. Thor freezes at the entrance to the room where they\u2019ve kept their wounded, and hangs back half-hidden behind one side of the doorway. He watches Loki smoothe a salve down a woman\u2019s arms with careful hands, head bowed slightly, looking up at her through his hair. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much; I\u2019ve tried to prove myself, but \u2014 perhaps it\u2019s a lost cause. Perhaps I should just stop trying.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s immediately surrounded by horrified gasps. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d a young man with earnest blue eyes says, leaning in to Loki. \u201cI\u2019m sure His Majesty will come around \u2014 you can\u2019t give up!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Loki says. He sounds sad and weary enough to fall to pieces right in front of them.</p>\n<p>Over their heads, Loki finds Thor. There is a bare flash of a smirk in his eyes, in the curve of his lips. </p>\n<p>Loki\u2019s voice rings in Thor\u2019s ears, invasive and relentless, as he stomps back down the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thor thinks about asking Heimdall for his help, for a minute. </p>\n<p>\u201cI see everything that happens,\u201d he imagines Heimdall announcing, \u201cand your king is most definitely <em>not</em> sleeping with his brother. I swear it!\u201d</p>\n<p>He finds Heimdall watching their warriors sparring, and gets so far as to open his mouth to speak.</p>\n<p>Heimdall turns to face him with a look of such patient, knowing amusement it could have been lifted straight from Frigga\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>Cheeks burning, Thor swallows his words and leaves. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, in his room, Thor hears an insistent knock at the door. When he opens it, he sees Loki standing there with his arms crossed and a faint scowl bunched between his brows. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have them think you\u2019re the magnanimous one who always reaches out,\u201d Loki says sharply, putting one foot in the door. \u201cWe\u2019re sleeping in your room tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Thor looks at him closely, there\u2019s a sallow tinge to his skin, a faint hint of bruising beneath his eyes that suggests his sleep might have been as disturbed the night before as Thor\u2019s had been. The wild look on his face practically dares Thor to say something about it. </p>\n<p>Thor pushes the door further open. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to do something about the snoring,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional,\u201d Loki replies, as Thor shuts the door behind him. \u201cI <em>don\u2019t</em> snore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thor is hyper-conscious of the heat of Loki\u2019s body as they lie down together in his bed. Even with the inches separating them, he is fever-hot; he lies with his back to Thor, a rigid line screaming of tension. </p>\n<p>Thor knows what he searches for in the night when he wakes. Here, in the darkness, he is brave enough to hold it. </p>\n<p>Loki stiffens under the arm Thor slings over his waist. After a sharp, expectant moment, he relaxes down, and scoots back one careful step at a time. Thor\u2019s knees fit perfectly into the bends of Loki\u2019s, his chest a scant distance away from the span of Loki\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>They won\u2019t talk about this; and they don't need to. It\u2019s enough that they can sleep, through the night, and free of dreams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thor wakes the next morning with new resolve. There are ways and <em>ways</em> to combat Loki\u2019s mischief; if he can\u2019t stop him where he stands, he will simply have to play his game, and beat him at it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my best to move past everything,\u201d Thor says morosely, chin propped up in his hand. \u201cI just \u2014 I <em>want</em> to believe he\u2019s here for good, but I\u2019ve done it so many times before. I guess I\u2019m worried about being burned again.\u201d He summons a determinedly stoic look, underpinned by quivering pain; it\u2019s a combination that always served him well as a child, wheedling sweets from the kitchens after being punished for some bout of trouble. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Ingrid says tearfully, patting his head softly. \u201cTrust is such a hard thing to rebuild.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Thor says, sniffling faintly.</p>\n<p>Loki finds him at lunchtime; when he enters the room, he is followed by narrowed eyes and judgmental looks, though his upturned chin says he notices none of them. </p>\n<p>Thor knows differently:</p>\n<p>\u201cWell done,\u201d Loki says quietly, venomously, as he sits next to Thor. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d Thor replies. He keeps the smirk off his face, containing it to the crinkle of his eye as he turns his face toward Loki. Then he raises his voice: \u201cWon\u2019t you join me?\u201d he says, injecting a faint tremor into his voice. </p>\n<p>The thin press of Loki\u2019s lips promises murder, but if Thor looks closely, he can see a spark of humor deep in his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d <em>love</em> to,\u201d Loki says solicitously. He spends his meal spooning choice bites onto Thor\u2019s plate and, beneath the table, stepping on Thor\u2019s feet with a vicious heel. </p>\n<p>Thor puts up with it through most of his lunch \u2014 the flush of victory is heady indeed \u2014 but near the end he drops his hand onto Loki\u2019s thigh and sends a sharp, warning shock of lightning through him. </p>\n<p>Loki jolts in place, and then catches himself. The look on his face could melt iron. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight,\u201d Thor says brightly, and bends his head to kiss the corner of Loki\u2019s mouth as he stands up.</p>\n<p>Loki\u2019s skin is marble-pale, but warm as the sun beneath Thor\u2019s lips. As Thor retreats, he turns to see Loki staying in place, stiff-backed and set-faced, one hand touching his mouth. </p>\n<p>Loki can start what he wants; Thor has <em>no</em> problem escalating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Valkyrie asks. Her voice is filled with mocking amusement, but oddly fond, for all that. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thor says, one hand over his face. \u201cGive me another drink.\u201d </p>\n<p>The world quakes beneath Thor; when he takes his hand away from his face, he finds Hulk sitting next to him cross-legged, smiling beatifically at Valkyrie. </p>\n<p>\u201cTHOR LIKE PUNY GOD?\u201d Hulk booms inquisitively. </p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I <em>like</em> him, sure,\u201d Thor says awkwardly. It feels a little wrong to lie to Hulk about this; Hulk and Banner, hiding inside him, are his teammates after all. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two women pass by them on the other side of the room, apparently not noticing the three of them lurking in the corner, surrounded by Valkyrie\u2019s impressive stash of alcohol. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan you believe he\u2019s loved King Thor for <em>centuries</em>?\u201d one of them sighs, clasping one hand to the side of her face. \u201cIsn\u2019t that so romantic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>sad</em>,\u201d the other one says. \u201cHis feelings going unnoticed, unrequited for so long\u2026\u201d Their voices trail off as they continue down their path, leaving the three of them alone.</p>\n<p>Hulk claps Thor\u2019s back so hard he falls forward. \u201cTHOR MARRY PUNY GOD,\u201d he says decisively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014 need to go,\u201d Thor says, and knocks back his drink, hoping it will help. He pretends he can\u2019t hear Valkyrie\u2019s stifled laughter as he leaves. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thor buckles down and does the kind of organizational work he\u2019s always run from, but is so much of what he needs to do now: he goes over their meagre budget, reviews the building plans for their new settlement when they land on Earth, and smooths out a conflict over working space between their healers and their engineers. Then he rewards himself with a visit to the sparring ring. </p>\n<p>It proves nowhere near as relaxing as he had hoped.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy wife and I have had our ups and downs,\u201d says Brandt, who looks barely old enough to have a beard, let alone a wife. \u201cHer family\u2019s never thought much of me, and for a while she didn\u2019t say much to them to support me, and then one time I thought she might be seeing my brother behind my back but it turns out she was planning a surprise for my birthday instead!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLoki faked his own <em>death</em>, and never bothered to tell me he was alive until I found out for myself,\u201d Thor says, and then presses his lips together, surprised at the very real bite in his own words.</p>\n<p>Brandt gives him a sympathetic look. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard one to get past, sire,\u201d he says. When Thor looks around the ring, he sees he is receiving sympathetic looks tenfold, from all corners. He hides a sigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s try three of you at once,\u201d he says, and readies his sword. It won\u2019t be anywhere near a challenge, but it might just be enough to clear his mind for a precious few moments. </p>\n<p>An hour later, Thor leaves the ring, sword sheathed at his side and wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. He stops in his tracks when he sees Loki, leaning against the wall with one foot propped up against it. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anything; neither does Loki. There\u2019s an odd, crackling fire in Loki\u2019s eyes, visible even with the distance separating them. Then Loki takes a step forward, and another, and another yet. He stops in front of Thor and lifts a hand to Thor\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>Thor\u2019s breath catches in his throat. Loki carefully stops a bead of sweat from coursing down Thor\u2019s cheek with his fingertip, swipes another away from his hairline. Then he wipes his fingertips neatly on the front of Thor\u2019s shirt, adjusts the fall of his collar; turns on his heel, and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thor wakes in the middle of the night with a cry caught in his throat. He scrambles to put a hand over Loki\u2019s face; it isn\u2019t until he can feel the faint puffs of breath leaving Loki\u2019s nose that he is able to breathe himself, closing his eyes and willing his heart to slow down.</p>\n<p>Loki comes awake under Thor\u2019s hand. He can feel the ripple of awareness roll through his brother from head to toe. Loki turns on his side to face Thor; the room is so dark that Thor can only see faint outlines of Loki\u2019s features, and he can\u2019t imagine Loki can see much more, but it must be enough: Loki says nothing, but reaches down to grab Thor\u2019s hand. Loki spreads open the fingers of it, and places it square over his heart. Thor feels the strong pumping of it beneath his hand and wishes suddenly he could reach into Loki\u2019s chest and curl his fingers around the organ itself, to know the truth of its vitality. He removes his hand and puts it under Loki\u2019s shirt this time, pushing up. The thump of Loki\u2019s heart coupled with the living warmth of his skin is a comfort that sinks into Thor\u2019s bones; he falls asleep like that between the beats he can\u2019t help but count. </p>\n<p>When Thor wakes the next morning, Loki is still asleep, chest rising and falling beneath Thor\u2019s hand. His skin is smooth and faintly slick with sleep-sweat in the burrow of their blankets. </p>\n<p>Thor bites his lip hard enough to jolt himself fully awake. Then he carefully withdraws his hand and gets up from the bed, finds his boots and makes his way to the door.</p>\n<p>He stops with one hand on the door. Inside their quarters they\u2019ve formed a sanctuary of sorts: a wordless space, where everything is ignored except the things that matter most at that moment. Outside, it\u2019s a different story altogether.</p>\n<p>Thor lingers in it for a moment more, before he lets himself out of the room on silent feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things are quiet for the first half of the day; but by lunch Thor notices a resurgence of the half-hidden whispers that have surrounded him these past few days, accompanied by glances that rapidly dart away. No one tells him what new ground Loki has struck in this contest of theirs, and Thor is not yet so pathetic that he will go and ask. </p>\n<p>Before he gets to that point, Korg finds him working in his chair-throne at the front of the ship, and pulls up another chair from somewhere to sit next to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d Korg says, bumping his shoulder against Thor\u2019s and sending his pen skidding across the paper. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, good,\u201d Thor says, shaking his arm out and trying to see how much he can salvage on the page. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d Korg says, nodding his head. \u201cI just wanted to say, I had the same problem with my girl back in the day, before I learned better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...What problem,\u201d Thor says. </p>\n<p>Korg bends his head conspiratorially. \u201cI mean, when you\u2019re a big guy and you\u2019re young you think you\u2019re supposed to be in charge or whatever, but she taught me to be a giver. You need to be a <em>giver</em>, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Thor says.</p>\n<p>The set of Korg\u2019s face is sympathetic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like your brother is too, uh, satisfied. If you get my drift.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>,\u201d Thor says; and then he shakes his head sharply, and holds up his hand to stop Korg from saying anything more. Through the white-hot outrage rising in him, he spares a brief moment to be very thankful he isn\u2019t having <em>this</em> conversation with Ingrid, at least, before he gets up so fast his papers fall off his lap. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m \u2014 leaving. Bye, Korg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCommunication is the key to a good relationship!\u201d Korg calls after Thor as he stalks off to find his brother and kill him very, very slowly. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As luck would have it, Loki is in his room when Thor finds him. This way no one will be around when Thor kills him and throws his body into space.</p>\n<p>Loki takes one look at his face and starts laughing so hard it devolves into coughing midway through. He claps a hand over his mouth to contain it, shoulders shaking. </p>\n<p>Thor throws a spark of lightning at Loki; the little shudder that rolls through him barely takes the edge off the burning indignation rising in Thor\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis <em>would</em> be the thing that gets you,\u201d Loki says, voice still wavering with laughter. \u201cOh, I\u2019m a genius.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying little <em>snake</em>,\u201d Thor says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you loved snakes,\u201d Loki says, batting his eyelashes. Thor throws his boots at Loki\u2019s head. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow everyone thinks I'm a bad lay!\u201d Thor says. </p>\n<p>Loki affects a tremulous, brave little smile. \u201cOh, I suppose I'm just not yet used to your brutish ways \u2014 your lack of reciprocity \u2014 perhaps in <em>time</em> \u2014 \u201d He starts laughing again when Thor tackles him back on the bed and sits on top of him, trying to smother him with a pillow. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou go back out there and tell them I'm the best you've ever <em>had</em>,\u201d Thor says, tightening his thighs around Loki to stop his wriggling. </p>\n<p>\u201cListen, I know I'm a liar, but I don't think even <em>I</em> can pull that off,\u201d Loki says.</p>\n<p>Thor lifts the pillow again \u2014 and then pauses. </p>\n<p>There's a goading glint in Loki\u2019s eyes, a challenge in the expectant sprawl of his body; the minute Thor sees it, he recognizes it for what it is. </p>\n<p><em>There's no way you can get across that river, Thor</em>; and <em>Like you can sneak into Father and Mother\u2019s room without them noticing</em>; and <em>I bet you're too scared of our tutors to skip lessons today</em>. Dare after dare after dare: the things Loki doesn't want to do first, or alone. </p>\n<p>Thor sees it, and lets the pillow fall from his hands. </p>\n<p>Ah, well. Such are the trials of being the elder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess I'll have to prove it to you,\u201d Thor says, and bends to kiss Loki\u2019s smirking mouth. </p>\n<p>There is no hesitation in Loki\u2019s response: his mouth softens under Thor\u2019s as he fists his hands in the front of Thor\u2019s shirt and <em>yanks</em> him down until he's fully sprawled on top of Loki. </p>\n<p>Loki\u2019s mouth is wet and greedy. He traps Thor\u2019s tongue and won't release it for a long, suckling moment that tightens a fist of need in Thor\u2019s belly. The strange sparking newness of this could throw him off, if not for the blood still pumping hot in his veins that won't let him think too hard, if not for the fact that he has a <em>challenge</em> to take up. </p>\n<p>Loki tries and tries to bring fury to their kiss; instead, Thor catches his head in both hands and gentles it, teasing Loki\u2019s mouth further open with the tip of his tongue, sucking the curve of his lower lip until it's plum-tender and swollen. Loki squirms beneath him, trying to get more \u2014 but then he gives, slapping Thor\u2019s hip in one last lashing-out before he goes boneless, letting Thor have his mouth. </p>\n<p>When Thor finally releases Loki, he's flushed and swollen-mouthed and wild-eyed, panting for breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Loki says. His voice is syrupy-thick with swallowed heat. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Thor says, wiping his mouth dry and letting a little \u2014 only a very little \u2014 smugness come through. He doesn't want to drive Loki to stab him, after all; just throw him a little off balance. Then he tugs the collar of Loki\u2019s shirt away from his long, pale neck, teasing the hollow of his throat with his fingertips. \u201cGet rid of our clothes,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Loki looks for an instant as if he might refuse just to be contrary; but then his hands make a sharp gesture between them and they are both bare. The long, skin-warm press of their bodies is a heady thing. Thor catches Loki\u2019s wrists in one hand and holds them tight as he kisses his way down the length of Loki\u2019s throat, nipping softly to feel Loki shudder beneath his mouth. He investigates the slope of muscle down Loki\u2019s shoulders, the hard wings of his collarbones, the tight pebbled buds of his nipples: nothing of his brother's he hasn't seen before, but fascinating and dizzyingly new like this. A pink flush rises up and washes down Loki\u2019s marble-pale skin; Thor teases it brighter and brighter across his heaving chest, biting the planes and dips of him until Loki growls and winds his legs around Thor\u2019s hips, rubbing the hard dripping curve of his cock against Thor\u2019s belly. </p>\n<p>Thor keeps Loki\u2019s wrists in one hand. With the other he grips their cocks together and strokes them once, shuddering at the hot friction of it.</p>\n<p>Loki wrenches his wrists against the grip of Thor\u2019s hand, but doesn't break free. \u201cDo <em>not</em> make me ask,\u201d he snarls. </p>\n<p>\u201cHave I done that yet?\u201d Thor asks, lifting an eyebrow. He releases Loki and then flips him onto his belly. Loki glares at him over his shoulder, but fists his hands in the sheets and arches his back up when Thor kisses down the length of his spine. </p>\n<p>\u201cOil,\u201d Thor says, tapping Loki\u2019s hip. </p>\n<p>\u201cI see I have to do everything around here,\u201d Loki grumbles, but he snaps his fingers, and oil pools slowly in the curve of Thor\u2019s palm. </p>\n<p>Thor opens Loki up as slowly as he himself can stand; it's too slow by far for Loki, who bucks back to impale himself further on Thor\u2019s fingers, cursing Thor\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'd hate to be accused of having brutish ways,\u201d Thor says reasonably, and twists his fingers just as Loki looks like he might be summoning up the composure to kick Thor somewhere tender. </p>\n<p>Eventually it's too much for even Thor: he slicks up his cock with the remaining oil and fucks Loki open, hand slipping off Loki\u2019s hip until he wipes it clean of oil on the sheets. </p>\n<p>Loki is stubbornly quiet, though Thor can read volumes in the minute shifting of his limbs and his clenching hands. Thor fucks him in slow patient thrusts, tipping his hips into different angles until finally Loki exhales sharply, slapping the bed with one hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Thor says aloud, and proceeds to fuck Loki as thoroughly and tenderly as he knows how; the curve of Loki\u2019s back fit to Thor\u2019s chest is a familiar thing now, but the way he responds to Thor\u2019s mouth on the back of his neck is not. </p>\n<p>The hold Loki has on his tongue finally breaks. \u201cDamn it, fuck me <em>harder</em>,\u201d he snaps, clenching around Thor\u2019s cock as if he can take it himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn't enough for you?\u201d Thor says in his ear, solicitously. He reaches under Loki and palms the stiff length of Loki\u2019s cock. Loki\u2019s hand flies up to grab the back of Thor\u2019s forearm, nails digging in. He doesn't let go, even as Thor strokes him to completion \u2014 he just digs his nails in harder, and squeezes around Thor so tight Thor has to bite the inside of his cheek hard, the bright copper flash of blood clearing his head enough that he doesn't just follow Loki right over the edge. </p>\n<p>He watches Loki pant for breath, head bowed and hair falling around him; he watches him realize that Thor is still inside him, still hard. </p>\n<p>Loki turns his head to look at Thor over his shoulder, eyes burning bright. \u201cYou and your bruised ego,\u201d he says. \u201cYou're so <em>predictable</em>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Thor pulls out halfway and thrusts back in, startling a little moan from Loki\u2019s throat. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it too much?\u201d Thor says, thumbing the ring of Loki\u2019s hole stretched around his cock.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I can't take whatever you give out,\u201d Loki scoffs. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>good</em>,\u201d Thor says. </p>\n<p>When he fucks Loki this time, he is just as slow, just as gentle; but Loki, oversensitive from coming, can't stop shivering and shivering beneath him. Twice Thor even draws from him something that sounds like a sob. </p>\n<p>Thor puts a hand on Loki\u2019s come-slick belly, running his hand up and down it as Loki\u2019s cock slowly rises hard again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need \u2014 \u201d Loki starts, voice failing him halfway through. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know what you need,\u201d Thor says. He rolls his hips forward, pulling Loki back toward him at the same time. Loki cries out and puts a hand on his cock; releases it immediately like it's too much, but then starts stroking himself again like he can't even help himself. Thor fucks Loki into coming a second time \u2014 squirming and moaning throughout, trembling like he doesn't know if he wants to get away or wants even more. </p>\n<p>Finally, Thor lets himself go: he finishes buried deep inside Loki, coming so hard there's a dull roaring in his ears, popped like he's been through a pressure change. His face feels winter-numb. </p>\n<p>When he pulls out, Loki almost falls forward, before Thor catches him. Then he finds himself distracted by the spread of Loki's cheeks, his swollen hole slowly leaking drips of Thor\u2019s come. </p>\n<p>Thor bites his lip, hard. Then he turns Loki carefully onto his back and lies down next to him. If he has to look at Loki\u2019s thoroughly fucked ass any longer he might actually lose his mind. </p>\n<p>Loki has his eyes closed like he's sleeping; Thor looks at him, wet-mouthed and come-slick and still panting for breath, and then touches two fingertips to Loki\u2019s soft parted mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should tell everyone you cried, it was so good,\u201d Thor says, smirking. </p>\n<p>Loki opens one eye and looks at him sidelong. \u201cI think you can go around tomorrow as palpably smug as you plan to be, and count yourself lucky that I'll <em>let</em> you,\u201d he says waspishly. </p>\n<p>Thor leans over to nip the base of Loki\u2019s throat, the soft skin under Loki\u2019s jaw when he throws his head back to make room for Thor. Then he says in Loki\u2019s ear, \u201cI'll accept your counteroffer,\u201d and draws him closer into his arms. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day, Thor enters the sparring ring and sees everyone immediately jump to their feet. For a brief confusing moment there's a cacophony of noise around him, before it resolves into roughly thirty of his people trying to shake his hand or clap him on the back at once. </p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, sire!\u201d he hears in ten different voices, and lets his hand be pumped up and down by an earnest, beaming Brandt.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarriage is a wonderful thing, sire!\u201d Brandt says. \u201cYou'll see \u2014 why, my wife and I...\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of his words trail off to Thor\u2019s ears as he stops listening. Across the room, he sees a flash of green that solidifies into his brother, leaning against the wall and smirking. </p>\n<p>Loki meets Thor\u2019s gaze; winks, and slowly disappears.</p>"
