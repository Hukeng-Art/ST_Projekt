  "text": "<p>\u201cOver here, Lena!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking the water from her umbrella, Lena spots Sam at a table in the corner of the caf\u00e9, far from the rain-streaked windows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I came at all, in this weather,\u201d Lena grumbles as she sits down, leaning the umbrella against her chair and trying her best not to get water all over her pantyhose. Sam smiles, pushing a large cappuccino towards her \u2013 Lena takes an appreciative sip, humming at the warmth and the jolt of caffeine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but this proves that you truly love me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas there ever any doubt?\u201d Lena says, and Sam laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cConsidering I\u2019ve hardly seen you in three weeks, I\u2019d say so!\u201d</p>\n<p>Guilt stabs at Lena\u2019s chest at the comment. She has been working crazy hours lately \u2013 L-Corp is in the process of acquiring a new company, and she\u2019s been working overtime to make sure it goes smoothly. Sam is one of the few people she sees outside of work, and she hasn\u2019t been making enough time for her.</p>\n<p>Sam\u2019s phone pings next to her on the table, the screen lighting up with a new message, and Sam glances down at it. Whatever it says, it makes her face light up in a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, how is Alex?\u201d Lena asks, looking pointedly at Sam\u2019s phone. Sam grins guiltily, but her happiness is infectious.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat! She and Ruby love each other, so that\u2019s one less thing to worry about. Honestly, she\u2019s pretty wonderful.\u201d Sam\u2019s smile turns dreamy, and Lena can\u2019t help but feel a bit jealous. She knows she shouldn\u2019t \u2013 Sam is happy, and that\u2019s the most important thing \u2013 but whatever Sam is feeling seems to be the complete opposite of every relationship Lena has ever had.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a little upset that I still haven\u2019t met her,\u201d she says instead, sipping her coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Sam agrees. \u201cBut even <em>I</em> barely get to see you right now. I had to practically drag you out of the office today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lena says, squeezing Sam\u2019s hand briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s been a mess at L-Corp. I promise I\u2019ll make more time. What with this acquisition, and the whole James fiasco\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam winces sympathetically. \u201cIs he still acting weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena sighs, dipping a finger into her cappuccino foam and licking it off. She\u2019s been on edge all week, waiting for James to come get the rest of his things from her apartment, and it feels good to finally relax with Sam. \u201cHe keeps saying he doesn\u2019t understand why we broke up. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell him I was <em>bored</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat can\u2019t have been the only reason,\u201d Sam probes, and Lena frowns.</p>\n<p>Maybe there were other reasons.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just so\u2026I don\u2019t know. He was a good guy. Kind, affectionate. There just wasn\u2019t a spark. And don\u2019t get me started on the sex.\u201d Lena rests her elbows on the table, massaging her temples.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat bad huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I ever really <em>get there</em> with anyone, but it\u2019s still frustrating.\u201d</p>\n<p>James had just been so\u2026standard. He had gotten so dejected when Lena admitted that he didn't make her come that she just started faking it, and pretending to enjoy herself got to be exhausting. His cologne made her wince, and while he had a fairly varied set of moves, none of them ever worked for Lena.</p>\n<p>Granted, <em>no</em>\u00a0man\u2019s moves have ever worked on Lena, but she pushes that thought aside. She\u2019s deep enough in thought over it that she almost doesn\u2019t notice Sam choke on her tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait. You don\u2019t \u2013 what do you mean, you don\u2019t <em>get there</em>?\u201d Sam asks, dabbing at her chin with a napkin and narrowing her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Lena blushes, stirring her cappuccino awkwardly with her pinkie. \u201cOrgasm. I just don\u2019t\u2026do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t orgasm.\u201d Sam says flatly, looking increasingly horrified. Lena starts to feel more and more self-conscious about her admission, shifting in her chair with badly-concealed discomfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cEVER?\u201d </em>Sam practically shouts, and Lena jumps at the volume.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh, Sam, keep your voice down!\u201d Lena hisses, looking around furtively \u2013 a few people have glanced over, but their attention moves on quickly. \u201cCan we not <em>yell</em> about my sex life in a public place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam nods, looking terribly concerned, and lowers her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just \u2013 <em>none</em> of the guys you\u2019ve dated have ever made you come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, okay?\u201d Lena whispers, her face starting to get hot. \u201cNone of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Lena, sweetie. Please tell me you at least take care of it yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013\u201c Lena stutters, her face now flushing crimson. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to \u2013 I don\u2019t know how -\u201c</p>\n<p>Sam gapes at her, flabbergasted. \u201cLena, oh my <em>god</em>. Have you <em>ever</em> had an orgasm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 there was one time that maybe, I think \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, if there\u2019s any doubt, then the answer is no,\u201d Sam sighs, leaning back in her chair, and Lena crosses her arms over her torso protectively. She certainly wasn\u2019t expecting this strange conversation when she agreed to meet for coffee, and it\u2019s throwing off her entire day.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that really so weird?\u201d Lena argues, trying to seem nonchalant. \u201cLots of women don\u2019t have an orgasm every time. Some people never do. I\u2019ve read studies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you have,\u201d Sam says, sighing. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve never tried it by yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt\u2026I don\u2019t know, turned on enough, I suppose.\u201d Lena focuses on precisely folding the napkin in front of her into neat squares to distract herself, and Sam waits patiently. When it gets too tight to fold, she drops it and finally voices a fear that she\u2019s been harboring ever since she broke up with Jack when she was 22. \u201cMaybe\u2026maybe I\u2019m just built wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sam looks at her intensely for a few moments, her expression unreadable, and Lena averts her gaze. She stares at the table instead, scratching at a small hole in the wood with her thumbnail. Finally, Sam seems to come to a decision - she leans forward, putting her hand over Lena\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re built just fine, honey. But maybe you just need someone to show you what good sex can be like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena laughs nervously, pulling her hand back gently. \u201cWhat, are <em>you</em> going to do it? I don\u2019t think Alex would like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Sam is already pulling out her phone, and Lena\u2019s insides clench with nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not me. Alex\u2019s little sister is single, and I think you\u2019ll like her,\u201d Sam says, already tapping at her screen. Lena feels an inexplicable panic wash over her.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Her</em>? Sam, I\u2019m not gay,\u201d Lena says loudly and probably a little too fast. Sam rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em>, Lena. You\u2019ve assured me of that several times over the course of our friendship,\u201d Sam says, a twinkle in her eye. \u201cBut in those studies you read, did it not say that gay women have proportionately more orgasms than straight women? Why do you think that is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena stays silent. It\u2019s true \u2013 all of the studies she had read, after the first few months with her first boyfriend Jack had been proving fruitless, <em>did</em> say that women with female partners had the highest percentage of orgasms. Sam knows exactly how to sway her \u2013 with facts, and data, and persuasive argument \u2013 and she finds herself starting to consider it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be into it, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s going to be an awkward night for both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, it won\u2019t be much different than your other sexual encounters, will it? Consider it an experiment.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fair point. At least with a woman, she won\u2019t feel obligated to go through with it for the sake of the other person. And besides, Sam is impossible to dissuade once she has an idea in her head. Lena figures it\u2019ll probably be easier to just meet this woman, deal with the awkwardness, and prove that the idea didn\u2019t work rather than try talk her out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. But you\u2019ll be getting a text afterwards saying \u2018I told you so\u2019. Go ahead and ask her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, because I already sent the message. Smile, I need to send her a picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSam!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>What the hell do you wear for a pre-planned casual hookup with a woman?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Lena rifles through her closet for what feels like the hundredth time, grabbing both a tight red dress and a slacks-and-blouse combination. She holds them against herself in the mirror one at a time, frowning at the result. <em>Too dressy. I feel like an expensive call-girl.</em> They go back into the closet, and she pulls out a simple pair of leggings and a tank top instead. <em>Ugh. Now I look like I\u2019m going to the gym.</em></p>\n<p>In all honesty, she has no idea why she cares so much. She\u2019s been telling herself all week that she has no intention of actually sleeping with this woman \u2013 who, in her opinion, agreed to this strange liaison alarmingly quickly \u2013 so in theory, she could wear her pyjamas and it wouldn\u2019t matter. But instead, she\u2019s been trying and eliminating outfits for 45 minutes. After spending over an hour showering and styling her hair to be silky and straight, another 20 applying and re-applying makeup, and a full hour and a half getting waxed earlier today.</p>\n<p>But she <em>isn\u2019t</em> going to sleep with her, so it doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>Finally she decides on jeans and a soft purple sweater \u2013 the kind of thing that she\u2019d wear to hang out with Sam. If she\u2019s going to have an awkward makeout-session-turned-rejection with Sam\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s younger sister (god knows that\u2019s a tangled web she\u2019s already regretting getting herself into), she might as well be wearing comfortable clothes.</p>\n<p>If she decides to throw on her nicest pair of matching lace underwear last-minute, that\u2019s her business. It\u2019s not like anyone is going to see them. It's just a confidence thing.</p>\n<p>She applies her light perfume, touches up her lipstick, and, on a whim, cuts her fingernails. About halfway through it she stops, wondering why on earth the idea came over her, but she keeps going \u2013 she might as well finish \u2013 and files them for good measure. Finally, she\u2019s left pacing her kitchen as the clock slowly ticks towards 7:00.</p>\n<p>At exactly 6:52 her intercom buzzes, and she rushes over to it, her heart pounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss Luthor, I have a Miss Danvers waiting for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSend her up, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two-minute wait while her not-quite-date makes her way from the lobby to Lena\u2019s apartment is excruciating, and no matter how many times Lena tells herself that she has no reason to care, she still fusses with her hair in the mirror while she waits. Finally there\u2019s a decisive knock, and she has to clutch the edge of her kitchen island to rein in the impulse to run to the door.</p>\n<p>She walks there slowly instead, her heels clacking on the shiny hardwood floor, and takes a fortifying breath as she puts her hand on the doorknob. When she opens it, the breath immediately leaves her in a rush.</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t been sure exactly what to expect in terms of appearance. When she asked what Kara looked like \u2013 purely out of objective curiosity, since her attractiveness doesn\u2019t matter, since Lena won\u2019t be sleeping with her \u2013 Sam\u2019s only reply had been \u2018<em>really cute, but not as cute as Alex\u2019</em>. Lena figured that Sam was a little biased, but honestly, her under-selling of this woman borders on <em>criminal</em>.</p>\n<p>The woman standing in her doorway is, to put it bluntly, fucking <em>hot</em>. She\u2019s leaning casually against the doorframe, one foot crossed behind the other, with her hands in the pockets of her skinny slacks. She looks sharp without being too dressy \u2013 her thick-soled boots are well-worn but not dirty, her polka-dotted shirt is tucked into her belted pants and slightly unbuttoned, and the strap of a small messenger bag crosses her chest. Her hair is long and blonde, loose and simple, and Lena can\u2019t detect any makeup besides a glossy lip balm. If Lena was interested in women, she\u2019d probably be throwing herself at this girl, with her soft-looking lips and her strong shoulders and her enchanting, spicy perfume.</p>\n<p>Not that Lena usually notices things like that. Since Kara is the only thing to look at, it\u2019s natural for Lena to pick out her features. And stare at them. And feel her heartbeat start to race.</p>\n<p>As if she can hear it too, Kara grins, holding out a hand. Lena\u2019s heart skips another beat at the way the sunny smile makes her eyes crinkle at the edges.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! I\u2019m Kara.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLena,\u201d she manages, as Kara takes her hand in a warm shake. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI usually am,\u201d Kara says easily, pushing herself off the doorframe and rubbing her hands together. \u201cI had some pretty good motivation today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena flushes, clearing her throat. <em>Get a grip. This is just to get Sam off my back.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like to come inside?\u201d Lena asks, opening the door wider and inviting Kara in. She has several bottles of wine, two types of beer, and a selection of whiskeys at the ready, to cover all her hostess bases. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out, she wants to be able to offer Kara something.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I thought maybe we could go out first? I figured that meeting and then getting right down to it would be a little\u2026impersonal,\u201d Kara suggests, staying put in the hallway. Lena blinks, struggling to adjust to the new suggestion. Her first instinct is to say no, to insist that Kara just coming inside and having a drink and getting right to it is so much easier, but there\u2019s a hopefulness in Kara\u2019s face that she doesn\u2019t have the heart to douse just yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. Just let me grab my coat.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they exit the building Lena looks around, wondering what Kara drives, but Kara just holds out an arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe place is just a few streets away. I figured we could walk, if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Surprised again, Lena nods, slipping her arm into Kara\u2019s and heading towards the nearby intersection. They make small talk for a few streets \u2013 Lena reveals that she hasn\u2019t actually met Alex yet, and Kara laughs, assuring her that she\u2019s only met Sam twice so far.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was surprised when she texted me. And I have to say, the picture Sam sent me did <em>not</em> prepare me for how beautiful you are in real life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena lets out an embarrassing sound, somewhere between a laugh and a snort. \u201cThat\u2019s, um. Very sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d Kara\u2019s clear blue eyes meet Lena\u2019s, and her expression is so genuine that Lena has to look away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly prepared for you, either,\u201d Lena finds herself saying, and Kara grins, squeezing her arm lightly.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh my god, am I flirting? </em>\n</p>\n<p>Before she can fully investigate that strange revelation, Kara is guiding her towards a half-hidden streetside door and into a cozy-looking bar. Kara doesn\u2019t bother to wait for a server to acknowledge them \u2013 she just grabs two menus and waves at the bartender, a tall barrel-chested man with a stoic expression, pointing to her left.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, J\u2019onn! Window seat taken?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours,\u201d he nods, cracking a smile. Lena follows Kara to their table, trying to hide her smile as Kara pulls her chair out for her. A short woman with a curly brown bob yells from across the room, already starting to fill a pint glass from one of the beer taps.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Kara! I\u2019ll bring your usual in just a minute. Who\u2019s your pretty friend?\u201d she says with a wink, and Kara blushes, rubbing her neck. Kara waves back, and hands Lena a menu. She herself doesn\u2019t look at one \u2013 Lena can assume that whatever she usually orders is on the way.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you come here often?\u201d Lena jokes, as yet another server waves hello at Kara. She laughs, the sound making Lena\u2019s chest flutter. <em>What the hell is going on today?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, this is my favourite bar. Alex and I practically live here. It\u2019s pretty lucky that you live so close by!\u201d</p>\n<p>The female server turns up with Kara\u2019s beer, interrupting their conversation, and Lena finds herself slightly irritated. As much as she had doubted this was a good idea, she\u2019d been enjoying listening to Kara talk.</p>\n<p>The waitress redeems herself slightly with a friendly smile, holding her hand out for Lena to shake. \u201cSince Kara is clearly not going to introduce us, I\u2019m Lucy. Has she told you the ridiculous amount of money she spends here yet? You might run for the hills.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena chuckles, and Kara just shrugs good-naturedly. She orders a gin and tonic for herself, and on Lucy\u2019s recommendations, they order a few appetizers to share.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara\u2019s special potstickers are on the way, but she never shares those,\u201d Lucy jokes, leaving them to make Lena\u2019s drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do so! I let Alex have one last week!\u201d Kara calls after her, indignant. Lucy just waves her off, and Kara finally settles in her seat, leaning back and grinning. As the drinks and food start to come, Lena hardly notices the time passing \u2013 the conversation flows easily between them, and the two gin and tonics make her feel relaxed, but not quite tipsy. When they finally leave (Kara insisting on paying the tab, since she suggested going out in the first place), Lena doesn\u2019t even bother to correct Lucy when she tells them to enjoy the rest of their \u2018date\u2019.</p>\n<p>The part of her brain that spent the last few days in a whirlwind of panic and self-justification seems to have finally shut down, and she finds herself simply enjoying Kara\u2019s company. They walk back to Lena\u2019s building arm in arm, their shoulders brushing and Lena surreptitiously enjoying the flex of Kara\u2019s biceps, and it seems like only a few seconds before they\u2019re standing in front of the lobby doors. Kara steps back slightly, leaving a respectable distance between them, and Lena misses her warmth immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Lena \u2013 I\u2019ve had a really good time so far. I think you\u2019re kind of incredible, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena blushes, and Kara continues. \u201cBut I know this is probably sort of a weird night for you. So if you want me to go now, I will. We had a nice night, and we can leave it at that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena swallows. Kara \u2013 sweet, concerned, conscientious Kara \u2013 is giving her the perfect out. A way to avoid any awkwardness, and even be able to keep up some kind of friendship. She really has had a great time so far, and it\u2019s been a long time since she felt this kind of easy interaction with anyone but Sam. She isn\u2019t exactly swimming in friends, and it\u2019s not like this is going to go anywhere, since she\u2019s not gay. She should take it.</p>\n<p>She opens her mouth to do so, but what comes out is the opposite, in a surprisingly confident voice that she hardly recognizes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to come upstairs for a drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>After a pause, Kara grins brilliantly, and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She holds out an arm and Lena takes it, leading them past the doorman and into the elevators.</p>\n<p>The ride up to her floor seems longer than usual \u2013 her arm is still looped through Kara\u2019s, but the contact suddenly seems closer than it did before. She can smell Kara\u2019s perfume \u2013 <em>is it cologne? Whatever it is, it smells amazing \u2013 </em>and she\u2019s hyperaware of the softness of skin where her fingers brush Kara\u2019s wrist. Her hands shake slightly as she turns the key and ushers Kara inside, and she\u2019s grateful that the blonde seems to get distracted by the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the city skyline in her living room \u2013 it gives her the opportunity to take a few deep breaths.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Just because she\u2019s up here doesn\u2019t mean anything is going to happen. We can just have a drink, maybe kiss for a minute to prove I\u2019m not into her. Maybe a bit of grinding on the couch. That\u2019s it \u2013</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a gorgeous view,\u201d Kara interrupts her musing, silhouetted by the glow of the surrounding buildings.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I took the apartment,\u201d Lena admits, handing Kara a beer and sipping her own scotch. Kara nods, taking a slow drink and then setting her bottle down on the table. She turns to Lena, a small smile on her face. Lena fidgets with her glass under the intense gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to say something corny like \u2018this view is better\u2019, are you?\u201d Lena jokes, trying to deflect her own nervousness. Kara just smiles, moving closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Walked right into that one.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Kara moves closer again and Lena swallows, her hand clutching her glass like a lifeline. Gently Kara eases it from her grasp, setting it next to her bottle on the table. Her body feels foreign to her \u2013 her hands feel jumpy, like she wants to grab onto something, and there\u2019s a low throbbing starting up between her legs that only seems to make the tightness in her belly worse. Somehow, Kara standing close to her and staring at her <em>like that</em> is doing something uniquely physical to her body, and she isn\u2019t sure that she wants to open the Pandora\u2019s box of investigating why that is.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to stop, please tell me,\u201d Kara murmurs, putting a soft hand on Lena\u2019s hip. \u201cIf I do anything wrong, or you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable, or if \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena is almost as surprised as Kara is when she cuts the speech off with a kiss.</p>\n<p>She isn\u2019t sure why she did it \u2013 at the time, she\u2019d been watching Kara\u2019s mouth and thinking about how soft it looked. Kara was being so considerate, and through Lena\u2019s head like a mantra was the phrase <em>get it over with, just get it over with</em> \u2013 and then they\u2019re kissing, and everything goes blank.</p>\n<p>Kara freezes for a moment, her hands hovering a few inches from Lena\u2019s waist \u2013 but as Lena relaxes into the embrace, so does she, and she slides them over Lena\u2019s hips to pull them closer together. The kiss is chaste at first, just a pressing of closed lips, with Lena\u2019s hands curled into the collar of Kara\u2019s shirt; but as they both relax, their mouths separating for a moment, it eases into something more intimate. Lena can feel the places where their lips cling together, lipstick melding with gloss, and Kara\u2019s breath washes over her mouth and all her nervous thoughts and denials disappear. Her hands slide to rest against Kara\u2019s skin, one on her neck and the other slipping under her shirt to spread out over her breastbone, and she can feel Kara\u2019s pulse hammering almost as hard as her own. All she can think about is leaning forward again.</p>\n<p>Kara does it for her, in the end. One hand slides against her lower back, slipping under her shirt to touch the heated skin underneath, and Lena gasps at the sparks that rush through her at such a simple touch. The gasp means that her mouth is slightly open as their lips meet again, and Kara\u2019s tongue swipes over her lower lip and her teeth follow to scrape gently over the sensitive skin and <em>sweet <strong>fuck</strong>, is this what kissing is supposed to feel like?</em></p>\n<p>Following Kara\u2019s lead she tilts her head and slides her tongue briefly along Kara\u2019s and god, she can feel it <em>everywhere</em>. The hand on her lower back slides up and up until it slips under her bra strap and then back down, without even trying to unclip her bra like she\u2019s used to men doing, and it\u2019s like a trail of fire \u2013 her heart is pounding and her clit is throbbing like it never has before and Kara\u2019s tongue is doing something in her mouth that feels fucking incredible. She\u2019s spent hours kissing men and never felt anything close to what 45 seconds of contact with Kara has done to her.</p>\n<p>Kara gently scrapes short nails over her back and she whimpers, arching into the sensation. There\u2019s a jolt as her chest rubs against Kara\u2019s \u2013 <em>god, my nipples are hard, I can <strong>feel</strong> her</em> \u2013 and then in a whirlwind few seconds she\u2019s on her back on the couch, Kara suspended over her on flexing arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this okay? Are you -\u201c Kara starts, lifting herself up so that she isn\u2019t pinning Lena to the cushions. In response, Lena spreads her legs wide and hooks one over Kara\u2019s hip, pulling her flush and arching.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, shh. Just kiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Let it not be said that Kara can\u2019t follow instructions. Immediately her weight is on Lena, pressing her into the couch as their lips connect again with hot, open-mouthed kisses. Lena pants into her mouth as Kara grinds her hips slowly forward, sending white-hot jolts up Lena\u2019s spine. This is all so new, there\u2019s a pressure building in her abdomen that she can\u2019t explain, she feels like she\u2019s climbing towards an unfamiliar peak and she has no idea how to get there. All she can do is cling to Kara and let it sweep her away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to go to the bedroom?\u201d Kara whispers, biting at Lena\u2019s neck and making her hips jump. She\u2019s always scolded boyfriends for biting too hard or leaving marks, but now she\u2019s arching into the pain \u2013 it feels <em>good</em>, it makes her feel hot and dirty and <em>wet</em> and she wants proof of this crazy, incredible feeling on her body after this is over.</p>\n<p><em>Do you want to go to the bedroom? </em>The words hit her fully, and they go straight between her thighs. She imagines Kara pressing her into her white sheets, both of them naked, Kara\u2019s bare thigh slipping between her own -</p>\n<p>\n<em>God, I do. I want her to fuck me.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The voice that\u2019s existed in the back of her head since she can remember - the one that\u2019s always justified every second look at a woman as admiration or jealousy, the one that encouraged her to pursue boys who made her feel nothing, the one that almost convinced her to cancel this ridiculous, amazing date \u2013 for the first time in her life, it\u2019s quiet. There\u2019s just Kara, her mouth hot and wet against Lena\u2019s neck and her hips rocking rhythmically and her sweet, light cologne making Lena\u2019s chest flutter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena breathes, closing her eyes and giving in. <em>\u201cYes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s legs brace against the ground and a hand slips under Lena\u2019s ass and then she\u2019s straddling Kara, her hips spread wide over Kara\u2019s thighs. She feels remarkably light, but even so, she gasps when Kara stands up and takes Lena with her. She wraps her legs around Kara\u2019s hips instinctively, Kara\u2019s hands hooking under her thighs to hold her up \u2013 <em>Jack always said I was too heavy, how is she</em> \u2013 but Kara carries her towards the hallway easily, continuing her assault on Lena\u2019s neck and jaw as she goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich door?\u201d Kara pants, pressing Lena against a wall. A framed picture falls and Lena hears a crack, but it\u2019s the last thing on her mind \u2013 Kara has braced her knee against the wall to help hold her up, and her taut thigh is proving the perfect surface for her to <em>rub</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cEnd of the hall,\u201d Lena manages, and Kara picks her up again, shouldering the door open. She doesn\u2019t spare a glance for Lena\u2019s well-decorated bedroom or the huge windows on the opposite wall overlooking the bay \u2013 she just presses Lena into the soft duvet, and Lena weaves her fingers into blonde hair and pulls their lips together for another messy kiss. It falls like a curtain around them, blocking out the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Throwing caution to the wind, she starts undoing the buttons of Kara\u2019s shirt with shockingly steady hands. When it hangs open she slides her hands under it to grasp Kara\u2019s back, feeling the muscle shift as Kara works to free her arms. Lena watches as she removes her belt as well, her abs flexing. She starts on the button of her pants, but stops to look up at Lena \u2013 her gaze is questioning, and Lena acknowledges it as a request for permission.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s slowed down to really consider what she\u2019s doing since they started kissing. She takes stock of herself \u2013 her sweater is rucked up over her stomach, her hair is probably a mess, and she can tell that her neck is already a landscape of reddish marks. She\u2019s so wet that she can feel her underwear clinging to her, she can feel it on her inner thighs as they rub together. For the first time, the lubricant she keeps in the bedside drawer is completely unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Lena is turned on. Almost painfully so, her clit throbbing and her nipples almost chafing against her bra. She\u2019s finally close to whatever it is people always rave about when it comes to sex, and she can\u2019t fathom stopping.</p>\n<p>She nods slowly, biting her lip, and Kara pulls her sports bra off and throws it to the floor. Lena only gets a few moments to admire her \u2013 she\u2019s all lean muscle and smooth skin and boxer briefs, but Lena can see a jagged scar that runs over her chest and ribs \u2013 before Kara is on her again, kissing and nipping at Lena\u2019s stomach and undoing her jeans.</p>\n<p>The sheer awe on Kara\u2019s face as she removes the layers of Lena\u2019s clothing is almost enough to quell her usual anxiety at being naked with another person. Kara strips her quickly but, somehow, it\u2019s incredibly erotic to watch her smooth her hands and lips reverently over the revealed skin. She spends a few minutes lavishing attention on Lena\u2019s nipples, sucking indulgently until Lena is squirming and spreading her legs even wider. She squeezes Lena\u2019s thighs and nuzzles the soft swell of her belly, making her smile, and Lena just threads her fingers through Kara\u2019s hair, scratching gently at her scalp and letting her explore.</p>\n<p>Somehow, she feels more comfortable with Kara after three hours than she ever has with long-term boyfriends.</p>\n<p>Eventually Kara seems to settle between Lena\u2019s legs, kiss-swollen lips trailing over the soaked material of Lena\u2019s panties.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara \u2013 you don\u2019t have to. That never really works for me, so don\u2019t bother \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Kara just grins, sliding the fabric down Lena\u2019s legs and tossing it aside. \u201cDo you mind if I try?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2013 no, I guess not. I just, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to,\u201d Kara counters, kissing Lena\u2019s inner thighs. \u201cI like it. I want to taste you. If that's okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena feels herself clench at that. <em>She likes it. She wants to. </em>Her exes had always acted like it was a chore, and gotten frustrated when their sloppy efforts hadn\u2019t yielded results. Kara, at least, seems like she\u2019ll enjoy herself even if Lena doesn\u2019t come.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara shifts forward, her shoulders guiding Lena\u2019s legs further apart, and gets to work.</p>\n<p>The first few passes feel nicer than usual - Kara\u2019s tongue is gentle and exploratory, rather than forceful \u2013 but like always, there\u2019s no jolt. No toe-curling pleasure, like she knows there\u2019s supposed to be. Her heart sinks.</p>\n<p>\n<em>I guess it\u2019s official. I\u2019m just broken. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Just as she\u2019s about to ask Kara to stop, her tongue slides upwards and Lena feels it. It\u2019s only a moment, but it\u2019s there \u2013 the same deep pull as before, when Kara was grinding their hips together, but concentrated. It zips through her like lightning, and her hips jump.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFuck!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Between her legs, Kara grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d she murmurs, and with that she hooks her hands under Lena\u2019s thighs and dives back in.</p>\n<p>Like a switch has been flipped, Kara locates whatever magic button made Lena feel that way and makes it <em>dance</em>. Lena\u2019s hips buck so violently that Kara has to sling an arm over her hipbones and hold her down, but Lena can\u2019t comprehend making her body stay still \u2013 she\u2019s full of it, this lightning feeling, and she needs <em>more</em>. Her hand clenches hard in Kara\u2019s hair, her heels dig into her back, and she can\u2019t stop the stream of desperate words spilling from her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod \u2013 Kara, fuck, what are you <em>doing</em>, that\u2019s so \u2013 that\u2019s so good, you\u2019re so <em>good</em>, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop, <em>don\u2019t stop</em> -\u201c</p>\n<p>Why Kara might stop she has no idea, but the idea is unacceptable. The distinctly tight, coiled feeling from earlier is back with a vengeance, and she can feel herself on the edge of <em>something</em> \u2013 it\u2019s right there, within reach, and she wants it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet go, baby, just let go - I want you to come,\u201d Kara rasps, and the pet name makes her heat up even more \u2013 and then Kara lowers her mouth again she swirls her tongue and then <em>sucks</em>, and the pressure is so good, <em>it\u2019s so good</em> \u2013</p>\n<p>Just like that, Lena flies over the edge of that unknown cliff and into <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>The pressure in her belly breaks, and her toes curl as she cries out wordlessly. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s mindblowing, it\u2019s <em>perfect</em> \u2013 it\u2019s like pure relief condensed into a physical feeling. It rushes through her like a tsunami, crashing in waves as Kara\u2019s tongue softens its attention and guides her through. She can hear high, needy cries echoing through the quiet of her apartment, and it\u2019s only when the waves start to ease that she realizes that her throat is hoarse. Her thighs shake uncontrollably on Kara\u2019s shoulders, and as her comprehension slowly returns to her, she wonders how on earth she lived so long without this.</p>\n<p>Kara finally abandons her still-pulsing clit and climbs up to Lena\u2019s level, and Lena pulls her in for a hard kiss \u2013 Kara\u2019s face is still slick, and she tastes strange but undeniably <em>good</em>. She never would have considered kissing her own come from another woman\u2019s face a turn-on before tonight, but as she sinks her teeth into Kara\u2019s lower lip, she feels a long-ignored part of herself opening up. She\u2019s still high on her first orgasm, naked and spread open under an incredibly hot woman with her own come smeared on her face from their deep kisses, and she already wants more.</p>\n<p>Like she can read Lena\u2019s mind, Kara pulls back slightly and wiggles her hips between Lena\u2019s, pressing gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you go again?\u201d Kara asks, grinning, and it\u2019s like Lena never came \u2013 she\u2019s desperate and wanting again, and she nods frantically.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, godpleaseyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s hand slides between their bodies, and Lena is guiding her fingers inside before Kara can even ask for permission. Like oral, fingering has never done anything for her \u2013 it\u2019s always felt token, like her partners were just getting it out of the way before the \u2018good part\u2019 \u2013 but, like oral, she\u2019s eager for Kara to prove her wrong.</p>\n<p>Kara fucks her with two fingers, and then three, and when she slips her thumb upwards and uses her hips to grind it into Lena\u2019s clit she starts to feel that pressure building again even stronger than before. Kara is doing something with her fingertips \u2013 rather than just fucking her she\u2019s curling and probing on every thrust, like she\u2019s looking for something. Finally, she presses <em>just so </em>and in seconds Lena skyrockets from a 7 to an 11 \u2013 Kara grins victoriously, braces herself on the mattress, and fucks into the spot in earnest, and in seconds Lena\u2019s vision whites out as she comes all over Kara\u2019s hand with a surprised cry.</p>\n<p>Lena is just starting to recover when Kara starts kissing her way down her body again, murmuring all the way in a surprisingly shaky voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2018re so \u2013 you\u2019re so fucking beautiful, god, Lena \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Kara buries her face between Lena\u2019s thighs again, sucking her clit like it\u2019s her last meal, and shoves her free hand into her own boxers. Lena, unable to do anything but spread her legs and cling to Kara\u2019s shoulders for dear life, has to slap a hand over her own mouth to muffle the noises that follow. When Lena comes in her mouth, Kara groans almost as loudly as Lena does while her fingers work frantically over her own clit.</p>\n<p>Lena can\u2019t think \u2013 she can barely even breathe. Three times in one night, and as soon as the last orgasm eases she\u2019s craving more. It\u2019s almost decadent, having the sharpness of her newfound desire taken care of so quickly and with such obvious enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Kara comes back up again, kissing her hard and messy, and Lena whimpers at her next words.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I don't want to stop - I wanna fuck you again. Can I try something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>She\u2019s going to kill me. This is how I die.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do anything you want to me, just make me come again \u2013\u201c Lena gasps, and Kara springs up from the bed and roots around in her messenger bag. Lena exhales shakily, overcome with a strange urge to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I wasn\u2019t expecting you to <em>leave</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara just grins, pulling something out of the bag. It\u2019s a mess of black straps, attached to a small piece of leather with a metal ring \u2013</p>\n<p>Oh<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t have one,\u201d Kara says, holding up her other hand \u2013 a fair-sized purple dildo, with a flat base to secure it to the harness.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were right about that,\u201d Lena breathes, and Kara slips off her boxer briefs before stepping into the straps, tightening them around her hips and slipping the toy into the ring. It looks almost silly \u2013 a big purple dildo sticking straight out of Kara\u2019s narrow hips \u2013 but then Kara is crawling up the bed to settle between Lena\u2019s hips and the toy drags sinfully against her clit and suddenly the silliness ebbs away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s gone completely a few minutes later, when Kara has both hands on Lena\u2019s hips and her thrusts are slamming the headboard into the wall. Lena finds her own clit for the first time at Kara\u2019s instruction, and she chokes off a scream as she rubs herself into the most intense orgasm yet. She\u2019s fairly sure that it isn\u2019t possible to come any harder \u2013 at least, she\u2019s sure until Kara flips her over and she\u2019s taking all 6 inches from behind, biting the pillow as Kara\u2019s fingers hone in on her most sensitive spots like a magnet.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lena tries to tap out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t go again, it\u2019s not possible \u2013\u201c It\u2019s overwhelming, all these new sensations, and Lena feels like she\u2019s entered a whole new world of possibility with how Kara guides her body into pleasure. Her experience with sex before this had been to wait until the man she was with had his requisite single orgasm and then try to get on with her night - she has no idea how much her body can actually take.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Kara pulls her close, nipping at her ear and encouraging her in a low voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you can. Can I try?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena acquiesces enthusiastically, eager to see Kara live up to her word. Twice more, in fact, bringing the final tally up to 7 by the time she blinks herself back into awareness. She\u2019s tingly and slightly numb below the waist, and every muscle in her body feels relaxed and satisfied.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Okay. Maybe I'm a little bit gay.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Kara, still breathing hard, eases the straps of the harness down her legs and throws it in the direction of her bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Lena says, still working on getting her legs to stop shaking. \u201cSo\u2026that\u2019s what that\u2019s supposed to feel like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara laughs, clutching her abs and wincing. \u201cOw. God, I think you broke me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> broke <em>you</em>?\u201d Lena asks incredulously, gesturing downwards. \u201cI can\u2019t feel anything below my hips!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work,\u201d Kara winks, and Lena rolls her eyes at the faux-cockiness. Lena settles back down and looks up at the ceiling, and Kara\u2019s face grows more serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need me to go?\u201d Kara asks, no hesitation in her voice. \u201cI get it if you need some time alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d Lena asks hesitantly. She doesn\u2019t want Kara to feel like she\u2019s being thrown out, but she really does need some time to think about the strange turn her life has taken in the last few hours.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is. I like you, Lena. I want you to be comfortable.\u201d Kara\u2019s smile is easy, and she rolls out of bed, pulling her discarded pants back on. Lena watches her re-dress, leaving her shirt untucked and her hair mussed, not moving from her spread-out position on the bed. To be honest, she isn\u2019t entirely sure she could get up if she tried.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll find my way out. Text me, if you feel up to it \u2013 I\u2019d really love to see you again.\u201d Kara runs her fingers through her messy hair, looking around to make sure she hasn\u2019t forgotten anything \u2013 and then with a surprisingly slow, heartfelt goodbye kiss, Kara is gone. Lena hears the soft click of the door closing as she leaves the apartment, and it feels surprisingly lonely all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes Lena just lies in bed, still naked and deliciously sore. She should be thinking through the events of the night \u2013 she <em>knows</em> she should \u2013 but instead she just smiles, turns over, hugs the nearest pillow, and falls into a stress-free sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lena wakes up the next morning feeling alarmingly cheerful. Strangely, her first thoughts are somewhere along the lines of \u2018today will be a good day\u2019 \u2013 something she hasn\u2019t thought in months, as she\u2019s been working more or less around the clock during this acquisition. She has to go into work today, in fact, but the happy bubble doesn\u2019t burst even as she gets into her car and heads to the office.</p>\n<p>While the driver eases them into rush hour traffic opens her messages with Sam, reading the last one sent \u2013 it\u2019s from Sam, dated 11:56pm last night.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Sam]: So, am I getting an \u2018I told you so\u2019 text?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lena hesitates with her answer, typing and re-typing until she finally just hits send.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Lena]: Is lesbian sex always that good?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Seconds later, her phone vibrates, and she snorts as she reads the message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Sam]: IT ABSOLUTELY IS!!! AND ALSO HOW WAS IT, TELL ME EVERYTHING</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Lena]: It was incredible, not that you need to know that. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The speech bubble pops up immediately, and Lena smiles. She normally isn\u2019t prone to talking about such intensely private things, but she\u2019s bursting at the seams to talk to <em>someone </em>about her experience last night, if only to figure out how <em>she</em> feels about it. She tells Sam more or less everything \u2013 she leaves out the specifics, but includes the number of orgasms and Kara\u2019s unquestionable skill in bed \u2013 and in response, Sam sends one message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Sam]: That\u2019s my girl!!!!!!!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lena isn\u2019t sure whether Sam is referring to her, or to Kara. Either way, she gets sidetracked when the car arrives at L-Corp, sweeping her up into morning meetings.</p>\n<p>Through each of them she manages to focus, but every time there\u2019s a lull, her mind slips back to last night. How Kara felt, so warm and solid on top of her; Kara\u2019s tongue on her clit, bringing forth the electric feeling that she\u2019s chased her whole life with just a few strokes; Kara behind her, one hand in her hair and the other on her hip, telling her to come. More than once she has to excuse herself to dab cold water on her face in her private bathroom, waiting for the arousal to subside.</p>\n<p>By lunchtime, she\u2019s practically twitching.</p>\n<p>Finally she gives in, and pulls out her phone. Sam had put Kara's number in there before they even had their date, and now she's staring at her contact entry like it holds the secrets of the universe.<em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>I should just text her. She said she wanted me to. </em>\n</p>\n<p>After 5 full minutes of deliberation, she settles on the most neutral greeting possible.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Lena]: Hey.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>She puts the phone face-down on her desk and tries to get back to work, but it taunts her \u2013 she moves it to a desk drawer, and finally she\u2019s about to shove it into her purse when it vibrates. She almost drops it in her haste to check the message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Kara]: You need it again already huh?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s entire body flushes. She huffs, throwing the phone into her purse and then immediately digging it out again to glare at the message. Before she can concoct the perfect rant to send back, another message comes in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Kara]: Sorry, I was joking! I\u2019m realizing you don\u2019t know me that well, and sarcasm doesn\u2019t come across in text. I\u2019m really glad you messaged me</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lena deflates immediately, slightly embarrassed at her reaction. She taps out a reply, sending it before she can second guess herself.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Lena]: Well, since my intention was to invite you over tonight, you weren\u2019t exactly wrong.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, the text bubble pops up again, and the next message comes through. It makes Lena laugh genuinely, and through the glass of her door she can see her secretary look up from her work, startled at the unfamiliar sound.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Kara]: \u2026can we get food after? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lena leaves work early for the first time in months so that she can wash her sheets and get into comfortable, easy-to-remove clothes \u2013 by the time Kara knocks on her door, she\u2019s almost vibrating.</p>\n<p>She opens the door, and before Kara can open her mouth Lena\u2019s pulling her in by her skinny tie, slamming the door and pressing herself fully to the length of Kara\u2019s body. She pulls her gradually down the hallway, refusing to let their lips separate, and a few orgasms later Kara is almost as sated as she is \u2013 as inexperienced as she might be, Lena is nothing if not a fast learner. They order pizza and Kara puts on Lena\u2019s tiny silk robe to pay the delivery guy, bringing it back to the bedroom so they can eat it in bed. Kara tells her about Alex, about being adopted by the Danvers, and Lena opens up a bit about her own family issues. They talk about favourite movies (The Little Mermaid for Kara, Star Wars for Lena), Lena\u2019s friendship with Sam, and each of their careers.</p>\n<p>When only a few crusts remain in the box, Kara sets it on the bedside table and tugs Lena close to her again with a grin. She kisses her deeply, and Lena feels the pull \u2013 she\u2019s sure that at some point it must run out, but it shows no sign of stopping so far.</p>\n<p>\u201cI taste like pepperoni,\u201d Lena argues weakly, already moving her hips against Kara\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my favourite food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d Lena asks later, sweaty and trembling as Kara flops onto her back and stretches out, cracking her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve never \u2013 I didn\u2019t think I could feel that way. I thought I was just\u2026built wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not built wrong,\u201d Kara says, frowning. She wiggles until her front is flush with Lena\u2019s side, propping herself up on an elbow and tracing soft patterns on her stomach. \u201cWho told you that? Besides, you just have a small clit. It wasn\u2019t that hard to find. Whoever made you feel that way is clearly just shitty in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, Lena feels hot tears welling in her eyes at the validation. Mortified, she shuts them immediately but despite her efforts they manage to escape anyways, sliding down her temples and into her hair. <em>God, stop it, stop crying \u2013</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kara asks softly, her warm hand splaying out protectively over Lena\u2019s ribs. The light, comforting pressure and the lack of judgement in Kara\u2019s tone release something in Lena\u2019s chest, and before she can stop herself she\u2019s crying \u2013 full, hot tears spill out, and her breath comes in short sobs. Immediately Kara pulls her close, and Lena buries her face into her neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. You\u2019re perfect, Lena. You\u2019re <em>so</em> perfect,\u201d Kara murmurs into her hair, and Lena takes a ragged breath. She isn\u2019t sad \u2013 the opposite, in fact. She feels happy and <em>free</em>, like something long-caged has escaped her chest. A weight has been lifted \u2013 <em>I\u2019m not broken, I\u2019m fine, Kara likes me, I\u2019m not broken</em> \u2013 and the relief hits her hard. Last night she\u2019d been too overwhelmed to acknowledge it, but now it\u2019s clear \u2013 whatever this is, it\u2019s <em>right.</em></p>\n<p>Finally her tears subside, and Kara rubs soothing circles on her back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kara murmurs, and Lena manages a watery laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I am. Probably for the first time in my life,\u201d she sniffs, leaving the safe haven of Kara\u2019s shoulder to grab a Kleenex from her bedside table. \u201cGod, I\u2019m gross. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara chuckles, grabbing a tissue for herself and drying her shoulder off. \u201cIt\u2019s okay \u2013 you\u2019re cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>After she wipes her face Lena flops onto her back, staring up at the ceiling and trying to get used to the new world that\u2019s opened up in front of her. Kara waits quietly, watching her with fondness, and Lena feels a deep ache in her chest. She likes Kara. She wants to try\u2026whatever this is, and judging by the look on her face, Kara might too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess,\u201d Lena states plainly, starting to fidget. Her fingers rub over the palm of her opposite hand over and over as she offers what little she can to Kara. \u201cI work all the time, and I only have one friend. I\u2019ve never had a successful relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this supposed to scare me off?\u201d Kara grins, dropping kisses onto Lena\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lena deadpans, and Kara just laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just figured out I might be gay yesterday,\u201d Lena argues.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a journey, you\u2019ll need my help to navigate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve barely even touched you yet. I might be terrible at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to tutor you. Something tells me you\u2019re not terrible at anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother is the devil incarnate,\u201d Lena says, fighting off a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re nothing alike.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara bumps their foreheads together, and Lena sighs. \u201cIs there anything that could scare you off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara grins, shrugging. \u201cNope. I like you. I\u2019m pretty stubborn.\u201d She kisses Lena\u2019s nose, and finally, Lena smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Since you\u2019re so convinced - you mentioned something about tutoring?\u201d</p>\n<p>Later that night, Sam gets a gift basket delivered to her door. When she reads the note she dissolves into laughter, and Alex approaches from the hallway, looking confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Sam hands her the label. On a solitary piece of cardstock is a rainbow sticker, and six words:</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em>\u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right.\u201d</em> </strong>\n</p>"
