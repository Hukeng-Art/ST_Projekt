  "text": "<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Will wakes from a dream where he\u2019s drowning in his bed to the sound of his dogs barking.</p>\n<p>He scrubs at his eyes\u2014the dawn light is filtering through the windows, and the dogs are all clustered around his front door, still barking away. Winston, in fact, comes to the bedside and barks at Will, and he sighs and levers himself out of bed. He feels shaky and he\u2019s sweated through his shirt again. But if there\u2019s an animal out front, the dogs aren\u2019t going to quiet down until he deals with it.</p>\n<p>He opens the door to see a baby in the proverbial basket on his porch, blinks, and shuts the door again.</p>\n<p>But the dogs keep barking, so Will eases the door back open. The baby is still there. Its eyes are closed, and Will knows they won\u2019t open until he touches it. He opens the screen door, and the dogs spill out onto the porch, surrounding the basket. Will hopes it hasn\u2019t been too long since the basket floated down to the porch. He avoids touching the baby but moves the blankets aside to look at the parent nameplate. The baby could be meant for someone else. It has to be a mistake. Will is on suppressants\u2014he shouldn\u2019t be able to wish bird shit out of the sky, much less a baby.</p>\n<p>But the nameplate says <i>William Graham</i> in clear script, and Will takes a deep breath before he scrambles into the house for his phone.</p>\n<p>He dials Dr. Lecter\u2019s number right away. When the call connects, Will says, \u201cI know what kind of crazy I am, but I\u2019m not this kind of crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d Dr. Lecter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, hi, sorry,\u201d Will says. \u201cIt\u2019s me. There\u2019s a baby on my porch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did it come to be there?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe old-fashioned way,\u201d Will says tightly. \u201cI wished it out of the sky. Unless I\u2019m having one incredibly vivid hallucination, but I really don\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you wished for it?\u201d Dr. Lecter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on the nameplate, so apparently my suppressants are for shit,\u201d Will says, even though he\u2019s had the same prescription for years with no problems.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been unwell,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, tone clinical. \u201cSome illnesses can render suppressants less effective.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Will says, and rubs his forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014what am I going to do. How did I wish a baby out of the sky by myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Will frowns, and kneels down next to the basket. He pushes the blanket further out of the way, and sure enough, there\u2019s a second name.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Will says, and then swallows. \u201cI think you\u2019d better come here. As fast as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill, whoever it is, we will handle this situation,\u201d Dr. Lecter says. Will can hear the clink of keys being grabbed from the dish in Dr. Lecter\u2019s front hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d Will croaks out. \u201cWe\u2014Dr. Lecter, we\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The other end of the line is silent for a moment, and Will winces, because this really must be some kind of mistake, Dr. Lecter couldn\u2019t have wished for this with Will, of all people. There\u2019s an unsteady inhale, maybe the most vulnerable sound Will has ever heard from the implacable Dr. Lecter, and then he says, \u201cI\u2019ll be there as soon as I can. Don\u2019t touch the baby until I get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Will says, and hangs up. The dogs snuffle around the basket, and Will sits down, leaning against his screen door, and waits.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter pulls up much sooner than Will expected, which means traffic was good or he sped a lot or both. He strides quickly from the car and makes his way up to the porch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really not hallucinating, am I?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter nudges the dogs aside. He pushes the blankets out of the way with an efficient tug that speaks of long practice\u2014and, right, Dr. Lecter had worked in a hospital, and has probably seen his share of babies arriving in their baskets.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, taking in the nameplate. It\u2019s there, clear as day: William Graham, Hannibal Lecter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to be rude, but how did this happen?\u201d Will asks. \u201cLike, okay, maybe my suppressants failed, but what about yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not on any,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, his expression strangely blank. \u201cIt\u2019s never been an issue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will wants to touch this baby and wake them up so badly, but he knows they need to settle this first. \u201cWhat changed?\u201d he asks, but his brain fits it together in an instant. \u201cAbigail. You said\u2014we\u2019re her fathers now. And then we\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidently,\u201d Dr. Lecter says. His expression melts into something that might be amazement. He reaches out and traces one fingertip down the baby\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>The baby\u2019s eyes blink open, and that\u2019s it\u2014the baby is theirs, this is real, and Will has no idea what the fuck they\u2019re going to do about it.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter brings the basket inside and puts it on Will\u2019s kitchen table.</p>\n<p>\u201cGirl or boy?\u201d Will asks, carefully stroking the baby\u2019s head with his fingers.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter unwraps the baby enough to say, \u201cA girl.\u201d He looks at her intently, and then picks her up and gently places her in Will\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s mostly terrified of doing this wrong, or dropping her, or something else definitively not good, but instead their baby looks at him, and Will realizes how hard he must have been wishing for this, and knows in that moment that he\u2019d do anything for her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Will murmurs, and he feels Dr. Lecter at his shoulder, his warm solid presence a reminder that he\u2019d promised to be Will\u2019s paddle.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, and when Will looks at him, his eyes are actually damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Will says. \u201cOkay. Um\u2014we need to go to the store, we need\u2014well, <i>everything</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be hungry any moment now,\u201d Dr. Lecter agrees.</p>\n<p>Will carefully puts her back in her basket, and the enormity of the situation starts to hit him. He tries to breathe through it, but his head is really hurting, and he feels like he\u2019s sweating again and the room is starting to melt.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoctor\u2014\u201d he manages to say, and that\u2019s the last thing he remembers.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He wakes to the sound of machines beeping, and a strange sucking noise.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in a hospital bed, and in the chair next to the bed is Dr. Lecter. He has their daughter in his arms, and he\u2019s feeding her a bottle with enviable ease.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m still not hallucinating, right?\u201d Will asks, his voice rough.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter looks up. \u201cWill,\u201d he says, and he sounds so relieved. It\u2019s been a long time since Will let anyone give enough of a damn about him to do anything like sit by his sickbed.</p>\n<p>At least, he assumes it\u2019s his sickbed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had a seizure,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, and Will takes in how tired he looks. There are dark circles under his eyes that Will isn\u2019t accustomed to seeing. \u201cI called an ambulance, and you were taken to Reston. Once you were diagnosed, they transferred you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will tries to ask where here is, but his throat is so dry. Dr. Lecter puts the bottle down for a moment, and hands Will a cup of water from the overbed table. Will takes a few pulls of water through the straw, his eyes fixed on their baby, who takes the pause in feeding with less fuss than Will might have imagined. \u201cWhere are we? What\u2014what do I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have encephalitis,\u201d Dr. Lecter says. \u201cAn inflammation of the brain, and perfectly treatable, though your presentation was quite unusual. You were transferred to Johns Hopkins yesterday; it\u2019s been three days since our daughter arrived.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will tries to digest that, but ultimately decides it\u2019s a problem for later. \u201cCan I hold her?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter raises the head of Will\u2019s bed so that he\u2019s mostly sitting up, then gently places her in Will\u2019s arms. \u201cPerhaps she will finish the bottle for you,\u201d he says, and hands it to Will.</p>\n<p>It takes Will a second to get everything situated, and he\u2019s still a little afraid this is a dream after all, but the baby\u2019s mouth closes around the rubber nipple and she drinks contentedly until the bottle is nearly empty. Dr. Lecter shows him how to hold her close and rub her back until she burps and also spits up a little formula onto his hospital gown.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s so tiny and warm and Will already loves her so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Will says eventually. \u201cIt must have been really hard, taking care of her alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou worried me,\u201d Dr. Lecter says simply, and reaches for Will\u2019s free hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Will says again helplessly, clutching at both their baby and his hand.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for apologies. All you need do now is get well and come home to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nurse comes in then, but Will wishes she hadn\u2019t; he wants to stay, just like this, for a while longer yet.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They settle on naming the baby Madeleine\u2014Will suggests the name, and Dr. Lecter agrees, with the stipulation of the French spelling.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are going to misspell it constantly,\u201d Will warns him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, though he kind of makes it sound like anyone who does it will regret it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we doing about the last name?\u201d Will asks. \u201cI think it sounds good either way. Or\u2014should we hyphenate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should get married,\u201d Dr. Lecter says.</p>\n<p>Will stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m amenable to hyphenation,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor our whole family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m supposed to be the crazy one,\u201d Will says faintly.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter sits back in his chair as though they\u2019re having one of their conversations in his office. \u201cYou know as well as I the legal protections that marriage provides families in this country. You weren\u2019t conscious for this, but I can assure you that I would prefer never to repeat the navigation of your transfer from one hospital to another while you are not legally my spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will winces. \u201cThat bad, huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAtrocious,\u201d Dr. Lecter says. \u201cWhile I should like to hope the situation will never arise again, I think it exemplifies the difficulties we would face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Will begins, and then stops, and tries to marshal enough brain power to make some kind of argument. \u201cWe\u2019re not\u2014we\u2019re not even a thing.\u201d He waves vaguely between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we not?\u201d Dr. Lecter says, and tilts his head toward Madeleine, who is sleeping soundly in what Dr. Lecter assures him is an excellently-rated carrier.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Will says, because that\u2019s a good point.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve bound our lives together\u2014perhaps not the traditional way, but we are bound, nonetheless,\u201d Dr. Lecter says. \u201cThe proof of it is right here with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks at Madeleine again. She\u2019s only a week old\u2014he and Dr. Lecter are in this for another eighteen years, at least. And no one can wish a baby out of the sky by themselves, which means Dr. Lecter wanted this as much as Will did.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must know I hold you in the highest regard,\u201d Dr. Lecter says, terribly sincere. \u201cI enjoy your company very much and would count myself fortunate to be your husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Will swallows. \u201cMe too. If this is what you really want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want, for both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes in a deep breath, and lets it out slowly. \u201cThen I guess I could see my way toward calling you Dr. Graham-Lecter, except I should probably get used to calling you Hannibal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dr. Lecter\u2014<i>Hannibal</i>\u2014smiles at him. \u201cIndeed you should, dear Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When Will is discharged at the end of the week, Hannibal takes him home to his house in Baltimore. They have a lot of decisions to make on how they\u2019re going to fit their lives together, but for now, living at Hannibal\u2019s house makes sense\u2014Will needs outpatient therapy for another six weeks at least, and he can\u2019t ask Hannibal to juggle that and Madeleine from Wolf Trap, not to mention his patients.</p>\n<p>For now, he\u2019s just happy to put Madeleine down in the crib in Hannibal\u2019s bedroom. The crib is solid with clean lines, and looks like the kind of thing Will might have liked to try making himself, had he in any way prepared for this.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can convert the bedroom down the hall into a nursery,\u201d Hannibal says in a low voice as Will eases the door shut. \u201cI confess I haven\u2019t had the time yet to get started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlacker,\u201d Will accuses him, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow are you even on your feet? She eats every three hours, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cAnd I learned to sleep when I could during my residency; this degree of sleep deprivation isn\u2019t altogether unfamiliar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it can\u2019t be fun,\u201d Will says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a nap? I\u2019ll get her next bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still recovering,\u201d Hannibal says, but he looks sorely tempted.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me do what I can,\u201d Will coaxes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be up a creek if you fall over on us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal hesitates, but when Will puts a hand on his shoulder and gently pushes him in the direction of the future nursery, Hannibal goes. He stops in the doorway and says, \u201cYou ought to sleep, too, while you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll snooze on your bed for a little bit, how\u2019s that?\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep well,\u201d Hannibal says, and disappears into the room.</p>\n<p>Will lets himself back into Hannibal\u2019s bedroom and creeps quietly to the bed. The crib is near what must be Hannibal\u2019s side of the bed\u2014there\u2019s a book in what looks like Italian on the bedside table, and anyway, it only makes sense. If Hannibal was getting up every three hours, he\u2019d logically want Madeleine as close as possible. Probably Will should sleep on the other side of the bed, except that it\u2019s basically in another zip code.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t entirely trust himself to wake up when Madeleine begins to fuss, so he sets an alarm on his phone and holds on to it, so that the vibration will wake him up in two and a half hours. The pillow smells of Hannibal\u2019s aftershave\u2014subtle, layered, safe. Will watches Madeleine sleep until his eyes slide shut.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Their wedding is delayed by a few days.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to wear,\u201d Hannibal says, while poaching eggs with what Will assumes is some kind of dark magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have some suits back at my house,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said: you don\u2019t have anything to wear,\u201d Hannibal says primly, and Will rolls his eyes but lets Hannibal make an emergency appointment with his tailor.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anyone you wish to invite?\u201d Hannibal asks later as they sit together on the sofa in the study.</p>\n<p>Will finally succeeds in getting Maddie to burp, and then shrugs. \u201cNo family to invite,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks pensive. \u201cNone that could attend on such short notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could wait,\u201d Will offers. And then, even though it sounds like not his idea of a good time, he says, \u201cWe could wait, and\u2014you know, do the whole nine yards. If you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou would not,\u201d Hannibal says, and it hits Will all over again just how well Hannibal knows him. Hannibal leans over to press a kiss to Madeleine\u2019s head. \u201cFor her sake, the sooner we are married, the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods, and they sit in companionable silence for a few minutes before he asks, \u201cDo we have a cute dress she can wear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have several,\u201d Hannibal says with satisfaction. \u201cYou may help us pick.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They sleep together in Hannibal\u2019s bed, because Hannibal wants Will close in case of any complications during his recovery, and because Will successfully argued for the two AM feeding\u2014he doesn\u2019t care what Hannibal says, the man needs more than three hours of sleep at a time. Also, Will\u2019s current prednisone dosage means he isn\u2019t sleeping easily or deeply, anyway.</p>\n<p>If anyone had asked Will even two weeks ago if he expected to be brushing his teeth side by side with his psychiatrist before bed, Will would have laughed in their faces. But here he is, and Hannibal uses some kind of toothpaste that he orders online that isn\u2019t a paste at all, but more of a gel. Will googled the name and the science seems sound, and that\u2019s good enough for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I pictured you as a full pajama set kind of guy,\u201d Will says after Hannibal comes out of his closet with just pajama bottoms on.</p>\n<p>It earns him a wry smile from Hannibal. \u201cAnd two weeks ago, you would have been correct. But Madeleine\u2019s propensity for spit up persuaded me otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasier clean up, for sure,\u201d Will agrees. He himself is wearing a white t-shirt that seems impossibly soft, and a pair of boxers. One good thing about treatment is that he hasn\u2019t been sweating through his clothes every night, but he\u2019s still wary of overheating. Both had come from a drawer in Hannibal\u2019s massive closet that contained a small selection of clothes; Will thought initially they were culled from Hannibal\u2019s wardrobe, but they were all Will\u2019s size and some of them still had the tags on. It was thoughtful, in the way that Will is coming to expect from Hannibal, and also unnecessary, because Will could have happily made do with castoffs until they had a chance to run to Wolf Trap for some of his clothes.</p>\n<p>Will changes Madeleine\u2019s diaper while Hannibal goes downstairs to get a bottle ready, and settles into the chair next to her crib with her tucked against his chest. She has big blue eyes, and he wonders what she sees when she looks up at him. He wonders what other people see when they look at her\u2014his eyes, and maybe Hannibal\u2019s mouth? He\u2019s not convinced, but it doesn\u2019t really matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe wished for you, and here you are,\u201d he murmurs to her. It\u2019s exactly the kind of miracle everyone said it was, but Will had no idea how it would feel. It\u2019s something more than himself, a love that makes every other probably insane thing about this situation\u2014i.e. marrying his psychiatrist\u2014seem reasonable.</p>\n<p>She smacks her lips, and Hannibal comes in with the bottle and hands it to Will. He settles into bed and opens his book, but when Will looks up, Hannibal isn\u2019t reading. He\u2019s watching them both, his gaze steady and focused entirely on them.</p>\n<p>When she\u2019s done eating, Will carefully eases her down to sleep, and she\u2019s already mostly there. Will hopes that by the time he\u2019s settled into his side of the bed, she\u2019ll be down for the count, and he won\u2019t be too long to follow. He sighs as he lay his head down on his pillow, and prays that his nightmare-free streak will continue, because he really doesn\u2019t want to wake all of them up with his yelling.</p>\n<p>Hannibal settles down as well, and turns his head to face Will. Will thinks he\u2019ll say something, but instead, Hannibal just stares at his face, as though he\u2019s memorizing it, before he says, \u201cGood night, Will,\u201d and turns off the bedside lamp.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>In the morning, Hannibal takes Will for his outpatient plasmapheresis, which makes Will feel cold and and tired and generally not that happy, but if the alternative is brain fire, he\u2019ll deal with it. He has a suit fitting afterward, which he is also not that happy about, but they\u2019re getting married tomorrow and Hannibal\u2019s tailor is definitely doing them a solid by getting this done so quick, so Will tries not to be actively an asshole during the fitting.</p>\n<p>To be honest, he\u2019s a little preoccupied by Hannibal\u2019s staring. He understands Hannibal looking at Will while he\u2019s holding their daughter, but she\u2019s sleeping in the carrier at his side right now, and Will is standing on the raised platform in the room while the tailor does arcane things with the seat of Will\u2019s trousers. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be delivered this evening,\u201d the tailor tells Hannibal, who thanks him politely. They go home for lunch, and Will thought his appetite was non-existent, but whatever Hannibal is cooking up starts changing his mind. Will feeds Maddie in the armchair in the kitchen and watches Hannibal in his element.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you making two meals at once?\u201d Will asks eventually, because he doesn\u2019t want to backseat cook, but he has questions.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s mouth curves into a smile. \u201cThe bolognese is for dinner. It will continue to cook throughout the afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the liver for?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt gives the bolognese greater depth of flavor,\u201d Hannibal says, continuing to mince it very finely. \u201cTypically, chicken livers are used, but I have beef liver on hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt smells really good,\u201d Will says. His stomach is actually actively interested, which is a change since he was hospitalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I hope it will smell even better tonight, and perhaps tempt you into a second serving,\u201d Hannibal says, giving Will a critical once over. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight\u2014I\u2019ve no desire to see you lose any more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo your worst\u2014or your best, I suppose,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I shall. Would you like to set the table? Lunch is nearly ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will eases himself up and puts Madeleine in her little bouncer in the dining room, and finds cutlery and glasses and linen napkins. When Hannibal comes out with lunch\u2014a salad with crispy duck and asparagus\u2014Will thinks that maybe he could really get used to this.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next morning, Will gets dressed in his new suit\u2014which came with a tie, and socks, and dress shoes\u2014and presents himself for Hannibal\u2019s approval. \u201cWell?\u201d he asks. \u201cWill I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal take a quick circuit around him, then stops to fuss with his tie. \u201cMore than,\u201d he says warmly, and when Will looks him in the eye, a little shiver runs down his spine.</p>\n<p>Then he looks at his jacket sleeve against Hannibal\u2019s, and says, \u201cDid you aggressively pattern match our wedding suits?\u201d Will\u2019s navy pinstripe looks positively demure against Hannibal\u2019s frankly insane windowpane. It all kind of works together, which is both astonishing and alarming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne must think of the wedding photos,\u201d Hannibal says blandly.</p>\n<p>There are three baby dresses on the bed. Will looks at them, looks at their suits, then looks at Hannibal. \u201cYou want the yellow one, don\u2019t you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will look very nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re using our baby to accessorize,\u201d Will says, but he totally can. He does a quick diaper check on Maddie, before extracting her from her little sleeper. This one has little bear ears and Will has taken many terrible pictures of her in it already. He somehow gets her into the little tights, and then the dress. \u201cAll right, Maddie,\u201d he says softly, and picks her up.</p>\n<p>Hannibal emerges from his closet with something both lacy and plaid. Will has a moment of thinking it\u2019s a garter, and then wondering which of them Hannibal intends to wear it. It turns out to be some kind of headband for Maddie, and Hannibal looks extremely serious as he gets it on her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we good?\u201d Will asks, thinking there can\u2019t possibly be anything else. He\u2019s wrong, of course\u2014Hannibal retrieves white rose boutonnieres from the fridge in the kitchen, and then there\u2019s mysteriously a new winter overcoat for Will in the front hall closet that Will didn\u2019t see delivered the night before.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal,\u201d Will protests, as Hannibal does up the buttons of Will\u2019s new coat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re ready,\u201d Hannibal says with satisfaction.</p>\n<p>They got their marriage license two days ago, and instructions for the day of their wedding. They\u2019re not even late for their appointment, which probably speaks to Hannibal\u2019s intense time management skills. They sit in the waiting room, which is empty except for them. Tuesday mornings aren\u2019t in big demand for weddings, apparently. Something about sitting there together, Maddie in her carrier at their feet, makes Will suddenly a little nervous, a little shy.</p>\n<p>Holy shit, he\u2019s getting married.</p>\n<p>He feels like he should probably make conversation, but he\u2019s spared by the arrival of their witnesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really thought you were joking,\u201d Beverly says, her eyes wide.</p>\n<p>Beside her is a diminutive older woman, dark hair in a neat bob, and she looks both amused and slightly astonished. \u201cOh Hannibal, who would have believed it?\u201d she says, and sweeps forward, Beverly following in her wake.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill, this is Mrs. Irene Komeda, an old friend. Irene, this is Will Graham, and our daughter, Madeleine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Will says, before Beverly takes him aside.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were on medical leave,\u201d Beverly hisses to Will.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, we just also\u2014you know,\u201d Will says under his breath.</p>\n<p>Beverly gives him one very skeptical look, but then she\u2019s leaning down toward the carrier. \u201cShe\u2019s so little\u2014can I hold her?\u201d </p>\n<p>Will distantly remembers that she has a lot of nieces and nephews, so she\u2019s probably better at this than he is. \u201cGo for it,\u201d he says, and then Beverly is picking Maddie up and cooing incomprehensible things to her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here we thought you might well be the last of your line,\u201d Mrs. Komeda says teasingly to Hannibal.</p>\n<p>It prompts a snort from Beverly. \u201cYou make it sound like he\u2019s royalty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly a Count, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will stares at him. Hannibal had somehow neglected to mention that during what must have been a <i>very</i> abbreviated discussion of finances.</p>\n<p>Their names are called then, which prevents Will from asking any pointed follow up questions. Hannibal holds out his hand for Will.</p>\n<p>Will swallows once, then takes it, and they\u2019re in front of the judge. The ceremony flies by, short and sweet. The judge asks if they have rings, and Will looks at Hannibal in panic, but Hannibal reaches into his pocket and produces two gold bands. Hannibal slides one onto Will\u2019s finger, and says, \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will repeats the same a moment later, Hannibal\u2019s hand warm in his, the ring sliding into place.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the power vested in me, I pronounce you married. You may kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks at Hannibal to see what he\u2019s thinking\u2014they\u2019re getting married because of Maddie, but Mrs. Komeda and Beverly don\u2019t know that. Hannibal looks expectant, and Will figures a peck is in the spirit of the occasion. He leans forward and places a soft kiss on Hannibal\u2019s lips; he means for it to be brief, but Hannibal\u2019s arms are around him, and it feels so good to be close to someone that he lets his lips linger.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Komeda holds Maddie while Beverly takes pictures\u2014Will knows her mostly for her crime scene work, but she showed him some pictures she\u2019d taken of a trip to Budapest, and that was enough to decide him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Mrs. Komeda says, after handing Maddie to Hannibal for a few family pictures. Maddie starts to fuss a little, and Hannibal croons something to her in French, low and sweet, and Will\u2019s heart stutters for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Will says to both women.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day your friend becomes a countess,\u201d Beverly says, and the shiteating smile on her face promises that she is never, ever going to let this go.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we be off to lunch?\u201d Hannibal asks after buckling Maddie back in her carrier. He takes Will\u2019s hand in his, his finger rubbing Will\u2019s wedding ring, and they make their way out of the courthouse.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal opens the door to the house, and then leans in and sets Maddie\u2019s carrier just inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d Will starts, confused.</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks at him, then at the threshold, and holds out his arms. \u201cI believe it\u2019s traditional.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re going to throw your back out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m well-versed in lifting with my knees,\u201d Hannibal assures him.</p>\n<p>Will scowls at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I carry you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks him up and down, and then coughs delicately. \u201cYour form is aesthetically pleasing, but I fear not up to the task.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just tell me I need to work out more?\u201d Will asks incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill, darling,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cAs they say\u2014while we\u2019re young.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will gives him a dirty look, but puts his arms around Hannibal\u2019s neck, and then Hannibal sweeps him up and carries him over the threshold with no apparent difficulty. He\u2019s seen the muscle that Hannibal is hiding under those suits\u2014it\u2019s one thing to know that Hannibal is stronger than he appears, and apparently yet another thing to experience Hannibal using that strength so effortlessly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal lets Will\u2019s legs slide to the ground, arm still tight around Will\u2019s back, and for one long moment, Will looks into Hannibal\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>There are no burst veins, only a kind of pleased satisfaction that startles Will. He\u2019s not used to anyone looking at him like that, for any reason, but Hannibal married him today and he\u2019s <i>happy</i> about it.</p>\n<p>Hannibal presses a kiss to Will\u2019s forehead, his lips warm and soft, and then he lets Will go so that he can unbuckle Maddie from her carrier, and ask her very seriously in French if she needs a diaper change.</p>\n<p>Will watches Hannibal carry her up the stairs, and starts to wonder just what he\u2019s gotten himself into.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nAs far as wedding nights go, theirs is fairly sedate; they take turns in the bathroom, and Will goes downstairs to get Maddie\u2019s bottle ready. She\u2019s past ready for it when Will gets back, making fussy noises in Hannibal\u2019s arms that are basically two seconds from crying. When Hannibal sits down in the chair to feed her, Will\u2019s surprised all over again by the glint of his wedding ring on the hand holding the bottle.</p>\n<p>Hannibal folds burp cloths like he folds his dishtowels, meticulously and symmetrically, which Will finds weirdly endearing and also useless, because they go in the hamper anyway. He joins Will in bed after Maddie is settled.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to go back to work tomorrow?\u201d Will asks quietly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal sighs. \u201cMost of my patients were willing to skip a session and come at their normal appointment time. I had a few phone appointments, but I\u2019m afraid my schedule for tomorrow is all those who could not wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what I\u2019m hearing is, it\u2019s going to suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal gives him a faintly reproving look that somehow also manages to acknowledge that Will is right. \u201cI\u2019m not eager to leave you both alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou won\u2019t be missing much, just our exciting competitive napping schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s a winner,\u201d Hannibal says wryly.</p>\n<p>It makes Will huff out a laugh. \u201cParticipation trophies for all. Most improved. Best drool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would reassure me if you were the former,\u201d Hannibal says. He reaches out and puts a hand to Will\u2019s forehead, even though Will hasn\u2019t had a temperature since before he was released from the hospital. \u201cYou need plenty of rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d Will says, and snuggles down into his pillow with a small yawn.</p>\n<p>Hannibal goes to turn off the light, and then pauses. \u201cDo you have any regrets?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAside from no time to go on a killer honeymoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can go on one later, if you like,\u201d Hannibal says, looking genuinely concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Will says. \u201cI know this marriage isn\u2019t\u2014traditional. I don\u2019t expect traditional things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can have them,\u201d Hannibal says. His eyes look dark and deep in the pale light of the lamp. \u201cHowever we came to this, you should have what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will squints at him, because this sounds pretty serious. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything I need,\u201d he says. \u201cNo regrets. You?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks at him for a long moment, then turns his head in Maddie\u2019s direction. \u201cI have never imagined having this much,\u201d he says, and his voice sounds a little hoarse.</p>\n<p>Will reaches out for Hannibal\u2019s hand, and squeezes it once. He lets go when Hannibal turns off the light and settles down in bed.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s nearly asleep when he feels the brush of Hannibal\u2019s fingers against his own, and the warmth of Hannibal\u2019s hand wrapped around his.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Apparently, while Will was in the hospital, Hannibal went a little nuts on ordering baby stuff. It\u2019s all in the guest room that is destined to become a nursery, and Will looks through it carefully. He can\u2019t drive until he has the doctor\u2019s okay, and he\u2019s been warned that he might not get it until he\u2019s been seizure-free for a year. It\u2019s disheartening, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about it. In the meantime, it means that if he needs anything, he either needs to order it or get a ride to the store, and he prefers not to duplicate any of Hannibal\u2019s efforts.</p>\n<p>The baby wrap thing is an unexpected find that turns out to be awesome\u2014he watches a few videos on how to use it, and then he and Maddie are pretty much golden. He gets to have his hands free, and Maddie gets to be all snuggled up to his chest. Win-win.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t really joking about the competitive napping thing, either\u2014when he puts Maddie down for a nap, he tries to nap, too. Sometimes he just ends up reading, but he\u2019s resting, which he figures is following the spirit of Hannibal\u2019s guidelines for recovery.</p>\n<p>He misses his dogs and thought he might be lonesome without them, but an infant is constant company, and so is Hannibal, based on the frequency of his texts and calls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d Hannibal asks one day when he calls over his lunch hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cI survived for many years before you came along,\u201d Will says, from where he is definitely eating a sandwich over the sink. What Hannibal doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him. \u201cI ate the last of your fancy dill pickles, though.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou may eat anything you like,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I eat something you were going to make for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal sniffs. \u201cA cook who cannot improvise is not much of a cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not anywhere on your level, but I\u2019m more than willing to pitch in. I\u2019m good for more than baby formula, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hannibal says, and something in his tone is nearly tender, and it makes Will press his ear even closer to his phone to hear more. \u201cYou also make dog food.\u201d</p>\n<p>It surprises a laugh out of Will, and he says, \u201cJust for that, I might have dinner on the table when you get home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Hannibal says sincerely.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will recognizes that he needs out of the house\u2014it\u2019s still winter, and while he\u2019s used to roaming his fields with his dogs in all weather, he\u2019s not about to do that with an infant. Hannibal has a prosaic solution to this: they need to pick out paint for the nursery, and they also need groceries.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm more than happy to pay someone to paint the room for us,\u201d Hannibal says as they look over paint swatches. Will is idly looking over some buttery yellows, but Hannibal is clearly angling for some shade of pale green.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Will asks. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019ll be good for me to have something to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeyond caring for our daughter and yourself?\u201d Hannibal holds his eyes for a long, serious moment. \u201cThese are not small tasks, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will makes a noncommittal noise, echoed by a small sigh from Maddie where she\u2019s strapped to his chest in the wrap carrier. He likes having her there, cuddled in close and warm against him.</p>\n<p>He likes Hannibal\u2019s hand on the small of his back, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to get a sample of\u2014\u201d Will checks the name and nearly snorts\u2014 \u201cMint Condition? See how it looks on the walls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can visualize it,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI\u2019m confident it will be very soothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will kisses Maddie\u2019s little bald head. She\u2019ll hopefully have hair at some point beyond a few wisps of blonde, but not yet. \u201cCalm paint, calm baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur environment influences us,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cWhat we choose to surround ourselves with can have dramatic impact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBig talk from someone with samurai armor in his bedroom,\u201d Will says, because all of Hannibal\u2019s decor is nuts but seriously. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet you sleep well in my bed,\u201d Hannibal says, and it sounds like a casual observation, but there\u2019s an unexpected undercurrent of possessiveness.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that due to environment or the plasmapheresis?\u201d Will asks, wetting his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth, I hope,\u201d Hannibal says, and the way Hannibal stares at him should be uncomfortable, but something about the intensity of Hannibal\u2019s regard makes Will feel <i>seen</i>, and oddly safe.</p>\n<p>They acquire cans of paint, brushes, and drop cloths, before heading off to a high-end grocery store, where Hannibal makes like his namesake and conquers.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even have a list?\u201d Will asks. He shamelessly gets another sample of sausage from the nice guy handing them out in front of the meat counter.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is scrutinizing the cuts of meat on offer. \u201cI prefer to start with the best proteins, and plan meals from there.\u201d He asks the woman behind the counter a few questions regarding animal origin and diet, and then a number of wrapped packages go in their cart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a little surprised that we\u2019re not going to a fancy butcher,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal strokes a gentle finger over the top of Maddie\u2019s head. \u201cA compromise in the interest of time,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps in a few months, we can go to the farmer\u2019s market. The selection will be better then, in any case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will is not entirely sure that sounds like his idea of a good time, but he can picture walking with Hannibal among stalls, with Maddie in a stroller, the trees in bloom around them. Before Maddie, Will thought nothing would change, that his life would continue as it was, immutable. And now he\u2019s daydreaming about the future as Hannibal ruthlessly inspects produce, and that future seems like it might actually be something to look forward to.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Alana texts and asks if she can bring Winston for a visit. Will misses his dogs; he\u2019d like to see all of them, make sure everyone is okay, but he also doesn\u2019t want to put Alana to the trouble of loading them all up in her car. He\u2019s not sure all seven would even fit\u2014he actually doesn\u2019t know anything about how Alana got the dogs from Wolf Trap to her house. He wonders if she volunteered, or if Hannibal asked.</p>\n<p>He wonders how awkward this is going to be. Will was melting down when they kissed, and now he has a baby and he married Hannibal. Answer: probably pretty fucking awkward.</p>\n<p>And yet, when Alana kindly texts instead of ringing the doorbell and waking up Maddie, none of that seems to matter. He invites her in, and Winston pulls hard at his leash to get to Will. Will abandons dignity and kneels and lets Winston lick his face and pant happily.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he tells Alana seriously.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s got a look on her face, and it\u2019s a little bemused, but mostly it\u2019s curious. \u201cI\u2019ve never known Hannibal to allow an animal into his home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m mostly house-trained,\u201d Will says, straight-faced.</p>\n<p>That earns him a genuine smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything, I suppose. You\u2019ve had a lot of firsts lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will blows out a breath. \u201cYeah. I have. Do you want some coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alana looks down at Winston. \u201cAre we allowed in the kitchen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal can deal,\u201d Will says. Whether Hannibal will deal with it gracefully or throw a fit remains to be seen; Hannibal is obviously very particular, but he\u2019s dealt with spit up and dirty diapers and baby stuff everywhere without batting an eye. Surely, a dog can\u2019t be that much worse.</p>\n<p>Will figured out Hannibal\u2019s fancy coffee setup within a few days of living in his house\u2014Hannibal made some noises about limiting caffeine intake while Will is recuperating, which Will continues to disregard because he doesn\u2019t know how he would function without it. He gets Hannibal\u2019s fancy cups and saucers out, and fishes the tiny coffee spoons out of the silverware drawer, then gets the fucking fancy cream out of the fridge (unpasteurized\u2014jesus christ, Hannibal) and puts it all on a tray with the bowl of sugar cubes.</p>\n<p>Alana looks at him, wide-eyed. \u201cWho are you and what have you done with Will Graham?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks down at the tray, which is almost like one that Hannibal has put together on a number of occasions and brought up to the bedroom. It\u2019s missing something\u2014a flower, he thinks critically, and then nearly rolls his eyes at himself. \u201cHannibal might be rubbing off on me,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>The corner of her mouth quirks, but she doesn\u2019t take the opportunity to make a cheap joke. \u201cUnderstandable, in a situation like this,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to take this in the study?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d she says, and Winston follows closely at Will\u2019s side. The carpet in the study is probably a heinously expensive antique, but Hannibal\u2019s closet with all his cleaning supplies is kind of insane and can take anything a dog could throw at it.</p>\n<p>Alana takes her coffee black with a single cube of sugar stirred in, while Will takes his with the annoyingly good cream.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking better,\u201d she says, after taking her first sip. \u201cI saw you once in the hospital, but you weren\u2019t awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019d wondered; when Hannibal mentioned that she was taking care of his dogs, he thought she might visit, but nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe doctors say the treatment is going well,\u201d he offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIncluding the one you married?\u201d Her tone is even, but there\u2019s something sharp about the set of her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be sitting by if he thought it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Will says, and fidgets with his saucer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one could accuse Hannibal of sitting by while you were in the hospital. He made sure you had the best care and plenty of\u2014uninterrupted rest.\u201d She takes a careful sip of her coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe turned Jack away,\u201d Will translates after a pause. </p>\n<p>\u201cJack wanted you for a consult. I don\u2019t think he was ready for Hannibal guarding your hospital room, baby in arms.\u201d She gives him a long, considering look. \u201cYou really do look better, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just the treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s the time away from fieldwork,\u201d Will says, and sighs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m on medical leave for the next month at least, and I\u2019m taking parental leave after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d recommend that you give some thought to what it would mean to be doing fieldwork with a change in your life situation,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd talk about it with a therapist. One you\u2019re not married to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlana, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Will trails off, because he\u2019s not exactly sure how to finish the sentence. \u201cWe didn\u2019t plan for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her expression softens just a touch. \u201cThat\u2019s what Hannibal said. But people don\u2019t wish babies out of the sky by themselves, Will. He won\u2019t lose his license over this, but there will be an inquiry. At minimum, he can\u2019t continue to treat you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was never\u2014they were just conversations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now you just have a baby and a shotgun marriage,\u201d she says, gently but firmly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will opens up his mouth to protest the shotgun description\u2014nobody made Hannibal marry him, after all\u2014when his phone buzzes. He pulls it out of his pocket to see the notification that Maddie is making some noise, but when he watches the camera feed for a few seconds, she appears to quiet down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBig change from when we were kids,\u201d Alana says, looking at his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the future,\u201d Will mutters. \u201cBut we need it\u2014the soundproofing between floors here is almost too good. Someone could be screaming bloody murder in the basement and you\u2019d never hear them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been down in the basement. What\u2019s there, besides wine?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA big freezer I\u2019m going to throw fish in the second I get a chance,\u201d Will says. It\u2019s got a fair amount of things in it already\u2014he strongly suspects Hannibal has some kind of meat CSA\u2014but there\u2019s definitely room for some fish, whenever that\u2019s a thing he has time for again.</p>\n<p>Whatever Alana is about to say is cut off by the sound of the front door opening.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s on his feet immediately. \u201cHannibal?\u201d he calls. Hannibal hadn\u2019t mentioned coming home for lunch, although he\u2019s done it on a few occasions.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d Hannibal calls back, and Will flashes a quick, flat smile at Alana before he strides out into the hallway, her footsteps not far behind his.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you for lunch,\u201d Will says. Hannibal is hanging up his coat, and Will doesn\u2019t know why, exactly, but he drifts in close. Something seems off. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy one o\u2019clock cancelled,\u201d Hannibal says, and then he cups Will\u2019s cheek in one hand and kisses him, like they\u2019ve done it a million times before. It shouldn\u2019t make Will\u2019s knees go weak; it surprises a small, vulnerable noise out of him that makes Hannibal still for a millisecond, and then he kisses Will a little more, a little harder.</p>\n<p>Alana coughs.</p>\n<p>Hannibal pulls away, and he says, \u201cAh, Alana, I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is <i>bullshit</i>\u2014Alana had been hot on his heels, and her car is parked out front. Hannibal must have been expecting her and almost certainly saw her.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s phone vibrates then, and both he and Hannibal pull out their phones at the same time to see the same alert. Hannibal looks a little rueful. \u201cWill, if you get Madeleine, I\u2019ll get started on lunch. You\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t you, Alana?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to impose,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s hand is resting on Will\u2019s lower back. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says pleasantly. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to have you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will flees upstairs and spends a few relatively peaceful minutes changing Maddie\u2019s diaper before bringing her down to whatever covert war zone is currently masquerading as Hannibal\u2019s kitchen. Hannibal hands Will a bottle as soon as he comes in the kitchen, and presses a kiss to Maddie\u2019s forehead\u2014that\u2019s normal, but something about all of this strikes Will as a very territorial display. Look, Hannibal seems to be saying: look at our baby, look at my husband, look at how I take care of them both, look at how good we are together.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Winston didn\u2019t follow you upstairs,\u201d Hannibal murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe knows better than that,\u201d Will says. \u201cAnd anyway, he was probably hoping you were going to feed him more sausage.\u201d He settles into the armchair and starts to feed Maddie. He can feel Alana\u2019s eyes on them both, and when he risks a peek up, she looks a little wistful.</p>\n<p>Behind her, Hannibal wears an expression that might pass for innocent, were it not for the ferocious satisfaction in his eyes. Will is really starting to wonder what kind of fight they had over his unconscious body that Hannibal is so eager to parade his victory in front of Alana.</p>\n<p>Hannibal doesn\u2019t go so far as to ask Will what he\u2019d like for lunch\u2014evidently, that\u2019s a bridge too far in his performance of doting husband\u2014but he does make a frisee salad with crisp lardons and poached eggs, so he\u2019s at least taking some of Will\u2019s favorites into consideration. All the while, he keeps up a genial conversation with Alana, which is mostly about a journal article they read recently. Will listens with half an ear, but mostly he just watches Maddie drink her bottle. </p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s domestic magic is on full display, because lunch is ready almost as soon as Will is burping Maddie. Winston follows them into the dining room, and while Will expects him to take up his usual spot near his chair (where he does not beg for scraps, but instead waits for opportune events), Winston instead settles himself between Maddie\u2019s bouncer and the dining room door.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t escape Hannibal\u2019s notice, though he says nothing about it until lunch is nearly over. \u201cWill, do you feel up to keeping Winston?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks up from his plate in surprise. \u201cUh. Probably? But\u2014\u201d he waves a hand at the house. \u201cNot sure it\u2019s practical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no objections,\u201d Hannibal says firmly, holding Will\u2019s gaze with his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Will says, a little flabbergasted and slightly suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeyond adding more responsibility than you currently feel comfortable managing, not in the slightest,\u201d Hannibal says, and reaches out to take Will\u2019s hand in his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Alana protests. \u201cReally, Will, I can keep taking care of the dogs for as long as you need.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks at Hannibal, and then looks at Winston, who still parked right next to Maddie and looking very attentive, and it\u2019s so close to everything he\u2019s ever wanted that it makes his heart ache. \u201cCan we?\u201d he asks Hannibal quietly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal squeezes his hand. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, like it\u2019s just that easy.</p>\n<p>Alana\u2019s eyebrows are raised, but she hands Will the leash at the front door. Hannibal is carrying Maddie as they see her out. \u201cWonderful to see you as always,\u201d he says, and Will might suspect that of being a dig, but Hannibal appears to be entirely sincere.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for lunch,\u201d Alana says, and turns to Will. \u201cLet me know if you need anything, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Will says. When he shuts the door behind her, Hannibal hands Maddie off to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I do need to get back to the office for my next appointment,\u201d Hannibal says, and opens the closet to retrieve his coat. \u201cBut perhaps I should see about rearranging my schedule so that I can be home for lunch more often.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d Will says, and he means it. As Hannibal fusses with his scarf, Will says, \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t need to kiss me to prove a point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal stops, and looks at Will intently. And then he steps in close, and leans in to kiss Will, heated and tender and heartstoppingly good. \u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d he murmurs against Will\u2019s lips. And then he drops a kiss on the crown of Maddie\u2019s head, and says, \u201cTry to get some rest this afternoon. I\u2019ll be home by six.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye,\u201d Will says belatedly, and Hannibal smiles at them on his way out the door.</p>\n<p>Will stands in the foyer for a long moment, wondering what the hell just happened, before he decides that Hannibal\u2019s advice is pretty good\u2014he and Maddie both need a nap, and he can figure everything out after that.</p>\n<p>But first, he lets Winston out into the backyard to pee. It\u2019s not a huge yard, but with some modifications, it might work out okay. If they get rid of the koi pond, they\u2019d have room for a swingset.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal comes home with a really nice dog bed, which settles the question of just where he thinks Winston is going to sleep. Which is an alcove in the upstairs hallway, just opposite the master bedroom. It\u2019s currently displaying a statue of Shiva inset into the wall, because of course it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like dogs?\u201d Will asks curiously later that night, as Hannibal gives Maddie her last bottle before bed. \u201cOr did you just have some sort of episode this afternoon when you saw how cute Winston and Maddie are together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal gives him a look. \u201cI appreciate their instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cBred for purpose and singular in their devotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess that seven is a bit more than you\u2019re prepared to appreciate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think seven dogs and an infant are more than we are currently capable of fielding, yes,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cBut I confess that I like the idea of added security for you and Madeleine when I am not at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour hi-tech security system not doing it for you?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all fears are rational,\u201d Hannibal says quietly, gaze fixed on Maddie. \u201cAnd I have infinitely more to lose now than I have had in a very long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>It hits a chord in Will, a very uncomfortable one. \u201cI have a shotgun in my house,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014I don\u2019t want any guns in our home. But\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou long for the sense of safety it gave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will swallows, and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I suggest, then, Winston and another of your dogs, one suited to children and capable of defending you both.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal,\u201d Will says in disbelief. \u201cThis is one safe neighborhood. I looked up the stats\u2014nothing happens here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t suggest otherwise. I merely point out that it may help us both sleep better at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Some of the dogs get nervous around kids. I could have adopted them out before now, but.\u201d <i>I was lonely,</i> he doesn\u2019t say, but he knows Hannibal hears it all the same. \u201cCan I bargain you up to three? Two dogs to scare off the monsters in our heads, one who\u2019s just cute?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrible negotiating tactics,\u201d Hannibal tuts. \u201cYou ought to have demanded all seven and then made me give ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t give all seven the attention they need, not with Maddie,\u201d Will says. It hurts to admit it, but he knows it\u2019s true. \u201cMy life\u2014our lives\u2014they\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat they have,\u201d Hannibal says. Maddie finishes up her bottle, and Hannibal puts her down in her crib, where she\u2019s asleep not long after.</p>\n<p>When Hannibal turns out the bedside lamp, Will curls on his side, facing Hannibal and Maddie. He\u2019s tired, and he really need every last bit of sleep he can get, and yet.</p>\n<p>He shifts closer to the middle of the bed, and then closer again. Finally, Hannibal sighs and reaches out for him, and Will\u2014he just goes. It feels <i>good</i> to wrap his arms around Hannibal, and be held in turn, and they should probably talk about today\u2019s surprise kisses, but he doesn\u2019t want to right now. He just wants to lie in the comforting circle of Hannibal\u2019s arms and hold on to him with everything he has.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal murmurs in his ear. \u201cEvery knife in my kitchen is yours, should you need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d Will whispers back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will considers it, but not for long. \u201cYeah,\u201d he admits, and snuggles harder into Hannibal\u2019s side before he finally drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will honestly likes the two AM feedings. When Maddie wakes up hungry, he\u2019s up and out of bed as soon as he can manage, and scoops her out of her crib and takes her down to the kitchen. He knows Hannibal still wakes up, but he assures Will that it\u2019s only briefly. The difference in their routine tonight is that Winston follows them downstairs to the kitchen, nails clicking across the floor.</p>\n<p>Will makes up the bottle with one hand, and holds Maddie with the other. Somewhere in the first few nights, he figured out that she likes hearing his voice. So he talks to her a lot during the day, but at night, when it\u2019s just the two of them in the armchair in the kitchen, Will sings to her. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a starman waiting in the sky,\u201d he sings softly. He sings this one a lot\u2014Maddie likes Bowie, so at least she\u2019s getting some of her good taste from Will. Her eyelids droop as she drinks, and he hums the song a second time to ease her back to sleep when she\u2019s finished with her bottle and he\u2019s gotten her to burp. Winston has plonked himself right in front of them, half lying on Will\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeeping an eye on us, huh?\u201d he murmurs to Winston. When he takes Maddie back upstairs, Winston follows. He nearly follows them into the bedroom, but Will points at the dog bed, and Winston curls up obediently. He puts Maddie down in her crib, and she goes easily, her eyes closed and her sweet face lax in sleep.</p>\n<p>He climbs into bed as carefully as he can. Hannibal seems to be asleep\u2014his chest rises and falls deeply and slowly. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that when Will woke in the middle of the night, he woke alone. To have two people is an embarrassment of riches, something that even a month ago, he\u2019d told himself he could do without. And if they counted Abigail, too, as part of their family\u2014</p>\n<p>Will thinks about what he would do to keep it, and thinks about the knives in Hannibal\u2019s kitchen.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will is feeling better now that his brain isn\u2019t actively trying to melt down, but he still has some not so good days with accompanying headaches. It\u2019s nothing like before, but both Hannibal and his neurologist caution him to rest and stay hydrated and forbid him from popping aspirin like candy. Mostly, he\u2019s handling it okay.</p>\n<p>The first day he has a raging migraine and Maddie won\u2019t stop crying, though, he kind of freaks out.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is at his office, and Will knows he has a full afternoon of appointments. This isn\u2019t an emergency, Will tells himself, while Maddie sobs and he feels close to vomiting. He can handle this.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t handle this. It\u2019s not just his own well-being at stake anymore\u2014he can\u2019t roll the dice on this. He hesitates over the pediatrician\u2019s phone number, then makes an abrupt decision. He texts Hannibal <i>SOS</i> and calls him on his work phone.</p>\n<p>Hannibal picks up right away. \u201cWill?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maddie\u2019s crying probably speaks for itself, but Will musters the courage to say, \u201cCould you\u2014could you come home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Hannibal asks, and there\u2019s something immensely comforting in his calm, authoritative tone. Hannibal will know what to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy head hurts, and I don\u2019t\u2014I tried everything, but she won\u2019t stop crying,\u201d Will says desperately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Hannibal says, and hangs up.</p>\n<p>Will feels guilty and relieved all at once, but also still mostly horrible, because Maddie is still wailing in his ear and he is only barely keeping his shit together. He does end up going to the downstairs powder room to puke, which unfortunately doesn\u2019t make him feel better. Hannibal finds him in the bathroom, sitting on the floor against the wall, Maddie red-faced and hiccupping into his shoulder. </p>\n<p>Will has never felt less qualified to take care of another human being. He dreads looking up to see judgement in Hannibal\u2019s eyes\u2014he has to be having second thoughts about shacking up with Will.</p>\n<p>But Hannibal just kneels, and says quietly, \u201cDid you take her temperature?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn hour ago,\u201d Will says, still not looking Hannibal in the eye. \u201cIt was normal, but I took it under the arm, so.\u201d It is less accurate, Will knows, but not everyone in this marriage has gone to med school and is completely blas\u00e9 about taking temperatures rectally.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your own?\u201d Hannibal lays a cool hand against Will\u2019s forehead, and Will lets his eyes close.</p>\n<p>\u201cNormal. It\u2019s just a headache.\u201d He feels better with Hannibal near, and Maddie has quieted as well.</p>\n<p>Hannibal strokes careful fingertips through Will\u2019s hair. \u201cYou vomited. That\u2019s inconsistent with your previous symptoms.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot a brain-on-fire headache,\u201d Will says. \u201cJust a garden-variety maybe-a-migraine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe-a-migraine,\u201d Hannibal repeats, and huffs. \u201cYou ought to have seen a specialist years ago.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get them very often,\u201d Will says, like that\u2019s going to appease Hannibal.</p>\n<p>It does not. Hannibal sighs, and Will opens his eyes to see Hannibal\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Hannibal doesn\u2019t look judgmental, or like he regrets anything. He looks concerned, but underneath that, he looks at Will like nobody ever has, and it makes his breath catch.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes the light hurt your eyes?\u201d Hannibal asks.</p>\n<p>Will nods slightly. Hannibal covers his eyes with one hand, and Will lets himself have that moment, that care that still feels so unexpected.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you both upstairs,\u201d Hannibal says, and take his hand away. Will transfers Maddie over, and they make their way up to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just finished rinsing his mouth and brushing his teeth when Hannibal pokes his head into the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo fever,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt may be colic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods. Hannibal gives him two pills to swallow and then takes him by the hand and leads him into the darkened bedroom. He can make out Maddie, swaddled and lying quietly on her back in the crib, but Hannibal has turned off the nightlight they have so that Will doesn\u2019t trip over anything for the middle of the night feeding. With the curtains drawn, it feels like a cocoon.</p>\n<p>Hannibal urges Will to lie down, but weirdly, on Hannibal\u2019s side of the bed. There\u2019s something comforting in lying on Hannibal\u2019s pillow, something grounding in his scent. Hannibal leaves briefly and returns with a cool, damp washcloth, which he places over Will\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cRest,\u201d he murmurs, and kisses Will so softly on the lips before lifting Maddie out of her crib and sliding out the door, closing it nearly soundlessly behind him.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The world outside feels very far removed. Hannibal\u2019s house is like a fortress, insulating Will from winter and from any of Jack\u2019s demands to <i>look</i>.</p>\n<p>It makes it all the more shocking to turn on Hannibal\u2019s tablet and see the Tattle Crime page come up. It\u2019s not Will\u2019s first choice of reading material, but the top article is one written by Freddie Lounds when Dr. Abel Gideon, newly escaped from custody, had kidnapped Frederick Chilton for some non-elective surgery.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll give Freddie this\u2014for someone being forced by a psychopath to assist in removing someone\u2019s organs as a kind of gift basket to entice the Ripper out, she\u2019s got a real way of wringing every last bit of sensationalism out of the situation. The page hits have to be insane.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s been no response from the Ripper, or at least not one Freddie has written about. It\u2019s somewhat surprising; while the Ripper has gone quiet for long stretches before, Gideon has provoked responses from him in the past. He supposes this could just be more evidence of the Ripper\u2019s self-control, but something feels off about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing to say, now?\u201d Will asks quietly. \u201cNot going to point me in the right direction?\u201d</p>\n<p>It feels like a conversation cut short; he\u2019s waiting for a reply he should not desire, and yet.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThe doorbell rings, and Will thinks he really should tape a sign to the door: <i>if you wake our colicky baby up, I\u2019m going to murder you.</i> By some miracle, Madeleine stirs in her crib but doesn\u2019t wake up\u2014after being up most of the night, she\u2019s exhausted, and so is Will.</p>\n<p>Abigail is on the doorstep, looking very uncertain of her welcome.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Dr. Bloom is going to be happy about you sneaking out,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal said I could,\u201d she says defensively. \u201cHe said I could come over at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will narrows his eyes. It\u2019s entirely possible that Hannibal did say that, but if he did, he probably said it before Will and Maddie were living in his house. In any case, it\u2019s fucking cold out, and Abigail\u2019s coat can\u2019t be warm enough. \u201cWell, come in,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Abigail hangs her coat in the closet and takes off her boots. Winston comes to investigate, and Abigail offers her hand for him to sniff, then pets him gently. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asks. \u201cAnd how come Hannibal let you bring your dog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe let me bring three, because we wished for a baby and then we got hitched,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Will says. He holds up his left hand and waggles his ring finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she says, eyes wide. \u201cWhere\u2019s your baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the baby monitor app on his phone goes off. \u201cUpstairs, and ready for her bottle, I bet,\u201d he says. He jogs up the stairs, and after a second\u2019s hesitation, Abigail is hot on his heels. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow did this even happen?\u201d Abigail says as he lifts Maddie out of the crib, and does a quick diaper check.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Will says dryly, \u201cwhen two people want to make a baby and it's not happening biologically, if they wish very, very hard\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, I know where babies come from!\u201d Abigail says, horrified. She\u2019s quiet while Will changes Maddie\u2019s diaper, and then she blurts out, \u201cAren\u2019t you not supposed to bone your psychiatrist? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my psychiatrist, officially,\u201d Will says, because the state of his sex life is really none of her business, and then thinks about how that might be interpreted. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have sex with your therapist,\u201d he says firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Abigail says, rolling her eyes elaborately. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to be having sex with someone to wish for a baby, so always use protection,\u201d Will continues relentlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d she groans.</p>\n<p>Will does, but mostly because Maddie is getting really impatient to be fed, so he heads downstairs to the kitchen to make up a bottle. He\u2019s just settled into the armchair with Maddie when the dogs all pick their heads up. He decided to keep Teddy, the German Shepherd with non-traditional fur coloring who had come from a family with a lot of kids, and Zoe, whose underbite meant she would never be adopted by anyone, even though she was patient and sweet. The shelter he worked with found good homes for the rest, although Alana surprised him by asking to keep Buster, who was a good dog but all kinds of trouble. Alana said she enjoyed a challenge; Will was happy to see him to go to a good home and still have a chance to see him now and again.</p>\n<p>The back door opens, and the dogs disappear to meet Hannibal in the mudroom\u2014there\u2019s no jumping or barking, because they\u2019re very well trained, and also because <i>somebody</i> is terrible and rewards them with homemade sausage when they\u2019ve been good and waited. Hannibal pauses for a second when he enters the kitchen and sees Abigail\u2014Will doesn\u2019t think anyone else would have noticed the hesitation, but he\u2019s spent a lot of time in the past month up close and personal with Hannibal. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise, Abigail,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says, then tucks her hair behind one ear. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t call ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fortunate my domestic circumstances are much changed and that Will was home to let you in,\u201d Hannibal says, and makes his way over to the corner of the kitchen. Will, who is not above stirring shit, lifts his face for a kiss, which Hannibal gives him without hesitation before kissing Maddie\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Abigail says, and she sounds her age just then, uncertain and vulnerable, and when Hannibal opens his arms, she goes readily for a hug. Then Hannibal hands her an apron before donning his own, and they get down to the serious business of making lunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was she this morning?\u201d Hannibal asks Will.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe finally took a nap,\u201d Will says. His eyes feel like sand\u2014he was hoping to nap, too, but then Abigail showed up. \u201cHow was your ten o\u2019clock?\u201d Hannibal doesn\u2019t name names, but he does give enough detail for Will to know that Mr. Ten O\u2019Clock on Tuesdays is obnoxious.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Hannibal says, with a wry smile. \u201cAnd how was your morning, Abigail?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks surprised to be included, but she says, \u201cI had group.\u201d <i>And it sucked</i> was unspoken but clear. \u201cAnd then I met Maddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks every inch the proud papa. \u201cI would have arranged an introduction earlier, but it\u2019s been a very busy month,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe looks like Will,\u201d she says, and then she grins. \u201cEspecially when she\u2019s grumpy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d Will says, feeling an echoing smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p>They eat in the dining room, Maddie in her bouncer between Hannibal and Will. The conversation is light, and Will actually manages to eat most of his lunch before Maddie gets fussy and Will scoops her up in his arms and holds her against his shoulder, where he thinks she\u2019d prefer to be every hour of the day if possible.</p>\n<p>Abigail says suddenly, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about Maddie because you were worried about the book Freddie wants to write.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal lays down his silverware. \u201cThe safety of our family is of the utmost importance,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not Ms. Lounds\u2019 priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will hopes he\u2019s correctly picking up what Hannibal is laying down, because otherwise they\u2019re about to have their first married fight. \u201cOur family could include you, Abigail,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not entirely surprised when she bursts into tears, but he is a little taken aback when she says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. You wouldn\u2019t want me, if you knew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will goes still, and in that moment, he knows. It rends his heart, but he knows. \u201cYou were the lure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Abigail stands, as if to go, and Hannibal rises swiftly and pulls her into his arms. She\u2019s crying harder and Will\u2019s mind is moving a million miles a minute, and he can see the terrible choice Abigail had been faced with. It had been those girls or her, and he can taste the terror she\u2019d lived with; she sobs in Hannibal\u2019s arms that she\u2019s a monster, and Hannibal looks over her head at Will and says, \u201cNo, Abigail. We know what monsters are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will holds Maddie just a little bit tighter, and eventually Abigail\u2019s tears stop. Hannibal coaxes them all into what he\u2019s dubbed the sitting room, and Will sits next to Abigail on the sofa while Hannibal goes to make tea.</p>\n<p>Abigail blows her nose loudly, and Maddie blinks at the noise. \u201cCan I\u2014can I hold her?\u201d she asks, her voice nasal from crying. She bites her lip. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can hold her,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou know how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to watch all the little kids at neighborhood parties after I turned fourteen,\u201d she says, and Will shifts Maddie over into her arms. Maddie yawns, but mostly watches Abigail\u2019s face. She also gets a grip on Abigail\u2019s hair. \u201cOw,\u201d Abigail says, smiling, and gently extricates her hair from Maddie\u2019s grip.</p>\n<p>Hannibal comes back with a tea tray, and he stops in the doorway. He\u2019s staring at them, at Will and Abigail and Maddie, like he\u2019s trying to memorize this moment. Will wonders if he\u2019ll draw it, later\u2014there are a lot of sketches of Will with Maddie cuddled up to his bare chest. Will felt the back of his neck heat when he found them on Hannibal\u2019s desk, even though some of them were clearly based on famous artworks and not exactly salacious. In his opinion, Will makes a shitty Virgin Mary.</p>\n<p>Abigail ignores her tea in favor of Maddie while Hannibal calls for a car to take her back to the treatment facility. \u201cCan I come back?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cOnce you tell Ms. Lounds your deal is off.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods, then her expression turns a little wily. \u201cDo I have to ask Dr. Bloom\u2019s permission before I come over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will trades a glance with Hannibal, who says, \u201cDon\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd text me before you come over, and don\u2019t ring the doorbell,\u201d Will adds.</p>\n<p>Abigail hands Maddie over to Hannibal when the taxi arrives. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says, and gives Hannibal a sideways hug, rubbing Maddie\u2019s back gently. And then she pulls back, and she and Will look at each other awkwardly before Will steps forward and wraps her in a careful hug. He tries to imagine Maddie at her age, and it seems impossible, and yet. \u201cCome back soon,\u201d he whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d she says, and puts on her coat and lingers on the doorstep for a moment, looking back at them, before she\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Hannibal puts on his own coat. \u201cI have to get back to the office,\u201d he says apologetically.</p>\n<p>Will nods, and then says, \u201cYou know, we probably should talk about how big a family we want. At the rate we\u2019re going\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal kisses him, slow and soft. \u201cDear Will,\u201d he says, voice husky.</p>\n<p>Will licks his lips. \u201cYou really should give me a hard limit\u2014I mean, you know what my dog situation was like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next one won\u2019t be a surprise,\u201d Hannibal says, and steals another kiss on his way out the door.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a shockingly mild day, the kind that makes people break out into shorts and flip flops, even though winter is not through with them yet and they\u2019ll be back to heavy coats in a day or two. Will takes advantage of the opportunity to put Maddie in her stroller and go to a nearby park, dogs in tow. It\u2019s a nice little park, and it seems like everyone else had the same idea. Still, there\u2019s one unoccupied bench away from the others, and Will lowers himself with a sigh. It wasn\u2019t a long walk from the house, but it took more out of him than he expected. He just had treatment a day before, though, so probably he should cut himself some slack.</p>\n<p>He lets the dogs off-leash, which the park sign says he\u2019s not supposed to do, but they\u2019re well-trained, and nobody else\u2019s dogs are looking nervous. He keeps the shade of Maddie\u2019s carrier down so that she\u2019s protected from the sun, but tries to soak up every bit of it he can.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I sit here?\u201d someone asks, and Will is deciding whether to say no or just look inhospitable when he realizes it\u2019s Dr. Abel Gideon.</p>\n<p>He looks at Gideon for a moment\u2014for a man who only recently escaped custody, he doesn\u2019t look too bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t raise a fuss,\u201d Gideon says, sounding perfectly calm. \u201cI just want to\u2014pick your brain a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you picked at Dr. Chilton\u2019s kidney?\u201d Will asks. His voice comes out calm and even acerbic, but his heart is going a million miles a minute. Maddie\u2019s stroller is next to him, beside the bench. He could try to release the carrier clamps and run, but he wouldn\u2019t be fast enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Gideon says, still amiable. \u201cYou see, Mr. Graham, I\u2019ve heard from Freddie Lounds that you\u2019re the closest thing we have to a Chesapeake Ripper whisperer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do know, right, that Freddie is usually talking out of her ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so modest,\u201d Gideon says. \u201cCase closed, case closed, case closed, since you came on the scene. And then suddenly you weren\u2019t, and now the Ripper doesn\u2019t want to come out and play.\u201d He smiles at Will, as though inviting a confidence.</p>\n<p>Will rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not the Ripper, either. You really shouldn\u2019t listen to Freddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you are at all,\u201d Gideon says. \u201cBut I think you can help me find him. I think he misses you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMisses me,\u201d Will repeats, heavy with skepticism.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all want to be understood, Mr. Graham. Even him. Maybe especially him. And here you are, with your marvelous brain that has been of so much professional interest.\u201d Gideon pauses. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t mind my saying so, but you\u2019re not exactly hard on the eyes, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will levels a glare at him. \u201cAnd you think that I can somehow help you find him? If I knew who he was or where he was, you wouldn\u2019t be my first phone call, sorry to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gideon waves a hand, as if Will has apologized for the most minor of discourtesies. \u201cOf course. But I do think you can help me find him. The Ripper wasn\u2019t interested in my gift basket, but I think he would be <i>quite</i> interested in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you,\u201d Will says sharply, and whistles for his dogs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Gideon says, and then stabs Will in the stomach.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will wishes it were the first time he\u2019s called 911 while applying pressure to a wound, but it\u2019s really not. By the time the ambulance comes, he\u2019s got a crowd of people around him, which is good because one of them turns out to be a neighbor, who assures Will she\u2019ll take his dogs home. He\u2019s also got someone else helping him apply pressure, and yet another person who takes his phone and calls Hannibal and holds the phone to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm okay, Maddie\u2019s okay,\u201d Will says. \u201cI got a little stabbed at the park, they\u2019re about to put me in an ambulance.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence on the other end of the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal?\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will meet you at the hospital,\u201d he says, words clipped. \u201cPlease give the phone to one of the paramedics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d Will frowns at the phone; he\u2019s never heard Hannibal sound that pissed before. He asks the person holding the phone to give it to one of the approaching paramedics. They swarm him, and he has just enough presence of mind to tell them that the baby is his, she\u2019s coming with them, he doesn\u2019t care how they make it work. Also that his brain has recently been on fire and he\u2019s tapering down on prednisone, but he\u2019s honestly not sure how much sense he\u2019s making at that point. He hopes Hannibal told them everything they need to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Will,\u201d one of the paramedics says soothingly as they start an IV.</p>\n<p>He hears Maddie starting to cry, and he tries to stretch out an arm for her, but it\u2019s too far. \u201cShe needs\u2014let me \u2014\u201d he pleads with the paramedics.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it, everything is okay, she\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d someone else says, and the siren and Maddie\u2019s wailing mix together and Will weeps.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s much less fuss than the last time Will got stabbed. He gets a local anesthetic, and the ER doctor flushes the wound, pokes around a little, pronounces Will lucky, and gives him a neat line of stitches. Before he knows it, the nurse is asking him if he\u2019d like his family to join him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Will says quickly. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so relieved to see Maddie safely in her carrier that it takes him a moment to parse Hannibal\u2019s expression. He looks furious and relieved and also like he might\u2014cry? Will blinks, because this is a lot when he\u2019s on painkillers. \u201cHi,\u201d he says cautiously.</p>\n<p>Hannibal puts Maddie\u2019s carrier down and then seizes Will\u2019s face in his hands and kisses him. \u201cNever again,\u201d he says, and his voice trembles.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only five stitches,\u201d Will argues, unwisely.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive too many,\u201d Hannibal says, leaning his forehead against Will\u2019s. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbel Gideon happened,\u201d Will says. </p>\n<p>Hannibal goes still, and he pulls back. \u201cAbel Gideon did this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods. \u201cSaid he wanted me to help him draw out the Ripper. I need to talk to Jack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is precisely Jack Crawford who is responsible for this,\u201d Hannibal says sharply. \u201cHe exposes you to dangerous individuals, and expects you to absorb the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will doesn\u2019t have the energy to argue with him, or even the desire. But the talk of consequences makes him think of one thing. \u201cMaddie\u2014can I see her? I need to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s expression softens. \u201cShe\u2019s unharmed. Perfectly safe.\u201d He lifts the carrier up to show him Maddie sound asleep in it. It\u2019s been several hours, and they\u2019ve had a horrendous afternoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so scared,\u201d Will confesses, voice barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Madeleine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods, then says, \u201cI would have\u2014I would have done anything to keep her safe. If he even touched her, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hannibal says, and takes Will\u2019s hand in his and sits down in the chair next to the bed.</p>\n<p>They wait in silence for Will to be discharged, and it\u2019s only after Hannibal has a conversation with the doctor that sounds more like an oral final exam that the doctor is in danger of failing, that Will says, \u201cGideon said the Ripper missed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sound doubtful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks about me,\u201d Will says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he finds me that interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will checks the peephole and closes his eyes when he catches sight of red hair. He has no desire to deal with any normal visitors the morning after getting stabbed by a serial killer, and even less to deal with Freddie Lounds. She can freeze her ass off on the doorstep, for all he cares.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was at the door?\u201d Hannibal inquires when Will walks normally into the kitchen instead of stomping as he would like to do, on account of Maddie wrapped against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cA trash collector,\u201d Will says, and helps himself to coffee before stealing a piece of the fruit that Hannibal has already plated. Will has a feeling anyone else would have been swatted away, but Hannibal allows it with only a mild pursing of his lips.</p>\n<p>The doorbell rings again, which sets off the dogs barking and makes Will grind his teeth. \u201cCan\u2019t I just disconnect it?\u201d he asks, and bounces Maddie a little. She\u2019s just about as grumpy as he is this morning, which is not a great combo.</p>\n<p>Hannibal give him a look that is remarkably indulgent, before tilting his head in the direction of the hallway. \u201cWould you please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will heaves a sigh and goes to fling the door open. \u201cWhy, Will Graham-Lecter, what a surprise to find you here instead of the hospital,\u201d Freddie says, and scoots inside without waiting to be invited, which Will wasn\u2019t inclined to do, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou found the marriage certificate?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>She looks at him, all wide-eyed insincerity. \u201cThere was a wedding announcement in the paper. Very tasteful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will has no memory of this, but he\u2019s not surprised. Hannibal made him give his opinions of their wedding photos\u2014Will should have guessed he was going to do something with them, other than put one on the mantle and, rather touchingly, a smaller one of Maddie and Will in his wallet.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo baby announcement, though\u2014do I smell a scandal?\u201d She bats her eyes obnoxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dirty diaper, or maybe you,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Lounds, what a surprise,\u201d Hannibal says, preempting Freddie\u2019s rejoinder. \u201cWould you care to join us for breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will attempts to communicate via his eyebrows that the only thing he\u2019s interested in serving Freddie is a dropkick out the door, but Hannibal ignores him and ushers Freddie into the dining room. \u201cWe\u2019ll be just a moment,\u201d Hannibal assures her, and draws Will into the kitchen. </p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal, what the actual fuck,\u201d Will says in a low voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Hannibal says, nodding at Maddie. \u201cAnd I believe Ms. Lounds\u2019 visit this morning is no coincidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think Gideon tipped her off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe posted an article late last night with a degree of information that I find suspect, yes,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cShe\u2019s nothing if not opportunistic\u2014I believe she may give us what we want if we give her what she wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will stares at him suspiciously, because he\u2019s pretty sure he knows where this is going and he doesn\u2019t like it, not one bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you trust me to do what is best for our family?\u201d Hannibal asks.</p>\n<p>Will frowns at him, then sighs and nods his head curtly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen if you would bring in the coffee, darling, I won\u2019t be far behind,\u201d Hannibal says, and presses a kiss to Will\u2019s temple.</p>\n<p>Will sighs again, but obediently takes the carafe of coffee and squares his shoulders before walking into the dining room.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the brunch from hell, and Will is not precisely glad that Maddie is having such a bad morning that he has an excuse to wander from the table in an attempt to soothe her, but it\u2019s a silver lining. He\u2019d thought at first that Hannibal would frown on mealtime disruptions, but when he mentioned it, Hannibal said prosaically that it was to be expected, and that she wouldn\u2019t be an infant forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Maddie,\u201d Will murmurs, walking her into the kitchen. \u201cAre you hungry again? Is that it?\u201d He doesn\u2019t hold out much hope that it is, but maybe she\u2019s having another one of her tiny angry baby growth spurts. He makes up a bottle and sits down in the armchair, and wonder of wonders\u2014she does want it, and calms down as she drinks. He exhales in relief and only spares a second to mourn that his breakfast will be stone cold by the time he gets back to it.</p>\n<p>He can hear the low sounds of Freddie and Hannibal talking, and he lets his eyes shut for a few breaths. Everything seems relatively peaceful until he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket.</p>\n<p>For the first time since Will\u2019s seizure, Jack is calling him. \u201cHi,\u201d Will says cautiously, turning it on speaker since he doesn\u2019t have a hand free. Now that he thinks about it, Hannibal must have handled calling the BAU when he was hospitalized. The only thing Will did was follow up with HR. There were flowers, Will thinks, but he can\u2019t exactly remember.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Jack says. There\u2019s a gentleness to his tone, like Will is indeed the special china used for guests, and he\u2019s lying in pieces on the floor. \u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Will says, looking down at her. She\u2019s only sucking occasionally now, and Will thinks she\u2019s probably less hungry at this point and more interested in falling asleep while cuddled against Will. He sets the bottle aside and shifts her so he can burp her. \u201cKind of cranky, but good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I can guess who she gets that from,\u201d Jack says with good-natured humor.</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully that\u2019s all she gets. I wouldn\u2019t wish my\u2014imagination on anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack clears his throat. \u201cSpeaking of your imagination\u2014Dr. Lecter said you didn\u2019t know where Abel Gideon went after he attacked you yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Will doesn\u2019t mention the conversation happening in the dining room. \u201cHe wants attention. He wants the Ripper\u2019s attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe stabbed <i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe stabbed me very precisely. He wants a conversation with the Ripper, not his fury,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think the Ripper would be furious if Gideon had killed you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s what Gideon thinks,\u201d Will says tiredly.</p>\n<p>Jack is quiet. Then he says, \u201cWill, I know you\u2019re on medical leave\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Will says, and he\u2019s surprised how quickly it\u2019s out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHear me out,\u201d Jack says. \u201cWe have to assume Gideon will return for you if he doesn\u2019t get the response he wants from the Ripper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hoping he does?\u201d Will asks, and then smiles humorlessly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re hoping for something bigger than that. You\u2019re hoping Gideon is right\u2014you\u2019re hoping the Ripper gives a damn about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think one minor stab wound is going to push the Ripper into being sloppy? You\u2019re hanging a lot on the judgment of a man declared legally insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only lead we have,\u201d Jack says, and Will hears the desperation in his voice that he\u2019s trying to hide.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the Ripper is really offended, you\u2019re not going to catch him by having surveillance on our house. He\u2019ll take Gideon, and he\u2019ll take his time, and you\u2019ll only find what he wants you to.\u201d Will looks up and is startled to see Hannibal standing in the kitchen doorway. His expression is still, his eyes locked on Will.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Will says, unable to take his eyes off Hannibal. He hangs up over Jack\u2019s protestations. \u201cHow much of that did you overhear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Hannibal says. He walks forward at a measured pace, and reaches out a hand to gently stroke Will\u2019s cheek. \u201cHe wanted to draw you back in, and you refused.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will turns his head slightly into Hannibal\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal lets out a slight sigh, and parks a hip on the wide arm of the chair. \u201cIt is not,\u201d he agrees. He draws his fingers through Will\u2019s curls, his eyes still fixed on Will\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it occurs to Will to ask, \u201cAre you just letting Freddie cool her heels out there for the next course, or what?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I had to insist that Ms. Lounds leave our home immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will raises his eyebrows. \u201cWhat happened to let\u2019s keep our cool for more information?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really can\u2019t abide rudeness,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cEspecially toward you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend my honor like that,\u201d Will says. \u201cShe\u2019s already dragged my name through the mud\u2014there can\u2019t be much worse for her to say, at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe insinuated that you were too unstable to care for Madeleine,\u201d Hannibal says evenly enough, but the muscles in his jaw are tight. He\u2019s <i>livid</i>, Will realizes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m still unstable?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Will says finally, and knows that it\u2019s true. \u201cI feel right, with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal leans down and kisses him, and that feels right, too, and much too good to stop. When Hannibal goes to pull back, Will reels him back in by his tie. \u201cHey,\u201d Will says softly, because they\u2019re alive and together and he\u2019s so damn glad. \u201cYou want to maybe\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hannibal says without hesitation. \u201cWhatever you want, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThey ease Maddie down into her crib to continue her nap, and hold their breath when she stirs slightly. She stays asleep, though, and they quietly sneak out of the bedroom. Hannibal is rather surprisingly light on his feet.</p>\n<p>In the hallway, it abruptly feels a little awkward\u2014they\u2019ve been married over a month and kissed only a handful of times, and he\u2019d like to get back to the easy intimacy of the kitchen. The awkwardness melts away when he meets Hannibal\u2019s eyes\u2014he looks at Will like he wants to devour him whole.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s inclined to let him. He steps in and kisses Hannibal again, and then it\u2019s easy and after that, it feels like it\u2019s rapidly out of his control, and he doesn\u2019t care. Hannibal is warm against him, his arms secure around Will, and his mouth is so hungry, like he\u2019s been starving for Will all this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go slow,\u201d Hannibal murmurs in between nibbling on Will\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to whatever I want?\u201d Will wonders, but tilts his head so that Hannibal can suck a line of kisses down his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were just stabbed,\u201d Hannibal reminds him, while backing him up to the door to the blue guest bedroom. Will\u2019s only been in it once or twice\u2014it has some nice Japanese woodblock prints of the sea but also a lot of freaky butterflies pinned and mounted in glass. </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly a little,\u201d Will says, opening the door knob behind him. \u201cAlso, we have probably like ten minutes before Miss M decides to wake up and be unhappy with the world, so less talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely at least thirty,\u201d Hannibal says, but he follows Will\u2019s lead and strips off his clothes as neatly and quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to bet on that?\u201d Will asks, yanking the bedspread down and easing himself onto the mattress. He does actually know he needs to take it easy\u2014the wound is tender and it aches, but there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t have what they want if they\u2019re reasonably careful. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get as much time to look at Hannibal as he would like, but he\u2019s not mad about Hannibal on top of him, his body warm against Will\u2019s. He can feel the hard line of Hannibal\u2019s dick against his stomach, and when Hannibal gathers both of their cocks in one hand, he groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fear the lubricant is in our bedroom,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo time to get it,\u201d Will says. \u201cAnd anyway, we don\u2019t need it.\u201d He\u2019d be embarrassed about how much precome he\u2019s leaking, except it\u2019s kind of coming in handy, and also, it\u2019s not like Hannibal doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s had a substantial dry spell.</p>\n<p>Hannibal gathers up the precome and spreads it over their cocks. \u201cMessy boy,\u201d he says, voice low and appreciative.</p>\n<p>Will huffs out a laugh. \u201cWait till I blow you\u2014then you\u2019ll see messy.\u201d He pushes into Hannibal\u2019s grip, and moans, because Hannibal\u2019s cock is slick and hard against his, and it\u2019s been such a long goddamn time, and even then\u2014</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t remember the last time sex felt like this. Hannibal is looking at him like he really sees all of him, and the pleasure of being known is so keen that it almost overrides the filthy shit Hannibal is murmuring to him. Almost.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Hannibal is saying. \u201cNext time, darling boy, I\u2019m going to drink you down, then turn you over and make such a mess of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Will says breathlessly, clutching tighter at Hannibal\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Hannibal says, breathing hard. \u201cAnything, <i>Will</i>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s toes curl and he comes so hard his mind goes blissfully, beautifully blank.</p>\n<p>Hannibal isn\u2019t far behind, and he slides to Will\u2019s side as they both catch their breath. Will\u2019s brain may have shorted out, but he\u2019s still aware that Hannibal is dragging his fingers through their combined come on Will\u2019s stomach, rubbing it into Will\u2019s skin, but taking care to avoid the dressing covering his stitches. </p>\n<p>The afterglow comes to an abrupt end when Maddie splits the difference a little after the twenty-minute mark. \u201cWe meet in the middle, huh?\u201d Will says, silencing the notification on his phone.</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks thoughtful. \u201cYes, I suppose we do,\u201d he says, and then kisses Will\u2019s wedding ring before slipping out of bed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Freddie Lounds posts another article, which Will at first resolves not to read but Hannibal hands over the tablet in bed and says, \u201cIt\u2019s probably best that you see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will does, and it\u2019s Lounds\u2019 usual tasteless garbage, with added intrusive commentary on their personal lives. It\u2019s when he gets to the part where she discusses the inquiry into Hannibal\u2019s professional conduct that he really starts to clench his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill her,\u201d Will says evenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to assist, but we\u2019ll have to find a babysitter, first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s surprised by a yawn. He hands the tablet back to Hannibal before scooting down in bed. \u201cWe should probably do that anyway,\u201d he says, although he\u2019s not exactly wild about a stranger watching Maddie. \u201cWhen was the last time we were out of the house and not at the grocery store or outpatient care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I recall, you were in a public park and getting stabbed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will side-eyes him. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to let that go, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal turns out the light and settles down for sleep, and it still feels new and daring to just scoot in close to cuddle up, but Hannibal hasn\u2019t protested yet or made Will feel like he\u2019s unwanted. Just the opposite, in fact, by the way he wraps Will in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill,\u201d Hannibal whispers in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you very tired?\u201d</p>\n<p>Truthfully, Will has been tired for months before Maddie arrived, and adding her to the mix hasn\u2019t really helped. But still. \u201cDepends on whether you want to do all the work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be my genuine pleasure,\u201d Hannibal assures him, and pushes the covers out of the way before he slides down the bed.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will wakes from a disquieting dream to the sound of Maddie starting to fuss. He wouldn\u2019t call it a nightmare, exactly\u2014he dreamed that the stag man sat in the chair next to the crib, holding Maddie in its arms. His antlers grew and grew and surrounded them both, a protective barrier. The ravenstag lay stretched out on the floor like one of his dogs. In his dream, Maddie was undisturbed by any of this, and Will \u2014</p>\n<p>He felt safe.</p>\n<p>He gets out of bed and puts his feet in his slippers before snagging Maddie out of her crib. They make a quick detour to the as-yet-unfinished nursery to make use of the changing table in there before heading down to the kitchen. Winston and Teddy trail them downstairs, while Zoe sleeps on.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know what time it was, and the lights were low,\u201d he croons to her as he makes up her bottle. His voice cracks slightly on the chorus, but Maddie\u2019s not much of a music critic. He finds himself checking the windows in the kitchen, but all he can see is his and Maddie\u2019s reflections. It should be reassuring.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might have to really talk to someone,\u201d he confesses to Maddie as she starts to drink her bottle.</p>\n<p>Teddy and Winston both have their ears perked, as if they\u2019re hearing something he\u2019s not. He hopes it\u2019s just a raccoon wandering around the garbage bins again.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s glad when Maddie finishes her bottle\u2014he burps her and goes upstairs as quickly as he can safely manage. He knows it\u2019s ridiculous, but he locks the bedroom door behind him, and after he puts Maddie down, he crawls into bed and puts one arm around Hannibal tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d Hannibal says, probably only half-awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Will says. \u201cGo back to sleep. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaking,\u201d Hannibal says, and he sounds disconcertingly more alert than he did even a second ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird dream,\u201d Will says. Hannibal clutches him close, and it helps, but the fear clings closer to him still. \u201cI might need actual therapy,\u201d Will whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d Hannibal promises.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will doesn\u2019t especially like the sense that he\u2019s being managed, but Hannibal is probably right in assuming that coffee and bacon will go a long way toward making him even remotely disposed to talking about last night.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were frightened last night,\u201d Hannibal says eventually. His sharp eyes are fixed on Will. \u201cYou still are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sighs, and takes a sip of coffee to gather his thoughts. \u201cI believe what I told Jack\u2014I don\u2019t think Gideon is coming back to finish what he started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the possibility that he might lingers in your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might be different if Gideon were in custody,\u201d he says, and then shrugs. \u201cBut then again, it might not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you would like to speak to someone, of course I can research some options for your consideration,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>Will nods reluctantly. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a little sorry it can\u2019t be you, anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will listen to you whenever you wish, but as your husband, not your therapist. I can hardly be objective now,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI\u2019m glad you sought me out last night\u2014you should never hesitate, when you\u2019re in need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I came to you,\u201d Will says. \u201cWho else would I\u2014you know I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will swallows. \u201cI trust you,\u201d he says, mostly to his plate. When he risks a look up, Hannibal looks\u2014not touched, exactly, but passionate in his devotion.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, then, that our family is safe, until your head and your heart concur,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>Will reaches out for his hand, then, and lets himself be comforted.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal gives Will a short list for consideration the next day. \u201cYou needn\u2019t pick anyone from this list. But I believe they have something to offer you, and I would recommend any of them without hesitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes the list\u2014handwritten, of course, in Hannibal\u2019s beautiful script\u2014and looks up the names later. It\u2019s a diverse group, but he finds the common thread very quickly.</p>\n<p>They all specialize in dealing with trauma.</p>\n<p>Despite marrying one, he\u2019s still not fond of psychiatrists as a group, and he\u2019s really not eager to let anyone other than Hannibal start poking around in his head. But on the other hand\u2014he knows Hannibal knows this. Hannibal wouldn\u2019t have recommended anyone who wanted to paw around his psyche for fame and money.</p>\n<p>He reads up on all five, before he decides to call Dr. Nadia Amrani for an appointment.</p>\n<p>He expects to get an administrative assistant, but she answers the phone herself. \u201cDr. Amrani speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will fidgets and almost breaks out into a nervous sweat. \u201cUh. Hi. I\u2019m Will Graham\u2014Graham-Lecter. I wanted to make an appointment? If you\u2019re taking new patients. I didn\u2019t check.\u201d He makes himself stop talking, but it\u2019s a struggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased you called,\u201d she says, and her tone is warm, and that\u2019s when Will realizes that of course Hannibal vetted them all carefully and told them he might call. They schedule an appointment in short order\u2014she has a cancellation for tomorrow morning, when Hannibal has no appointments and can stay home with Maddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe sounded nice on the phone,\u201d Will says hesitantly over dinner later that night. It\u2019s more than he can say for most psychiatrists he\u2019s talked to.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I sound nice, when you met me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will raises his eyebrows. \u201cYou sounded like an asshole, and I ended up marrying you. In this case, I\u2019m reserving judgement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrudent,\u201d Hannibal says, his smile all in his eyes.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here, Will?\u201d Dr. Amrani asks.</p>\n<p>He fidgets. He wants to walk around her office, which is awash in sunlight. There\u2019s a big bay window with plants everywhere, green and vibrant. He\u2019s not convinced this will work\u2014before Hannibal, he maintained that therapy didn\u2019t work on him, and he\u2019s not sure anything has changed, exactly. Hannibal broke the curve in more ways than one.</p>\n<p>Still, though, might as well give it a go, since he\u2019s here. \u201cI got stabbed by a serial killer. I had my daughter with me, and I\u2019m having\u2014trouble. Dealing with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t look remotely fazed. Her expression is open, and kind. \u201cLet\u2019s start there,\u201d she says, and Will finds himself nodding his head.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Abigail joins them for dinner on a Saturday night. It\u2019s a dry run, Hannibal explains\u2014Abigail will take care of Maddie while they\u2019re still in the house, to make sure everyone is comfortable before Will and Hannibal leave them alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d Will says doubtfully, chopping vegetables under Hannibal\u2019s supervision. \u201cShould we really be leaving her alone with our baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s experienced in childcare, and it will give her some purpose and direction,\u201d Hannibal says calmly, touching Will\u2019s back as he moves past him with a hot pan.</p>\n<p>Will remembers girls in high school doing babysitting and nobody batting an eye. There was one town where Will watched a few kids next door after school until their mom got home from work, which was some steady money when he wasn\u2019t old enough yet to get a real job. Will made sure they had an after-school snack and then mostly just did his homework and kept an eye on them while they ran around outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay her, right?\u201d Will says. \u201cNot just give her twenty bucks for pizza?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will negotiate a fair and appropriate wage,\u201d Hannibal says, expression slightly reminiscent of a wet cat. \u201cAnd of course I will provide dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>His phone chimes with a text, and Will abandons his cutting board to go let Abigail in. She\u2019ll need a key, he thinks, and mentally notes it down to mention to Hannibal. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cHope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always hungry,\u201d Abigail says, pulling a face. \u201cThe food at the hospital is garbage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will resolves to slip her a twenty for pizza next time anyway\u2014she\u2019s a teenager, she can probably put away Hannibal\u2019s insane dinner and still have room for a few slices.</p>\n<p>Abigail gives Maddie a bottle while they finish up dinner, and Will tries not to keep too obvious an eye on them both. Abigail does just fine, and Maddie doesn\u2019t seem particularly disturbed to be fed by someone else. Hannibal pointedly sends him down to the wine cellar to fetch a particular bottle of white, and Will goes readily enough. It takes him a few minutes to find the right bottle, and he realizes he can hear Abigail\u2019s voice\u2014not clearly, but there must be a vent or something by the armchair in the kitchen that carries sound downstairs.</p>\n<p>When dinner is ready and Hannibal shoos them into the dining room, Will is well and truly hungry, and Abigail looks like she is, too. Will can\u2019t say he\u2019s ever had sweetbreads before, and wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to expect, but Hannibal pan-fried them and serves them with handmade pasta and a cream sauce with lemon and capers, and they all but melt on his tongue. \u201cThis is so good,\u201d he tells Hannibal fervently. \u201cPlease tell me there are some leftovers for lunch tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks so pleased. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he says, which is as good as yes\u2014things that Will has seconds of or particularly exclaims over tend to find their way into a glass storage container on the second drawer of the fridge with a post-it that has Will\u2019s name written in Hannibal\u2019s beautiful script.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had lamb sweetbreads once,\u201d Abigail says. The memory doesn\u2019t look like a pleasant one. \u201cThey didn\u2019t taste like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are veal,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI find soaking them in milk beforehand makes a considerable difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will cleans his plate in short order and kind of wants seconds, but he knows there\u2019s panna cotta in the fridge, and that Hannibal will make a sad face if he doesn\u2019t have room.</p>\n<p>After dinner, they settle in the study\u2014Will sits next to Hannibal on the sofa, and Hannibal holds a book in one hand and puts his arm around Will. Will reads a few articles on Hannibal\u2019s tablet\u2014he really should get his own\u2014and basks in the warmth the fireplace is putting out, as well as Hannibal\u2019s body where it\u2019s pressed against his. The dogs are in front of the fireplace, and Abigail scrolls through something on her phone while periodically poking at the mobile hanging from the top of the bouncer for Maddie\u2019s amusement.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s everything Will has ever wanted.</p>\n<p>He shuts his eyes at one point and lets his head rest on Hannibal\u2019s shoulder. He swears it will only be for a minute or two, and then Hannibal says his name and Will realizes he dozed off. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s show Abigail our nighttime routine with Madeleine,\u201d Hannibal says softly.</p>\n<p>Will yawns and stretches and leads the way upstairs, Hannibal splitting off to take the dogs out. \u201cDogs sleep here,\u201d he tells Abigail, pointing at the alcove. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to let them out before you settle in for the night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe usually give Maddie a bath, a bottle, and then read her a story before we put her to bed,\u201d Will says. He leads the way into the nursery, which is finally done. When they moved Maddie\u2019s crib in there earlier this week, he thought she\u2019d be unsettled\u2014but with the same bedtime routine, she was out like a light. He doesn\u2019t exactly want to admit that Hannibal is right about his whole sleep hygiene thing, but he can appreciate the results.</p>\n<p>Abigail is gentle and careful with Maddie during her bath, and after she\u2019s got a clean diaper and she\u2019s in her sleeper, Will shows Abigail the bottle warmer and gets them both settled in the rocking chair next to the crib.</p>\n<p>He steps out for a minute to find Hannibal walking out of the bedroom Abigail will sleep in\u2014Hannibal officially bought way too much house for one person\u2014and asks quietly, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI left her with the handheld monitor just in case,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI watched her download the app onto her phone,\u201d Will says, and smiles a little. \u201cPlus she\u2019s right next door to the nursery\u2014if Maddie wakes up, Abigail\u2019s going to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s mouth twitches but he concedes the point with a nod of his head. </p>\n<p>It still feels weird not to have Maddie in their bedroom. It feels weirder still when Hannibal talks him into turning off the baby monitor notifications on his phone. \u201cWe have to show Abigail we trust her,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Will says, and flops down in bed. \u201cStop being so reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf all goes well, you may get at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep,\u201d Hannibal says, turning off the light.</p>\n<p>Will makes an indecent noise. \u201cEight hours,\u201d he says dreamily, and snuggles into his pillow.</p>\n<p>Hannibal spoons him rather aggressively and kisses the back of his neck in a way that is probably trying to start something, but exhaustion hits Will like a rock. The nightcap Hannibal talked him into probably didn\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>\u201cRaincheck, babe?\u201d he murmurs. He might be slurring his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Hannibal says. Just before Will slides off into sleep, he thinks he hears Hannibal say, \u201cSleep very well, my darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will wakes up feeling the best he\u2019s felt in maybe six months. He stretches a little in bed, still not entirely willing to open his eyes. He can feel the sun warm on his face and Hannibal\u2019s hand in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asks, his voice husky.</p>\n<p>\u201cHalf past eight,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBest I\u2019ve had in months,\u201d Will says. He blinks open his eyes to see Hannibal looking at him from where he\u2019s sitting against the headboard, and he looks so fond, so honestly happy that Will can\u2019t help but smile at him. Hannibal is wearing his robe over his pajamas, which means he\u2019s already been downstairs. \u201cDid Maddie wake you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal shakes his head. \u201cI woke at my usual time, so I gave her the first bottle of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of a babysitter if you\u2019re still going to do the work?\u201d Will asks, tone teasing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point, dear Will, is that you promised me a raincheck, and I intend to collect. Thoroughly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will swallows. Since they started having sex, it\u2019s been mostly hurried exchanges of handjobs and a few blowjobs, but to be honest, Will is usually just too damn tired. His doctors say the fatigue will decrease as his recovery continues, but it\u2019s a little hard to tell the difference between encephalitis-fatigue and infant-fatigue at the moment.</p>\n<p>This morning, though\u2014Will is rested and feeling <i>ambitious</i>. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d he asks. It comes out pretty flirty.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to join me in the shower,\u201d Hannibal suggests, and gives Will a very heated look.</p>\n<p>Will brushes his teeth and uses the toilet while Hannibal starts the shower. It\u2019s a pretty fancy shower; Will initially rolled his eyes at the two showerheads and the jets, but after a few months, he\u2019s conceded that fancy might be good in select circumstances.</p>\n<p>What is definitely good is Hannibal already in the shower, a cloud of steam beginning to rise. He\u2019s showered with Hannibal before, but it wasn\u2019t really sexy showering\u2014it was Will sitting on the bench in the shower while Hannibal washed his hair because he was worn out from plasmapheresis.</p>\n<p>This is\u2014very different. Because Hannibal is naked and wet and staring at Will like he\u2019s going to cash that raincheck very, very hard.</p>\n<p>Will steps out of his boxers and into the shower and Hannibal\u2019s arms, and kissing him is so good. If there\u2019s one thing they\u2019ve had practice at so far, it\u2019s that\u2014Hannibal is a big proponent of kissing for the sake of kissing, and Will still isn\u2019t over the idea that he\u2019s welcome, that Hannibal wants him, apparently unreservedly so.</p>\n<p>When they break for breath, Hannibal takes his shampoo with its delicate, herbal scent, and says, \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods, because Hannibal isn\u2019t easy to read, but he plainly enjoys doing this for Will, and Will\u2014he\u2019s like one of his strays, he knows, too long without touch to be anything but greedy for it now. He tilts his head back and closes his eyes as Hannibal\u2019s fingers work through his hair, massaging his scalp, and when he\u2019s finished, Will does him the same favor. Hannibal, however, doesn\u2019t close his eyes until he\u2019s ready to rinse.</p>\n<p>Soaping each other up is a lot more handsy, and it isn\u2019t long before Hannibal helps himself to a double handful of Will\u2019s ass to press their hard cocks together, and Will is all on board with rubbing off against each other in the shower, except that Hannibal\u2019s fingers are flirting with the cleft of his ass and he asks Will again, \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a long time since college, and Will can rarely be bothered to finger himself when he\u2019s jerking off, even though he likes it. \u201cGo slow,\u201d he says, and Hannibal takes him at his word, rubbing his hole gently. He\u2019s forgotten how good it feels to have someone else do this to him, and even with Hannibal\u2019s careful, insistent touch, Will clutches at his shoulders for balance and his gasps echo off the bathroom tile. \u201cMore,\u201d he pleads.</p>\n<p>Hannibal turns off the shower instead, and they make some attempt at drying off before falling back into bed, and Hannibal snags the lube out of his nightstand before putting a pillow under Will\u2019s ass.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can turn over,\u201d Will offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI want to see your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will would much rather hide his face in the pillows, which must be clear from his expression, because Hannibal kisses him and kisses him some more. The lube is warmed up when he finally touches Will\u2019s ass, which is considerate and so Hannibal that Will sighs and relaxes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Hannibal says, rubbing Will\u2019s hole before pressing one finger in. He pulls back to look at Will\u2019s face, like he can\u2019t stand to miss any shift in Will\u2019s expression, like he\u2019s memorizing this, like he intends to draw Will with a crown of stars, exalted.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother,\u201d Will says, and Hannibal obliges, and his fingers feel long and deep and good, just brushing where Will wants them, and he takes his time working Will open, until Will is ready and aching for it.</p>\n<p>He pushes his cock into Will slowly, giving him time to adjust, and when he\u2019s bottomed out, he starts to fuck Will with slow thrusts, and Will sighs and takes it, takes everything Hannibal wants to give him. It\u2019s been a long time since he trusted someone enough for this, to be laid bare before them, fingers interlaced and eyes drinking each other in.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost unbearably intimate, and Will can\u2019t look away. Hannibal changes his angle a little, and it gets Will so good. He tries to smother the noises he\u2019s making with his hands, but Hannibal says, \u201cMake whatever noise you like, it\u2019s only for my ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will lets himself moan, then, when Hannibal presses Will\u2019s knees closer to his chest and gets that much closer, that much deeper. Hannibal\u2019s gaze is devouring, consuming, and the sunlight streaming in the room should make Will feel like there\u2019s nowhere to hide, but he\u2019s not even sure he wants to.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re only for me,\u201d Hannibal breathes, and kisses him, hard.</p>\n<p>Will pushes at his shoulder and Hannibal goes, rolling them over so that Will is astride him. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that goes both ways?\u201d Will asks, and seats himself on Hannibal\u2019s cock. He\u2019s done with gentle; he rides Hannibal hard, shifting his hips until it\u2019s perfect, until he\u2019s chasing his pleasure and the look of it on Hannibal\u2019s face. Hannibal is so perfectly in the moment that Will can\u2019t help but be, too\u2014everything is Hannibal\u2019s cock stretching him wide, the burn in Will\u2019s thighs as he lifts up so he can grind down hard, Will\u2019s soft susurration of \u201cOh god, fuck, <i>ah</i>,\u201d and Hannibal\u2019s hands gripping his hips tight.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s over nearly the second Hannibal wraps his hand around Will\u2019s cock\u2014he grinds down hard, and cries out as he comes hard all over Hannibal\u2019s stomach. He feels Hannibal\u2019s hips twitch in abortive thrusts, cock still hard inside him. \u201cCome on,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou can still\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal rolls them so Will is beneath him again, and he\u2019s done being gentle, too\u2014he thrusts into Will hard, nearly snarling, and for a split second, Will sees Hannibal wreathed in antlers, and then Hannibal shudders hard and groans as he comes, and Will feels surrounded, marked, prized.</p>\n<p>He must doze off in the afterglow; he comes back to himself when Hannibal\u2019s fingers linger around his hole. Will is lying half on top of Hannibal, and clearly no clean up has happened yet, because he\u2019s still a mess of Hannibal\u2019s come.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly a thing, Will decides. He doesn\u2019t particularly mind the dark undercurrent of possessiveness he sees in Hannibal; he\u2019s more worried about how much he likes it, how much he wants Hannibal to hold him close and never, ever let him go.</p>\n<p>His stomach chooses that moment to growl, and Hannibal twitches\u2014of the things that provoke a visible reaction from him, nothing gets him going faster than the suggestion that Will might be hungry in any way, shape, or form.</p>\n<p>But whatever he\u2019s about to say is forestalled by Will\u2019s phone ringing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d Jack says when he picks up. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cHey,\u201d Beverly says when she sees him. Only her gloves prevent her from squeezing Will\u2019s arm, he thinks. \u201cYou\u2019re looking better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will looks at Hannibal, just a half step behind. Hannibal insisted on driving him instead of letting an agent pick him up, and Will is glad, because whatever he\u2019s about to see, he\u2019s pretty sure he doesn\u2019t want to see it alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cClean living,\u201d Will says eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the baby?\u201d she asks. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can pawn me off with pictures forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m not bringing our baby to a crime scene. We got a sitter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should make Jack reimburse you for that,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>He looks at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re still on leave, so this is definitely above and beyond,\u201d she says. He\u2019s a little taken aback by how protective she sounds\u2014he\u2019s used to it from Hannibal, but it feels unexpected and even alien coming from anybody else. His new therapist is probably going to have a lot to say about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill!\u201d Jack calls.</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Will says to Beverly quietly, and trudges forward to where Jack is waiting.</p>\n<p>Jack looks tired\u2014more tired than when Will saw him last, and that was already plenty tired. \u201cWill, Dr. Lecter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Graham-Lecter, now,\u201d Hannibal corrects mildly.</p>\n<p>Jack purses his lips. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d he says, more respectfully than Will expected. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have called you if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s the Ripper,\u201d Will says, tired of all of this already. \u201cJust show me.\u201d</p>\n<p>From behind, it just looks like a man sitting on a park bench. When Will rounds the bench, however, he can see that it\u2019s Abel Gideon\u2019s corpse, and his lower torso is covered in a riot of pink blossoms with darker centers, interspersed with white flowering stalks. His hands have been removed, as have his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d put time of death in the last twelve hours,\u201d Zeller says. \u201cHis abdomen is covered in stab wounds. Looks like the flowers were planted in him post-mortem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about the flowers?\u201d Will asks Price.</p>\n<p>\u201cCalluna vulgaris and Dianthus barbatus,\u201d he says. Will waves an impatient hand, because he can google this for himself but doesn\u2019t see the point if Price has already looked it up. \u201cHeather, specifically white heather, symbolizes protection. Sweet William\u2014\u201d he pauses to take in an unsteady breath\u2014 \u201csymbolizes gallantry.\u201d</p>\n<p>His very own white knight, the Chesapeake Ripper. Will scrubs his hand over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it the Ripper?\u201d Jack demands, and Will instinctively tenses up.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me some space,\u201d he says, and Jack clears the immediate area. \u201cNot you,\u201d he says to Hannibal, who didn\u2019t look particularly inclined to step away, anyway. \u201cUnless you want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d Hannibal says solemnly.</p>\n<p>Will closes his eyes, and lets the pendulum swing. When he opens them again, he feels Hannibal at his shoulder, just behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Hannibal asks quietly, his breath across Will\u2019s ear making him shiver slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was in a hurry. He should have made such an example of him, this\u2014interloper, this <i>plagiarist</i>. That is, if this were his usual public humiliation.\u201d Will regards the corpse in front of him. \u201cSomething\u2019s changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal says nothing, and waits. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomething\u2019s changed for me,\u201d Will says meditatively, slipping further into the Ripper\u2019s mindset. \u201cI exact my vision to suit myself, my aesthetic, my timetable. But this\u2014this is a gift. I have no peers, consider no one\u2019s needs but my own, and yet I find myself moved to send this message as swiftly as possible. It\u2019s <i>vital</i> that he know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the slightest indrawn breath from Hannibal. \u201cKnow what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will tilts his head, considers. \u201cHe did not come to harm by my hand, and I will not allow the trespass on my name to go unpunished. I remove the possibility of it ever happening again. I do not want it to. This is a reassurance, a pledge of safety\u2014an acknowledgement. The recipient of my gift\u2014he <i>matters</i> to me. I need him to accept it in the spirit it was given.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has no need to look over his shoulder in fear,\u201d Will says simply. \u201cThe only one there is me. This is my design.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s arms go around him tight. \u201cWill,\u201d he says, and his voice nearly cracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a protection detail on you right now,\u201d Jack says grimly.</p>\n<p>Will almost jumps\u2014he\u2019d forgotten Jack was there. Hannibal is still holding him tight and shows no signs of letting go.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could leave the country,\u201d Hannibal says, mostly in Will\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>Will honestly hasn\u2019t considered it. \u201cTake Maddie and run?\u201d he says cautiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have yet to honeymoon,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d Jack says, and Will turns his head to frown at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a threat,\u201d Will says, gesturing vaguely at Gideon.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pardon me for thinking that the Ripper saying he\u2019s the only monster in your life isn\u2019t that reassuring, either,\u201d Jack snaps at him.</p>\n<p>Will keeps his mouth shut. \u201cWe can go if you want,\u201d he says to Hannibal, turning his head so that he can rest his temple against Hannibal\u2019s cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how safe to feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss it at home,\u201d Hannibal says. </p>\n<p>Will nods, and allows Hannibal to usher him from the crime scene, a protective hand on the small of his back.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you even apply for a passport for Maddie?\u201d Will asks. She\u2019s tiny and red-faced in the picture\u2014Hannibal must have gotten it taken while Will was still in the hospital. It seems both so long ago and also yesterday.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring your first outpatient therapy,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI had all the necessary documentation at that point, and I\u2019d hoped we might travel when you were well enough.\u201d He pauses, and gives Will a very critical look. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLess like I need a nap every five minutes,\u201d Will says. \u201cAnd if Maddie can keep the streak alive, I bet I\u2019ll feel even better.\u201d He hates to even mention it, because he\u2019s still in disbelief that she\u2019s sleeping through the night, or at least until Hannibal wakes up at five, which is close enough for government work. \u201cNot sure how optimistic we should be for an international flight.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPlenty,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will smiles, because that\u2019s Hannibal: plan for things to go well, have eight billion backups in case they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to go to Wolf Trap to get my passport,\u201d Will says. \u201cWe could pick it up on our way to Dulles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal nods. \u201cAll that remains is to choose our destination.\u201d He steps in close and pulls Will into his arms. \u201cWe can go anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cAnywhere you like, anywhere at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been out of the country for work,\u201d Will says. \u201cConferences, mostly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal makes a displeased noise. \u201cA terrible way to see a place.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably also terrible to go see a place because a serial killer has taken too much interest in you. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal nips his ear. \u201cI asked you first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will stares blankly over Hannibal\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s never idly imagined going somewhere, but he feels like there\u2019s a right answer to <i>honeymoon destination</i> and he\u2019s equally sure that he\u2019s no one\u2019s idea of an ideal travel companion. Better to pick somewhere Hannibal will like\u2014at least one of them should have a good time. \u201cParis?\u201d he ventures. Paris seems like a good bet.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a heartbeat, my dear, if I thought you meant it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sighs. The mantle is in his line of sight, and his gaze sharpens on their wedding photos. And then he thinks about Beverly\u2019s pictures of Budapest, the ones that made him think of asking her to be a witness in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think about Budapest?\u201d Will asks diffidently.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy the tickets immediately,\u201d Hannibal says, and kisses him soundly.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal dispatches him to pack for Maddie while he\u2019s on the phone with a travel agent, but promptly repacks everything the second he gets upstairs, so Will elects to get out of his way when it comes to packing for the two of them. Before he knows it, they\u2019re on the road to Wolf Trap.</p>\n<p>Pulling up in his driveway is strange; it\u2019s his house, but he hasn\u2019t been there since Maddie arrived. He unlocks the door, and the feeling of strangeness follows him\u2014no dogs to greet him, just a layer of dust and dog hair.</p>\n<p>He retrieves his passport from his desk and figures he might as well use the bathroom before they get to the airport.</p>\n<p>He stops in his tracks when he sees that his bathroom mirror has been smashed. He takes a deep breath and leaves the house as quickly as he can, locking up behind him, although what is the fucking point, <i>someone has been in his house\u2014</i></p>\n<p>\u201cWill?\u201d Hannibal asks, concerned, when he gets in the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrive, please,\u201d Will says tightly. As Hannibal pulls back out onto the road, he calls Jack. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way to the airport, but someone\u2019s been in my house in Wolf Trap. Smashed up my bathroom mirror, and who knows what else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep going to the airport, and get on your flight,\u201d Jack says. \u201cWe\u2019ll check it out. And Will?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake that honeymoon a long one,\u201d Jack says grimly, and hangs up.</p>\n<p>Will looks over his shoulder to where Maddie is safely in her carrier in the backseat, her favorite plush little lamb toy in her mouth.</p>\n<p>When Hannibal holds out his hand, Will laces their fingers together and holds on tight.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s optimism is not unfounded\u2014Maddie drinks a bottle during takeoff, Hannibal reads her a story, and she conks right the hell out.</p>\n<p>To say Will is stunned is putting it mildly. There\u2019s a bassinet that attaches to the plane wall, and she\u2019s still small enough to fit in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cChampagne?\u201d asks the flight attendant when they come by.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Will says, and flicks a glance at Hannibal, who arches his eyebrows in the mildest of goads. \u201cWhy not.\u201d</p>\n<p>They clink glasses. Will\u2019s not much for champagne, but this seems alright. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with myself,\u201d Will says, baffled. \u201cUsually I have papers to grade or files to read.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will tilts his head to look at Hannibal. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t exactly imagine myself as a stay-at-home parent,\u201d he says slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be, once you\u2019re fully recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes a thoughtful sip of his champagne. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI need to think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have time,\u201d Hannibal assures him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make any decisions right now. For now, your health is the main priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to stop falling asleep on you,\u201d Will says with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve no objections, but I prefer the cause to be having thoroughly worn you out, rather than illness.\u201d Hannibal gives Will a look over his champagne glass like he\u2019d like to be <i>wearing Will out</i> right this second.</p>\n<p>Will has honestly never had any interest in joining the mile high club, and he still doesn\u2019t, but there\u2019s no reason in the world that he shouldn\u2019t kiss Hannibal right then, the taste of champagne bright on his tongue. \u201cBehave yourself,\u201d Will whispers, \u201cand maybe I\u2019ll let you put your hands under the blanket later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow scandalous,\u201d Hannibal purrs, and kisses Will once more.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Maddie is less confused about what time it is than Will is, but she\u2019s not any happier about it. They have a layover in Munich, and then a short flight to Budapest, where she fusses in Hannibal\u2019s arms for the duration of the flight. When they finally disembark and collect their luggage, even Hannibal looks a little travel-worn. It\u2019s evening, and the sun has set by the time their taxi drops them off in the heart of the city.</p>\n<p>Hannibal booked a long-term apartment instead of a hotel room, and Will sees why when they open the door\u2014it comes complete with a full kitchen.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s the view of the Danube from the living room window that stops him in his tracks. The water reflects the lights from the bridges that span it, and when he opens the window, the cool wind carries the scent of river water, one that Will knows to his bones.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it meet with your satisfaction?\u201d Hannibal asks, coming up behind him and settling his hands on Will\u2019s hips.</p>\n<p>Will breathes in deep, and feels something in himself go still and pliant. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal kisses his neck. \u201cImagine how you\u2019ll feel when you have dinner in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all I want in me,\u201d Will says, which is actually more aspirational than likely at the moment, but what the hell, it is their honeymoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can\u2014fit in our busy schedule when I return with dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will groans, but can\u2019t stop himself from smiling. \u201cThat was terrible. Get out, go get food.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal gooses him once, and heads back out into the cool night.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The jet lag is real, but so is the espresso at the cafe around the corner. Hannibal has Maddie in her wrap carrier, and she\u2019s babbling and smiling and patting his sweater and his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo solids for you yet, darling,\u201d Hannibal says, as she grabs a flake of croissant that made its way onto Hannibal\u2019s sweater.</p>\n<p>Will wrests it out of her tiny fist before she can put it in her mouth, and gives her her lamb toy instead. Her expression is so intensely Hannibal\u2019s \u201cnot-amused\u201d look that Will bursts out into laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hannibal asks, looking curious.</p>\n<p>\u201cHer face,\u201d Will says, still smiling. \u201cShe made a face just like you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Hannibal says, but despite his haughty tone, his eyes are crinkled with amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat should we do today?\u201d Will asks. Hannibal bought return tickets a month from now, which seems ludicrous and like he won\u2019t have a practice to return to if he keeps this up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever we like,\u201d he says simply. \u201cThough I would like to purchase groceries, so perhaps we should start there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrugstore, too,\u201d Will says, because they packed diapers, but not enough for a month.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we explore?\u201d Hannibal asks Maddie. She gurgles in reply, and Hannibal smiles at her so sweetly that it makes Will\u2019s breath catch.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When the apartment is stocked, Will and Maddie have a nap\u2014Maddie in her popup travel crib in one bedroom, and Will in the master bedroom. He nearly falls asleep on Hannibal in the living area, but Hannibal shoos him off to sleep in a real bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be trying to stay awake to reset my internal clock?\u201d Will mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re recovering from a serious illness,\u201d Hannibal reminds him placidly. He\u2019s sketching the view of the river and the Buda side of the city from their window. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me sleep forever,\u201d Will says grumpily, and that more than anything suggests that a nap is definitely in order.</p>\n<p>Hannibal, of course, does not wake him up. Will surfaces from sleep to the smell of dinner cooking. When he stumbles blearily out into the great room, he\u2019s all ready to be annoyed and maybe pick a little fight, but Hannibal has Maddie on his lap and is giving her a bottle, and he looks so peaceful and content that all the fight drains out of Will in an instant. He shuffles over to the sofa and sits next to Hannibal, leaning against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d Hannibal asks quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Will admits. \u201cI might have needed that. Thought you had plans for this afternoon, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal turns his head to press a soft kiss to Will\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re in no hurry. The Basilica will still be there tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this what you imagined?\u201d Will asks. \u201cFor our honeymoon, I mean.\u201d He feels a little bad\u2014Hannibal is doing a lot of caretaking. Will is exhausted just trying to keep up with Maddie; he doesn\u2019t know how Hannibal is handling the both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagined taking you to Florence,\u201d Hannibal says, tone meditative. \u201cI spent time there as a young man. I think you would like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will frowns. \u201cYou should have said. We could have gone there instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go at some point. Perhaps when Madeleine is older and better able to appreciate all the city has to offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will imagines Maddie at six or seven years old, imagines Hannibal with a little more silver in his hair. He imagines her holding their hands, dwarfed by sprawling Renaissance canvases.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want for her?\u201d Will asks. They didn\u2019t exactly get a chance to compare parenting philosophies before Maddie arrived on his doorstep.</p>\n<p>\u201cFreedom,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cFreedom to discover, to appreciate beauty where she finds it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will can\u2019t help himself. \u201cWhat if she finds beauty in, I don\u2019t know, soccer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of Hannibal\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cA healthy body, a healthy mind,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would like for her to have music lessons, regardless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to start her on harpsichord young?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she likes,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cIt is our responsibility and privilege as parents to guide her.\u201d Maddie finishes her bottle, and Hannibal shifts her to his shoulder to burp her. \u201cWhat kind of father will you be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA good one,\u201d Will says, and he wants it so much that his throat goes tight. \u201cI want to be the best I can be for her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cOf that, I have no doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will lets his head rest on Hannibal\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal is quiet for a moment, his hand rubbing Maddie\u2019s back gently. \u201cI never imagined having children,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed neither desirable nor prudent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t on suppressants,\u201d Will says, remembering that phone call on his porch, a seeming lifetime ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one can wish a child from the sky alone,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI had no need of suppressants, or so I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then Abigail happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou happened,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will picks his head off his shoulder to look him in the eye. \u201cAnd I did not understand the degree to which I desired you with me, never to be parted, entwined at the most elemental level.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s mouth parts in astonishment. He doesn\u2019t know what to say to that, because it makes it sound as though Hannibal has\u2014that all along, he\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d Will asks, full of hope and fear and a yearning so fierce he can hardly stand it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Hannibal says, so terribly gently. \u201cDear Will, can\u2019t you see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says, his voice trembling, because he can see it, the shape recognizable but overwhelming and all-encompassing, grand and terrifying on a scale he can barely imagine. And he knows, then, what no evidence could prove but feels truer than anything. \u201cYou\u2019re the love of my life,\u201d he says, and he doesn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at the realization.</p>\n<p>Hannibal chooses tears, welling in his eyes but not spilling over until he kisses Will desperately, as if he\u2019ll never have another chance.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They stay close through dinner, both of them feeling a little emotionally frayed and not eager to leave each other\u2019s sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a little more well done than I intended,\u201d Hannibal says ruefully after he rescues dinner from the oven.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou know I\u2019d be eating bologna sandwiches without you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks pained. \u201cPlease, do not remind me. Perhaps we should also have a discussion about pediatric nutrition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will holds up his hands in surrender. \u201cYou want to feed her so she grows up strong and healthy. I\u2019m on board with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want her never to go hungry,\u201d Hannibal says, and there\u2019s a depth of emotion there that strikes too resonant a chord with Will, and he settles for nodding in sharp agreement.</p>\n<p>They go for a walk after dinner through a park on the Danube. The nearby Chain Bridge glitters with lights; the boats sailing down the river cast a halo of light on the dark water around them. It\u2019s chilly, but Will is wrapped up in a warm jacket, and Maddie is in her little bear sleeper. Hannibal pushes the stroller at a sedate pace that Will can handle, and when he stops and takes Will\u2019s hand in his, his thumb stroking Will\u2019s wedding ring, Will thinks he can\u2019t imagine being happier than this.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They make repeated trips to the National Gallery in Buda Castle, once Will is up to walking across the bridge. They take the funicular up, because he can walk up to the castle or through it, but he can\u2019t do both. There\u2019s some truly appalling medieval art\u2014Hannibal sits down in front of one to sketch, and when it becomes clear that Will is going to end up in the Virgin Mary\u2019s place again, Will says, \u201cOur baby is way cuter than that Jesus, who is probably going to give me nightmares. Take a lot of artistic license, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sometimes stays with Hannibal while he sketches, and sometimes walks around with Maddie. He spends some time just looking at a large painting called <i>Women of Eger</i>. The battlements smoke and snarl in the brushstrokes; he can\u2019t take his eyes off the woman brandishing a sword against the fortress\u2019s attackers. He\u2019d overheard a tour guide talking about this painting\u2014it was painted almost three centuries after the siege is depicts and it\u2019s unlikely to be a historically accurate presentation, but when he looks at that woman with the sword, he thinks:</p>\n<p>She slew her enemies for hearth and home, and lived.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They take leisurely boat rides up and down the Danube. Will loves the cool wind on his face, the sound of the rushing water, the bridges that arc overhead. He thinks about what he\u2019d like to teach Maddie when she\u2019s old enough\u2014he wonders if she\u2019ll have any interest in the intricacies of fly-tying, if someday he\u2019ll hold her on his lap and let her look through the magnifying glass as he winds thread and feathers and bone.</p>\n<p>He thinks about how clear-headed he feels now, how right it feels to have Maddie in his arms and Hannibal at his side. Garrett Jacob Hobbs no longer haunts him. He\u2019s not nightmare free, but he never was.</p>\n<p>He feels like he could be whole.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t go back?\u201d he says to Hannibal, almost too quietly to be heard over the wind and the breaking of the water.</p>\n<p>Hannibal curls an arm around his waist, and leans his head against Will\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019d sell the houses, send for your dogs, and find an agreeable location to raise Madeleine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Will says, wonderingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>What would it be like to always feel this safe, to no longer bed down with killers?</p>\n<p>He asks Dr. Amrani that in their next Skype appointment. She looks thoughtful.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would it be like?\u201d she asks him.</p>\n<p>He stares out at the Danube, over the tablet screen. \u201cGood,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI think it would be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s say you return to Baltimore, and everything is the way it was before you left. Would you still feel the way you do now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sighs and rubs one temple. \u201cNot without some serious changes,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat might those look like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Four months ago, he wasn\u2019t prepared to think about that question seriously. Now, he lets the possibilities unspool between them, and it feels reckless and frightening to let them even pass his lips, but also:</p>\n<p>He feels light, relieved, <i>hopeful</i>.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>By the end of their month in Budapest, Maddie has progressed to doing a little baby push up when they put her on the floor for tummy time.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be mobile before we know it,\u201d Will says, from where he is also on his stomach on the floor, making the lamb toy dance for Maddie\u2019s amusement.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s expression is one of open adoration. \u201cShe\u2019s very advanced,\u201d he says, like he\u2019s going to burst with fatherly pride.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much baby-proofing to do when we get home,\u201d Will warns him.</p>\n<p>Hannibal doesn\u2019t look up from washing the breakfast dishes. \u201cThen you do wish to return to Baltimore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Will says. \u201cAt least, for now.\u201d He lets Maddie capture the lamb and put it in her mouth. He thinks it\u2019s mostly baby drool by weight, at this point. He takes in a deep breath and lets it out slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about the BAU.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can practically hear Hannibal biting his tongue. Eventually, Hannibal says, \u201cYou need not do what you have always done,\u201d which is pretty fucking restrained for him; Will knows Hannibal wants him nowhere near Quantico. It would have been a fight a month ago, but Will has had some time to think, and several Skype appointments with Dr. Amrani on the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cGWU has asked me a few times about teaching some classes,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cI always said no because it would have been a headache to juggle that and the Academy.\u201d He eases himself up off the floor to join Hannibal at the kitchen sink. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been thinking a little bit about getting my doctorate. They have a new program, mostly online. We\u2019d still need some daycare for Maddie, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019d be raking in cash on an adjunct\u2019s salary\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal seizes him in his arms, wet hands clutching Will close. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cIf you never brought a penny into our household, it would be fine. I want you to be happy\u2014let me help you do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Please</i>,\u201d Hannibal says, mostly into Will\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Will lets his eyes close, and he holds Hannibal just as tightly as he\u2019s being held. \u201cI haven\u2019t even applied yet, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal makes a dismissive noise, like no admissions committee would dare stand in Will\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure yet. But I wanted you to know what I was thinking about.\u201d Will pulls back to look him in the eye. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just me anymore. We\u2019re in this together, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal holds his gaze for a long moment. \u201cAlways, dear Will.\u201d<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nBaltimore in May is lovely. It would be lovelier if there weren\u2019t an agent in an unmarked car outside their house, but Jack apparently doesn\u2019t feel the same way. Will appreciated the protection detail for the house while Abigail was dogsitting; he appreciates it less now that they\u2019re home.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about my house in Wolf Trap?\u201d he asks Jack.</p>\n<p>Jack shakes his head. His eyes keep wandering to Maddie, who is on her tummy on a blanket on the floor, with Winston and Teddy lying just on the edges of the blanket and looking very attentive. \u201cWe had a team go over it, but nothing came up aside from the vandalism.\u201d</p>\n<p>Breaking all the mirrors is a specific kind of vandalism, but by itself, it\u2019s not much to go on. Still, there\u2019s something there in Jack\u2019s expression that makes Will pause. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack sighs, and he sounds bone-tired. He rubs one hand over his face. \u201cWill,\u201d he says, and then stops. He\u2019s looking at Maddie again, and there\u2019s such an aching regret in his eyes that it makes Will\u2019s throat tight, but Will knows what Jack will do. What he will always do.</p>\n<p>Will decides to make it easy on him. \u201cLeave the case files with me, and I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s a case?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe better question is, what\u2019s making you worry about the connection between it and the break-in at my house?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jack pulls several files out of his briefcase. \u201cHannibal doesn\u2019t know I gave you these.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe will, because I\u2019m going to ask him his opinion. It\u2019s your lucky day: two consultants for the price of one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your marriage,\u201d Jack says, holding up his hands in surrender.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Will says, just a hint of warning in his voice. \u201cWill you stay for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can give Maddie her bottle while I get the meat marinating,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>Jack acquiesces with a nod, and there\u2019s a softness to his eyes when he looks at Maddie that Will has rarely seen before. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPork loin something or other,\u201d Will says. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just follow the recipe card he leaves out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Will doesn\u2019t bring out the case file until Jack is gone and Maddie has been put to bed. He and Hannibal are sitting on the sofa in the study, and the dogs are sitting in front of the small fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I\u2019d look at it,\u201d Will says. He takes a sip of the brandy Hannibal poured for them. \u201cI\u2019d rather look at it with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not opposed. Provided, of course, that you feel comfortable reviewing the case at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will actually texted Dr. Amrani, who gave him the go-ahead, with the understanding that they\u2019d talk about it in their next session. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he says. He opens the file and starts to read. He hands each page to Hannibal when he\u2019s done reading. He doesn\u2019t like to make notes when he first starts\u2014he likes to take it all in, let it settle, and then start again from the beginning. Hannibal makes notes while he reads, all in the beautiful script he writes in as easily as breathing.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019ve been at it for nearly an hour, Will says, \u201cJack\u2019s worried that the same person who broke into my house killed these two couples.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will lets his eyes close, and tilts his head to rest on the back of the couch. \u201cBoth sets of murders were committed by the same person. Mirrors broken in all three locations\u2014that could be a coincidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it is,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Will says. \u201cI don\u2019t. But these murders\u2014they\u2019re not what our killer is after. These are warmups. He\u2019s after something else, something he hasn\u2019t gotten yet.\u201d He turns the file pages again in his memory, looks at the pictures of the shattered mirrors.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Hannibal asks. The fascination in his voice sends a shiver down Will\u2019s spine. He\u2019s not fascinated by the killer\u2014or at least, only marginally. He\u2019s fascinated by <i>Will</i>, like he\u2019d just as soon pin him and mount him for display, and that should not be turning Will on, but he knows how Hannibal would look at him, knows his eyes would be full of the passionate fervor of his regard, and Will\u2014</p>\n<p>He\u2019s fascinated right back.</p>\n<p>He opens his eyes to see that Hannibal is indeed staring at him with interest. \u201cLet\u2019s leave this for tomorrow,\u201d Will says. He licks his lips. \u201cWould it be weird if we\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like watching your mind work,\u201d Hannibal says, sliding one hand up Will\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cPervert,\u201d Will accuses with a huff of laughter.</p>\n<p>Parenthood has taught them both to seize their moments when they find them, so in relatively short order, they\u2019re naked in bed, Will on his knees and holding the headboard. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s deep,\u201d he groans out. They don\u2019t fuck in this position very often, because Hannibal has a whole thing about looking at Will\u2019s face, and Will has a whole thing about letting him look all he wants. Right now, though, Will thinks Hannibal can live without staring deep into his eyes\u2014well, until Will comes, anyway, which could be alarmingly soon. \u201cOh god,\u201d he says. \u201cFuck, I need\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal braces his hands down beside Will\u2019s shoulders, their skin hot and slick where it touches. He feels surrounded by Hannibal, hollowed out by him, so that he\u2019s filled up by the sound of Hannibal\u2019s breathing in his ear, the sting of Hannibal\u2019s teeth against his neck, the feel of his cock spreading him wide and getting him so fucking good. Will braces himself on the headboard and pushes back to meet him, and Hannibal <i>growls</i> and fucks him even harder. </p>\n<p>Will feels half out of his mind, and when he turns his head back to try and catch Hannibal\u2019s lips, he wonders suddenly if this is what the Ripper wants\u2014does he want Will like this? Does he want Will spread out beneath him? Does he want\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re on suppressants?\u201d Hannibal asks suddenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou watched me take them this morning,\u201d Will says, a little bewildered.</p>\n<p>Hannibal slows his pace, grinding in. \u201cIf I could,\u201d he says, nipping at Will\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019d put a baby in you.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is exactly the kind of talk that gets people in trouble, or so Will assumes. Too bad his hindbrain doesn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cWell, come on, daddy,\u201d Will says. \u201cPut your back into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal does, and <i>how</i>.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re lazing around in the afterglow\u2014well, Will is lazing, Hannibal is very industriously fingering come back into Will\u2019s ass\u2014Will says, \u201cThat was just heat of the moment, right? I was kind of thinking we\u2019d wait until Maddie was two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSensible,\u201d Hannibal allows.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>They\u2019re at their second farmer\u2019s market of the morning, and while it would be a stretch to say that Will doesn\u2019t mind, he hadn\u2019t quite realized how convenient it would be to have a baby to draw all the attention away from him. Turns out, he can answer the same five questions from strangers about Maddie, and no one asks him anything about himself, or thinks it\u2019s weird that he looks at Maddie instead of looking at them. Strangers and little kids ask if they can pet the dogs, which Will readily agrees to; all other questions are fielded by Hannibal, who fills up canvas bags with their purchases and places them in the bottom of the stroller.</p>\n<p>Will, Maddie, and the dogs wait outside Hannibal\u2019s preferred butcher shop, and Will watches Hannibal have an animated conversation with the woman at the counter. Her hair is buzzed short, and her arms are well-muscled. Even if the card in the window didn\u2019t proclaim the store to be woman-owned, Will would have guessed that she was the butcher. In short order, Hannibal has a number of paper-wrapped packages that go in the cooler bag. She follows him out, and holds out a bag to Will. \u201cSomething for your dogs,\u201d she says, with a brisk warmth that Will thinks is aimed mostly at his dogs, but a little bit at him, too. Hannibal is clearly a favorite customer.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. He peeks in the bag to see several large bones. He can give them to Winston and Teddy; Zoe\u2019s too small and her jaw is the wrong shape, but he\u2019ll give her another treat she can eat safely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you next week,\u201d Hannibal says, and they do; Saturday morning grocery shopping turns into a routine, and if it takes longer than Will hitting up the local supermarket, it\u2019s pleasant to spend time outside, and Hannibal always enjoys himself.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the meat goes in the basement freezer\u2014Will accuses Hannibal of being a meat hoarder, but Hannibal just says that some cuts are too good to pass up.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Will asks for the fifth time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe we can do without you for one morning,\u201d Hannibal says with patient amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just seems kind of not right, to go do something I want to do and leave you at home with Maddie,\u201d Will says, wincing. \u201cI mean\u2014it\u2019s not like either of us have had much free time. There\u2019s got to be something you want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs it happens, yes,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cThere\u2019s a production of <i>Norma</i> next weekend; I would be very pleased if you would accompany me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI walked right into that,\u201d Will says ruefully, but he agrees to it, because it really isn\u2019t fair for him to go fishing and not give Hannibal the chance for a night out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDate night is important,\u201d Beverly tells him when she picks him up for their fishing adventure. She\u2019s never been fishing, but when Will asked her if she wanted to go, she accepted immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cDate night?\u201d Will says. He hadn\u2019t exactly thought of it that way.</p>\n<p>\u201cCountess Will is going to be in the society pages,\u201d she sing-songs to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d he begs. She does, but only because she get a nibble on her line.</p>\n<p>Hannibal certainly does not stop\u2014he presents Will with a custom tuxedo, a pair of cufflinks, and new shoes. Will submits to all of it up until Hannibal is about to put product in Will\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do my own hair,\u201d he grouses, and Hannibal looks almost hurt. And Will sighs, because Hannibal is clearly having such a good time getting Will gussied up, and, well\u2014it is date night.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to shave, too?\u201d he asks, only half-sarcastically. He ties the towel around his waist a little more securely.</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks like he\u2019s torn between an emphatic yes, and bending Will over the bathroom counter and missing the opera altogether.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo get our outfits ready and let me shave in peace,\u201d Will says. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019re never getting out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They nearly don\u2019t get out of there anyway, but that\u2019s because Hannibal hands Will a scrap of lace that aspires to be underwear, and then sucks him off in his enormous walk-in closet when the sight of it barely containing Will is too much for the both of them.</p>\n<p>On their way out the door, Will and Hannibal both kiss Maddie goodbye. \u201cBe good for Abigail,\u201d Hannibal tells her. To Abigail, he says, \u201cYour dinner is in the fridge\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me already,\u201d she says, with good-natured exasperation. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second Hannibal\u2019s back is turned, Will hands her two twenties and mouths <i>pizza</i> and then follows him out to the car.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal is having the time of his <i>life</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHannibal, darling,\u201d Mrs. Komeda says, swooping in and neatly displacing whatever goddamn lawyer was trying to one up Hannibal on his knowledge of how difficult the role of the titular Norma is and whether the soprano cast in the role is up to it. Hannibal clearly thinks that she is, and that the lawyer is a moron.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Komeda and Hannibal trade air kisses, and then she does the same to Will. He does not air kiss back, but hopes that maintaining his ground with minimal flinching will do well enough. </p>\n<p>Evidently, it does. \u201cHow lovely to see you two again,\u201d Mrs. Komeda says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking a little more rested then you were at your wedding.\u201d It\u2019s pitched just loud enough that the people around them can hear, and Will can practically see that start to disseminate throughout the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had a lovely honeymoon in Budapest,\u201d Hannibal says. He keeps Will\u2019s hand tucked in the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have guessed Paris or Milan, but trust you to choose somewhere a little more unusual,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks at Will with an expression so adoring that Will\u2019s sure it can be seen from space. \u201cIt was Will\u2019s choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy, you have hidden depths, Will. And how is darling Madeleine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will surprises all three of them by saying, \u201cGood.\u201d And then, slightly awkwardly, \u201cWould you like to see a picture?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d she says warmly.</p>\n<p>Will takes his phone out of his pocket and shows her a picture of all three of them on their second to last day in Budapest\u2014Hannibal took approximately one million selfies of them, and this is the one that made the cut. To be fair, the picture is a good one\u2014Maddie\u2019s expression is one of burbling joy, Hannibal is smiling gently, eyes crinkled, and Will looks relaxed and just\u2014blindingly happy.</p>\n<p>He was. He still is. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey get big so quickly,\u201d Mrs. Komeda says. \u201cHard to believe some days that my two have families of their own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever she\u2019s about to say next is forestalled by someone else elbowing in. \u201cDr. Lecter\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGraham-Lecter,\u201d she corrects coolly, taking his measure.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeg pardon,\u201d the stranger says. He\u2019s very tall, and there\u2019s a distinctive scar from surgery to remove a harelip.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo harm done,\u201d Hannibal says easily. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve been introduced. Dr. Hannibal Graham-Lecter.\u201d They shake hands, and then Hannibal says, \u201cThis is my husband, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPaul Crane,\u201d the man says, eyes fixed on Will\u2019s face\u2014and Will knows instantly that the name is a false one. When he shakes Will\u2019s hand, it\u2019s as if he simultaneously can\u2019t bear it and wants it too much. \u201cVery nice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lobby lights dim briefly. \u201cPerhaps we might resume our conversation during intermission,\u201d Hannibal says politely, but from the way his fingers tighten on Will\u2019s hip, Will thinks there\u2019s no fucking chance of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoy the show,\u201d Crane says, and Will feels a shiver run down his spine as Hannibal steers them away.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Opera is not precisely Will\u2019s thing, but he can admire the technical difficulty of the performance, and the music is pretty good. The story itself is kind of ancient tabloid-esque\u2014Druid priestess Norma and enemy Roman dude secretly wish for two children from the sky together, except he\u2019s a dick and even though she broke her vows for him, he\u2019s been hooking up with a younger priestess, who of course has no idea about part where he\u2019s cheating on Norma.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is riveted, and he clearly finds it far more emotionally affecting that Will does, which is an odd reversal of their usual positions. He grabs Will\u2019s hand during Norma and Adalgisa\u2019s duet and doesn\u2019t let go until the end of the first act, when he applauds fervently.</p>\n<p>Intermission is in some kind of fancy lounge, presumably for people who donate to the opera. All Will cares about is that there are fewer people around, although they all seem to want to talk to Hannibal. It\u2019s a weird kind of invisibility\u2014Will is introduced, hands are shaken, and then he\u2019s mostly ignored while he drinks whiskey more expensive than he usually indulges in. Hannibal drinks champagne and leaves one arm curled very possessively around Will\u2019s waist while he holds court with a blur of people. </p>\n<p>Will wonders briefly about the man from the lobby, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Somehow, he did not expect Hannibal to comprehensively lose his shit when Norma offers herself up as a sacrifice and then her Roman dirtbag boyfriend jumps onto the pyre with her, but he does. Hannibal weeps, and Will instinctively reaches for the diaper bag they do not have with them, which is ridiculous, because of course Hannibal is carrying an actual handkerchief.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we heading home?\u201d Will asks when they\u2019ve managed to escape outside and the valet brings the Bentley around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could,\u201d Hannibal says, and gives Will a close look. Will might chafe from that kind of scrutiny from anyone else, but he knows Hannibal just wants to make sure he\u2019s not overwhelmed or tired or otherwise in need of a retreat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d Will says, \u201cwe could\u2014get a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could,\u201d Hannibal says, voice lowered and a little raspy in a way that makes Will hot under the collar.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m told some people do that,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou know, on dates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal drives them to some place that doesn\u2019t have a sign over the door and is apparently some kind of modern hipster speakeasy, which makes Will want to roll his eyes. But they get a cozy little table in a corner with a curved velvet bench that means they\u2019re sitting right next to each other, and Hannibal\u2019s eyes shine in the dim lighting, and fine, maybe it is a little romantic.</p>\n<p>The cocktail menu is full of some unbelievable bullshit, but Hannibal orders an Old Fashioned, and Will follows his lead. While waiting for their drinks, Will takes a look around. They\u2019re maybe the most formally dressed, but they don\u2019t look out of place. For a moment, he imagines an alternate reality, one where he and Hannibal went on scores of dates just like this one, before they got married and wished a baby out of the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d Hannibal asks. They\u2019re sitting so closely that Hannibal doesn\u2019t need to speak about a murmur for Will to hear.</p>\n<p>Will is granted a temporary reprieve by the arrival of their drinks. He raises his glass and Hannibal does the same, clinking his glass against Will\u2019s before settling his arm along the edge of the booth behind Will\u2019s back. Hannibal, because he is fundamentally evil, takes advantage of the position to put his mouth nearly at Will\u2019s ear. \u201cWill,\u201d he says coaxingly.</p>\n<p>Will shivers a little\u2014Hannibal is distressingly familiar with Will\u2019s ear thing, and clearly not above using it to his advantage. \u201cI was just thinking of\u2014what if we\u2019d done this, you know, the normal way. Gone on dates first. Necked in public.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a request?\u201d Hannibal breathes, and bites gently at Will\u2019s earlobe.</p>\n<p>Will gasps, and then takes an unsteady sip of his drink. \u201cJust a hypothetical.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal is silent for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re neither of us normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure know how to sweet talk a guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Hannibal says, and it stops Will in his tracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d he says. \u201cEncephalitis, surprise baby, various psychopaths\u2014none of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d Hannibal says, soft but resolute. \u201cI want you just as you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says faintly. \u201cI\u2014 Hannibal\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinish your drink,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will pulls back just enough to look him in the eye. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go back just yet. I\u2019m not tired or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me rephrase: I would very much like to take you home.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Will says, and looks up through his eyelashes. \u201cWell. I guess that depends on what date this is. I wouldn\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal practically smolders at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here I was hoping you were going to take off these panties with your teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that perfect,\u201d Hannibal amends swiftly, and leaves more money than their check could possibly be on the table before taking Will by the hand and leading him out into the night.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The panties are a casualty, but Will suspects more will appear in his underwear drawer soon. Give him an inch, and Hannibal will take a mile, where a mile is probably even sluttier panties and a matching garter belt.</p>\n<p>Will sleeps the sleep of the very well-fucked, and when he first wakes up, Hannibal shushes him and tells him to go back to sleep. When he wakes again, he\u2019s alone in bed. He heads downstairs to find Hannibal putting the finishing touches on an impressive spread, and kisses him good morning. They have a leisurely brunch with Abigail, and Will says nothing at all about how well she\u2019s hidden the pizza box in the recycling.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a very peaceful Sunday.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Tuesday is a shitshow.</p>\n<p>Will has therapy in the morning, which in and of itself is not bad. Dr. Amrani seems like she is trying very hard to understand why Will doesn\u2019t feel threatened by Chesapeake Ripper.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou believe he killed Abel Gideon for you,\u201d she says slowly.</p>\n<p>Will gives her a short, impatient nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will makes himself look her in the eye. She\u2019s a good person, a kind person. He\u2019s told her some fucked up shit already. He doesn\u2019t trust her as much as he trusts Hannibal, but maybe that\u2019s not a fair comparison.</p>\n<p>He takes in a deep breath. \u201cIt made me feel\u2014safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ripper thinks of his victims as little better than pigs. If he thought of me like that, he wouldn\u2019t have gifted me with Gideon\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it a gift? What did he get out of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>That part is a little more uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he feels the way normal people do. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of it. But he got my attention, that\u2019s for sure. Beyond that\u2014he took organs, as usual\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he do with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will thinks about <i>what did he get out of it</i> and <i>sounders of three or four</i> and then he closes his eyes in sudden realization. \u201cHe\u2019s eating them,\u201d he says with bone-dead certainty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I have to call Jack right away\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks slightly shaken, but covers for it well and waves him in the direction of her waiting room.</p>\n<p>Jack picks up right away. \u201cWill, tell me your butt is in that car I sent and you\u2019re on your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat car?\u201d Will asks. \u201cJack, the Chesapeake Ripper is a cannibal, that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing with the organs\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you can ask him all about it as soon as you get here. We found Miriam Lass alive early this morning, and she knows who the Ripper is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Will asks, flabbergasted.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Frederick Chilton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to be fucking kidding me,\u201d Will hisses, and hangs up to call Hannibal to let him know he won\u2019t be able to come home to watch Maddie during Hannibal\u2019s afternoon appointments.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Alana is questioning Chilton when Will gets there. He joins Jack and Miriam Lass, who are watching on the other side of the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is completely absurd!\u201d Chilton protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cA missing FBI trainee escaped from your basement, Frederick,\u201d Alana says, her tone measured.</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes extravagantly. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously think I kept someone in my basement for <i>two years</i>\u2014I can\u2019t even keep houseplants alive for a week!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d Will asks quietly. It\u2019s not\u2014it can\u2019t be. It feels completely wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeverly is running analysis on evidence found in his basement,\u201d Jack says. He\u2019s laser-focused on the interaction unfolding in the interview room.</p>\n<p>Miriam is wound tight. There\u2019s no way she should be in this room right now. Jack must have done it over Alana\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p>\u201cMiriam,\u201d Will says, as gently as he would to a wounded animal. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s trembling. Her voice is rusty with disuse but firm as she says, \u201cIt\u2019s him. He\u2019s the Ripper.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s ludicrous. After two years of keeping her captive, the Ripper just\u2014allows her to escape? It can\u2019t have been an accident.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I ask you some questions?\u201d Will asks her. Jack frowns at him from behind Miriam\u2019s back, but Will just tilts his head toward the door and says, \u201cThe cafeteria still makes terrible coffee.\u201d </p>\n<p>She nods slowly. They make their way to the cafeteria, and he follows her as she makes a beeline for the coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I ate food,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cNot a feeding tube. I\u2019d look worse if it had been that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to try some?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>She settles on oatmeal, which is probably the safest choice, all things considered. The coffee is safe for no one, but he\u2019s not going to stand in her way.</p>\n<p>She takes one sip of coffee and makes a face. \u201cIt feels like no time has passed at all. It\u2019s\u2014hard to believe it\u2019s been two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>She closes her eyes. \u201cI never saw his face. Just a bright light. He told me I was in a safe place. And I think I remember some other things, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re real, or\u2014\u201d she trails off.</p>\n<p>They both know what trauma can do to memory.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat things seem like they weren\u2019t real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard a baby crying,\u201d she says, bewildered. \u201cAnd I heard someone singing, but I don\u2019t think it was him. It went like\u2014\u201d she hums a little bit, and it takes Will a moment to realize it\u2019s Bowie\u2019s <i>Starman</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Will makes himself ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cA song my music box used to play when I was a kid,\u201d she says, with a deprecating smile. \u201cKind of doubt the Ripper has a baby and my music box with its dancing ballerina inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat definitely wasn\u2019t in my profile,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>And then he thinks: god fucking dammit, <i>Hannibal</i>.<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nProbably Jack intends for him to stay, but Will grabs a junior agent who was in his class two years ago\u2014he struggled in class, but actually made an effort to come to office hours to do better, which was the kind of thing Will remembered\u2014and asked him to drive him home to Baltimore.</p>\n<p>Will is so furious he\u2019s nearly numb with it.</p>\n<p>He knows that a normal person would walk in the door, grab the baby, and run. A normal person would be terrified. A normal person might vomit from the knowledge that his husband has been killing people and almost definitely feeding him their organs.</p>\n<p>Will is not and never has been normal. </p>\n<p>By the time he walks in the front door, he\u2019s spoiling for the most apocalyptic first married fight in the history of humanity. It takes some of the wind out of his sails to find Hannibal giving Maddie a bottle in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Will says. \u201cDid you find someone to watch Maddie this afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal shakes his head. \u201cI did several of my appointments over the phone. Not ideal, but workable in an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>An emergency of his own damn making. Unfuckingbelievable.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Will says tightly.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyebrows go up. God only knows what he\u2019s imagining this is about. Childcare. Backyard renovations. How fucking cold his feet are when he tangles his legs up with Will\u2019s in bed. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll put Madeleine down for her nap, and join you in the sitting room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will nods shortly and stalks off to the room to wait. When Hannibal comes back downstairs, he sits on the sofa and aims an attentive look at Will. \u201cWhat would you like to discuss?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will sits down in a chair, then immediately springs back up. He\u2019s full of a nervous, angry energy, and he can\u2019t be still right now. He strides over the fireplace. Their wedding pictures on the mantel look back at him, and he lets his eyes slide shut for just a moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our house, right. Yours and mine, together,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>He turns to look at Hannibal, who nods cautiously. \u201cI had you added to the deed for this house and the rest of my properties. You signed the paperwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will barely remembers that, but it\u2019s not the point. \u201cThis is our <i>home</i>,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a life here\u2014you and me and Maddie, and Abigail and the dogs. Tell me you understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal nods again. \u201cYes, Will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I should get a say over any houseguests,\u201d Will bites out. \u201cYou tell me right now, Hannibal\u2014is there anyone else in our basement?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s expression goes disturbingly blank. \u201cWill\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Will hisses. \u201cYou just shut up and <i>listen</i>. This isn\u2019t just you, anymore\u2014and I can\u2019t believe I have to specify this, but here is what I am not okay with: you keeping hostages and murdering serial killers in our <i>basement</i>. As in, in the same house with our daughter, who is going to be crawling and then walking before we know it. How fucking dare you take that kind of risk?\u201d </p>\n<p>Hannibal has the gall to look both offended and a little hurt. \u201cI assure you, I took every precaution.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not good enough for me,\u201d Will says. \u201cYou got lucky. The soundproofing isn\u2019t as good as you think it is, because Miriam Lass heard me singing to our baby, and now we have to hope that your stupid fucking brainwashing holds and that Jack doesn\u2019t get curious, or I\u2019m going to be single parenting and you\u2019re going to be\u2014you\u2019re going to be\u2014\u201d he stops, because taking in a breath is surprisingly hard just then, and his eyes prick with tears. \u201cTell me something\u2014 can you stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did stop,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay first of all\u2014you didn\u2019t stop, you made murder art out of Gideon and wrapped it in a bow for me, and second of all\u2014you haven\u2019t stopped because you wanted to. You stopped because you, what, didn\u2019t have time for all your hobbies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChildrearing and marriage on top of a full practice is quite time-consuming,\u201d Hannibal admits.</p>\n<p>Will gives him a flat stare, and stalks over to where Hannibal is sitting and looks down at him. \u201cThis stops. Right now. You don\u2019t bring anyone into the house without running it past me. That\u2019s some basic common courtesy. Promise me that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal tilts his head up to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to forbid it altogether?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d have to regret you killing Gideon,\u201d Will says. He puts his hands on Hannibal\u2019s shoulders and leans down. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyes are wide as he gazes up at Will, as if he were the most extraordinary thing under the sun. \u201cYou liked my gift, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI liked it, except for the part where you recklessly endangered our family. If we\u2019re in this together, I get veto power.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould that be enough for you? Would you be content to have my leash?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a short fucking leash to start with,\u201d Will says, and it sends a thrill down his spine, which he is aware is fucked up, but this is all fucked up and he wants Hannibal all the same. \u201cPromise me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Hannibal says, with all the solemnity of his wedding vows.</p>\n<p>All the fight goes out of Will then. He kneels on the couch, straddling Hannibal\u2019s lap, and tucks his face against Hannibal\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI should make you sleep on the couch for like, a year,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s arms encircle him carefully, as if uncertain of his welcome.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to clean out the freezer, you cocky asshole. I can\u2019t believe no one\u2019s figured it out before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cClever boy, it could only have been you.\u201d He strokes Will\u2019s nape unsteadily.</p>\n<p>Will feels shaky, himself. He clings to Hannibal and Hannibal clings right back. \u201cAre we\u2014okay?\u201d Will asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe compromised to resolve a conflict,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing rather well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will takes in a steadying breath and lets it out slowly. \u201cSo, what. Is it time for makeup sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we\u2019re quick,\u201d Hannibal says, and then Will kisses him and they frantically undo each other\u2019s belts.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The next morning, Jack calls while Will is feeding Maddie and Hannibal is making breakfast.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill, that case I had you look at\u2014he killed an entire family last night. I have an agent on the way to pick you up\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJack,\u201d Will interrupts. He looks at Hannibal\u2014anyone else might be afraid of a killer on the loose, but Will holds the leash of the Chesapeake Ripper and it makes him feel safer than any security system. It makes him feel <i>powerful</i>, and he finds the strength to do what he needs to do to keep his family safe in turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cJack, I quit.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>GWU falls all over itself to admit Will to its brand new forensic psychology PhD program, and snaps him up to teach an intro course for the fall semester.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could look maybe a little surprised,\u201d Will grouses when he gives Hannibal the news that night over dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an alumnus of the program, and you taught at the FBI Academy for several years,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI assume they gave you a full fellowship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will narrows his eyes, and then heaves a sigh. \u201cYes. And they want to put a profile of me on the website.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal looks unbearably smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis means we really have to figure out an actual childcare situation, you know.\u201d Will puts another spoonful of pureed sweet potato in Maddie\u2019s mouth. Hannibal makes all the baby food, which is probably just as well, because it turns out their child can identify organic produce and at seven months, already has some very strong opinions about food. He wonders if she\u2019ll ever go through a mac and cheese only phase as a toddler. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to speak with you about that,\u201d Hannibal says, and dabs at his mouth with a napkin. \u201cAbigail has done very well with Madeleine. Perhaps we might negotiate a live-in arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will eats a few bites of his own dinner before getting another spoonful into Maddie. \u201cShe needs her own space. A crappy apartment with roommates is part of the college experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal makes a moue of distaste.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be such a nightmare when Maddie goes to college,\u201d Will says with fond exasperation. \u201cWe can talk to Abigail about watching Maddie when I\u2019m on campus, as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with her class schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course her education must come first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will manages to eat more of his dinner. It\u2019s gone slightly cold, which he knows drives Hannibal a little wild, but if Hannibal insists on them eating dinner together, it\u2019s the price one of them has to pay. Maddie\u2019s got sweet potato smeared around her mouth, and Hannibal is giving her a besotted look.</p>\n<p>Will sighs and relents, just a little. \u201cI know you\u2019re going to pay her rent, and I don\u2019t even mind. Just don\u2019t go overboard on the place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDear Will,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cI would never.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t, but only because Abigail is shockingly sensible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get used to this,\u201d Abigail says to Will in a quiet moment. \u201cI need to be able to stand on my own two feet when I graduate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will wraps one arm around her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be alright,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd\u2014it\u2019s okay to ask for help if you need it. You\u2019re not going to stop being part of our family when you\u2019re done with school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mouth quirks up into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have like, five kids by then. That\u2019s a lot of saving for college in your future.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Will insists. \u201cTwo kids is plenty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d she says, with affectionate disbelief.</p>\n<p>Predictably, Hannibal redirects his impulses to a new wardrobe for Will for the fall semester. And because Will does, in fact, love him, he lets Hannibal talk him into all sorts of things that are finer and more expensive than he would ever buy for himself.</p>\n<p>In any case: it keeps Hannibal occupied, and an occupied Hannibal is one that doesn\u2019t have time to ask Will for any particular <i>permission</i>.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Online coursework is basically Will\u2019s <i>dream</i>. He doesn\u2019t have to talk to anyone\u2014the most interaction he has to do is read frankly misguided discussion posts from his small cohort of fellow doctoral students, and since part of his course participation is to respond to said posts, he\u2019s getting points for telling them specifically how wrong they are.</p>\n<p>He does his coursework and preps for the class he\u2019s teaching while Madeleine naps, and makes good use of the train ride to and from campus on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss being able to drive,\u201d he tells Hannibal that night when they\u2019ve settled down in bed. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll keep taking the train to campus even when I\u2019m cleared. It helps me plug through grading.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how are your students, Professor Graham-Lecter?\u201d Hannibal leans in to kiss his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey exist,\u201d Will says, and tilts his head to give Hannibal more access.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny particular teacher\u2019s pets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI changed my workplace, not my personality,\u201d Will says acerbically.</p>\n<p>He can feel Hannibal\u2019s smile against his skin before he takes Will\u2019s earlobe between his teeth. Will gasps a little, and then Hannibal kisses down his neck and starts to suck a mark into his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit,\u201d Will says, but it comes out like a breathy plea for more.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow else will I make certain your bevy of adoring undergrads know you\u2019re spoken for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a ring on my finger,\u201d Will points out. Hannibal just sucks another stinging kiss where his neck meets his shoulder. \u201cLet me guess\u2014you think I need a pearl necklace.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal sticks a hand down Will\u2019s shorts. \u201cWell, since you suggested it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will laughs a little, but the laugh peters out into a moan as Hannibal wraps his hand around him, and then Hannibal yanks the cover down and pulls Will\u2019s shorts off, and replaces his hand with his mouth. Hannibal\u2019s blowjobs were plenty good when they first started having sex, but now\u2014now Hannibal knows exactly what makes Will tick, and he doesn\u2019t hesitate to get one slick finger in Will to play with his prostate while he mouths at the head of Will\u2019s cock. It makes Will plant his feet into the mattress and push up into Hannibal\u2019s mouth, and push down and ride Hannibal\u2019s finger, and he writhes and pants and swears and then says, \u201cFuck me already, you know you want to be in me, you know you want\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal pulls off, and then he settles between Will\u2019s legs and Hannibal doesn\u2019t even bother with more fingers, just slicks his cock up and pushes in, slow and confident.</p>\n<p>\u201cMight as well admit you want to tattoo me,\u201d Will says, digging his heel into Hannibal\u2019s back. \u201cMight as well admit you want to be so deep inside me, no one else can ever touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s eyes are dark, and Will almost registers the sound of Hannibal smacking his ass before he feels it. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYours,\u201d Will says, still reverberating with pleasure. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal does\u2014again, and again, and again, and Will feels like he\u2019s out of his mind with how good it feels, how much he wants it, wants more, wants Hannibal\u2019s mark on his skin, indelible, permanent\u2014</p>\n<p>Hannibal comes with a snarl, and he doesn\u2019t even take a moment to catch his breath before he flips Will over and sticks his tongue in Will\u2019s ass, licking and sucking his come out of his hole, and Will sobs and groans and shakes apart, coming over the sheets underneath.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to tattoo your name on my ass, we\u2019re getting a professional,\u201d Will warns him sleepily. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much you\u2019ve practiced.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal presses a kiss to his hole, long and lingering. \u201cMarriage is a compromise, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Hannibal, being an unmitigated asshole, gets him an actual pearl necklace. It seems nice, not that Will knows anything about pearls. He\u2019ll give Hannibal this, though\u2014it does look pretty banging with the ivory lingerie that has its own special drawer in the closet.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>As an adjunct, Will has what amounts to a closet for an office that he shares with another adjunct who he never sees. Since he only uses the room for office hours and as a receptacle for his campus mail, he doesn\u2019t much mind.</p>\n<p>The first letter comes in a campus mail envelope. His name and office number are scribbled on the front, and he assumes it\u2019s yet another flyer for some campus event that someone is hoping he\u2019ll post on his office door.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not. It\u2019s handwritten letter, effusive in its praise and unsettling in its fixation on him.</p>\n<p><i>Professor Graham-Lecter</i>, it begins. <i>I think you\u2019re the only one who can help me Become</i>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first disturbing letter Will has ever received; this one isn\u2019t even particularly threatening. His mailbox at the Academy was stuffed full of letters Will had no desire to read after shooting Garrett Jacob Hobbs.</p>\n<p>The letter has a Chinese character at the end in lieu of a signature\u2014it doesn\u2019t take him long to figure out that it\u2019s the character for dragon. Part of him wants to roll his eyes, because this reads like white male, 30-40, and frankly, Will would like this person to take their culturally appropriative crazy somewhere else. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s one of his students\u2014he has a whole lecture hall full of fresh-faced undergrads, and very few nontraditional students.</p>\n<p>He thinks about trying to get prints off the letter, but he knows there won\u2019t be any. He tucks the letter in his bag, and between teaching and his own coursework, not to mention Maddie getting alarmingly better at crawling, it goes decidedly on the backburner.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearly a month before he receives another letter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not really a letter at all. It\u2019s a photocopy of a painting in what seems to be an art history textbook. The caption says it\u2019s a painting by Blake\u2014<i>The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In Sun</i>. The Dragon\u2019s tail is curled around the woman, and below it, his mystery correspondent has written:</p>\n<p>\n<i>You didn\u2019t recognize me when we met. But you will when I Become.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Will sighs, and texts Beverly. She\u2019s waiting for him at the back of his classroom when he wraps up his lecture on criminal insanity.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking pretty sharp,\u201d she says, giving him a once over.</p>\n<p>He narrows his eyes at her, but she just grins at him. He leads the way to his office\u2014\u201cNice closet,\u201d Beverly says\u2014and he shows her both letters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be any evidence,\u201d he says. \u201cBut just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>She takes the letters in the plastic bags he\u2019s stored them in. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait for a second one to call me,\u201d she says, and her eyes are concerned. \u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t threats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but you\u2019re also the person who doesn\u2019t think the Chesapeake Ripper was threatening you, so let\u2019s agree that our definitions of \u2018things that should freak you out\u2019 don\u2019t look anything alike.\u201d</p>\n<p>It seems like forever ago. He remembers that smiling would be inappropriate. \u201cThis person thinks I can help them. If he\u2019s telling the truth, he\u2019s met me before. He could have come to my class\u2014a lot of people came during the add/drop period, and I had to turn them away because the class was full.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to turn these over to campus police?\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives her a look that he hopes adequately conveys his scathing disdain. It earns him a snort of amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know what I find,\u201d she says. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get some lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal, of course, packed him a lunch, but Will gamely follows her off to the horror that is the student union in search of cheese fries.</p>\n<p>At home that night, he shows Hannibal pictures he took of both letters. Hannibal is intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe believes you a source of wisdom, a guide,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cThis is a very shy boy, Will. He will not emerge from the shadows until he is driven to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy whom,\u201d Hannibal corrects, eyes hooded as he gazes upon the Dragon.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Will says. \u201cI know this is probably really plebeian, but can we go traditional for Thanksgiving and pass on the turducken this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal tastes the sauce he\u2019s stirring on the stove and puts the spoon down. Maddie toddles on unsteady feet into his legs and holds up a plastic cup for him to take. \u201cThank you, my darling,\u201d he says, very sincerely. Maddie looks overjoyed and babbles at him. He hands the cup back to her. \u201cPlease take this to daddy,\u201d he says, and Maddie begins the laborious process of making her way back to Will, before collapsing halfway in the middle of the kitchen floor next to a pile of her other plastic kitchen toys, and Winston, who views Maddie as a convenient purveyor of all kinds of snacks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not planning on a turducken,\u201d Hannibal says, and Will can hear the air quotes.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, you were probably planning on that with a goose in there, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal\u2019s amused-despite-himself smile is all in his eyes. \u201cAnd if I was not planning on a goose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will gives him a look. \u201cYou fell asleep on me last night,\u201d he reminds him. \u201cNew house rule: you\u2019re too tired for sex, you\u2019re too tired for anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI assure you, I won\u2019t be too tired tonight,\u201d Hannibal says.</p>\n<p>It sends a frisson of heat down Will\u2019s spine. He looks at Hannibal up through his lashes, just a little flirty. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maddie chooses that moment to reign joyful destruction upon her pile of plastic kitchenware, and then tries to put her teething ring back in her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s warm now, baby,\u201d he tells her, when she gums at it unhappily. \u201cHannibal, can you give her a hand?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal obediently pulls a frozen teething toy in the shape of a hand out of the freezer.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s still not funny,\u201d Will tells him.</p>\n<p>They look at their child, gnawing on a blue plastic hand. Hannibal arches an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s maybe a little funny,\u201d Will concedes.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been ten years since he experienced finals week as a student, and time has dulled his memory of how much work has be done in a short period of time, and now it\u2019s compounded with his teaching duties. He makes up a schedule and tries to stick to it as much as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the worst,\u201d he complains to Hannibal one night.</p>\n<p>\u201cI also found myself having to relearn how to be a student when I went back for psychiatry,\u201d Hannibal says. \u201cIt was challenging with adult responsibilities I did not have in medical school, and I did not have a family then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes me feel a little better,\u201d Will says, and kisses him, because honestly, Hannibal is always pretty great at telling Will what he needs to hear.</p>\n<p>He turns in his final papers, and somehow finishes all of his grading and makeup exams, and takes his stack of final exams home to grade. He has until Tuesday to turn the grades in, but he\u2019d like to get through as much as possible before the holiday party Hannibal talked him into letting them host this weekend.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s grading in the sitting room when he opens one blue book to find the Dragon\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n<p>\n<i>It\u2019s not enough. I need more\u2014I need your help to find what I need to Become.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Will frowns. The rest of the book is full of more of the same, all of it vague and unhinged and talking about needing to consume power. The last page says: <i>You will See me.</i></p>\n<p>He scrubs his eyes. He\u2019s too tired for this shit, and he has another 75 exams to grade. His phone is charging in the kitchen, so he sighs and levers himself out of his chair. Beverly will want to know right away, and frankly, it\u2019s probably time to let campus police and his department chair know as well.</p>\n<p>Hannibal is upstairs giving Maddie her bath and going through her bedtime routine, which is why Will freezes when he hears the floor creak right outside the back door mudroom. He slides a knife out of the block on the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he says steadily, a kind of calm coming over him from his years as a beat cop.</p>\n<p>He sees a shadow move, and a tall figure comes just enough into the light that Will can see his face. He\u2019s met this man once before\u2014fuck, at the opera, he\u2019s been stalking Will for six months <i>at least</i>\u2014no, more than that, it wasn\u2019t the Tooth Fairy who broke into his house in Wolf Trap, it was \u2014</p>\n<p>It was him. This man, the Tooth Fairy, the Great Red Dragon, they\u2019re one and the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor,\u201d the Dragon says. \u201cI need your help. I need to find the Chesapeake Ripper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will does the least helpful thing he could do in the moment: he laughs, because <i>of-fucking-course</i>.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He has a serial killer in his house who wants to talk to him, and it\u2019s not the one he married. Hannibal is going to come downstairs at any minute, and Will knows the Dragon has been watching them for weeks, and he\u2019ll be prepared to kill them all if he\u2019s startled. He may be planning on it anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you,\u201d Will says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you know,\u201d the Dragon says. \u201cYou must know. He killed for you, he must\u2014he must\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Will adjusts his grip on the knife he\u2019s holding behind his back. \u201cHe must what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe gave you power. He clothed you in sun and crowned you with stars. How could he, unless you See him?\u201d He sounds anguished, and in that moment, Will sees not the Dragon, but the man, and this one has loved and fears for the one he loves, so much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you,\u201d Will repeats softly.</p>\n<p>The Dragon twitches. \u201cYou won\u2019t help me. You won\u2019t, but you know,\u201d he says heavily. His shoulder shift and his body moves sinuously, restlessly. \u201cI will consume the Ripper\u2019s power, and I will Become, and you will bear witness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will imagines ten ways to incapacitate him, and then the Dragon says, \u201cI will persuade you,\u201d and heads for the door out of the kitchen that leads for the hall and the stairs to the second floor.</p>\n<p>And in that moment, Will knows he cannot allow it, that if the Dragon leaves this room, he will rain destruction on his family and his home.</p>\n<p>Before he crosses the threshold, Will clenches his hand around the handle of Hannibal\u2019s knife and stabs the Dragon in the back, once, twice, blood spilling over his hands before the Dragon roars and turns on him.</p>\n<p>The Dragon has the advantage of both height, reach, and weight. Will has the advantage of having delivered a serious wound and being in his own home, and he is sure as fuck not going to go down here, not when Hannibal and Maddie are depending on him. He keeps the kitchen island between them, but he\u2019s not entirely expecting the Dragon to rush him, vaulting the island to get within reach.</p>\n<p>Will grabs the cast iron skillet off the stove, and his first swing is off target\u2014he gets the Dragon in the shoulder, who grunts and falls back a few steps. It\u2019s just the time Will needs to heft the skillet again, and this time, swing it hard into the Dragon\u2019s skull, which drops him like a rock. He\u2019s dazed but still grabs for Will and brings him down to his knees before grabbing for Will\u2019s throat, and the knife handle is slippery with blood but Will hangs on, and stabs the Dragon over and over and over until Hannibal\u2019s voice breaks his trance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, Will,\u201d he says gently.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s blood everywhere, and Will is breathing hard, and in that moment, he\u2019s never felt more victorious, more alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaddie\u2014is Maddie okay?\u201d he asks, adrenaline thrumming through his veins.</p>\n<p>\u201cMadeleine and I are perfectly safe,\u201d Hannibal assures him. He looks at Will with such awe, with such all-consuming love that Will thinks the Dragon was half right. Hannibal gave him power, but it was to have something worth defending at all costs. Will himself slew the Dragon in defense of hearth and home, and he stands over his corpse with no remorse or regret.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe one regret. \u201cSorry about your knife,\u201d Will says. The edge is probably all fucked up. \u201cAnd your pan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my love,\u201d Hannibal breathes, and pulls Will into his arms, blood and all. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Every knife I have is yours. Will, my darling, you\u2019re <i>glorious</i>, you\u2019re perfect\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Will kisses him, because that\u2019s about enough goopy cannibal lovetalk, and also, he needs in Hannibal\u2019s pants <i>right now</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get him down to the basement first,\u201d Hannibal says, stilling Will\u2019s hands at his belt buckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Will says. He has an almost out of body experience when he looks at the blood-covered floor. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to replace the flooring in here before your party this weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell worth it,\u201d Hannibal says, and kisses him again before going to fetch plastic sheeting.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Epilogue:</p>\n<p>Will didn\u2019t fight Hannibal very hard about Paris for their second wedding anniversary. They go over New Year\u2019s, which is kind of insane and a lot of people, but since they leave Maddie with Alana and her new wife, it\u2019s not as stressful as it would have been with a two-year-old.</p>\n<p>Paris is a glittering dream, and Will appreciates the chance to walk along the avenues in the evening, Hannibal\u2019s gloved hand in his. But he\u2019s glad to come home, glad to pick up Maddie from Alana and Margot\u2019s house.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was so good,\u201d Margot says. She rests a hand on the rounded curve of her stomach, and she and Alana trade a smile. Maddie is sleepy-eyed and attached to Hannibal\u2019s leg like she\u2019s never going to let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d Will says, and Hannibal hefts Maddie up into his arms and they say their goodbyes and get the dogs and Maddie settled in the car.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re home, Hannibal pulls a container of bolognese out of the freezer, because he\u2019s pathological about clearing out the fridge so nothing spoils when they\u2019re out of town, but also refuses the concept of post-vacation takeout, so this is his version of a compromise.</p>\n<p>Will doesn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s delicious, and he doesn\u2019t even give Hannibal any grief over having frozen fresh pasta to go with the meal, too. Maddie should sit in her booster seat, but Hannibal lets her sit in his lap and feeds her off his plate, so evidently, they\u2019re all feeling a little clingy tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can go to the grocery store in the morning,\u201d Will says. \u201cHow are we doing on freezer space?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hannibal purses his lips in thought. \u201cStill quite full.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which stands to reason\u2014Will let him kill Mason Verger just before the holidays, which both got Margot and Alana out from under his hideously abusive thumb, and neatly solved the problem of what to get Hannibal for Christmas.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry to restrain yourself at the butcher\u2019s, then,\u201d Will says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI make no promises,\u201d Hannibal says. He looks a little travel-worn, but there\u2019s a soft happiness to his expression that Will wants to look at forever. \u201cOne more bite?\u201d he asks Maddie, who obediently opens her mouth for a little more Verger-free bolognese, because Hannibal takes parenting very seriously and refuses to feed their child any meat that isn\u2019t organic and free-range. Apparently, monstrous pedophiles who have put god knows what in their bodies don\u2019t make the cut.</p>\n<p>After they put Maddie to bed, they decide to turn in early.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy body doesn\u2019t know what time zone we\u2019re in,\u201d Will complains when he slides into bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been 24 hours since your last suppressant,\u201d Hannibal says after a moment.</p>\n<p>Will\u2019s brow furrows as he does the math. \u201cCrap,\u201d he says, and sits up to get out of bed to go take it.</p>\n<p>Hannibal stops him with a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWill,\u201d he says softly, meaningfully. His entire heart is in his eyes. \u201cWhat would you say to expanding our family?\u201d</p>\n<p>Will leans down and kisses him. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wish very hard, I hear,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Hannibal pulls him close and then rolls them over. \u201cTonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe might not get it on the first try,\u201d Will warns him, because someone around here has to temper expectations, and it\u2019s clearly not going to be Hannibal \u2018Overachiever\u2019 Graham-Lecter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot with that kind of attitude,\u201d Hannibal mutters as he sucks a kiss into Will\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I could make a suggestion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Will tries not to smile, and murmurs in Hannibal\u2019s ear, \u201cFuck me like you\u2019re going to put a baby in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Hannibal breathes, and does his very best, which is very good, indeed.</p>\n<p>The next morning, Will wakes up to hear the dogs barking their heads off downstairs, and he smiles.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
