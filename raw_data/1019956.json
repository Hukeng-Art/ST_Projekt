There is no room for anything else until you cast out fear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Where I thought it necessary, I have added translations for the Golic Vulcan used in this fic at the end of each chapter.

All mistakes made in implementing them into this fic/using them/changing them about to fit my purpose are my fault, though.

  "text": "<p>Jim awoke and instantly noticed that he was tied down.<br><br>\nHe was used to that by now, except that the wide circles keeping his wrists and ankles carefully in place were of a much softer material than usual. They felt sturdy and tight on his skin, but nothing like the shackles the Romulans had used so far.<br><br>\nHis heart jumped in his chest as memories assaulted him: his own hoarse screams ringing in his ears, his body convulsing with pain, cruel grins on sharp faces.<br><br>\nTrembling, Jim forced himself to stay calm and assess his environment instead of letting himself panic. For once, he wasn\u2019t in any serious pain. He wasn\u2019t being strangled, cut, beaten or otherwise tortured.<br><br>\nClearly, something had changed. Jim could not let that opportunity pass.<br><br>\nThere was grit in his eyes, blurring his vision. Jim squeezed his eyelids closed and opened them again until the worst had passed and he could look around without it stinging too badly.<br><br>\nIt was clear he had been moved. There were no black cables and tubes above him, no musky blue lights, no sounds of machinery, no warp drive humming. Instead, the room was engulfed in a pleasantly orange hue. All was quiet. Jim couldn't hear anything besides his own muted breathing and the rush of blood in his ears.<br><br>\nOr ear, he realized. Only the right one was picking up on sounds. His left ear did not seem to function properly. He felt the sudden urge to jam a finger into it to get rid of the numbness, but his wrists were caught in his restraints.<br><br>\nRight. Tied down. He was still a prisoner.<br><br>\nAnother burst of panic threatened to constrict his throat, to break the control on his breathing and make him thrash, but he didn't let it. There was nobody here ready to torture him right now. He was not in any pain, unless he counted a slight headache and the odd feeling in his left ear.<br><br>\nHe hadn\u2019t been this lucid in, what, weeks? Months? He had to stay calm, make the best of it.<br><br>\nOnce he made sure nobody was concealing themselves in the room, he might be able to risk moving his head to get a better view of his new surroundings. Might even find a means to escape. For that plan to succeed though, he would need to stay still a little longer and simply wait; assess.<br><br>\nHe counted to a hundred in his head, then back to zero.<br><br>\nStill, there was no noise, no sign of an imminent attack, no threat of strong hands grabbing him. Finally bracing himself, Jim very carefully curled his neck, lifted his head off its bedding and turned it to his right.<br><br>\nThis was definitely not Nero's ship. Instead, there were dark brown walls and an egg-shaped window that allowed warm sunlight to filter into the room. Jim made out what looked like the back of a monitor to his right. The cot he was lying on, he realized, had to be some sort of biobed.<br><br>\nNow that he thought about it, it was a lot more comfortable than the hard, unyielding rack Nero's men had strapped him to.<br><br>\nFailing to suppress a full-body shudder, Jim was startled by a short but clear beeping noise echoing through the room. Flinching, Jim let his head fall back onto the cot immediately, ceasing all movement.<br><br>\nNot a second later, Jim could hear rapid footfalls.<br><br>\nClosing his eyes and schooling his features into what he hoped was a natural looking representation of unconsciousness, Jim forced himself to relax on the bed. Whoever was approaching unerringly made their way towards him until Jim seemed to sense their warm presence on his skin.<br><br>\n\"You are awake, <em>oveh</em>.\"<br><br>\nJim did not move, though his thoughts were racing. Whoever it was that had approached spoke only slightly accented Standard. If he knew for sure it was a Humanoid speaking, he'd say it was a female.<br><br>\nThere had been no females on Nero's ship as far as he had known. Still, this might very well be a trap. He was tied down in an unfamiliar location with no memory of how he had got here. Anything might have happened to him.<br><br>\n\"You are afraid. <em>Dakh'uh pthak</em>. No harm will come to you here.\"<br><br>\nA spark of knowledge lit up Jim's mind. <em>Pthak?</em> Dimly remembering his Golic lessons from his second year at the Academy, he was almost completely sure it was a Vulcan word, meaning <em>fear</em>.<br><br>\nHis captors were \u2026 Vulcan? From the clipped but calm tone of the voice, it seemed possible. Yet it made no sense at all. Why would Vulcans tie him down like a prisoner? It was more likely the Romulan language shared some features with Vulcan, given their common ancestry. Just because Jim had been too out of it to pick up on it before didn\u2019t have to mean it wasn\u2019t true.<br><br>\n\"I see you are not assured of my good intentions, <em>oveh</em>,\" the voice continued, betraying no emotion. \"I shall return with somebody in which you might have more faith.\"<br><br>\nAs the sounds of footsteps faded away again, Jim risked a glance. He was too late though, only catching a glimpse of Human-like limbs, a blue robe and a head of dark hair before they were gone. Not much to go on. Might as well be any Humanoid species in the galaxy. Might very well be a Romulan.<br><br>\nMight also be a Vulcan. Maybe they had finally come and--<br><br>\nNo. It was stupid to get his hopes up. The first thing he had told himself after waking up on Nero's ship was that he could not hope, that he was for all intents and purposes already dead. He had effectively committed suicide. He could not show weakness by expecting Starfleet to rescue him, could not give Nero something to exploit.<br><br>\nHe'd bet good credits that that was what the Romulans were hoping for: make him feel safe, only to go for another round of mindless torture. In the end there, he hadn't really been aware of anything but pain anymore. Perhaps they wanted him lucid before they continued to make him scream.<br><br>\nJim's hands involuntarily curled into tight fists as phantom pain seemed to seep through every part of his body, shaking him.<br><br>\nMaybe Nero had brought him to this universe's Romulus to nurse him back to health. To be able to break him again, torture him anew. An endless cycle. It would explain the sickbay-like surroundings, the different light, the lack of pain.<br><br>\nA cold shiver ran through Jim's frame and his breath hitched.<br><br>\nMore footfalls, and he hurriedly forced himself to relax again, slackening his face as far as possible. His heart was still racing, though. If this was indeed a biobed, the readings had to be off the chart. Nobody would believe he was still out of it. It was ridiculous. He wouldn't be able to keep up the charade, but being tied down and completely disoriented, he didn't have a much better plan at hand.<br><br>\nAgain, somebody was standing next to his bed.<br><br>\n\"There is no reason to fear, Mr. Kirk.\"<br><br>\nJim's eyes flew open instantly.<br><br>\n\"<em>Spock?</em>\" he croaked.<br><br>\nHis voice sounded like somebody had stepped on broken glass. Jim coughed, feeling like something had caught in his throat, choking him. Unable to hold up a hand as he was tied down, he helplessly convulsed on the cot as one cough turned into a small fit.<br><br>\nSteady hands pressed instantly against his chest, gently but firmly keeping him down until the worst had passed. Though they did nothing but hold him in place, the hands felt soothing. Pleasant cool bled through whatever it was he was currently wearing, seemingly easing the pain inside.<br><br>\nVery slowly, Jim relaxed against the cot.<br><br>\n\"Spock,\" he repeated wheezily, eyes teary.<br><br>\n\"Yes, Mr. Kirk,\" Spock said. \"It is very satisfactory to see you awake and lucid.\"<br><br>\nJim could do nothing but stare at the Vulcan. He looked almost exactly like Jim remembered him from the hearing and the <i>Enterprise</i>: slanted brows, straight bangs, severe expression, except that his Starfleet uniform was missing. Instead, he was wearing what seemed to be simple gray robes.<br><br>\n\"I'm on Vulcan?\" Jim managed through his aching throat.<br><br>\n\"Affirmative, Mr. Kirk. You have been recuperating in Shi'Khar Hospital for the past two weeks.\"<br><br>\n\"Hospital?\" Feeling slightly light-headed, Jim tugged at his wrists. \"Why did they tie me down then?\"<br><br>\n\"I am afraid you have been rather violent towards the staff so far. We assume you mistook the healers for Romulans, given our shared physiological traits. Now that you are clearly lucid, I will of course advise Healer T'Lkai to free you from your bonds at once.\"<br><br>\nBefore Jim could reply, Spock had stepped away and called out in Vulcan. Moments later, a slender figure appeared in Jim's line of sight.<br><br>\nAnother Vulcan, black hair placed high on her head in an immaculate bun, looked down at him, face utterly neutral. Her skin was darker than Spock\u2019s, more like milky coffee, and she was wearing blue robes along with white gloves. Jim assumed that she had to be the one who had fetched Spock after he had not responded to her.<br><br>\n\"I shall free you from your restraints, <em>oveh</em>,\" she stated after offering the <em>ta\u2019al</em> in greeting, proving Jim correct when he recognized her voice. She spoke a brief Vulcan command towards something above Jim's head. With a beep and a loud click, Jim was suddenly released from his ties.<br><br>\nShakily, he tried to sit up, but his muscles and joints protested as he moved. All he managed was to edge upwards a bit, somewhat relieving the awkward angle of his neck.<br><br>\n\"Let me assist you.\"<br><br>\nBefore he could brace himself, T'Lkai had placed her gloved hands under his armpits and effortlessly lifted him up until he rested comfortably against the head of the biobed. Jim blinked. For a moment, he had forgotten not to underestimate a Vulcan's strength. No matter how slender their build, they would still be much stronger than even the best-trained human.<br><br>\nSwallowing roughly, Jim summoned what little Vulcan he remembered right now and said: \"<em>Cha't t'naat.</em>\"<br><br>\nT'Lkai looked at him for a long moment, then nodded once.<br><br>\n\"One does not thank logic, <em>oveh</em>,\" she said neutrally and, oddly enough, bowed briefly at him. She then nodded at Spock and left without another word.<br><br>\n\"I think I offended her,\" Jim said quietly, once the healer had left the room.<br><br>\n\"On the contrary,\" Spock replied calmly. \"I assume she was merely surprised you made the effort to speak Vulcan and used the formal, honorific form to express your gratitude.\"<br><br>\n\"Shouldn't I have? From what I gather, she's my doctor, right?\"<br><br>\n\"Among thirteen other healers, yes. Do not concern yourself, Mr. Kirk. You caused no offense to her.\"<br><br>\n\"She called me \u2026 what, <em>oveh</em>? I don't think I remember that word from Golic lessons. What does it mean?\"<br><br>\nSpock's eyebrows twitched very slightly. \"It means <em>honored one</em>. A title meant to show great respect for the person addressed.\"<br><br>\n\"Huh,\" Jim said, perplexed.<br><br>\n\"As I said, do not concern yourself. Surely, you must have more pressing questions at this moment.\"<br><br>\n\"Yes. How am I here? I mean, how did I \u2026 damn, what's wrong with my ear?\" Aware again of the numbness, Jim reached up to prod his left ear. Except there was nothing to touch. With a sinking feeling, Jim ran his fingers over the place where his ear shell should be. Instead of flexible cartilage, all he encountered was raised, hard skin, coarse hair and what had to be gauze dressing. Jim could not suppress a slight shriek. \"What <em>happened</em>?\"<br><br>\n\"You do not remember?\" Spock asked, stepping up to the bed and abandoning his stiff posture as he bowed closer in inquiry.<br><br>\n\"I \u2026\" Jim started, then stopped. His headache flared up with a vengeance. Suddenly, he felt sick. Very sick. \"I think \u2026 I think I'm going to throw up \u2026\"<br><br>\nSpock moved incredibly quickly. When Jim turned to the side and over the bed, a metal bowl was already waiting for him. He retched for several minutes. He spit nothing but bitter bile.<br><br>\n\"Sorry,\" he croaked miserably when the worst had passed, blinking down into the gross pan until Spock removed it from his sight. He was offered a small, grey washcloth instead. Jim shakily took it and ran it over his sticky mouth.<br><br>\n\"No offense where none is taken,\" Spock replied neutrally and removed the towel from Jim's hands once he was done. \"You are still ill, Mr. Kirk. It is only to be expected after what you have lived through.\"<br><br>\nRunning a trembling hand over his face, Jim shook his throbbing head. When he dropped his hand in his lap, he realized there was a small infusion device taped down on its back with no capsule attached. He didn't try to touch his deaf ear again.<br><br>\n\"So \u2026 somebody saved me?\" he finally ventured a guess when both the headache and his upset stomach seemed manageable again. \"From the <em>Narada</em>?\"<br><br>\n\"Affirmative. However, this is not a conversation to have quickly or lightly. If you are agreeable, I will call for the available healers. They will make sure you are fit for longer conversation and inform you of your current physical condition. If they find you to be strong enough, I shall explain to you everything that has transpired to the best of my knowledge.\"<br><br>\n\"But \u2026 hell, is everybody okay? Bones -- I mean, Dr. McCoy? Sulu? Uhura? What about the <em>Enterprise</em>?\"<br><br>\nSpock held up a hand.<br><br>\n\"All will be explained in due time,\" he said. \"Please be patient and let the healers assess your health first.\"<br><br>\n\"Can you at least tell me if everyone\u2019s alive? What about Pike?\"<br><br>\n\"All will be explained,\" Spock repeated and turned to leave, taking the soiled bowl and towel with him.<br><br>\nFrustrated and confused, Jim sank back against the head of the cot, feeling weak and awkward and horrible. His stomach still felt queasy. Hopefully, he wouldn't end up vomiting all over the Vulcan healers.<br><br>\nAs it turned out, Spock had not been inaccurate when he had called Healer T'Lkai one of many assigned to him. Shortly after Spock left, a group of no less than eight Vulcans of various ages entered, filling the room almost to full capacity. All of them were wearing light blue or green robes along with white gloves. They did not look like regular medical gloves.<br><br><em>Touch telepathy</em>, Jim remembered as he watched them form the <em>ta'al</em> with their hands. He quickly fumbled to return it, not sure if it ended up passable. His fingers felt a bit odd.<br><br>\nT'Lkai took her place on his right, next to the monitor.<br><br>\n\"We will aspire to speak Standard for your sake, <em>oveh</em>,\" she informed him briefly, before turning to the other Vulcans. \"Mr. Kirk woke approximately eighteen minutes ago. While he did not reply to my initial queries, he responded clearly and in a lucid fashion to the voice of S'chn T'gai Spock with whom he is more familiar. No violent outburst occurred. Mr. Kirk has since been freed from his ties and appears far less agitated than on previous occasions. Though his emotional control is still lacking, rational conversation is possible.\"<br><br>\nJim eyed the other healers, trying to gauge their reaction to T'Lkai's short speech. True to their Vulcan heritage, none of them showed so much as a frown.<br><br>\n\"Your vital signs have much improved. Are you feeling any pain, <em>oveh</em>?\" an elderly healer asked from his left. Jim awkwardly turned his head to catch it, given the lack of input from his left ear.<br><br>\n\"Bit of a headache,\" Jim informed him, voice still rough. \"Also, I just threw up. Um, sorry about that. And my left ear? I can't hear anything, and \u2026 well \u2026\" He gestured weakly at the side of his head.<br><br>\n\"Your left ear has suffered considerable damage. Your tympanic membrane has been forcefully pierced and the outer shell cut off completely. We have as of yet made little attempt to heal it, only prevented infection and additional damage. Restorative measures require the patient to be at least somewhat lucid.\"<br><br>\n\"But you <em>can</em> fix it, Healer \u2026 um \u2026?\" Jim trailed off awkwardly, realizing he did not know the elderly Vulcan's name.<br><br>\n\"You may call me Healer Serran, <em>oveh</em>,\" the Vulcan replied. Faintly, Jim remembered something about unpronounceable Vulcan names and Standard approximations. \"As for your query, the answer is yes. We can heal it, at least to some extent.\"<br><br>\n\"To some extent? What does that mean?\"<br><br>\nSerran\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he explained: \"Restoring the shell will be little work. We will extract a small amount of elastic cartilage from your body, then grow and form a new shell, which we will attach to your head after removing the scar tissue. However, the likelihood of restoring full hearing capacity is less than 1.8 percent. You arrived too late for us to properly mend the delicate membrane. Therefore, we will have to rely on a less effective technological aid.\"<br><br>\nSwallowing, Jim nodded. \"Okay. Anything else I should know about?\"<br><br>\n\"Nerve damage,\" another healer spoke up. With her straight hair chopped off sharply by her chin, she looked even more severe than most Vulcans Jim had seen in his life. \"We assume they are the results of torture through electrical charges. You may expect some level of loss in your fine motor skills. Both hands are affected. Though the exact ratio can not be determined yet, I estimate a decrease of sensation in your fingers by as much as 38.3 percent.\"<br><br>\nAnd on and on they went. Two right toes seemed to be missing, though the gray-haired healer at the foot of the bed seemed confident that they, too, could be regrown from other tissue and reattached. Thirty-two complex bone fractures, all mended. Malnutrition and insufficient weight, though also easily improved by proper nourishment and further infusions. Battered immune system, something to work on gradually. Damage to the heart and kidneys, already healing, but possibly requiring several weeks of supervision and medical assistance.<br><br>\nAnd of course, psychological repercussions: partial amnesia, heavy trauma, shock. Jim was told in very sober terms that he had in turn attacked his healers and pissed himself out of fright for the past fortnight. He knew his cheeks were burning by the end of the sober report.<br><br>\nWhen the healers had no more explanations or questions to offer, T'Lkai ran several tests with a scanner attached to the bed, checking the slim monitor by its side for results. Unlike the biobeds on the <em>Enterprise</em> and in the Academy sick bay, the Vulcan kind didn't make much noise. Jim couldn't even hear his own heartbeat echoed back at him.<br><br>\nT'Lkai's face, of course, gave nothing away as she studied the screen, tilting it so some of her colleagues could also have a look.<br><br>\nWhen the healers finally left him with a new infusion capsule attached to his hand, all of them bowed slightly or offered another <em>ta\u2019al</em> before they turned away from Jim's bed. Distracted, Jim managed another <em>thank you</em> in what was possibly very ill-pronounced Vulcan.<br><br>\nHis mind was whirling. Missing toes. A cut-off ear. Organ damage. Trauma. What a fucking nightmare. By the end of his medical lecture, Jim's headache had worsened considerably, though he had been too overwhelmed to ask for medication or even a glass of water for his sore throat.<br><br>\nLuckily, Spock returned almost as soon as the doctors had gone on their way. \"The healers inform me you are fit for further conversation,\" he said, face as expressionless as before.<br><br>\n\"Yeah, let's talk,\" Jim said. \"But can I have some water first, please?\"<br><br>\nThe slightest of frowns appeared on Spock's forehead, though it smoothed out again almost instantly. \"They did not offer any to you?\"<br><br>\nMutely, Jim shook his head. Spock stepped out again briefly, returning with a rectangular glass of clear water. Jim took it gratefully, forcing himself not to gulp it all down at once. He didn\u2019t want to throw up in front of Spock again. Instead, he savored the cool drink, letting the water run slowly over his tongue. It had an odd but not unpleasant earthy taste to it.<br><br>\n\"You must not think ill of our healers, Mr. Kirk,\" Spock said as he watched Jim drink with scrutinizing eyes. The attention was almost disconcerting. \"A highly superficial but effective mind meld is usually initiated between patient and healer upon hospitalization. Vulcan doctors also remove their gloves and consciously touch their patients during rounds to receive more information. It is considered less trying for the injured and an infinitely more accurate way to communicate about one's ailments. However, as you are human and cannot shield your mind from further intrusion, they neither melded with nor touched you and are therefore not completely informed of your needs. I will remind the staff of your special circumstances and recommend a more direct and vocal approach.\"<br><br>\nJim nodded thoughtfully. \"Couldn\u2019t they just have done it anyway? If it\u2019s just a brief touch, I probably wouldn\u2019t even have noticed.\"<br><br>\n\"Such violation of privacy would go against every Vulcan ethical code on telepathy we hold.\"<br><br>\nThough the tone of Spock\u2019s voice had hardly changed, Jim could not help but feel as if he had just been chided sharply.<br><br>\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said quickly, hands curling around the glass. His fingertips felt even more numb than usual. \"I didn't mean to imply anything.\"<br><br>\nSpock seemed to stand up straighter, although how that was supposed to be possible given his already perfect posture, Jim did not know.<br><br>\n\"Do not apologize,\" Spock said. \"<em>Oveh</em>.\"<br><br>\n\"You as well now? The healers kept calling me that, too,\" Jim pointed out with a tired smile. \"<em>Honored one</em>, right? Do you talk to all of your patients this way?\"<br><br>\n\"No,\" Spock said evenly. \"Only the ones who have made the choice to sacrifice their own life to rescue our planet and entire people.\"<br><br>\nJim's eyes moved down to the glass clutched in his hands. \"Oh,\" he said.<br><br>\n\"It is but a small way to convey our infinite gratitude. The Vulcan people are deeply in your debt, James Tiberius Kirk.\"<br><br>\nJim squirmed on the bed, watching the small pearls of liquid run through the thin tube of the infusion device. He suddenly felt incredibly uncomfortable.<br><br>\n\"It was my job as a member of Starfleet,\" he reminded Spock.<br><br>\n\"It was your duty to try and disengage the drilling platform to the best of your abilities. It was not your duty to go after the device containing the red matter. Neither was it your duty to ask to be beamed into open space without sufficient safety gear. Neither did you--\"<br><br>\n\"Please stop,\" Jim said, squeezing his eyes shut. He didn't want to hear it. Couldn't hear it. Not now.<br><br>\nSpock immediately fell silent. After a minute or so had passed, he continued with a much softer voice: \"I have upset you, <em>oveh</em>. I apologize.\"<br><br>\n\"It's fine,\" Jim managed. God, his head was killing him. \"Hey, you think you can get me something for my headache, too? It really hurts \u2026\"<br><br>\n\"Of course. As I said, I shall speak to the healers to ascertain a more direct approach to your needs in the future.\"<br><br>\nAgain, Spock left, only to return several minutes later with a carafe of water and a small pill.<br><br>\n\"We have been informed of your aversion to hyposprays,\" Spock told him as he gracefully filled up Jim's glass. \"This should for now be sufficient to your pain.\"<br><br>\n\"Bones told you that?\" Jim asked, accepting the medicine as it was dropped on his open palm. \"I mean, Dr. McCoy. Did he tell you about my allergies as well?\"<br><br>\n\"It was indeed Dr. Leonard McCoy who provided us with all relevant medical information,\" Spock said. \"He is well, too, to answer your earlier question. As are Lieutenant Uhura and Lieutenant Sulu.\"<br><br>\nSwallowing the pill, Jim grimaced as it seemed to rub against his sore throat.<br><br>\n\"Pike?\" he asked weakly, though he felt he already knew the answer.<br><br>\n\"I am sorry to inform you that Nero killed Captain Christopher Pike almost as soon as he captured you.\"<br><br>\nJim bit his lip. Harshly.<br><br>\n\"Shit,\" he finally said, his vision blurring. \"Shit shit shit. <em>Fucking bastard.</em>\" He swallowed. \"How many \u2026 how many altogether?\"<br><br>\n\"The battle resulted in the loss of 1.864 lives, including 45.3% of the senior cadet class.\"<br><br>\nJim had a hard time breathing just then. Nearly 2000 people dead. He\u2019d have to go through the lists, see whose funerals he had missed.<br><br>\n\"It might be of interest to you that Nero himself is also dead,\" Spock added when Jim said nothing further.<br><br>\nJim barked out a dry laugh. \"Of interest, yes,\" he spat. \"Fuck yes. Dead, really? Was it painful at least? Serves him fucking right if it was.\"<br><br>\n\"His death was clean and swift.\"<br><br>\nJim blinked against the moisture stinging in his eyes. \"Yeah?\" he asked roughly. \"How d'you know that?\"<br><br>\n\"It was I who ended his life,\" Spock replied evenly, looking straight at him.<br><br>\nBaffled, Jim stared at him, hoping for elaboration. None was forthcoming though, and Spock's expression gave nothing away. Jim could detect no remorse, no sign of Spock regretting his actions. Neither, however, did he seem satisfied about it.<br><br>\nOf course, Jim knew about the Vulcans' distaste for violence and their utter condemnation of murder. He had in fact never heard of a Vulcan killing anybody in cold blood.<br><br>\n\"Sorry you had to do that,\" Jim heard himself say before he could think better of it.<br><br>\n\"I am not.\"<br><br>\nJim blinked. For a Vulcan, that had to be a deeply private admission. He suddenly realized how intimate their conversation had been so far, especially given their rather short but colorful history. Taking another sip of water, Jim looked away again, grasping for a better topic.<br><br>\n\"Where are they now? Bones and the others, I mean.\"<br><br>\n\"They returned to Earth 6.8 Standard days ago. Starfleet requested their presence at the Academy. They had already stayed far longer on Vulcan than strictly necessary, but seemed rather anxious to see you in good health before returning home.\"<br><br>\n\"They helped rescue me?\"<br><br>\n\"Affirmative. It was a small but determined party, among them Lieutenants Uhura and Sulu as well as your friend Dr. McCoy.\"<br><br>\n\"Should call them then, probably. Thank them, tell them I'm still in one piece.\" Jim nearly laughed at himself. \"Well, mostly.\"<br><br>\n\"That can be arranged. Now, however, I advise you to try and sleep. Your hands are trembling and you seem very fatigued.\"<br><br>\nJim stared at his hands still curled around the glass. They were indeed shaking. \"Yeah, okay. Should probably rest.\"<br><br>\nHe let Spock take the glass, careful not to touch his skin. Awkwardly, he shifted on the bed until he was lying on his back again, adjusting the thin sheet serving as his cover.<br><br>\n\"I shall return when you are better rested, <em>oveh</em>,\" Spock said quietly.<br><br><em>Don\u2019t call me that</em>, Jim wanted to say, but felt too exhausted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nHe looked horrible, Jim concluded when he stared into the bathroom mirror.<br><br>\nThree days of strict bed rest, and the Vulcan healers had finally allowed him to get up and walk as far as the adjacent facilities and the window in his room. They had, however, asked him not to go for any extended walks. Seeing his own reflection, Jim could not entirely disagree with their order.<br><br>\nHe was thin, although not scarily underweight. His skin was very pale, which only emphasized the dark circles under his eyes. The patch on the left side of his head hid the scar where the ear was supposed to be. His feet looked weird, too, given the still missing toes.<br><br>\nAll in all, he appeared rather weak and brittle. He didn't feel much better, either. At least, he was assured that both his ear and toes were growing in some laboratory at this very moment and would be ready for reattachment by the end of the week.<br><br>\nSighing, Jim stepped into the sonic shower to finally clean himself without the help of the staff.<br><br>\nHe had soon realized that the Vulcans had gone out of their way to make him comfortable and assure his well-being. His room was a private medical suite, reserved for high-ranking Vulcans and honored guests. They had adjusted its room temperature to suit his Human needs, which undoubtedly meant they themselves were at least uncomfortable whenever they checked up on him. Which was very often.<br><br>\nJim was sure it had something to do with Spock, who had apparently been announced his official caretaker and showed no scruples about telling the Vulcan medical staff just how to properly accommodate a Human patient. At least, that was what Jim gathered from his constant presence and continued hovering.<br><br>\nHe was glad for the company, though. <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> debacle or no, Spock was the only person Jim kind of knew on this planet. Jim felt far more at ease with him than with the other Vulcans. Their continuous bowing and respectful nods made him feel very, very uncomfortable. At least with Spock, it was mostly <em>Mr. Kirk</em> and the occasional inclination of his head, though he would have preferred the Vulcan to call him Jim. Such an offer had been gently but firmly refused.<br><br>\nFeeling his knees go wobbly, Jim quickly finished up and left the shower. He felt unsatisfied. While sonic showers were highly efficient, they never gave Jim that feeling of having been cleaned properly. Water showers, however, were not available on a dry planet like Vulcan.<br><br>\nSlowly, Jim dressed in fresh clothes, one of the thin, knee-length tunics patients wore in Shi\u2019Khar hospital, and made his way back to his bed. As always, Spock was waiting for him. He was sitting on a chair he had procured the previous day, a PADD in his hands.<br><br>\n\"All is well?\" he asked, looking up briefly from the device as Jim sank back onto the bed.<br><br>\n\"I'm not a child, you know. I can go to the bathroom on my own, just like a proper grown-up,\" Jim told him a bit more grumpily than the question merited. Spock was merely taking his duties very seriously, as any Vulcan would. He probably didn't even know he was mothering Jim.<br><br>\n\"I did not mean to imply you had yet to reach age of maturity, Mr. Kirk,\" Spock said, as calm as ever.<br><br>\n\"Forget it,\" Jim sighed and rested his head on the pillow. \"It's just \u2026 I can't believe I'm still feeling this bad when I've been here already for over two weeks before I even woke up.\"<br><br>\n\"Your condition was severely life-threatening when you were retrieved from the <em>Narada</em>. It is only logical the recuperation phase would take much longer than you are accustomed to.\"<br><br>\nJim closed his eyes, silently cursing Vulcan logic.<br><br>\n\"Healer T'Lkai informed me that you are experiencing difficulties acquiring sufficient amounts of sleep,\" Spock added.<br><br>\n\"Did she now.\" Jim kept his eyes closed.<br><br>\n\"You are experiencing nightmares?\"<br><br>\n\"Yeah,\" he admitted quietly. \"It's all kind of blurry, though. Nothing specific. Just, you know, nightmare stuff.\"<br><br>\n\"I do not know, no. Vulcans do not dream and therefore do not experience nightmares.\"<br><br>\nSurprised, Jim turned onto his side to look at Spock. \"Really?\" he asked. \"No dreaming at all?\"<br><br>\n\"None,\" Spock confirmed, lowering the PADD after switching it off. \"We require little sleep and never enter into REM cycles like Humans do. Most of our energy is restored through meditation which often lasts less than three Standard hours.\"<br><br>\nJim nodded thoughtfully.<br><br>\n\"Wouldn't mind that myself,\" he said quietly. \"Getting rest without having to worry about dreaming.\"<br><br>\n\"You wish to learn the Vulcan way of meditation?\" Spock asked, lifting his eyebrows in a way that Jim had quickly figured out to mean surprise.<br><br>\n\"Well, not precisely. Can I, though?\" Jim replied, honestly curious.<br><br>\n\"It is not a state of mind unique to Vulcan physique, or at least not the shallow states of meditation. I doubt a deeper state like a healing trance would be accessible to you, but calming your mind and purging the most volatile of emotions should not be impossible. My mother, at least, has mastered it.\"<br><br>\n\"Wait,\" Jim asked. \"Your mother? She's Human?\"<br><br>\n\"Affirmative,\" Spock said. Was Jim imagining it, or was he moving a bit on his chair? \"My mother is indeed Terran.\"<br><br>\n\"Which makes you half-Human, right?\" Jim said, smiling. He propped himself up on his right arm, now free of any infusions, trying for a more comfortable position as they talked. \"No wonder they've made you my babysitter. They must think you the most fitting choice, given your mixed heritage.\"<br><br>\nSpock nodded stiffly. His eyes wandered, focusing on something behind Jim.<br><br>\n\"I believe that was part of their reasoning. Our previous acquaintance as well my staying on Earth and working amongst Humans must also have contributed to their logical conclusion.\"<br><br>\n\"Thanks, by the way,\" Jim said. \"I know you don't like me very much and staying with me all day must be boring, but I really do appreciate the company.\"<br><br>\nSpock's head snapped towards him at once. \"You have come to an erroneous conclusion,\" he said sharply.<br><br>\nJim almost flinched at the intensity of his voice. \"Um. Oh. I was just thinking \u2026 well, with the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> and everything that happened on the <em>Enterprise</em>--\"<br><br>\n\"I have misjudged your character severely in the past, <em>oveh</em>,\" Spock told him, putting special emphasis on the honorific. Jim swallowed. \"You are selfless and brave and very well understand the concept of making a difficult choice. You went after the red matter and asked to be beamed into space, thinking you would die. You had no logical reason to assume death would not be the outcome of your action. Yet, you decided to sacrifice yourself for the sake of many. You were willing to give your life for a planet to which you have no immediate connection. I, as do my people, recognize your extraordinary service to us. If I have given you the impression I find your company disagreeable, I sincerely apologize and shall endeavor to rectify my behavior in the future.\"<br><br>\nThat was quite a speech. Jim's cheeks felt very warm. Slowly, he turned back onto his back, staring at the ceiling.<br><br>\n\"You make me sound like some sort of hero,\" he said. \"I'm not, though. I was scared shitless when I jumped off the drill, I was scared shitless when I told you to beam me into space, I cried like a baby when Nero ...\"<br><br>\nHe trailed off, feeling his chest constrict. Talking about what happened on the <em>Narada</em> made him feel sick, and he didn't even remember all of it that well.<br><br>\n\"As you might remember, the point of the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> scenario was to experience fear in the certain face of death.\u201d Spock\u2019s voice sounded even more severe than before. \u201cIt is not a weakness to feel fear. It is a weakness to succumb to that fear, to let it guide your actions. You did not let your fear overwhelm you as you made your choice. Feeling fear does not make your sacrifice any less honorable. It only makes you Human.\"<br><br>\nTo his own horror, Jim suddenly felt like crying.<br><br>\n\"I wished I hadn't done it, you know?\" he confessed, feeling raw. \"When they were torturing me, at some point I kept thinking <em>Why did you do it? How stupid! You wouldn't be here if you hadn't!</em> I regretted it, do you understand? I wished I had never saved your damn planet! I wished your people would be dead so I could be alive and well. Do you understand me, Spock? I wanted Vulcan to be gone! Destroyed, all of it!\"<br><br>\nShaking, Jim turned his back to Spock, curling in on himself on the bed.<br><br>\nFor a few minutes, nobody moved or talked. Then, fingers curled lightly around Jim\u2019s thinly-clad shoulder. Spock still said nothing, but his hand felt soothing. They didn't talk until it was time for Jim's mid-day meal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nJim had never seen Bones cry in all the time he had known him.<br><br>\nHe knew, of course, that Bones was incredibly compassionate and emotional below the tough exterior, but seeing his friends' lips tremble as he stared at Jim from the screen with shiny eyes gave Jim the chills. A teary-eyed Leonard McCoy was definitely not something Jim wanted to encounter very often in his life.<br><br>\n\"Hey, I'm okay,\" Jim hurried to say as soon as the connection was stable enough for audio, trying to sound soothing and managing to have his voice go wonky halfway through.<br><br>\n\"Okay? <em>Okay?</em> Your damn left ear is gone! You're thin as a leaf, not a bit of color in your face! How does that remotely qualify as okay, huh?\" Bones barked, voice even rougher than usual.<br><br>\n\"Sorry,\" Jim said miserably at the screen.<br><br>\n\"You better be! You know how scared I was? We knew nothing, Jim, you understand? We didn't know where they'd beamed you, or if you were injured or even de<em>ad</em>.\" The way Bones' voice broke right there made Jim want to crawl into a very dark hole and never return.<br><br>\nThe doctor took a minute to collect himself, then continued in a quieter voice: \"Never do that again, you hear me? Never. This was your share of saving the world! One more stunt like this and I'll make you regret it. Got that, kid?\"<br><br>\nSwallowing heavily, Jim nodded at the screen. Somewhere near the door, Jim heard Spock shift and leave the room, probably disconcerted enough by so much emotional display to neglect his duties of keeping an eye on Jim at any given moment.<br><br>\n\"It wasn't just me, y'know?\" Bones continued. \"Everyone was worried, and they all worked their asses off to get you back. It's a damn miracle we weren't all court martialed to hell for the stunt we pulled.\"<br><br>\n\"I've heard,\" Jim said. \"Sorry.\"<br><br>\n\"Damn it, Jim, you were <em>soaked in blood</em> when we got to you. I didn't even know where to start fixing you up! For a minute, it looked like you'd die in my arms, after all we'd gone through!\"<br><br>\n\"Sorry,\" Jim repeated. Not sniffed. Not at all. \"And thanks. Really, thank you. To everyone.\"<br><br>\n\"Yeah, well,\" Bones replied, quickly wiping a hand over his eyes. \"Glad you\u2019re not. Dead, I mean. Just so you know.\"<br><br>\nThey stared at each other through the screen, clearly lost for words now that Jim had been suitably chastened.<br><br>\n\"Bones,\" Jim finally said helplessly.<br><br>\n\"Yes, kid?\"<br><br>\n\"Just \u2026 take care as long as I'm gone, yeah?\"<br><br>\n\"Always do, Jim. You, too. And I want a weekly update, you got that? Write to me, get your medical files from the Vulcans, too. Damn well need to know if they pull any of that Voodoo healing magic on you!\"<br><br>\n\"I'll ask Spock about it.\"<br><br>\n\"He treating you right?\" Bones asked, mouth twitching. \"No hard feelings over the <em>Maru</em>?\"<br><br>\n\"Nah, he's being really nice. Everyone is really nice. They take excellent care of me, really.\"<br><br>\n\"You did save their planet,\" Bones pointed out with a raised brow.<br><br>\n\"Yeah, well,\" Jim replied uneasily. He didn\u2019t want to get into that discussion again.<br><br>\nBones' eyes looked very knowing. \"Right. I'll have to leave now, kid, but you rest, you hear me? And if you don't write to me, I\u2019ll come to Vulcan myself to spank your sorry little ass!\"<br><br>\n\"Kinky,\" Jim joked weakly and laughed as Bones scowled and disconnected the call.<br><br>\nSpock stepped into the room almost as soon as the screen went blank. Apparently, he hadn't really walked off after all.<br><br>\n\"I see you are finished. I shall return you to your room at once.\"<br><br>\nWith a sigh, Jim carefully got up from the chair in front of the hospital communication panel and walked over to where Spock was waiting with a wheelchair of Vulcan design, all metal and acrylic glass. If Jim hadn't been trying to tone down on his emotional displays while staying on Vulcan, he would have grimaced at it in distaste.<br><br>\n\"You make a great nurse,\" he nonetheless quipped with a dose of sarcasm as he sat down in the chair and it bleeped, moving forward as Jim lay his finger over the appropriate sensor.<br><br>\nSpock didn't dignify that with a response, only guided Jim back to his room. Jim nodded at the Vulcans who inclined their heads at him as they passed. He caught murmurs of <em>oveh</em> with his good ear. It was still weird to be treated like some sort of national hero, but Jim was slowly getting used to the curious glances and respectful bows.<br><br>\n\"I have observed that you did not call your family, Mr. Kirk,\" Spock eventually spoke up, a careful sort of curiosity in his voice as he pushed Jim through a less busy hallway.<br><br>\nJim stiffened in his chair. \"Yeah I did.\"<br><br>\nSpock did not ask any more questions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\n\"Who took the red matter?\" Jim asked, surprising himself as the thought suddenly popped up out of the blue.<br><br>\nSpock looked up from the Tri-D Chess set placed on a small table hovering between the biobed and Spock's chair, tilting his head in inquiry.<br><br>\n\"Please elaborate.\"<br><br>\n\"After Nero beamed me aboard, he told his henchmen to get another capsule ready,\" Jim explained. \"But the ship carrying the matter was no longer there.\"<br><br>\n\"You know of that ship?\" Spock asked, eyebrows twitching.<br><br>\nJim grimaced. \"Nero did a lot of talking between the \u2026 well \u2026\"<br><br>\n\"I see,\" Spock replied slowly. \"Mr. Kirk, I fear there is something I have neglected to tell you.\"<br><br>\n\"Oh? Well, what is it?\"<br><br>\n\"It is not easily explained. Nor easily comprehended, I assume.\"<br><br>\n\"Try me.\"<br><br>\nSpock paused, averting his gaze. \"I would prefer for you to wait for an explanation for a while longer. At least until your toes and ear have been restored and you are allowed to leave the hospital.\"<br><br>\n\"You make it sound like a really big deal,\" Jim commented, wondering what could possibly be the reason for so much secrecy.<br><br>\n\"It is, I believe, what you would call a 'very big deal'. I would not wish to reset your recuperation due to further stress.\"<br><br>\n\"Well, now I'm just going to worry about it until they've fixed me up!\" Jim snorted.<br><br>\n\"I apologize,\" Spock said, and nothing more.<br><br>\nJim stared at him for a few moments, then let out a dry laugh. \"Fine, leave me hanging,\" he said, moving his knight in a bold move for Spock's queen, gratified that he was no longer dropping the pieces all over the place. He was slowly getting used to the decrease of sensation in his fingers.<br><br>\nSpock considered the chessboard silently with what Jim hoped was a look of irritation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br><em>I'm a wimp</em>, Jim realized as he watched T'Lkai place two hyposprays on the little table next to his bed. <em>One big fucking wimp.</em><br><br>\n\"You are distressed, <em>oveh</em>. You must calm down for my preparations to be fully effective.\"<br><br>\nDamn, and now he was projecting again.<br><br>\nSpock had informed him that most Vulcans could pick up on especially fierce emotions in their immediate surroundings, even when there wasn't a bond in place. It sounded much handier than it really was, given that Jim was prone to panic attacks whenever he saw pointed ears lurking in the shadow of a hallway and his brain started screaming <em>Romulan</em>, not Vulcan.<br><br>\nBy now, Jim was sure most of his healers had lost any awe they might have possessed for their precious <em>oveh</em>. T'Lkai alone had seen him burst into frightened tears no less than four times since he woke up lucid.<br><br>\n\"I'm sorry, <em>hassu</em> T'Lkai,\" Jim sighed, eyeing the hyposprays with dismay.<br><br>\nHe had started to implement more Vulcan in his speech. It seemed only polite to make an effort, and reminding himself of the respective titles and modes of address seemed a good place to start. Not that it counted for much when he still ended up angsting all over their telepathic minds.<br><br>\n\"Is there anything I can do to relieve you of your current emotional state?\"<br><br>\nJim was pretty sure T'Lkai had started to regard him like she would a Vulcan toddler, not yet able to fully control his emotions. It would even be kind of funny if there wasn't an operation looming over him. Meaning he had to be knocked out by several hypos, fall unconscious for at least two hours straight as he was stretched out on a table being cut and prodded at.<br><br>\nThe prospect of once more lying somewhere, unconscious and completely defenseless, was absolutely horrifying to him, if of course illogical. The Vulcans wouldn't harm him. On the contrary, T'Lkai and the others had gone out of their way to grow his new parts from tiny DNA samples in record time, quickly familiarizing themselves with the specifics of Human physiology in the process.<br><br>\n\"I don't think so,\" Jim said to the healer. \"I'll attempt to control it. I'm sorry it's affecting you.\"<br><br>\n\"I understand it is a natural state in Humans, <em>oveh</em>, succumbing to one's emotions and displaying them so openly.\"<br><br>\n\"It is. Still, I can understand it can't be very comfortable for you. Spock said you can pick up on it if it gets too bad. I wouldn't want to \u2026 um \u2026 upset your mental state.\"<br><br>\n\"My mental control is more than adequate protection, <em>oveh</em>.\" Now, she almost sounded insulted. Well, crap.<br><br>\n\"Yes. Of course, <em>hassu</em>. I didn\u2019t mean to imply the opposite.\"<br><br>\nHe should probably just shut up now. Shut up and take deep breaths, because his current heart rate was not healthy, let alone relaxed. The palms of his hands were clammy and moist and he could feel his legs tremble under the thin bed sheet.<br><br>\nMaybe, T'Lkai should just use one of those Vulcan nerve pinches. That way, she could at least do her job in peace and prepare him for surgery without Jim doing the mental equivalent of screaming his fear at her like a lunatic.<br><br>\nAs so often these days, it was Spock's arrival that eased Jim's volatile fright to a more manageable level. He did not quite understand why Spock was any different, but whenever Jim woke up from a nap convinced that Nero had once more gotten his hands on him, he was the one to get him out of it. Somehow, his messed-up mind had accepted that he was not a threat. A safe haven, even.<br><br>\n\"Do not feel guilt over your fear,\" Spock said as soon as he entered the room, greeting the busy T'Lkai with a swift <em>ta'al</em> before stepping up to the bed. \"Instead, try to calm your mind. Adhere to logic. Nobody here means you any harm. To feel scared is irrational.\"<br><br>\nIt was a strong sign that Jim had already spent too much time around Vulcans that he almost felt comforted instead of insulted by the way Spock dismissed his panic as an illogical anomaly.<br><br>\n\"I'm trying, Spock,\" he sighed. \"I really am.\"<br><br>\n\"Let me assist you by guiding you through the logical steps.\"<br><br>\nJim only nodded, listening to Spock list the many reasons why the impending surgery was no reason to run screaming, citing Surak\u2019s teachings as he deemed fit. It was indeed making him feel calmer. Maybe, he should take Spock up on that offer on instructing him in the Vulcan ways of meditation and pursuits of logic.<br><br>\n\"Something could still go wrong,\" he argued nonetheless when Spock finished his little speech. \u201cEspecially when they\u2019re trying to attach the nerve endings.\u201d<br><br>\n\"A surgery always comes with risks. However, in your case the benefits outweigh the risks by precisely 97%. Enduring the procedure and accepting that risk therefore is the only logical course of action.\"<br><br>\n\"Makes sense,\" Jim said. He still wasn't looking forward to surgery, but his heart had stopped trying to jump out through his throat and T'Lkai was already nodding at them in approval.<br><br>\n\"I commend you,\" she said. \"Mr. Kirk has now sufficiently calmed for me to administer the hyposprays.\"<br><br>\nBefore Jim could do anything about it, T'Lkai had placed the first at his neck and injected it. Jim winced, but otherwise stayed calm.<br><br>\n\"You will watch, right?\" he asked Spock, feeling kind of woozy as the pre-surgery mix of chemicals settled in his systems.<br><br>\n\"Although it is usually reserved for healers in training, I have received permission to watch the proceedings from the observation room,\" Spock said, inclining his head.<br><br>\nJim did not know why it made him feel better, but it did.<br><br>\nSoon, T\u2019Lkai was finished preparing him and he was moved to the surgery. Three more healers were waiting for him, already clad in what Jim assumed were surgical robes.<br><br>\n\"Do you wish to see your new parts before we administer the anesthetic?\" Healer Serran asked neutrally, face covered by a see-through surgical mask.<br><br>\n\"Sure, yes,\" Jim replied, though his eyes were on the windows up and across him, seeking out Spock\u2019s familiar form in the dimly lit observation room.<br><br>\n\"Growing them has proven no difficulty, just as we thought,\" the Vulcan told him, presenting him with a small transparent box.<br><br>\nJim turned his head and blinked at its contents, momentarily distracted from his anxiety as he looked at it. A small gasp of surprise escaped him.<br><br>\n\"It\u2019s... it\u2019s <em>pointed</em>,\" he said dumbly, staring at the ear.<br><br>\nHealer Serran nodded. His face stayed impassive, but spending so much time with Spock had given Jim a bit of a feeling for when Vulcans were not as relaxed as they wanted to appear. Clearly, the healer was not sure how this news would be received.<br><br>\n\"Indeed,\" he stated. \u201cDo you not think it appropriate, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d<br><br>\n\"No,\" Jim said, feeling slightly overwhelmed. Touched, almost. \"No, it\u2019s ... quite appropriate.\"<br><br>\nHe only threw a cursory glance at the toes in the other box, then rested his head on the surgery table. T\u2019Lkai approached with the last hypo and an oxygen mask. Jim sought out Spock again where he was sitting up straight on his bench in the observation room. More Vulcans were entering it now, undoubtedly curious to see something as rare as a surgery on a Human.<br><br>\nJim\u2019s eyes stayed with Spock until he blacked out.</p>\n<p>It was illogical to hurry, Spock knew. The healers had made it clear they would not release Kirk from the hospital until nightfall, mindful of his Human physiology and weakened state. It would not be wise to have him collapse in the burning heat of a Vulcan day. Therefore, Spock had timed his arrival precisely at sunset.<br><br>\nYet, Spock found his steps quickening as he left the transportation shuttle and approached the tall, well-lit building that was Shi\u2019Khar hospital.<br><br>\nIt had been five more days after the surgery before the healers had proclaimed Kirk fit to leave. He was still underweight and would need at least weekly check-ups until his heart and immune system were functioning normally again, but he no longer had to remain in bed.<br><br>\nStepping inside the hospital and approaching one of the turbolifts, Spock could not help but recall the look on the Human\u2019s face when he had told him that he was invited to stay at Spock\u2019s family home.<br><br>\nGrowing up with his Terran mother and staying at the Academy on Earth had of course acclimatized Spock to the way Human faces showed all kinds of emotional layers. The genuine surprise and joy Spock had easily read on Kirk\u2019s face had been quite illogical, however. Spock had made it very clear that he had been appointed the Human\u2019s caretaker as long as he resided on Vulcan. Therefore, he should not be surprised. Neither had Spock done anything to be the cause of happiness, merely fulfilled his duty as a Vulcan and Kirk\u2019s guide.<br><br>\nHowever, Spock had found that where Kirk was concerned, very little logical predictability applied.<br><br>\nWhen he had first seen the man, he was convinced that the cadet with the arrogant sneer on his face was egoistic, vain and therefore more than unfit for Command track, if not for Starfleet as a whole. Spock had not been able to understand the logic behind Captain Pike\u2019s choice to make Kirk temporary First Officer of the <em>Enterprise</em> or to trust him with a mission as vital as disengaging the drill threatening Vulcan, much for the same reasons.<br><br>\nThen, illogically, Kirk had done the unpredictable and not only disengaged the drill but jumped after the red matter device falling towards Vulcan.<br><br>\nSpock could not deny that in that very moment he had felt something: utter amazement, shock almost, at the selfless sacrifice of the very man Spock had considered one of the worst of his kind, a conceited, immature, self-centered Human.<br><br>\nHe could not have been more wrong. Kirk had done what no Vulcan could deem flawed: he had put the need of the many above the need of the one.<br><br>\nRegret, though, was illogical. <em>Kaiidth</em>.<br><br>\nWhen he entered Kirk\u2019s room, Spock was presented with such a brilliant smile that he was momentarily distracted by it.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock!\u201d the Human exclaimed in what could only be described as excessive exuberance. \u201cFinally!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI believe I am precisely on time, Mr. Kirk,\u201d Spock returned calmly, looking over Kirk who was sitting on the hospital bed.<br><br>\nHe observed that Kirk had made use of the offers of assistance by the healing staff and ordered clothes. While their cut was undoubtedly Terran -- long, straight pants with a short-sleeved shirt -- Spock recognized the sturdy and practical Vulcan fabrics easily. Somebody had gone out of their way to actually have those clothes sewn instead of simply replicating them in the Federation Standard polyblend. A small bag sitting on the floor by the bed indicated that he had received more than one set of clothing.<br><br>\nSpock was not surprised the staff had taken such diligent care of Kirk\u2019s wish. The Human was not yet aware of just how interested in his well-being the Vulcan people were. He had only gotten a glimpse from the way the healing staff acted towards him. Outside the hospital walls, Vulcans from all classes and origins had found it logical to trade information and news about Kirk\u2019s whereabouts and state of health.<br><br>\nIt was the closest Spock had ever seen his people come to admiring an outworlder\u2019s achievements in such a single-minded, almost emotional way. If he had interpreted some of the more subdued talk in Shi\u2019Khar correctly, even the Vulcan Elders were taking a pointed and unprecedented interest.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Hassu</em> T\u2019Lkai has officially released me,\u201d Kirk said, clearly making an effort to tone down on his smile as he got up from the bed and lifted the PADD Spock had provided him with from the table next to it. Being far from Earth, Kirk did not have any other personal belongings except for the bag of clothes.<br><br>\nIt had not escaped Spock's notice that Kirk was making an effort to accommodate his hosts. Spock had seen him look up Vulcan phrases and vocabulary, immerse himself in texts on Vulcan culture and casually drop perfectly passable Golic into his conversation with the staff. In addition, he was making a conscious effort to hide the most volatile of his emotions and was very aware of proximity and touch.<br><br>\nSpock\u2019s first assessment of James Tiberius Kirk as self-centered and uncaring proved less and less logical the longer he observed him.<br><br>\n\u201cThen I invite you to follow me to my home. It is in the outskirts of Shi\u2019Khar. A shuttle will bring us there in approximately 18.5 minutes.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAh, approximately,\u201d Kirk repeated, eyes crinkling in what Spock recognized as mirth.<br><br>\nOne thing he apparently could not reign in was the Human trait of <em>teasing</em>. But then, Spock\u2019s own mother had never been able to fully subdue that unfortunate activity either. Maybe it was a Human flaw too fundamental to their nature to disappear entirely.<br><br>\n\u201cYou are ready to depart?\u201d Spock asked.<br><br>\n\u201cMore than ready,\u201d Kirk replied with emphasis and stepped towards the door. He was obviously eager to leave behind the room he had both suffered and healed in.<br><br>\nKnowing it would be futile to point out the lack of logic in Kirk\u2019s phrasing, Spock simply lead the way.<br><br>\nAs soon as they stepped off the turbolift on ground level, Spock noticed the curious glances thrown in their direction. Pressing his lips together, Spock hurried up a bit, only to slow down again when he realized that in his current state, Kirk would not be able to keep up with that pace for long.<br><br>\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s <em>really</em> hot,\u201d Kirk said when they stepped outside the hospital and into the warmth of post-dusk Shi\u2019Khar.<br><br>\n\u201cA mere 38.7 degrees Celsius,\u201d Spock told him. \u201cThe sun has already passed the horizon. It gets much hotter during the day.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMuch hotter, really? What\u2019s the season?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI believe the Terran equivalent would be mid-spring.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh.\u201d Kirk looked distinctly unhappy.<br><br>\nSeeing Kirk\u2019s discomfort with the current temperature, Spock pointed towards one of the sleek, silver shuttles waiting by the street near the hospital. \u201cWe can climatize the shuttle for your convenience,\u201d he explained as he approached one of them, removed his credit chip from a pocket in his robes and pressed it against the sensor.<br><br>\nWith a few, swift movements he had programmed the correct route into the shuttle and opened the door for Kirk. When they had both entered the shuttle, its door closed tightly behind them.<br><br>\nKirk carefully watched Spock regulate the temperature inside the vehicle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to be cold.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI assure you, Vulcans can endure lesser temperatures than this without feeling any more than slight discomfort. Parts of our deserts fall well below -15 degrees Celsius at night. Unless we stay there completely unprotected for an extended period of time, we do not come to any serious harm.\u201d<br><br>\nFinding a free spot on the street busy with evening traffic, the shuttle moved forwards on its own. Spock watched Kirk dab at the sheen of sweat on his forehead, then turn his head and look at Shi\u2019Khar through the window. The new angle presented Spock with his left ear.<br><br>\nSpock had not expected the healers to grow a Vulcan ear, pointed and jutting out slightly. It could not have been an accident, as Human DNA did not usually carry these specific traits. When he had made enquiries of the nature with Healer Serran, he had told Spock that it had been a wish of the Elders to form the ear in this non-Human fashion.<br><br>\nAnother strong sign that Kirk was of particular interest to them. Spock had not yet collected enough data to come to a logical conclusion as to their full agenda, though he knew it was very unusual. He had yet to determine if he agreed with the current developments.<br><br>\nSpock had seen the look of reverence on Kirk\u2019s face as he had carefully touched the tip of his ear, looking at himself in the mirror T\u2019Lkai had provided. Spock doubted he was aware of how unprecedented it was, Vulcans purposely bestowing Vulcan traits on a non-Vulcan, but had said nothing. Kirk had not asked, either. He certainly did not seem displeased with his new appearance.<br><br>\nThey did not talk much on their way to Spock\u2019s family home. On occasions, Kirk asked about the purpose of a certain building or for the translation of a sign. Other than that, he seemed satisfied just watching the city pass by.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s very \u2026 orderly,\u201d he observed eventually. \u201cVery organized and clean.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cLogic and order go hand in hand,\u201d Spock reminded him, and Kirk nodded.<br><br>\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br><br>\nThe high buildings of central Shi\u2019Khar soon faded into lower buildings and houses, many of them partly or mostly built right into the red and brown rocks typical for Vulcan. Most of these were clan-houses, their foundations centuries old. With the streets emptier here, the shuttle sped up considerably, quickly approaching its programmed destination.<br><br>\nWhen they arrived at Spock\u2019s home, he could not help but observe Kirk carefully for his reaction.<br><br>\n\u201cThat is your house?\u201d Kirk asked, staring up at the building through the window, obviously impressed.<br><br>\nSpock could appreciate his awe. His clans\u2019 workmanship and architecture was indeed something to be admired for its efficient clean lines merging seamlessly with the more decorative styles of earlier centuries. Shortly past Reformation, architects had not yet ceased adding purposeless embellishments to housing.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he replied, opening the shuttle door. \u201cCome. It will be cooler inside.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock waited until Kirk had left the vehicle, then sent it off to the nearest station with a few simple touches to its sensors.<br><br>\nThey entered the house through the main door, stepping into the atrium. Kirk looked at the walls in open admiration, clearly interested in the inscriptions.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is old Vulcan scripture,\u201d Spock explained to him, placing his hands behind his back. \u201cSome essential teachings of Surak along with wise sayings of some of my ancestors. There is a family tree farther on the left, if you are interested.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Kirk said, turning to look at Spock. His eyes were very wide, showing off the curious tone of blue his genetics had bestowed upon him.<br><br>\n\u201cThere is a certain aesthetic to it, I agree.\u201d<br><br>\nBefore Kirk could reply, light and quick footfalls announced the arrival of Spock\u2019s mother. Sarek\u2019s steps would be much slower, more dignified.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, there you are!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHello, Mother.\u201d Spock offered her the <em>ta\u2019al</em> as she stepped closer.<br><br>\nStanding very straight, he endured his mother\u2019s brief touch to his cheek as she smiled up at him.<br><br>\nAs a child, he had not minded her physical way of showing her affection until he had realized that it was not the Vulcan way and frowned upon. She had since then ceased to kiss or hug him, though in more private surroundings she seldom refrained from touching his cheek with her two longest fingers in a modified form of a Vulcan kiss.<br><br>\n\u201cMother, let me present to you the honorable James Tiberius Kirk.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock watched her turn her smile on Kirk, who returned it instantly. Even though his face was gaunter than before, his smile had lost none of its easy Human charm.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good to meet you, Mr. Kirk,\u201d Amanda said with warm eyes, offering her hand for a shake in the Terran tradition.<br><br>\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. \u2026 ah, well, what is it they call you? Mrs. Sarek? Or is it Grayson still?\u201d Kirk replied. Spock did not miss the faint blush on his cheeks as he fumbled for the right form of address.<br><br>\n\u201cJust call me Amanda. You\u2019ll be staying here for a while, anything else would just be uncomfortable.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThank you. And please call me Jim.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cJim, of course.\u201d<br><br>\nThey continued smiling, clearly assessing each other with friendly looks. Even though he was used to the much more emotional Human greetings, Spock had to admit to a certain sense of discomfort as he watched his mother and Kirk being so familiar with each other.<br><br>\n\u201cI asked Spock to call me Jim, too,\u201d Kirk finally said, throwing Spock a pointed look. \u201cBut so far, he insists on <em>Mr. Kirk</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIf you desire, I shall endeavor to call you by your given name while we are in private,\u201d Spock replied stiffly when he saw the look his mother gave him. \u201cJim.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk turned that warm smile on him, then looked back at Spock\u2019s mother, who invited them both into the sitting room for some evening tea and fruit.<br><br>\nSpock mostly kept quiet as his mother and their guest chattered away about Terran things, talking about what Spock\u2019s mother missed most since moving to Vulcan and how to best deal with the different climate.<br><br>\nWhen a natural break occurred in their conversation, Spock smoothly interfered. \u201cWhere is father, Mother?\u201d he asked.<br><br>\n\u201cHe\u2019s with the High Council,\u201d she told him, raising her eyebrows in a way that Spock knew to mean that the meeting was of some significance. \u201cHe will return soon though, I imagine. He didn\u2019t seem to believe it would take much longer than a few hours.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda\u2019s assessment turned out to be correct. Sarek stepped into the sitting room 3.7 minutes later, wearing his most formal robes, usually reserved for highly important diplomatic occasions.<br><br>\nSpock stood at once, offering the <em>ta\u2019al</em>, and said formally: \u201c<em>Dif-tor heh smusma, osa-mekh.</em>\u201d<br><br>\nSarek returned the gesture briefly, then his eyes focused on their Human guest. Kirk, Spock observed, had also stood and abandoned the easy smile he had worn while talking to Spock\u2019s mother. Instead, he looked calm and severe as he offered a very passable <em>ta\u2019al</em> of his own and said: <em>\u201cDif-tor heh smusma, kevet-dutar.\u201d</em><br><br>\nKnowing his father well, Spock could tell Sarek had not expected Kirk\u2019s grasp on the Vulcan language to be quite this adequate.<br><br><em>\u201cDif-tor heh smusma, oveh,\u201d</em> Sarek replied. \u201c<em>La\u2019rom\u2019lasha.</em>\u201d<br><br>\nSpock shifted slightly, wondering if Kirk\u2019s knowledge of the language went quite that far, but he replied smoothly: \u201c<em>La\u2019ertau sochya t\u2019okelek.</em>\u201d<br><br>\nSpock did not miss his mother\u2019s smile from where she, too, had stood to greet her husband. It was clear Kirk faring so well using the Vulcan language pleased her.<br><br>\n\u201cYou are a welcome and honored guest,\u201d Sarek said, switching to Federation Standard. \u201cYour grasp on the Vulcan language is also to be commended, <em>oveh</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThere is much more to learn, <em>kevet-dutar</em>,\u201d Kirk replied formally.<br><br>\n\u201cThere always is,\u201d Sarek agreed, then turned to greet his wife.<br><br>\nSpock looked away as their fingers brushed together, instead focusing on Kirk once more. From the way he stared curiously at Spock\u2019s parents, it was clear the intimacy of the gesture was not entirely lost even on him.<br><br>\nThey settled down again, though the gathering felt more formal now that Spock\u2019s father had arrived. While Sarek did have ample experience dealing with Humans, it was clear Kirk was intimidated by his presence.<br><br>\nAmanda and Sarek exchanged a few quiet sentences, then Sarek turned to address Kirk directly again.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Oveh</em>, it is my honor to extend to you an invitation from the Elders of the High Council to join them for a traditional Vulcan mid-day meal in two days time.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk blinked several times, throwing a questioning glance towards Spock before settling for an answer. \u201cI would be honored to join them, of course.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cVery well, <em>oveh</em>. I shall inform them of your acceptance.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMay I ask for the purpose of that meeting, <em>osa-mekh</em>?\u201d Spock inquired carefully.<br><br>\nSarek\u2019s response for Spock stayed distinctly brusque: \u201cIt is between the honorable Mr. Kirk and the Elders.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI can\u2019t bring Spock?\u201d Kirk spoke up with another quick glance towards Spock.<br><br>\nSpock saw his father\u2019s eyebrows twitch. \u201cIt is, of course, your choice if you would like to bring a guest of honor, <em>oveh</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anyone,\u201d Kirk hurried to add, clearly sensing that it was not the done thing. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Spock has been really good about keeping me informed and, well ... out of trouble.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda laughed at that and some of tension in the room bled away.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear Spock has been taking good care of you,\u201d she said and Kirk smiled back in what seemed an almost automatic reaction.<br><br>\n\u201cI am convinced the honorable Elders have their reasons for keeping this meeting private\u201d, Spock stated. \u201cIt is only logical to adhere to their superior wisdom. I am certain you will fare tolerably on your own, Jim.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock felt his father\u2019s eyes on him when he uttered Kirk\u2019s first name. He had not missed the fact that Sarek kept using the honorific title and pronouns, talking to Kirk like he might to an esteemed equal or Elder.<br><br>\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Kirk said, inclining his head, though it was clear to everybody he was not convinced he would do well on his own.<br><br>\n\u201cYou must be tired, Jim,\u201d Spock\u2019s mother spoke up. It was obvious Sarek did not disapprove of her casual form of address. \u201cSpock, why don\u2019t you show him the guest room and where to find everything else.\u201d<br><br>\nIn other words, his mother wanted to speak to Sarek alone. Spock knew that Sarek would show much less discretion about the purpose of the meeting with his wife.<br><br>\n\u201cVery well, Mother,\u201d Spock said, standing up. \u201cIf you will follow me, Jim?\u201d<br></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nSpock startled out of his nightly meditation when panicked screaming sounded through the house. There was no doubt that it was Kirk, and Spock hurried to stand, straightening his robes with short, efficient movements before hurrying out of his room and towards Kirk\u2019s.<br><br>\nThe guest room\u2019s slide door was only partially-closed and the stone walls of older Vulcan houses carried sound very efficiently. Spock was sure the shouts could be heard throughout most of the building. As he entered the room, the screams turned so loud he had to quell an urge to press his hands to his ears and retreat again. Instead, he waved his hand before the sensor by the door to switch on the lights above.<br><br>\n\u201cMr. Kirk,\u201d he said loudly as he approached the bed.<br><br>\nThe man was thrashing. He had thrown off the thin knit blanket typical for Vulcan beds, exposing his bare chest. His sleeping attire was a single pair of dark pants, creased and slightly askew from his struggles. As Spock stepped closer, he could smell the distinct stench of Human urine.<br><br>\nThe healers had warned him of this. Yet, Spock could not deny that the sight of a soiled Kirk struggling in his sleep, shouting and lashing out in fear, was unsettling.<br><br>\n\u201cMr. Kirk,\u201d he repeated.<br><br>\nKirk kept screaming nonsense, his voice going hoarse the longer it went on. This close to him, Spock could feel his fear prickling at the edges of his mental shields. Clearly, trying to talk to him would be futile. Spock would have to shake him awake. Touch him.<br><br>\nBracing himself for the impact of such volatile emotions, Spock bowed down and firmly grabbed both of Kirk's bare shoulders.<br><br>\nThe sheer onslaught of emotions nearly brought Spock to his knees. He had calmed Kirk before, but never woken him from one of his nightmares through touch. Spock's mind was seized by a fear so instinctual, so fundamental, it shook him to the very core.<br><br>\n\u201cMr. Kirk,\u201d he managed through the mental assault, shaking the man once, twice.<br><br>\nKirk's eyes flew open. He gulped in air as if he had just emerged from water, gaze unfocused as he continued screaming. His hands came up to scratch at Spock's arms, clearly too confused and frightened to properly defend himself -- or realize that Spock was not any danger to him in the first place.<br><br>\n\u201cMr. Kirk,\u201d Spock repeated, grinding his teeth with the effort to control the emotional backlash. \u201cMr. Kirk. <em>Jim</em>. I mean you no harm. Please calm down.\u201d<br><br>\nFinally, Kirk's eyes seemed to focus and he ceased struggling against Spock's grip, hoarse screams turning into small gasps. Spock could feel some of the fear recede through their temporary connection, though it was clear Kirk was still incredibly scared.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock?\u201d he finally croaked.<br><br>\n\u201cYes. You had, I believe, another nightmare.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh. Yes,\u201d Kirk said. Having ceased the thrashing, he was now shaking and trembling with exhaustion. His hands, which had previously scratched at Spock's skin, were curled around his lower arms in what Spock assumed was a search of support.<br><br>\nHe was growing uncomfortable with the prolonged contact. Carefully, he let go of Kirk\u2019s shoulders, but the man only held on tighter to Spock\u2019s arms. With his violent movements, he had pushed the sleeves of Spock\u2019s robes up and past his elbows, which meant he was still touching Spock\u2019s skin directly. Waves of fear kept drumming against Spock\u2019s mental shields, shaking his control.<br><br>\n\u201cAre you capable of letting go of me?\u201d he asked as calmly as possible after a few moments had passed and Kirk made no move to remove his hands.<br><br>\nKirk nodded, though his fingers did not budge. Slowly but forcefully, Spock drew away until Kirk's fingers fell from his arms by themselves. The lack of direct contact was a relief and Spock took a few moments to close his eyes and reestablish his mental control.<br><br>\nWhen he looked back at Kirk, it was clear the man had realized that he had soiled the bed. His face had flushed deep red and he was staring down into his damp lap instead of meeting Spock\u2019s eyes. Even without a connection Spock knew he was feeling strong shame over wetting the bed.<br><br>\n\u201cYou must not be ashamed, Mr. Kirk,\u201d Spock said softly, bowing down to pick up the discarded blanket from the floor. \u201cYou are still recuperating from intensive trauma. I hypothesize that moving to a new and thus unfamiliar sleeping environment has upset your mind further. I advise you to use the adjacent facilities to clean up while I take care of your bed.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk only nodded mutely. He got up, not once looking Spock in the eye as he hurried away into the bathroom.<br><br>\nSpock efficiently stripped the bed and left to discard the dirtied sheets in the laundry and retrieve new bedding. On his way back, he encountered his mother in the hallway, wrapped in her Vulcan sleeping tunic and the Terran silk robe she favored in the mornings and late evenings. Her brown hair lay in messy waves around her head.<br><br>\n\u201cIs Jim okay?\u201d she asked at once, giving Spock\u2019s armful a surprised glance. Spock saw the very moment she understood the implications. Her face turned soft and affectionate, a look she often directed at Spock himself.<br><br>\n\u201cHe has calmed down now, although he was very upset before. He is suffering from intense nightmares.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo wonder, after all he\u2019s been through,\u201d she replied and fell into step beside Spock as he turned to return to the guest room.<br><br>\n\u201cI believe he is in need of mental counseling,\u201d Spock stated carefully.<br><br>\n\u201cHave you suggested that to him?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNot yet, though I am convinced the healers have made their own recommendations. He has also shown an interest in learning Vulcan meditation techniques. \u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou should teach him, Spock. It might help until he feels better or can return to Earth for proper therapy.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded. They had nearly reached Kirk\u2019s room. Stopping a few paces away, Spock lowered his voice.<br><br>\n\u201cI propose you return to your own room. While your worry is certainly appreciated, I am not sure Mr. Kirk would be comfortable with another person observing his current plight.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOf course, dear. Take care of him.\u201d<br><br>\nBefore Spock could prevent it, she had raised her hand and caressed his cheek with a warm thumb. As a child, Spock had always found his mother\u2019s warmer skin to be soothing.<br><br>\n\u201cSleep well, Mother,\u201d he said stiffly and accepted her fond smile with a nod.<br><br>\nStepping back into Kirk\u2019s room, Spock spotted the man standing by the door, dressed in a new pair of sleeping pants and clutching the other pair in his hands. His eyes were red and shiny, indicating that he had most likely cried after Spock left.<br><br>\n\u201cYou may put those by the door. I will show you the laundry room in the morning,\u201d Spock informed him and approached the bed.<br><br>\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Kirk said after placing his soiled pants by the door. \u201cReally. You shouldn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou are our guest as well as a recovering patient. Assisting you until you are recovered is logical.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd how is pissing the bed like a scared kid \u2018logical\u2019?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI take it your question is of a rhetorical kind, as I doubt I must explain to you the workings of mental stress and trauma on the Human psyche.\u201d<br><br>\nMaking sure Kirk had not soiled the mattress as well -- he had not -- Spock started to make up the bed once more. A sharp inhale from Kirk disturbed him and he looked up again.<br><br>\n\u201cI hurt you,\u201d Kirk said, pointing towards Spock\u2019s still exposed arms. His face showed genuine regret.<br><br>\nA glance downwards showed three scratches on either arm, all of them glistening slightly green in the light of the overhead lamps. Spock adjusted the sleeves with two precise tugs, concealing the injuries.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is of no consequence. They are hardly deep enough to waste the resources of a dermal regenerator.\u201d Folding and pressing the corners of the sheets in the Vulcan fashion, Spock finally draped a new knit blanket over the bed and straightened up. \u201cYou can now return to sleep. If you need any further assistance, do not hesitate to call upon me in my room. I take it you remember where it is located?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, of course. Thanks, Spock. Really. <em>Wa\u2019paitaren du</em>.\"<br><br>\nSpock inclined his head, unwilling to again remind Kirk of the illogic behind unnecessary gratitude. \u201cRest well.\u201d<br><br>\nPicking up Kirk\u2019s discarded sleepwear, Spock was almost out of the room when Kirk called him back.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, wait!\u201d<br><br>\nSpock turned. \u201cYes?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI ...\u201d Kirk cleared his throat, scrubbing a hand down his face. \u201cCould you ... I mean ...\u201d<br><br>\nWhen no comprehensible explanation was forthcoming, Spock tilted his head in inquiry: \u201cDo you require my help with anything?\u201d<br><br>\nAnew, Kirk\u2019s face turned red, though he did say: \u201cCan you \u2026 stay for a while? I\u2019d like to talk for a bit or, you know, do something. Get my mind off things. I don\u2019t think I can go back to sleep so soon after \u2026 this.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock stared at Kirk, taken aback by the request. Although Kirk had commented on how he found Spock\u2019s company pleasant before, Spock had not expected to be asked to stay as a supportive measure after something as private as a nightmare. Slowly, he nodded his consent. \u201cOf course. Let me return to the laundry room and I shall join you again afterwards. Would you like to play another game of chess?\u201d<br><br>\nKirk\u2019s small smile suited him much better than the mortified expression he had worn before. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that\u2019d be great.\u201d<br></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br><br>\nBreakfast was a quiet affair, although a Human might have described it as <em>awkward</em>.<br><br>\nAfter settling down with Spock and his parents for the morning meal, Kirk had apologized profusely for last night\u2019s disturbance, once more blushing Terran pink as he made his excuses.<br><br>\nBoth Sarek and Amanda had assured him that it was nothing to worry about, but from Kirk\u2019s repeated apologies and his following silence, it was clear he did not share that view. Spock watched him eat his morning dish with a distinct lack of his usual enthusiasm. He had not voiced any objections to Vulcan fare before, but seemed dissatisfied with his meal.<br><br>\n\u201cIs your <em>thas t\u2019kheh</em> not to your liking, Jim?\u201d he asked, nodding at the bowl of mashed grain. Spock\u2019s mother had always likened it to Terran porridge, but with a tart flavor to it.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s very good, thank you,\u201d Kirk replied at once. As if to prove it, he scooped up a much bigger portion than before with his glass <em>floku</em> and swallowed it quickly.<br><br>\n\u201cI always thought it tasted even better when adding some slices of <em>pla-savas</em>,\u201d Spock\u2019s mother added gently, pointing at the bowl of dark blue fruit in the middle of the table.<br><br>\nKirk politely declined, returning to silently looking at his dish, stirring the mash with his <em>floku</em>.<br><br>\nSpock did not miss the significant glance Amanda threw at him. It was clear she wanted him to change the mood Kirk was in. How he was supposed to do that, Spock did not know.<br><br>\nWhen Spock did not say anything, his mother shook her head and initiated further conversation herself: \u201cIs there anything you would like to see while you are staying on Vulcan, Jim? I\u2019m sure Spock would be very happy to show you around. It\u2019s usually quite bearable outside before the heat of noon.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone,\u201d Kirk said, smiling faintly as he set down his cutlery. \u201cI\u2019m sure Spock has something better to do than keep me company all day. He\u2019s already spent so much time at the hospital with me, it must be very tiring.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock tensed on his chair as he watched his father\u2019s eyes narrow at Kirk\u2019s words.<br><br>\n\u201cHas Spock given you the impression that he finds your company \u2018tiring\u2019, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d Sarek asked.<br><br>\nKirk glanced at Spock, but shook his head. \u201cNo, <em>kevet-dutar</em>, not at all. Spock\u2019s much too kind to say anything of the sort.\u201d<br><br>\nAlthough Spock was sure Kirk was trying to defend him, he could tell his father had interpreted the sentence quite differently.<br><br>\n\u201cI am available to you for as long as you like, Jim,\u201d Spock assured him, avoiding his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cAs I have told you before, Starfleet has granted me leave for as long as I deem it necessary. My current task is taking care of your needs as you recover on Vulcan.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Kirk said, placing his hands in his lap as he straightened on his chair. \u201cI\u2019m of course happy to meet with the Council tomorrow, but other than that, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much reason for me to stay. It\u2019s not Vulcan\u2019s responsibility to take care of me. I was injured during a Starfleet mission, so it should be Starfleet who fixes me up. I no longer have to stay in the hospital, so I\u2019m sure a nearby vessel can pick me up and transport me back to Earth for the rest of my recovery.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAre you not satisfied with your stay here on Vulcan, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d Sarek asked, eyebrows twitching. Spock had hardly seen him display this much irritation, but he knew it was not directed at Kirk.<br><br>\n\u201cNo! No, not at all,\u201d Kirk said, looking apologetic. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m very grateful for all that\u2019s been done for me. Your healers have done wonders, it\u2019s a miracle I\u2019m as functional as I am given the state I was in. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel like I should impose on your people anymore than is necessary. You\u2019ve already done more than your share.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is no imposition, <em>oveh</em>, to take care of the one who has rescued our planet,\u201d Sarek told him.<br><br>\nKirk cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you to say. But I already talked to Spock about that, and it\u2019s really not \u2026 I mean, I\u2019m very happy Vulcan was saved, but it wasn\u2019t just me and it\u2019s no reason to go out of your way to accommodate me.\u201d<br><br>\nHearing that, Sarek turned his head towards Spock. For a full Vulcan, his father looked positively thunderous. Spock\u2019s mother, years of experience making her as good a diplomate as her husband, picked up on it at once and hurriedly smiled at Kirk.<br><br>\n\u201cAre you done with that? If so, let me show you the gardens. I have managed to plant some Terran plants in Vulcan soil, would you like to see?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cUm, sure,\u201d Kirk said and stood with Amanda, throwing a glance a Spock and his father before he was led from the room, abandoning his meal.<br><br>\nSpock calmly lay down his own cutlery before facing his father. Switching to Vulcan, Sarek made no point in hiding his disapproval.<br><br>\n\u201cI must deduce from this conversation that you have given the honorable James Kirk the impression that he is unwelcome on Vulcan,\u201d he said sharply.<br><br>\n\u201cNegative,\u201d Spock replied. \u201cI have repeatedly stated that our people are honored to have him as our guest.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is clear that he does not know that. He even stated that a conversation with you ascertained his misguided point of view.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHe has voiced discomfort at being regarded as what he termed \u2018a hero\u2019. He is convinced he does not deserve any more praise than any other Starfleet member that was part of the rescue mission and seems to have drawn the erroneous conclusion that this also makes him unworthy of the extensive care offered to him on Vulcan. At no point have I agreed with his faulty logic.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is your duty as his current caregiver to make him understand that he is welcome and realize the regard of the Vulcan people. It is clear there must lie fault in your dealings with the honorable James Kirk for him to believe such illogical things to be true.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock stood, his chair scraping loudly against the floor. At once, Spock regretted the movement so close to an emotional outburst.<br><br>\n\u201cYou find me to be an inadequate caregiver to James Kirk?\u201d Spock asked, trying to keep his calm in face of such offense.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is the logical conclusion, given the misconceptions our esteemed guest is harboring,\u201d Sarek returned, also standing up, but in a much more dignified manner than Spock.<br><br>\n\u201cAre you certain you are not allowing your disapproval of my choice to reject my place in the Vulcan Science Academy to join Starfleet and reside on Earth among Mother\u2019s people cloud your judgement?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cUnlike you, I adhere to logic at all times. I have not strayed from the Vulcan way.\u201d<br><br>\nFor a moment, Spock felt like he could not breathe. Then, icy calm overtook him, a control so fierce any Vulcan would approve.<br><br>\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said and turned to leave the room.<br><br>\n\u201cNow you run from this conversation?\u201d his father called after him. \u201cAre you truly that unbalanced that you must flee?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock turned once more, facing his father: \u201cI am not running, nor am I lacking control. Rather, I see that our conversation has reached its logical conclusion. As you are convinced I have fallen from Surak\u2019s teachings and Vulcan logic, there is no merit in continuing this argument, as you will not deem my point of view valuable or even worth considering.\u201d<br><br>\nWith that, Spock left.</p>\n<p>For ten minutes, Jim listened quietly to Amanda talking about her various plants before interrupting her to say: \u201cDid I get Spock into trouble with Sarek?\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda straightened from where she had been inspecting one of her Terran cacti, glancing at Jim.<br><br>\n\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he pressed.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not your fault,\u201d Amanda sighed and nodded towards a stone bench standing in the shade by the house.<br><br>\nThey sat down and for the fifteenth time or so, Jim brushed a sheen of sweat off his forehead. How Amanda managed to keep her cool in this heat, all wrapped up in her headscarf and long dress, he honestly did not know. Even though it was still morning and supposedly cool for Vulcan standards, it had to be 30 degrees Celsius at least and Jim was feeling damp already. It didn\u2019t help that every movement was much more exhausting, given Vulcan gravity and the thinner atmosphere.<br><br>\n\u201cEven I could tell Sarek was angry with Spock after what I told him,\u201d Jim said, curling his fingers around the edge of the bench and feeling the sharp Vulcan stone cut lightly into his skin. It felt good, given the decreased sensation in his hands.<br><br>\n\u201cThings have been tense for a while between them,\u201d Amanda sighed. \u201cHonestly, you could probably have lauded Spock for hours and my dear husband would still find a flaw in our son\u2019s behavior.\u201d<br><br>\nJim frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, then caught himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s really not any of my business--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Amanda interrupted, smiling at him. \u201cYou live with us and have to endure their childish behavior, so you deserve an explanation. It all comes down to them being stubborn Vulcans, completely unable to tell each other how they really feel.\u201d<br><br>\nJim snorted. \u201cYeah, well, I didn\u2019t think Vulcans and emotions went together so great.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cVulcans strive to control their emotions, but really, they feel much more strongly than we do, much more intensely,\u201c Amanda explained, her voice laced with obvious fondness. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve shared my mind with one for over three decades. They do feel, but they will their emotions down in the pursuit of pure logic.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound too healthy.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda laughed. \u201cNot to us Humans, no. They cope well, though, in general. They\u2019ve had centuries of practice and Surak\u2019s teachings to guide them. Vulcan society has prospered through their control, but sometimes, it really makes it difficult for them to communicate. There is a difference between controlling your emotions and suppressing them. And in the end, logic cannot solve all.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Spock you said that,\u201d Jim joked, but Amanda\u2019s face was serious.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock knows this, deep down, but he ignores it. As does my husband. Did you know Spock was accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy after he\u2019d finished his schooling?\u201d<br><br>\nJim shook his head, shrugging awkwardly. \u201cTo be honest, we had only known each other for a few hours before \u2026 well, before Nero and all that.\u201d Though he really wished they had met earlier these days. Spock was -- well, really something. Jim had been trying to ignore the butterflies he was feeling lately during their chess games.<br><br>\n\u201cReally? It\u2019s hard to imagine, seeing how much he cares for you now.\u201d Jim opened his mouth to protest, but Amanda had already moved on. \u201cEither way, Spock refused the Academy and left for Earth to join Starfleet soon after. Sarek was not pleased. It was the first time any Vulcan has refused admittance, you have to realize.\u201d<br><br>\nA grin spread slowly on Jim\u2019s face. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have taken Spock for a rebel. Good for him, though. Starfleet is head over heels for him, from what I hear.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda smiled back. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was easy for him, leaving Vulcan, but he did seem happy once he settled down and made friends.\u201d Her smile faded and she sighed, looking away and out into the small, rocky garden. \u201cSarek isn\u2019t blind. He can see how good Earth has been for Spock, but he cannot acknowledge it. For him, the logical choice for Spock would have been to accept his place at the Science Academy and live an entirely Vulcan life instead of going to explore the universe and his Human side.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ll make up any time soon?\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to make amends, to get them to talk, but it never ends well. Spock feels rejected and misunderstood, and the frustration Sarek tries to push aside after one of their talks gives me a splitting headache right through our bound, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d<br><br>\nThe last part sounded a lot like a trademark Bonesian grumble, and Jim couldn\u2019t help but smile.<br><br>\nHe felt a swell of admiration for this woman. It was clear she was intelligent, brave enough to leave her planet behind to live on another, adapt to a life completely different to what she had known. And now, she tried to help her son navigate his path between two worlds, make amends between her Vulcan husband and half-Human child.<br><br>\nActing on instinct, he reached out for her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay. They can\u2019t keep arguing forever, can they?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou clearly don\u2019t know much about Vulcans and their grudges,\u201d she told him, but her fingers curled briefly around Jim\u2019s in response and she smiled at him, eyes crinkling kindly.<br><br>\n\u201cI take it you and Jim have finished your tour of the gardens?\u201d<br><br>\nJim nearly jumped off the bench in surprise. Blinking upwards, he saw Spock narrowing his eyes at their joined hands. Jim quickly let go of Amanda\u2019s fingers, suddenly feeling embarrassed. The gesture, while certainly affectionate among Humans, had to look utterly intimate to a Vulcan. Jim didn\u2019t want Spock to think he was -- what, hitting on his mom? Damn.<br><br>\n\u201cJim\u2019s been kind enough to listen to my endless chatter on various cacti,\u201d Amanda confirmed with an easy smile.<br><br>\n\u201cYou are well versed in Terran cactoid plant life and how it fares on Vulcan. I am sure Jim appreciated sharing your unique and rather extensive botanic knowledge.\u201d The look Spock threw him dared him to say otherwise.<br><br><em>Bit of a mama\u2019s boy,</em> Jim thought with a surge of amusement and fondness. Seeing Spock interact with his mother had been a revelation. While he was pretending to be unaffected, Jim had seen the affectionate little glances and touches he usually offered in return. It was endearing in a way that Jim tried not to think about too much.<br><br>\nHe hurried to nod at Spock, covering an escaping laugh with a little cough.<br><br>\n\u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d Spock asked immediately and Jim felt bad for making him worry -- again. Spock was taking his caretaker duties very serious.<br><br>\n\u201cJust a dry throat,\u201d Jim said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot outside. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to any sightseeing in this heat, to be honest.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThen it would be best to retire inside. If you are amenable, I can show you some of the Vulcan relaxation techniques I have mentioned to you before.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSounds great.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWill you join us, Mother?\u201d Spock asked, arms tucked behind his back as Amanda stood from the bench.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d They started to walk back towards the house. \u201cYou boys have fun.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou know we are both considered mature adults in our respective cultures, mother,\u201d Spock chastised her lightly. \u201cFurthermore, Jim and I will aspire to clear his mind, not seek pointless amusement from it.\u201d<br><br><em>Hopeless</em>, Amanda mouthed at Jim as they entered the house and winked at him when Spock had his back turned to them. Jim had to bite his lip not to burst into undignified giggles</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br><br>\n\"Like this?\" Jim asked as he adjusted his feet yet again.<br><br>\n\"It is sufficient,\" Spock told him. Jim heard the <em>barely adequate</em> without it being spoken out loud. Lucky for him, Spock seemed to be a rather patient teacher.<br><br>\n\"How can I manage to clear my mind when I can't even get my feet to stick to each other?\" One of his joints popped audibly as he adjusted his legs.<br><br>\n\u201cI fail to understand how such a simple position can cause such difficulty for you.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m still recovering. Give me a break!\u201d Jim joked defensively, and immediately regretted it. He should know better by now. For some reason, Spock was unable to see Jim\u2019s health as any sort of joking matter. The only other person who had ever been so particular about it was Bones.<br><br>\n\u201cYour former injuries are troubling you again?\u201d Spock asked at once, leaning closer with assessing eyes. \u201cShall I call for a healer?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, I was just teasing.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock\u2019s frown was very noticeable just then. \u201cPlease refrain from \u2018joking\u2019 or \u2018teasing\u2019 about your state of health. It is not something to take lightly.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jim sighed.<br><br>\n\u201cInstead of apologizing, I would prefer you aspire to change your behavior. It is illogical to voice regret over actions one plans to repeat in the future.\u201d<br><br>\nOuch. Maybe, Amanda had been right when she had pointed out that Spock cared a lot more than strictly expected, though Jim doubted he was feeling any of the warm tingles Jim had been experiencing for a while.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he promised seriously.<br><br>\nSpock nodded. After lighting a small amount of spicy Vulcan incense, he gracefully slid into the position Jim had struggled to achieve. He didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble sticking the soles of his feet together while placing his knees on the floor. He rested his hands, palms facing downwards, on his ankles. His back was perfectly straight.<br><br>\n\u201cThis is <em>loshirak</em>, the open posture,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is the simplest of all meditation postures, taught to Vulcan children as soon as they are capable of controlling their limbs for an extended amount of time.\u201d<br><br>\nSo kids could do this better than him. Fantastic. Suppressing a sigh, Jim forced his knees vaguely towards the ground and placed his hands on his ankles like Spock, hoping his feet wouldn\u2019t slip again.<br><br>\n\u201cNow you will aspire to master the <em>tu-lan</em>, our method of meditative breathing. It is the first step towards achieving <em>tvi-sochya</em>. A rough translation would be \u2018inner peace\u2019.\u201d<br><br>\nFor the next half hour, that was all they did -- breathe. As the first twenty minutes or so passed, Jim felt incredibly awkward as he let warm air flow through his nose, silently counting to ten for each cycle. He knew this was supposed to clear his mind, but really, all it did for him seemed to be making him brood more.<br><br>\nHe kept losing count, and when he wasn\u2019t thinking about how hopeless he was at this, his mind flashed back to his time at Shi\u2019Khar hospital, the tense minutes spent fighting on Nero\u2019s drilling platform, the look on Spock\u2019s face when he had woken him from his nightmare ...<br><br>\nEventually, though, he could feel a difference. Slowly, his mind seemed to calm down and an intense sort of quiet washed over him. It almost felt like falling asleep, except he was more aware of his own heartbeat, the tension of his muscles, his fingers curled loosely around his ankles.<br><br>\nIt did not last long, a mere thirty seconds or so, before he felt his feet slip. He let out a small curse as he lost his balance, slumping where he sat on the soft meditation mat Spock had lent him.<br><br>\nWhen he looked up, Spock was looking at him with raised eyebrows, posture still perfect.<br><br>\n\u201cIt worked -- for, like, a few moments,\u201d Jim told him.<br><br>\n\u201cPlease elaborate.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI felt, um, really calm. Relaxed, but I was kind of focusing on my heartbeat and my muscles, too. Kind of a -- focused floating?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is a beginning,\u201d Spock said after brief contemplation, gracefully uncurling from his position and standing up. \u201cI advise you to exercise <em>tu-lan</em> twice daily until you master it. Once you can achieve that state of what you call \u2018focused floating\u2019 for at least thirty minutes, we can move on to the next technique.\u201d<br><br>\nJim blinked up to him from his mat. \u201cAnd you really believe this will help with the nightmares?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAs I have never experienced a nightmare, I cannot say for certain. However, it is clear to me that your mind is deeply troubled and you are quite upset by the past events. It appears logical to assume that disciplining the mind will ease the chaos created by trauma and help you settle in the night.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s worth a try at any rate,\u201d Jim said, rearranging his feet to the posture he had been shown. With the heat outside steadily increasing, it wasn\u2019t like he had anything better to do. If only he weren\u2019t so sweaty all the time, maybe his feet would stick together after all.<br><br>\n\u201cIt certainly is. As you are clearly preparing for another attempt, I shall leave you to meditate in peace. As always, you may call on me in my room if you require anything at all.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThanks, Spock,\u201d Jim said, smiling up at him before closing his eyes and focusing on his breathing.<br><br>\nHe could practically hear Spock\u2019s distaste over his thanking him again. <em>Illogical as it might be,</em> Jim thought as he settled into the breathing pattern, <em>it\u2019s just one of those things he will have to get used to.</em><br><br>\nHe did not achieve the floating sensation again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nThe timing was fucking perfect, bordering on unbelievable really, but Jim was not one to question his luck. His arms curled firmly around the capsule and he felt the metal casing grind harshly against his ribcage, and then, he was plummeting fast towards the red planet underneath.<br><br>\nHe held on to the missile as if his life depended on it, trying to calculate the risk of using one arm to pull his chute. He was sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to grab the thing again once he lost it.<br><br><em>Enterprise to Kirk, what ez happening? Why did you jump off ze drill?</em><br><br>\nThe wind was whipping harshly past Jim as he raced straight towards the ground, making it even harder for him to understand the Russian than it was in the first place.<br><br>\n\u201cThey launched something toward the planet!\u201d Jim replied urgently, very much out of breath and trying hard not to panic. Which, seeing as he was currently free-falling towards the planet\u2019s surface at mind-numbing speed, was pretty fucking impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is exactly, but if they\u2019re throwing it into the hole they drilled, it\u2019s likely some sort of bomb.\u201d<br><br><em>What? You will fall into ze hole along with ze missile!</em> the kid reminded him, leaving communications protocol behind in favor of freaking out at him. Fucking fantastic.<br><br>\n\u201cPulling my chute now,\u201d Kirk informed him and finally dared loosening his grip to activate the rip line.<br><br>\nIt was a fucking miracle the sudden lurch didn\u2019t make him lose his grip on the device or killed the chute, but he still had the thing and it hadn\u2019t exploded yet and Jim took a huge breath as his descend was slowed.<br><br>\nStill, the thing was heavy as fuck, pulling him down at a much greater speed than usual. Also, his damn arms were hurting and he was sure he might have cracked a rib or two with this stunt if the pain in his chest was anything to go by. They would have to beam him up fast.<br><br>\n\u201cDid you get Sulu off the drill yet?\u201d he shouted towards the small, mobile comm attached to his ear.<br><br><em>Yes, yes, he ez in ze transporter room.</em><br><br>\nIt hit Jim then that he wasn\u2019t wearing his helmet. Really, he had no protective gear beside the suit he was wearing and the chute on his back, straining under the weight of both Jim and the bomb.<br><br>\nHowever, there was no fucking way he\u2019d let them beam him onto the <em>Enterprise</em>, not with an unpredictable demolition device in tow.<br><br>\nJim stared down at the red ground of Vulcan coming closer and closer.<br><br>\nSwallowing, he realized that this was it. There was no way he could get the bomb off Vulcan and himself safely back onto the ship without risking the lives of hundreds of people. It was either he left the bomb and see it disappear into the hole, leaving no chance for the <em>Enterprise</em> to lock onto it, or he went right into space with it.<br><br>\nJim had to fight a bout of hysterical laughter. Maybe, Spock had been right about the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em>: there were no-win scenarios after all.<br><br>\n\u201cListen up, <em>Enterprise</em>,\u201d Jim gasped against the whipping wind. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this thing is, but I have two minutes tops until I\u2019m going to be past the hole and too far in for you to tag me, so you\u2019ve got to beam me up and into space as soon as possible.\u201d<br><br><em>What?</em><br><br>\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Kirk repeated through clenched teeth. To make things worse, the wind suddenly changed and the chute lurched again, shaking him badly. <em>Fuck.</em> He prayed to whatever damn deity out there that the fucking missile would hold out on him until he was off-planet.<br><br>\n\u201cBeam me site-to-site, right into space, <em>Enterprise</em>, as far away as you can get me. We don\u2019t know when this fucking thing will go off, but I\u2019d rather it wasn\u2019t this close to Vulcan!\u201d<br><br>\nA lengthy pause. Then, Jim heard Commander Spock\u2019s voice, calm and measured. <em>You realize the risks of such an endeavour?</em><br><br>\nJim felt heated anger bubbling in his stomach. Did Spock really think him that stupid?<br><br>\n\u201cOf course I fucking do,\u201d he shouted, wondering faintly if his anger didn\u2019t simply make him sound more fearful. \u201cI\u2019ve got no helmet, no oxygen, no nothing. My eyeballs\u2019ll be bleeding.\u201d And now he sounded like Bones.<br><br>\nAnd, oh God, but Bones. Jim would never see him again. Never sit at the ocean at night drinking bourbon, or sneak into his dorm room at two am because he felt lonely, or listen to him bitch about Jocelyn, and Jim better not get married, ever.<br><br><em>Your chances of survival are less than point one percent</em>, Spock continued, sounding as unfazed as only a Vulcan could. <em>It is highly unlikely we will be able to reenergize and beam you aboard quickly enough to avoid permanent damage to your person. Doing this will almost certainly result in your death.</em><br><br>\n\u201cI fucking know, just fucking do it!\u201d Jim bellowed, squeezing his eyes shut against the coils of emotion in his chest, the adrenaline spiking through his body. His voice sounded raw. \u201cYou need to beam me up now, Spock, or you might as well watch me and the fucking bomb collide with your home planet! I doubt that\u2019s gonna be pretty!\u201d<br><br>\nMore silence, and for a second, Jim actually believed Spock was going to order him to let go of the capsule and let himself be beamed aboard safely.<br><br><em>Ensign Chekov,</em> Spock\u2019s voice finally returned. <em>Prepare to beam Mr. Kirk directly into space, site-to-site transport.</em><br><br>\n\u201cJesus, fucking finally,\u201d Jim whispered, eyes closed, waiting for the familiar tingle of the transporter beam to fetch him.<br><br>\nBut it didn\u2019t, it fucking didn\u2019t, and Jim kept plummeting downwards, still clutching the bomb.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Enterprise</em>, what is going on?\u201d he screamed, but his left ear was filled with nothing but static, and the red sands of Vulcan came closer, so much closer and so quickly and--<br><br>\nThe next thing Jim knew, he was sitting up in bed, drenched in sweat and breathing heavily. He was clutching his newly pointed ear as if the mobile comm was still attached, but the buzzing was gone. It took him a few moments to calm down enough to realize that no, he wasn\u2019t falling towards Vulcan but residing on it.<br><br>\nJim allowed himself a few quiet sobs before forcing himself to breathe evenly.<br><br>\nAt least, he hadn\u2019t pissed the bed again. Neither had Spock come running like a worried mother hen. Most likely, Jim hadn\u2019t screamed the house down this time.<br><br>\nFeeling shaky, Jim fell back against his pillow, kicking off the knit blanket resting on his legs in a tangled mess. Fuck, but he was so screwed up. At least this time, it hadn\u2019t been Nero cutting off his toes and ear with grotesque, giant scissors, all the while telling him what a worthless little shit he was in a voice that sounded like Frank\u2019s.<br><br>\nAs nightmares went, this one had actually been frighteningly realistic, except for the ending. Maybe, the Vulcan breathing thing was already working, forcing him to deal with what actually happened instead of making up fucked-up dreams for all the shit he couldn\u2019t remember from the <em>Narada</em>.<br><br>\nBut why was he dreaming about screwing up the mission completely then? What the hell was going on with him?<br><br>\nFeeling hot and sticky, Jim stood and moved into the bathroom. At this rate, he\u2019d use the sonic three times a day. The heat on Vulcan was killing him, and covering himself in fright sweat during the cooler nights did the rest.<br><br>\nAvoiding looking into the mirror, Jim entered the shower, hit the right button and closed his eyes as he was cleaned quickly and efficiently.<br><br>\nHe\u2019d have to get better soon, but first of all, he had to leave. No matter what Spock and his parents said, he could tell when he was being a nuisance. What he needed was a nice set of psychotropic drugs and 0-degree-weather. Surely, Starfleet could provide him with both. Send him off to recover on some snow-covered planet until he was functional again.<br><br>\nIf Jim really was this much of a wreck, it definitely wasn\u2019t Vulcan\u2019s job to take care of it, that much was sure.<br><br>\nHissing in anger, Jim hit the off-button with more force than necessary and left the shower. He\u2019d have lunch with the Elders and then leave.<br><br>\nThat was his plan, and he\u2019d stick to it</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cWhat do you mean, leave Vulcan? They trying to get rid of you already?\u201d<br><br>\nJim shrugged as Bones squinted at him from the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve been here long enough\u201d, he said vaguely.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even been a full month,\u201d Bones argued. \u201cMost of which you spent in the hospital throwing a fit whenever somebody went anywhere near you. It\u2019s a damn miracle you\u2019re walking around already. You know what kind of state we found you in.\u201d<br><br>\nJim scowled, letting out an exasperated sigh. \u201cWill you help me or not?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI\u2019d rather not contact the brass directly. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m not still suspended because of the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nBones snorted. \u201cPlease. You think they can afford kicking out the guy that saved Vulcan? Starfleet can be stupid, but they\u2019re not likely to admit that they had planned on leaving you on Earth when Nero attacked. For all I know they\u2019ve already made up some bullshit excuse about \u2018inventive thinking\u2019 or something to get you off the charges. Plus, I\u2019m fairly sure you\u2019ll be keeping your field promotion too once you\u2019ve finished debriefing for Vulcan and Nero. We all did.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cStill,\u201d Jim pressed, ignoring the queasy feeling in his stomach. \u201cI\u2019d rather you organize this, Bones. Please?\u201d<br><br>\nBones tilted his head.<br><br>\n\u201cLook, kid, I\u2019m the first to tell you that Vulcans can be exhausting, what with being emotionally stunted and all that, but you\u2019re in no state to travel. I can tell even from this shaky vid comm that you\u2019re still weak and the files they sent me clearly state you need ongoing medical surveillance for your heart and renutrition. The stress alone would set you back weeks. Why don\u2019t you give it some more time? You\u2019re not missing anything here, Jim. Graduation is still a month off and it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t take your finals when you\u2019re back. They\u2019re making exceptions for all of us already, one more won\u2019t make much of a difference.\u201d<br><br>\nFrustrated, Jim scowled at the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about graduation, Bones,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI just want to leave, okay?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo need to be cranky with me,\u201d Bones snapped right back, then his voice softened. \u201cTalk to me, Jim. What\u2019s the real problem here? You said they\u2019re treating you well. Hell, they love you so much they plastered a Vulcan ear to you head, so what is it?\u201d<br><br>\nSuddenly feeling incredibly weary, Jim rubbed a hand over his face. It came away sticky with sweat. God, the heat was unbearable.<br><br>\n\u201cI just want to leave,\u201d he repeated helplessly. \u201cPlease, Bones? I\u2019d owe you big time.\u201d<br><br>\nProbably tired of Jim\u2019s whining, Bones sighed his consent. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll see what I can do. But I\u2019m not promising anything, okay? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve realized, but the brass don\u2019t take kindly to a group of senior cadets stealing a Starfleet shuttle to go on a haywire rescue mission with their Vulcan instructor. I\u2019m not exactly on their nice list at the moment, special commendation or no.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, I get it. Thanks, Bones, really. You\u2019re the best.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, kid. Just get better soon, you hear me?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201c\u2018kay,\u201d Jim replied, summoning a smile before Bones disconnected the call.<br><br>\nAs soon as he disappeared from the screen, Jim heaved a deep sigh and leaned back into the chair. It wasn\u2019t even dusk and he already felt like sleeping again, having declined another offer by Spock to show him around Shi\u2019Khar.<br><br>\nHe simply felt too tired and exhausted. The nightmares were getting to him and the heat wasn\u2019t any help either. Even in the climatized house, the temperature was hardly bearable. Jim envied Amanda her years of assimilation.<br><br>\nWith a frown, Jim checked over the controls, his brain taking a bit to sort out the Vulcan symbols before he shut off the terminal.<br><br>\nJust a few more days and Bones would hopefully call back with news of a Starfleet vessel travelling by and picking him up. Jim could hardly wait</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nThe worst thing about the formal robes wasn\u2019t the color -- a shiny, metallic fabric -- or even the cut -- high collar, bell-shaped sleeves -- but the way they made Jim sweat even more than he already was ten seconds after putting them on.<br><br>\n\u201cI will die in these,\u201d he told Spock seriously as the Vulcan adjusted the folds to undoubtedly precise geometric angles. \u201cI will literally die.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cA set of robes has yet to cause premature death,\u201d Spock replied, showing no mercy as he tugged at Jim\u2019s sleeves. The bastard.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a million degrees out and this fabric doesn\u2019t let my skin breathe,\u201d Jim said, trying for some sort of logical argument. \u201cIt is very likely I will faint in the heat, given that they scheduled this at lunchtime of all things.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is not a mere luncheon,\u201d Spock argued reasonably and God, where did he dig up this kind of vocabulary? \u201cIt is a traditional mid-day meal, a most honorable occasion. In addition, while I would share your concerns about the heat were the ceremony to take place outside, it is actually held in the Hall of Ancient Thought at Mount Seleya, where it is much cooler.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMuch cooler, really? Are we talking Vulcan cool or Human cool?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDue to the thick layers of rock surrounding the Hall, the average temperature there usually resides at about eleven degrees Celsius.\u201d<br><br>\nJim nearly sighed with bliss at the mere thought. \u201cThat actually sounds wonderful.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock inclined his head. \u201cThe Hall itself is impenetrable to both communication and transporter signals. Therefore, you will be transported as close to the entrance as possible, where an Elder will await you and lead you to your final destination.\u201d Spock paused and stepped back, looking Jim over before giving one nod. \u201cYou look adequate for the occasion.\u201d<br><br>\nStill, he eyed Jim\u2019s grown-out hair in a way that made Jim fear that Spock was considering a Vulcan haircut. Hurriedly, Jim redirected his attention: \u201cSo, the Hall of Ancient Thought. Isn\u2019t that where all the important <em>katra</em> are stored?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock inclined his head. \u201cIndeed. Among the valuable and ancient artifacts stored there and in the adjacent chambers are the <em>katra</em> of our most esteemed predecessors as well as the <em>Kir\u2019Shara</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThe artifact that contains all writings of Surak?\u201d Jim asked for confirmation.<br><br>\n\u201cThe very same.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIf it\u2019s such a holy and important place, why invite me there for lunch of all things?\u201d Jim asked, honestly confused. Both the Mountain and the Hall were practically the Vulcan equivalent to divine temples. Jim couldn\u2019t imagine himself munching on fruit and bread while sitting amongst Vulcan\u2019s most precious artifacts.<br><br>\nSpock grew very still. He took a few seconds, possibly to contemplate his explanation, then spoke very precisely: \u201cAs I have stated before, it is a most honorable occasion. Few ceremonies are held in the Hall, even fewer allow outsiders to participate. The only Human to have been invited in recent years is, in fact, my mother.\u201d<br><br>\nJim swallowed. No pressure, huh?<br><br>\n\u201cI know you are uncomfortable with being praised for your actions regarding the safety of Vulcan, but I cannot stress enough how much your sacrifice is appreciated among my people,\u201d Spock continued. \u201cThe Elders have decided to bestow this honor upon you, undoubtedly to show you their regard for your actions, <em>oveh</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nAnd they were back to that again. Great. Jim knew he did a poor job suppressing the scowl forming on his face.<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t need ceremonial luncheons,\u201d Jim replied curtly. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>want</em> them.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock narrowed his eyes at him ever so slightly. \u201cWould you like me to inform the Elders and cancel the meeting?\u201d<br><br>\nJim was very tempted to say yes, but he had taken more than enough diplomacy classes at the Academy to see the blatant offense in that.<br><br>\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Spock gave him a tight nod and gestured towards the hallway.<br><br>\nIt spoke of Sarek\u2019s importance and the wealth of Spock\u2019s family that there was a small but fully functional transporter pad installed in their house. While, according to Spock, it was only used for special occasions, Jim doubted this was standard equipment in every Vulcan home. The planet had to have public transporter stations like any other planet.<br><br>\nSometimes, it was easy to forget that Spock was an ambassador\u2019s son. His family had to be part of what boiled down to the Vulcan upper class: old clan name, vast wealth, extremely well educated even for Vulcan standards, greatly respected by their people. Just thinking about it was kind of intimidating.<br><br>\nSarek was waiting for them at the small terminal when they arrived.<br><br>\n\u201cThe High Council awaits you, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d he said formally and gestured towards the pad after handing Jim a small, thin communication device which he could fit easily in one of the slim pockets in his robes.<br><br>\n\u201cYou are not coming, <em>kevet-dutar</em>?\u201d Jim asked as he stepped up on the designated spot. After all, it had been Sarek who had extended the invitation.<br><br>\n\u201cI am not part of the High Council, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d Sarek explained as Spock stepped up to the terminal. \u201cOur clan\u2019s seat is held by the honorable T\u2019Pau.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cT\u2019Pau?\u201d Jim repeated. \u201cWait, the T\u2019Pau?\u201d<br><br>\nSarek inclined his head, glancing at his son working the controls. \u201cAre you ready to depart, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d<br><br>\nStill awed by this particular revelation, Jim nodded. If T\u2019Pau was the clan mother of Spock\u2019s family, they had to be even more influential than Jim had already assumed.<br><br>\nThe last thing he saw before the world dissolved around him was Spock\u2019s serious face focusing on the control panel as he monitored Jim\u2019s transport.<br><br>\nThe first thing he was aware of in his new surroundings was the heat. It was sweltering, even though Jim saw that he had been sent to a place currently covered in the shadow of Mount Seleya. Almost immediately, pearls of sweat were starting to gather on his neck and back and rolled down his sticky skin. Great.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Oveh</em>,\u201d a brittle voice called from his right. \u201c<em>Dif-tor heh smusma.</em>\u201d<br><br>\nJim turned to see a truly elderly Vulcan present him with the <em>ta\u2019al</em>, his fingers gnarled with age. His straight hair was snow-white and thin, hardly numerous enough to cover his forehead in the straight bangs most Vulcans favored. Jim doubted he was the youngest of the High Council. Why they would send him of all Elders to pick him up, he honestly couldn\u2019t understand.<br><br>\nRemembering his manners, Jim returned the greeting, careful to use honorifics in his speech. His robes rustled as a light wind picked up, but the breeze brought dry, hot air instead of a cool-off. Jim tried his hardest not to sway at the sudden increase in temperature.<br><br>\n\u201cI am Sunvar,\u201d the Elder introduced himself. His Standard had an odd melodic quality to it. \u201cYou are not accustomed to these temperatures. Let us retire quickly to the Hall.\u201d<br><br>\nFor a guy his age, Jim noticed as they made their way up the rocky slope to the concealed entrance, he was still very agile. Sunvar was not even out of breath when they entered into the tunnel leading inside the mountain, whereas Jim was catching his breath, feeling his robes cling to his sticky back.<br><br>\nSpock had been right, however, when he had told Jim that the inside of Mount Seleya would be much cooler. Jim let out a big sigh when he felt like he could breathe again. Undoubtedly, he\u2019d start shivering in a minute due to the sudden plunge in temperature. Jim had never been so happy about goosebumps forming on his arms.<br><br>\n\u201cThe Council is honored by your acceptance of our invitation, <em>oveh</em>\u201d, Sunvar told him as they made their way further into the mountain.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m honored as well by your invitation, <em>osa-su</em>,\u201d Jim replied formally, feeling uneasy. He hadn\u2019t truly considered how stiff and awkward this meeting would probably be, as focused as he had been on engineering his quick departure from Vulcan. \u201cI realize it\u2019s not common procedure to invite outworlders to the Hall.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou are correct, we do not usually invite outworlders here, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d Sunvar replied, throwing Jim a look that seemed oddly intense. He did not say anything else, though.<br><br>\nThe tunnel ended and lead directly into an impressive chamber. Huge stone statues of what were clearly honored Vulcans of the past lined the Hall, with one of them placed right in the middle of the chamber. Even Jim could recognize Surak\u2019s face in the rock-hewn features.<br><br>\n\u201cWelcome to the Hall of Ancient Thought, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d Sunvar announced.<br><br>\nClose to the giant statue of Surak, Jim noticed a large wooden table. Bowls of food were set out on it. Clearly, this was where the meal would take place. Around the table, the rest of the High Council had already taken their seats. As Jim and Sunvar approached, the Elders rose to greet Jim with the <em>ta\u2019al</em>. Suddenly feeling incredibly intimidated by the procedures, Jim returned the gesture, hoping his hand wasn\u2019t shaking as much as he thought it was.<br><br>\n\u201cWe greet thee, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d a regal voice announced in stilted Standard. Jim instantly recognized its bearer as T\u2019Pau. Jim doubted there were many people in the Federation who hadn\u2019t heard of T\u2019Pau, one of the most influential Vulcans in existence. T\u2019Pau\u2019s face looked as serious as it befit a Vulcan, her graying hair placed in an elaborate braid around her formal headdress. Her robes were the most embellished of all, clearly a sign of her superior position even among the Council.<br><br>\nAnd to think that Spock was what basically boiled down to her grandson -- Jim swallowed nervously as he inclined his head at her.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m honored by your invitation,\u201d he replied carefully, feeling like any misused word might offend the Council. Which was actually pretty likely. Crap. He should have researched proper protocol for this or at least asked Spock for advice.<br><br>\n\u201cPlease take your place by my side, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d T\u2019Pau said, pointing elegantly at the empty chair to her left. \u201cSo we may begin with the meal.\u201d<br><br>\nFeeling all eyes on him, Jim carefully made his way around the table and towards his assigned chair. Nervous thoughts made his stomach queasy. Were his robes still looking adequate? Did his face look red and sweaty? Were there any special eating rules he should know of?<br><br>\nJim nearly stumbled as he stepped up to his chair, feet tangling in his robes. Luckily, he didn\u2019t end up falling face-first into the table. God, he would end up embarrassing himself, wouldn\u2019t he?<br><br>\n\u201cLet us be seated,\u201d T\u2019Pau said and everyone obliged, Jim hurrying to sit down as well without messing with the folds of his robes.<br><br>\nThere was an empty plate in front of him, but no cutlery. Also, he noticed, there were two young Vulcans standing off to the side who were clearly not part of the Council. With their plain robes and neat but standard hairstyles, they would clearly serve as some sort of waiters during the meal.<br><br>\nThe food itself turned out to be mainly luscious pieces of various Vulcan fruit and vegetables as well as baked goods. Most of it Jim had never seen before, though he figured they would likely taste as all things Vulcan - very tart, slightly sweet or almost bitter, but not necessarily bad.<br><br>\n\u201cWe shall eat first before we will begin with the ceremony,\u201d T\u2019Pau said and the two young Vulcans stepped forward, each taking a carafe of water from the table. They started with Jim and T\u2019Pau, filling their glasses with water before moving around in circles.<br><br>\n\u201cHonorable T\u2019Pau,\u201d the Vulcan to her other side spoke up and T\u2019Pau turned her head. Unlike the Elders Jim had heard so far, his Standard was accent-less. Jim could not tell whether or not the interruption annoyed T\u2019Pau, but he got a sense that he was interrupting what was standard protocol for these kind of occasions. \u201cMay I suggest explaining to the honorable James Kirk the aim of this meeting before we commence the meal? It would leave him some time to mentally and emotionally prepare for the ceremony, as Humans tend to prefer.\u201d<br><br>\nJim eyed the Elder with interest. His face was wrinkled with age, his hair a dignified mix of gray and white. He was sporting a haircut almost exactly like Spock\u2019s. Really, now that he was looking at him more closely, Jim figured this particular Vulcan could well be related to him. But then, Jim didn\u2019t know enough about the Vulcan gene pool to properly distinguish between family resemblance and mere shared Vulcanoid traits.<br><br>\n\u201cYour suggestion is logical, Selek,\u201d T\u2019Pau replied before she turned towards Jim, who swallowed. What sort of \u2018proposition\u2019 could the Council possibly have for him? \u201c<em>Oveh</em>, it is our wish to grant thee Vulcan citizenship in honor of your deeds regarding the battle against the time-travelling Romulan known as Nero.\u201d<br><br>\nThey -- what? Jim was faintly aware that he was gaping, but was too busy trying to wrap his mind around the concept to try and do anything about it.<br><br>\n\u201cI -- excuse me?\u201d he finally said, too shocked to be embarrassed by his lack of coherence in the face of the Vulcan Council.<br><br>\nT\u2019Pau raised her left eyebrow by the slightest degree, but dutifully repeated: \u201cIt is our wish to grant thee Vulcan citizenship in honor of your deeds regarding the battle against the time-travelling Romulan known as Nero.\u201d<br><br>\nShaking his head, Jim raised a hand. \u201cNo, I got that -- I mean, wait.\u201d He took a deep breath, fighting the blush threatening to spread on his cheek. Hadn\u2019t he said he\u2019d embarrass himself? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, <em>oko-su</em>, what I meant to say is: Why would you want to do that?\u201d<br><br>\nFrom what Jim could tell, T\u2019Pau looked at him like he was a particularly slow child. He\u2019d bet good credits she was already regretting their proposition. \u201cAs I stated, it is to honor your service to our people. As a token of our appreciation, we had already asked the healers to bestow upon you a physical sign of our wish to make thee one of our people.\u201d<br><br>\nHer eyes rested briefly on his left ear. Jim automatically reached for it, tracing the pointed tip with his fingers. \u201cOh,\u201d was all he could say, suddenly feeling too overwhelmed to speak.<br><br>\nA Vulcan citizen -- him? God, he didn\u2019t even know Vulcans granted any outworlder citizenship unless they were married to one of their own, and that wasn\u2019t a common occurrence either. Vulcans were so keen on keeping their culture and lives private that it was hard even to learn anything in detail about them, let alone be accepted into their circles.<br><br>\nJim had a hard time wrapping his mind around the concept.<br><br>\n\u201cDo you object to our proposition, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d another Elder asked, her speech patterns less antiquated than T\u2019Pau\u2019s but no less formal. She was outright frowning at him from underneath her curly bangs, an emotional display Jim would hardly have expected from an honorable Elder such as her.<br><br>\nIt hit him, then, that a response in the negative would be a grave insult towards Vulcan, and that the way he had acted so far hadn\u2019t shown much appreciation for their clearly highly generous offer. Looking around, he saw more than one face show a hint of or an outright frown.<br><br>\nPanicking a bit, Jim hurried to try and set things right. \u201cNot at all, <em>oko-su</em>,\u201d he said towards the Vulcan that had spoken up before letting his eyes wander around the table as he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... unexpected. I realize that my actions have played a part in saving Vulcan, but it really wasn\u2019t just me alone. I didn\u2019t think it would merit such a -- um, gracious offer. I\u2019m honored, really.\u201d<br><br>\nThat did seem to settle most of the frowns, though it was clear they were still not happy with him. Great.<br><br>\n\u201cYou do not believe to have shown extraordinary service to the Vulcan people by sacrificing your life to save our planet?\u201d T\u2019Pau asked. Jim had the feeling that her voice sounded pretty incredulous for a Vulcan.<br><br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sacrifice my life, <em>oko-su</em>,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m still alive, after all.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI believe what my esteemed peers are trying to convey, Mr. Kirk,\u201d the Elder Selek interjected smoothly, \u201cis that you were willing to sacrifice your life. As we all know, your survival was a statistical anomaly. You could not have known Nero would beam you aboard quickly enough for you to survive exposure to the vacuum of space. Neither was it likely you would live through his torture.\u201d<br><br>\nSuppressing a shudder at Selek\u2019s words, Jim almost missed the unusual form of address. And really, was he imagining it or did Selek seem more laid back about the whole thing than the other Elders? When Jim looked at him more closely, Selek winked at him, only once, before returning his eyes to T\u2019Pau.<br><br>\nJim tried his hardest not to embarrass himself again with another round of gaping. What the hell?<br><br>\n\u201cSelek\u2019s explanation is sound,\u201d T\u2019Pau said. \u201cAm I correct in deducing that you are, in fact, not rejecting our offer?\u201d<br><br>\nFeeling trapped, Jim said the only thing he could reasonably say: \u201cOf course I accept. I am \u2026 very honored.\u201d<br><br>\nWith that, the issue was apparently resolved, as T\u2019Pau nodded and commenced the meal by raising her filled glass to her lips.<br><br>\nJim kept mostly quiet as they ate, taking his cue from the Elders and eating with his hands, taking from whatever bowl he liked. Knowing that Vulcans much prefered to eat using cutlery, Jim figured that this was part of the traditions involved, though he honestly could not find the energy to figure out why.<br><br>\nEven as he was chewing on a fibrous sort of Vulcan berry, his thoughts were with what had just occurred. Had he really agreed to become a Vulcan citizen? What would that even involve? Would he be expected to reside on Vulcan, get a house here?<br><br>\nOverwhelmed, Jim kept his eyes down as he ate, hoping fiercely that everything would work out fine</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nThe ceremony itself had been short and to the point, though a Vulcan gong and ritual words had been involved. Undoubtedly, the Council had already asked somebody else to take care of the paperwork, as all that had been required of Jim in form of legal work had been one signature on a provided PADD.<br><br>\nHe had received an IDIC symbol, pinned to his formal robes, and a small data chip containing the entirety of Surak\u2019s teaching in Federation Standard, now hanging off a simple thin chain around his neck.<br><br>\nHis head was still reeling with all that had happened as he bid every single Elder goodbye personally, lips wrapping around the Vulcan phrases without much conscious thought, nodding gratefully as they welcomed him to the Vulcan people. As nobody frowned at him again, he figured he hadn\u2019t further embarrassed himself or offended anybody.<br><br>\nSelek was the last Elder to step up to him, but unlike the others, he had not come to say goodbye just yet.<br><br>\n\u201cIf you are amenable, I would like to guide you back to a suitable point of transportation,\u201d he said, eyes twinkling in a way that made him look highly amused. Jim didn\u2019t know whether to feel uncomfortable or calmed by the Vulcan\u2019s unusual behavior.<br><br>\nThey made their way towards the tunnel Jim and Sunvar had entered through. Selek chose a slower pace as if this were a leisurely amble between old friends.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Osa-su</em>, was there \u2026 something you wanted to talk about?\u201d Jim finally asked, unnerved by the silence.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed there was, Mr. Kirk,\u201d the Elder replied and stopped close to the entrance. Jim could nearly feel the blistering heat that waited outside on his cooled skin.<br><br>\nAgain, Jim noted that Selek did not bother calling him the special honorific everyone seemed so fond of. It didn\u2019t seem disrespectful, though. Rather, Selek seemed to aim to sound familiar.<br><br>\n\u201cHave I done something?\u201d Jim ventured when Selek did not explain himself.<br><br>\nSelek\u2019s mouth twisted in a way that could nearly be called a smile. Jim stared at him.<br><br>\n\u201cNo, Mr. Kirk, you have done nothing, at least nothing to offend me, which I believe is what you were asking.\u201d Selek\u2019s eyes crinkled in a way that reminded Jim of a kindly grandfather before he turned more serious. \u201cIn fact, it is I who has done something of offense.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh?\u201d Could Vulcans be anymore fucking cryptic?<br><br>\n\u201cI believe you are not yet familiar with the full story behind your rescue and the rescue of Vulcan,\u201d Selek continued. \u201cThe fault lies mainly with me.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWith you?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Selek said. He inclined his head and the friendly twinkle in his eyes had died. \u201cI must admit that my own actions lead to the near destruction of my home planet.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYour actions?\u201d Jim repeated dumbly. \u201cWhat do you mean? It was Nero who attacked Vulcan!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd it was I who provoked Nero into attacking the planet.\u201d Selek\u2019s voice sounded brittle during his admission and for the first time during their conversation, he averted his gaze to stare outside the tunnel into the red heat of Vulcan.<br><br>\n\u201cBut \u2026 how?\u201d Jim asked, flabbergasted.<br><br>\nAs of now, he had not been sure about Nero\u2019s exact motives to attack Vulcan. During torture, he had mentioned revenge several times, but nothing specific. As the Romulan had acted crazy in the past, Jim had simply assumed that time travelling did things to people. After all, Nero had had no reason to attack the <em>Kelvin</em> over two decades ago either.<br><br>\n\u201cTo understand that, I will first have to make you understand that I am not who the Council makes me appear to be to the public. I am not merely another Elder.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOkay. And who are you then?\u201d Jim asked carefully.<br><br>\n\u201cLike Nero, I am not from this timeline. In fact, I am from the very timeline from which Nero stems. We both fell through the same black hole and into this universe, though I arrived much later than him.\u201d<br><br>\nJim swallowed nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d he admitted helplessly.<br><br>\nSelek\u2019s eyes were sad when they locked with Jim\u2019s once more.<br><br>\n\u201cI am Spock.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d<br><br>\nIf he weren\u2019t so busy feeling ridiculed, Jim might be bothered by the fact that he had just cussed at a respected Vulcan Elder.<br><br>\n\u201cI understand it is not easy to believe--\u201d<br><br>\n\u2028\u201cNot easy to believe?\u201d Jim interrupted. He wasn't sure whether to feel annoyed or merely confused. Surely, the actual Spock would have told him about this. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019re playing, or what agenda you\u2019re trying to push, but--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Selek interrupted, and it was only the raw, un-Vulcan desperation in his voice that made Jim halt in his speech. \u201cPlease let me explain. I am not trying to trick you, Jim.\u201d<br><br>\nAnd now he was calling him <em>Jim.</em> He was suddenly reminded of the similarities he had thought he'd seen during the ceremony earlier, the way Selek had talked and held himself, things that had indeed reminded him of Spock. If this was really true -- well. Jim didn't really know what to think.<br><br>\n\"Explain yourself then,\" he said.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is \u2026 hard to explain in words,\u201d Selek replied. \"I would rather show you.\"<br><br>\n\u201cShow me?\u201d Jim repeated. \"Show me how?\"<br><br>\nSelek raised a hand and, before Jim could do anything about it, placed it on Jim\u2019s face. \u201cMy mind to your mind, old friend,\u201d he said, and the next thing Jim knew he was falling, falling, falling and he was<br><br>\nseeing Spock, a different version than the one he knew, this one edgier, his face thinner, but nonetheless Spock, who was looking at himself in a mirror as he smoothed out the last wrinkles in his blue science uniform, meaning that he was seeing this through Spock\u2019s eyes, wasn\u2019t he, and then he was<br><br>\nstanding on the bridge of what was obviously the <em>Enterprise</em> and in the chair, it was Jim, unmistakably Jim, hazel eyes or no, and Spock was saying \u201cCaptain\u201d in a way that conveyed much more than professional respect because there was warmth, affection even, and then he was<br><br>\nolder, feeling much older, and there was a sadness lodged in his chest he could not feel ashamed about, no matter how Vulcan he was, and he was working in a lab, ignoring his pain, his loss as he looked through thick glass at a red, pulsing mass, and then he was<br><br>\nbeing swamped by one memory after another, one layer of thought after another until he understood what had happened, the failure that was rescuing Romulus, being stranded on Delta Vega, seeking out this universe\u2019s version of Montgomery Scott as quickly as possible to prevent the worst<br><br>\nand when he finally emerged, Jim\u2019s head was reeling and he was stumbling backwards until his back met the wall and his head hit the stone wall of the tunnel with a thump. Breathing heavily, Jim sank to the floor, one hand curling uselessly against the wall as he kneeled on the floor, trying his hardest not to throw up as he pressed his free palm against his forehead.<br><br>\n\u201cForgive me, Jim,\u201d Selek -- no, <em>Spock</em> said breathlessly. \"My emotions -- I fear they have affected the meld.\" He settled a wrinkled hand on Jim\u2019s shoulder.<br><br>\nBut Jim didn\u2019t want him anywhere near him, because he was hurting and his head was filled with pictures that didn\u2019t belong there, an explanation who Nero was and why he had done what he had done mingled with a hundred scenes of a life he had never lived among people he hardly knew, but apparently considered family in another timeline, a timeline where he and Spock were apparently as close as Jim and Bones.<br><br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he gasped, and Spock immediately complied, stepping back to give Jim some space.<br><br>\nIt took him several minutes to calm down. When he no longer felt like the world had been shaken by an earthquake, Jim carefully got up, his shiny robes hanging dirty and wrinkled around his trembling legs.<br><br>\n\u201cYou \u2026 you were the one who abducted the ship?\u201d Jim gasped, running a shaky hand over his face. \u201cYou made sure the red matter was out of Nero\u2019s grasp?\u201d<br><br>\nGravely, Spock nodded. And God, this was Spock, an old version of Spock, a Spock who had served as his First Officer for years and had, apparently, lead the crazy Romulan Nero to this universe and thus nearly triggered Vulcan\u2019s destruction.<br><br>\nThis was \u2026 too much to take. Way too much to take.<br><br>\n\u201cI understand if you are angry with me,\u201d the old Spock said quietly.<br><br>\nAngry? Jim wasn\u2019t feeling angry. Hell, he didn\u2019t know what he was feeling but confusion and disorientation.<br><br>\n\u201cI want to go back,\u201d he managed. \u201cTo Spock\u2019s-- I mean, the other Spock\u2019s home.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI do not think that wise. I have not sufficiently explained--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Jim snapped and, okay, maybe he was angry after all. With the way his head felt right now, he definitely had a right to be. The thing, the meld -- it had felt invasive. Personal. Painful. \u201cI can't talk to you right now, okay? I just-- I need time. Please.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded again. His face seemed even more lined and wrinkled than before. Jim was too agitated to give it more than a fleeting thought. With a last sad look for Jim, Spock turned to leave the tunnel.<br><br>\nJim stumbled after the old Vulcan, head still reeling. A sharp headache akin to the one he had felt after waking up in the hospital was pulsing in his temples, making him feel sick and unbalanced.<br><br>\n\u201cThe transporter signal will be able to reach you here,\u201d old Spock said as they had brought some distance between themselves and the mountain. \u201cHowever, I really must ask you to reconsider and--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jim snapped, swaying a bit as he reached for the small communication device in his pocket. Pushing the right button, he spoke harshly into it. \u201cAnyone there?\u201d<br><br><em>Spock speaking.</em><br><br>\nThrowing a glare at the old Spock for no real reason, Jim managed a \u201cCan you beam me back?\u201d before he had to take a deep breath and close his eyes. The sudden return of the heat combined with the repercussions of the mind meld were playing havoc with his body.<br><br><em>Of course. Please move as little as possible as I lock onto your position.</em><br><br>\nJim swallowed. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br><br>\nThe last thing Jim saw before he dissolved was old Spock\u2019s worried face, shoulders slumped as he watched Jim vanish.</p>\n<p>The first thing Spock noticed as Kirk contacted him through the communication device was how upset he sounded. His voice was shaky in a way that reminded Spock of Kirk\u2019s post-nightmare state of mind.<br><br>\nDeducing logically that the meeting with the Elders was most likely the cause of this, Spock focused on transporting Kirk back as quickly as possible, not wanting to extend his stay with the Council any longer than strictly necessary. He knew from his own experience how upsetting Vulcan Elders could be, no matter how hard it was to admit to such emotions.<br><br>\nIt took him a few seconds to make sure he had locked onto Kirk properly, then started the transportation process. Looking at the pad, Spock observed as Kirk slowly materialized on the transporter platform. And promptly collapsed as soon as the sparkling lights vanished.<br><br>\n\u201cJim!\u201d Spock called out illogically before catching himself and approaching the platform.<br><br>\nKirk was on his knees, breathing heavily and clutching his head. As he came closer, Spock could hear that the man was letting out small, pained keening noises. Kneeling down next to him, Spock placed a careful hand on Kirk\u2019s shoulder.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat happened? Do you require medical assistance?\u201d<br><br>\nBut Kirk did not respond, only shook his head as he took short, staggered breaths.<br><br>\nSensing that he was not equipped to deal with this alone, Spock called out loudly for his father, who he knew to be in his nearby office. Sarek appeared quickly, taking in the scene with one observing look before approaching Spock and Kirk.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he echoed Spock\u2019s earlier words, refraining from touching Kirk as Spock had done, but kneeling down next to him as well.<br><br>\n\u201cJim asked to be beamed back, sounding emotionally strained. When he arrived, he simply collapsed. He appears to be in pain but remains as of yet unable to voice the reason behind it or explain what exactly occurred.\u201d<br><br>\nSarek gave a serious nod.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Oveh</em>,\u201d he said, making his own attempt to reach Kirk. \u201c<em>Oveh</em>, can you explain what happened? Are you injured?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHurts,\u201d was all Kirk managed between his harsh breathing.<br><br>\nComing to a decision, Spock used his free arm to manoeuvre Kirk\u2019s trembling frame until he could reach under his knees and back, lifting him with little effort.<br><br>\n\u201cI will bring him to his room and try to calm him. Please, <em>osa-mekh</em>, call for Healer T\u2019Lkai at Shi\u2019Khar hospital. Have her beam here as quickly as possible. As her primary physician on Vulcan, she knows Jim\u2019s medical history and will be most likely to know of a solution. In his current condition, I deem it unwise to expose him just yet to another transporter beam to send him to the hospital.\u201d<br><br>\nSarek conceded his logic with one nod and stepped up to the transportation panel, undoubtedly to place the requested call.<br><br>\nConfident that his father would deal with this situation in an appropriate fashion, Spock hurried to carry Kirk to his room. Of course, it was inevitable that Spock\u2019s mother had picked up on the commotion and she met him in the hallway.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked immediately as she saw Kirk trembling and whimpering in Spock\u2019s arms, face hidden behind his own hands.<br><br>\n\u201cWe do not yet know,\u201d Spock said tightly as he brushed past Amanda, confident she would fall into step beside him. \u201cJim arrived in this state as he returned from the meeting with the Council. Father is calling for a healer to determine how and where he was injured.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock hurried the remaining meters to Kirk\u2019s room, entering and approaching the bed where he carefully placed the Human on top of the mattress.<br><br>\n\u201cWe should get him out of those robes,\u201d Amanda suggested, having followed Spock into the room.<br><br>\nTaking in the soiled and crumpled state of the garment, Spock agreed. He hardly wasted time to contemplate the significance of either the shiny IDIC symbol pinned to Kirk\u2019s robes or the data chip hanging off the thin chain around his neck. Together with his mother, Spock guided Kirk\u2019s trembling limbs until they had extracted him from the stifling garment, leaving him in his thin underwear.<br><br>\nAll the while Kirk whimpered, eyes unfocused as he repeatedly tried to free his hands to press them against this head. The few times Spock\u2019s bare skin brushed against Kirk\u2019s during the undressing process, he could pick up on genuine distress and pain.<br><br>\n\u201cDo you think it might be a mental problem?\u201d Amanda said quietly as they could do nothing further but cover Kirk with the blanket, stand by the bed and wait for the healer. \u201cThis looks like the sort of fit I had when your father and I had yet to find a balance with our mental bond.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI am unsure, mother,\u201c Spock admitted. \u201cSurely, the Elders had no reason to connect with his mind. And certainly, they would not allow him to return if they had done so and caused this state.\u201d<br><br>\nHis mother nodded thoughtfully, brow furrowed in clear worry and she sank down on the edge of the bed, placing a hand on Kirk\u2019s arm like she had often done when Spock was sick as a child. He swallowed at the sight and looked away, stepping towards the slide door to observe the hallway and look out for the healer.<br><br>\nT\u2019Lkai and Sarek strode towards Kirk\u2019s room 4.2 minutes later, another healer Spock did not recognize with them. Both T\u2019Lkai and the unfamiliar healer were carrying medical cases.<br><br>\nSkipping the formal greeting, T\u2019Lkai and the other healer simply nodded at Spock before passing him to enter the room and approach Kirk.<br><br>\nAmanda immediately got up and stepped aside, her hand falling off Kirk\u2019s arm as she made space for the healers.<br><br>\n\u201cHealer T\u2019Lkai brought the honorable T\u2019Lona, an experienced mindhealer,\u201d Sarek explained quietly. \u201cAfter describing Mr. Kirk\u2019s symptoms to her, T\u2019Lkai thought it likely that this was a mental affliction.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded. He watched as the two healers observed Kirk whimpering and trembling on the bed before launching into quiet conversation. T\u2019Lkai traced Kirk\u2019s form with a tricorder from her medical case. Feeling responsible as Kirk\u2019s official caretaker, Spock stepped away from his father and approached them.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat is your diagnosis?\u201d he asked the healers when T\u2019Lkai put away the scanner.<br><br>\n\u201cWe are uncertain as of yet, only that it is clearly a problem of the mind,\u201d T\u2019Lona explained calmly. \u201cI will attempt a shallow mind meld to assess the situation and go deeper once I have ascertained the cause of his symptoms.\u201d<br><br>\nBefore Spock could voice any objections or further questions, T\u2019Lona had bowed over Kirk\u2019s form and placed her hand in the familiar pattern, her dark-brown hand in stark contrast to Kirk\u2019s pale and sickly face. Kirk immediately ceased any noise or movement as their minds connected.<br><br>\nFor a few minutes, the room was silent as T\u2019Lona probed Kirk\u2019s mind.<br><br>\nWhen she emerged, she appeared visibly less calm than before, slightly shaking her head as if it would help her clear her mind of what she had just encountered in Kirk\u2019s.<br><br>\nKirk himself stayed calm where he lay on the bed, breath evening out as he slipped into what appeared to be a deep slumber.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d T\u2019Lkai asked her colleague when T\u2019Lona had regained control and smoothed her face.<br><br>\n\u201cHe was suffering from the aftereffects of a deep and rather uncontrolled mind meld,\u201d T\u2019Lona told them, a trace of surprise coloring her voice. \u201cWhoever connected to him was severely emotionally compromised and caused the honorable Mr. Kirk\u2019s mind to be overwhelmed. I have now calmed his mind and brought superficial order into the chaos. I believe the original meld served to transfer a significant amount of memories in a very quick and rapid way. Even for a more disciplined mind, it would have been a considerable amount of information to process.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou said he was with the Council before he returned, <em>kevet-dutar</em>?\u201d T\u2019Lkai looked past Spock and towards the door, where Sarek stood next to his wife.<br><br>\nSpock\u2019s mother must have walked over to him while the healers had been busy assessing Kirk\u2019s state of health. Spock had not even noticed, so focused had he been on Kirk and T\u2019Lona. It was unlike him to lose track of his surroundings like this.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Sarek replied, voice tense. \u201cI shall contact them and ask them how Mr. Kirk came to be in this state. I am sure there must be a logical explanation for this.\u201d<br><br>\nHe nodded at the healers, his fingers brushing past Amanda\u2019s for the briefest of seconds before he left the room. Spock quickly returned his eyes to the healers.<br><br>\n\u201cWhen will he wake up?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHe was physically exhausted as well,\u201d T\u2019Lkai said. \u201cIt is clear the heat of Vulcan is not ideal for his Human physiology, especially in his still weakened state. My estimate is at least four hours, possibly more. It would be unwise to attempt to rouse him from a slumber this deep. His body is obviously in need of further rest.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMr. Kirk should be calm and lucid upon wakening,\u201d T\u2019Lona added. \u201cI recommend helping him discipline his mind to deal with the additional disarray. You may ask for my assistance if you find yourself having difficulties. My colleague Stalat has, I believe, informed you of the already existing mental trauma Mr. Kirk has suffered before his hospitalization.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded, his thoughts on the implications of the healers\u2019 assessment. Kirk was suffering from an ill-performed mind meld. Spock could not think who on Vulcan would risk the man\u2019s health with such a careless action, especially amongst the Elders.<br><br>\nAs there was nothing they could do for now, the healers left for the hospital. Spock and his mother remained standing by Kirk\u2019s side with orders to contact either healer should Kirk not wake within the next twelve hours or show the same symptoms as before.<br><br>\n\u201cSurely, the Elders didn\u2019t attempt a mind meld,\u201d Amanda said after both T\u2019Lkai and T\u2019Lona had left.<br><br>\n\u201cI can think of no logical reason,\u201d Spock agreed, staring down at Kirk, now covered with his blanket. Apart from the ever-present film of sweat, he looked calm and peaceful as he slept. He was no longer as sickly pale as before and the trembling had ceased completely but for the occasional flutter of his eyelids.<br><br>\nIt was in this moment that Sarek returned to the room, his face serious. Amanda threw him a worried look before ushering all of them out of Kirk\u2019s room, reminding them that he needed to rest and was not to be woken.<br><br>\nShe used the sensor to slide the door half-shut before turning towards her husband, who had clearly returned with an explanation.<br><br>\n\u201cIt appears one of the Elders has indeed performed a mind meld on Mr. Kirk,\u201d Sarek said at once.<br><br>\nSpock stiffened, disbelief clouding his mind. \u201cImpossible.\u201d<br><br>\nSarek threw him a disapproving glance before continuing. \u201cIt was Selek.\u201d<br><br>\nFor a moment, Spock could not breathe, let alone reply.<br><br>\nHis mother had no such problems, apparently. \u201cYou mean, the other Spock? He did this?\u201d<br><br>\nSarek inclined his head, mouth tight. \u201cIt appears he was convinced that a mind meld would be the most practical way to explain the circumstances of his arrival in our timeline and the cause of Nero\u2019s madness. He had, however, not realized how compromised he still was from what has occurred.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhy did he let Jim leave in a state like this?\u201d Spock demanded, feeling a nearly uncontrollable rush of anger at his older counterpart.<br><br>\n\u201cHe said Mr. Kirk refused any help as well as his advice to delay departure.\u201d The icy tone of voice his father had adapted clearly spoke of his own anger. Spock could not shake off the thought that Sarek blamed him for the actions of his counterpart, although they were not the same person.<br><br>\nIt took all of Spock\u2019s self-control not to curl his fingers into fists of anger or grab his father by the robes and shake him. His anger at the other Spock mingled with the ever-festering resentment he had felt towards Sarek ever since their fallout over Spock\u2019s rejection of his place at the Vulcan Science Academy.<br><br>\n\u201cAt least we know what happened now,\u201d Amanda interjected, probably sensing another argument coming and trying to prevent it. \u201cIf Healer T\u2019Lona is correct, Jim will be just fine, so it\u2019s--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd if he is not?\u201d Spock interrupted her, his voice harsher than strictly appropriate. He promptly received another icy look from his father.<br><br>\n\u201cDo not speak to your mother in this fashion,\u201d Sarek said at once. \u201cShe does not deserve this kind of treatment simply because you cannot control your emotions.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI did not--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWill you two stop it?\u201d Amanda looked upset in a way Spock had not seen often. \u201cThis is not about your childish feud, but about Jim.\u201d She took a deep breath, pressing two fingers to the bridge of her nose before continuing in a calmer voice: \u201cSpock, why don\u2019t you sit with Jim in case he wakes up and needs something?\u201d<br><br>\nNot wanting to upset his mother further, Spock inclined his head stiffly before turning back towards Kirk\u2019s room.<br><br>\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Amanda continued, now clearly addressing Sarek. \u201cSpock\u2019s worried, not purposely disrespectful, so--\u201d<br><br>\nSpock hurried to enter Kirk\u2019s room and let the door slide shut completely this time. It would not do to anger his father further by listening in on what would clearly be one of his mother\u2019s emotional speeches. Nonetheless, he could not help but feel a sense of satisfaction at his mother\u2019s defense of him.<br><br>\nNot having brought a chair, Spock simply stood by Kirk\u2019s bed. He laced his fingers together behind his back and settled in for a quiet wait, aiming to calm and order his mind as he watched Kirk breathe</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nKirk awoke 5.3 Standard hours later with nothing but a light headache and another unnecessary apology on his lips. Spock assured him that the latter was not required and informed him that the former would probably resolve itself, as it was a symptom of the mind meld, not a physical ailment.<br><br>\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve met the other you,\u201d Kirk said unnecessarily once he had taken a shower and dressed.<br><br>\nThey had settled in the parlour with Spock\u2019s Tri-D Chess set. Amanda had provided them with cool water and a snack after spending an unsettling amount of time touching and talking to Kirk. Spock knew it was the Human way to reassure and comfort each other after what had happened, but could not watch for long. Even after spending ample time among Humans, these sort of open emotional displays still seemed too intimate to him, especially when they involved his mother.<br><br>\n\u201cFor the sake of avoiding confusion and keeping his true identity secret from the general public, he now goes by the pseudonym of Selek,\u201d Spock said stiffly, not wanting Kirk to make the same mistake as his father and see them as one and the same.<br><br>\n\u201cFine,\u201d Kirk acknowledged, moving a pawn before looking at Spock. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d rather you told me when I asked you what happened to the red matter. Meeting him like this was \u2026 well. Not ideal, I think.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock felt his shoulder tense in spite of himself. He would have to meditate at length tonight. Clearly, today\u2019s events had unsettled him to a point where his control was slipping.<br><br>\n\u201cI apologize. It was Selek\u2019s expressive wish to inform you himself. At the time, it seemed only logical to comply, as you were in no state to deal with such delicate information. Had I known what consequences would come from the delay, however, I would have risked explaining it myself.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Kirk said immediately, making a point of catching Spock\u2019s eyes and holding them. His face was honest, open in a way Humans tended to be much too often. In this instance, the physical confirmation of Kirk\u2019s statement was reassuring.<br><br>\n\u201cI am gratified you have come to this conclusion.\u201d Spock caught Kirk\u2019s bishop after checking the board for a possible trap. From the way Kirk cursed under his breath, it had been mere inattentiveness on his part. \u201cIf you do not feel up to this match, we can play another time.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk shook his head. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll pay more attention now.\u201d<br><br>\nThey played quietly for a while before Kirk spoke up again, clearly trying for a casual tone. \u201cSo, what do you know about other Spock\u2019s-- I mean, about Selek\u2019s timeline? Did you guys talk a lot or something?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWe deemed it wise not to converse too much,\u201d Spock explained. \u201cHowever, I do know that in his universe, both your and my life were different.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSo you know about the <em>Enterprise</em>?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI know that I served as your First Officer on Selek\u2019s version of the <em>Enterprise</em>, yes.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk hesitated before saying: \u201cWeird, huh?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock ceased his observations of the board in favor of looking at Kirk. \u201cWhat, exactly, do you find \u2018weird\u2019?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, we also ended up on the <em>Enterprise</em>. And from what I gathered from other Spock\u2019s -- crap, I\u2019m sorry, really, I mean, from Selek\u2019s memories -- it was the same people on his ship. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, that kid Chekov. And it was them who helped rescue me, too, right? The ones who went out with you to get me back?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYes. Along with Montgomery Scott, as we required his knowledge about transwarp beaming to successfully infiltrate the <em>Narada</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd he just went along with it, right?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock inclined his head. \u201cHe was surprisingly amenable to the prospect of going on a rescue mission for a man he did not know personally. His reason, I believe, was that it \u2018sounded like fun\u2019.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s what I find weird. The same people, coming together and all.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock observed Kirk\u2019s face very carefully, noting the way he bit his lip in what he knew to be a Human sign of both contemplation and worry. \u201cAre you proposing a theory of predetermined events and principles constant among all existing timelines and universes?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThe word you\u2019re looking for is fate, but yeah, basically.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock shook his head. \u201cI cannot agree.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThere is no scientific proof to back your claim.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThat\u2019s just because we know next to nothing about the multiverse. You\u2019ve got to admit, though, the one example we\u2019ve experienced ourselves is in favor of my theory.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOne positive example does not make a proven and scientifically sound theory,\u201d Spock chastised him.<br><br>\n\u201cFine,\u201d Kirk replied, then added, \u201cCheck.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock threw a furtive glance at the board before gracefully saving the situation by moving his rook. From Kirk\u2019s reaction, it was obvious he had known it to be a weak move at best. He usually played much better than this.<br><br>\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Kirk continued. \u201cI\u2019m obviously not going to be captain of the <em>Enterprise</em> anytime soon in this universe.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhat makes you so certain of that?\u201d Spock replied. \u201cStarfleet has lost many experienced officers and you have proven yourself worthy of a command position through your actions during the fight with Nero. I have it on good authority that your field promotion to Commander will hold in honor of your services to Vulcan and the Federation as a whole. Once you return to active duty, it is not unlikely they might also provide you with Captain Pike\u2019s legacy. The <em>Enterprise</em> is still undergoing repairs and a definitive crew has not yet been chosen for its mission.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAs the former first officer and its temporary captain, wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to promote you to captain of the <em>Enterprise</em>?\u201d Kirk asked, clearly having lost all focus for their game at this turn of their conversation. He was staring at Spock with wide eyes, betraying his bewilderment.<br><br>\n\u201cI do not desire a captaincy,\u201d Spock informed him seriously. \u201cStarfleet is well aware my interests lie mainly in the sciences, interests I would not be able to pursue were I given the vast responsibilities of a captaincy. Additionally, Captain Pike has always spoken very highly of you. I believe he would have approved, should the Admiralty consider you the right candidate for the position.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou talked to Pike about me?\u201d Kirk seemed surprised by this. Spock did not miss the way Kirk\u2019s fingers curled around the edge of the table, but was unsure how to interpret this.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed. He asked to see me after I had filed the complaint about the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em>. He tried to convince me of the true motivation behind your actions and the general decency of your character. I must admit, I did not believe him at the time and thought his conclusions about your person to be rooted in irrational sentimentality. He was quite convinced of your formidable qualities.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHe said that about me?\u201d Kirk asked, sounding breathless. This time, Spock recognized the sadness and disbelief in Kirk\u2019s features.<br><br>\nSpock reminded himself that Pike and Kirk had been rather close. The captain had mentioned Kirk in conversation even before the <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> incident, speaking of him with fondness and a hint of pride. Undoubtedly, Kirk was still suffering from his loss in addition to his own trauma. Hearing about Pike\u2019s high opinion of him would undoubtedly be something Kirk could benefit from emotionally.<br><br>\nSpock had thought about and taken care of Kirk for a considerate amount of time now. He was able to admit to himself that Kirk\u2019s well-being was important to his own peace of mind, at least currently.<br><br>\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Spock confirmed. \u201cHe thought very highly of you and praised your abilities and character whenever he found it appropriate. I believe he was very fond of you, Jim.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk swallowed at this, averting his gaze. Spock watched him raise his hand to rub over his eyes. When he looked up again, they were rather shinier than before.<br><br>\n\u201cI missed his funeral.\u201d His voice was rough as he stated this fact.<br><br>\nSuddenly faced with the task of handling Kirk\u2019s delicate emotional state, Spock thought of which treatment his mother preferred in situations of emotional upheaval and knew it was a comforting touch.<br><br>\nComing to a quick decision, Spock leaned over the chessboard to clasp Kirk\u2019s left wrist and squeezed it briefly. It was an intimate gesture which offered him a glimpse of Kirk\u2019s genuine grief. But after shaking the man from a nightmare and repeatedly soothing his fears in the hospital, it did not seem inappropriate to take part in his emotions like this.<br><br>\n\u201cI grieve with thee,\u201d Spock said quietly before he let go, losing the connection.<br><br>\nWhen Kirk gave him a small smile and a grateful nod, Spock knew it had been the right thing to do, no matter his own discomfort.<br><br>\nThey resumed their game, speaking no further. Spock won much too easily.<br></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nIt only occurred to Spock the next morning that he had never asked Kirk about the purpose of the Council meeting. As it turned out, reading over the latest announcements of the Vulcan Information Distributing Agency on his PADD was a similarly effective method.<br><br>\nIt took Spock the impossible amount of 6.4 seconds to make sense of the sober headline: <tt>The Honorable James Tiberius Kirk receives Vulcan citizenship status</tt>.<br><br>\nWhen he caught himself, Spock went over the clues in his head and nodded to himself. The conclusion was logical, as was the decision of the Council. As Vulcan would no longer exist had it not been for Jim Kirk\u2019s actions, it was only proper to make him part of the Vulcan people and thus promise protection and support in return.<br><br>\nStill, Spock could not help but be unsettled by this revelation. Vulcans were not known for welcoming outworlders with open arms. Spock\u2019s own mother had needed years of assimilation until she had felt reasonably accepted. He himself had been alienated due to his mixed heritage for most of his life. Now, the Council openly proclaimed that a Human was part of their people.<br><br>\nSpock could not account for the bitter taste on the back of his tongue.<br><br>\nBreakfast commenced with both Sarek and Amanda offering their congratulations to Jim, who nodded and responded with a small smile before taking an inadvisably large swallow of his tea and promptly letting out a wet cough.<br><br>\n\u201cI, too, welcome you to our people,\u201d Spock said formally. It was clear Jim avoided his gaze as he quietly expressed his gratitude.<br><br>\n\u201cAm I correct in assuming that the Council provided you with the teachings of Surak, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d Sarek inquired.<br><br>\n\u201cYes, <em>kevet-dutar</em>, they have. I\u2019ll make sure to read them carefully.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou are, of course, not expected to follow the teachings,\u201d Spock pointed out. \u201cIn fact, there have always been certain groups of Vulcans that do not follow Surak and his pursuit of logic.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThere have?\u201d Kirk sounded honestly interested.<br><br>\n\u201cThey are few, and of no consequence,\u201d Sarek interfered, throwing Spock a significant look. Spock wondered if it was illogical to assume that there was nothing he could say or do that would not result in his father\u2019s open disapproval.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019d still like to know more,\u201d Kirk said carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s not often you hear about Vulcans who reject Surak\u2019s teachings.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd does Jim not, now that he is part of the Vulcan people himself, have the right to know all about our society?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSpock\u2019s logic seems sound to me.\u201d It was obvious Amanda was hiding a smile behind her cup of tea as she addressed her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that Jim would like to know as much as possible about his newly acquired home.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock quelled a childish urge to touch his mother\u2019s hand and convey his high esteem for her through their familial bond.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d His father\u2019s voice sounded off in a way that even Kirk seemed to notice, if his raised eyebrows and strange look were any indication.<br><br>\n\u201cIf you would like, I can provide you with access to our historical databases,\u201d Spock continued. \u201cThis way, you can trace the spread of Surak\u2019s teachings on logic from its very beginning.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d<br><br>\nAfter breakfast, Spock led Jim to the family computer panel where he had previously conversed with friends on Earth. Bringing a second chair, Spock sat and showed Kirk how to access the databanks and switch them to Federation Standard for his convenience.<br><br>\nHe was just about to excuse himself and leave Kirk to his studies when an incoming communication interrupted them. Spock did not recognize the ID except that the caller currently resided on Earth, but Kirk clearly was better informed.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bones!\u201d Kirk sounded genuinely happy as he gently pushed Spock aside to accept the call with a few touches to the panel.<br><br>\nThe doctor appeared on the screen, looking as disgruntled as Spock had got to know him during their rescue mission. \u201cHey, Jim,\u201d he said with the smallest of smiles, then nodded towards Spock. \u201cHello, Commander.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDoctor,\u201d Spock returned the greeting before getting up.<br><br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave,\u201d Jim told him, bright smile still in place. Carefully, Spock sat back down.<br><br>\n\u201cThis won\u2019t take long anyway,\u201d Dr. McCoy continued. \u201cI actually expected to just leave a message and have Jim call me back, but I guess I have good timing.\u201d<br><br>\nJim was back to looking up at the screen. \u201cHow are you?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cFine, kid. What is this I hear about you and Vulcan citizenship?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah.\u201d It sounded like a sigh to Spock\u2019s ears. Kirk\u2019s smile turned significantly less bright as he said it. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cFirst the ear, now this. When are you gonna go all logical on me and bleed green?\u201d<br><br>\nKirk\u2019s grin returned and he actually laughed out loud. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, Bones.\u201d He threw Spock a glance, blue eyes shining brightly with amusement. \u201cSorry, Spock.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI doubt the latter is medically possible,\u201d he replied carefully, unsure why Kirk was apologizing. Kirk only laughed again before turning his smile back on Dr. McCoy.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat is it, Bones?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m actually in between shifts, so I\u2019m going to keep this brief,\u201d Dr. McCoy said. \u201cI talked to the brass and they strongly advise you to stay put for a little longer.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh.\u201d Kirk sat up very straight, throwing Spock a quick look, which Spock could not quite interpret but seemed distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cAbout that--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThere is a ship coming by pretty soon, though, in case you\u2019re going to disregard the advice of your betters, as usual,\u201d Dr. McCoy continued without a pause, clearly not aware of his friend\u2019s discomfort.<br><br>\nSpock noted the signs of fatigue around his eyes. It was clear the doctor was not getting enough rest at night. It was likely he was still picking up shifts for the doctors that had died in battle. Otherwise, the doctor certainly would have noticed the small shake of Kirk\u2019s head as he continued talking.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s the <em>Pegasus</em> and they\u2019re actually going into orbit around Vulcan fairly soon to return Vulcan diplomatic staff to the planet. It all depends on when their mission wraps up. Either way, if you wanna leave early, contact Captain Li\u00e1ng. She\u2019s been informed you might want to hop on.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock suppressed the urge to ask Kirk the meaning of this. It was clear he was unhappy that Spock had been present for this conversation after all.<br><br>\n\u201cAnd now, I\u2019m going to go back to the hospital. If you need anything else, please call me-- oh, about never, because that is actually when I\u2019ll have my next day off from what I\u2019ve been given to understand.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThanks for your help. Bye, Bones,\u201d Kirk said tightly as Dr. McCoy gave a little wave.<br><br>\n\u201cKeep your chin up, kid.\u201d<br><br>\nAs the call disconnected, Kirk let out a deep sigh before looking Spock right in the face.<br><br>\n\u201cYou have made arrangements to leave Vulcan,\u201d Spock said when Kirk offered no explanation of his own.<br><br>\n\u201cI did kind of tell you,\u201d Kirk replied, but did not sound confident.<br><br>\nSpock inclined his head. \u201cIt is of course your choice alone if you wish to leave Vulcan. You are not required to stay for any amount of time.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk quirked his lips. \u201cBut?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBut: As a citizen of Vulcan, you should now no longer be uncomfortable about receiving your care here. Additionally, it is likely the Elders would not see the logic behind your actions and take offense to your leaving this early with your recuperation process not yet finished. Just yesterday, you suffered a great setback due to Selek\u2019s actions. Like the admiralty, I can only advise you not to leave unless your state of health has improved and travelling will no longer be a hardship for you.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk let out a very long sigh, rubbing a hand over his face for 10.8 seconds before letting his shoulders sag.<br><br>\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to stay then.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI wish to make it clear once more that it is no inconvenience to my family to house you. Quite on the contrary, it is seen as a great honor to our clan to provide you with board and lodging.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThanks, Spock. I didn\u2019t want to imply that I was unhappy with my stay here. I only \u2026 well \u2026\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded in understanding. \u201cYou are not entirely comfortable. It is understandable, as there are no family ties binding you to my clan. We will aspire not to make you feel like a stranger in our house.\u201d<br><br>\nKirk raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou mean, I should feel like part of the family?\u201d<br><br>\nThat was-- not what Spock had had in mind, exactly. But now that Kirk had voiced the thought, Spock could not reject the statement without giving offense. Additionally, it was clear Spock\u2019s mother had already developed a deep fondness for Kirk. Where she was concerned, Kirk\u2019s statement certainly applied.<br><br>\n\u201cYes,\u201d Spock replied and Kirk smiled, eyes crinkling with fondness. Spock wished he did not have to admit to himself that it affected him, but as he had previously accepted, it was clear that he cared about Kirk\u2019s well-being and wanted to see him content.<br><br>\n\u201cIf that is all, I will leave you to your studies.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Spock\u2019s mother said as she tended to one of her more delicate cacti in her garden. \u201cIt\u2019s been a week and Jim has still not been going out due to the heat, so why don\u2019t you show him some things that don\u2019t require him to be outside for too long?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhat places of interest did you have in mind?\u201d He offered her an arm as she got up from her knees. Instead of taking hold of his sleeved forearm, she took his bare hand with a smile. Spock could feel her affection through their touch and allowed himself to prolong the connection for a few moments longer before letting go.<br><br>\n\u201cYour former school in Shi\u2019Khar, for instance. I doubt he\u2019s seen anything like it before, and it\u2019s reasonably cool down where the learning pods are.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is an idea with some merit,\u201d Spock conceded and Amanda brushed her hand over Spock\u2019s once more, sending a wave of approval.<br><br>\nSpock had noticed that his mother had returned to behaving much more Human now that Kirk was living with them. She had never aspired to be like a Vulcan, but made an effort to accommodate her husband\u2019s people. Now, she was back to wide smiles and showing her affection much more openly.<br><br>\n\u201cIs he making much progress with meditation?\u201d Amanda asked as they returned inside together.<br><br>\n\u201cHe has voiced frustration over his failure to master the breathing techniques for more than a few minutes.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThey do require a great measure of patience. Maybe he\u2019s just too preoccupied to find that place where he can stop thinking things over. He\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d The concern for Kirk was very evident in her voice.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Spock asked her.<br><br>\n\u201cInstead of a Human therapist?\u201d she returned evenly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guide him?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock came to an abrupt halt. \u201cMother,\u201d he said, more than surprised by her suggestion.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou speak of a very intimate procedure,\u201d Spock told her. The mere thought of melding with Kirk and guiding his mind -- Spock sincerely hoped he was not displaying his embarrassment.<br><br>\n\u201cYou two are very close.\u201d She was tilting her head to the side as she looked up at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock blinked. \u201cHow have you come to that conclusion?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cBeside the fact that it\u2019s nearly impossible to talk to one of you without the other one nearby?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI am Mr. Kirk\u2019s caretaker,\u201d Spock replied, shifting where he stood and immediately regretting his action as it betrayed discomfort. \u201cIt is only logical to remain at his side and assure his well-being.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cLogical. Mr. Kirk,\u201d Amanda repeated, her face going soft in that way that filled Spock\u2019s chest with warmth, in spite of his best efforts to remain unaffected. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put up fronts with me, Spock. It\u2019s okay to say that you\u2019re fond of him, you know?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cFond of--? Mother, please cease speaking in this manner at once.\u201d Spock made a point of lacing his fingers behind his back, trying to regain some sort of control on the conversation. \u201cIt is not appropriate to speak this way.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cPropriety? That is what you\u2019re concerned with?\u201d She shook her head, frowning up at him. \u201cI know you and your father have a hard time acknowledging this, but you\u2019re very much alike. Might I remind you that he went against the explicit wishes of T\u2019Pau when he bonded with me? What you\u2019re feeling for Jim--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI am not \u2018feeling\u2019 anything for Jim,\u201d Spock returned harshly, cutting her off. \u201cMy high regard for him as a person is based on his honorable actions for our people. If you will not stop speaking in this irrational manner, I will have to end our conversation until you find reason again.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda narrowed her eyes at this. Spock had to fight an urge to swallow in the face of her sudden anger.<br><br>\n\u201cI know you have chosen the Vulcan way, but even a Vulcan feels,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable admitting that you care for Jim, it\u2019s one thing, but don\u2019t pretend with me and tell me you do not have emotions. You\u2019re not immune to feeling affection.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock stared at her. \u201cAffection?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYes, affection. I have seen how you look at him during your chess games, I have seen your face when he was suffering from the meld.\u201d She paused, stepping up to him. Her voice softened when she continued. \u201cSpock, you\u2019re my son. I know you and I know how deeply you feel. I realize you\u2019ve come to think of your feelings as something shameful, something to be purged. I know you\u2019ve got this desire to prove yourself more-than-Vulcan due to your mixed heritage, but you must not let this come between you and happiness.\u201d<br><br>\nStruck absolutely speechless, Spock could not move as his mother stroked his cheek.<br><br>\n\u201cEarth has been so good for your,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how happy it made me when you made friends. For a while, I was even sure you and that lovely girl Nyota would end up together, you know?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock only stared at her, feeling her warm hand against his cheek, waves of affection and even a hint of sadness lapping at his mental shields.<br><br>\n\u201cPlease think this over,\u201d she finally said, removing her hand. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see you unhappy.\u201d<br><br>\nWith that, she turned and walked away, leaving Spock to stand in the hallway and grasp for a logical thought</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cThis is where you studied as a child?\u201d Kirk sounded deeply impressed as they passed the learning pods, filled with hundreds of children processing information, taking tests or interrupting their learning process to talk to an instructor.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Spock observed the room he had not entered for over a decade.<br><br>\nOne or two of the instructors nodded respectfully at them as they passed. Although Spock knew them, he was sure the gesture was aimed at Kirk, not himself. His teachers had never forgiven him for his violent outbursts as a child, that much he knew for certain.<br><br>\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much input you Vulcans can handle at once,\u201d Kirk continued as he stopped by a pod, watching a young girl solve mathematical equations with her hands while reciting an ancient Vulcan poem.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is no hardship for most Vulcans, once the skill has been properly trained.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock observed as the first pods went offline, the more advanced children having finished early. They did not leave for their mid-day meal, but gathered around one of the dark pods, clearly whispering among each other as they threw glances in their direction.<br><br>\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Kirk said quietly as the children moved and approached them. \u201cAn ambush.\u201d<br><br>\nBefore Spock could reply, six children of approximately eight years of age had surrounded Kirk and himself, raising their small hands in the <em>ta\u2019al</em>.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Dif-tor heh smusma</em>,\u201d they chorused dutifully.<br><br>\nSpock merely nodded at the children, being the older party, but Kirk leaned down, presenting the children with a short but bright smile before he returned the greeting more seriously.<br><br>\n\u201cWe are eager to meet you, <em>oveh</em>,\u201d the girl in the very front spoke up. The intonation of her speech was not quite right, sounding much more Vulcan than Terran. \u201cI am T\u2019Karik and I have been chosen as speaker because I have the highest scores in Federation Standard.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cA logical choice,\u201d Kirk replied.<br><br>\nT\u2019Karik and the others looked at each other, their pride evident in their eyes. Unlike grown Vulcans, these children could not fully control their emotions yet, although to a Human like Kirk they had to look quite serious nevertheless.<br><br>\nAt once, his mother\u2019s words came to the front of Spock\u2019s mind when he noticed Kirk\u2019s easy charm as he talked to the children, answering questions about Earth and asking about their schooling in return. His eyes seemed to dance along as he outlined his explanations with his hands and the children were clearly intrigued by him and his manner of speaking.<br><br>\nOf course Kirk was very attractive for Human standards, and even a Vulcan could not deny the even proportions of his body and face, now slightly altered due to his remodelled left ear. Additionally, there was also something in the way he moved and held himself that was fascinating. His face was very expressive, even compared to other Terrans, offering bright smiles as openly as honest despair.<br><br>\nSpock shook his head ever so slightly. Surely, his mother must have been mistaken. Rationally approaching the question of Kirk\u2019s attractiveness and actually seeing in him a potential mate were two quite separate things, were they not?<br><br>\nMore and more children gathered as their learning sessions ended. Soon, 37 children were blocking the main pathway towards the exit as they listened avidly to Kirk\u2019s description of his own schooling in Iowa. While he did well when talking to Vulcan adults, he seemed to have a hard time reigning in his smiles with the children and his eyebrows rose and fell as he emphasised parts of his tales with broad gestures of his arms and hands. At one point, he let out a short but bellowing laugh that made some of the children whisper to each other as they watched him with wide, curious eyes.<br><br>\n\u201cYou are all late for your mid-day meal, <em>orensu</em>.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock stiffened as he recognized the sharp voice. He turned to take in the form of S\u2019lovan, one of Spock\u2019s own former teachers. He had not changed but for strands of grey and white added to his dark hair and the stern wrinkles deepened around his eyes.<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, <em>osa-su</em>,\u201d Kirk immediately replied as he straightened up. The smile on his face had ebbed away and he seemed to aim to position himself before the children as if to defend them.<br><br>\nS\u2019lovan regarded Kirk silently for several seconds and for a moment, Spock was reminded of one of the many times when this very teacher had looked at him this way: <em>Pafam-t'san s'at.</em><em>You are a disgrace for the Vulcan race, Spock.</em><br><br>\nAfter precisely 12.8 seconds, S\u2019lovan inclined his head. \u201c<em>Oveh</em>. It is an honor you are visiting our school.\u201d He looked past Kirk\u2019s shoulder and at the children. \u201cYou have eighteen Standard minutes left to proceed and have your mid-day meal, <em>orensu</em>. No exceptions will be made for you. I expect you back precisely on time, as always.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Ha, osavensu.</em>\u201d A wave of swift <em>ta\u2019al</em> for Kirk, and the children hurried away, talking to each other in low voices.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for holding them up,\u201d Kirk said to S\u2019lovan.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is important for children to grow up in discipline and order, as it is vital for living with logic as Surak has taught us.\u201d Spock did not miss the brief look S\u2019lovan threw at him. \u201cNevertheless, I realize you aimed to provide them with useful information about your homeworld. The pursuit of knowledge and inspiring it in others is always to be commended.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThey did seem to benefit from it,\u201d Kirk replied. Spock knew him well enough to hear him struggle for an expression other than <em>enjoy</em> or <em>have fun</em>. \u201cI take it they do not often have outworlders as instructors?\u201d<br><br>\nS\u2019lovan gave a stiff nod. \u201cAll instructors are indeed Vulcan, <em>oveh</em>. Foreign influence has proven to disrupt the learning process.\u201d<br><br>\nThis time, S\u2019lovan looked at Spock so openly that Kirk noticed it as well. His eyes narrowed.<br><br>\n\u201cYou have tried implementing instructors from other planets?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNot as such, <em>oveh</em>.\u201d A pause. \u201cMaybe, your caretaker can provide you with additional information on this topic. If you will excuse me, I will make sure the children are following their schedule.\u201d With a curt nod, he was gone.<br><br>\nKirk let out a harsh breath. \u201cWhat a dick,\u201d he hissed.<br><br>\nSpock actually flinched where he stood. \u201cMr. Kirk--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jim. And I\u2019m not taking it back. I knew Vulcans had some xenophobic tendencies, but did he really just imply you were a \u2018disruptive foreign influence\u2019 in school due to your mixed heritage?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI did not fit in easily with the other children,\u201d Spock admitted quietly.<br><br>\n\u201cSo? It\u2019s the teacher\u2019s responsibility to make sure you are not singled out instead of actively supporting the alienation.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock was surprised at the sudden fervency of Kirk\u2019s defense. \u201cHis criticism is not without base,\u201d he tried to elaborate, but Kirk was shaking his head.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, you\u2019re one of the most intelligent, logical and kind people I know. Plus, I have met your mother. I cannot imagine you to be anything less than an exemplary student. If you ended up making trouble in school, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t your fault alone.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYour high opinion honors me,\u201d Spock replied stiffly.<br><br>\nKirk smiled up at him, smoothing the angry creases in his face. A hand settled briefly on his shoulder, squeezing it. \u201cSorry you had to deal with this as a kid. You deserve much better.\u201d<br><br>\nBefore Spock could react, Kirk had already let go and turned way. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going to show me around some more or what?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock could not find a logical explanation for the sudden heat in his cheeks.</p>\n<p>The nightmares had been getting steadily more realistic. Now that his body had mostly recuperated from its more serious injuries, his mind was apparently content to throw at him everything that had happened on Nero\u2019s ship in stunning detail.<br><br>\nEach night, Jim awoke tangled in his blanket, trembling and covered in sweat after reliving being cut, beaten, shocked and laughed at. Twice, he had wet the bed as well and both of those times, he had fervently hoped not to meet anybody, least of all Sarek, in the hallway as he discarded the sheets in the laundry and retrieved a new set.<br><br>\nIt was fortunate that his nightmares had been mostly silent. At least, nobody seemed to wake with him or came to look after him like Spock had done on his first night here.<br><br>\nThis night was different again, however. Or at least, that was what Jim gathered from coming to his senses on the floor next to the bed with his heart beating heavily in his chest and Spock hovering over him. His hands were curled around Jim\u2019s upper arms, firm as manacles as they held him down. His lower lip was split, thick green blood making its way down his chin, his robes torn at the seams by his shoulders.<br><br>\n\u201cShit,\u201d Jim whispered involuntarily. His voice sounded brittle and his throat felt like sandpaper.<br><br>\n\u201cCan I let go now, or will you attack me again?\u201d In contrast, Spock sounded almost completely calm, though his messed up bangs spoke a different story.<br><br>\n\u201cShit,\u201d Jim repeated. \u201cYeah, you can let go.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock uncurled his hand and Jim finally realized that he had touched bare skin, undoubtedly getting a good taste of the irrational fear still shaking his body.<br><br>\n\u201cCrap, Spock, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jim rasped as he sat up. He rubbed over the spots where Spock had grabbed him, which were throbbing in tact with his racing heart now that the pressure was gone. Spock\u2019s eyes zeroed in on the movement immediately.<br><br>\n\u201cI grabbed you too harshly,\u201d he said and Jim knew him well enough by now to hear the regret in his voice. \u201cA Human fearing for his life is surprisingly strong and I had trouble estimating an appropriate physical response. I apologize.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, apparently I split your lip, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re even.\u201d<br><br>\nRaising an eyebrow in surprise, Spock lifted a hand to his mouth, regarding the sticky green on his fingers. \u201cI did not realize you had managed to hit me.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMe either,\u201d Jim said, rubbing a hand over his face. Fuck, what in hell was wrong with him?<br><br>\n\u201cI am quite aware you were not yourself.\u201d Spock stood, then offered an arm to Jim.<br><br>\nJim made a point of grabbing the sleeved part of Spock\u2019s arm, although it was probably pointless. Spock had already born the full brunt of Jim\u2019s volatile emotions if he had to hold him down with bare hands.<br><br>\nWhen he stood, Jim\u2019s shaky legs forced him to sit down on the bed quickly. A glance towards his lap revealed that at least he hadn\u2019t pissed himself this time.<br><br>\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that you are again suffering from nightmares,\u201d Spock said and, to Jim\u2019s surprise, sat down next to him on the messy bed, nearly close enough to brush their shoulders together. \u201cI had thought it would have passed now that you are acclimatized to your room.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Jim trailed off, but Spock clearly got the message.<br><br>\nHe pursed his lips in obvious disapproval, causing more blood to run from the split. \u201cYou have been having them every night, have you not?\u201d Almost casually, he brushed away the fresh blood, clearly too focused on Jim to bother much with it. \u201cNightmares of this intensity?\u201d<br><br>\nFeeling too shaky to lie, Jim just nodded. \u201cYeah. No screaming, though.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou did not think it wise to inform me or a healer of your troubles?\u201d<br><br>\nJim had no reply to that. What could he say? Spock already knew Jim didn\u2019t want to bother him, didn\u2019t want to bother anyone. He\u2019d be fine once he was back on Earth. Maybe Bones could slip him some therapy so he could get right back to work. Didn\u2019t he have a minor in psychology or something?<br><br>\nA cool hand curled around his wrist. Startled out his straying thoughts, Jim stared down at the contact, then up at Spock, who was quite pointedly not letting go.<br><br>\n\u201cJim,\u201d he said very seriously. \u201cIt is not healthy to experience these kinds of nightmares every night.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly asking for them, Spock,\u201d Jim snapped.<br><br>\nSpock did not seem offended. \u201cYou misunderstand me,\u201d he replied quietly. \u201cI meant to offer you my assistance.\u201d<br><br>\nJim snorted humorlessly. \u201cWell, the breathing thing isn\u2019t helping much.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock tilted his head. \u201cYes, I can see that the <em>tu-lan</em> is not assisting you in clearing your mind. Therefore, I have a different proposition to make. It would, however, be quite \u2026 invasive.\u201d Still, he was not letting go of Jim\u2019s wrist.<br><br>\nJim swallowed, trying to get rid of the scratchy feeling in his throat. \u201cInvasive?\u201d he asked.<br><br>\nSpock nodded. \u201cYes. I would act as your <em>pihlora</em>, your guide in meditation.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSo we\u2019d meld?\u201d Jim could not help but be reminded of the pain and nausea the older Spock had caused him.<br><br>\nSpock must have felt his spiking anxiety through the touch, as he hurried to explain: \u201cIt would not be like your meld with the Elder Selek. Unlike him, I am not emotionally compromised. Also, I will not add memories to your mind, but rather guide you to settle the thoughts and emotions already in place.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cStill, it would be a rather personal affair, as I would be partly aware of your thoughts.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jim said. That did sound more than a little invasive.<br><br>\n\u201cYour throat sounds sore,\u201d Spock observed. \u201cI shall fetch you something to drink. You may use the time to think over my proposal. You might find that you have questions.\u201d His fingers tightened briefly around Jim\u2019s wrist before letting go. \u201cI will return shortly.\u201d<br><br>\nJim looked after him, feeling slightly overwhelmed as well as shaken up. Melding -- with Spock?<br><br>\nIt wasn\u2019t like he didn\u2019t trust him. He trusted him a whole lot. Too much almost. And he genuinely liked him, too. It had not passed Jim by how much he cherished Spock\u2019s company, how enjoyable it was to talk to him. He usually did his best to simply ignore the little crush he had been harboring for the past weeks.<br><br>\nLetting out a shaky sigh, Jim let himself fall back onto the mattress, legs dangling off loosely at the edge. God, he was a mess.<br><br>\nThe mind meld with the older Spock had shaken him deeply. He still found himself remembering things that had nothing to do with explaining Nero\u2019s presence in this universe, things he knew he had not experienced -- seeing an older, slightly different version of himself in the captain\u2019s chair or setting foot on planets he knew he had never visited. He honestly did not want his mind to have to deal with yet another intrusion.<br><br>\nBut Spock had said this would be different. Something to bring order into the chaos. Maybe, he could even help Jim with getting rid of the strange memories. Or repress them. Something like that, surely.<br><br>\nRealizing that he had already made up his mind, Jim let his eyes drift shut until Spock returned. He had taken care of the split in his lip and ordered his hair, but his night robes were still torn at the shoulders.<br><br>\nSitting up once more, Jim gratefully accepted the glass of water provided to him. It was not cold, but it had the earthy taste water seemed to acquire naturally on Vulcan. He downed it in one go, then nodded to himself.<br><br>\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d he said firmly, looking at Spock.<br><br>\n\u201cYou speak of me acting as your <em>pihlora</em>?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYes. My mind\u2019s a mess and as long as I\u2019m not on Earth, I might as well try a Vulcan form of therapy, right?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is not precisely--\u201d Spock started, but Jim shook his head.<br><br>\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I get it.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is also not a decision to make lightly,\u201d Spock reminded him seriously. \u201cYou have ample time to form a final opinion on the matter.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell, I trust you now.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock blinked at him, clearly taking his time to let that sink in. \u201cYou honor me,\u201d he finally said.<br><br>\nFeeling distinctly uncomfortable with the look on Spock\u2019s face, Jim hurried to say: \u201cSo, let\u2019s just try it.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNow?\u201d Spock raised his eyebrows.<br><br>\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br><br>\nSpock shook his head. \u201cYou are too unsettled. As am I.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cDamn, okay. Um, sorry about,\u201d Jim said, making a vague gesture towards Spock\u2019s head, \u201cmessing with your mind, too.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt was of my own free choice. In addition, my mental shields are adequate and able to forestall any serious damage to my mental composure.\u201d<br><br>\nJim nodded. God, he was tired. As he was still covered in cold sweat though, a shower was non-negotiable. \u201cI\u2019ll freshen up then, and try to sleep some more.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cA logical decision.\u201d Spock stood, taking the empty glass from Jim. \u201cI hope you rest well, in spite of your troubles.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cThanks, Spock.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAfter breakfast, if you are amenable, you may come to my room and I will attempt to guide your mind.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br><br>\nFor a moment, it looked like Spock wanted to say something more, but then he turned and left without another word, letting the door slide shut behind him</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cYou will need to relax,\u201d said Spock for the fifth time.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d And he really was. But every time Spock raised his hand and came anywhere near his face, Jim was reminded of the other Spock and inevitably flinched back.<br><br>\n\u201cDid you not say that you trusted me?\u201d<br><br>\nJim also knew Spock wasn\u2019t trying to guilt-trip him -- there probably wasn\u2019t even a word for it in Golic -- but it didn\u2019t fucking help that it sounded like he was.<br><br>\n\u201cI do,\u201d Jim insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s just-- um, you know. Kind of freaked out because of last time.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock folded his hands neatly in his lap. \u201cIf you believe you are unable to do this due to your prior experience, we can of course stop trying.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jim shook his head. \u201cI want to try. Really. Do you think I don\u2019t want to get better? I\u2019m about done with feeling like crap every morning, you know?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI see,\u201d Spock said. \u201cIn that case, you will need to--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cRelax! I know. Just \u2026 give me a minute, okay?\u201d<br><br>\nClosing his eyes, Jim took several deep breaths. It took him a few moments to realize that he unconsciously had chosen the pattern of the technique Spock had taught him. He could still not achieve the floating sensation for any great amount of time, but it did help calm his pulse and relax his muscles -- if he wasn\u2019t attempting the awkward meditation position, that is. Luckily, Spock had told him that a comfortable cross-legged position would be more practical for the meld.<br><br>\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he finally breathed out after a few minutes had passed. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded, taking a deep breath of his own. Slowly, carefully, he raised his hand and it approached Jim, who involuntarily tensed. But he would not flinch. He would not.<br><br>\nAnd then, finally, Spock\u2019s fingers connected with his face, instantly finding the right pattern. He murmured something in Vulcan and then--<br><br>\nIt was completely different to the other meld. Spock\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t a brunt force dumping information, but more like a warm wave, lapping over rough edges and blunt ends, smoothing them over. Jim felt like he was sinking, drowning in Spock\u2019s presence without the fear of choking on it.<br><br>\nHe had no exact idea what it was that Spock was doing. Every once in a while, a memory of Nero torturing him would slip up, like a memory suddenly triggered by a smell, sound or picture, but Jim felt detached, like he was seeing it through a filter taking away all emotions and associations attached to it.<br><br>\nMostly, he reveled in the feeling of being so intimately close to somebody else. He did not feel or see any of Spock\u2019s distinct thoughts and memories, but he was a warm and soothing presence in his mind. It hardly felt invasive to have him there, though rationally, it was.<br><br>\nWhen Spock finally drew back, Jim had no idea how much time had passed. All he knew was that he felt better. Quieter. Calmer. He knew he was smiling blissfully when he opened his eyes, feeling simply good in a way he had not experienced in a while.<br><br>\nThe same could not be said for Spock, whose hand was trembling as he returned it to his lap. He was visibly affected by the whole affair. Jim had never seen him like this. His face was tense, wrinkles of pain or discomfort edged around his eyes and mouth.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, are you okay?\u201d Jim asked immediately, worry clogging up his own voice.<br><br>\n\u201cI am,\u201d Spock said, but his voice was also shaking, and that had never happened before when Jim was around.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Has my mind hurt you or something?\u201d Jim instantly felt sick at the thought. Spock had gone through some pretty graphic memories of torture. Damn. Jim should have thought about this before giving his consent.<br><br>\n\u201cI merely require meditation of my own,\u201d Spock replied. He looked even paler than usual, clearly not a good sign.<br><br>\n\u201cShould I fetch somebody? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNo!\u201d Spock snapped. And wow, he had never sounded this upset before. He took another deep breath, averting his gaze from Jim\u2019s entirely as he spoke up again: \u201cI apologize for my harsh tone. All I require at the moment is solitude.\u201d<br><br>\nJim hurried to get to his feet. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, okay. Sorry. I\u2019ll leave.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock did not react. He adjusted his own posture to a complex meditative position and closed his eyes. But instead of looking collected and calm, his eyelids twitched and his shoulders were tense. Jim hurried to leave.<br><br>\nOutside Spock\u2019s room, Jim took a deep breath and ran a hand over his face. Damn. He hoped he hadn\u2019t traumatized Spock in the meld or something. He had seemed so confident when he had explained it to Jim, he hadn\u2019t even thought something could go wrong. Certainly, he had never thought it could impact Spock negatively. He\u2019d only been worried for himself.<br><br>\n\u201cAre you quite well, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d<br><br>\nSarek\u2019s stern face appeared in Jim\u2019s line of vision. Well, crap. That\u2019s not who he wanted to talk to right now.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Kevet-dutar</em>,\u201d Jim managed. \u201cI\u2019m just fine, thank you.\u201d<br><br>\nAnd he really was, too. Underneath the worry for Spock, he felt calmer than he ever had since waking up in Shi\u2019Khar hospital. There was no trace of anger, fear or helplessness, at least not right now. Clearly, the meld had done some good, at least for himself.<br><br>\n\u201cYou do not look \u2018fine\u2019.\u201d Sarek threw a suspicious glance at the door to Spock\u2019s room. \u201cHas Spock done something to upset you?\u201d<br><br>\nJim vehemently shook his head. \u201cNo. God no, really. I think it was me who did something to him.\u201d The last thing Jim wanted to do now was get Spock into trouble with his father again.<br><br>\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d Sarek frowned the tiniest bit. \u201cAre you able to elaborate on that, <em>oveh</em>?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jim hesitated. He could hardly lie now. When Sarek asked Spock, he would surely tell him the truth anyway, what with Vulcans and their requisite honesty. Still, he had a feeling Sarek would not be amused. \u201cWe mind-melded.\u201d<br><br>\nFor the first time, Jim saw open surprise on Sarek\u2019s face. It clearly was not often the man lost his composure, undoubtedly a trait well-trained both by being a logic-abiding Vulcan and an ambassador.<br><br>\n\u201cYou melded?\u201d he repeated, the tips of his eyebrows disappearing behind the line of his bangs.<br><br>\n\u201cWe did. Spock thought it might help with my nightmares. He was acting as my <em>pihlora</em>, he said.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cAnd you deemed that wise, given what happened during and after the meld with his counterpart?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSpock is not Selek.\u201d Jim made a point of looking Sarek directly into the eyes. \u201cI trust him not to hurt me.\u201d<br><br>\nSarek acknowledged it with a curt nod. \u201cStill, the experience seems to have been upsetting to you.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cNot to me.\u201d Jim shook his head. \u201cI feel fine. But for Spock -- well. He wasn\u2019t doing so well when we ended the meld, <em>kevet-dutar</em>.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d It was plain their antagonistic relationship didn\u2019t go so far that Sarek no longer worried about his son\u2019s well-being when it really mattered.<br><br>\nJim had been uncomfortable leaving Spock in a state like this. Coming to a quick decision, Jim explained: \u201cWhen the meld was over, he was shaking. He insisted he was fine, but I don\u2019t think he was. He said he had to meditate.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIs that was he is doing now?\u201d Sarek asked, sending another glance at Spock\u2019s door. Yes, definitely worried.<br><br>\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s attempting to do, yeah,\u201d Jim said with emphasis.<br><br>\nSarek threw him another quick glance before looking back at the door. \u201cIn that case, if you will excuse me, <em>oveh</em>, I will see to my son\u2019s state myself.\u201d<br><br>\nJim watched him enter Spock\u2019s room with relief. So Spock wouldn\u2019t be on his own after this. Good. He could only hope it wouldn\u2019t end in another fight between the two Vulcans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nJim did not see Spock until dinner, where he kept silent and pointedly avoided Jim\u2019s gaze. Jim, however, was having none of it.<br><br>\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Spock?\u201d he asked as he was handed a bowl of turnip-like Vulcan vegetables by Amanda. \u201cYou look better, at least.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMy state of health is adequate,\u201d was his curt response, his eyes virtually glued to his plate.<br><br>\n\u201cI believe Mr. Kirk would benefit from you elaborating on that, Spock,\u201d Sarek said. \u201cHe was quite unsettled when I talked to him.\u201d<br><br>\nAmanda\u2019s eyes instantly narrowed in on the two of them, though she kept quiet as she filled her own plate, holding the slightly differently shaped Vulcan cutlery with practiced ease. Clearly, nobody had told her anything yet.<br><br>\n\u201cThere is nothing further to say, <em>osa-mekh</em>,\u201d Spock insisted.<br><br>\n\u201c<em>Sa-fu</em>,\u201d Sarek prompted. \u201cI deem it wise.\u201d<br><br>\nJim did not miss Amanda\u2019s incredulous stare at that pronouncement. Clearly, there was an undertone in this conversation Jim was unable to pick up on. But then, Amanda would know her husband and son much better than him.<br><br>\nSetting down his cutlery, Spock finally looked up, his face as blank as before the meld. \u201cI have once more settled my mind. I apologize for any worry I might have caused.\u201d His voice had sounded stiff until now, but it gentled when he asked: \u201cHave you benefited from the meld, Jim?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI have, I think. I feel much calmer. Less agitated.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock nodded, throwing his father a glance, possibly to see if he had fully satisfied his wish, before returning to his meal.<br><br>\nWhen Jim caught Amanda\u2019s eyes once more, she was looking at him pointedly, silently forming the word <em>Talk</em> before she, too, focused on her meal. Nobody said anything until the meal was over, but then Spock had recently explained to Jim that it was not usual for Vulcans to talk much while eating.<br><br>\nWhen the dishes were discarded in the cleaner, Jim found himself confronted by Amanda. Undoubtedly having years of practice as an ambassador\u2019s wife, she managed to steer Jim away from Sarek and Spock without being too obvious about it. They ended up on the deck overlooking Amanda\u2019s garden. As the sun was already setting, the heat wasn\u2019t too unbearable.<br><br>\nAmanda sat him down firmly on one of the seats in the shade. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cMe?\u201d Jim bristled, but Amanda was shaking her head.<br><br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean it like that. But -- Sarek and Spock. They\u2019re talking!\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYes?\u201d Jim was not sure he understood what Amanda was trying to say.<br><br>\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t notice? Oh, of course you wouldn\u2019t, why would you!\u201d She smiled at him as she adjusted her headscarf, tucking in some loose strings of hair. \u201cThey actually talked. Civilly. Sarek even called him <em>sa-fu</em>. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard him acknowledge Spock as his son in years.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh?\u201d Jim said. He was getting the idea now, at least he thought so.<br><br>\nQuickly, he explained to her what had transpired. Amanda nodded along, throwing in a brief comment or two to express her approval or surprise. She was clearly excited over the apparent improvement in Sarek\u2019s and Spock\u2019s relationship, though Jim could not quite understand how a single word could be seen as such a big step.<br><br>\nJim almost felt sorry for her. It must have been hard for her, seeing her only son and husband be so distant with each other for all these years, quietly trying to work through Vulcan resolve to bring them closer again.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad Spock took my advice,\u201d she said when Jim finished, smiling brightly at him. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t know it would affect him this much.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYou proposed the meld?\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI did. I thought it would help you,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen I had newly bonded with Sarek, I had troubles adjusting to our new connection. Sarek frequently helped me order my mind until it had settled.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh. But Spock and I aren\u2019t--\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Amanda interrupted him. \u201cBut you are rather close. And clearly, you\u2019ve benefitted from it, so that\u2019s good at least. I\u2019ll make sure Sarek tells me all about how Spock is doing.\u201d Again she smiled, then leaned over to pat Jim\u2019s arm. \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been trying to get them to mend things, and here you come and just push them into a room together. I knew you\u2019d be good for Spock. He\u2019s very fond of you, you know?\u201d<br><br>\nJim blinked at her, but she was already standing up. \u201cLet me talk to my husband now. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll try to be very Vulcan and secretive about the entire affair, but I\u2019ll get him to talk eventually.\u201d<br><br>\nShe winked at him and was gone, leaving Jim to sit in his chair, watching the Vulcan sun set as he chewed this strange conversation over.<br><br><em>You are rather close.</em> she had said. <em>I knew you\u2019d be good for Spock. He\u2019s very fond of you.</em><br><br>\nJim pressed a hand over his mouth, thinking. It was clear Spock had talked to her about him, and it wasn\u2019t the first time she had said that she thought them rather close. But had Spock let something more slip? Did he care about Jim more than he let on when they spent time together?<br><br>\nJim had already come to terms with the fact that he was sort of harboring a crush for the guy, but then he had put that down to an injured person having a thing for their caretaker. Especially if said caretaker looked like Spock, all lean muscle and dark hair. Nothing serious, certainly.<br><br>\nBut the meld had felt so comforting, so warm, almost safe. Like a cozy blanket. If Jim could, he\u2019d revisit the experience every day of his life. And if Spock also felt--<br><br>\nGod, no. Stop. This was ridiculous. He wasn\u2019t a fucking teenager. If there was something between them, surely it would manifest itself or simply die down. Those were the only possibilities, and staring at the sunset playing <em>does he, does he not</em> would most certainly not help.<br><br>\nJim shook his head at his own foolishness as he stood and returned to the house.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br>\nUnfortunately, Jim could not stop thinking about the revelations of that conversation now that the seed was sown. As Amanda kept insisting Jim had to go out and see things, especially now that he was at least slowly getting used to the heat, it gave Jim ample time to observe Spock, too.<br><br>\nSpock was not showing any signs of anything other than friendly regard for Jim, but then he was Vulcan. What did a Vulcan with a crush look like? Did they even do that, or was it more of a Surakian approach, weighing pros and cons and finding the ideal mate through calculations and logical precision?<br><br>\nJim knew the most intimate of things for Vulcans was touch, but unless he counted the few times Spock had touched him for caretaking reasons, Spock had only really sought out contact consciously once or twice. Neither of those touches had seemed overly intimate to Jim.<br><br>\nBut then, Amanda and Sarek were bonded, and Jim hardly saw them touch either. They occasionally shared a Vulcan kiss in front of him, a slow, tender brush of their fingers, but nothing that Jim would call very demonstrative.<br><br>\nSpock also always had a legitimate reason to be close by Jim. If it wasn\u2019t the same old caretaker fuss, he was showing Jim how the Vulcans had actually made use of Nero\u2019s drill hole to build a scientific research station closer to their planet\u2019s core, or they were playing chess, or he was asking if Jim about his nightmares and peace of mind. So it wasn\u2019t like Jim could really interpret that as a sign of interest either.<br><br>\nReally, Jim had no way of knowing anything for certain, and if Amanda hadn\u2019t given those vague hints, he\u2019d probably still be oblivious that there might be something going on between them.<br><br>\nSo maybe, it was up to him to approach things. He had done his fair share of flirting, with Aliens as much as with Humans, and he had been on Vulcan for long enough to have at least some idea of what it might entail.<br><br>\nIt felt awkward, but Jim was determined. One afternoon over chess, he brushed their fingers together a few times as if by accident as they set up the board. But besides a stiffening of his shoulders, Spock did not show any signs of having even noticed, let alone cared.<br><br>\nAnother afternoon, they were taking a shuttle back to Spock\u2019s home after a check-up at the hospital with T\u2019Lkai, and Jim made a point of brushing their legs together. Spock only briefly glanced at their connection before adjusting his leg and breaking the contact.<br><br>\nOne night, with Spock pointing out certain star constellations visible on Vulcan from the deck of his house, Jim sat very close to him, paying extra attention to everything he said and asking lots of questions. Spock had eventually retired to his room, not once commenting on Jim\u2019s behavior.<br><br>\nEither, Jim was being too subtle, or Amanda hadn\u2019t meant anything when she had mentioned Spock\u2019s particular fondness for him. Maybe, she had simply meant friendship, and Jim, still affected by the intimate connection of the meld, had interpreted it in a way that suited his own feelings. The meld had been something else. Warm. Soothing. All things good.<br><br>\nBut it wasn\u2019t like he was in love with Spock, so if he had been wrong, it certainly wasn\u2019t anything to waste too many thoughts over. It wasn\u2019t like he was in any state to pursue any sort of relationship, anyway, what with being a bed wetter in his twenties.<br><br>\nThe meld had helped with the nightmares, though. He was still having them, but he didn\u2019t wake up covered in sweat every night, and the dreams were less volatile and sometimes merged with fond or harmless memories, making it a far less scary experience.<br><br>\nJim doubted he was anywhere near healed or would pass a psych eval at Starfleet, but he was getting more sleep now, didn\u2019t have to change soiled sheets and just felt better all over. Even the Vulcan breathing thing worked better for him, now that he wasn\u2019t feeling so tired and restless all the time. If it weren\u2019t for the ever present heat and T\u2019Lkai insisting that he was not fully physically recuperated and sticking him with hypos whenever they went to the hospital, things would really be looking up.<br><br>\nMaybe, Jim might have let the whole thing drop and forced his little crush into oblivion when one afternoon, returning from yet another trip to Shi\u2019Khar, Selek hadn\u2019t been waiting for them at Spock\u2019s home.<br><br>\nHe was drinking a cup of spicy Vulcan tea as he made light conversation with Amanda. Spock came to an abrupt halt next to Jim as he saw him.<br><br>\nJim himself didn\u2019t quite know what to feel when he saw the Elder. He knew the older Spock hadn\u2019t meant to mess with his mind, but he had, and it hadn\u2019t been a pleasant experience. Still, it was clear from the strange memories in his head that this version of Spock and his Kirk had been close friends, much closer than Jim and his own version. Jim couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what it must have been like to see and talk to another version of a friend so dear. He certainly wouldn\u2019t know what to do when he encountered another Bones somewhere.<br><br>\n\u201cJim\u201d, the Elder said and stood, placing down his cup on the table. \u201cSpock.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cElder Selek,\u201d Spock returned stiffly. Jim noticed he was not presenting him with the <em>ta\u2019al</em> or bowing his head in greeting.<br><br>\nJim only nodded at Selek, feeling more than a little bit uncertain about the whole thing.<br><br>\n\u201cI had hoped I\u2019d be able to talk to you, Jim,\u201d Selek said. His voice sounded sad and even his face showed some emotion. Clearly, this version of Spock had come to embrace a bit of emotional expression at some point in his life. \u201cAbout what has transpired between us.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI do not deem that wise,\u201d Spock interfered before Jim could form any sort of reply. Jim glanced at him in surprise, but Spock\u2019s eyes were on his counterpart. \u201cThe last time you spoke to him, it greatly unsettled him and lead to severe mental disarray. It is only logical to assume another conversation will have similar consequences.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cLast time, I had not yet sought out the <em>kolinahru</em> to settle my mind. to settle my mind. Furthermore, I am not planning on initiating another mind meld.\u201d Selek\u2019s eyes settled on Jim. \u201cJim, I am very sorry I hurt you. It was not my intention.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI know,\u201d Jim managed. The older Spock sounded so regretful, Jim had a hard time staying mad at him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t know what would happen.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHe should have known,\u201d Spock retorted. Jim was surprised how harsh his voice sounded. \u201cHe was severely emotionally compromised ever since passing through the black hole alongside Nero. He should have known it would not be wise to meld, especially not with an untrained mind like yours.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSpock, I don\u2019t think--\u201d Jim said, but was interrupted by Selek.<br><br>\n\u201cSpock is correct,\u201d he said, sounding tired. \u201cI should have known. But seeing you before me, James Tiberius Kirk -- my dear friend. The temptation to know you again was too great.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cHe is not your James Kirk,\u201d Spock reminded him. \u201cHe is a completely different person who has lived another life entirely, thanks to your careless actions.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cSpock!\u201d That was Amanda, sounding honestly upset. \u201cYou\u2019re being rude.\u201d<br><br>\nSpock glanced at his mother, then inclined his head. \u201cI apologize,\u201d he said, but didn\u2019t sound the least bit sincere about it.<br><br>\nFeeling helpless in the face of Spock\u2019s reaction, Jim felt it would be best to separate the two of them before something worse might happen.<br><br>\n\u201cSelek,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to talk. In private.\u201d Jim sought out Amanda\u2019s eyes. She nodded and stepped up to Spock, taking him by the arm.<br><br>\n\u201cLet them talk it out, Spock,\u201d she said, gently guiding him away. \u201cIt\u2019s Jim\u2019s decision.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cI will be close by,\u201d Spock informed them before letting himself be pulled from the room.<br><br>\nThe following silence was awkward at best, with Selek staring at the spot where Spock had been with sad eyes.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean to blame you or anything,\u201d Jim finally tried to reassure him, grasping helplessly for something to say.<br><br>\nSelek shook his head. \u201cHe did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is of no consequence. He is not incorrect. It was my actions that brought chaos into this universe and changed the course of your lives.\u201d<br><br>\nUnsure how to refute that statement, Jim shrugged awkwardly. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wanted to talk?\u201d<br><br>\nSelek nodded. \u201cMainly to apologize to you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to ask after your state of health after what I have done.\u201d He gestured towards the seats and abandoned tea and they both sat down.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Jim said, summoning a smile. \u201cI mean, it wasn\u2019t pleasant, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d<br><br>\nSelek watched him carefully. \u201cI have been informed that more information has leaked through the meld than I had originally intended.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cYeah. I mean, I\u2019ve got all the stuff with Nero and the red matter, but there\u2019s also -- other things. You exploring space with my counterpart, mainly.\u201d<br><br>\nSelek let out a nearly inaudible sigh. \u201cI apologize for the additional transference,\u201d he said. \u201cI had not seen you for so long, my mind longed to reconnect with you. And when my mind found that you were different from what I knew, it tried to make up for you lack of memories by providing my own.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cOh,\u201d was all Jim managed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s fine.\u201d<br><br>\n\u201cIt is not \u2018fine\u2019, old friend,\u201d Selek said, shaking his head. \u201cBut then, neither is calling you that, is it? I must admit, I find myself running into difficulties in separating the people from my universe with the versions I meet here. It is not easy to realize that you look and sound so much like my James Kirk, but are not him.\u201d His voice sounded shaky. Brittle. Old.<br><br>\nAnd even though Jim was still somewhat angry at him, he could not help but feel sorry for the older Spock. It was clear he felt guilt and regret over what had happened, even though it was not his fault his mission to safe Romulus went this terribly wrong. This Spock -- he had to miss his friends, his family, and all he had now were caricatures of those he had known and cared for, taunting him with their false familiarity. With all that was different in this universe, it was clear they were far from the same people this Spock knew from his own timeline.<br><br>\nThe mind meld had been horrible, but Jim could understand. He really could. This Spock\u2019s mind had simply looked for a familiar touch, a friend. Following an instinct, he placed a careful hand on Selek\u2019s sleeved arm which was placed on the table between them.<br><br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said sincerely, \u201cfor your loss.\u201d<br><br>\nSelek\u2019s face was full of gratitude as he accepted the gesture. \u201cThank you, Jim. Your kindness is, as it seems, a constant in all timelines.\u201d<br><br>\nThey talked for a few more minutes. Selek asked about Jim\u2019s physical health, and Jim told him readily about the decreased hearing capacity of his pointed ear and the lasting numbness in his fingertips.<br><br>\nEventually, though, they were at a loss of what else to say and Selek stood, bidding his farewell.<br><br>\n\u201cIf you are amenable,\u201d he added, \u201cI would like to stay in contact. I would greatly appreciate if you would write to me, if only a few sentences as to how you are faring.\u201d<br><br>\nHe had to feel lonely, Jim thought as he agreed. Selek looked so grateful that Jim couldn\u2019t help himself and squeezed his arm once more, a gesture that seemed to mean much to him if the sheen in his eyes was anything to go by.</p>\n<p>When Selek approached Spock and his mother in the hallway, Spock had already regained most of his emotional composure.<br><br> Spock was not in the conscious habit of lying to himself. He knew exactly why he had reacted the way he had when they had encountered Selek. The Elder had proven himself a threat to Jim, and that was unacceptable now that Spock knew his mind. Jim had been hurt far too often in his life. Spock considered it his duty to protect him from any further harm.<br><br> \u201cI also wish to talk to you, Spock, if you are amenable,\u201d Selek said and Amanda excused herself at once, possibly unwilling to listen to another argument.<br><br> \u201cI can think of no benefits to be derived from such a conversation,\u201d Spock said coldly and turned towards the sitting room door, eager to seek out Jim and make sure he was faring well after this unexpected encounter.<br><br> \u201cIt is clear you now know his mind,\u201d Selek called after him.<br><br> Spock came to an abrupt halt, slowly turning back toward the Elder. \u201cElaborate.\u201d<br><br> Selek stepped closer, lowering his voice. \u201cThe manner in which you reacted when you talked to me earlier was ample proof. You are protective of Jim Kirk, almost ferociously so. It is clear your minds have touched.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI did not think it was so obvious,\u201d Spock admitted, albeit unwillingly.<br><br> Selek displayed a rather un-Vulcan smile. \u201cI have felt the very same protectiveness for decades. I know what it is like to love James Kirk.\u201d<br><br> Spock inhaled sharply. \u201cYou do not know of which you speak,\u201d he said tightly.<br><br> \u201cAn entirely illogical statement, although excused by your emotional involvement. Your minds have touched. You must have felt the obvious: How compatible your minds are. How well they fit together.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYes,\u201d Spock admitted. \u201cBut we are not bonded. There is no reason to speak of affection.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou could be bonded. Easily so.\u201d<br><br> Spock stared at him. \u201cYou are not making sense, Elder. I advise you to seek order for your mind through extensive meditation.\u201d<br><br> Selek only sighed, shaking his head. His gaze flitted towards the closed door to the sitting room where Jim was still residing. \u201cPlease do not repeat my mistakes and disregard that potential until it is too late.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou speak nonsense.\u201d<br><br> \u201cHear me out, Spock. It is illogical to deny that which is obviously true. Your minds are highly compatible, just as my mind was with that of my James Kirk. That connection-- it has great potential. I even believe that, had I acted on that which I knew to be true but denied nonetheless, my Jim and I could have become <em>t\u2019hy\u2019la</em>.\u201d<br><br> Spock stared at Selek. \u201cThere have been very few recorded <em>t\u2019hy\u2019la</em> bonds,\u201d he said tightly.<br><br> \u201cIndeed. But they have been the most stable, harmonious and fulfilling bonds ever to exist, and all of them have had at their heart a mental compatibility far exceeding the average between other satisfactorily bounded couples.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI do not think--\u201d<br><br> \u201cHave you not felt it?\u201d Selek pressed. \u201cTell me honestly. What did you encounter when you entered Jim\u2019s mind?\u201d<br><br> Spock could not reply immediately. Touching Jim\u2019s mind could not be described adequately in words. It had been like coming home after a long journey, but finding that home in chaos. It had felt like receiving that which you had long desired, only then realizing it was already slipping away from you again.<br><br> Spock had felt their compatibility, but he had also seen the chaos and hurt in Jim\u2019s mind. He had wanted nothing more than to soothe his fear and pains. He had spent far too long in the meld, far longer than he had planned or was accustomed to, taking utmost care to shield and protect Jim. He had soothed his mind, smoothed the harsh edges of the painful memories of torture and despair and made them fade into the background. There had been little actual guidance involved. Rather, it had been Spock taking care of Jim to the best of his abilities.<br><br> He had been deeply shaken when their minds had disconnected. In addition to the experience of Jim\u2019s volatile and traumatic memories, he was also fighting with the urge to reconnect with Jim immediately, to know all his thoughts, to ask him to give up all that was his and give his own mind in return. An illogical wish to forever wrap him up in his own mind and protect him from any possible harm.<br><br> It had taken his father\u2019s gentle guidance to bring order back into his own mind. Of course, it had also been inevitable that he find out what it was that Spock had seen and felt in Jim\u2019s mind. He had not voiced his thoughts on the matter, but Spock realized that Sarek, too, knew of the connection between Jim\u2019s and Spock\u2019s minds. One might even see their improved relationship since the incident as a sign of his approval.<br><br> \u201cI admit to feeling the compatibility of which you speak,\u201d Spock whispered shakily, averting his gaze.<br><br> \u201cPlease,\u201d Selek implored. \u201cDo not waste your opportunity like I have. Talk to Jim. Connect with him. Ask for a bond.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI am unsure he would welcome such an intimate connection. Besides, he is still recovering from a traumatic experience. This is not the right time.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThis is the right time,\u201d Selek insisted. There was an edge of desperation in his voice that made Spock look at him. His older self looked very Human just then: sad, defeated. \u201cThis Jim has little bonds, little family. And it is quite obvious that he is fond of you, even from the little interaction I have seen between you. Do you really not believe he would benefit from the stability of a mate? Thrive on the love you can offer?\u201d<br><br> \u201cLove,\u201d Spock repeated helplessly. Why was it that for most of his life, he had aimed to purge all emotion, but was now victim to the most confusing of them? Love. Affection. A desire to bond, to be close to Jim. To know his mind, soothe his fears, keep him safe. These were not things Vulcans spoke of often, let alone so freely.<br><br> \u201cDo not deny it,\u201d Selek said quietly. \u201cI have made that mistake, and now all I have is memories of a deep friendship and a regret for not acting upon my suppressed feelings until it was too late. I knew his mind, but not as intimately as I should have liked. My Jim and I, we never bonded. I deeply regret that.\u201d<br><br> Spock took in all that was his older counterpart just then: the deep lines in his face, the emotion in his eyes and voice, the defeated stance. His universe had supposedly been less unfortunate, a place where Vulcan had not been attacked and Jim\u2019s father had lived to provide him with a more peaceful life. Yet, Selek had not found peace there.<br><br> Any remaining anger at his counterpart for what he had done to Jim slipped away. \u201cYou are correct,\u201d he said instead and Selek sighed with relief.<br><br> \u201cThank you,\u201d he replied, although gratitude was so very illogical. \u201cI bid you good luck.\u201d<br><br> Spock nodded. \u201cI thank you, too,\u201d he said honestly, \u201cfor making me see reason.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br> Jim was sitting on a shady bench in Amanda\u2019s garden when Spock found him. Clearly, he had retreated here to think over his own conversation with Spock\u2019s counterpart, passing over the deck from the sitting room to reach it.<br><br> \u201cHas your conversation with Selek been satisfactory to you?\u201d Spock asked as he sat down next to Jim on the bench. Ever since touching his mind, he could not deny that he enjoyed seeking physical proximity to Jim whenever possible, although he had been careful not to draw attention to it.<br><br> \u201cYes, it was good to talk it over, actually,\u201d Jim said. He was smiling at Spock, but there was concern in his voice when he asked: \u201cHe talked to you, too?\u201d<br><br> \u201cHe did,\u201d Spock confirmed.<br><br> \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d<br><br> \u201cIt is \u2026 difficult to summarize adequately,\u201d Spock replied carefully, and was rewarded with another smile.<br><br> \u201cTry for me,\u201d Jim said gently. Spock had the fleeting thought that he could not remember the last time he had denied him any request.<br><br> \u201cHe asked me not to waste an opportunity.\u201d<br><br> Jim tilted his head. \u201cWhat kind of opportunity?\u201d<br><br> Spock held his breath as he, slowly, carefully, reached out for Jim\u2019s hand resting on the bench between them. He placed his own fingers directly on top of his. They were longer than Jim\u2019s, but the shape of their hands was the same. The sensation of their joined fingers was exquisite. \u201cThis,\u201d he said.<br><br> Jim stared down at their hands, then back up at Spock.<br><br> \u201cThis?\u201d he repeated, his brow furrowing. There was confusion in his eyes, certainly, but Spock could feel hope and warmth through their physical connection as well.<br><br> \u201cIndeed,\u201d Spock agreed, slipping his fingers between Jim\u2019s and lifting their entwined hands to settle them on his right thigh. After a few moments, Jim slumped against his side, a wave of content radiating through his skin as he settled against Spock\u2019s shoulder.<br><br> They stayed quiet after that. Due to the ever-present heat, Jim\u2019s hand soon became rather sticky, but Spock did not let go, holding on more tightly instead.<br><br> Silently, they watched swirls of sand blow gently around the cacti beds, both of them enjoying the closeness.<br><br> Finally, Spock could no longer reign in his questions: \u201cYou are \u2026 satisfied with this?\u201d<br><br> Jim, whose head had been resting on Spock\u2019s shoulder, straightened up. He turned slightly on the bench to look into Spock\u2019s face, though his hand stayed on Spock\u2019s thigh. \u201cIt depends on what you mean,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been the type to hold hands, but it\u2019s much more intimate with Vulcans, right?\u201d<br><br> Spock inclined his head. \u201cYes. But it is not what I meant, specifically. Rather, I was talking about the implications.\u201d<br><br> Jim smiled. \u201cAnd what are those implications?\u201d<br><br> Had Spock calculated wrong? Did Jim not understand what it meant when a Vulcan picked a partner? It was not done lightly, surely Jim had to know this by now.<br><br> \u201cI seek a relationship with you,\u201d Spock replied. \u201cA bond.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d Jim replied.<br><br> Spock did not think he entirely understood. \u201cThe bond I speak of is of a permanent nature,\u201d he elaborated.<br><br> Jim squeezed his fingers, which made Spock shiver in spite of the comfortable heat. \u201cSo you want something serious. That\u2019s fine with me, I can do that.\u201d<br><br> Quelling the frustration that threatened to build, Spock shook his head. \u201cI do not think you entirely understand. It is not like a relationship between Humans. It is not only serious, it is for life.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOh,\u201d Jim said. He blinked at Spock, then averted his eyes. Spock could feel his growing confusion and uncertainty through their connection. \u201cOh,\u201d he said again.<br><br> Spock\u2019s heart thumped faster than usual in his side. Even though he truly did not wish to disconnect, he gently released Jim\u2019s hand. It slipped off Spock\u2019s lap, hanging limply by Jim\u2019s side.<br><br> \u201cYou do not have to make this decision now. In fact, it is not a decision that is supposed to be made lightly or in haste.\u201d At least not for a Human. For Spock, who had felt Jim\u2019s mind, it had been an easy and irrevocable decision, even though it had needed Selek to see that the decision was already made.<br><br> \u201cSpock,\u201d Jim said. He sounded helpless. \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2026\u201d He trailed off and Spock tensed on the bench.<br><br> \u201cIf you are certain now that you do not wish a bond, I will of course respect that decision,\u201d he said. Although if Selek was correct about Jim and he being <em>t\u2019hy\u2019la</em>, it would make seeking another mate nearly impossible for Spock. He would accept that fact. He could not pressure Jim into an unwanted bond, did not wish to either.<br><br> \u201cNo,\u201d Jim replied firmly, though his was still not looking properly at Spock, only briefly glancing in his direction. \u201cGod, no, I\u2019m not saying-- Spock. It\u2019s just a lot to take in.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI see,\u201d Spock said carefully, but Jim shook his head.<br><br> \u201cNo, you really don\u2019t. You know, I\u2019ve only just come to terms that I maybe have more than just a slight crush on you, and now you\u2019re offering to get married or something. It\u2019s a lot to take in. I don\u2019t usually get proposed to after holding hands for a few minutes.\u201d<br><br> Spock did not know which part to focus on first in that pronouncement. Was it the reciprocal of affectionate feelings or the inadequate analogy of a Human marriage and a Vulcan bond?<br><br> \u201cYou have ample time to think about this,\u201d Spock finally said. \u201cI will await your decision. My interest will not change.\u201d<br><br> Jim cleared his throat, his eyes again fixed on one of Amanda\u2019s cacti. \u201cYou are really serious about this.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI have felt your mind,\u201d Spock explained. \u201cWe are highly compatible, Jim. A bond would be firm and most fulfilling between us.\u201d<br><br> Finally, Jim fully turned his head toward him. His eyes were narrowed. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, you want to be with me because my mind\u2019s a good match?\u201d<br><br> \u201cAn inaccurate but essentially correct statement.\u201d<br><br> Jim pursed his lips. \u201cSo you don\u2019t feel anything for me,\u201d he said. Spock opened his mouth to reply, but Jim did not let him talk. \u201cIt\u2019s a Vulcan mind thing. You just think I\u2019d be a logical choice of partner or something.\u201d He sounded upset.<br><br> Spock did not know for certain how to calm Jim. \u201cIt is the main aspect, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBonds are essential for Vulcans. But it does not mean a lack of feelings for the partner.\u201d<br><br> Jim did not seem satisfied. \u201cSo you do have feelings for me? You\u2019re attracted to me?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou are an attractive Human,\u201d Spock said, knowing it was not what Jim wanted to hear. But he could not talk openly about things like romantic affection. Love. It was not done. Between mates, it would be evident through the mental connection, the bond.<br><br> Jim nodded stiffly and stood. It was clear Spock had angered him. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll need time to think about this.\u201d<br><br> He ran a hand over his face, catching small pearls of sweat. His hair, much longer than when Spock had first seen him, curled messily around his Vulcan ear, shining brightly in the evening sun of Vulcan. The Vulcan sun had bleached it, just as it had tanned his skin and lightly freckled his face. Even though he was so unlike any Vulcan Spock had known in his life, Jim looked like he belonged on this hot, dry planet. By Spock\u2019s side.<br><br> Spock had to keep himself from standing too, from reaching out for Jim, to ask him for a meld. If he could show Jim what this meant to him, surely he would understand better.<br><br> \u201cI will await your decision,\u201d Spock said instead.<br><br> Jim left without another word.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><br>__ __ __</p>\n<p><br> Jim did not have dinner with the family. He had told Spock\u2019s mother that he was not feeling well and required rest. Although he despised dishonesty, Spock found himself hoping that it was one of those polite Human lies. He could not bare the thought that he had made Jim uncomfortable with his advances to a point where he felt physically sick.<br><br> \u201cDid you have an argument with Jim?\u201d Amanda asked when Spock helped her discard of the dishes after the meal.<br><br> \u201cI am uncertain,\u201d Spock admitted. Did their conversation qualify as an argument? It had certainly ended in discordance.<br><br> \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d Amanda offered.<br><br> Spock did not think he could tell his mother about his troubles, although she was a logical choice. As a Human bonded to a Vulcan, she would be most likely to understand Jim and give advice to Spock.<br><br> \u201cI do not,\u201d he told her nevertheless.<br><br> She accepted his decision, although she made a point of petting his cheek. The warmth and affection she projected helped calm Spock. For once, his mother\u2019s open emotional ways were a complete comfort to Spock.<br><br> \u201cYou will figure it out,\u201d she said. \u201cJim doesn\u2019t seem the kind to hold childish grudges. He\u2019s a good man.\u201d<br><br> \u201cA rather exceptional Human,\u201d Spock agreed and hastily turned away at the knowing look in Amanda\u2019s eyes.<br><br> He settled down in his room to meditate, but was soon interrupted by a knock on the door.<br><br> \u201cEnter,\u201d Spock said, seeing no point in denying entrance when he had already been disrupted in his meditation. He hastily got to his feet when he saw that it was Jim who entered his room.<br><br> Jim still looked tense, but he was sending Spock a small smile before he looked around.<br><br> \u201cYou may sit on my bed,\u201d Spock offered, as no other furniture in his room was adequate for sitting. He did not usually entertain visitors the few times he returned to his home planet.<br><br> Jim nodded and sank down at the very edge of Spock\u2019s cot. When he did not say anything, Spock laced his fingers behind his back to keep himself from reaching out to Jim once more. Jim had hardly taken a few hours to think. Spock could not believe he had come to give his consent and offer his mind to Spock.<br><br> \"Was there something you came to say?\" he eventually asked.<br><br> \"Yes, sorry,\" Jim replied. He took a deep breath, then let it out without saying anything. He sent another small smile towards Spock. Spock did not know how to decipher these clues, so he kept quiet.<br><br> \"Okay,\" Jim finally said. \"I'm sorry for how I reacted earlier.\"<br><br> \"You did not say or do anything that would require an apology,\" Spock replied honestly. Jim had not done anything to merit regret.<br><br> \"Sure I did. I was culturally insensitive and trying to press you into Human norms that don't apply to you and your society.\" He shook his head, still smiling. \"God, my xenology professors would be proud of me.\"<br><br> \"Your grades mark you as an exceptional student,\" Spock said, unsure how to take that statement. \"I am sure all of your teachers acknowledge that.\"<br><br> \"I like when you do that, you know?\" Jim said.<br><br> \"What exactly are you referring to?\"<br><br> \"Just \u2026 nevermind. Look, what I meant to say is: I'm sorry I got angry at you because you were being a perfectly normal Vulcan and I freaked out at you over it. If this is the way Vulcan bonds work, I shouldn't judge.\"<br><br> \"I see,\" Spock said carefully.<br><br> \"You really don't, but it's fine. So, let's just have this conversation again without me being an ignorant asshole, and maybe we can figure this relationship thing out.\"<br><br> Spock tried his best not to read too much into that statement. \"You wish to talk about the potential for a bond between us?\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" Jim said and patted the spot next to him on the bed.<br><br> Spock very carefully unlaced his hands, stepped up to the cot and sat down beside Jim.<br><br> \"So, you want to bond with me.\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" Spock said, feeling slightly light-headed for no logical reason.<br><br> \"And such a bond would be permanent, as in for life.\"<br><br> \"Yes.\"<br><br> \"And you're one hundred percent convinced that I'm the right choice for that?\"<br><br> \"As I said, our minds are highly compatible.\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" Jim said, but instead of narrowing his eyes, this time he kept smiling, nodding along. \"You explained that. But you know, for us Humans, that's kind of not how you decide to have a life-long relationship with somebody.\"<br><br> \"You do not find mental compatibility a legitimate reason for a romantic relationship,\" Spock translated.<br><br> Jim nodded. \"Exactly. I'm sure you know this already, but with Humans, it's a variety of factors. Physical attractiveness, for a start, but we already covered that you find me attractive.\"<br><br> \"You are indeed aesthetically pleasing,\" Spock acknowledged. Although he did not understand why, his responses did not seem to anger Jim this time, even though they were similiar to the ones he had given before.<br><br> \"But what else do you like about me?\" Jim asked.<br><br> \"What else?\" Spock repeated.<br><br> \"Yes. There must be character traits you find especially, um, pleasing? Don't tell me you only like me for my looks.\"<br><br> Ah. Spock had a sense that he knew what Jim was looking for.<br><br> \"You are intelligent and resourceful,\" Spock listed. \"I find that I find merit in both our chess matches and conversations. I believe both of these experiences would only be enhanced by a bond. I also am convinced of the goodness of your character. You have proven yourself selfless, brave and gracious.\"<br><br> Jim's smile widened so much that his teeth were showing and his cheeks turned slightly redder than usual.<br><br> \"Oh,\" he said. \"Thank you. I also like playing chess with you, and our talks. You're the smartest person I know, I think. And very kind. You\u2019ve been really patient with me all this time.\"<br><br> Spock inclined his head, unsure what else to say. Jim, however, seemed to have this conversation firmly in hand.<br><br> \"Good. So, we both like each other, we both find each other attractive. And our minds fit well, too, yes?\"<br><br> \"Yes,\" Spock repeated again, because apparently, Jim needed to be reassured again of that fact.<br><br> \"But you don't want to take things slow,\" Jim said.<br><br> \"I do not believe I understand.\"<br><br> \"Well, Humans don't usually decide to get married for life just like that. We're in a less serious relationship first to make sure if it's a match.\"<br><br> \"But I already know we are a match,\" Spock said. \"Our minds--\"<br><br> \"Are highly compatible. Yes.\" Jim let out a small laugh, but then turned more serious. \"Can you show me?\"<br><br> \"Show you?\"<br><br> \"That we're compatible.\"<br><br> \"You speak of another meld,\" Spock said. He found that he was overwhelmed at the rapid pace of this conversation. Jim seemed no longer angry, but instead interested.<br><br> As if to prove Spock right, Jim reached out for Spock's hand, just like Spock had done earlier in the garden. \"When we melded, it felt really good,\" he said. \"And I'm feeling so much better since. You've been taking care of me for weeks, but the meld -- I felt really safe, you know? It was a good experience. Really good.\"<br><br> \"I am gratified,\" Spock said.<br><br> \"So, will you show me?\"<br><br> \"I can initiate a meld,\" Spock acknowledged. \"However, I must warn you that it is not unlikely that a more permanent connection will be formed between us.\"<br><br> \"A bond?\"<br><br> Spock shook his head. \"No. It would not be a firm bond. For a bond to fully mature, other factors must come into play.\" He would not tell Jim about <em>pon farr</em> until it became absolutely necessary. \"But it would be the first step.\"<br><br> \"So, what would such a connection be like?\"<br><br> Spock considered how to best explain the concept to a generally psi-null species like Jim's. \"We would be close. We would sense each other's distress, but also content. We would be drawn to one another, essentially.\"<br><br> \"And you're sure this connection will happen if you meld with me?\"<br><br> \"Quite certain,\" Spock said. \"I do not believe I could control it were we to link our minds again.\"<br><br> Jim nodded. He was still holding Spock's hand, lightly squeezing Spock's fingers as he considered. Spock could feel nervousness mingled with affection, felt it mirrored in his own state of mind. He would definitely have to meditate deeply when this conversation was over.<br><br> \"Fine,\" he finally said. \"Let's do it.\"<br><br> \"You wish to meld?\" Spock asked. \"You are sure of this?\"<br><br> \"I'm sure,\" Jim said with emphasis. \"I trust you. You\u2019ve been taking care of me for weeks, you\u2019ve seen me at my worst, and you still think this is a good idea. And if you say we're a good match -- well. I wouldn't want to miss out on an opportunity like this.\"<br><br> Spock was reminded of Selek's words. <em>Do not waste your opportunity like I have.</em> He took in Kirk\u2019s determined face, the serious eyes. Nodding, Spock raised his hand.<br><br> \"My mind to your mind,\" he murmured as he slowly raised his hand and placed it gently against Jim\u2019s face, easily finding the psi points. \"My thoughts to your thoughts.\"<br><br> It was like they had never been parted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m damn well melting, is all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Leonard grouched for the fifth time, although his usual snarl did not keep him from thanking Amanda politely when she handed him a glass of chilled water. His parents had ingrained manners into him, after all.<br>\n<br>\nJim laughed silently at him as he accepted his own drink from Spock. \u201cYou actually get used to it,\u201d he assured him. \u201cEventually.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nLeonard scowled at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here for over three months. For all I know, you\u2019ve slowly been turned into a Vulcan.\u201d He threw a significant glance at Jim\u2019s ear.<br>\n<br>\nHe could not shake off the doctor\u2019s view, so he assessed the remaining scar tissue around the cartilage. Clearly, too much time had passed between the ear being cut off and the new one being attached for the skin to be fully regenerated.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Spock will assure you that I am as illogical and Human as ever,\u201d Jim said and smiled at the Commander in question.<br>\n<br>\nTo say he had been surprised when Jim had informed him of his relationship with the Vulcan had been an understatement. There had been a loud and angry conversation about Jim\u2019s mental state and inability to make serious decisions like this while he was still suffering from trauma -- a conversation really not suited to the restraints of shaky subspace vid calls.<br>\n<br>\nHe had come to terms with it, however, over the course of time. Jim had sounded disgustingly happy whenever he had talked about Spock afterwards, and the one time Spock had agreed to join Jim for another call, they had been so obviously affectionate with each other Leonard had ceased having a hard time wrapping his mind around the concept of a Vulcan in love.<br>\n<br>\nAnd now that he was here on Vulcan to pick Jim and Spock up and chaperone them on the flight back to San Francisco, he could see Jim was doing well. He had regained most of the weight and muscle lost during his time on Nero\u2019s ship, his mental imbalance seemed to have settled down during the past weeks and the sheer brightness of the smile reserved for Spock alone was blinding.<br>\n<br>\nLeonard could not recall Jocelyn ever looking at him this way. But then, they hadn\u2019t had a Vulcan voodoo bond to reassure each other of their mutual affection. They had had to figure it out the old-fashioned way -- and failed.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve been doing really well, Jim,\u201d Amanda said as she sat down next to Leonard. From what Leonard had gathered so far, she was not only an exceptionally smart but also caring woman who had adopted Jim as her own kin in no time. If somebody needed a steady, loving family, it was Jim Kirk. Leonard had been his sole confidant for far too long. \u201cSarek has been praising your Golic non-stop, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cThe ambassador is very kind,\u201d Jim said, waving off the compliment like it was nothing. Leonard knew Jim came across as arrogant and self-assured, and while that was certainly true on many occasions, it was but a reaction to a much deeper insecurity. Leonard doubted there were many people as brilliant and convinced of their own worthlessness as Jim.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cHe is also correct,\u201d Spock said. He sounded as calm and cold as ever, but Leonard was not fooled. He knew first hand from their joint rescue mission that Vulcans could be emotional, and even without that experience, it was clear in the way Spock\u2019s hand had curled around Jim\u2019s as soon as he had settled down next to him.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Amanda caught Leonard staring, she only threw him a knowing smile. Clearly, he was not the only one drawn in by the obvious affection between them.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving already,\u201d Amanda sighed.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cIt has been over three months since Jim\u2019s arrival, mother,\u201d Spock reminded her.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cStill,\u201d Amanda insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough. You\u2019ll have to visit as often as possible.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cOh, they\u2019ll be quite busy, from what I hear,\u201d Leonard said, taking an innocent sip of water as Jim stared at him.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d he asked eagerly.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cOh, you know,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cRumor mill\u2019s been working since they called you and Commander Spock back officially, is all I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou cannot keep me hanging like this, Bones. Seriously, spill!\u201d<br>\n<br>\nLeonard smirked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get your hopes up, kid.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nJim seemed stuck somewhere between laughing and wanting to beat Leonard to a pulp. Clearly, Spock was also picking up on it, as he said: \u201cPlease elaborate nonetheless, doctor. I have found that rumors do sometimes reflect the truth, if only partly.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nJim threw Spock a look that was so full of gratitude and warmth that Leonard had to avert his eyes after all. It seemed intrusive to see them like this. He focused on his drink when he said: \u201cWell, the <em>Enterprise</em> is one month off of being ready to launch again. They\u2019ve been sending out assignments, you see, and they seem to have come to the conclusion that the crew that handled Vulcan\u2019s distress call was a good match. They also seem to believe that her future captain should be from among that original crew.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Jim exclaimed. \u201cOh my god.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s all just a rumor. But Nurse Chapel has already received her letter, as have Chekov and Sulu, and they\u2019ve all retained their positions.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSpock,\u201d Jim said excitedly. \u201cSpock, are you hearing this?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI have not actually lost my hearing capabilities. Though it might be likely if you continue to speak in this volume,\u201d he replied, but the look he threw Jim was so clearly fond that it negated the chilling tone of his reprimand.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSorry, but the <em>Enterprise</em>, Spock. Can you believe it?\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAs I remember, we already had this very conversation one month and nineteen days ago. I can very well believe it.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nJim was clearly on edge for the rest of the day, breaking into random bouts of grinning for no reason that would have any Vulcan unused to Jim\u2019s demeanor bristle.<br>\n<br>\nLeonard accompanied Jim and Spock to Shi\u2019Khar hospital where Jim would get his last check-up before leaving Vulcan. After Jim received his stamp of approval, Leonard took his chance to talk to T\u2019Lkai, Jim\u2019s primary physician and clearly a very capable healer from what he had gathered from Jim\u2019s health reports.<br>\n<br>\nHe spent over an hour discussing with her the best way to treat and improve on Jim\u2019s hearing implant and finally received a request to keep her updated on \u201cthe honorable James Kirk\u2019s state of health\u201d. Clearly, Jim had managed to make more than one Vulcan care about him.<br>\n<br>\nWhen Leonard returned to the consulting room they had left to look over Jim\u2019s charts in detail, it was to Jim sitting on the examination table with his hand curled gently around Spock\u2019s face as he talked to him quietly. Spock\u2019s hands were tracing Jim\u2019s ears in return, one perfectly round, one sharply pointed.<br>\n<br>\nFor a few moments, Leonard indulged in the sight of seeing Jim fully at ease. It was not a sight that he had enjoyed often since they had become friends. Finally, Leonard cleared his throat and Spock hurriedly took a step away from Jim, lacing his hands behind his back like a good little Vulcan. He almost looked guilty in displaying affection for Jim in public, what with his eyes not quite meeting Leonard\u2019s gaze.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou ready to leave?\u201d Leonard asked.<br>\n<br>\nJim presented him a wide, happy smile. For a moment, all shadows of remaining trauma seemed to be gone and all that Leonard could see was a healthy, content Jim Kirk.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>"
