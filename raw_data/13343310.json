  "text": "<p>\u201cClass, make sure to get your permission slips signed by the end of the week! We\u2019ll be visiting Stark Tower on Monday and I doubt anyone wants to get left behind!\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Honestly, Peter wouldn\u2019t mind being left behind, he thought as he climbed onto the bus. A tour of the tower was a recipe for embarrassment and disaster on all counts. It was also ridiculous for him to walk to school just to be bused back home, but his chemistry teacher wasn\u2019t his biggest fan, so he didn\u2019t bother appealing. He sat in the front of the bus, far from Flash and his little friends. Unfortunately, as the bus started to move, Flash scurried back up the aisle and plopped down in the seat behind Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cParker!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ignored him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Parker!\u201d</p>\n<p>Joy to the world. Something thumped Peter\u2019s head, and he finally turned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been taking bets on whether or not people think you\u2019re lying!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLying about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe internship, idiot. I think you\u2019re faking it, but five people so far said they believe you. Did you pay them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I pay them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash rolled his eyes like he was talking to a deceased rock. \u201cFor attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want attention,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019d really rather you leave me alone, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot gonna happen, suck it! Hey, d\u2019you think we\u2019ll see Tony Stark himself? I bet you know him well, don\u2019t you? \u2018Cause you two are <em>best friends</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rubbed his forehead. \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, whatever, Parker. I bet when we get there, nobody\u2019s gonna know you.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Peter was mildly pleased to see Flash proven wrong within about a minute of being in the tower. They were standing in line to check in when someone called Peter\u2019s name. Peter (and the rest of the class) turned to see one of the secretaries waving to catch his attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, dear! Why are you waiting in line with the schools?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glanced over to Flash, who was gaping. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on a field trip!\u201d he called back. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you?\u201d The secretary looked faintly amused. \u201cWell, have fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Tina!\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone stepped forward, forming a line for the metal detector, which was really more of a scanner. It said each student\u2019s name flatly as they stepped through, and a guard checked them off on paper. When Peter took his turn, there was no robotic voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Parker. I must say, it\u2019s odd to find you using this entrance,\u201d JARVIS said pleasantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Peter replied. \u201cI\u2019m on a field trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I gathered. I hope you have a pleasant one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, JARVIS.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash jabbed Peter in the arm as soon as they started walking. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJARVIS. Ton- Mr. Stark\u2019s AI.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPay attention!\u201d their teacher rebuked. \u201cThe tour\u2019s about to begin!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter listened attentively as a young woman showed them down a hall lined with old prototypes and photos from the infancy of Stark Industries. He\u2019d only been down here once or twice, so he wasn\u2019t bored. Well, yet. They filed into an elevator and ascended to one of the research departments, where a short video was shown. The tour guide explained some new developments in such simple terms that a kid could understand, and Peter remembered that they <em>were</em> kids. He doubted anyone else in his class would understand a fraction of the mechanics and engineering that went in to the designs.</p>\n<p>Next, they were taken to one of the smaller labs. As they walked, Peter spotted Clint ambling down the hall, and the man\u2019s face lit up when their eyes met.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter! You didn\u2019t tell me your class was coming in!\u201d Clint strode over and fluffed Peter\u2019s hair fondly. Peter turned pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Clint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you taste the cookies that Barnes made last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head, and Clint started digging in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, they were delicious! They had little bits of walnuts and chocolate chips, but the kind of chocolate chips that make your brain melt a little\u2026 Here, found it! I saved you one, but I ate half because I figured you wouldn\u2019t mind. You <em>have</em> to convince him to make them again. Please, I beg you. Can I have half of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter broke the half-cookie into two pieces and handed one to Clint, who ate it happily. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Pete! See you later!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you,\u201d Peter replied, both amused and painfully embarrassed. Everyone was staring at him again. He ducked his head and ate his bite of cookie. It was really good. He\u2019d have to remember to compliment Bucky on them.</p>\n<p>After the visit to the small lab, the tour guide took them up to one of the major ones, where they all looked through a wide glass window at the proceedings inside. Peter caught a glimpse of Bruce, who was hunched over his laptop, seemingly puzzling over something. He looked up, and his face scrunched in surprise at the sight of Peter with the other kids at the window. His mouth curved into a smile, and he waved. Peter waved back and watched as Bruce pursed his lips, then stood up, making his way to the door and poking his head out.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Peter? Can I borrow you for a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looked to his teacher, who gaped. Bruce ran his fingers through his hair, looking apologetic.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be for long. I just need him to look something over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 sure, of course,\u201d the teacher stammered. Peter wove around his classmates and slipped through the door, following Bruce to his laptop.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you check to see if this formula makes sense? I\u2019m running on coffee and fumes at this point and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just seeing what I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded, tilting his head and biting his lip as he studied the complex formula. </p>\n<p>\u201cEverything seems to check out,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t take my word for it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll send it up to Tony. I just wanted to rule out any glaring errors. I appreciate your help,\u201d said Bruce, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do much,\u201d Peter replied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saving me from sending Tony anything obviously incorrect, which is about a week\u2019s worth of teasing,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s a solid favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Peter watched as Bruce yawned. \u201cYou should probably get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Bruce agreed. \u201cI meant to sleep last night, but I got absorbed. Have a good day, alright? I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Peter said, and headed for the door. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat was Dr. Banner!\u201d his teacher squeaked upon his return. Peter shuffled his feet. Luckily, the tour guide shepherded them away from the glass window, and Peter slid to the back of the group. They got into an elevator, and just as the doors were sliding shut, Pepper strode in. She was holding several notebooks, looking somewhat harried. She scanned the group superficially, and did a double-take when she spotted Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter! Why aren\u2019t you in school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on a field trip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that today? How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Peter said somewhat helplessly. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Pepper checked her watch and rubbed the bridge of her nose. \u201cEverything\u2019s running behind schedule today, what a mess. Dinner\u2019s probably going to be late tonight, alright? I think Clint wanted pizza, so we\u2019ll probably order out.\u201d</p>\n<p>The elevator stopped, and Pepper habitually pressed a quick kiss to Peter\u2019s forehead before stepping out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Flash whispered, squinting at Peter, who was rubbing at the smudge of lipstick that had probably been left behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody,\u201d Peter muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did she kiss you? What the hell is your deal, Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Flash. We\u2019re on a tour.\u201d It was the closest Peter had come to snapping in a while.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t-\u201d Flash cut himself off with a yelp; his ear had just been twisted by a bored-looking MJ. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said, and MJ just raised an eyebrow at him, unimpressed. The elevator doors opened again, and they all followed the tour guide out onto one of the manufacturing floors, where prototypes were generally made. Peter smiled at the sight of Oskar, one of his favorite engineers, digging through a drawer of screwdrivers. The man tended to misplace things; his brain worked in tangents that left huge messes wherever he worked. </p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Oskar!\u201d he called. Oskar popped up, his face stretching into a sparkling grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter! Can you help me find my T6 torx screwdriver? It\u2019s gone missing!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter trotted over, peering into the drawer.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably not in here, you must\u2019ve left it somewhere\u2026 When did you last have it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember!\u201d Oskar groaned. \u201cI used it last week on an upgrade to Colonel Rhodes\u2019s suit, but now that I have to make more modifications, I can\u2019t find it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you take it to the bathroom with you? Put it in your pocket? Leave it out on a workbench?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the last one,\u201d Oskar admitted. \u201cHey! Hey everyone! Please tell me if you see a T6 torx screwdriver!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one?\u201d a woman called, waving a screwdriver in the air, and Oskar\u2019s face brightened. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes! Thank you, Nadia! You\u2019re the best!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I was the best!\u201d a man cried from across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cTimes change, Neal!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRude!\u201d Neal replied. \u201cJust for that, you\u2019re not getting my leftovers at lunch!\u201d</p>\n<p>Oskar gasped dramatically, and Peter laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Oskar. It was good seeing you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to see you, my boy! Thank you for your help!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter waved, scurrying back to the group. No sooner as he returned, he saw Tony and Rhodey enter the room and make their way over to Oskar. Everyone in the group gasped or squeaked at the sight of them. Tony gave his paparazzi-smile and waved, his eyes widening when they caught on Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cKid, you didn\u2019t tell me your class was coming in! Shouldn\u2019t I have signed some sort of form? Permission slip? Is that a thing that they do still?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had Pepper sign it,\u201d Peter said. His cheeks were a deep red; everyone was gaping at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch betrayal,\u201d said Tony, shaking his head. Someone called for his attention, and he started. \u201cSee you later, Peter. Bye, Peter\u2019s class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s classmates looked like they were having heart palpitations. Flash opened his mouth and emitted a raspy wheeze of shock. Peter guessed that he was losing big money at this point. Idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the tour guide said, slightly thrown. She shook herself before continuing. \u201cAs you can see, this is where many Stark Industries prototypes are made. We have engineers from around the globe working on them, some of which are tested upstairs, which is where we\u2019re heading next. Now, if you could follow me back to the elevator\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>When lunchtime rolled around, a large group of Peter\u2019s classmates squished in around him, demanding to know why the hell everyone knew him so well. He dodged questions mostly by having his mouth full, but that strategy ran dry when he finished his sandwich.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, what the hell is your deal, Parker?\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter stared at the ceiling and mouthed \u2018help\u2019 to an unknown entity before leveling his gaze at Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m an intern here. I\u2019ve told you that already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re <em>actually</em> friends with Tony Stark. Why did he ask you about your permission slip, anyway? That was just weird. Shouldn\u2019t your little aunt just sign it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter did a full-body flinch at the mention of May and lifted his eyes back to the ceiling. Flash jabbed Peter\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked you a question!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter stammered for a second. \u201cWhen\u2026 when you work here, you -um- If you\u2019re coming in for other reasons, you have to sign something saying you won\u2019t spill any secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you know any secrets?\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone cleared their throat, and both Peter and Flash turned quickly. Peter let out an audible sigh of relief at the sight of Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Flash,\u201d Natasha said, sounding bored, but Peter could see something dark flickering in the back of her eyes. Evidently Flash saw it too, because he gulped and scooted away from Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know my name? Wait\u2026 are you the <em>Black Widow</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m one of Peter\u2019s friends. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d She stepped closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough to know that I don\u2019t particularly like you. You\u2019re bothering Peter. I don\u2019t like people who bother my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 no, no, I\u2019m not bothering him. We were just hanging out, right Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha\u2019s face turned cold. \u201cYou leave him alone if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Flash squeaked, putting on his last front of bravery. Natasha bared her teeth in a smile, and Flash nearly fell off the bench hurrying away. Natasha picked up his abandoned apple and took a bite. She wrinkled her nose and tossed it into a nearby trash can. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the tour, Peter?\u201d she said calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Peter replied, his voice somewhat weak. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha shrugged indifferently, but her eyes were warm. \u201cHair Club after school, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d Peter sighed. Natasha gave him a knowing look.</p>\n<p>\u201cJARVIS told us that the other kids were being annoying. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you have a little Winter Somebody tailing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hid his face in his hands. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how he gets,\u201d Natasha replied. \u201cNone of us want anyone bothering our precious Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter made a faint sound of embarrassment. \u201cYou guys are ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha pinched his cheek. \u201cYou love us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said I didn\u2019t,\u201d Peter mumbled grudgingly. Natasha gave a real smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you after school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Nat. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny time.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Peter noticed a limber figure following the group as they continued the tour after lunch. Bucky was <em>good</em>; Peter never caught more than a ghost of his presence, yet he was always there. It was comforting, though Peter didn\u2019t want to admit that. He smiled a little every time he caught a flash of metal or sweeping brown hair. It was because of Bucky that he wasn\u2019t nervous when he made his way to the bathroom and Flash followed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cParker! How much did you pay the Black Widow to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blinked. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I forgot. You can\u2019t afford her. How did you do it, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter ignored the question, keeping his eyes firmly to himself at the urinal. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to talk eventually, Parker. You\u2019re not telling anyone something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell anyone a lot of things,\u201d Peter replied mildly, re-zipping his jeans. When he turned, he saw Bucky standing directly behind Flash. Peter didn\u2019t startle; his ears had picked up on the faint squeak of the bathroom door several moments earlier. Flash clearly hadn\u2019t, because when he zipped his pants and pivoted for the door, he let out a noise that would\u2019ve been a scream if Bucky\u2019s hadn\u2019t clamped a hand over his mouth. His eyes were bugging out of his head, and if he hadn\u2019t just used the bathroom, Peter guessed he would\u2019ve pissed himself. To be fair, Peter might\u2019ve as well if he was in Flash\u2019s place. Bucky looked angry, and an angry Bucky was flat-out terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cRomanova warned you,\u201d Bucky said. \u201cTold you not to bother Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash choked on his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash frantically tried to speak, and Bucky removed his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! I won\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll stay away from Peter, I swear. I\u2019ll never talk to him again. Just let me go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Flash twisted to look at Peter. \u201cWhat the hell, Parker? Why the hell are you hiring people to scare me? You\u2019re such a fucking baby!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky gripped Flash\u2019s shoulder hard enough that he whimpered.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter did not hire me. Peter is a mission-assist and primary sub-target. He is a good person. He deserves more than anyone can offer him. You are a potential threat to his happiness. I will not tolerate that. Do you understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! I understand, let me go!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky didn\u2019t let go. \u201cThis is your second warning today. I hope you don\u2019t need a third.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t bother Peter, I swear!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make promises that you don\u2019t intend to keep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash said something unintelligible. </p>\n<p>\u201cMind yourself. You don\u2019t want to meet Hill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe met Hill,\u201d Peter said. \u201cShe picked me up from school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to meet Hill again, then,\u201d Bucky amended. \u201cWouldn\u2019t go well for you, Eugene.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash turned red, but his fear seemed to outweigh his anger. Bucky released him, and he scurried out of the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t quit, does he,\u201d Bucky grunted.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Peter. \u201cHe\u2019s not really that bad, most of the time. You guys really don\u2019t have to try to stop him. It might just make it worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think we made an impression.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back at it again by next week, though. Once he realizes that you\u2019re not actually going to do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho said we wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just some insecure kid. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky frowned, but nodded. \u201cReevaluating tactics.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTactics?\u201d Peter asked, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mission sub-target. Mission: protect. Original strategy: intimidation. Reevaluating tactics for effective protection detail.\u201d Bucky shrugged. \u201cSometimes the first strategy isn\u2019t the best one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Bucky spoke again, his voice was low and soft. \u201cI want to keep you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter felt something foreignly warm flow through him. He blinked. He felt more wanted than he had in a long time. Bucky placed a hand on his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on. You\u2019ve been in here too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Peter said around a lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cRomanova said we\u2019re having Hair Club after school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Clint gave me one of the cookies you made, it was really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky inclined his head, his mouth curling up a little, and gestured to the door. Peter gave him a small smile in return before leaving.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Flash stayed away from Peter for the rest of the field trip, which Peter found quite pleasant. It was odd, being with his classmates and not having Flash breathing up his neck. He started to let his guard down, and by the time they had to leave, Peter found that he\u2019d genuinely had a decent few hours. He talked to MJ a bit, which kept him on his toes in a different way. She was sharp; he made a mental note never to introduce her to Natasha, Hill, or Pepper. The three of them were terrifying enough without another in their ranks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay thank you to Sarah for showing us around, class!\u201d their teacher called as the tour guide left them in the lobby.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d everyone chorused, and the woman smiled. </p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you enjoyed your tour of the tower!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was wonderful, really,\u201d their teacher gushed. \u201cSuch a fantastic opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter tapped the teacher on the shoulder as they headed for the front doors.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I just stay here? I -uh- I come here after school anyways for my internship, so it\u2019d probably be more convenient\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave you here without a parent. You\u2019ll have to come back to school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Peter said. </p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Hayes!\u201d a girl cried. \u201cI think I left my phone in the bathroom!\u201d</p>\n<p>The teacher sighed. \u201cDo you remember which bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, the one by the testing room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, Rebecca. You can\u2019t go by yourself, and I can\u2019t leave everyone else here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter can go get it, can\u2019t he? He works here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s under my supervision,\u201d said Mr. Hayes. \u201cHe\u2019s staying right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can have someone bring it down,\u201d Peter offered. Mr. Hayes gave him a suspicious look, but nodded in agreement. Peter pulled out his own phone and plugged in his headphones.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, JARVIS?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can I help you, Mr. Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis girl left her phone in the bathroom on the seventh floor. Can you have someone bring it down, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly. Would you also like me to send Mrs. Potts or Mr. Stark down to collect you from your teacher? It would be counterproductive to be bussed back to your school and proceed to walk back to where you came.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I think they\u2019re probably too busy,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stark is currently debating the best kind of mac n cheese with Colonel Rhodes. I would hesitate to classify him as busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 okay,\u201d Peter mumbled. The girl poked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs someone bringing my phone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019ll be down in a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank god. I was totally freaking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter kept his eyes on the elevators. Not three minutes later, a man stepped out of the leftmost, a phone in hand. He scanned the lobby before making his way over to the group. The girl -Rebecca- took it from him, thanking him effusively. He shrugged, heading back to the elevators. The doors to the middle one opened, and he stepped in as Tony strode out. Mr. Hayes\u2019s eyes widened as Tony marched over.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be keeping Peter,\u201d Tony stated, placing a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your visit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 Alright,\u201d Mr. Hayes said weakly. \u201cYes, it was really-\u201d</p>\n<p>Before the man could finish, Tony was cutting him a paparazzi smile and steering Peter to the elevators.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that guy,\u201d Tony said. \u201cHe was a dick during that conference Steve and I went to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter put on his best surprised-face. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he insinuated some rude shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Tony. \u201cGot plans for the evening?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cHair Club.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised that they roped you into Hair Club? Well, if you get bored, come hang around with me n\u2019 Rhodey. We\u2019ll be in the workshop. We\u2019re so much cooler.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter laughed. \u201cThanks, Tony. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by.\u201d</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Hair Club was the best. They met in Bucky and Steve\u2019s living room this time; Steve had been exiled to the shared floor. Peter\u2019s head was resting in Pepper\u2019s lap, and she was carding her fingers through his hair with one hand while clicking through emails with the other. She had insisted on coming despite being overloaded with work, so she was multitasking. Natasha was sitting behind them, curling Pepper\u2019s hair. Bucky was practicing Dutch braids on Hill, who hadn\u2019t winced once despite Bucky accidentally pulling a little too hard with his metal hand now and then.</p>\n<p>\u201cNew mission protocol,\u201d Bucky announced after a period of silence. \u201cStrategy: display care. Maintain a strong presence around threats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? That sounds like a good plan, Barnes,\u201d said Natasha. Bucky nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I want to know what you mean?\u201d Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just means that we make sure that Flash knows we\u2019re your friends,\u201d Natasha told him. He furrowed his brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur presence will remind him of the warnings he received. He will be more likely to think of consequences before engaging,\u201d said Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a neutral approach,\u201d Pepper said, managing to type surprisingly fast with just one hand. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do too,\u201d Hill agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make a schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood idea. We should include alternates in case of unforeseen exigencies,\u201d said Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cExigencies,\u201d Hill echoed. \u201cStrong word.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s mouth curved up. </p>\n<p>\u201cShould the schedule be regular?\u201d Pepper asked. \u201cBecause our personal agendas vary every week, so that might be difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start by availability,\u201d Natasha replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d asked Peter, completely lost. \u201cSchedules?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho walks you there and picks you up,\u201d Pepper said somewhat absently, scanning a new email.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom <em>school</em>?\u201d Peter looked horrified. \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point,\u201d Bucky said, and proceeded to offer no explanation. Peter groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re pretty cool,\u201d said Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019d be cramping your style.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no, but\u2026 everyone\u2019s going to ask questions!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay that we\u2019re friends from work,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cAnd that we like to laugh at teenagers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter tried to be put off, but Pepper started massaging the back of his neck and he melted.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. But only because I know I can\u2019t stop you guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are apex predators,\u201d Hill said, grinning. \u201cBeware, youngling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSquirt,\u201d Natasha provided.</p>\n<p>\u201cUrchin,\u201d said Pepper.</p>\n<p>\u201cTeenybopper,\u201d supplied Bucky. \u201cWee childer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone burst into laughter. Pepper threw her head back, Natasha cackled loudly, and Hill wheezed. Peter\u2019s face was red. Bucky maintained a completely serious expression for longer than was humanly possible before giving them a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you come up with those?\u201d Hill gasped. \u201cOh my god. Wee childer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper managed to compose herself, returning to her emails, though her eyes were mirthful.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky Tony isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease nobody tell him!\u201d Peter said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to call me a teenybopper!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly good word,\u201d Bucky replied, and Peter glared at him halfheartedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky reached over and patted Peter\u2019s knee.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe. For now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter was only mildly surprised to find Hill waiting for him in the kitchen the next morning, a warm bowl of oatmeal on the table. He\u2019d had a sinking suspicion that they were being serious about accompanying him to and from school; he was proved correct. He sat down, shoveling oatmeal into his mouth with a muffled \u201cfanks!\u201d before nearly spitting it back out, having forgotten to check if it was cool enough to eat. His tongue felt like it\u2019d been boiled, and his eyes watered copiously. Hill patted his head, trying to hide her amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw,\u201d Peter mumbled, sucking air in through his mouth in attempt to cool his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Hill said pleasantly, and Peter groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thuffering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThorry,\u201d Hill replied, her eyes twinkling. Peter pouted at her, stirring his oatmeal slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d he asked after scooping another spoonful and blowing on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already ate mine,\u201d said Hill. Peter stared.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill shrugged. \u201cMagic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter raised an eyebrow, and she laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI put mine in the freezer to cool it down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel so betrayed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill patted his shoulder. \u201cEat. We leave in ten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter blew on his spoonful of oatmeal again, looked at it suspiciously, then ate it, relieved to find it agreeably warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWork around the edges,\u201d Hill told him. \u201cThey cool the fastest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. Smart,\u201d Peter said. He scraped spoonfuls from the perimeter of his bowl, gulping them down quickly and succeeding in not burning his tongue again. He finished exactly ten minutes later, and placed his bowl in the sink before trotting after Hill to the elevator. </p>\n<p>The air was brisk as they stepped out of the lobby; Pete shoved his hands in his pockets. Hill was wearing a light jacket, presumably having checked the weather before leaving. Peter should be more like her, he thought. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your first class?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s Tuesday\u2026 Math.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill nodded. \u201cWhat are you guys working on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust logarithms and stuff. It\u2019s really easy as long as you know the properties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Peter said, shrugging. \u201cSort of boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s too easy?\u201d asked Hill.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replied, slightly hesitant. \u201cI mean\u2026 I think I could\u2019ve taken Calculus this year, but I\u2019d have to test out of Precalc and I was sort of too lazy to do that. Or, well, I just didn\u2019t really want to. I would\u2019ve had to talk to the head of the department, and she\u2019s scary. I don\u2019t think she likes me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill narrowed her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, now you have that avenging look on your face, which I guess is appropriate given your occupation, but please don\u2019t talk to the department head! It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take Calculus next year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill continued to look offended on Peter\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Peter, almost begging, and Hill relented.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine\u201d she said. \u201cBut if she gives you trouble\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Tell you. I promise, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill looked only slightly appeased, but soon resettled her expression into a warmer one. \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite teacher?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy history teacher is really nice,\u201d Peter said after considering. \u201cHistory isn\u2019t my favorite, but he\u2019s cool guy. My English teacher is pretty considerate, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. It\u2019s really too bad that your chemistry teacher isn\u2019t great. I know you love science.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cNext year, when I take physics, I should get a better one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Hill. She stopped them, looked both ways, then tugged Peter across the street to the concrete steps in front of his school. \u201cHere you are. Walking with me wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter said grudgingly. Hill pulled him in for a quick hug, and he flailed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI take that back! This is terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hill ruffled his hair fondly. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter grumbled, fixing his hair and straightening his shirt. He noticed a few kids watching them and resisted the urge to hide behind his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for walking with me. It was nice,\u201d he admitted, looking at his feet. Hill grinned. </p>\n<p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll see Steve later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve!\u201d Peter squeaked. \u201cOh my god! I thought this was just a Hair Club thing! Everyone\u2019s gonna stare at me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll live,\u201d Hill said, and left before he could protest further. He resigned himself to climbing the steps and entering the school, dodging a bouncy ball that some kids were hurling around as he made his way to math. He managed to avoid Flash by ducking into an empty classroom for a minute; he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be so lucky later.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t so lucky. He was just passing the gym after the last bell rang when Flash and his gang caught up to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Penis!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pressed his lips together, pushing through the throngs of kids and heading for the front door. Flash followed. The crowds thinned as they got outside, yet Peter found himself sandwiched between Flash and some kid that was maybe called Joe. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was with the lady walking you to school today? Did you pay her, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Peter gritted out. Flash laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way. Did you give her ten? Twenty?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d someone called, and Peter wanted to disappear at the sight of Captain Goddamn America waving his hands frantically to catch Peter\u2019s attention. Flash froze, and Peter wiggled out from between him and Joe. Peter hurried over, giving Steve the universal throat-slashing gesture of \u2018cut it out,\u2019 but the damage was done. Everyone, literally <em>everyone</em> was staring. Steve seemed to be either oblivious or ignoring it, because he grinned widely and tossed an arm over Peter\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was school, buddy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Peter whispered, mortified. He let Steve steer him out of the crowd and across the street, where few people attempted to follow them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Steve asked, concerned after glancing down at Peter, who ceded to the urge to hide and buried his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he whimpered. \u201cNobody will leave me alone again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve frowned, his brain clicking, and then pulled a face like a distraught puppy. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about that, I\u2019m sorry, Peter. I can go tell them-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter said hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it. I\u2019ll just ignore them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI forgot about the unwanted attention. Gosh, I\u2019m dense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d said Peter, and Steve raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cMaybe just a little bit? In certain situations?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve laughed. \u201cSubtlety\u2019s never been my strong suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter agreed. As they slipped into light conversation, Peter found that Steve\u2019s arm was still draped over his shoulders. It was nice, he decided. It made him feel like he belonged somewhere. Like he had friends. </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>The next morning, Peter was slightly more surprised to find Bruce sitting in the kitchen, drinking coffee and reading a paper beside a wide variety of cereals. He looked up when Peter entered and smiled wryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of cook compared to some of the others. I hope you don\u2019t mind cereal,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cereal\u2019s great, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter replied quickly. \u201cI usually just eat Froot Loops for breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looked faintly relieved. He yawned and took another gulp of coffee. \u201cYou really get up this early every day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d Peter answered, pouring some cereal into a bowl. </p>\n<p>Bruce nodded. He looked like he hadn\u2019t slept much at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to get up just to walk me to school. I\u2019m fine on my own,\u201d said Peter, feeling slightly guilty. </p>\n<p>\u201cNatasha said it would be good for me, going outside, getting some exercise. I figured I\u2019d listen to her. I wouldn\u2019t have slept much longer anyway,\u201d Bruce told him. \u201cCoffee\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIs there any extra?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce nodded to the half-full coffee pot on the counter. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiled in thanks, getting up and pulling a mug from the cabinet above the sink, filling it three-quarters full with coffee. He opened the fridge and grabbed the milk, pouring some in his coffee and some in his cereal. He plopped down again in the seat next to<br>\nBruce, taking a swig of coffee and a large mouthful of cereal.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest you eat quickly, Mr. Parker. You are due to leave for school in five minutes,\u201d said JARVIS, and Peter picked up the pace. </p>\n<p>Bruce looked vaguely perturbed, as if he was worried that Peter might choke. </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe slow down a little bit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTh\u2019fine,\u201d Peter replied around his Froot Loops. \u201cThith ith normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce nodded slowly and went back to reading, sipping at his coffee. Peter finished his cereal in record time and dumped his bowl in<br>\nthe sink, shoving his feet in his shoes and scooping up his backpack. Bruce tailed him into the elevator, his expression thoughtful.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Peter asked, tilting his head as they descended.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just can\u2019t remember the last time I went outside. Not counting emergencies, I mean. Natasha was right, I really don\u2019t get out much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shrugged. \u201cToo busy. And no real reason to leave the lab, I suppose. It\u2019s nice, doing something different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like being outside?\u201d asked Peter, curious, as they stepped out of the elevator and made their way out of the lobby. Bruce took in a deep breath of morning city air, looking pensive.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think so. Do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I like exploring. Patrol is fun \u2018cause it\u2019s exhilarating, but sometimes I just like to walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d Bruce said, looking around and taking in the cars whizzing by and the waxing and waning crowds on the sidewalks. </p>\n<p>He let out a short laugh. \u201cI forget that all this exists, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cI can see that happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were silent for a couple minutes, and then Bruce spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like school?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter made a face. \u201cI guess\u2026 sort of. I like to learn, but the people suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a similar mindset at your age. Well, I still do,\u201d Bruce amended. \u201cBut people suck less as you get older, generally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds nice,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI love science, but my chemistry teacher doesn\u2019t like me. He\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he like you?\u201d Bruce asked, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t pay attention sometimes. The class is really easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it? What are you working on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight now? Stoichiometry and percent yield. It\u2019s just plugging in numbers. Boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like it. You should stop by the lab more often. We\u2019re doing a biochemistry project that you might find interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter brightened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019re working on synthesizing cells. Pretty neat,\u201d Bruce said, rubbing the back of his neck modestly. </p>\n<p>\u201cCool! Maybe I\u2019ll come by later.\u201d</p>\n<p>They crossed the street, approaching Peter\u2019s school. They\u2019d walked quickly; kids were still hanging out in groups outside the doors, the bell not having rung yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Penis! Who\u2019s your friend?\u201d Flash shouted, and Peter sighed. Bruce looked at him, his brow furrowing deeply, then dropping low.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid that kid just call you <em>Penis</em>?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s fine. You should probably go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeeeenis! I asked you a question!\u201d </p>\n<p>Peter firmly ignored him in lieu of trying to wave Bruce away.</p>\n<p>\u201cParker! How many dicks did you suck to get the fancy bodyguards?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s eyes flashed a dangerous green, and Peter quickly dragged him across the road.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Bruce. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter repeated, keeping his voice low and steady, because Bruce looked furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fine,\u201d Bruce said shortly, his fists balling and slackening. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t bother me, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce clearly didn\u2019t believe him; his eyes had lost their radioactive color and were now simply dark with anger, though his control<br>\nseemed intact, thank god.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey really just say things like that? Is this normal?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I swear. It doesn\u2019t really bother me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit. The kid just fu- just flipping asked if you\u2026\u201d Bruce shook his head sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a little, but it\u2019s really not a big deal,\u201d Peter said, attempting earnest.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me a good reason why I shouldn\u2019t walk across the road straight into the principal\u2019s office and report the kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s face fell. \u201cBruce, you can\u2019t. Please. It would just make it worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce closed his eyes, then sighed, crumbling slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Just\u2026 What\u2019s the kid\u2019s name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlash,\u201d Peter said, and Bruce gave him a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis full name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEugene Thompson,\u201d Peter relented. He picked up on the faint sound of the bell, and glanced across the street to see the crowds thinning as everyone headed into the school. Bruce followed his gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your cue, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cThanks for walking with me. It was fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s cheeks pinkened slightly, like he wasn\u2019t used to people enjoying his presence. That should be fixed, Peter thought briefly to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a good day. I think Pepper\u2019s picking you up,\u201d said Bruce.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Peter said, smiling, and darted across the street. When he glanced back as he pulled the door open, Bruce was still standing there, watching.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Flash caught up to him after school, as usual. Peter didn\u2019t bother trying to escape this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho was the bodyguard this morning, Parker? He didn\u2019t look as tough as the others. Big downgrade from Captain America, huh? Did you run out of money, or did your jaw get sore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPiss off, Flash,\u201d Peter sighed, gripping the straps of his backpack.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that, Penis. I was just asking, no need to get unfriendly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter didn\u2019t reply, exhaling as he pushed his way through the door into the sunlight. Flash dogged him, giving him a jab in the ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Captain America today? How are you gonna get attention now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash laughed. \u201cYeah, right. Why else would you hire him to pick you up from school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hire him,\u201d Peter said, his voice strained. He let out a breath of relief when he caught sight of Pepper waiting on the sidewalk. He strode forward to meet her, fast enough to leave Flash a few steps behind him. She smiled fondly at the sight of him and pressed a kiss to his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugged, internally glowing with warmth like he always did when Pepper treated him like her son.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was alright,\u201d he replied. He could feel Flash\u2019s eyes on the back of his neck. Pepper nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking we could stop and get some cheese on the way home? There\u2019s a new farmers\u2019 market that I want to check out, and we can never get enough cheese, or so says Barnes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Peter replied, following Pepper away from the throngs of teenagers down the sidewalk. No snarky comments followed him; he guessed that Flash still didn\u2019t know what to make of Pepper.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter,\u201d said Pepper once they were a block away, and Peter\u2019s heart sank. She sounded serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he replied nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce told me something that I didn\u2019t like to hear this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Peter squeaked, trying to feign surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t play dumb with me. It\u2019s not okay for your peers to suggest that you\u2019re performing sexual favors in exchange for us to be around you. It is <em>not</em> okay. Ah, don\u2019t argue. I\u2019m not done. It\u2019s highly inappropriate, and it can\u2019t be good for you, no matter how much you insist it\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t tolerate behavior like that, even if you will. I can\u2019t hear about this and not do something about it, so you have a choice. Either we go in early and talk to the principal tomorrow morning, or I let Tony or Steve do something about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shook his head, looking unusually pale. \u201cI really don\u2019t like either of those options.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could homeschool you, then. Transfer you, maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rubbed his forehead, where a sharp ache was developing. \u201cPepper\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter. I can\u2019t stand by while you\u2019re harassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter let out an unsteady breath, and Pepper stopped walking and pulled him into a tight hug. He dropped his head onto her shoulder, breathing in the faint scent of perfume and laundry detergent. He could feel people pushing past them, making sounds of annoyance for stopping in the middle of the sidewalk, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care. Pepper was probably giving them all glares of death, anyway. After a long minute, Pepper stepped back, her hands on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d she told him, and he wanted more than anything to believe her.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t expect Bucky and Bruce to be waiting for him when he stepped off the elevator towards his room, but there they were; their expressions were an almost comical contrast. Bucky looked livid, and Bruce apologetic. When Bucky strode forward, Peter was almost afraid, except he was being tightly wrapped in Bucky\u2019s arms and pulled against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow fucking <em>dare</em> he insinuate\u2026 I\u2019m gonna fucking-\u201d Bucky cut himself off, clearly still seething. Peter tilted his head to glance at Bruce, who lifted his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe bugged your backpack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter wiggled a bit, looking up at Bucky.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bugged my backpack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky was still wearing a fierce expression. \u201cMission is protect. You know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so\u2026 Did you <em>just</em> bug my backpack, or\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour jacket, too,\u201d Bucky said, not looking guilty in the least.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich jacket?\u201d Peter asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d Bucky replied, as if it was obvious, and released Peter reluctantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about-\u201d Bruce waved his hand, \u201call this. In my defense, I said I wouldn\u2019t tell your principal, but I didn\u2019t promise anything about not telling anyone else, and I thought that Pepper should know as one of your legal guardians\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cShe would\u2019ve found out anyway, since <em>someone</em> bugged my backpack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your jackets,\u201d Bucky said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my jackets.\u201d </p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Pepper and Peter set off early the next morning, making it to school fifteen minutes before the bell. Pepper\u2019s hand rested firmly on Peter\u2019s shoulder as they stepped into the waiting room outside the principal\u2019s office. The secretary looked up at them.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to address some concerns. Is the principal available?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d said the secretary, getting up and pushing the office door open. She said something and withdrew, waving Peter and Pepper towards the door. They stepped inside and took a seat across from the principal\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d the principal asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter is being harassed by another student, and I\u2019d like to put an end to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long has this been going on? I\u2019ve never gotten any reports of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper turned to Peter and nudged his arm. He shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cYears. Since middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you reported anything, Mr. Parker?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I was hoping they\u2019d stop if I didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see. I assume that hasn\u2019t worked out for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid anything happen to cause that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSort of. I mean\u2026 Ever since the field trip to Stark Tower, they\u2019ve been bothering me more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2026 I live there, and people know me, and I think people were just curious at first, but then they started\u2026 implying things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d the principal prompted. Peter bit his lip and looked to Pepper, his eyes pleading.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople have suggested that Peter performs sexual favors for and pays the residents of the tower to be around him. I find that absolutely unacceptable,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cYou understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly, I\u2026\u201d the principal trailed off, slightly shocked. \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable at all. Which student said that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEugene Thompson,\u201d Pepper replied, and the principal winced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was afraid of that. I\u2019m completely on your side, but the Thompsons have a considerable amount of money and good lawyers. It\u2019ll be hard to do anything without evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have evidence.\u201d Pepper held up a flashdrive*, which the principal took, frowning slightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre they videos? It\u2019s against school policy to film other students without their consent\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper shook her head. \u201cOur family takes security very seriously. Peter\u2019s backpack has listening equipment installed in it to ensure his safety. Since New York has a one-party consent wiretapping law, the audio recordings were obtained legally, though Mr. Thompson\u2019s lawyers are welcome to debate with ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d the principal said weakly. \u201cWell, hopefully it doesn\u2019t come to legal action. Why don\u2019t I call Mr. Thompson into the office?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d said Pepper. The principal got up and slipped out of the office, and a few moments later, the loudspeaker crackled.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould Eugene Thompson please make his way to the main office? Eugene Thompson to the main office.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was less than three minutes before something twitched in the back of Peter\u2019s head and Flash followed the principal into the office.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease sit, Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash sat, looking like he was tasting something rotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been informed that you\u2019ve been saying that Mr. Parker performs sexual favors in exchange for certain people to spend time with him. That\u2019s completely unacceptable behavior, and I won\u2019t tolerate it in this school. This is your only warning. Please stop making such implications, or you will face the consequences of your actions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash curled his lip. \u201cParker\u2019s lying. You don\u2019t have any proof.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find yourself wrong, Eugene.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time, Flash looked slightly nervous. He watched the principal plug the flashdrive into his computer, then click on the first file.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cParker! How much did you pay the Black Widow to do that?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI didn\u2019t pay her.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYeah, I forgot. You can\u2019t afford her. How did you do it, then?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The principal clicked the second one.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201dWhat was with the lady walking you to school today? Did you pay her, too?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The third.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201dYou must really want attention, Parker. Either that, or you\u2019re really gay.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The fourth. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cParker! How many dicks did you suck to get the fancy bodyguards?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The fifth.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201dWhose dick do you even suck, anyway? Their managers? Or do you suck dick for money and use the money to pay them?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The sixth.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201dWho was the bodyguard this morning, Parker? He didn\u2019t look as tough as the others. Big downgrade from Captain America, huh? Did you run out of money, or did your jaw get sore?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Either that was the last one, or the principal had had enough, because he looked up at Flash and lifted an eyebrow. Flash shrank a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to take legal action,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cI\u2019m sure your lawyers are nice, but so are ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>For once, Flash didn\u2019t seem to have a response.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou understand, then? This stops now,\u201d the principal said. Flash nodded like it pained him. He didn\u2019t look at Peter. \u201cOff you go, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash jumped to his feet and scurried away, pulling out his phone as he went, presumably to call his dad.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d the principal asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, actually. I was wondering if it would be possible to switch Peter into a different chemistry class? He shares it with Mr. Thompson, and I think it\u2019d really be best if they stayed separate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can definitely do that. Are there any other classes you have together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGym,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an easy fix,\u201d the principal told him. \u201cYou\u2019d just have a different study hall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d said Peter. \u201cThat would sort of be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>The principal clicked away at his computer, muttering to himself. The keyboard clattered as he typed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 you should be all set,\u201d he finally said, looking up again. \u201cI\u2019ll have Donna print you a schedule, does that sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Please don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if there\u2019s anything else I can do, or if there\u2019s any further incidents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you very much, sir,\u201d Pepper said, shooting the principal a winning smile. \u201cI really appreciate your time and care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d said the principal, slightly pink-cheeked. \u201cHave a nice day, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper stood up and marched out, Peter on her tail. Once in the hall, she turned and pressed a kiss to his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a good day, alright? I believe Barnes and Nat are planning on collecting you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of them?\u201d Peter said weakly. Pepper laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe other kids won\u2019t know what hit them. I\u2019ll see you after school, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you after school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper smiled, squeezed his shoulder, then strode off towards the front doors, her heels clacking in the tile floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Parker!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turned to find the secretary waving a paper at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s your new schedule.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Peter, taking the sheet of paper. The secretary glanced around before speaking again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s quite something,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a year to see that Thompson kid\u2019s ass handed to him. He\u2019s a pain in mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes widened, and he let out an involuntary sound that was almost a giggle. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d the secretary muttered before straightening up and arranging her face to look the usual bored and slightly annoyed. \u201cGet to class, Parker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter was fairly sure that he was dreaming as he made his way down the hall towards his English class. Had that really just happened? </p>\n<p>Maybe he was hallucinating. Maybe Loki had vanished him into an alternate universe. He pinched himself and winced slightly. He was definitely awake, though that didn\u2019t answer the latter questions. The bell rang, and he jumped, picking up the pace. He didn\u2019t want to get a tardy. </p>\n<p>When he skidded into his English classroom, the teacher was nowhere to be seen. He sat down, looking around slowly in case he\u2019d missed something. A minute later, a substitute teacher walked into the classroom, and the kids let out a collective cheer. Peter couldn\u2019t believe it. For once, life seemed to be going his way.</p>\n<p>(*FLASHdrive hahahaha get it?)</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Peter headed for the front doors, bracing himself for Flash to tail him. To his shock, he made it outside without a single \u201cPenis!\u201d. He turned around and found Flash positively glowering, but keeping his distance. Suddenly, Flash went pale, and Peter felt a metal arm being tossed over his shoulders. He smiled up at Bucky and Natasha.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Natasha said, her eyes firmly on Flash. Bucky twisted his face into a shark-like grin at the boy, and Natasha waved. Flash spun around and ran; Bucky made a content sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was your day,\u201d he said, looking down at Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was fine. Actually, pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cBarnes made you cookies, but I have a strong suspicion that Clint\u2019s eaten most of them by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky narrowed his eyes. \u201cHe better not have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think your expectations of him are too high,\u201d Natasha said. Bucky grumbled, looking displeased.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is off the mission-assist list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s harsh,\u201d said Natasha, her lips twitching. Bucky shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cConsequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snickered. Today was turning out to be a good day indeed.</p>"
