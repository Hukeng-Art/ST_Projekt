  "text": "<p>Harry and Hermione met up discreetly at a caf\u00e9 in London, with the rumbles of a cappuccino machine and the murmurs of the busy crowd of people at tables all around them providing its own kind of noisy privacy. Harry hated going out in Diagon Alley still \u2013 nothing he did there went unremarked. But here in the Muggle world he was a nonentity, just the way he liked it. No-one praised him, no-one blamed him, and no-one tried to listen in on his conversations in hopes of gleaning some gossip to share with <em>The Daily Prophet </em>or <em>Witch Weekly</em>.</p>\n<p>Hermione sipped at her coffee with a shot of cinnamon, and eyed Harry worriedly. He looked nervous, just picking at a slice of banana bread more as if he wanted something to do than because he was actually hungry.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what is it that\u2019s bothering you?\u201d she asked. \u201cPre-wedding jitters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Yes. We\u2019ve worked through those, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed you brooding lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugged. \u201cI wanted to. But Ron said to leave you two to work it out between yourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth tightened as if he was angry about something. It was subtle, but she\u2019d been his friend for years and knew the signs of him trying to bite down an angry comment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou listened to him, kept your mouth shut? Just like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>She rested a hand on top of Harry\u2019s and gave it a worried squeeze. \u201cAre you okay? I thought it was good advice \u2013 you seem to have settled things with Ginny. You both look happier. The wedding\u2019s still on. But if you want to talk, I\u2019m here for you. Is there something I can do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you answer some questions for me?\u201d he said with a faint pleading tone to his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel about Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face lit up with happiness. \u201cI love him. It\u2019s like we\u2019re two halves of a whole \u2013 like together we\u2019re better. Soulmates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry ate a tiny piece of banana bread and looked at her worriedly. \u201cDo you remember how he used to drive you crazy with how you had to nag him to study? How he left his homework to the last minute, and then wanted to copy yours? He\u2019s been slacking off in Auror training a bit. How do you feel about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed lightly. \u201cHe <em>does</em> leave things to the last minute still, the big goof,\u201d she said affectionately. \u201cI help him practice a bit, but I\u2019ve grown, Harry. I know sometimes it\u2019s best to leave someone to make their own way in the world. I let him make his own choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you do the home assignments for him? Researching legal precedents? Case histories?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe does need a bit of help, so I pitch in when he asks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that makes you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything he does makes me happy,\u201d she said with a sappy smile. \u201cHe might not be perfect, but he\u2019s perfect for <em>me</em>. We balance each other out.\u201d She sipped at her coffee contentedly, enjoying the bittersweet spicy taste that no retailer in the wizarding world bothered to try and duplicate. There it was almost always tea, Butterbeer, or strong liquor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re talking about marriage, kids,\u201d he said leadingly, with a frown. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to focus on a career?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do\u2026 I did\u2026\u201d she said, a frown crossing her face for a moment as she thought about it, before her face cleared with a smile, like the sun emerging from behind the clouds. \u201cBut it would make Ron so happy, and I guess it would be nice to have kids one day. I think he\u2019s going to propose after your wedding. He doesn\u2019t want to steal your thunder.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled softly at the thought. She\u2019d seen where he\u2019d hidden the ring amongst his socks, while putting away his laundry. A princess-cut sapphire solitaire in a gold band. He thought he was so sneaky \u2013 it was adorable.</p>\n<p>Harry was watching her intently as she spoke. So intently it reminded her of Professor Snape for a moment \u2013 the way his eyes would blaze like he was trying to get inside your head. Snape probably had been, given his talents in Legilimency. She was never quite sure in retrospect how she\u2019d managed to get away with stealing the ingredients to brew the Polyjuice Potion in second year. It was most likely because he was too busy suspecting Harry to rifle through her own mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was talking with Ron the other day. He said you\u2019ll be quitting your job once the first baby comes along. He\u2019s looking forward to it \u2013 having a family with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a flash of anger burning for a moment with a flickering thought \u2013 <em>how dare he</em> \u2013 before it was gone. She loved him. That would always come first. They would work any little problems out together. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll work it out when the time comes. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked upset. Too upset. Something was wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay? You\u2019ve always seemed really happy for us? I hope you\u2019re not feeling jealous? I know you and Ginny have been going through a rough patch, but you\u2019ll work it out. Love will find a way.\u201d She was worried for him, and hoped something in her rambling would help. \u201cYou two are meant to be together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry fumbled in a pocket, and placed a wax-sealed crystal potions vial on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA choice,\u201d he said, pushing it towards her. The clear liquid inside sloshed about as the vial rolled over and over before stopping with a gentle clink against her coffee cup.</p>\n<p>She picked it up. No markings, no label.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to drink it,\u201d he said, a world of nervous stubbornness in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after you\u2019ve drunk it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed, but he didn\u2019t laugh with her.</p>\n<p>He looked at her with a serious gaze. \u201cDo you trust me, Hermione? We\u2019ve been friends ever since I shoved my wand up a troll\u2019s nose. I want you to do this for me, without asking questions until afterwards. I want you to drink the potion. Then I\u2019ll tell you what it is. Trust me, <em>please</em>,\u201d he said, stubbornness turning into pleading by the end of his spiel.</p>\n<p>Did she trust him? Yes. He didn\u2019t have a malicious bone in his body. Well, with certain exceptions such as for Bellatrix Lestrange. Maybe Draco too, though that old enmity had died away of late.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did we brew Polyjuice?\u201d she asked, throwing out a question for him to confirm his identity with. Old war-time habits died hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom,\u201d he said with relief. \u201cAnd you were going to be Millicent, but ended up with a cat hair by mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>She picked up the vial, and uncorked it. \u201cCheers, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>She quaffed it in one quick gulp. It didn\u2019t taste bad at all \u2013 not really like anything, actually. Probably not a poison. But nothing she was familiar with.</p>\n<p>\u201cVeritaserum diluted in water?\u201d she guessed. Colourless and flavourless, it was a possibility, though there was a faint mineral taste she didn\u2019t recognise.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d he said, with a shake of his head, and a nervous look. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it though. I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis had better not be one of George\u2019s new creations,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cYou know we\u2019re in the middle of a Muggle caf\u00e9. If I suddenly sprout feathers or spontaneously tap-dancing the fallout is all on you, Mr. Auror.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t have any visible effects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me what it is for Merlin\u2019s sake,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grinned briefly at her. \u201cYes, you caught me. But it should only take a minute or two for the potion to take effect. Patience.\u201d</p>\n<p>She huffed impatiently at him, folding her arms crossly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a clue. Ron took this potion in sixth year. Professor Slughorn gave it to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt had better not be poison, Harry,\u201d she said with a smile. She didn\u2019t think it was, of course. She trusted him implicitly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. Quite the opposite in face. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s an antidote.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHas someone been poisoning me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he hedged.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm\u2026 an antidote in sixth year. Some kind of essence of Bezoar? No, of course not. Wait! The love potion antidote!\u201d she said in quiet triumph, so as to not be overheard by people at the nearby tables.</p>\n<p>He nodded, sadness in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why-\u201d she started, before her face crumpled in agonised realisation as the antidote started kicking in. \u201cRon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I mean, maybe. I suspected after\u2026 I thought maybe you needed the chance \u2013 to see things clearly. So I bought the antidote\u2026 just in case. How do you feel about him now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRon is\u2026\u201d her thoughts whirled. She loved him! She\u2026 loved him. The way he used her to write his assignments. The way he snored was adorable\u2026 no, <em>irritating</em>. She remembered how she\u2019d broken up with him \u2013 he\u2019d walked out on her after all, even with Snatchers and Voldemort\u2019s entire army after her and Harry, and the fate of the wizarding world at stake. She\u2019d been so angry and determined \u2013 it was over, for good. Then after the Battle of Hogwarts, he\u2019d apologised. With chocolates.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d she screamed, and somewhere in the caf\u00e9 a cup fell on the ground and smashed as someone startled at the noise. Patrons turned to look at them as she yelled out her anger and despair, clutching at her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh!\u201d hissed Harry desperately, looking around worriedly as people stared.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, Harry he drugged me!\u201d she yelled at him, clutching at the front of his shirt in desperation. \u201cHe drugged me and I <em>slept</em> with him! He raped me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh\u2026 shhh\u2026 You\u2019re alright now. You can leave him if you want to,\u201d Harry reassured her, while all around them people listened into the drama unfolding in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf someone slipped a mickey in your drink, you should report that bastard to the police!\u201d yelled a plump woman at another table next to them, earning herself a murmur of support from some of the other nearby eavesdropping customers.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave him if I <em>want</em> to? Why would I stay with him? He\u2019s <em>dead to me now</em>!\u201d All the love had drained out of her. She didn\u2019t feel empty, though she\u2019d always used to feel like her life would be empty without Ron\u2019s love. She felt <em>angry</em>.</p>\n<p>The supportive woman at the next table bought her a slice of chocolate gateau, and a friendly hug, both of which she accepted, still rattled and shaking ever so slightly. She attacked the slice of cake ravenously. Ron didn\u2019t like her eating too much. He didn\u2019t want her getting fat. Never mind how much <em>he</em> ate. Just this once wouldn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to her figure. She <em>deserved</em> chocolate gateau right now.</p>\n<p>When she heard exactly why Harry had started suspecting Ron, that Ginny had been drugging Harry too, she wept tears for him that she wasn\u2019t quite ready to shed for herself.</p>\n<p>The anger came back in a comforting rush to dull and plaster over the grief when she heard that Harry planned to stay with Ginny anyway, and that the wizarding world didn\u2019t class love potions as illegal. Both things were almost incomprehensible.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I could if I wanted to press charges of attempted line theft, and entrapment into marriage by means of a potion or spell,\u201d Harry explained softly. \u201cI looked into it. They won\u2019t apply once I\u2019ve married Ginny of my own free will, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You mustn\u2019t! She doesn\u2019t deserve that. She deserves Azkaban,\u201d hissed Hermione.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I still\u2026 care for her. Maybe not love. But still\u2026 I want a family, Hermione. A real family. And she loves me \u2013 she really does. She just went about things the wrong way. We\u2019re working on our relationship. She\u2019s apologised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to press charges against Ron.\u201d</p>\n<p>She expected his support, but what she got was a shake of the head. \u201cYou could try, but as you\u2019ve neither been entrapped into marriage nor made pregnant, and you\u2019re not from a \u2018Noble\u2019 or \u2018Ancient\u2019 family whose line of inheritance is at stake, I think you\u2019ll find there\u2019s actually no charges that will stick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Seriously? Rape, then. I will press charges for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, I looked into it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t count. They don\u2019t even consider Amortentia illegal, and it\u2019s the strongest love potion there is. Morally wrong and sometimes frowned upon, but not technically illegal. That\u2019s why Romilda Vane didn\u2019t even get a detention. That\u2019s why George can sell various types of love potions in his shop. You just tend to get people saying people should be more careful in what they eat, and take antidotes regularly if they\u2019re worried. There\u2019s a lot of victim blaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d she hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t make the laws,\u201d Harry said apologetically.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, and squeezed his hand. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve said it yet \u2013 thank you, Harry. Thank you for being the only person to notice and care that things might not be right. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t think of it sooner,\u201d he said anxiously, and she murmured reassurances to him for a while. He always did tend to blame himself whenever something went wrong. He wanted to save everyone \u2013 always had.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was her turn to save him now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to leave her. Don\u2019t tell me you love her. And we\u2019ll tell their parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d Harry said with a shake of his head. \u201cMolly and Arthur have been through enough, and it\u2019s not their fault. And besides, they\u2019d probably just think it\u2019s romantic\u2026 though sad that you\u2019re breaking up with Ron. Remember how Molly said she used one on Arthur? You laughed about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Hermione felt sick to her stomach. She\u2019d <em>laughed</em>. She\u2019d heard about Molly dosing Arthur with a mild love potion to get him to notice her, and she and Ginny had giggled about it together. It seemed cute. Because it had all turned out happily in the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019d just <em>said</em> something!\u201d she said, anguished. \u201cSpoken up against it. How wrong it was. I wasn\u2019t <em>thinking</em> and so she thought it was all cute and romantic and so she started dosing you until you went out with her! Oh my god, it\u2019s my fault too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll all be okay,\u201d he said, but she didn\u2019t believe him.</p>\n<p>He listened to her apologies with an instant offer of forgiveness, but he wouldn\u2019t listen to her about leaving Ginny or cancelling the wedding, no matter how she argued or how logical her arguments. He explained in hushed whispers about his theory that he was incapable of love. She argued that even if it was true it didn\u2019t mean he should marry <em>that woman</em> \u2013 there were other, better women out there.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d he said with the stubbornness she knew of old. Eventually he refused to discuss it with her anymore. \u201cTalk to Bill. Maybe he can explain it better than I can. He\u2019s the same as me \u2013 conceived while one of his parents was under the effects of a love potion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBill? But he and Fleur are in love \u2013 happily married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. Talk to him. And if you want to repay me for giving you the antidote\u2026 please don\u2019t shame Ginny. I don\u2019t want this to go public.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighed, and nodded, and his relief at that was scant repayment for the tremendous \u2013 though painful \u2013 favour he\u2019d just done her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t protect Ron,\u201d she warned. \u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t ask that of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>He might understand her, but she didn\u2019t understand him. She would try talking to Bill. Perhaps he\u2019d have some insights into this craziness of Harry\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Ron had been bewildered when Hermione had swept through their shared cottage like a hurricane, clothes and belongings literally flying through the air as she swished her wand and sent everything she owned (or could plausibly lay claim to) swishing into a couple of trunks. They had Expansion Charms on them, and after work finished on the very day she\u2019d met up with Harry she\u2019d bought them expressly for the purpose of helping her move out as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ron said, ducking for cover as books flew through the air around in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the emergency?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving you, Ronald Weasley! And if you try anything I will hex your bollocks off, and <em>laugh</em>, so don\u2019t even <em>think</em> about drawing your wand,\u201d she warned, fury in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d he said hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em>!\u201d she screamed, swishing her wand to shrink down the empty bookcase, before stowing it in a trunk as well.</p>\n<p>He looked nervous, \u201cIf this is about having lunch with Lavender, I assure you it was just as friends. I\u2019d even take Veritaserum to prove it \u2013 nothing happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed bitterly, and with her hair wild and a mad gleam in her eyes she looked too intimidating for him to even think about drawing his wand, or doing anything but standing very still, frozen like prey that doesn\u2019t want to draw a predator\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who you sleep with. Not anymore. You can go fuck anyone you like \u2013 just not <em>me</em>. Preferably<em>, go fuck yourself</em>. You foul, despicable excuse for a human being. You <em>drugged me</em>. With a love potion. You fucking rapist!\u201d</p>\n<p>He paled, freckles standing out sharply. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that \u2013 I love you! It was just to enhance what we already-\u201d</p>\n<p>With a swish of her wand and a muttered incantation his pitiful attempt at an explanation was cut short as he started noisily vomiting up a continuous stream of slugs. She summoned away his wand as extra insurance.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou. Will. Shut. Up!\u201d she hissed angrily. \u201cYou can just stay there and vomit up slugs. I\u2019m going to pack. I\u2019m going to leave. And you will never speak to me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron scurried to the sink and stayed there while she finished her furious packing \u2013 the spell was too intense for him to get out more than a gasp of air or a couple of words before another batch of slugs came gushing out his mouth with an ooze of slimy liquid.</p>\n<p>Eventually she faced him again in the kitchen, where he held onto the sink desperately as spasms wracked his body as the tidal wave of slugs kept coming.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermion- Bleurgh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove y- Blllehhhh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought about snapping your wand, but I\u2019m better than that. Better than you. I did throw your wand down the toilet, however. I didn\u2019t flush, so have fun getting it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me pl- Blarrrrgh!\u201d The soft plopping noises of slugs falling into the sink was repulsive.\u00a0 Just like he was.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be telling everyone what you did. You\u2019ll never have another chance to drug a woman into caring for you ever again. I hope you end your life sad and alone. Preferably soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-! Bleurrrrrgh!\u201d</p>\n<p>The two trunks floated out the door behind her, which slammed shut behind her. She was done with Ron. No, she was done with <em>Weasley</em>.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>On a sandy cliff in Cornwall overlooking the sea, not far from Seashell Cottage, Hermione sat next to Bill Weasley, watching the ocean together and chatting amicably. The sky was grey and overcast, so the water wasn\u2019t postcard-blue. But the ebb and flow of the ocean waves was still a beautiful and calming sight, and the noise of the waves and the cries of the seagulls were soothing, like white noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Harry told you about me, then. I <em>did</em> ask him to keep it quiet,\u201d Bill said, with thinly masked irritation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess he thought I needed to know. Ron\u2026 Ron has been dosing me with love potions,\u201d she admitted quietly. Though she was trying to stay calm and just state the facts, anger still seeped through her voice, and could be seen in the tightness of her lips and the clenching of her hands.</p>\n<p>Bill glanced down at her flat belly. \u201cAre you expecting? Are tentative congratulations in order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, with slightly less certainty. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be. We\u2019ve been careful. I\u2019ll know in a week\u2019s time for sure, one way or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she asked grumpily.</p>\n<p>He looked at her warily. \u201cIt\u2019s a general apology. It always works well with Fleur. Whatever I said that was wrong, I apologise for.\u201d</p>\n<p>A small smile snuck out, almost against her will. She liked her anger \u2013 tried to hold onto it as much as possible. It kept the tears away. She peeked at Bill \u2013 his bright blue eyes shone with humour, and he was still a handsome man despite the scars across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see why she likes you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a married man!\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou missed your chance. Besides, Ron would combust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRon,\u201d she said with a scowl, the familiar warmth of anger filling her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bill said uncomfortably, \u201cwhat did you want to know? Why mum did it? What it meant for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe latter. Specifically, why it seems like you\u2019re so in love with Fleur, when the literature \u2013 what little there is on the topic \u2013 says that you should be unable to love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd can I trust you to keep this discussion confidential?\u201d</p>\n<p>She thought about it for a moment. \u201cCan I talk about it with Harry? If I need to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill nodded after a moment. \u201cYes, I suppose so. But no-one else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you might know that mum got pregnant with me quite young. I don\u2019t want to go into how or why, but dad was under the effects of a love potion at the time. Not that mum believes it affected me, mind you. We talked about it a couple of times, but I could never convince her there was anything wrong. I dated a few girls at Hogwarts, you see. Said how crazy I was about them. So she thought everything was fine.\u201d He wrapped his arms around his legs and gazed out at the waves crashing against the short, as they talked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I just dated because that was what you did. I never really felt anything for them. A few kisses, plenty of hand-holding. I made out in a few broom closets, and had one very uncomfortable make-out session up the top of the Astronomy Tower that I eventually ended by pretending I heard Filch coming past on a patrol. I even tried making out with a guy once in case that was it \u2013 nothing. I never told mum about <em>that</em>, of course. Good wizards don\u2019t shame their families like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t apply to me anyway. I\u2019m not gay. I wasn\u2019t anything, and I was trying to accept that and be content with it. It was good enough. Until I met Fleur.\u201d His eyes lit up with joy as he spoke about her.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was different. From the moment I saw her. I felt a spark, just like people talked about. I was drawn to her \u2013 excited. I wanted her to notice me. She of course thought I was suave and cool \u2013 not bumbling around trying to impress her like all the other idiots. She thinks I\u2019m partially immune to her charms, strong of will - and I\u2019d like things to stay that way so please don\u2019t tell her otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you come clean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione thought about it \u2013 what to say that wouldn\u2019t offend. \u201cShe should know the truth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll tell her one day,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mouth tightened. Another Weasley manipulating his relationship regardless of what his partner wanted. At least this one was only drugging himself\u2026 as far as she knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, the point is with her allure from being part-Veela, I love her. Like I can never love anyone else. I don\u2019t want to lose that. You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to go through life feeling <em>nothing</em> for anyone else. I\u2019ve dated people I said I cared for, but I wouldn\u2019t have died for them. Well, out of logical choice I might risk my life, but not from love. But I would die for Fleur. Do you understand? She makes me a better person. I would do anything to make her happy. I\u2019m not alone in the world anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI see.\u201d It wasn\u2019t so much him manipulating Fleur, as him permitting her to manipulate him. Into <em>feeling</em>. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it could be that bad.\u201d She still thought he should confess, but it didn\u2019t sound like he was hurting Fleur \u2013 he really did love her.</p>\n<p>He picked at a blade of grass, shredding it slowly and letting the pieces drift away to the ocean on the breeze. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain what it\u2019s like. I can\u2019t really compare it to anything else \u2013 I don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m just running off what\u2019s in books. What people say. I try to compare it to what I feel for my family, but I don\u2019t know if other people love their parents and siblings more than I do \u2013 how can I judge that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione kept her voice carefully neutral as she asked her next question, \u201cIf Fleur threatened to leave you, would you give her a love potion to make her stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I hate those things. You can\u2019t understand how much I hate them,\u201d he said, blue eyes sparkling with anger. \u201cI\u2019d beg her to stay. Promise her anything. I\u2019d die without her \u2013 I\u2019d willingly take myself from this world rather than live without her love. But I would never do that to her. How could I forgive myself if we brought a child into the world to suffer the emptiness I lived with my whole existence, before my precious flower brought me to true life?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA general sorry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll purpose,\u201d she said with a quirk of a smile. \u201cFor everything I said that upset you just now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. And I\u2019m sorry about Ron. Want me to punch him for you? Kick him in the nads? Big brother\u2019s privilege \u2013 I\u2019m allowed to without him getting all junior Auror on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Thanks though. I\u2019ll get revenge my own way.\u201d</p>\n<p>She understood Harry\u2019s desperation to stay with Ginny a little better now. Never having had love, perhaps of <em>any </em>kind (damn those Dursleys) he was clinging to what little he had. Harry was right \u2013 talking to Bill had helped.</p>\n<p>She still didn\u2019t like it, but would <em>try</em> to respect his wish to butt out of his relationship (pitiful mistake though it was), and leave Ginny alone. The instant Harry changed his mind the gloves would come off, though.</p>\n<p>Ron, now \u2013 that was another matter. She was going to make his life as miserable as possible. She\u2019d started by moving out, obviously. After her first night at the Leaky Cauldron with her life packed in a couple of trunks, she\u2019d found a poky little apartment in Diagon Alley to stay in. It was pretty unimpressive \u2013 nothing much to speak of with a kitchen straight out of the 1920\u2019s and grime that hinted that maybe the apartment hadn\u2019t been cleaned since it was built. In the tiny bathroom there was a claw-footed old enamel bathtub she had to fill by hand or with the wave of her wand as there wasn\u2019t any plumbing for it. She\u2019d wanted something fast, and there wasn\u2019t much on offer in Diagon Alley at any given moment in time \u2013 she wasn\u2019t the only one who liked the convenience of living there. She didn\u2019t really enjoy the sensation of Apparating, and it was handy to be able to walk to walk at her office at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or out into the middle of London.</p>\n<p>And she\u2019d told everyone what <em>Weasley</em> had done. Even Rita Skeeter, who was genuinely delighted with the unexpected windfall of dirt and promised it would be her pleasure to drag his name through the mud in the papers. But it wasn\u2019t enough for the fire that still burned inside her.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d also gone to George\u2019s shop, bought out his entire stock of love potions, and smashed them on the floor of his shop in front of him, one by one, while telling him in detail just what she thought of \u201clove\u201d potions, and his rapist brother. She\u2019d thought about smashing them <em>without</em> buying them, but didn\u2019t want to be arrested for vandalism. By the end of her tirade, with pink fumes rising into the air around him and shattered glass all around her feet, George proclaimed his undying love for her and fell to his knees with a painful crunch on the shards of broken glass to beg her to marry him. (She was unaffected \u2013 she was taking the antidote regularly at the moment \u2013 just in case.)</p>\n<p>She hoped it would teach him a valuable lesson, and was kind enough to insist that he take an antidote \u2013 <em>for her</em>. After he had, he just stared at her for a while, blood seeping through his pants where his knees had been cut to ribbons by the broken glass, before muttering a brief apology. She swept out of the shop, triumphant, while people scurried to get out of her way.</p>\n<p>Ron \u2013 <em>Weasley</em> she reminded herself \u2013 sent her an owl a few days after she\u2019d left. It was heavy on justifications, and light on apology. He was sure she still loved him deep down, and that they should get together to talk. He said they could still fix this. She crumpled the parchment into a ball and set it on fire. He was going to <em>pay</em>. And she knew just what kind of revenge would hurt him the most.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco, I want you to date me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed at first, shoulders shaking. \u201cReally now. My horoscope did say an unexpected surprise was in store for me today. Seriously now Granger, why are you here? A donation to your cause for creature rights? Some kind of quid pro quo arrangement for political support?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her hands clenched on the wooden chair arms as she sat in front of his desk. \u201cI\u2019m serious. Well, sort of serious. I want us to date for a while. You don\u2019t have to commit to a long-term relationship. Or actually be interested in me in any way. I understand you\u2019ve been slowly courting Astoria Greengrass \u2013 or so <em>Witch Weekly</em> claims. So long as you\u2019re not currently engaged or exclusively dating her, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d date me for just a couple of months, then we can break up and you\u2019re absolutely free to return to her arms. Being seen with me would do wonders for your shaky public image. I can speak up for you in public \u2013 how you\u2019ve turned over a new leaf, how you deeply regret your actions in the war. Your apologies will sound more convincing coming from my lips \u2013 you can keep your pride and I\u2019ll be humble on your behalf. I have contacts in the Ministry that could be advantageous for assisting your business or political interests. Dating me would do more for your image than thousands of Galleons donated to St. Mungo\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leant back on his plush velvet chair and looked at her thoughtfully. She sat nervously opposite him on the other side of his desk. She\u2019d hated having to come to Malfoy Manor, but needs must, despite the bad memories the place held. She had a plan. And Draco was the key.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you really want here, Granger? You\u2019ve explained what\u2019s in it for me \u2013 very thoughtful of you. You\u2019re calm and concise, like you prepared a script for this in advance. But what\u2019s in it for you? Surely you\u2019re not claiming you\u2019re secretly in love with me? Those were not the words of a woman admitting a hidden passion,\u201d he stated, looking deeply sceptical and suspicious.</p>\n<p>She hesitated for a moment, but let honesty and anger spill unpractised words out of her mouth like poison, more bitter with every sentence that fell from her lips. \u201cRevenge. I want Ronald Weasley to hurt, like he hurt me. I want him so angry his ears turn red when he thinks of us. I want him to know that he\u2019s second-best in everything. That he lost to Draco Malfoy, of all people. I want spittle to fly out of his mouth when he rages at the sight of his former girlfriend \u2013 almost his fianc\u00e9e \u2013 eating out at a restaurant he could never afford. I want him to see that he\u2019s scum. Too far beneath me. For him to see that you \u2013 whom he hated above all other boys at Hogwarts \u2013 possess me when he does not and that I think you\u2019re <em>better</em> than him. I want you to sneer and pose at him and make him incandescent with jealousy and anger, until he demands I leave with him, or begs me to come back, but I sneer too and then he knows that he is <em>nothing</em> to me now. I want the world to see Weasley brought low.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her voice grew angrier the more she spoke, and Draco\u2019s smile grew more with every word until at the end he laughed with sheer malicious delight at the enticing picture she painted.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Granger, how could I say no to such a delightful scheme?! And what did the Weasel do to earn this ire? Did he cheat on you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em>drugged</em> me,\u201d she yelled. \u201cDosed me with love potions for <em>years</em> until I forgot how much he annoyed me, how much I missed talking to Victor, how I valued my career! Made me love his stupid freckled face and made me forget how I hated the way he keeps his mouth open when he eats, and cheats and lazes his way through life! It might be tolerable in a friend but I <em>never</em> wanted to sleep with him! Not after the way he walked out on me and Harry in the forest! That was it, and I broke up with him, and he just <em>drugged me back into compliance! Into his bed!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>She panted angrily as she caught her breath, but Draco wasn\u2019t laughing now.</p>\n<p>\u201cGranger\u2026 Hermione,\u201d he said, leaning towards her with a serious look. \u201cI\u2019ll help you make him pay. He deserves it. A little mild potion to make someone notice you who wouldn\u2019t give you a second glance, maybe. But that? Stealing your maidenhead? No. No, the man is less than the mud on my boots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStealing my what?\u201d she said with a shaky laugh. \u201cNo. I lost my virginity to Victor back in fifth year. But what Ron did was no less bad because of that. He <em>thought</em> he was my first. I let him think it \u2013 tolerated his fumbling hands and let him take the lead. I loved him, after all. But it wasn\u2019t love. It was rape \u2013 what he did to me. I just didn\u2019t know it at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA man should never force a woman\u2019s affections like that,\u201d said Draco with anger in his voice. Anger for <em>her</em>. It warmed her. \u201cI shall help you make him pay for that.\u201d He took her hand, and raised it slowly to his lips, laying a gentle testing kiss on her knuckles. His mouth was soft and warm, and while it didn\u2019t thrill her, his touch didn\u2019t repulse her like the thought of Ron did. Thoughts of Ron just sickened her now \u2013 the memory of his grunting thrusts atop her made her want to vomit.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s voice drew her back to the present, pushing the intrusive memory away. \u201cIt would be my pleasure to help you. Just say how we shall begin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione let out a long relieved sigh. She wasn\u2019t going to be rejected and humiliated. Her gamble was paying off after all. \u201cIt\u2019s a ten step plan. I have notes,\u201d she said, opening up her briefcase.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Draco said, amusement twinkling in his grey eyes as she explained the first step where he was to buy her an expensive bouquet of flowers and \u201caccidentally\u201d let slip who they were for, in front of anyone he knew to be a dreadful gossip.</p>\n<p>The second step was going to be a public date. She realised she was looking forward to it, and the public snubbing she hoped she might be able to give Ron. And if he didn\u2019t show up to try and interrupt her \u201cfirst date\u201d with Draco, well, there were still eight more steps and he was sure to bite sooner or later. The longer it went on the more convincing it would be.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>They held hands across the candlelit table, while around them people watched them curiously. What was <em>Hermione Granger</em> doing at a romantic table for two at <em>Epicure</em>, Diagon Alley\u2019s newest and most exclusive restaurant? With <em>Draco Malfoy</em> of all people?</p>\n<p>He\u2019d looked at her with obvious and open admiration when he\u2019d seen her, and pulled out her chair for her to sit, tucking her back in awkwardly as she scooted the chair inexpertly in to the table. What was the point of pulling out a woman\u2019s chair for her? Hermione was quite capable of doing it herself. Still, she supposed it all helped to send the message she wanted to all the gossipy crowd of diners watching them \u2013 Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy were clearly out on a date together. There wasn\u2019t anyone there she recognised, but it was a start. Well, it was step two, technically, and she had a large bouquet of roses sitting in a transfigured vase at home to prove it. If they moved too fast, Ron wouldn\u2019t believe it. And she wanted him to be fooled into thinking her make-believe romance with Draco was genuine. If he thought it was fake, he wouldn\u2019t suffer as much.</p>\n<p>They made small talk for a while, about the weather, the menu, and her work at the Ministry in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures working on improving the rights of underprivileged non-humans. He complimented her dress. She complimented his choice of wine (really she had no idea \u2013 she didn\u2019t even <em>like</em> wine that much).</p>\n<p>Over dessert, he leant over next to her with his hand on her shoulder to whisper in her ear, \u201cLaugh and hit gently at my shoulder like I just said something <em>very</em> naughty.\u201d His breath tickled her ear as he spoke, making her shiver.</p>\n<p>She pulled away with a mostly genuine laugh, and pushed him away gently with one hand on his chest. \u201cDraco! You can\u2019t be serious! We\u2019re in a <em>restaurant</em>!\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>He smirked at her, and let his eyes linger on her cleavage, breasts on display in a brand new red velvet dress with a low neckline bought specially for the occasion of their first date. \u201cMaybe later then,\u201d he purred, taking her hand off his chest to play with her fingers, rubbing his thumb over them. He planted a kiss in the palm of her hand before letting it go.</p>\n<p>Hermione glanced around, and noticed Pansy Parkinson passing by, turning away to gossip with a friend when she saw Hermione looking at her. Hermione blushed \u2013 she couldn\u2019t help it. Everyone was going to think she was sleeping with Draco. She wavered for a moment in her thoughts wondering what the hell she was doing, before the memory of Ron\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d morning cup of tea he brought for her while still in bed reminded her why she was doing this. Nothing mattered more to her right now than getting revenge. And she could always dump Draco in some horribly humiliating way if he crossed a line. So far though, he was a polite and willing conspirator. It would probably be best if they just \u201cparted as friends\u201d after their flirtation had served its purpose.</p>\n<p>Hermione kind of hoped she could keep the truth behind her arrangement with Draco secret. She hadn\u2019t even told Harry \u2013 Ron knew him too well, and Harry\u2019s attempts at lies could be kind of pathetic sometimes. She didn\u2019t want to keep this from him, but felt that she had to (at least until she\u2019d gotten her revenge on Ron). The risk he\u2019d give her plan away was too high. He wrote to her saying he\u2019d started hearing gossip that she was dating Draco, and asked if she was happy. He also let her know that George had complained a bit about her smashing his stock of love potions, but had gone quiet when Harry had simply responded, \u201cGood for her.\u201d Hermione had written back that while she wasn\u2019t truly happy yet, she was getting there. And yes, definitely not drugged this time because she was taking antidotes occasionally, and had also bought a toadstone ring (using up almost all her savings) to detect poisons and potions in her food. She wrote reassuringly about how being with Draco was helping her feel better about things, and he was a surprisingly kind and thoughtful date.</p>\n<p>Ron had owled her too, complaining at length about her article in the Daily Prophet about him, and ranting generally about how he knew it had to be fake.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI know you\u2019re only dating Draco out of spite, because I <strong>know</strong> you can\u2019t stand him any more than I can. Clearly you\u2019re just trying to make me jealous, and that\u2019s childish of you and it won\u2019t work. You\u2019re just making yourself look ridiculous and cheap. You\u2019d better cut it out immediately and apologise if you want any chance of us getting back together.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>In regards to guessing correcting that they weren\u2019t really dating she had to grudgingly give Ron credit that sometimes he was smarter than he looked, though his ridiculous assumption that she\u2019d want to reconcile made her livid. She\u2019d have to try harder, until that smug superiority was washed away completely in angry jealousy. She had a start, she just needed to capitalise on it.</p>\n<p>The news of her dating Draco hadn\u2019t featured in <em>Witch Weekly</em> yet, but she hoped it would do so soon.</p>\n<p>Of course, with the spread of gossip came consequences \u2013 not all of them what she\u2019d wanted. And as she knocked on the door of Malfoy Manor she was very nervous about this one. Draco\u2019s parents had heard about them dating, and wanted to meet her. There was surely no way this could go well.</p>\n<p>She was met at the door by Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, welcome. Or should I use a pet name? My \u2018little bookworm\u2019, perhaps?\u201d he asked with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione will do just fine on its own I think, thank you,\u201d she said, then paused before adding, \u201cbut you may use \u2018Mione on occasion if you want to irritate Ron. When he\u2019s not around I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t, however.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on in, my parents are waiting in the breakfast room. But don\u2019t worry too much,\u201d he said in a soothing tone of voice as he opened the door for her, leading her in with a hand pressed to the small of her back.</p>\n<p>It was all jarringly different from the last time she\u2019d encountered Lucius Malfoy in his home. He smiled pleasantly at her, for a start. To her surprise it was Narcissa who seemed less pleased to see her, and looked her up and down in a way that made Hermione instantly wonder what was wrong with her robes and if she had something on her face.</p>\n<p>They went through the hollow courtesies of greeting that had always bored Hermione, before Draco to her relief cut the chit-chat short by getting down to business.</p>\n<p>\u201cI explained to mother and father that your interest in me isn\u2019t serious, and that your focus is on getting revenge on Weasley,\u201d he said, the admission startling her. They hadn\u2019t discussed letting anyone else know.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told them?\u201d she asked with a frown.</p>\n<p>Narcissa looked down her nose at Hermione as she said, \u201cYou can <em>hardly</em> think we would celebrate Draco breaking off his most promising courtship of Miss Astoria Greengrass in order to go out on a date with you. Explanations were required.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco reached out for a scone off a platter and spread it with jam and a dollop of whipped cream, seeming very nonchalant. \u201cAstoria understood. She will keep quiet, and wait for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Mr Malfoy. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think Miss Granger that we are unaware or unappreciative of the unparalleled opportunity you have offered not just to Draco, but to our whole family.\u201d He directed a rebuking look at his wife, who avoided eye contact with a tiny frown of pursed lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wished to let you formally know,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat we will be presenting a unified front to the public, supporting your \u2018relationship\u2019 with Draco. No unkind word in regards to the unfortunate circumstance of your birth shall cross my lips \u2013 we will be stating our utmost regard for our son\u2019s happiness and our respect for your intelligence and skills.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAh, I see. I will be the poster child for your reformation \u2013 your opportunity to demonstrate your tolerance of Muggle-borns, proved by your willingness to support a serious relationship between your pure-blood heir and myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly right,\u201d he said with a smug smile, \u201cif bluntly put. And delightfully, it is a relationship without any chance whatsoever of resulting in marriage or\u2026 any other complications.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa\u2019s smile was tight as she took her turn quizzing Hermione. \u201cIt <em>is</em> without any chance of resulting in a child out of wedlock, I hope? There is such a thing as taking an act <em>too</em> far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother! We discussed this!\u201d Draco said with a roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded. \u201cOf course. I understand. We won\u2019t be sleeping together, I promise you. Though we might imply it to others in public, if that\u2019s acceptable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am concerned for my son\u2019s reputation. And the potential impact on his future engagement,\u201d Narcissa said stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be fine, dear,\u201d Lucius said, patting his wife\u2019s hand briefly. \u201cHis reputation will be significantly bettered by this dalliance, and Astoria has promised to wait for him; she\u2019s a most obliging and sincere young woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t discuss our arrangement with anyone else,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cA secret shared amongst too many isn\u2019t a secret for long.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a murmur of agreement \u2013 everyone seemed happy to keep it quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cRest assured the news won\u2019t go any further,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI\u2019d hardly want to be seen publicly as a schemer. Much better that I be a man in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa frowned again, but said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you again for this opportunity, Miss Granger,\u201d said Lucius smoothly. \u201cAnd might I add that I am interested in supporting your upcoming bill you\u2019ll be presenting to the Wizengamot soon about improved rights for werewolves in regards to employment opportunities, and time off around the full moon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione perked up. This scheme could have more benefits than she\u2019d realised. She chatted eagerly about her proposed changes to legislation, and promised to owl him some background information about it, and a copy of the draft bill.</p>\n<p>After finishing morning tea, the couple were invited to stroll around the grounds together, affording them the opportunity to discuss the next steps in Hermione\u2019s plan. Hermione had a feeling that Narcissa would be watching them through the windows. It was an uncomfortable feeling, but hardly the worst thing she\u2019d suffered through at their manor.</p>\n<p>As they walked further out of sight of the manor along a gravel path and into a manicured herb garden Draco took her arm and linked it with his, so her hand rested in the crook of his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said with surprise. \u201cThere\u2019s no-one to observe us here, surely?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you have a tendency to tense up when I touch you. If you wish to be convincing in this charade, you will need to overcome it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t even noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a subtle thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, this is the proper way for a gentleman to escort his date on a walk. It will look odd if you are unfamiliar with such a simple courtesy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cR- Weasley never did that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeasley has no class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled at her at her prompt agreement. She\u2019d never noticed before, but his grey eyes had a touch of blue in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologise for mother. She worries too much. I think she suspects you\u2019ll try and entrap me into marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re nicer than I thought you were, but not <em>that</em> nice. I understand that I\u2019m interfering with your relationship with Astoria with this charade, and I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe will wait. She understands these games \u2013 she was in Slytherin too after all. A couple of years below us. And it\u2019s worth it, to see Weasley suffer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a reason in particular you hate Ron?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cI mean, we always fought in school, and then there\u2019s the war. Is it that? You don\u2019t seem to hold the same enmity for Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter proved to be surprisingly decent. Honourable. He saved my parents from Azkaban \u2013 that\u2019s not something you can just turn away from. And frankly, when it comes to the Dark Lord \u2013 good riddance. He brought nothing but misery and shame to my family \u2013 we were doing better without him and have yet to completely recoup our status and wealth. So we all owe Potter for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe definitely do,\u201d she agreed, pleasantly surprised by his opinion of Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow Weasley - we\u2019ve been at odds ever since he laughed at me on the Hogwarts Express. But if you want a particular example of why, it\u2019s not so much the war. We all did what family and circumstances forced us into, him included. No, it\u2019s about incidents such as the time when he laughed at me for <em>weeks</em> after Professor Moody \u2013 Crouch really \u2013 turned me into a ferret and bashed me against the walls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s lips quirked with amusement. \u201cYou must admit, it <em>was</em> rather funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco sneered at her angrily, \u201cOh really? And what if <em>Potter</em> had been turned into an animal by a teacher? Snape for instance. And then imagine that he was thrown again and again against the stone walls and floor until his wrist shattered and his leg fractured, while Slytherins stood about and laughed at the fun. Would that have been \u2018rather funny\u2019 too? It\u2019s only funny because you don\u2019t truly like me \u2013 this is just a pretence and we both know it. But when it\u2019s someone you favour, that kind of thing is bullying, assault\u2026 evil. When you don\u2019t like the victim it\u2019s just a funny joke, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione blanched. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I never realized. I thought\u2026 we thought he was just kind of bouncing you.\u201d She thought guiltily of how they\u2019d laughed at Draco, the amazing bouncing ferret.</p>\n<p>\u201cFerrets are well known for their ability to bounce off stone unharmed, are they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, we were idiots not to realise,\u201d she admitted shamefacedly.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s anger faded away at her apology, and was replaced with a smirk as he patted her hand where it rested on his arm. \u201cAt last you acknowledge your intellectual inferiority to me. It took you long enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh do shut up,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cSee if I ever apologise for a mistake to you again, you smug prat.\u201d</p>\n<p>He chuckled at that, and she joined in with his infectious laughter. She was starting to get the hang of talking to Draco \u2013 the trick was not to take his words at face value, for a snarky, sarcastic sense of humour underlay many of his statements, and he was usually happily amused if she picked up on that and argued with him instead of getting offended.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if I recall correctly, step three was attracting media attention to our burgeoning relationship?\u201d he asked with an enquiring lilt to his voice. \u201cDo you wish to make a formal statement of some kind, or encourage friends and acquaintances to gossip to the press?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t be a problem. Skeeter will publish what I ask her to. She\u2019ll make it sound like she just heard it as gossip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re such good friends,\u201d he said sceptically, \u201cand she\u2019s well known for being agreeable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have my ways,\u201d she said with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you now? And what comes after Rita\u2019s article?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStep four is a second date, with dancing and increased physical contact. Step five is our third date, where you pick me up from work wearing Muggle clothes. We\u2019ll go out into Muggle London, demonstrating both your serious commitment to me, and also your growing tolerance for all things Muggle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there kissing, on this second date?\u201d he asked, tilting his head and looking at her interestedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we practice?\u201d</p>\n<p>She hesitated a moment to think about it. It would probably be best to have their first kiss in private, rather than on a dance floor. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p>\n<p>He let go of her arm and turned to face her, reaching up a hand to brush along her cheek, making her shiver. Then he wound his fingers through her hair. \u201cI like how you keep your hair smoother, these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, but it looks more professional \u2013 better for work,\u201d she said, feeling a little intimidated by how close he was standing, his face so close to hers. He leant towards her, and kissed her. It was\u2026 nice, she guessed. Warm, and gentle. Then his right hand tightened in her hair, and his other arm went around her waist, and he pulled her close against his body as he deepened the kiss, tongue sliding between her lips to tangle with hers. She moaned softly, involuntarily, and after a couple more kisses he pulled away with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>She took a deep breath. She could hardly believe she\u2019d been kissing <em>Draco Malfoy</em>. \u201cI may as well enjoy it. Better you than Goyle. He wasn\u2019t an appealing option as a second choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head with a smile. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have gone for it. Blaise would have - he\u2019d sleep with anyone, even you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered by your charming endorsement of my desirability as a partner,\u201d she said dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo offence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d she said reassuringly with a pat on his arm, even though he didn\u2019t actually look worried at possibly having offended her. \u201cZabini\u2019s bedroom habits are no concern of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a reputation. But really, I just meant that he would\u2019ve been happy to help out with your scheme too. He would\u2019ve found it funny. The odds of him getting drunk and laughing about it with someone would be a bit high, though \u2013 so probably best not to say anything to him,\u201d Draco mused thoughtfully, thinking it through as he spoke. \u201cWhen you break up with me, if you still want to make the Weasel jealous, you could always simply ask him out. He might try to pressure you into bed, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione thought she didn\u2019t really like the sound of that. Even if Blaise <em>was</em> almost as good-looking as Draco.</p>\n<p>Hermione had assumed there would be some kind of dance club for them to go out to for their second date, but apparently the wizarding world was completely lacking in nightclubs, at least in Britain. And the next <em>Weird Sisters</em> concert was months away. Draco had a suggestion that he thought might suit, however.</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy is throwing a ball for her birthday, and it\u2019s only a week away. I can take you as my date \u2013 we can dance there. Of course the Weasel won\u2019t be invited, but it <em>will</em> be quite the social event, and I assure you your invitation would be quite gossiped about. If you are lucky, he might even try to gatecrash.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pansy was reportedly <em>delighted</em> to add Hermione to the guest list for her party, a claim which Hermione doubted the veracity of, but appreciated all the same for its courtesy. She must at least be over her schoolgirl crush on Draco, to take the news of them dating with such grace. Hermione had <em>no idea</em> what to buy her as a present, and in a burst of inspiration she decided to use her bewilderment as to what gift to buy as an excuse to gossip about her and Draco\u2019s date with Harry, her good friend Susan Bones, some other acquaintances at the Ministry, and of course Luna, Neville, and Hannah. Hannah was Neville\u2019s current girlfriend \u2013 it seemed to be going well with genuine affection between the pair, as best her newly suspicious eye could judge.</p>\n<p>Susan claimed she\u2019d always <em>thought</em> Hermione and Draco would make a good couple (to Hermione\u2019s secret bewilderment), and suggested chocolates or wine for Pansy\u2019s present. Neville suggested a potted plant, of course, while Hannah favoured scented toiletries as a gift. Luna ignored her question and congratulated Hermione on getting rid of her Wrackspurt infestation. Then she hugged her tightly without explanation, and wouldn\u2019t let go despite Hermione\u2019s laughing protestations that she was fine, until finally Hermione broke and clung to her friend as she started crying about what Ron had done, and how broken and soiled she felt. To Hermione\u2019s relief, the fey young woman of uncanny understanding didn\u2019t say anything in Ron\u2019s defence, or judge her. She just hummed soft words of agreement, and continued hugging Hermione more gently until she calmed down. Then she fed Hermione cookies and tea and gossiped brightly about strange magical creatures (that probably didn\u2019t exist) until she was all smiles again. It was an odd relief to let the tears out at last.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t ask Ginny for any advice. She didn\u2019t want to even <em>think</em> about her, let alone talk to her. She\u2019d decided recently that she\u2019d have to pull out of being a bridesmaid, but didn\u2019t know how to break the news about <em>why</em> without ranting about her wrongdoings or skipping straight to hexing the cow (which sadly, Harry would disapprove of).</p>\n<p>In the end she\u2019d chickened out and invited Harry out for coffee, and asked him to talk to Ginny on her behalf. Harry did his best to talk her down from her initially firm stance as he really wanted her to stay in the bridal party, and had instead offered his promise to get Ginny to stop owling her about hairstyles and flowers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll you\u2019ll need to do is just show up,\u201d he pleaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Harry,\u201d she sighed unhappily, \u201cRon is in the bridal party too \u2013 he\u2019s your best man. I don\u2019t want to even sit at the same table as him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry had said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to choose, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re both my best friends in the world,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose either of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after what he did?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slumped. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t actually know how strong the potions were. He thought it just made you more inclined to\u2026 you know. Be in the mood more often.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe lied, Harry,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cHe gave them to me <em>every day</em>. He turned me into a lovesick <em>slave</em> who catered to his every whim. The difference is just\u2026 immense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cI mean, I know. I know he\u2019s lying. And I\u2019m sorry. Really, so very sorry. We\u2019re not talking much at the moment. I\u2019ll tell him he\u2019s out as best man. \u201d He wore a determined look now, though it was tinged with grief at the incipient final loss of his friend. \u201cMaybe you can be my best woman?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione appreciated the firming of Harry\u2019s resolution and support of her. But when she thought about it, she realised after a moment that she didn\u2019t even <em>want</em> to be in the bridal party.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to try and maintain a relationship with him, which I guess you\u2019ll <em>have</em> to as he\u2019ll be your brother-in-law if you\u2019re really going through with your farce of a wedding-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-Don\u2019t call it that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. But it\u2019s true. I guess that\u2019s kind of my point. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I won\u2019t be a good bridesmaid, or best woman. I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to stand up there and force a smile while you go through with your wedding to Ginny. I love you like a brother, Harry \u2013 I just can\u2019t support it. You deserve better than her, you really do. So you may as well stick with Ron as your best man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDead sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll still come to the wedding, won\u2019t you?\u201d he pleaded with big, wide eyes like a hopeful puppy. \u201cYou can bring Malf\u2026 Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Now <strong>that </strong>had potential,</em> she thought to herself. And she couldn\u2019t say no to that cutely imploring face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Weasleys won\u2019t like it. There might be a scene,\u201d she warned. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Ron, George is mad at me too. And you know how angry I am at Ginny. Molly sent me a Howler you know, for saying nasty untrue things about her baby boy to the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugged. \u201cJust don\u2019t make a big scene until after the ceremony is done, if you can manage it. After that, have at it. If that\u2019s the price of my best friend being there at my wedding, so be it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Harry!\u201d she said happily, and he grinned and ducked his head bashfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill friends?\u201d he asked anxiously with a shy smile. \u201cComing to the wedding now?\u201d</p>\n<p>She reached out and squeezed his hand. \u201cI still hate Ginny. And I think this is a mistake. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t support your wedding like I know you want me to. But I can be there for you anyway, and I\u2019ll do my best. It\u2019s what you want, so yes, Draco and I will be there. I\u2019ll even smile at Ginny and tell her how beautiful she looks and how lucky she is \u2013 that\u2019s true at least. We\u2019re still friends, Harry. And if you <em>do </em>change your mind at the last minute about Ginny, I\u2019ll hex the lot of them so hard it\u2019ll give them PTSD flashbacks while you seize your chance to Apparate the hell out of there. Because that\u2019s what a best friend does.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t seem as amused by that half-joking plan as she\u2019d hoped, though he appreciated her general sentiment of wanting to be supportive of him. She cursed herself quietly in her mind for not keeping her big mouth shut. She should\u2019ve just said something vague and supportive and left it at that.</p>\n<p>When she repeated her stupid plan later to Draco, he found it hilarious. He didn\u2019t seem inclined to ask for an explanation of why she hated Ginny, thankfully, which made the conversation easier. She figured he probably just assumed she hated all Weasleys now.</p>\n<p>In the end after a lot of consulting and pondering, after wrapping up her chat with Harry she\u2019d bought a few nice perfumes from a Muggle shop and made up a little perfume gift basket for Pansy.</p>\n<p>And then, after all her effort to think of a good gift, Draco told her that he\u2019d assumed they\u2019d be giving a <em>joint</em> gift.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that in the first place?\u201d she complained, chatting to him that evening via his Floo connection, crouched down on the floor in front of her smoke-stained little fireplace with her head poking through the green flames into his own spacious parlour.</p>\n<p>\u201cI assumed you would know. It\u2019s basic etiquette for dating couples,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not returning my gift,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t <em>ask</em> you to,\u201d he said, tilting his head to one side as he watched her curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to use my gift instead of yours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll simply combine them. I can add my box of imported Belgian chocolates to your gift basket, and re-wrap it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProblem solved,\u201d he said happily, raising his glass of white wine to her like he was toasting her.</p>\n<p>\u201cRon and I didn\u2019t compromise well,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I guess I assumed you\u2019d want your own way. My mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shuddered. \u201cPlease do not confuse me with that pathetic specimen of manhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione laughed, and he grinned back at her amusedly.</p>\n<p>He chatted with her for a little while about the party\u2019s dress code (casual but dressy robes), and what would happen at the party (platters of tiny canap\u00e9s, lots of wine and champagne, and a string quartet that would play music for everyone to dance to).</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not the best dancer,\u201d she warned.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you dance at the Yule ball in fourth year. You were quite graceful and light on your feet. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said reassuringly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou watched me dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Everyone</em> watched you dance. You usually looked so homely, but you were simply stunning that evening. We were all in shock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well thank you,\u201d she said, feeling rather flustered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to disappoint Victor. And I suppose I wanted to show Ron what he was missing out on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smiled at her wickedly, teeth gently biting his bottom lip for a moment. \u201cI hope you find the prospect of a delightful evening in my own company similarly motivating to drive you to new delights of beautification.\u201d</p>\n<p>She wasn\u2019t quite sure if he was serious or not, until some over-the-top seductive eyebrow-wiggling pushed her over the edge into laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll scrub up especially nice, just for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd for Pansy too,\u201d he added with a leer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d she laughed in shock.</p>\n<p>His shoulders quaked with suppressed laughter. \u201cWhy, I mean that you need to show her what a beautiful girlfriend I\u2019ve acquired, and make her terribly jealous. What were <em>you</em> thinking about, you naughty minx?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a horrible, horrible man. You know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI may have had it mentioned to me once or twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>She eventually ended the call with a smile, and slept peacefully that night, her dreams blissfully free of Ron.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Ron was waiting in the Atrium on Level Eight when she finished work on the afternoon of Pansy\u2019s party, standing between the lifts and the line of gaudy Ministry Floos. He was dressed in his Apprentice Auror robes \u2013 scarlet with black trim. She used to think he looked so handsome in them. Now she found herself looking around nervously to see who was around to back her up if there was a nasty confrontation. She thought the security wizard in a peacock blue robe checking wands might be her best bet, but the thought wasn\u2019t terribly reassuring. She put her hand in her robe pocket, resting it lightly on her wand just in case.</p>\n<p>A fight didn\u2019t seem imminent, however, as Ron flourished a bunch of red roses at her, and approached with a friendly air.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Hermione, these are for you,\u201d he said, holding them out to her with a nervous smile, but she didn\u2019t take them, and just let his arm hang their uselessly in mid-air.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think a bunch of roses will fix this? Don\u2019t make me laugh!\u201d This wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She wanted anger. Jealousy. Complete and utter humiliation. The optimistic and rather condescending smile he was wearing now wasn\u2019t the attitude she craved.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve suffered long enough?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hermione. Is that what you wanted to hear? I won\u2019t\u2026 do that again. <em>You know</em>. What I did. So, come home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHome?\u201d she hissed angrily. \u201cI have a home. Away from you. We are <em>over</em>, Ronald Weasley. You drugged me, and raped me, and that\u2019s unforgiveable.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snatched the flowers off him and dashed them to the floor, scattering red petals like blood across the tiled floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a scene,\u201d he chided.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood! You deserve that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I know you still love me deep down-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-Clearly you know <em>nothing</em>, you ignorant louse!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to make me jealous if you didn\u2019t care for me! You\u2019re overreacting. Those potions don\u2019t work unless there\u2019s existing feelings there already to build on.\u201d</p>\n<p>She wavered for a brief moment, lost in memories. She <em>had</em> loved him, once. But no more.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I ever did, that love is dead now,\u201d she said with quiet conviction. \u201cAs is our friendship, for that matter. My affections have turned elsewhere.\u201d She turned her back on him and the wreckage of roses, and stalked off towards the row of fireplaces under the curious eyes of witches and wizards lingering to watch the drama.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t love Malfoy!\u201d Ron yelled after her, trailing behind her. \u201cThis is <em>just</em> like you flirting with Cormac McLaggen in sixth year all over again! You\u2019re making a fool of yourself for nothing because I\u2019m already willing to make up. And of course he doesn\u2019t love you! Not like I do. Come home, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione gleefully realised she had the perfect opportunity to get the last word in before Flooing away.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo-one deserves to be \u2018loved\u2019 like you \u2018loved\u2019 me. That wasn\u2019t love. It was slavery,\u201d she called loudly to him. \u201cAnd <em>Draco</em> knows how to treat a woman right, unlike you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She thrilled at the sight of his outraged eyes at that last dig \u2013 angry at last \u2013 as she disappeared in a flash of green flames.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>It took an hour of effort with spells, hair products, and occasional cursing to wrestle her frizzy locks into sleek sophistication, and another half-hour fussing with rarely used cosmetics, but Draco\u2019s admiring gaze at her stylish appearance made her feel it was worth the extra effort.</p>\n<p>Pansy air-kissed her cheeks on arrival at the Parkinson manor like they were old friends instead of old enemies, and was simply <em>delighted</em> with their gift, and <em>loved</em> Hermione\u2019s forest green dress robes. Even if she wasn\u2019t sincere, she was at least a very polite liar about it all, which was good enough for Hermione.</p>\n<p>Daphne Greengrass was less thrilled by their appearance together, but Draco swept Hermione quickly onto the dancefloor before she could approach. But the confrontation couldn\u2019t be put off forever.</p>\n<p>While Draco was busy getting them both glasses of chilled white wine, Daphne darted over to hiss a warning to Hermione.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too attached,\u201d she warned with a scowl. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to marry you. He\u2019s just <em>using</em> you. He\u2019ll tire of you and your Muggle-born ways soon enough and cast you aside, and then he\u2019ll marry <em>my</em> sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione blinked. Obviously Daphne wasn\u2019t one of the few in the know about the truth behind her and Draco\u2019s arrangement.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not. If what you say is so, then I\u2019ll enjoy it while it lasts,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cCarpe diem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Daphne looked puzzled for a moment, before rallying. \u201cTramp,\u201d spat Daphne, and she swept off angrily.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t bothering you was she?\u201d asked Draco, handing her a glass of wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing I couldn\u2019t deal with,\u201d she assured him.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent. Now, tell me something intimate about yourself that I can taunt Weasel with if he shows up,\u201d Draco whispered into her ear, putting a warm hand on the small of her back as he leaned in close to her. \u201cI heard you two had quite the public spat this afternoon, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he turns up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. Well, I like to take a snack and a book with me when I have a bubble-bath \u2013 it\u2019s one of my favourite ways to relax. Soft cheese and sliced fruit to nibble on, and fruit-scented bubble-bath. And I like reading biographies for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds delightful. I enjoy packing a small hamper and flying by broomstick to somewhere secluded for a relaxing picnic. But that\u2019s not quite the level of <em>intimate</em> anecdote I had in mind,\u201d he purred. \u201cSomething <em>sexual</em>, Hermione. The kind of detail only a lover would know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, well uh\u2026\u201d she stammered. \u201cI enjoy a man going down on me, and Ron never did that very often. And I can get very noisy.\u201d Her voice was the quietest whisper imaginable, making Draco lean in very close indeed to catch her answer. His cologne smelled delightful, like spices and musk, and his face so close to hers made her heart flutter. Purely a meaningless physiological reaction, she assured herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will remember that,\u201d he said with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she insisted with a blush. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair if I hear something about you in return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoy having a woman on her knees in front of me, clutching at my hips while her head bobs back and forth. I would wind my hands in your hair and make a dreadful mess of it while you sucked on my hard cock until I came in your mouth,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco!\u201d Hermione glanced around paranoidly, hoping desperately no-one was listening in, but no-one was close enough to possible overhear them.</p>\n<p>He laughed wickedly at her embarrassed reaction. He looked like he was going to tease her some more, but somewhat to her relief Pansy waved him over imperiously for a private chat, and Hermione escaped to the buffet to drink her wine and nibble on a tempting looking canap\u00e9 of a parcel of something unidentifiable wrapped in bacon. And she tried to calm her racing heartbeat while images of what they\u2019d whispered about danced through her mind.</p>\n<p>Draco took a while to return, and in the meantime she accepted a dance from Ernie Macmillan, whom she remembered from the DA. He looked like he\u2019d gained a little weight since graduation, but his tailored dark purple robes flattered him well. He chatted as they danced, wanting to know about whether Draco\u2019s family was supportive of their relationship.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must keep in mind,\u201d he warned kindly, \u201cthat while a dalliance might be tolerated by a pure-blood family, marriage is another matter. It\u2019s not Draco you have to win over, it\u2019s his parents. My mother says all the right things and is proud I fought against You-Know-Who, but she still looks forward to the day I bring home a nice pure-blood witch to meet the family. I\u2019m a ninth generation pure-blood you know \u2013 that doesn\u2019t happen by accident. There\u2019s a lot of family pressure. And you know Malfoy\u2019s family is worse than mine!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s alright Ernie. It\u2019s early days still and we\u2019re not talking about marriage yet. But did you know I\u2019ve met his parents already? His father is actually <em>delighted</em> we\u2019re dating, can you believe it? As a war hero I\u2019m quite a good catch, reputation wise. His mother approves too, though she\u2019s a bit more\u2026 wary about it all. I think maybe she\u2019s worried about me hurting her son. I honestly thought it would be the other way around \u2013 that Lucius would despise me for potentially sullying the pure Malfoy line.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never have picked that either,\u201d said Ernie with a surprised blink. \u201cYou know it could really help heal the divisions in society \u2013 if you and Malfoy marry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo soon, Ernie!\u201d she laughed. \u201cHush you, we\u2019re just dating. It\u2019s going marvellously, mind you! I\u2019m much happier with Draco than I ever was with Ron.\u201d As the dance ended, they wandered together to the buffet and chose a selection of canap\u00e9s each to snack on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you two seemed really happy together,\u201d Ernie said wistfully, around a mouthful of quiche. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you broke up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you read the paper? About how he drugged me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, the love potion?\u201d he asked, not sounding especially concerned. \u201cYes, I read how upset you were about it. Usually people stay together after the potion wears off. Most people think it\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeing dosed every day for years is <em>romantic</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it that often?! Gosh, that\u2019s a bit much isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes it was</em>,\u201d she said in a very chilly tone of voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really should be more careful with your drinks, you know. It\u2019s just common sense. And there are signs you can spot in yourself if you\u2019re being affected \u2013 witches should really know those.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Hermione saw Draco returning to the dancefloor, she murmured her excuses to Ernie with relief and hurried over to him with a genuine smile. He stole a piece of smoked salmon on a tiny oval of toast from her plate and listened patiently as she vented her frustrations about Ernie\u2019s lack of understanding of how horrible being drugged was.</p>\n<p>\u201cRomantic! Can you believe that!\u201d she fumed. \u201cAnd he blamed me for not noticing I\u2019d been drugged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell he <em>was</em> a Hufflepuff. You have to make allowances for him being a bit dim.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorted with laughter. \u201cNot all Hufflepuffs were duffers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough of them. All the intelligent students went to Ravenclaw and Slytherin. With the occasional very lost Gryffindor,\u201d he said, with an amused quirk of an eyebrow at her and a sly grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kept you so long, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was helping Mr. Parkinson throw out Weasel. He tried to gatecrash Pansy\u2019s party.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did what?! He was supposed to see us together,\u201d complained Hermione bitterly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you and Pansy just let him in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked at her. \u201cBecause I did something much better. When he cast doubt on the sincerity of our relationship I insulted him, and told him to leave. I said that we wanted our relationship respected and kept private, and I threatened to make him pay if he ever tried to bother you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s mouth gaped open as she stared at him totally bewildered for a moment. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the plan, and he\u2019d never\u2026 Oh! Draco, that\u2019s brilliant! You\u2019re a genius!\u201d She broke into peals of delighted laughter as she realised his plan \u2013 Ron would <em>never</em> do what Draco told him to do. It was a hundred times better than her plan to simply let him glimpse them kissing, especially since he was still doubting their relationship was real.</p>\n<p>Draco puffed up proudly under her praise, looking delighted with her reaction. \u201cI rather thought you\u2019d like it,\u201d he said smugly. \u201cHe puffed up like an angry red toad, vowing to make me suffer for stealing his woman, before stalking off impotently with Mr. Parkinson yelling after him that he had no class, and to never darken the door of his manor again. It was wonderful \u2013 I <em>am</em> sorry you missed it, but they didn\u2019t tell me what was going on until we were halfway to Weasley.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighed happily at that delightful vision of frustration. \u201cNext time I <em>have</em> to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, the next song is about to start.\u201d He held her close as they waltzed, and he kissed her gently at the end of the dance, his mouth tasting faintly bitter like the wine he\u2019d been sipping. She kissed him back, even though Weasley was of course nowhere in sight. Of course, he might return at any moment, you never knew. And there <em>were</em> others watching. She tugged on his hand to draw him out to a balcony, and he went away with her willingly, waving cheerily (and perhaps slightly tipsily) to Pansy when she smiled and wiggled her fingers at him in a tiny girlish wave as they passed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Pansy likes you,\u201d he said, wonderingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d snorted Hermione. \u201cShe likes <em>you</em>. She\u2019s tolerated me this evening, at best. So long as I look like I\u2019m making you happy, she\u2019ll put up with me. The instant you start complaining about me to her she\u2019ll be more than happy to join in the mud-slinging.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d he admitted. \u201cStill, I\u2019ve seen her be catty for no good reason in the past. She\u2019s actually trying this time, so that\u2019s something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked around the balcony \u2013 it was deserted. The cheery lights and warmth inside the manor were a sharp contrast to the quiet of the cool night and the slight chill of the bare granite balustrade. The fir trees and manicured lawns with their sparkling white quartz paths meandering through the grounds did look beautiful in the shadowy dappled moonlight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we doing out here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just thought it would be nice out here in the moonlight,\u201d said Hermione, who was quietly hoping Ron \u2013 no, <em>Weasley</em> \u2013 might be roaming the grounds trying to get back in to the party, like an unwanted Romeo. \u201cWe could kiss? If you wanted to. People should see us making out, but I\u2019d rather they weren\u2019t close enough to eavesdrop on our conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever let it be said that I disappointed a lady,\u201d he murmured, tucking a strand of her hair behind her ear that had escaped the chignon knot that had seemed so secure earlier that evening. The charms must be fading. He gave her such a soft look, before a wicked smile snuck onto his face, as his gaze roamed all the way down her body and back up again. His gaze lingered at her chest where her cleavage was given a boost by the lightly corseted green gown, and her small emerald pendant necklace dangled enticingly between her breasts. \u201cBut <em>where</em> shall I kiss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot <em>there</em>. Eyes up here, buddy,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYour mouth, on mine. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBossy. Well, your delectable lips are a fine place to <em>start</em>,\u201d he conceded.</p>\n<p>She laughed a little, to try and hide the fact that his words made her breath catch and her heart beat faster.</p>\n<p>For all his suggestive words, when he started kissing her he didn\u2019t seem inclined to try and kiss his way down her neck to her breasts like she thought he might. His kisses were soft, and he didn\u2019t seem to slobber like Ron did. His hands weren\u2019t as well behaved as his lips were, however, and she when she felt his hands drift down from her waist to rest atop her buttocks she had to whisper a reminder that there <em>were</em> limits to the charade. His hands obediently returned to her waist.</p>\n<p>Pansy cooed a happy farewell to them when they took their leave, but Daphne glared fiercely at them from across the room. Not everyone was thrilled to see them together. It gave Hermione a pang of worry for Astoria, but Draco reassured her that Astoria knew the truth. \u201cShe understands. She just doesn\u2019t want to see us together \u2013 it\u2019s why she stayed home tonight. But Daphne \u2013 she\u2019s not a good liar, Slytherin though she was. She\u2019s ambitious, more than cunning. So she wasn\u2019t told. Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll get over it easily enough once we\u2019ve broken up and I\u2019ve proposed to her sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m sure she will,\u201d Hermione agreed. But the thought didn\u2019t reassure her as much as she\u2019d expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I <em>have</em> to go out and mingle with Muggles?\u201d whined Draco, a few days before their planned date, chatting through her Floo to iron out the last few details of where to meet and what to wear. His disembodied head in the greenish flames looked like it was pouting. \u201cWe could just leave together and give the <em>impression</em> we went out on a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already bought the tickets weeks ago!\u201d said Hermione, aghast. \u201cGrand Tier seats at <em>The Royal Opera House</em>, at 190 pounds each! You can\u2019t skip out on me and leave me there on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed. \u201cHow much is that in Galleons?\u201d</p>\n<p>She did some quick mental maths. \u201cAbout 76 Galleons total for the two tickets. That\u2019s just the opera itself and doesn\u2019t include the taxi there and back or dinner at the Crush Room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked surprised. \u201cMerlin\u2019s beard! And what kind of concert is worth that much money? The Weird Sisters are only 6 Galleons a show! Can you afford that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money \u2013 my parents gave me the money for it. The goblins\u2019 exchange rate is outrageous, and my Ministry job doesn\u2019t pay as well as I\u2019d assumed it would. And of course it costs a bit, it\u2019s an opera. <em>Carmen</em>, composed by Bizet. It\u2019s in French, which I understand you speak. I\u2019ve picked up a little from holidays in France, but not enough to follow it, so I\u2019ll probably just read the surtitles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an opera, exactly? Will there be dancing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously? You don\u2019t know what an opera is?\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowned at her.</p>\n<p>Pure-bloods. They lived in a weird cultural ghetto. \u201cOkay. Well, it\u2019s like a play you just sit and watch and listen to, but it has lots of singing. Really <em>good</em> singing. And instrumental accompaniment \u2013 lots of violins and other stringed instruments, as well as woodwind and brass sections. It\u2019s regarded as a very classy form of entertainment suitable for rich people and musical snobs, if a little old-fashioned. You\u2019ll love it, I promise. I picked something that wouldn\u2019t be \u2018too Muggle\u2019 and won\u2019t shock your sensibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDress code?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFormal. A Muggle suit, of some kind. Black tie would be fine.\u201d She thought for a moment about the kinds of things wizards wore when they were trying to mingle with Muggles. \u201cA black suit with a white shirt would be best. Nothing gaudy or colourful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em> what black tie means,\u201d he said frostily. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find my sense of fashion is superior to yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>She arched an eyebrow at him. \u201cWell <em>forgive </em>me, your highness. You <em>have</em> seen some of the things pure-bloods think are Muggle attire, haven\u2019t you? Women\u2019s nightdresses, and plaid trousers with a green straw sun hat?\u201d</p>\n<p>He paused for a moment, then nodded. \u201cPoint to you. I\u2019m quite confident I know what\u2019s appropriate, but I\u2019ll owl you a photo of my planned outfit for double checking. Is that agreeable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked broody and reflective. \u201cThat's a lot of Galleons for one night out. I didn\u2019t know your family was wealthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not anywhere as much as yours \u2013 your manor is gorgeous, and the grounds are amazing. But my parents are quite well off by Muggle standards. They\u2019re both dentists \u2013 Healers who specialise in fixing problems with teeth. It\u2019s a reasonably lucrative career choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo we really <em>have</em> to go out amongst Muggles?\u201d he pleaded again. \u201cCould you get a refund of some kind? My father\u2019s really not going to like it. I can think of some other lovely date ideas. I\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed at him. \u201cI\u2019ve already briefed your parents about it, so they can say the right things if asked. Your father was <em>thrilled</em> by the plan. He said something along the lines of, \u2018Better him than me. Let Draco hobnob with the Muggles. It will do our image good.\u2019 So you see, there\u2019s no hope for you. You\u2019re doomed to endure an opera with me. But trust me, it won\u2019t be the ordeal you\u2019re fearing right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn you, father,\u201d muttered Draco rebelliously to himself. Hermione ignored him. He didn\u2019t have to like it \u2013 he just had to agree to it and put on a passable act, and she was confident he\u2019d manage that much.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>In the sumptuous darkened theatre Hermione smirked at Draco as he sat next to her, his gaze enraptured. He\u2019d complained about the clothes (the black bowtie was <em>dull</em> and felt all wrong), the taxi and the frightening traffic (too unpredictable, and too noisy), and the intimidating press of so very <em>many</em> people. But once the music started, he\u2019d shut up and hadn\u2019t said a word except to hiss at her to be quiet when she\u2019d asked him if he\u2019d changed his mind about not liking her plan to come to the opera.</p>\n<p>When the lights brightened for intermission he was livid. \u201cThat\u2019s not a proper ending!\u201d he complained loudly. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of the story! They didn\u2019t finish it! I was enjoying that and they just left it in the middle! What\u2019s going to happen with Don Jos\u00e9 and the smugglers? And what about Mica\u00ebla? And does Don Jos\u00e9 stay with Carmen or not? Are they ever going to get married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just intermission,\u201d she soothed. \u201cThere\u2019s a twenty minute break to get drinks and go to the bathroom. Then there will be another hour of opera.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe opera?\u201d she teased with a straight face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe intermission!\u201d he said indignantly, then laughed when he saw the grin on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose Muggles have <em>some</em> cultural accomplishments,\u201d he conceded.</p>\n<p>Their break was very short. He didn\u2019t trust the promise of a warning bell, and wanted to be sure of being back in their seats in time.</p>\n<p>At the end of the evening, they went to the Crush Room for a late dinner, and he grandly and patronisingly approved of the d\u00e9cor. Chandeliers, old oil paintings, and linen-covered tables were a very reassuringly familiar atmosphere for him, even if the patrons weren\u2019t dressed in the robes he was more accustomed to.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is quite nice,\u201d he said, looking relieved. \u201cMore sumptuous than I\u2019d dreamed. I\u2019d heard Muggles sat in crowded little rooms to eat, with no-one waiting tables so you had to fetch your food yourself. Eating with flimsy cutlery that broke if you tried to use it, if they even gave you cutlery <em>at all</em> \u2013 I heard many Muggles ate with their hands. I suppose people were just making it up to mock me. Making fun of the ignorant pure-blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. What you said is actually the case in cheaper restaurants,\u201d she conceded. \u201cFast-food restaurants, they\u2019re called. You collect your meal of food like burgers and chips from the counter yourself, and eat them with your hands. But the nicer restaurants are a more traditional dining experience. Typically fancier than Hogwarts, in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p>She ordered the smoked duck breast with pomegranate dressing, while he pondered the many options and eventually selected the poached lobster salad. He approved of the variety of delectable French desserts on offer, and they both decided they wanted the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.</p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoyed this evening immensely,\u201d he said after the last bite of dessert was finished, reaching across the table to hold her hand. \u201cThank you for pushing me to come here, even though I was nervous. I would have missed out on such a wonderful experience, without ever knowing what I\u2019d lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cNo complaints then? Apart from the taxi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d he said hesitantly, \u201cit worried me that Carmen died at the end of the opera. That was a rather barbaric end to the tale. But I can appreciate the drama of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s dreadfully sad,\u201d she agreed. \u201cA lot of operas are tragedies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggles don\u2019t do that often, do they?\u201d he asked in a quiet worried voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t worry Ron will attack you out of jealous rage, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She felt touched, and shyly embarrassed that he\u2019d thought to worry about her feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t really worry\u2026 that is\u2026 I worry sometimes he may try and drug me again. With another love potion. But Harry promised to give me another antidote if I ever went back to Ron for any reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe opera is just a story \u2013 not real events. And one set over a century ago, at that. But while people don\u2019t use swords any more, things a little like that do happen on rare occasions in the Muggle world \u2013 a man killing his partner if she dares to leave him. \u2018If I can\u2019t have you, no-one will!\u2019 It\u2019s the horrible end to years of domestic violence, in some cases. I\u2019d wager something similar happens in the wizarding world on occasion too, albeit probably more likely to involve curses or poisons than knives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter\u2019s a good friend to you,\u201d mused Draco thoughtfully. \u201cAnd thank you for being honest this evening instead of only telling me <em>nice</em> things about the Muggle world.\u201d</p>\n<p>They took a taxi back to the <em>Leaky Cauldron</em>, where they got Tom to take a photo of them in all their Muggle finery, and kissed farewell in front of the few relatively disinterested patrons there before going their separate ways home via the Floo.</p>\n<p>The next day the society column of the <em>Daily Prophet</em> included their photo along with some quotes from Draco raving about the delights of Muggle opera, the high quality of the finer restaurants, and how he was looking into buying season tickets. He gave all the credit for the idea of going to the opera to his \u201cdarling Hermione\u201d, and gushed about how she made him happier with every day of their life together.</p>\n<p>She knew the last bit was a complete fabrication. But it was nice to hear him saying such pleasant things about her. He was keeping up his end of their agreement more than adequately.</p>\n<p>She especially loved Rita\u2019s little jibe she worked into the article about how it was clear <em>some</em> men of higher calibre knew the way to a woman\u2019s heart was through charm and appreciation, not a bottle of potion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Draco said, waving the gilt edged card at her disbelievingly. He\u2019d shown up at her office at the Ministry at the end of the day with a gift of flowers to disguise the real object of his visit (a puzzled complaint) from her co-workers.</p>\n<p>\u201cA wedding invitation, obviously. You\u2019re my plus one. I\u2019m not in the bridal party anymore \u2013 I couldn\u2019t stomach standing up in support of their sham of a marriage. But I\u2019m still going as a guest, and I\u2019d like you to go too. It\u2019s step six in my plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter and the youngest Weasley spawn? Must I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well. I suppose it <em>is </em>the \u2018event of the season\u2019. Any objections to intimidating the hoi polloi with a conspicuous show of wealth in formal robes?\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounded fine to her. \u201cNot at all. Go for it. I\u2019ll be dressing up to make him rabidly angry about my now-unattainable beauty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked thoughtfully at her. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for new robes for you. And I\u2019ll ask mother about loaning you some of the Malfoy jewels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dresses on our dates were quite acceptable \u2013 don\u2019t misunderstand me there. You looked lovely in your robes, even if the shoes weren\u2019t quite a match. But if you want to intimidate, impress, and make a show of how happy we are together in front of your ex, custom-made flattering expensive robes will do that much better than a robe or dress everyone has already seen you wear to another event. The Malfoy family jewels will be the icing on the cake. Weasel probably won\u2019t recognise them, but others will \u2013 and will no doubt gossip about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is payback for me making you wear a Muggle suit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a delightful bonus,\u201d he smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the cost \u2013 just get the best available. It\u2019s my treat in thanks for our delightful date at the opera. I\u2019ll set up an appointment with <em>Twilfitt and Tattings</em>. Mother might go with you \u2013 I\u2019ll sound her out on it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJoy,\u201d she said in a voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe nice. She doesn\u2019t have much to fill her days with since the war. Some families snub her because she supported the Dark Lord, others snub her because she turned on him. If she\u2019s willing to make a rare trip out of the house to help you pick out a robe, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d show a little bit of bloody courtesy about it, for Merlin\u2019s sake,\u201d he said with increasing snippiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it for her sake,\u201d she promised. She\u2019d just assumed Narcissa wouldn\u2019t want to slum it out in public with a Mudblood. She\u2019d never thought much before about the families of those who\u2019d been on the other side of the war, or cared about their social lives. Life had been easier when things were more black and white.</p>\n<p>She shooed him out after their discussion that so she could wrap up a few last bits of work before finishing for the day. With the <em>Werewolf Fair Employment Act</em> passed, with several pure-blood members of the Wizengamot unexpectedly supporting it much to her delight, it was time to move onto other important projects such as securing more unpolluted waterways for mermaid habitation, and laws to protect their lives and territories.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Later that evening at home Hermione realised something she\u2019d missed in the conversation. She\u2019d accidentally called Harry\u2019s wedding to Ginny a \u201csham\u201d, and Draco hadn\u2019t blinked an eye at her turn of phrase. She knew she should leave it alone, but it nagged at her like a sore tooth. He couldn\u2019t have missed it. She\u2019d also been talking about not being in the bridal party, and he didn\u2019t even question that. He was too smart to miss it, and surely too curious to just leave such a thing alone. Eventually she gave into the pressure of thoughts whirling around in her head, and popped through the Floo to visit him, ostensibly to join the Malfoys for dinner and to discuss shopping plans with Narcissa. After the social niceties of greeting were done, she covertly asked Draco if they could go somewhere private to talk before dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well. It seems an auspicious day for me today!\u201d he said with a grin, and led her to his room. \u201cWe can\u2019t be long of course, or mother will worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>His bedroom was very luxurious, with a carved four poster bed hung with heavy green velvet curtains, a brass-bound wooden chest with a curved top looking like a pirate treasure chest at the foot of his bed, two dark stained oak bookcases crammed full of leather-bound books, and a selection of dragon figures in various metals and ceramics adorning the tops of the shelves. Animated tapestries made the plain white walls more interesting, with embroidered dragons swooping through clouded skies, and gliding over stormy seas. A portrait landscape of a magical wood had tiny fairies flitting to and fro, and shy unicorns peeking out from behind trees. Draco closed the door behind them as they entered.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I was wondering\u2026\u201d Hermione started nervously, biting her lip. She glanced at him then away, embarrassed and not knowing where to start.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. I have been too,\u201d murmured Draco, and stepped forward to slide his arms smoothly around her waist, pulling her into his lean body and kissing her softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she gasped, pulling her lips away from his.</p>\n<p>He tilted his head quizzically at her. \u201cKissing you, obviously,\u201d he said, and leaned in again to kiss her again, afterwards delicately trailing kisses on her sensitive neck. His lips mouthed at her skin, with just a hint of teeth \u2013 not enough to hurt or leave a mark \u2013 and it sent shivers down her spine. Her breath came faster and she let out an involuntary moan as his hands cupped her buttocks while his mouth nibbled at her neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no-one to see us, this is just pretend, remember?\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually in a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled his head away from the patterns he was tracing on her neck with his tongue, and his grey eyes gazed seriously into her own from inches away. It would have felt intimate even <em>without</em> his hands kneading her buttocks while they spoke, or the evidence of his arousal pressing firmly against her lower belly. \u201cOh, yes of course,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut just because it won\u2019t last doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a bit of fun, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>She bit her lip as she thought about it. Soft strands of Draco\u2019s pale blonde hair brushed against her face as he leant in to kiss and nibble at her ear while she thought. The soft press of his wet tongue pushing inside her ear brought a shiver to her body that was decidedly <em>not</em> helping her concentrate. She <em>was</em> attracted to him. And why not? Didn\u2019t she deserve a little fun? He might be a bit of an arrogant prat whose family would disown her if she was <em>really</em> out to catch him for marriage. But he was a very <em>handsome</em> prat. Surely it wouldn\u2019t do any harm if their play-acting had a bit of added realism.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust so long as we both remember it\u2019s going to end soon,\u201d she warned breathlessly. \u201cThat this doesn\u2019t mean anything. Lust isn\u2019t the same thing as love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he agreed with an amicable smile, drawing back to look into her eyes again. \u201cWe both know that it can\u2019t go anywhere. And I won\u2019t risk getting you pregnant and sully both our reputations in the process. But there are still many other things we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust not\u2026 actual sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstoria\u2019s rule. And mine. You understand, I hope?\u201d</p>\n<p>She took a step back from him and reached behind her to peel his hands off her bottom, making him sigh with disappointment. But when Hermione lifted them up and placed them on her breasts with a coy smile, he let out a deep groan of appreciation and started squeezing them gently. She sighed happily with little breathy moans as he started tweaking at her nipples through the rough silk fabric of her robe. She closed her eyes, lost in the sensations washing through her body. It had been too long. Her nipples stiffened under the attention into hard peaks, and she arched her back needily, pressing her breasts into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have beautiful breasts,\u201d Draco purred, and she opened her eyes to see him watching her intently. It made her suddenly more shy. Should she really be doing this? With someone she once hated? But he wasn\u2019t a child any longer, parroting his father\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d Draco chided. \u201cAnd no biting your lip. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leant in close, one hand moving to cup the back of her head gently as he kissed her. The first few kisses were soft, and gentle. Then they became hungrier, more demanding. His tongue pressed inside her mouth, and she let him inside, kissing him back with increasing passion. He nipped gently at her bottom lip with his teeth, which made her laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou vampire!\u201d she teased. \u201cNo doubt it will be my neck next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you have such a tasty and responsive neck,\u201d he teased, \u201cso how can I resist?\u201d With a sudden wicked growl he buried his face in her neck, nipping gently and sucking at the skin. It made her heart skip a beat, and made her gasp with the sudden shock of pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh\u2026 yes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut don\u2019t leave a mark.\u201d She tilted her head back to give him better access. Her hands, resting around his waist, crept slowly down his body to brush over his buttocks, evoking an indecipherable noise of pleasure from Draco. She tugged at his white linen shirt where it was tucked snugly into his pants, pulling it free, and her hands dove eagerly underneath the cloth to glide up the bare skin of his back.</p>\n<p>Draco clearly decided that turnaround was fair play, and tried to tug the font of her robe down to expose her breasts without success, as it fitted quite snugly around the top half of her body, then flared out. He cursed impatiently and his hands roved over her back for a while before he gave up and stepped back with his hands on his hips to indirectly ask for help.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are the <em>laces</em>? This is ridiculous. How do you even get into this? A Cutting Charm and a Reparo?\u201d he huffed. \u201cI know the new fashion for witches is for tight robes and they\u2019re delightful to look at. But there must be <em>some</em> consideration for practicality!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s a zip. Madam Malkin\u2019s been experimenting with some Muggle tailoring techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turned her back to him, and reaching behind her pulled the zip slowly down while he watched curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. I still don\u2019t understand how it works. But I\u2019m impressed. You can reverse it, surely?\u201d</p>\n<p>The mood was still intimate, but the romantic mood was rather lost while he played curiously with the zipper on the back of her robe, tugging it up and down and peering at how the teeth fitted together, and she got a little nervous again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 it\u2019s a bit fast,\u201d she said uncertainly, when he encouraged her to shimmy out of her robe.</p>\n<p>He hesitated a moment before saying, \u201cThen we\u2019ll go slower.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her as he zipped her robe back up, and she smiled with relief in his embrace.</p>\n<p>They returned to making out with more gentleness than passion this time. Kissing in a leisurely and exploratory fashion, hands roaming cautiously over each other. He learnt that she loved her neck and ears being paid attention, but didn\u2019t like him biting her lip. Her hands roamed under his shirt and found the skin on his back soft and smooth under her fingertips, and she discovered that he was ticklish around his ribs, eliciting some surprisingly deep chuckles.</p>\n<p>Hermione had just tentatively stroked a hand across the front of his pants while he kneaded her covered breasts when the chiming sound of a bell rang through the room, and Draco cursed quietly as he pulled away from her, leaving her panting as she swayed towards him. \u201cThe dinner bell. We have to go, or mother will come looking for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Curse that bell.</p>\n<p>Hermione straightened up her dress, and smoothed down her hair as best she could, but it was a lost cause. At least messy hair would look quite normal on her. She had permanent bed hair, unless liberal amounts of hair products or charms were applied. It started out neat at the beginning of her work day, but by the evening the charms had long since worn off, and she never bothered to reapply them once she was home.</p>\n<p>Draco had turned away from her to tuck his shirt back in, and was clearly trying to get his rebellious body under control before venturing out of his room.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm\u2026 I actually\u2026 I had a question about Ginny?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What about her?\u201d he said, sounding very surprised by her question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem surprised that I\u2019ve had a falling out with her, and won\u2019t be in the wedding party?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cTen points to Gryffindor for the choice of conversational topic, by the way. Thinking of the Weaselette is certainly helping my erection go down very quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione let out a surprised laugh.</p>\n<p>Still facing away from her, Draco said confidently, \u201cObviously she\u2019s used a love potion on Potter at some stage. Am I right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 really couldn\u2019t say,\u201d she hedged. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say. It\u2019s patently obvious from the hatred in your voice when you talk about her. You haven\u2019t had any obvious falling out \u2013 the papers would be all over that. The timing is the same as you leaving the Weasel. It could just be her being angry with you about that, but I think there\u2019s too much venom for it to be her simply fighting with you about slandering her brother. It\u2019s something more personal. So it must be her dosing Potter, and your prevarication just now proves I\u2019m right.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019d promised Harry she wouldn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWe just had a fight. Over bridesmaid dresses. It got nasty. That\u2019s all it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned around at last, and the scepticism on his face was obvious. \u201cMmm hmm. You\u2019ll have to practice your lines more if you want to fool people more observant than your average Hufflepuff, you know. Well, let\u2019s shelve that topic for now. Shall I escort you down to dinner?\u201d He tucked a stray lock of her hair behind her ear, and offered his arm.</p>\n<p>She placed her hand in the crook of his arm, and was escorted down to enjoy a quiet family dinner with the Malfoys.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>The staff at <em>Twilfitt and Tattings</em> were overjoyed to have Hermione patronise their store during her lunchtime break from work, but looked down their nose at Narcissa, who kept a stiff upper lip about it all, but was clearly not enjoying herself.</p>\n<p>While Hermione was in a changing room behind a thick velvet curtain, trying on a stunning and expensive Acromantula silk robe edged with silver embroidery and dripping with crystal beads, she overheard the staff\u2019s sneering quiet comments to Narcissa. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have anything to suit <em>you</em>,\u201d said one clerk, a woman in her twenties with carefully curled hair and too much make-up. \u201cWe don\u2019t cater much to the elderly here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, now, Estrella,\u201d tutted the older lady who worked there and seemed to be in charge, \u201cher money is as good as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Narcissa, so softly that Hermione barely heard it, as she stood frozen in the changing room, eavesdropping intently.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d continued the older lady with quiet viciousness, \u201cYou-Know-Who certainly appreciated the depths of the Malfoy coffers, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-She doesn\u2019t need you, or your nasty Death Eater son,\u201d interrupted the older woman.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a luncheon to get to elsewhere?\u201d said Estrella.</p>\n<p>Hermione swept back the curtain with a clatter of wooden curtain rings, and the two women jumped back guiltily away from Narcissa, whom they\u2019d been standing over. Hermione saw the younger one slip her wand back into her pocket. Narcissa was just sitting there quietly in an armchair, head hung slightly low and a stiff carefully expressionless look on her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there some problem here?\u201d Hermione asked coolly. \u201cDo you have an issue with someone patronising your store who\u2019s a hero of the war? Are you angry at your Dark Lord\u2019s fall? We\u2019d be more than happy to take our business elsewhere if that\u2019s the case. I can get my robe for <em>Harry Potter\u2019s wedding</em> at some <em>other</em> store.\u201d</p>\n<p>The older lady hurried towards her with an anxious fluttering of her manicured hands. \u201cOh no! No, Miss Granger. We\u2019re immensely grateful for what you did in the war. You helped save us all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t think we sided with <em>him</em>,\u201d pleaded the younger one. \u201cWe\u2019re ever so grateful to you, honestly. My brother was arrested during the war \u2013 they snapped his wand but at least they let him go after that. I don\u2019t know what might have happened if You-Know-Who had actually won.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t speaking of myself,\u201d she said, still with a frosty tone of voice. \u201cI was speaking of my beloved\u2019s mother, Mrs. Narcissa Malfoy. She too is a hero of the war. The betrayer of Lord Voldemort \u2013 no don\u2019t flinch \u2013 and saviour of Harry Potter. Without her, Harry would be dead, and the wizarding world still under Lord Voldemort\u2019s rule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa raised her head wonderingly at Hermione\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>The two ladies gaped a little before recovering. \u201c<em>She</em> didn\u2019t really do much,\u201d said Estrella hesitantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you did? Lied to the Dark Lord\u2019s face, did you? Risked your life to save your brother, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026No. We just\u2026 hid.\u201d The younger woman looked ashamed, and like she might burst into tears at any moment.</p>\n<p>Hermione strode over to her and held her hands, looking her in the eyes. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no shame in that. That\u2019s what most people did, if they had any sense. They hid. They left the country. That was smart, and I don\u2019t blame you for it. Just remember, some people didn\u2019t have the chance. Like the Malfoys, with Lord Voldemort hovering over the lot of them, ready to kill one family member at any moment if another didn\u2019t do exactly what he said.\u201d</p>\n<p>The young woman sniffed unhappily. \u201cThank you, that means a lot, coming from you. I knew I should have done more, but I was so scared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how can you date a Malfoy?\u201d the older woman asked, disbelievingly. \u201cNo matter what their actions were at the <em>end</em> of the war, you can\u2019t deny the whole family is Dark. And that boy Draco took the Dark Mark too. Willingly. He\u2019s a Death Eater \u2013 how can you stand to touch him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not perfect. Perhaps no-one is. He became a better person \u2013 would you want to be judged your whole life on what you were like at sixteen? He regretted it quickly \u2013 he took it more to save his family than out of belief in the cause. Did you know that when Harry, Ron, and I were caught and taken to Malfoy Manor, he lied for us? He was asked to identify us and he said he wasn\u2019t sure, it might not be us. Claimed not to recognise <em>Harry Potter</em>. He and Narcissa stalled, even with her mad sister standing right there ready to torture us and hand us over to Voldemort. Six years together at Hogwarts and you think he didn\u2019t know who we were? He did what little he could. It wasn\u2019t much, but he tried. And he treats me with more respect and consideration than that rapist <em>Weasley</em> ever did, who drugged me to the eyeballs with love potions until I could refuse him nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman looked embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know about what the Malfoys did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps more people <em>should</em> know. And it\u2019s not me you need to apologise to.\u201d</p>\n<p>At a signalling nod from the elder, the two ladies curtseyed to Narcissa. \u201cI do apologise, Mrs. Malfoy. I beg your forgiveness for our rudeness and the misunderstanding, and I hope you know that you are in fact always welcome at <em>Twilfitt and Tattings.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A slow smile dawned on her face. \u201cThank you, I appreciate that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stayed, and Hermione was eventually coaxed into ordering a horrifyingly expensive concoction of the finest Acromantula pale yellow silk, embroidered with seed pearls and real gold thread. From the quietly pleased expression on Narcissa\u2019s face, the price (while high) was perhaps not unreasonable, however.</p>\n<p>Hermione quietly slipped the staff an extra ten Galleons as a tip. \u201cI would not be averse to the <em>Daily Prophet </em>or <em>Witch Weekly</em> hearing about what we discussed today. If you are inclined to make it better known what the Malfoys did during the war to the Light\u2019s benefit, and my forgiveness of their less palatable actions, I would appreciate that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly, Miss Granger. And again, my most heartfelt apologies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa evidently wasn\u2019t the type to gush in public. But she gave Hermione a farewell hug to go along with her quiet whispered thanks, before she Apparated home.</p>\n<p>Clearly she was more forthcoming in the bosom of her own family, however. There was a delivery of a massive bunch of rare orchids that Hermione found waiting at her door when she returned home that evening after work, with a gilt-edged card from Draco that read, \u201cThank you so much. Mother is smiling again and won\u2019t stop talking about what you did. With my love and gratitude always, Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Susan Bones knocked on Hermione\u2019s office door in the Ministry.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione? Are you ready to go get lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust finishing up now!\u201d she called out, scribbling a last note and sending it flying off through the Ministry with a quick charm.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood work on the <em>Werewolf Fair Employment Act</em>,\u201d Susan said, as Hermione grabbed her bag and came out into the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you! I\u2019m so pleased it got through at last.\u201d</p>\n<p>Susan laughed. \u201cAt last? It took under a year! That\u2019s amazing \u2013 everyone says so. And your house-elf regulations only the year before that. And I hear you\u2019re working on some projects to do with mermaids now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s so exciting! I\u2019ve already gotten the Black Lake officially recognised as protected habitat, and secured agreement to have water filtration charms installed on all the sewage outlets from Hogwarts!\u201d she chattered excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s marvellous! You know, word is that the Minister is keeping a close eye on your work lately, and is <em>very</em> impressed,\u201d Susan said, as they entered the cafeteria.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Kingsley is a softie for any of us lot from the war,\u201d she said humbly. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything special. And how\u2019s your work in the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, thanks. Busy time! Lots of young kids manifesting some accidental magic this month. It\u2019s especially tricky when it\u2019s a Muggle-born, of course. I\u2019ve had to call in the Obliviators a couple of times. I really think early intervention with formal contact from the Ministry would be better, in some of these cases.\u201d</p>\n<p>The two of them each grabbed a plate of sandwiches, a piece of fruit, and some biscuits from the Ministry cafeteria, and sat down at one of the whitewashed wooden tables to share lunch and chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear the news about your ex?\u201d Susan asked, leaning in close to whisper confidentially. \u201cRon\u2019s been fired from the Auror Program, even though he was so close to finishing his Apprenticeship and being a full Auror. Officially it\u2019s because he\u2019d rather go and work in his brother\u2019s joke shop. But a little owl told me that it\u2019s because of \u2018conduct unbecoming an Auror\u2019, and that he was strongly encouraged to leave with his dignity intact rather than be fired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSusan, I think I\u2019m in love!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, with you!\u201d said Hermione with a laugh. \u201cMy goodness, this is the best news I\u2019ve heard in a long while. Oh, thank you so much, you wonderful Queen of Gossip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Susan giggled happily. \u201cWell thank you, my darling. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to spurn your affections, as I have a date on Saturday with Carl Hopkins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Do tell me all the juicy details!\u201d Hermione said eagerly. \u201cAnd is he any relation to Wayne Hopkins?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis cousin. Carl was a year ahead of us at Hogwarts. He\u2019s working with the Unspeakables. And he\u2019s very handsome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, good luck!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you! I haven\u2019t had a date for over a year, so fingers crossed it goes well. Any tips? You thawed the Ice Prince, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLow cut dresses?\u201d Hermione suggested with a straight face, before breaking into infectious giggles that Susan joined in with. They gossiped for a little while about their respective dates, in between bites of food. Hermione found it nice to have a female friend \u2013 they\u2019d never really bonded at Hogwarts due to being in different Houses, but the D.A. and the War had drawn them together, and when they both started working at the Ministry at the same time they found themselves sticking together a lot \u2013 two lonely, bright young women without their families around to support their ambitions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get back to work,\u201d Susan said eventually, pushing her chair back with a scrape and standing up. \u201cSee you at Ginny\u2019s hen\u2019s night this evening?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione hesitated, \u201cWell, no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to make it, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m coming down with something. I\u2019ve been quite ill this morning,\u201d she lied.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look well,\u201d Susan said doubtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know me,\u201d Hermione said guiltily, \u201cI\u2019m just soldiering through, dosed up with a lot of healing potions. I think when they wear off I\u2019m going to crash badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Susan worriedly, taking a cautious step away from her. \u201cNothing infectious, I hope?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope not. Some vomiting, a bit of fever \u2013 I\u2019ve taken a Fever-reducing Potion for that. Pepper-up for the tiredness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should take the afternoon off, just in case? You wouldn\u2019t want to make anyone else sick. And look after yourself \u2013 go to bed and rest up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Trapped in her own lie, Hermione conceded with a nod. \u201cI think you\u2019re right, I really should. I can take a bit of work home with me, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWork! No,\u201d Susan said sternly, \u201cyou should catch up on some of that reading you say you never have time for anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe afternoon in bed with no work, a book to read, and a mug of hot cocoa? Alright Susan, you\u2019ve twisted my arm and I have no choice but to comply,\u201d Hermione said with a laugh.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Harry hadn\u2019t wanted a buck\u2019s night \u2013 he\u2019d said he didn\u2019t see the point of it, and Ginny certainly didn\u2019t mind him skipping that particular tradition. So since Hermione knew he\u2019d be home alone that evening, she\u2019d invited him to Floo over and visit her for a bit of a catch up.</p>\n<p>Over a simple pasta dinner they caught up on each other\u2019s lives, and carefully pried into the other\u2019s love life with the best tactfulness a couple of Gryffindors could manage.</p>\n<p>Harry carefully ascertained that Draco was treating her right, and nagged her into taking a love potion antidote in front of him\u2026 just in case. He apologised afterwards when she still insisted she was happy with Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026 had to be sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>She patted his hand. \u201cI understand. I did <em>tell</em> you I\u2019ve been taking them occasionally already.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hung his head. \u201cI know, you said that before, but\u2026 what if they weren\u2019t real antidotes? What if he\u2019d swapped them out for fakes? I was just nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I get it. But I really <em>do</em> want to date Draco. He can be a snarky git, but he\u2019s also amusing, and charming, and gives great presents,\u201d she said, waving with a smile at the vase full of only slightly wilted orchids still on her desk. \u201cHe\u2019s serious about liking Muggle opera too, you know. You should have seen him there! It was like a revelation for him that Muggles actually aren\u2019t all uncultured barbarians.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo long as he\u2019s treating you well, and you\u2019re genuinely happy. It just seemed so fast, after leaving Ron. Are you sure he\u2019s serious? I\u2019d hate to see you hurt again.\u201d Harry looked so worried for her, it warmed her heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how serious it is. It was a rebound relationship, after all. I admit it. If it goes somewhere, great. If not, well, it\u2019s been a lot of fun while it lasted. I admit I talk it up for the paper a bit, but we really are doing well. It\u2019s fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to see you happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, I am happy. Happier than I have been in a long while, I think. He values me for who I am, not who he wants to shape me into,\u201d she said, and as she spoke she realised how true it was. \u201cRon was never like that. He liked me <em>despite</em> the kind of person I am. Draco\u2019s the opposite \u2013 he accepts me. The most he\u2019s seemed inclined to do is nag me into wearing fancier clothes, and I can live with that. You should see the dress robes I\u2019ve got for your wedding \u2013 they\u2019re gorgeous!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I hope it works out then. And I haven\u2019t seen the robes yet \u2013 keep them a surprise \u2013 but I read a description of your outfit already! Your dressmaker was in an article in <em>Witch Weekly</em> this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d Hermione said smugly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed you weren\u2019t quoted saying anything about his father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Lucius is an enormous racist prat who would\u2019ve been delighted if the Dark Lord won. But he\u2019s trying to change. It\u2019s all one can hope for, really. Rehabilitation minus the prison is working well in his case. As well as can be realistically expected, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s supporting his son dating a \u2018Mudblood\u2019! That\u2019s a big change,\u201d said Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first to remark on it,\u201d said Hermione. Her turn to quiz <em>him</em> now, she decided. \u201cHarry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed, and answered the question that she hadn\u2019t asked yet but he guessed she wanted to. \u201cI\u2019m still marrying Ginny. I want a family, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I figured that. I just wanted to know how you are feeling about it all. Are you angry with her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry propped an elbow on the table (<em>Narcissa would be appalled</em>, thought Hermione) and leant his chin in his hand. \u201cYes and no. It changes from day to day. Do you want to know who I\u2019m really angry with? My father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m furiously angry with him. How dare he trick my mother into dating him? And entrap her into marriage and <em>still</em> keep dosing her\u2026 he enslaved her. Like you were enslaved. And now here I am, a child of a potion-laced liaison. Unable to love like everyone says a man should be able to love. Everyone except Snape used to talk about my dad like he was a great hero. Meanwhile these days I sometimes feel like applauding Voldemort for killing him and setting my mother free, however briefly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Harry!\u201d she said, tears in her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t.\u201d She pushed back her chair, and walked around his side of the tiny table, pulling him into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat hurts so much is that I\u2019ll never know for sure what happened. Everyone I could ask who\u2019d know the truth is dead now \u2013 all dad\u2019s friends are gone too. What if he stopped the potion after the wedding, and she threatened to leave, but he drugged her again? I want to know, but I don\u2019t know if I could bear knowing the truth. I\u2019ve been thinking about looking for the Resurrection Stone, just so I can ask. Is that wrong, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you want to do, I\u2019ll support you, Harry,\u201d she vowed with fierce determination.</p>\n<p>And it was at that moment, while she was holding Harry in her arms and staring into his eyes, that the Floo flared a bright green as Draco Malfoy ducked through the fireplace into her flat, carrying a picnic basket.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione? How are you\u2026 doing\u2026\u201d Draco said, trailing off as he saw her embracing Harry as he sat at her table, the remains of a candlelit dinner for two in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco? What are you doing here?\u201d she said, letting Harry go.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>heard</em> you were sick,\u201d he said accusingly. \u201cConfined to bed you were so ill with fever. I brought you some soup and potions. But here you are having a<em> private dinner with Harry Potter</em>.\u201d He glared angrily at Harry, who grinned to see him so jealous.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there something I should know here, Hermione?\u201d Draco asked her bitterly. \u201cSome <em>minor</em> detail you\u2019ve neglected to tell me? Perhaps there\u2019s <em>another</em> reason you\u2019re upset that Harry is marrying Ginny? Am I really just a tool to make <em>him</em> jealous and ready to commit to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No, Draco. We\u2019re just friends, honestly!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t <em>look</em> like it, meeting him secretly like this while his fianc\u00e9e is away celebrating their upcoming nuptials,\u201d he accused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>not</em> in love with Harry,\u201d she stated firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not in love with you?\u201d Draco asked suspiciously. \u201cThere\u2019s no elopement being planned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I do love her, and she wants me to run away with her and forget all about Ginny,\u201d Harry said with a teasing smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry! You\u2019re <em>not</em> helping and it\u2019s <em>not</em> funny!\u201d she yelled, jaw gaping with disbelief.</p>\n<p>Draco scowled at the two of them.</p>\n<p>Harry relented. \u201cI care for her like a sister, Draco. That\u2019s all. We\u2019re just friends. I was just teasing you \u2013 I wanted to see if you were serious about her. It\u2019s good to see you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco eyed him warily. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to date her, marry her? You\u2019ll say that to her face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d marry her if I wasn\u2019t marrying Ginny, if she\u2019d have me. She\u2019s my best friend. It might be nice. But she deserves better than me. You\u2019re definitely the better man for her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 the better man?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded decisively. \u201cYes. You make her happy. Happier than I could. Certainly much happier than she was with Ron. Look at you, bringing her soup, sending her flowers, taking her out on dates and introducing her to your family! She blushes and smiles when she talks about you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-I don\u2019t blush!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-And I think that\u2019s fantastic. She deserves happiness. She deserves love. And I wouldn\u2019t ever stand in the way of the dawn of true love, no matter who it\u2019s with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? You don\u2019t object to us being together?\u201d Draco asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all. I congratulate you on your good sense in choosing her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes were narrowed as he strode over to Hermione and pulled her into his arms, and dipped her for a kiss. She melted into it instantly \u2013 he really was an exceptional kisser.</p>\n<p>When they straightened up she found Draco was watching Harry\u2019s reaction, not hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee? Nothing. I don\u2019t mind you\u2019re with her I swear,\u201d said Harry, with a slightly sad smile. \u201cI wish you two nothing but the best, Draco. Hermione and I are nothing but two old friends enjoying a private dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the hug?\u201d he asked, still holding Hermione tightly around the waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a friendly reassuring hug. We were discussing something upsetting. And the topic is none of your business,\u201d Harry said firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you kiss me again while watching someone else, male or female, I will <em>slap</em> you Draco Malfoy,\u201d Hermione warned. \u201cSlap if you\u2019re lucky. Punch if you\u2019re not, and you know I have a mean right hook.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said shamefacedly. \u201cI was just\u2026 concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were <em>jealous</em>. But there\u2019s nothing to be jealous of,\u201d she promised. \u201cI won\u2019t date anyone else while I\u2019m dating you, I swear. And I certainly hope you\u2019re doing the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not! I told you\u2026\u201d he trailed off, glancing at Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s my cue to leave,\u201d Harry said diplomatically. \u201cDraco, a quiet word before I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry led him over to a corner of the tiny apartment, and whispered something in his ear that made Draco go white, before Harry gave Hermione a wink and Apparated away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cPartly congratulations on being the man to win your heart fair and square, and partly a threat for if I hurt you in any way. He said he\u2019d heard of my interest in opera and told me I\u2019d have a fine future singing castrato if I hurt you, and that every Auror on the force would swear for him that he\u2019d acted in self-defence,\u201d Draco said nervously. \u201cYou know, when we break up, I think you\u2019re going to have to make sure I don\u2019t look like the bad guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I thought you could just cheat on me with Astoria. Done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNooo\u2026 no, no, no,\u201d he objected, waving his hands in the air in frantic denial. \u201cNot after what Potter just said. I know what <em>castrato</em> means, Hermione! I researched opera! No, it\u2019ll have to be you falling for someone else, or the two of us deciding amicably that things aren\u2019t working out, or that you want to focus on your career. Something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll decide the details later \u2013 something that won\u2019t get Harry mad at you,\u201d she promised. She didn\u2019t really like to think about it. Enacting step ten in her plan was a problem for later.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I guess you\u2019re not really sick, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all. It was just an excuse to get out of Ginny\u2019s hens night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stalked towards her, a gleam in his eye. \u201cAll alone then. No-one else expected to visit, I hope? My parents won\u2019t expect me home for another hour, here to fuss over an invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no-one else should be visiting,\u201d she said a little nervously. \u201cDid you want to\u2026 spend some time together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she said uncertainly. \u201cIf you want to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me show you how much I want to,\u201d he purred, and led her willingly to her bed. \u201cI want to find out how loud you can get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, just in case we get carried away,\u201d she said nervously, \u201cI want you to know that I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Muggle medicine that prevents pregnancy. A tiny tablet I take every day. Ron favoured charms, but I switched after I left him. I like the reliability of predicting my periods,\u201d she babbled. She didn\u2019t want to say, <em>I was thinking about sleeping with you</em>.<em> I\u2019ve been thinking about it for some time now.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow reliable is this Muggle pill?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cNinety-nine percent effective. Only one woman in a hundred using this method for a year will fall pregnant. It\u2019s not completely reliable, but very close to perfect \u2013 it\u2019s one of the best non-permanent options available. I don\u2019t mind if you want to use a charm as well. If it comes to that. Not that it will, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nodded. \u201cRight. Well, <em>should</em> we get carried away a quick spell is still a good idea, but this method sounds more reliable anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, about one in four women will get pregnant in a year even with spells. Of course, it depends on the competence and willpower of the caster, and if you\u2019re sensible enough to cast it <em>before</em> the act or not. Afterwards it won\u2019t do you as much good, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne in four!\u201d she yelled, outraged. \u201cRon told me it was a sure thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed, and Hermione turned on him furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t punish the messenger!\u201d he said defensively, with a low chuckle. \u201cI was just thinking that <em>that\u2019s</em> why there\u2019s so many Weasley spawn! His parents didn\u2019t even know what they were doing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she said sulkily. \u201cI could\u2019ve ended up pregnant. Trapped.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s laughter died down, and he wrapped an arm around her shoulder, pulling her into a comforting hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That would\u2019ve been dreadful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate Ron just that little bit more now,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cAnd Dumbledore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy him? You\u2019re not saying\u2026\u201d he said with a look of wide-eyed revulsion.</p>\n<p>\u201cEww! No, don\u2019t be disgusting! I meant as <em>Headmaster</em> he should\u2019ve ensured the students received sex education. About how babies are made, puberty, contraception, that sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco still looked appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s just not proper! Such things are the responsibility of parents to handle with tact and discretion. The school shouldn\u2019t presume to usurp that role.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so my parents the <em>dentists</em> should have told me all about the efficacy and failure rates of the Barrenness Hex, and the Infertility Charm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well, I suppose you have a point there. Perhaps a teacher or a senior student should have talked to the Muggle-borns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMcGonagall? <em>Snape</em>? <em>You</em>, Mr. Prefect? Can you see yourself counselling young wizards and witches about sexual diseases?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shuddered in an overly-dramatic fashion at all those suggestions. \u201cPoint. Well, perhaps Professor Sprout? She seemed an earthy, motherly type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, I can just see her now, explaining how to go about properly sucking a man\u2019s cock and the importance of preparation before having anal sex. Probably using a metaphor involving rosebuds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked very slowly. \u201cYou have scarred me mentally for life. I hope you know that,\u201d he said dryly.</p>\n<p>Hermione giggled. \u201cYou started it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what <em>do</em> you think they should have done for you lot, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBooks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a shock. Hermione Granger would\u2019ve loved to have a book to read. Or possibly some very naughty parchments. With illustrations and technical diagrams of what goes where.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione laughed and poked him in the ribs until he joined her in her laughter. They rolled around on her maroon bedsheets grappling for a while before he grabbed her hands to stop her tickling, pinning her beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione,\u201d he whispered, kissing her gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Draco?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ravish you now, if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very polite kind of ravishing!\u201d</p>\n<p>He grinned at her. \u201cThat\u2019s the best kind.\u201d Letting her hands go free, he ran a hand up her leg, under her robe, and she sighed with pleasure as his fingers ran over her inner thigh, evoking a shiver of pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco? You\u2019re wearing too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sat up on the bed, and pulled his robe off, leaving him wearing nothing but the odd-looking short button-up linen breeches that Ron had also favoured - the traditional wizarding equivalent of underwear.</p>\n<p>Draco looked at her a little anxiously as her eyes widened. She trailed a hand over his smooth, hairless chest, and traced the three large raised pink scars that ran diagonally across his chest. \u201cIs it\u2026 I know it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cVoldemort?\u201d she asked softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, actually,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cBut admittedly I was trying to curse him at the time. Not my finest moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! The Sectumsempra? I thought that wasn\u2019t supposed to scar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if I\u2019d gone to St. Mungo\u2019s it wouldn\u2019t have. But I didn\u2019t want any Aurors looking into the details of our fight too closely. Madam Pomfrey did what she could.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione leant down and kissed his chest, and he let out a shuddering sigh. \u201cI have my own scars,\u201d she said, and summoning up her Gryffindor courage she swiftly took off her own robe to hold out her arms for him to see the patchwork of multiple pink and white lines criss-crossing her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s why I prefer long sleeves most of the time. These are from your aunt.\u201d</p>\n<p>With only a brief irresistible glance at her breasts in their lacy bra, he picked her arms up one by one and laid a few gentle kisses on each patch of scars.</p>\n<p>Hermione pointed to some more scars on her body. \u201cThis one on my side\u2019s from the Whomping Willow in third year \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem too bad a cut so I didn\u2019t get it seen to in time to stop it scarring. There\u2019s a few small scars from the final battle - cutting Curses, mostly. Oh, and the one on my left leg is from a shattered bit of sink that hit me in first year when the boys were fighting the troll.\u201d Each mark got its own gentle kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d he said, tracing his fingers down a livid purple mark that ran from the underside of her right breast and down her chest to the left side of her stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cAntonin Dolohov. In the Department of Mysteries at the end of fifth year. It still aches whenever I get too overheated. Some kind of Dark flame curse, they said. This is the best the Healers could do. It\u2019s stable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky to be alive,\u201d he said gravely. He turned his left arm out for her to see the Dark Mark branded there on the inside of his forearm.</p>\n<p>She looked at it curiously. \u201cIt\u2019s faded. Sort of reddish-pink. I thought they were black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack when <em>he</em> was active. Fading now he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kiss that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to. Maybe kiss somewhere else?\u201d he suggested optimistically, trying to lighten the mood with their slightly macabre session of show-and-tell all finished.</p>\n<p>She started with his mouth, then moved on to his neck, finding him just as responsive there as she was. He didn\u2019t like her toying with his nipples though, and squirmed away uncomfortably at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I always like it,\u201d she said apologetically, and kissed her way down his belly instead.</p>\n<p>His fingers clenched in her hair, pushing her head softly downwards, and she mouthed at his penis through his breeches, lips soft on the outside of the fabric. He let out a guttural groan of pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes <em>please</em>,\u201d he moaned. \u201cMore, Hermione. Merlin, please more!\u201d</p>\n<p>Her fingers toyed slowly with the buttons, and he impatiently took over and did the last one and pushed his breeches down and threw them on her floor carelessly.</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s so beautiful</em>, she thought, as her hands roamed all over his body as she settled down to lie next to him on the bed. She peeked curiously at his average-sized but very attractive cock \u2013 the foreskin had retracted almost the whole way back he was so hard, leaving the head of the penis exposed and leaking a bit of pre-come. The scars on his chest aside, his skin was creamy white and unmarred by so much as a single freckle \u2013 she\u2019d seen enough of those to last a lifetime. His body was lean and lightly muscled. Ron had been starting to put on a little chub around the belly from too many pies and not enough exercise \u2013 he hadn\u2019t kept up with Quidditch practice the way Draco still did, and he didn\u2019t have the excuse of being a growing boy any longer.</p>\n<p>Determined not to think about her ex any longer, Hermione wrapped her hand around Draco\u2019s cock and started sliding her hand slowly up and down.</p>\n<p>Draco meanwhile was kissing at her exposed cleavage, while his hands crept behind her back to fumble with her bra clasp, eventually setting her breasts free from their lacy prison. His mouth dove straight to one nipple, sucking it enthusiastically and causing her to squeeze his cock a little too tightly for a moment, before her rhythmic pumping resumed.</p>\n<p>He switched to the other nipple, leaving the first a hard peak, covered wetly in a thin sheen of saliva. His fingers toyed with the hard little nub while he suckled the other to excited firmness. His head rolled to the side, tugging the nipple with a sharp twinge that was more pleasure than pain, and his blue-grey eyes stared into her own.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Draco Malfoy</em> is sucking on my nipple,\u201d she said wonderingly, not entirely meaning to say it out loud. It was so strange \u2013 at school she would never have thought in a million years she would be doing such a thing with him.</p>\n<p>His lips, still latched onto her breast, curved up in a smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement. His hand crept downwards, pushing underneath the elastic of her sensible black cotton underwear (she hated lace undies), and dove into the damp curls, hunting for her clitoris.</p>\n<p>\u201cA little lower, ah! No, up! There, yes. But\u2026 it\u2019s too dry\u2026\u201d she said pleadingly. His fingers ran across her moist entrance, making her shudder with pleasure, before returning to her clitoris and starting to massage it in gentle circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cFaster\u2026 no, not that fast. A little harder\u2026 goooood,\u201d she murmured. \u201cKeep up the circling for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mouth popped off her nipple and he grinned at her, \u201cBossy in bed as well as out of it, I see. Can\u2019t you just lie back and enjoy it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>am</em> enjoying it!\u201d she protested. He laughed before he resumed his enthusiastic attentions to her breasts.</p>\n<p>While it took him a while to learn exactly the speed and style she demanded, eventually his persistent compliance (and occasional stubborn innovation) yielded results, and worked her to a fever pitch of excitement. Her hand fell away from his cock, as she just grabbed at the sheets and enjoyed the sensations.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god Draco, use your mouth, please! I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, since you\u2019re begging,\u201d he said, sounding wickedly pleased. When he moved down to lick and suck at her clitoris she orgasmed with a loud low scream of pleasure. He didn\u2019t stop there, though, and she moaned and gasped as the aftershocks rippled through her body, and he pushed two fingers inside her wetly clenching cunt, feeling her vaginal walls squeezing around his fingers tightly as he thrust them in and out of her.</p>\n<p>Her hands were clenched in the bedsheets, his poor weeping cock long since forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was magnificent,\u201d she panted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy thank you my dear,\u201d he purred, wiping off his mouth with the back of his hand as he lay down next to her again. \u201cNow, perhaps it is my turn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d she said enthusiastically. \u201cI believe you said something about grabbing my hair while I sucked you off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow good of you to remember,\u201d he said playfully, and let out a deep hiss of pleasure as she knelt awkwardly over his legs, and sucked his hard cock deep into her warm, wet mouth.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long until his hands were indeed making a dreadful mess of her hair while his back arched as he spilled his seed into her mouth, and she spluttered and choked a little as he thrust too hard in the throes of passion, sperm dribbling out from the corners of her mouth.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t seem to mind though. And truth be told, neither did she.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems odd,\u201d mused Draco distractedly, lying in bed afterwards with her head resting his shoulder, one of her arms stretching across her bare stomach to gently stroke her hip and buttock, and his legs entwined messily with hers, \u201cPotter, the noble, Muggle-loving hero, letting himself be caught with a love potion by that ginger-haired harpy. Has he no self-respect? Why doesn\u2019t he leave her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor Snape often accused him of being arrogant. But it has always been very much the opposite. He\u2019s always felt his life and happiness were so much less valuable than anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s part of what makes him so brave and self-sacrificing \u2013 and yes, noble. But it\u2019s not healthy,\u201d sighed Hermione. \u201cHe knows staying with her will make Ginny happy, and all the rest of the Weasley family too. His own happiness comes a distant second to him compared to that, and I can\u2019t talk him out of it. He cares about her\u2026 but not as much as she cares for him. He doesn\u2019t believe he can do better, or deserves better. And he wants kids.\u201d She didn\u2019t tell Draco about Harry\u2019s theory about his mother being dosed with love potions when he was conceived. That wasn\u2019t her secret to tell, and certainly not to a Malfoy, no matter how pleasant a partner he was at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I said I <em>also</em> believe he deserves better than the Weaselette, I hope you would understand that it merely stems from my great dislike of the whole Weasel clan and their scheming ways, not out of some sickening hero-worship for him personally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Hermione said dryly, \u201cI won\u2019t accidentally credit you with any noble impulses.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughed at her witticism, and she quietly delighted in being with someone with enough intelligence to get her sarcastic humour without needing an explanation or an apology. Ron had usually demanded both.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a Muggle-lover,\u201d she said conversationally, as she stroked the fine, thin downy patch of hair on Draco\u2019s chest, so pale it was almost invisible.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry. You called him a Muggle-loving hero. But he\u2019s not Dumbledore \u2013 though frankly I think that man\u2019s reputation for being pro-Muggle rights was overstated too. Harry wants nothing to do with the Muggle world \u2013 he never has. Ever since he came to Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was peering at her suspiciously, watching her face for tells that she was lying, looking like he was waiting for the punchline to a very strange joke. \u201cHarry Potter, the Chosen One, the Man-Who-Conquered, sworn enemy of the Dark Lord and all blood purists \u2013 <em>doesn\u2019t like Muggles</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. He might not say so to the press of course, but the instant he could he cut ties to the Muggle world and never looked back. He fought Voldemort because he was a madman who killed his parents, wanted to kill him, and posed a significant threat to the wizarding world - especially non-pure-bloods,\u201d she said, ticking the points off on raised fingers as she listed them. \u201cNot because of Voldemort\u2019s anti-Muggle isolationist agenda. Harry actually approved of that part, not that he really ever wanted to talk about it. Obviously he couldn\u2019t be seen to agree with anything Voldemort said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco thought about it for a moment, before accepting the new information and striving to find a way to sink it into his worldview so it wouldn\u2019t disturb that placid pool of beliefs too much with any significant ripples. \u201cWell of <em>course</em> he\u2019d prefer the wizarding world,\u201d said Draco eventually. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t? I suppose the Dark Lord was a significant threat to all of us. Even those who nominally supported him like my family. We didn\u2019t have much choice <em>not</em> to, you know. At the end. I wouldn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c-I understand. Your family was at risk. We all can feel forced to do things we\u2019d rather not, to protect them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubbed at his forearm, at the faded brand of cowardice and forced servility there that he\u2019d never be rid of as long as he lived. \u201cYes. You understand more than most, then. I knew you did, from what mother told us you said in defence of her. Most Gryffindors still keep insisting I should\u2019ve stood up to Voldemort earlier \u2013 that death would\u2019ve been better than servitude. Most Gryffindors are idiots, of course. You\u2019ve always been an exception to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>His roundabout compliment on her intelligence warmed her. She couldn\u2019t remember Ron lying in bed with her complimenting her on anything except her body. It was a nice change.</p>\n<p>After a moment of quiet contemplation, lying together in quiet companionship as Draco traced lazy lines with his fingertips across the smooth skin on her bottom, she softly admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to Harry to convince him to leave her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2026 asking me for advice?\u201d he asked, pale eyebrows arching in disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose so. Who else <em>can</em> I ask? No-one\u2019s supposed to know about it \u2013 I promised Harry. You\u2019re just too sneaky a guesser. And all my ideas so far have failed \u2013 Harry\u2019s just unpersuadable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good you\u2019ve decided to turn to someone of superior breeding for advice then,\u201d he said with a sly smile, and laughed as she hit him gently with a pillow. \u201cI wish I had an easy answer for you, but the truth is you can\u2019t make someone make the smart choice. All you can do is be ready to help them when things go wrong. I\u2019ll send you the details of my family\u2019s lawyer \u2013 you should encourage him to sort out his will, and of course to draft the wedding contract carefully so she won\u2019t get much if or when he leaves her. If she\u2019s only in it for the money that might scare her off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do that, I guess. It might be worth a try. Yes, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said, with a decisive nod. Maybe Ginny <em>was</em> only in it for the money. She <em>said</em> she loved him, but that could be a lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried I\u2019ll go running to Skeeter with an exclusive about the Chosen One\u2019s emotional state and sad relationship? I could ruin him with this,\u201d he said with a wicked gleam in his eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cGinny might be ruined \u2013 and frankly if she was I\u2019d delight in that \u2013 but while Harry would be furious he\u2019d come out of it alright in the end, and you know your family\u2019s position is still too tenuous to risk your reputation. Besides, Skeeter wouldn\u2019t write it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d either burst into a rather attractive ranting fury at my words, or perhaps insist I\u2019m too kind-hearted to do such a thing. How fascinating you are, Hermione. A woman of surprising depth. And how can you be so sure they wouldn\u2019t publish? Money talks, and I am amply supplied with that. It would barely be necessary with such juicy gossip in any case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoney talks, but not louder than blackmail,\u201d Hermione grinned. \u201cSkeeter still won\u2019t write a word I disapprove of. She knows the price.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 have blackmail material on Skeeter,\u201d Draco echoed with surprised delight. His eyes darkened as he rolled over and grabbed both her wrists, pushing her down to pin her on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou naughty, naughty little snake,\u201d he purred, capturing her lips with a passionate kiss that took her breath away. \u201cOh, you Machiavellian minx. Such a goody two-shoes at school in the Golden Trio, and look at you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just <em>looked</em> like a goody two-shoes in school,\u201d she said archly. \u201cWe only got in trouble for less than half the stuff we did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione visited Malfoy Manor to meet Draco so they could travel to the wedding together, and also to take advantage of his mother\u2019s willingness to help her get her hair wrestled into submission into an artful and tidy chignon knot at the base of her neck. Narcissa had found some pearl-topped gold hairpins to help hold the decoratively arranged coils of hair in place, and a necklace set with golden sapphires to borrow that she said matched the butter-yellow robes beautifully, and was a Malfoy heirloom. As she was generally rather disinterested in the traditional feminine interests such as jewellery, she hadn\u2019t known before that sapphires came in colours other than blue. Narcissa seemed to enjoy showing off the contents of her jewellery box to Hermione, given that she responded with occasional gasps of admiration, but didn\u2019t show any signs of coveting her precious necklaces or rings, no matter how beautiful.</p>\n<p>She had a lot of make-up on her vanity table, Hermione noticed. \u201cI must admit I thought maybe you\u2019d do your make-up with charms,\u201d she commented.</p>\n<p>Narcissa shook her head. \u201cNo, those are too easy for someone to covertly counter-charm,\u201d she explained, sorting through another polished wooden box for a suitable matching bracelet to loan. \u201cWhat did you get the happy couple as a wedding gift?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d admitted Hermione. \u201cI mean, I know my half. I got them a pair of tickets to \u2018Cats\u2019 from us, but Draco\u2019s is buying a shared gift too, and he wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was. Only that if he could find one, it would be very appropriate and he was confident Harry would appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh yes, the actors dressed up like singing, dancing Kneazles \u2013 Draco told us all about it after you explained it to him. It sounds rather strange to me, but he is very keen for us all to go together as a family, with yourself included as his date and our guide to the Muggle world. He\u2019s still trying persistently to persuade Lucius, which is why we haven\u2019t purchased tickets yet. I think we shouldn\u2019t attend the same performance that the Potters will be going to, however. We don\u2019t want to disturb the happy newlyweds, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind an outing amongst Muggles?\u201d Hermione asked hesitantly, holding out her wrists so Narcissa could latch a braided gold bracelet around one. Narcissa, without asking, also spritzed both her wrists with a fine mist of perfume that smelled like roses and musk.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco has vouched for the quality and safety of the experience, and reassured us that there is no necessity to socialise with any Muggles. And my dear,\u201d she said with a serious look, \u201cI don\u2019t <em>hate</em> Muggles. I never did. I merely feel our worlds should remain as separate as possible \u2013 that we should stay away from them, and vice versa. However, I want my son happy \u2013 if seeing this \u2018musical\u2019 and \u2018operas\u2019 delights him, then I shall do my best to be accommodating.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a wave of her wand she levitated Hermione\u2019s delicately carved wooden chair around in a circle, so that Hermione could view her reflection in the vanity mirror. \u201cOh! I look beautiful!\u201d she said, turning her head back and forth to admire her twisted chignon with the pearl hairpins helping the charms hold everything in place, and providing a touch of decorative elegance.</p>\n<p>Hermione brushed a hand gently against the gold necklace with its waterfall of yellow sapphires. \u201cI shall take good care of your jewellery, Narcissa,\u201d she promised.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Hermione. I hope the wedding goes well. Do take good care of that which has been entrusted to you \u2013 I would hate to see anything damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded seriously, and silently wondered if they were still talking about jewellery.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Harry and Ginny had planned a lovely autumn-themed wedding, at Ginny\u2019s insistence. But the cool crisp weather she\u2019d hoped for was more grey and sleet filled, and the outdoors location they\u2019d initially selected had an abundance of mud rather than the carpet of sunset coloured oak leaves that Ginny had envisaged and expected. So they\u2019d reluctantly relocated the wedding to a large hired hall, and Molly stood at the door to welcome the guests inside, and to charm the mud off their shoes and dry their clothes from the rain, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The wedding was dull, and irritating. Unconsciously expecting the relative brevity of Christian style weddings, Hermione thought the whole business had far too many rituals, and was interminably long. There was handfasting with silk cords, jumping over a broom, blessings over wine, and what seemed like a million speeches. But then, her impatient and cranky mood might perhaps be more justly attributed to the fact that Harry had refused again, with a patient smile, her whispered suggestion to Apparate away before it was too late.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps it could also be because Ron was there. Standing up the front next to Harry, where she <em>had</em> to keep looking at him as he tugged uncomfortably at the tight collar of his brand new white formal robe and avoided making eye contact with her. Lavender Brown was sitting in the front row on the bride\u2019s side (Hermione and Draco had chosen the groom\u2019s side), making doe eyes at her Won-Won, and occasionally smirking across the aisle at Hermione. Hermione thought grumpily that she didn\u2019t seem to even be conscious of the fact that her cheap pink taffeta robes with sequins were <em>far outclassed</em> by Hermione\u2019s yellow Acromantula silk robes with seed pearls and genuine gold embroidery.</p>\n<p>Draco leaned over close to whisper in her ear, \u201cWant me to discreetly hex her? She could be spending the next hour trying to cope with an uncomfortable itch she mustn\u2019t scratch in public.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione turned to him with a smile and small shake of her head in the negative, and picked up his hand to give it a squeeze. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is my pleasure to do so,\u201d he said politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was our present from you?\u201d she whispered curiously. It was something small \u2013 the be-ribboned box he\u2019d set on the table next to her envelope had been tiny. \u201cDid you find the whatever-it-was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA toadstone ring,\u201d he said with a proud smirk. \u201cTo detect any magical poisons or potions contaminating your food or drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful idea,\u201d Hermione said quietly, and he put his arm around her shoulders to pull her snugly into cuddling at his side. His dark brown dress robes were very soft and warm \u2013 Narcissa had told her that they were made from angora wool.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey used to be a traditional gift to wealthy heirs on reaching their majority,\u201d Draco said quietly. \u201cIt seemed appropriate, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I could find a genuine one for sale, at first. The gem is of course a very ugly brown cabochon, but its utility makes up for a lot. It will heat up or change colour to orange if held near any potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hushed as the ceremony started. Ginny was beaming radiantly with happiness, and Hermione hated her for it. She plastered on a smile for Harry\u2019s sake. At least he looked happy too. She dearly hoped it wasn\u2019t an act.</p>\n<p>Eventually the horrible business of Harry vowing to love Ginny forever was over, to the applause of many and the disappointment of only a few. Molly cried noisy tears through the last half of it, but unfortunately Ginny didn\u2019t look at all upset by her mother\u2019s outburst, Hermione observed regretfully. She thought perhaps Bill\u2019s applause was a little lacklustre, but it could\u2019ve been her imagination.</p>\n<p>As they filed in and found their places at tables in the reception hall was crowded, Hermione couldn\u2019t decide if she was relieved or disappointed that they weren\u2019t at the same table as Ron and Lavender.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo many Weasleys,\u201d Draco muttered with a long-suffering sigh, as they headed for table two, where Bill, Fleur, and Charlie Weasley were sitting, along with Susan, Luna, and Luna\u2019s new boyfriend Rolf Scamander.</p>\n<p>\u201cCarl\u2019s not here?\u201d Hermione asked Susan, who\u2019d been seated next to Charlie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe broke up last week,\u201d she said with a sad shrug. \u201cNothing major to report, it was just\u2026 different interests. And he never got my jokes. It wasn\u2019t really working out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it seems mum has seated you next to yet another eligible young lady, Charlie,\u201d teased Bill.</p>\n<p>Charlie groaned with irritated frustration, and buried his face in his hands. Susan looked offended enough that Hermione took umbrage on her behalf. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing at all wrong with Susan,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cSo I see no cause for complaint. You don\u2019t have to date her, but you <em>should</em> be polite. If you know how to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in dating a <em>Weasley</em> anyway,\u201d huffed Susan indignantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it,\u201d said Bill, sounding amused. \u201cSay sorry to the nice young ladies, Charlie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charlie raised his head and saw everyone at the table, except for Bill and Fleur, glaring at him crossly. \u201cOh dear. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean any offence, Miss Bones,\u201d he said with excessive courtesy. \u201cIt\u2019s simply that mum keeps trying to set me up with \u2018nice young ladies\u2019 and just won\u2019t listen to me when I say I\u2019m not interested, I will <em>never</em> be interested, and that I\u2019m not going to get married and produce any grandkids for her to fuss over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe \u2018ave zat last part covered for you now,\u201d said Fleur with a proud smile, resting a hand meaningfully on the slight swell of her stomach. There was a chorus of delighted congratulations for the expectant couple.</p>\n<p>Susan forgave Charlie after such a polite apology, and they all chatted pleasantly enough over dinner. Apparently he\u2019d been very busy dealing with an outbreak of Squabb\u2019s Syndrome amongst the dragons. Bouts of sneezing were a very serious and dangerous problem for fire-breathing creatures.</p>\n<p>No-one mentioned Ron at all, or Hermione\u2019s split from him, and perhaps that was for the best. She didn\u2019t really want to drag <em>all</em> the Weasleys into their mess.</p>\n<p>While Draco was slow-dancing later on with Hermione, his hands roaming only <em>a smidgen</em> lower than society deemed acceptable, Ron seemed like he was going to approach them. But when he got close enough to hear that Draco was humming \u201cWeasley is Our King\u201d under his breath, he scowled and turned away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d muttered Hermione crossly. \u201cYou scared him off. I want my scene.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve guessed a lion would be so faint hearted? And now he\u2019s gone to dance with Brown as if he wouldn\u2019t rather do anything else. But he\u2019s still watching you when you\u2019re not looking,\u201d Draco reported.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do I do now? I don\u2019t want to be <em>seen</em> to deliberately provoke him,\u201d she asked plaintively. \u201cKiss me. Make it look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco thought for a moment as he spun her around the dancefloor, then pulled her in close for a passionate kiss as the song ended. His lips tasted faintly like apples, from the sorbet they\u2019d had for dessert. \u201cGo and gossip with a friend about what a fantastic lover I am,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cLet him overhear. I think me being with you is scaring him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione brushed a hand along his smooth shaved jawline, and kissed him again. \u201cThank you, my darling dragon,\u201d she said, with a loving smile. Then in a swirl of robes she was off to find Susan.</p>\n<p>Susan mightn\u2019t have been aware of her plans, but she was always happy to gossip, though it took a little time to lead the conversation around to Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what I found out about Charlie!\u201d Susan hissed excitedly. \u201cHe has a boyfriend in Romania!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really, he\u2019s gay? Well why didn\u2019t he just say so?\u201d Hermione said, only mildly surprised. She\u2019d wondered a bit if he might be gay after his too-firm pronouncement that he\u2019d never marry. She\u2019d worried a little that maybe he\u2019d been affected by a love potion in utero as well, so it was reassuring to hear that his reluctance to consider Susan as a partner was just because he wasn\u2019t attracted to women. And wasn\u2019t actually single, obviously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmit such a thing as a pure-blood wizard? The disgrace, my dear!\u201d Susan said, shocked. \u201cYou don\u2019t simply discuss such things in public!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re telling <em>me</em> in public,\u201d Hermione rebutted logically.</p>\n<p>Susan giggled. \u201cWell yes\u2026 but very, very quietly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to hear some more gossip that probably shouldn\u2019t be shared?\u201d Hermione asked, with a naughty smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes please!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione led her over to near the drinks table. Just behind a pillar Ron was talking with another guest. She turned her back to him, as if she hadn\u2019t noticed him standing nearby.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to hear a secret about Draco?\u201d she whispered, a little too loudly on purpose.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is\u2026 a <em>fantastic</em> lover,\u201d Hermione said, grinning broadly. \u201cI mean, without the potion\u2019s influence Ron\u2019s attentions were rather lacklustre. But Draco really knows his way around a woman\u2019s body, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou naughty thing!\u201d laughed Susan loudly, and then leaned in to give her a tight hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to make Ron jealous?\u201d she whispered very quietly, breath soft on Hermione\u2019s ear. \u201cBecause he\u2019s right behind you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hermione murmured back softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Susan breathed quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how well-endowed is your new man?\u201d she asked playfully as she drew back from the hug, evoking a shocked laugh from Hermione.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?!\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to ask me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about his bank balance, obviously!\u201d Susan said with a wink. \u201cWhat were <em>you</em> thinking of?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione giggled. \u201cWell I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s ample. Very satisfyingly large\u2026 amount of money. Biggest vault I\u2019ve ever seen, actually. Puts a certain other vault I\u2019ve viewed to shame. Draco can really provide for <em>all</em> my needs, monetary and otherwise, with a vault like his.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron in fact had a slightly bigger cock than Draco did, but it wasn\u2019t like they were ever going to whip them out to compare them, so she felt pretty secure in that lie never being found out by either of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 bitch!\u201d Ron\u2019s voice was loud and angry.</p>\n<p>Hermione spun around in pretended shock. \u201cRon!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou damned whore!\u201d he shouted, face red with anger, spittle flying from his mouth. \u201cI thought you were mad at me for you know\u2026 but it was the money, wasn\u2019t it? All along! You just wanted a big cock and a big pile of Galleons, and I wasn\u2019t enough for you!\u201d</p>\n<p>People around them were hushing to listen to the unexpected show, and Lavender had gone over and was trying to tug him away. \u201cRon, let\u2019s just go, forget about her,\u201d she pleaded, but he shook her hand off his elbow without even looking at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much does he pay you? Is it worth it? He\u2019ll never marry a Mudblood whore like you \u2013 that\u2019s all he thinks of you as, you know! He\u2019ll cast you off and <em>you\u2019ll have nothing</em>!\u201d he said, spitting out the last words at Hermione with vicious emphasis.</p>\n<p>Draco walked over to stand at her left side (Susan was standing supportively on her right), and glared regally at Ron. \u201cIs he bothering you, \u2018Mione?\u201d</p>\n<p>He was, actually. She\u2019d wanted this \u2013 wanted him furiously angry. But it was also a little frightening to be the target of all that rage, and she was suddenly glad her gown had a pocket large enough to stow her wand in. She slipped her right hand in her pocket to hold it, for comfort. \u201cHe is, rather,\u201d she said with a dismissive sniff and a superior air worthy of a pure-blood heiress.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suggest you apologise for your insulting language to my girlfriend, Weasley,\u201d Draco said in a mildy menacing tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care about you! She\u2019s just using you to make <em>me</em> jealous!\u201d Ron yelled at him.</p>\n<p>Draco quirked an eyebrow. \u201cAccusing me of your own sins there, aren\u2019t you Weasley?\u201d he drawled, with a meaningful glance at Lavender\u2019s upset face where she stood a step behind Ron, still ignored. \u201cShe loves me. \u2018Mione chose me freely. Whereas you\u2026 <em>your</em> only attraction came from a bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Ron yelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rapist,\u201d Hermione said to Lavender, looking straight into her eyes, trying to communicate the seriousness of the situation to her. \u201cIf you tire of him, he\u2019ll drug you into staying. Is that a risk you want to take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you say that! You\u2019re ruining my daughter\u2019s wedding,\u201d sobbed Molly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have,\u201d Hermione said testily, glancing at Ginny\u2019s white face as she clung tightly to Harry\u2019s hand. He was just standing there looking solemn and sad. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t. Your idiotic youngest son is giving his best shot at ruining the reception, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe chose me, Weasley, the better man. And you\u2019ve <em>lost her forever</em>,\u201d Draco said tauntingly, then reached out to hold Hermione\u2019s hand, lifting it up to plant a kiss on it while smirking at Ron. Hermione decided to forego her promised retribution for Draco kissing her while looking at someone else. It was a fine taunt, after all. And it worked much more effectively on Ron than it had on Harry.</p>\n<p>With an angry wordless yell Ron drew his wand, and then shot a spell at Draco with a crackling streak of red light. \u201c<em>Calvorio</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione whipped her wand out quickly and waved it in a tight circle. \u201c<em>Protego</em>!\u201d she incanted, and a shimmering shield of gold sparkles reflected the crimson beam of light straight back at Ron, hitting him squarely.</p>\n<p>Ron let out a short cry of frustration as his shaggy red hair slid over his face obscuring his vision. But it wasn\u2019t growing\u2026 it was falling out. He reached up a hand to brush his hair out of his eyes, and it scattered all over his robes, and with every tiny movement of his head it fell to the ground like a soft fuzzy rain, leaving him in seconds with a smooth and shiny bare freckled scalp.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop fighting, Ron!\u201d warned Harry loudly, looking over sadly at his oldest friend. \u201cNot one more spell, I\u2019m warning you. Let her go free. You owe her that much, at least. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco tugged his right hand free of Hermione\u2019s, and drew his own wand. Ron looked ready to continue the fight, but Bill had moved in to stand in between them and Ron, while Charlie and Arthur moved in to grab a hold of him. They started frog-marching him out of the hall, despite the soft shower of rain outside. Ron\u2019s dad was keeping up a constant soothing line of patter about how he should calm down, and everything would be okay.</p>\n<p>\u201cGinny doesn\u2019t need this at her wedding, Ron, and neither does Harry,\u201d Charlie said firmly but calmly. \u201cShe\u2019s moved on, Ron. You need to as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019ll come crawling back! When he throws her over, and you know he will!\u201d Ron insisted, as his father sighed and pulled him outside, grip firm on his wand arm. \u201cAnd she cost me my job, dad! My job!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lavender looked forlornly after them, tears in her eyes. She walked up to Hermione, and Draco pointed his wand discreetly at her, just in case, hand down at his side with his wand mostly hidden by the folds of his dark brown robe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sniffed. \u201cI thought\u2026 well. He said a lot of things I don\u2019t think he meant, now. I just want you to know that I wish you and Malfoy every happiness. And\u2026 I think Ron and I are over for good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione hugged her and asked her if she wanted to talk about it, but Lavender pulled away quickly, plucking a hanky from the reticule at her waist to dab at her eyes carefully. \u201cThank you, but no. I don\u2019t want to ruin my make-up.\u201d She plastered on a brave smile. \u201cBetter to learn now, rather than later, that he doesn\u2019t really care about me. I\u2019m going to go find some wine, and someone to dance with.\u201d</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Harry and Ginny were away on their honeymoon, and Ron had been humiliated in public, and his life ruined, just like Hermione had wanted. She knew she should be thinking about how to break up with Draco convincingly, in a way that wouldn\u2019t get him in trouble with her overprotective friends. But she was putting it off. In her ten step master plan, step seven had been planned to be a big media interview about how happy she was with Draco, compared to Ron, and step eight was going to be implying she was sleeping with Draco, and being seen Flooing to his house for the evening. But those steps weren\u2019t really needed any more \u2013 she\u2019d already gotten the reaction from Ron she\u2019d craved and didn\u2019t need to scale up her provocation any longer. Step nine was a public date with an argument, and then the final step was breaking up.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t <strong>want</strong> to break up with Draco</em>, she told herself as convincingly as she could in the face of rising melancholy, <em>it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t think of a particularly good plan to execute yet. Obviously our relationship\u2019s not going to last \u2013 there\u2019s too much against it. His family wouldn\u2019t accept me for starters, and he doesn\u2019t like me <strong>that</strong> much. But he didn\u2019t like my plan of him \u201ccheating\u201d on me with Astoria, and I haven\u2019t thought of an alternative yet. Besides, I have all this mail to answer before I can devote time to planning</em>. <em>And my flat is a mess.</em></p>\n<p>There <em>was</em> a big pile of unanswered letters to attend to in her tiny little flat. Being prominently featured in the wizarding media for months had led to a lot of owls bringing her mail. Some letters she burned without reading them after detection spells found hexes or jinxes on the parchment. She\u2019d learnt those detection spells back in fourth year after she\u2019d been deluged with mail, sometimes hexed, accusing her of toying with both Harry and Victor\u2019s affections. Others were safer to read, and she answered with brief messages of thanks for their support, or confirmation that yes, it <em>was</em> true that she\u2019d been drugged by Ron, and/or was dating Draco.</p>\n<p>A few messages required more thoughtful responses, and those she\u2019d set aside for a less busy time so she could respond properly. Victor Krum had written worriedly to check on her \u2013 the gossip finally having reached Bulgaria. He said he understood better now why she\u2019d stopped writing to him, and hoped she was well. He had a new girlfriend, whom he mentioned as tactfully as possible, and he sent his best wishes for her relationship with Draco. He also promised to come to her aid against Ron \u2013 if she needed his help she had but to ask. She smiled at his offer \u2013 it wasn\u2019t needed, but it was appreciated all the same.</p>\n<p>Three other messages brought grief and anger, rather than smiles. Two separate people \u2013 an Irish witch and an older German wizard \u2013 had written to share their shame and anger about being drugged with \u201clove\u201d potions into someone\u2019s bed. A third young witch (Maria \u201cVillanueva\u201d from Spain) wrote sadly about how she\u2019d been facing pressure from her family to marry the man who\u2019d tricked her into his bed, and had been contemplating suicide.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThey tell me it was my fault for succumbing to his wiles, and I should have taken more care. And that now my reputation is ruined there is no choice for me but marriage. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHowever, your bravery in telling the world your story, sharing how it was his shame, not yours, is an inspiration to me. I have resolved to cast off my family and leave my home, and I\u2019ve recently found a broom-maker in Andalucia willing to take me on as an Apprentice.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Maria finished her letter with many effusive best wishes for Hermione\u2019s happiness in life, whether it be with Draco or on her own, and a hope that one day love potions would be illegal all across the world, and the laws and punishments made so strict that no man would ever again dare to use one on a woman who\u2019d spurned his unwanted attentions.</p>\n<p>It made Hermione stop and think. Admittedly laws about potion regulation weren\u2019t the responsibility of her own Department at the Ministry, but\u2026 laws could be changed. She knew that. She worked on them all the time, for the betterment of magical creatures. But whose responsibility <em>were</em> the potion regulations? Someone should draft a bill about them to put before the Wizengamot. Perhaps that someone could be her.</p>\n<p>It was while her head was stuck in the Floo with green flames licking all around it as she gossiped with Susan about which Department looked after potion laws that there came a demanding knock on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cSusan, I have to go, I have a visitor,\u201d she apologised.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Draco, don\u2019t call me back,\u201d teased Susan. \u201cI\u2019ll just assume you\u2019re <em>busy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSusan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye now!\u201d Susan said in a rush, and cut off the connection at her end hastily.</p>\n<p>Hermione opened her front door with a smile. Draco did seem the most likely visitor, for Harry was still on his honeymoon in Greece.</p>\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t Draco. It was a thin, young dark-haired woman wearing stylish green dress robes and a pointed hat with a couple of fluffy creamy white feathers tucked into one side of the hatband.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Hermione asked politely.</p>\n<p>The woman frowned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you <em>know</em> who I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hermione hesitated, looking at her closely. A classmate she should recognise? It\u2019d been a few years now, and everyone looked a little different. She\u2019d almost walked past Katie Bell in Diagon Alley the other day, without recognising her at all. This lady did look a little familiar. Something about the thin cheekbones, and the look on her face as she sneered reminded her of\u2026 Daphne Greengrass. She knew her now. She\u2019d seen her photo briefly in <em>Witch Weekly</em>, some months ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cAstoria,\u201d she said, hollowly.</p>\n<p>She nodded. \u201cI think we need to talk, Miss Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was quite possibly the most uncomfortable conversation Hermione had ever faced, and drinking tea together wasn\u2019t making it any better, though Astoria appeared to almost be making an effort to put her at ease with small talk, oddly enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is very nice tea, Miss Granger. What blend is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Grey. It\u2019s a Twinings brand loose leaf tea. It\u2019s one of my favourites.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has an interesting flavour,\u201d Astoria said politely, sipping delicately at the tea \u2013 black, with one sugar. Her words were polite, and she was smiling as she gazed around the tiny run-down flat, but it didn\u2019t seem like a kind smile. More\u2026 triumphant. Hermione cringed on the inside as she imagined her sneering condemnation of her poky old apartment. She\u2019d been meaning to find somewhere better. She <em>could</em> afford somewhere better. She\u2019d simply not gotten around to it \u2013 she\u2019d been in such a hurry when she left Ron that she\u2019d grabbed the first accommodation that was remotely suitable.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s added bergamot and citrus. But you didn\u2019t come here to discuss my choice of tea, Miss Greengrass.\u201d Best to get it over with fast. Like ripping off a plaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine you can guess why I\u2019m here, now you\u2019ve ascertained who I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to talk about Draco,\u201d Hermione said, attempting to assume a businesslike air.</p>\n<p>Astoria nodded. \u201cYes. So, if you want to get straight to business, you may simply tell me everything I wish to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione hesitated. She was just supposed to <em>guess</em>?</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Miss Granger. Don\u2019t I deserve to know exactly what\u2019s going on?\u201d Astoria\u2019s eyes glimmered with sadness as she directed a pleading look at Hermione.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s rather vague. You ah\u2026 of course you are aware we\u2019ve been dating\u2026 pretending to date?\u201d</p>\n<p>Astoria nodded. \u201cOf course. Yet it has gone on much longer than I expected. And with more\u2026 verisimilitude. Exactly how much is acting? For I have been awaiting my beau\u2019s return to my side, and yet still he is with you. Are you attempting to steal him from me forever, Miss Granger? Because we were in very promising contract negotiations, prior to your current arrangement with Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t\u2026 that is, there\u2019s nothing that would potentially result in pregnancy,\u201d Hermione said, very awkwardly, but with a desire to come clean. \u201cWhich I was told was your boundary you asked of him. We have\u2026 done other things, however. Made out a few times.\u201d She drank her tea, for something to do. It was still a bit too hot, but she drank it anyway.</p>\n<p>Astoria looked irritated and pensive, but not inclined to throw her tea at the wall or draw her wand. Thank Merlin for small mercies. \u201cThat was not a boundary I expected would ever be reached. You have kissed him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeen him unclothed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Yes. And to save us both some embarrassment I\u2019m afraid to say that unless your next question is \u2018Have you had intercourse?\u2019 the answer is probably going to be yes to that one too. Shouldn\u2019t you be asking these things of Draco, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>With an angry huff, Astoria drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cI appreciate your candour, but not your attitude or your poaching, Miss Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am willing to break up with him given a little time,\u201d Hermione said stiffly. \u201cIf it\u2019s too sudden people will be suspicious, and Harry would be extremely angry with Draco. It could go badly for him. But I\u2019m not stopping him from returning to you, or attempting to \u2018poach\u2019 him. I do appreciate your patience and understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Astoria nodded. The regal look she was trying to assume would suit her better in ten or twenty years\u2019 time \u2013 it looked rather affected on a woman who was younger than Hermione, barely out of her teens.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are concerned for Draco\u2019s reputation,\u201d Astoria stated, rather than asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione paused to think, flummoxed. \u201cWell, it just seems the right thing to do,\u201d she said eventually. \u201cHe\u2019s been very\u2026 helpful. Kind, and friendly. I appreciate his assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Astoria raised an eyebrow, and placing an elbow on the table, rested her chin in one hand. \u201cHas he now? How very <em>interesting</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione blushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when is he planning on leaving you, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t really discussed it yet,\u201d Hermione said hesitantly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get around to it soon. He did mention a couple of days ago that his father said he was expecting to see him break up with me soon. But he didn\u2019t want to do so right after we\u2019d been to Harry\u2019s wedding. Ron would gloat. But we don\u2019t have a future together, obviously, and he\u2019s not in love with me. We <em>are</em> separating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you now,\u201d said Astoria sceptically. \u201cAnd does he talk about me often?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no. That would be rather awkward, naturally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s stopped writing to me,\u201d Astoria said, accusingly. \u201cI need to know if I\u2019m wasting my time waiting for Draco, Miss Granger. I have another suitor interested in me. I am a rather <em>eligible</em> young witch, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. Well, I wish you all the best with whomever you choose,\u201d Hermione said politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be happy if that man I choose is Draco?\u201d Astoria asked, watching her rival closely. \u201cYou\u2019re perfectly satisfied that your revenge on Mr Weasley is concluded, and you don\u2019t care for the loss of Draco as your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m quite happy!\u201d Hermione insisted. Her smile was forced, rather than natural, as she spoke. \u201cAfter all, revenge on Ron was all I wanted, and I\u2019ve accomplished that now. Draco can\u2026 he can do what he wants. He doesn\u2019t want me. Not\u2026 not to keep. I knew that from the start, of course. His family would never accept me as a serious match, and neither would he.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis parents are rather severe and demanding, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re not so bad when you get to know them I suppose. It\u2019s nothing compared to what I feared at first. Lucius is strictly business, but Narcissa grows on you with time. She did my hair for the wedding, which was very kind of her. But of course she doesn\u2019t expect Draco to marry me or anything. I know she disapproves of that possibility \u2013 she made it crystal clear right from the start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Astoria said, sipping the last of her tea. \u201cWell, it has been an enlightening conversation, Miss Granger. Thank you for your hospitality, but I think I shall be on my way now. I need to have a little chat with Draco.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded, and didn\u2019t let the sigh locked inside her escape. <em>Well, it was fun while it lasted</em>, she thought sadly.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Draco got in touch with her over the Floo the next evening to discuss Astoria\u2019s visit with him, and its consequences.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is expecting us to separate soon,\u201d he said hesitantly, \u201cI assume that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems the most sensible course of action,\u201d Hermione said practically. She\u2019d braced herself for the conversation, and had roughed out a plan. She always felt better, steadier, with a couple of hours\u2019 research and a plan under her belt. She pulled out her notes, while Draco\u2019s head watched her from the fireplace\u2019s flickering green flames. \u201cI was thinking we could break up in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. That will give us time to have another amicable public date, so it doesn\u2019t look like you dumped me right after we declared our affection for each other at the wedding, and will also let us attend \u2018Cats\u2019 together with your family, if they still want to go. We can also then proceed to step nine of my original plan, and stage a public argument.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded gravely. \u201cThat seems sensible. But I\u2019d prefer to make it six weeks, because I bought us two tickets to <em>La Traviata</em>, and I\u2019d like to have your company for that. It would be a shame to waste the ticket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could take your mother instead?\u201d Hermione suggested.</p>\n<p>He shook his head, and the green flames danced around his face. \u201cNo, I\u2019d be too nervous out in the Muggle world without a guide, at this stage. Perhaps after I\u2019ve done it another time or two it wouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then, a month and a half it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll stage our first argument after that,\u201d Draco said. \u201cDid you decide on a preferred reason for us to break up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I have a few ideas, but I expect you still don\u2019t want it to be because you\u2019re in love with Astoria?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t do. I don\u2019t want a reputation as being fickle, or cruelly spurning a heroine of the war. And objecting to Muggle things won\u2019t do either \u2013 we\u2019ve worked hard as a family to reform our image and I won\u2019t have those efforts tarnished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, I thought perhaps I could have insisted that I don\u2019t ever want to have children, and you and your family objected to that, as it would mean no Malfoy heir. That I\u2019d rather focus on my career.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked, and looked rather startled. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have children? Ever?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good story. It doesn\u2019t need to be totally true,\u201d she said with a casual shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you <em>do</em> want children?\u201d he asked persistently.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe in five or ten years. With the right man. I wouldn\u2019t hypothetically be averse to it, but only once my career was more established. I wouldn\u2019t want one <em>now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, I see. Well, that certainly sounds like a very adequate reason to break up, that won\u2019t tarnish either of our reputations unduly. For I would certainly expect at least one child of a prospective bride, somewhere along the line. And after all, if you later decide you <em>do</em> want children, you can always just tell the press that I wasn\u2019t the right man, but now you\u2019ve found someone new and special, it\u2019s the right time for children after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHypothetically. But I\u2019m in no rush. I doubt there\u2019s a \u2018right man\u2019 who would change my mind about giving up my career to change diapers for a living. Or even for six months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. \u201cI think a dinner party would be suitable to set the scene for our argument. I can invite a few friends, and you can invite Harry and Susan. Leave it with me to plan, if you will. For six or seven weeks\u2019 time, after the opera.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so it was settled. As Draco disappeared from the fireplace, and the green fire changed colour and died down to a gentle orange crackling lick of tiny flames over the charred logs, Hermione admitted to herself that she would be very sorry to see their relationship end. She wished\u2026 wished it didn\u2019t have to. At least she had six more weeks to enjoy with him. It was more than she\u2019d expected.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Draco took her on a picnic, the next week. They talked about her career in the Ministry, and his own quiet ambitions to advance his family\u2019s business interests.</p>\n<p>\u201cI always used to dream of running for Minister one day, but well, that\u2019s not going to be an option any more. Our reputation is improving, but I doubt it\u2019ll ever improve to the point that I\u2019d win an election,\u201d he admitted with a sigh. \u201cI think I enjoy business more anyway. There\u2019s less pandering to idiots than the Minister has to put up with. We\u2019ve got investments in farming magical plants, wool, some vineyards, three retail businesses, and we\u2019re funding a very promising new enchanter of magical furniture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPandering to idiots is an essential and unavoidable part of a career in the Ministry, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Hermione agreed. \u201cI know Kingsley finds it very frustrating at times. It can be very slow getting legislation through the Wizengamot \u2013 <em>that</em> I have personal experience with. I\u2019m not always the best at networking in person, so I mostly stick to writing persuasive letters. And I\u2019m constantly re-writing my drafts to be shorter, ever since Kingsley dropped a six foot carefully researched missive I\u2019d written him straight into my office bin - right in front of me! He warned me that he didn\u2019t have the time to read that much, and there were no extra House points or marks given for essay length now I was out of Hogwarts. He said he wasn\u2019t alone in throwing anything too long straight in the bin, or leaving it unread or pushed aside to languish for weeks or months, and it was time for me to learn how to be <em>succinct</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed at her, and Hermione smiled ruefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how long are your letters now?\u201d he asked with amusement in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI stick to two feet or less. It\u2019s a personal challenge \u2013 I try and write the best letters and reports I can within that length.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTiny writing?\u201d he teased.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d she laughed. \u201cThat would be cheating!\u201d</p>\n<p>They finished off their meal of roast quail, soft cheeses, and fresh figs, and packed the leftovers back into the basket. She sat behind him on his broomstick, clutching tightly at his waist as they flew back to the manor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you hate flying!\u201d Draco called over his shoulder. \u201cYour friends were all Quidditch mad!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you please watch where you\u2019re going?\u201d she squeaked unhappily, holding tighter.</p>\n<p>While Draco was putting away the basket and broom, Narcissa stopped by to greet Hermione.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Hermione, how are you?\u201d she asked courteously. \u201cThe weather held for your picnic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it was cloudy and cool, but not unpleasant,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cNo rain, luckily.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you care to join me for a cup of tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione blinked, startled. \u201cWell, I was just about to head home. I know it\u2019s the weekend, but I have some draft proposals to work on\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour work will still be there later, but I have so <em>few</em> visitors,\u201d Narcissa said, looking sad and wistful. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione folded faster than a poker player with nothing but a ten high. \u201cOh, of course I would <em>love</em> to stay for tea with you if I\u2019m not intruding. I just didn\u2019t want to be a bother,\u201d she said sympathetically.</p>\n<p>Narcissa led her away to a sunny little parlour, and her brief look of triumph went unnoticed by Hermione.</p>\n<p>She served the tea and a little plate of wafer-thin crisp cinnamon biscuits, and Hermione wondered if Draco knew she was still here, or would assume she\u2019d headed home like she\u2019d announced she would be doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo tell me more about <em>you</em>, Hermione,\u201d Narcissa said conversationally. \u201cI\u2019m curious about your family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my parents are both dentists \u2013 Muggle Healers who specialise in teeth. They live in Australia now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you see them often?\u201d she asked politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not very. We\u2019re in touch, but it\u2019s a little awkward. I\u2026 I cast some memory charms on them during the war. To help keep them safe, and so they couldn\u2019t be interrogated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa frowned. \u201cBut how would that have helped? Surely sending them abroad was sufficient?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione sighed. \u201cI panicked. I was young, and I panicked. I thought that if they knew nothing about me, or about the magical world, that everyone would leave them alone. And they\u2019d stop insisting I leave Harry to fight the war on his own. They wanted me to settle down in hiding in the Muggle world and forget all about the magical world. They were scared for me, while I was scared for them. I tried to undo the spells after the war, but it was harder than I expected. They still don\u2019t have their full memories back, and they were\u2026 so angry with me for quite a while. After I realised I\u2019d made a mistake, and apologised sincerely, things started getting better. We chat on the phone every few weeks, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a child\u2019s place to protect their parents,\u201d Narcissa said rebukingly.</p>\n<p>Hermione raised an eyebrow. \u201cPerhaps not. I wasn\u2019t the only child in the war who did their best to do so, however.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa glanced uncomfortably away to one side. \u201cWell, Draco had little choice by the end there. We protected him as best we could for as long as we could. Shall we change the topic, my dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p>\n<p>They chatted for a good long while over tea, about Hermione\u2019s siblings and cousins (that part was fast, because she had none), her ambitions in the Ministry, and what her parent\u2019s home and business in Australia were like.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you have any magical relatives? The Dagworth-Grangers, perhaps?\u201d Narcissa asked with studied casualness.</p>\n<p>Hermione levelled a frown at her. \u201cProfessor Slughorn mentioned them once. But no. No other witches or wizards in my family. Not my parents, and not my grandparents. If there are any magical relatives, they\u2019re no earlier than my great-grandparents\u2019 generation, and they stayed quiet about it. I\u2019m Muggle-born, through and through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, I didn\u2019t mean to make you uncomfortable,\u201d Narcissa said apologetically. \u201cIt was just idle curiosity. Shall we have a little chat about some of my relatives instead? Those acceptable to talk about in a friendly conversation, of course. I understand Mr Potter is godfather to my great-nephew, I think they called him Teddy, or is it Theodore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Edward\u2019, officially. But everyone calls him Teddy, and he\u2019s not old enough to raise any objection to it yet! He\u2019s a little sweetheart,\u201d Hermione said with a fond smile.</p>\n<p>They chatted for a while about Teddy and his Metamorphmagus powers that he\u2019d inherited from his mother (not seen in the Black line for generations before her) and the range of Tonks\u2019 abilities when she\u2019d been alive and how they compared to Teddy\u2019s, and they parted cordially with Hermione promising to relay an olive branch of well wishes from Narcissa to Andromeda the next time they saw each other.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>\u201cMagical Mr Mistoffelees,\u201d Lucius sang quietly and softly to himself in an absent-minded fashion, with his arm around his wife\u2019s waist as they waited with Draco and Hermione for their taxi to arrive at the theatre. Draco had gotten careful instructions from Hermione on how to use a phone and a phone book, to book one for them himself as part of his personal quest to become familiar enough with the Muggle world to safely navigate his way to and from the theatres and opera houses.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s much less grumpy than he was when he arrived,\u201d whispered Hermione with amusement to Draco. \u201cHe reminds me of someone, but I <em>can\u2019t quite think who</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed as she whispered in his ear, and Narcissa glanced over at the two of them with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot so bad, was it father?\u201d Draco said with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdequate, I suppose,\u201d his father grudgingly agreed. But he was smiling too.</p>\n<p>Their taxi for the return journey to Diagon Alley when it arrived turned out to be a limousine.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy idea,\u201d said Draco smugly. \u201cIt\u2019s like a taxi, but much better quality.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better than that poky little carriage we took on the way here,\u201d Lucius said with an approving nod, climbing inside cautiously when the driver opened the door for them. \u201cAh! Dear, there\u2019s champagne in here!\u201d</p>\n<p>They all piled in to sit very comfortably on the plump leather seats, and Hermione seized the opportunity provided by the privacy of the driver being well separated from them to chat with Lucius about her upcoming bill.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Lucius, I wondered if you had a chance to consider supporting the bill going before the Wizengamot about outlawing love potion use on Muggles and banning its sale and use by anyone underage?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius sighed with exasperation. \u201cI appreciate your personal difficulties, but such measures are common sense, and I don\u2019t see they need to be written into legislation, of which we have too much already. Anyone intending to act so won\u2019t be inclined to pay attention to the law in any case. And the wizarding laws are designed to protect and guide wizards and witches, so I see no necessity for protecting Muggles. Let their own laws suffice for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaws against thievery and murder are common sense too,\u201d she argued, \u201cyet we still outlaw them. And importantly, we put <em>penalties</em> in place for those who breach them. You wouldn\u2019t use a love potion on a Muggle now, would you? And you wouldn\u2019t want Draco or Narcissa doing so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be disgusting,\u201d he said with a sneer. \u201cNo decent pure-blood would sully themselves so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked at Hermione a little anxiously, but she remained calm, looking if anything rather smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen there\u2019s no harm in outlawing it, is there? You\u2019ll get to be seen to be a liberated, open-minded man who has come to support Muggle rights, with no personal loss of freedom whatsoever. No impact on the wizarding world, except perhaps slightly less half-blood wizards and witches being born,\u201d she wheedled persuasively.</p>\n<p>Lucius blinked. \u201cWell, I suppose so. Excellent points, I must say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t have liked to have seen Draco as a young man ensnared by a love potion during his time at Hogwarts now, would you? Ensnared by any Muggle-born with enough money to purchase Amortentia from the Weasleys owl order service? There were a few young girls \u2013 and perhaps a few young <em>men</em> \u2013 who would\u2019ve been <em>delighted</em> to see him humiliated as he chased after them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius nodded slowly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have his toadstone ring yet then\u2026 he wasn\u2019t of age.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s so many opportunities to tamper with food at Hogwarts\u2019 crowded tables. Don\u2019t young pure-blood witches and wizards deserve protection from someone trying to sully the purity of their sacred family lines and entrap them into a marriage? Not all children have Draco\u2019s caution and superior upbringing to be wary of what they eat and drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius smirked at her as he said, \u201cA little overdone, but an admirable line of argument all the same, Miss Granger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said with an embarrassed shrug, \u201cmaybe it was a little too much. But the important thing is whether you\u2019re now convinced or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am. I shall support your bill, and I shall speak with some other members of the Wizengamot to encourage them to do likewise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco patted Hermione on the hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you think you\u2019re not good at persuading people in person. I think you\u2019re an excellent debater.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell thank you, Draco,\u201d she said with a blush.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m not sure of,\u201d said Lucius, \u201cis how this helps you personally. These laws wouldn\u2019t have prevented Mr Weasley\u2019s ah\u2026 influence of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sighed. Perhaps not, but it might have saved Harry. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a start. It\u2019s easier to add amendments to an existing law than to introduce a new one. I\u2019m concerned if I push for too much too soon, it will be rejected totally at the outset. And changing society\u2019s opinions takes time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdmirably practical. I shall look over your draft and see what amendments should be made to it now, that would still allow it to pass with majority support,\u201d Lucius said imperiously. \u201cLeave it with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would value your opinion on the matter,\u201d she said politely.</p>\n<p>It was a pleasant drive back to Diagon Alley after that, as they chatted inconsequentially about the musical, especially the costumes and the lighting effects and how they were accomplished. Much more pleasant than the ride <em>there</em> had been, when Hermione had felt like Lucius was angry at being dragged along, and had seemed to be particularly irritated with her personally for some reason.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>Draco toyed unhappily with the salad on his plate at the Crush Room at the Royal Opera House, poking suspiciously at the sliced radish. \u201cIt was supposed to be a romance. H- They said <em>La Traviata</em> was one of the greatest romantic operas of all time. It was <em>depressing</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe music is beautiful, and they do end up at the end. It <em>is</em> widely regarded as romantic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConfessing their love for a few brief moments while Violetta lies <em>dying of illness</em> can hardly be describing as ending up together. And they never even marry. And she was a <em>courtesan</em> and she left him for someone else before their eventual reconciliation,\u201d Draco said with an unhappy scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly because his father disapproved of her, because she was besmirching his family\u2019s reputation so much that his sister\u2019s engagement was threatened. Not because she didn\u2019t love him. She always loved him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco dropped his knife and fork on his plate with a loud clatter, folding his arms sulkily. \u201cWell I hated it. It wasn\u2019t romantic at <em>all</em>. And he threw money at her at the party when he was angry with her like she was a\u2026 woman of negotiable virtue. Alfredo was an arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a <em>tragic</em> romance. It was doomed from the start.\u201d She thought maybe he\u2019d liked it, he\u2019d seemed enraptured while listening to the opera. He\u2019d obviously found it moving \u2013 she\u2019d spotted him crying a couple of times at the most tragic and touching moments, surreptitiously wiping away a few escaping tears. \u201cYou liked the music, at least?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was lovely. Thank you for inviting me. I\u2019m sorry you found it sad, but I thought it was a wonderful last date.\u201d Her upbeat response didn\u2019t seem to do much for his sulky mood, however, and his scowls continued unabated.</p>\n<p>Their waiter stopped by with dessert, and placed in front of her a strawberry-topped pavlova that had been cut into a heart shape, instead of the fruit platter she\u2019d been expecting.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I ordered,\u201d she said with confusion to the waiter, who just smiled and jerked his head meaningfully in Draco\u2019s direction. She glanced across the table at Draco and saw him holding a little velvet box open, to display the stunning emerald ring edged with diamonds nestled inside the box.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione, would you do me the honour of becoming my wife?\u201d he asked stiffly, with a very serious expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>The waiter politely left the bottle of champagne unopened and placed it in an ice bucket, and moved away from the uncomfortable scene. It wasn\u2019t an enthusiastic \u201cyes\u201d from the young lady, and in his limited experience in such rare cases the not-so-happy-couple were best given privacy to talk things over.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s certainly not a joke, for Merlin\u2019s sake!\u201d he said testily. \u201cLook at the ring! Um. That is\u2026 I love you. Please marry me.\u201d An optimistic smile snuck onto his face, as she hesitated uncertainly, and reached out to take the ring box from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said, still unbelieving.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he repeated nervously. \u201cEither you have learnt to love me, as I now love you, and we can build a life together. Or\u2026 you never truly cared at all, and in rejecting me you\u2019ll set me free. You can talk about turning me down for the sake of your career, and how I pressed you to have children you\u2019re not ready for, like we planned. And we\u2019ll have broken up for a good reason that won\u2019t have Potter trying to hex my bollocks off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour parents won\u2019t let us\u2026\u201d she started uncertainly. \u201cYour father has kept you so busy with \u2018urgent business management tasks\u2019 the past few weeks, we\u2019ve hardly even gotten to see each other. He doesn\u2019t even like us dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shook his head emphatically. \u201cMother won\u2019t mind. This was my grandmother\u2019s old wedding ring \u2013 given with her blessing. She just wants to see me married now, and she likes you more than Astoria. Father\u2026 well he will learn to cope. I\u2019m his only son \u2013 if he wants grandchildren he\u2019d better get used to the idea that I\u2019ll be marrying whomever I want. And that\u2019s you, not the Greengrass family, no matter how advantageous the potential business connection. That was never a real love match. Just one of the few pure-blood families we weren\u2019t too closely related to, who were open to an alliance through marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry won\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said, touching the gems gently with a tip of one finger. \u201cHe\u2019ll make me take another antidote.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll believe it,\u201d Draco said confidently, \u201cbecause I got his blessing to propose to you. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to subtly get your parent\u2019s \u2018phone number\u2019 so I could ask your father for your hand in marriage, so I asked Harry for it. He wouldn\u2019t give it to me until I explained why I wanted it, the stubborn idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like him.\u201d Hermione slid the emerald ring onto her finger and stared at it wonderingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Draco asked anxiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking up at him with tears glistening in her eyes, and a smile on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leapt up and pulled her out of her chair to sweep her into a passionate kiss. A few people at nearby tables applauded the happy couple, and the waiter ambled back to their table. It looked like they would need that champagne after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Harry asked, spinning Hermione around as they danced under the glittering crystal chandelier in the Malfoy ballroom. \u201cHow did you get Lucius to cooperate and play the happy father-in-law and agree on terms and sign the marriage contract at last? I thought you were going to stay engaged to Draco <em>forever</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn't that long! Barely over a year. And I threatened him. Discreetly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry laughed. \u201cOf course you did, you blackmailing fiend. What with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dire prospect of a bastard child, and Draco messily forced into an honourless wedding at wandpoint,\u201d she whispered, leaning in close so he could hear in the hubbub of the ballroom full of dancing couples.</p>\n<p>\u201cDear Merlin! Are you expecting? Congratulations!\u201d Harry said, glancing at her flat stomach in her fantastically expensive cream wedding dress robes. There was really far too much silver embroidery and frilly lace on them for Hermione\u2019s tastes, but Narcissa had cried about how she\u2019d never had a daughter to fuss over, and Hermione had eventually caved to perhaps too many of her preferences about the wedding.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it was just a line,\u201d giggled Hermione. \u201cI mean, it <em>could</em> happen. I didn\u2019t say I <em>was</em> pregnant, I just pointed out that I <em>could</em> be. And I talked about how unreliable contraceptive charms are. They\u2019re much less reliable than Muggle methods you know, but Lucius certainly doesn\u2019t know anything about the latter being an option we use. He was desperate for me to stop talking by the end of our chat, as I explained in detail about how if his son didn\u2019t marry me by the end of the year I would vow to <em>raise his bastard Malfoy grandchild in the Muggle world</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry tripped over his own feet, and had to clutch at her shoulder so he didn\u2019t fall over, he was laughing so hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou evil woman! People are photographing us!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be a great snap for the wedding album,\u201d she laughed, catching the bright flash of a wizarding camera out of the corner of her eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe must be quietly fuming!\u201d Harry said with delight. \u201cOr is he angrily shouting?\u201d Harry got along a lot better with Draco these days, but still wasn\u2019t at all fond of his father.</p>\n<p>Hermione spun them back into a waltz and said, \u201cWell, we <em>all</em> shouted at first, except Narcissa I suppose. I found the whole marriage contract thing horrifically patriarchal, but it was important to Draco to stick with wizarding traditions or apparently it wouldn\u2019t feel like a \u2018real\u2019 wedding to him. Lucius has pretty much gotten over it now and is quietly fuming or grudgingly satisfied \u2013 it\u2019s hard to tell the difference but Draco says he\u2019s happier. I think he rather admired my cunning ruthlessness about it all, though he won\u2019t admit it out loud. And I suppose he thinks half-blood grandchildren are better than <em>no</em> grandchildren, which was Draco\u2019s preferred threat of choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed sadly, all his good humour dropping away in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry? Are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cGinny and I are getting a divorce,\u201d Harry said, with resignation rather than sadness.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d Hermione asked tentatively. \u201cDid she\u2026 break her promise?\u201d Surely she wouldn\u2019t dose him with love potions again, after Harry had made the consequences for drugging him again without permission so very clear!</p>\n<p>Harry let go of her waist to flick his hand twice at the two of them with a softly murmured incantation, and a faint background buzzing noise around them told her a Muffliato effect was now up. The media had infringed on Harry\u2019s privacy so many times over the past few years that he\u2019d learnt to master that spell as one of only a rare few he could cast without wielding a wand. She wasn\u2019t at all surprised he cast it \u2013 only that it\u2019d taken him so long to do so.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re probably thinking. No potions added to the cocoa,\u201d he said rather quietly, despite the theoretical security of the anti-eavesdropping charm. \u201cThere were a few things, but the big one was that\u2026 she just couldn\u2019t go through with IVF treatments. She didn\u2019t realise what was involved, and when she did\u2026 well. It was too much for her. She refused. We talked about it a few times and she seemed on-board with it all initially, but she had this big hysterical breakdown eventually and admitted the whole process terrified her and she hated it. She just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could adopt?\u201d Hermione suggested. \u201cI think you\u2019d be a good father.\u201d Harry smiled gratefully at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could. But that\u2019s also something I can do on my own, without her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say it,\u201d Hermione admitted embarrassedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, and I appreciate your discretion,\u201d Harry said, squeezing her hand in thanks. \u201cAnd that you\u2019re trying to be supportive of Ginny and I staying together, like I asked you to be. But it\u2019s over, for sure. I just didn\u2019t want to announce it before your wedding, and steal the media spotlight from the happy couple. You can relax \u2013 we\u2019re definitely through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good,\u201d she sighed happily. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved. That is\u2026 I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m happy, and that it didn\u2019t work out, but I think it\u2019s for the best. But how are <em>you</em> feeling about it Harry? Are you okay?\u201d Her sentences tumbled out rather awkwardly as she tried to hastily backtrack, but luckily he didn\u2019t look offended, just reflective.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 alright. Sadder than I thought I\u2019d be. I really wanted it to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. And you really tried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s broken up about it. I feel especially bad about that. But apart from Ginny, Molly is the only one in the family who can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re separating. Everyone else gets it, to a greater or lesser degree. And Arthur keeps making Ginny cry, without meaning to, by getting distracted by the wonders of Muggle technology and asking prying questions about how IVF works, if you can believe it!\u201d he finished with a laugh.</p>\n<p>Hermione giggled at that. \u201cOh dear, I can just see it now!\u201d</p>\n<p>They whirled about the dance floor for a while longer, both lost in thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright that you\u2019re sitting with her for the reception, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hermione asked at last, breaking the silence with her anxious question.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he said with a nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy?\u201d Hermione asked quietly. \u201cAbout being single again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked pensive as he twirled her around. \u201cNot yet. But I think I might be eventually\u2026 boss.\u201d He grinned as he said the last word, trying to lighten the mood with a joking change of topic.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeard the gossip did you?\u201d Hermione said with a grin of her own.</p>\n<p>\u201cSusan told me. In total confidence. Along with telling half a dozen other people, reportedly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s very excited for me, but the announcement was <em>supposed</em> to wait for when I\u2019m back from my honeymoon,\u201d Hermione said with rueful smile. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how she found out. <em>I </em>didn\u2019t tell her! I promised Kingsley I\u2019d keep it quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement!\u201d Harry said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKingsley wants me to work on eradicating some of the more dreadful pro-pure-blood laws from the end of the war. And he says I\u2019m the best suited for that, though I don\u2019t think I know as much about the laws as many others do,\u201d she said modestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will be <em>amazing</em> at it,\u201d Harry promised. \u201cLook how you pushed that new bill through about regulating poisons and other dangerous magical potions. You got over eighty percent approval for it! It\u2019s practically unprecedented to get that kind of support from both the pure-blood old fogeys and the new blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDifferent arguments for different people,\u201d she said with smug pride. \u201cDraco helped me by going over my drafts. And Narcissa hosted more morning and afternoon tea parties than I ever thought I\u2019d have to suffer through, but you\u2019d be amazed how much you can accomplish chatting with relaxed people stuffed full of cake, compared to dragging them into formal meetings. She\u2019s become quite the social butterfly these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I think you deserve the lion\u2019s share of the credit \u2013 you did so well! The Muggle and Minor Protection Bill paved the way for this new one, and now you\u2019ve got Amortentia almost totally banned \u2013 I\u2019m so proud of you! Ron was angry, unfortunately, and George wasn\u2019t too happy about it either,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut George understood in the end. He and R\u2026 he\u2019s developed some much milder new potions since you\u2019ve gotten the strongest love potions so heavily restricted. You know, I don\u2019t mind that \u2018Second Glance\u2019 one that barely lasts a couple of minutes. It just makes the target pay attention to someone properly, it doesn\u2019t even induce attraction at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know, I heard all about the new range. Apart from official interactions, he wrote me a letter, you know. Apologising for selling love potions at a discount. He\u2019s figured out\u2026\u201d she was speaking quietly already, but still she trailed off to listen for the telltale buzz that the Muffliato was still running, glancing around at the crowded ballroom of whirling couples who might overhear their chatter if it wasn\u2019t. Draco was dancing with Pansy, and he gave her a slightly sappy look when he caught her eye, before the gap in the crowd disappeared and he was lost from sight. He was her <em>husband</em> now \u2013 she could hardly believe it. And she was <em>Hermione Malfoy</em>. Lucius had insisted very stubbornly on the surname change, but in exchange she\u2019d locked in having the final say for any and all educational arrangements for any future little Malfoy children (may that day be far off still!), and a generous monthly stipend of \u201cpin money\u201d from the Malfoy vaults, for her personal expenses. Which if Narcissa had her way would probably be mostly spent on new clothes for the first few months of her marriage, at the very least.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. George and I had a chat about things not so long ago,\u201d said Harry vaguely, with a meaningful look at her that she guessed was intended to hint that she should continue to keep mum about Ginny dosing him. She never <em>had</em> managed to change his mind about going public about that. But she was so very glad they were separating. It made her special day even more wonderful.</p>\n<p>-000-</p>\n<p>In between dinner and dessert, the happy couple circulated through the dining room from table to table, spending a few moments with each of their guests. Their respective parents and close friends had all been greeted first, so now they were mingling more generally.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Hermione cooed, rocking Fleur and Bill\u2019s drowsy infant daughter gently in her arms. She wasn't a newborn anymore, but she was still rather tiny. \u201cHello Victoire! It\u2019s nice to meet you. And I see you\u2019re bucking the Weasley trend and going with blonde like your mummy.\u201d She stroked Victoire\u2019s head gently, the fuzz of blonde hair was incredibly soft, like kitten fur. Victoire let out a tiny yawn, and it was absolutely adorable to hear.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd are you and Draco planning on starting a family soon?\u201d asked Fleur, smiling as she took her baby back to tuck her into her blanket-lined bassinet to nap \u2013 a woven Moses basket that seemed to be a popular choice with pure-bloods for transporting their babies around in the world. Hermione had yet to see a single stroller in the wizarding world that wasn\u2019t pushed by an obviously Muggle parent.</p>\n<p>Hermione sighed gently with frustration. About a dozen people in a row had asked that question, and it was starting to wear on her nerves. She liked babies well enough, but had no urge to hurry up and have one of her own. She was tired of saying, \u201cNo, not yet\u201d and having to justify her answer over and over. It was as if some people found the idea of a woman <em>not</em> wanting to have children right away personally insulting.</p>\n<p>Draco gave her a quick glance, squeezed her hand supportively, and answered for them both. \u201cNot quite yet \u2013 Hermione and I have decided to wait a while. We\u2019d like to focus on our careers in the Ministry and in business for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, perhaps life will surprise you early,\u201d Fleur said with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if that happens, we would be delighted to welcome a child into our lives,\u201d Draco said diplomatically, before changing the subject. \u201cI see Victoire has broken the Weasley trend of red hair, the little rebel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill laughed heartily at that. \u201cThe work of four generations of redheads ruined! But isn\u2019t she adorable? Blonde just like her mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is the sweetest baby I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d agreed Hermione, wrapping her arm around Draco\u2019s waist. He planted a gentle kiss on the top of her head, smiling that sappy smile he\u2019d barely kept off his face for a minute all day as he gazed at her. \u201cIs it due to her Veela ancestry, or just that cute little button nose, do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe button nose,\u201d Fleur said happily, her lingering soft French accent stumbling a little over the first word.</p>\n<p>\u201cVeela powers don\u2019t manifest until the teenage years. We all love her just for being who she is,\u201d Bill said, looking at Hermione rather intently. \u201cHarry asked something a bit similar. And you know, I\u2019m <em>loving</em> being a father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione beamed at him as she realised what he was hinting at \u2013 he loved his daughter. Without any aid of Veela powers or potions, he loved her like a father should. She looked around for Harry, but couldn\u2019t see him, though she saw Ginny chatting with a couple of friends at their assigned table. She guessed this would be their last outing as a theoretically happy couple, if their planned divorce was about to go public.</p>\n<p>With a last wish for wedded bliss from the Weasleys, Hermione and Draco moved on to circulate with their other guests. \u201cHave I mentioned how beautiful you look?\u201d Draco asked her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a dozen times today,\u201d she laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you should know. Just in case you had forgotten. You look absolutely stunning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave I mentioned how handsome you look?\u201d she asked, running her hand along his smoothly shaven jawline.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot nearly often enough. I\u2019m magnificent,\u201d he said arrogantly, making them both laugh. \u201cReady to face the Greengrasses?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Daphne never <em>had</em> quite forgiven her for \u201cstealing\u201d Draco from her sister, and her congratulations were lukewarm and focused mostly on how \u201clucky\u201d Hermione was. But Astoria herself was all politeness on the surface, but with a tinge of cattiness. Of course, she was well positioned to be content, as she\u2019d made a match of her own.</p>\n<p>\u201cErnest and I are so very happy for you,\u201d she said, resting her bejewelled hand on her husband\u2019s where it lay atop the linen-covered table. \u201cIt was such a <em>long</em> engagement some people were wondering if you\u2019d ever marry! Why, Ernest and I were engaged after you, but married first! Still, all good things come to those who wait, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t wait to marry <em>you</em>, my darling,\u201d Ernie said with a happy smile at his wife. \u201cAnd my parents were thrilled to welcome you to the Macmillan family. And I\u2019m so glad you two got married \u2013 what a wonderful thing. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very happy together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd are you planning on having children soon?\u201d Hermione asked, but Astoria didn\u2019t take it as a dig at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes! We\u2019ve even picked out names. Scorpius if it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said, with a smug glance at Draco, \u201cand Morea if it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>After they\u2019d left the table, Draco muttered crossly, \u201cThat was <em>our</em> name. I picked that name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione glanced at him anxiously. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>He let out a huff of breath and let his shoulders relax. \u201cI\u2019m fine. She\u2019s just trying to get to me, but I won\u2019t let her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems a little petty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe could be, sometimes. She argued a fair bit with father and mother, over things both large and small. But some of her arguments you would\u2019ve approved of \u2013 she is actually in favour of a lot of liberal, pro-Muggle-born initiatives. And anyway, I suppose I deserve a little pettiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He swept her into his arms to dip her for a passionate kiss, to the applause of a few at the nearby tables. Narcissa dabbed some happy tears from her eyes as she watched them (her lace-edged hanky had made regular reappearances all evening), chatting contentedly with her sister Andromeda while she juggled young Teddy on her knees, who was insistent about staying awake all night to enjoy all the fun.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Draco let his wife up, laughing and breathless, \u201cNever doubt it. You are the only woman for me, and always will be. We balance each other perfectly.\u201d</p>"
