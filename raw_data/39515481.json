  "text": "<p>Steve is rapidly discovering that Eddie Munson has zero concept of personal space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the months following Vecna\u2019s destruction, Eddie has become a fixed presence in their group. It stands to reason that he\u2019d get on with the kids, having spent a year of high school terrorising Mike, Dustin and Lucas with imaginary monsters, but he and Robin clicked quickly after a rainy afternoon in the quiet video store led to them comparing notes on obscure horror films, and Steve found that the man he\u2019d once considered a complete outcast was actually a real blast to hang out with.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had a sharp sense of humour, quick comebacks and was generous with his stock of weed and with his music collection, which he let Steve rifle through and borrow from after introducing him to Black Sabbath, telling Steve he should really check it out, seeing as he and Ozzy had a mutual hatred of bats. To Steve\u2019s surprise he\u2019d found himself enjoying the heavy guitar lines and knocked on Eddie\u2019s trailer door the next day asking if he had any other albums by the same band.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie had slung an arm around his shoulder, ruffling his hair as he did so, and grinned hugely at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve Harrington, have I managed to corrupt you with Satanic music?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had nudged him in the ribs with a roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, I thought I was going to hate it but Ozzy has some lungs on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie had rubbed his side dramatically, wincing, and ushered Steve into his uncle\u2019s new trailer with a bow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thing was, Eddie\u2019s limbs seemed to draw to people like a magnet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gesture wildly while telling Steve and Robin about the kids\u2019 latest campaign exploits and they\u2019d find themselves dodging hands flying this way and that around their heads. He\u2019d sling his arms around Mike and Dustin as the group of them hung out at the local arcade, with Steve and Eddie often getting roped into supervising and driving the Little Goblins, as Eddie insisted on calling them. Steve had even seen him spin Nancy up into a hug when they waved her and Jonathan off to catch a flight to California, and watched her giggle delightedly as he gently placed her back down, and kissed her hand with a dramatic flourish. Jonathan looked perplexed at the entire exchange, but that could have been a result of the joint Steve had spotted him smoking earlier that day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it wasn\u2019t that he was surprised any more, each time Eddie\u2019s shoulder leant into his as they walked along side by side, or Eddie\u2019s feet landed in his lap as he flopped down onto the beat up sofa in the Wheeler\u2019s basement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem was, Steve was becoming more and more reliant on the little touches and nudges, the warmth of Eddie\u2019s shoulder brushing his, or the scuff of the calluses left by guitar strings on Eddie\u2019s fingers catching in his hair as he ruffled it, to bring his focus squarely onto that point of contact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s parents weren\u2019t the hugging type, and while playing basketball meant he\u2019d spent a lot of time bumping into other guys, his teammates had never offered more than a solid thump on the back after a good game. When he and Nancy had dated, Steve had spent hours with her tucked against him in the dark cinema, or burying his face in her neck, soft hair tickling his eyelids as he\u2019d pressed his lips to her skin, feeling his stomach flip and his chest burn with how much he wanted to be close to her.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they\u2019d broken up, he\u2019d chased that feeling, that spark of heat deep within his chest, longing to find it again with one of the girls that giggled at his flirtatious comments and petted at their hair, blinking up at him, but he\u2019d been left feeling just as hollow with all of them since.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought that maybe Robin would be the one, when they\u2019d started working together, before finding out her secret. Not long after she\u2019d confessed that she liked girls, she\u2019d come to work snappy and terse, and Steve had wheedled it out of her that her crush had started dating a boy whose name he vaguely remembered from their high school. Impulsively he\u2019d grabbed her in an awkward hug, hoping it might comfort her, and she\u2019d wriggled out of it, scrunching her face at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s agree never to do that again, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had nodded firmly. It had been like hugging a squirmy younger sister, if he\u2019d had one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After their experience with the Russians, and the recovery that had followed, Steve had dated less and less. It maybe didn\u2019t help that he\u2019d mostly exhausted the dating pool of ex-Hawkins students and their friends, considering it was a small town, but he found he didn\u2019t have the inclination to try and pretend he\u2019d not been through hell and back while making nice on a date.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So when they were trudging through the Upside Down after encountering the demobats, and Eddie had leaned into him heavily as they bickered back and forth, and something in Steve\u2019s chest sparked quietly into life, he had filed that away to consider when they weren\u2019t in mortal danger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The problem is, now that they aren\u2019t in mortal danger Steve is very much aware that his stomach feels like it\u2019s doing flips when Eddie ruffles his hair, and something glows warmly in his ribcage as they watch nerdy films that Eddie and Robin watch transfixed and Steve pretends to complain about, with Eddie\u2019s calves pressing into his thighs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the months roll by after their ordeal with Vecna, he tries to squash out the feeling. He talks loudly about the girls in the films they watch as he drives Robin home from work, as she cringes and tells him he\u2019s being weird. He flirts shamelessly with the girls that come into the video store, gets a few numbers, but never quite gets around to calling and asking them on a date. He watches a live show of Queen one night, on a rare night that both of his parents are in the house at the same time, and finds himself thinking of Eddie as he watches Brian May play his guitar, long hair swinging gently as he nods his head in time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother is tapping her foot along, sighing quietly as Freddie Mercury struts across the stage in a tight tank top, and his father abruptly stands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe they\u2019re letting people like him parade around like that. Disgusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve watches him march out of the room towards his office, and shrinks into the couch a little more, and as Freddie flings an arm out to gesture, tries not to think of Eddie and his wild hands flying around as he tells his stories.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Steve is drawn to Eddie like a magnet, all the same, because he finds himself outside the trailer once again before long, clutching a couple of records Eddie had pressed into his hands last time he\u2019d swung by to pick up the kids from their dnd night, Dustin calling in one of his \u201cFree Ride\u201d tokens Steve had given him for his birthday, having scribbled the words over ten old arcade tokens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie had grinned as soon as he\u2019d seen him descend to the basement, snagging the records from a bookcase nearby and leaning into his space as he handed them over.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStevie, you\u2019re the only one who will appreciate this music, the infants over there say it\u2019s offending their precious little eardrums.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve broke eye contact before he got caught up in Eddie\u2019s warm brown eyes, and looked down at the record, reading the band name Twisted Sister framed between Eddie\u2019s ring-covered fingers, which brushed against his own.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie squeezed his fingers briefly as he stepped away, strolling back to the table to clear away the dice and figurines that littered it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll want a 3 page essay on why We\u2019re Not Gonna Take It is one of the best songs ever written, due on my desk Monday, Mr Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve cleared his throat quietly before smirking over at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr Munson, you and I both know my academic history is nearly as poor as yours, you\u2019re never getting that essay. I\u2019ll give it a listen tomorrow though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie nodded his head sagely, but whatever he was about to say next was interrupted by Dustin rushing over, saying he needed Steve to deliver him back home before his mom called the police and demanded they form a search party for her baby, who was 25 minutes past curfew.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door to the trailer swings open a couple of moments after Steve knocks, and Eddie beams as he takes in the sight of Steve standing on the step, records in one hand and a six-pack of beers in the other. He steps out, and Steve notices his bare feet peeking out from under his loose, ripped jeans that may have once been black but are now a faded grey. Eddie gives him a brief hug, and Steve feels his hair brush against his nose and cheek, wafting a faint smell of lemon and an underlying hint of smoke from the cigarettes Eddie smokes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo what do I owe this pleasure, my good sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie steps back a little, giving Steve\u2019s shoulders a small squeeze as he releases him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve blinks twice, eyes having closed as he tried not to breathe in the scent of Eddie\u2019s hair too greedily, and shakes his head fractionally, waving the records lamely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI realised I\u2019ve had these a little while, and honestly I\u2019m dying to hear more of Twisted Sister, if you have any more of their stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie practically drags him inside, almost yelling as he does so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it! I knew you\u2019d like them! I\u2019ve got one of their earlier albums, let me find it and we can listen!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they walk through to Eddie\u2019s tiny room, his uncle is shrugging on his jacket in the kitchen area.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods politely, as Eddie\u2019s uncle continues, directing his attention towards his nephew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, kiddo, I\u2019m on a night shift so I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. I know you\u2019re old enough to look after yourself but don\u2019t get trashed, clean up after yourselves if you make food and don\u2019t get old Mrs Rand knocking on the door again telling you to turn your music down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie snaps off a smart salute.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYessir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His uncle chuckles, and ruffles Eddie\u2019s mane of hair as he walked to the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, you little shit.\u201d He says affectionately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie grins back, squeezing the man\u2019s shoulder and waving as he shut the door, turning on his heel to address Steve, who has been watching the easy comfort of their interaction with a pang of jealousy .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In hindsight, getting stoned with Eddie might not have been Steve\u2019s greatest idea, not when he\u2019s trying to play it cool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve worked their way through one joint and then another, blasting Eddie\u2019s music, Eddie trying to copy some of the songs on his guitar, and finally settling into comfortable silence as the trailer gets darker, night falling outside and the glow of a small bedside lamp lighting the room they sprawl in.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve has stretched out, head at the foot of Eddie\u2019s bed and feet at the head, on the insistence of his host that he take the comfortable spot, and Eddie is on the floor, guitar in his lap and his head lolling back against Steve\u2019s thigh. Steve pulls his gaze away from the ceiling and feels the warmth in his chest flare as he sees the puff of Eddie\u2019s hair draped over his leg and the bedspread beneath. Eddie\u2019s profile is silhouetted in the lamplight, eyelashes fanning out underneath his fringe. His fingers are gently strumming across the guitar, left hand pressing into the frets, notes barely breaking the silence. Steve has to choke down on the thoughts the weed is trying to get him to blurt out, before he inadvertently tells Eddie how pretty he is, how much he likes his stupid, gorgeous fluffy hair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if he feels the weight of Steve\u2019s gaze, Eddie tilts his head, meeting Steve\u2019s eyes with his own, pupils wide and glittering in the dark.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve drags his eyes away, looking out the window between the stickers and band flyers Eddie has stuck to it, where he can see the tops of some of the other trailers, and the treeline beyond. Suddenly, the quiet seems too oppressive, and he clears his throat, grabbing at the first conversation topic he can, the comfortable affection of Eddie and his uncle still on his mind, a far cry from his own family.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked how you ended up living here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie sits up a little, lips tugging down a little as he places the guitar down, and Steve regrets his question immediately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, you don\u2019t have to tell me, just\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie shushes him with a lazy pat on his hip, one side of his mouth pulling up into a wry smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Steve, don\u2019t have a coronary. My parents kicked me out right after I failed high school the first time around, and my uncle was the only person in my family I could ask for help. Us black sheep of the family have to stick together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve sits up a little, half reaching to offer Eddie his condolences.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, did they think that would scare you into passing Math?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckles, eyes flicking up to meet Steve\u2019s. Steve sees his Adam\u2019s apple bob as he swallows hard, words coming out in a rush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it was less about the grades, and more about the fact my dad caught me with my hand down Tommy Sawyer\u2019s pants when he\u2019d come over to \u2018study\u2019 one night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s stomach swoops and he stutters.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- um, wha-\u201c</p>\n<p>\n<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>Eddie rubs the back of his neck sheepishly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin said you guys talked about her last year, so I figured, y\u2019know, my secret would be safe with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s head is spinning, and he realises he\u2019s been silent too long.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, yeah, dude, of course!\u201d He hesitates before asking. \u201cCan I- did you always like, know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sees Eddie relax, tension leaving his shoulders as he figures Steve isn\u2019t going to bolt immediately.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I mean I think I always knew. Girls just didn\u2019t do it for me, y\u2019know.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>Never gave me the warm and fuzzies. And my parents had talked about my uncle, Dad told me I\u2019d end up being \u2018trash like that fucking queer\u2019 when he booted me out, so I figured he\u2019d be safe to ask for help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie puts on a booming, exaggerated snarl for his dad, but the laughter doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve reaches out and squeezes his shoulder from his position on the bed, rolling a little onto his side, feeling suddenly more sober. Eddie tilts his head a little until his chin rests on Steve\u2019s fingers, lips quirking a little.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inside Steve\u2019s ribcage js a bright heat, and he replays the phrase \u201cwarm and fuzzies\u201d in his head. This doesn\u2019t feel warm and soft, it\u2019s a burning heat that threatens to engulf him. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie reaches over to the bedside table, plucking the remaining half of the joint they were sharing earlier and offers it out.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>Steve shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI should head home, I\u2019ve got an early shift at the store tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie nods, stretching his legs out and pushing himself up, before offering a hand to Steve, who takes it and levers himself up off the bed. As he stands, he realises how close they are, the limited floor space in Eddie\u2019s bedroom meaning their feet almost touch, Steve\u2019s old basketball socks to Eddie\u2019s bare feet. Steve tears his eyes away from their still-joined hands, and tilts his head up to look at the slightly taller Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie isn\u2019t wearing his characteristic grin, instead staring down at Steve with an almost shy expression. He clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, man, I know I can be a bit, like, full on. If you want me to stop with the-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lifts their clasped hands a little, by way of explanation. Steve blinks, then blurts out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, man, no. It\u2019s cool, really, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The warmth inside him flares again, and he thinks back to the times he didn\u2019t tell Nancy how he felt, to every time he thought might be his last moment in the Upside Down, to the things he wished he\u2019d said and done. Their lives have been at risk so many times, he doesn\u2019t want to regret or miss one more thing, when it might all go to hell again any day.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like it.\u201d Steve looks up at Eddie, whose expression is open and unguarded. \u201cI- I like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s entire face lights up in the darkness, and his hand drops Steve\u2019s. Steve only mourns the loss for a second before Eddie\u2019s hands cup either side of his face and he steps closer, feet either side of Steve\u2019s.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve might have stopped breathing. All he can think of, all he can feel and smell is Eddie, the scent of lemon and smoke again crowding his nostrils, calluses fingers brushing his cheekbones, and he feels his head tilt in a nod.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie doesn\u2019t hesitate, pressing in closer and tilting his head slightly as he slots their mouths together. For a second they stay like that, then Steve\u2019s brain clicks in and his hands come up to Eddie\u2019s hips. This is something he knows, something he\u2019s <em>good</em> at. He parts his lips slightly, tilts his own head a little in response, and the kiss turns from chaste to heated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie rumbles out a quiet groan, and Steve presses his advantage, gently nipping his lower lip, feeling Eddie\u2019s lips part a little in a silent sigh. It\u2019s not much different to kissing girls; Eddie responds to the same things, and lips are lips, when it comes down to it. But also, this is <em>Eddie</em>, and everything is different. He\u2019s a shade taller than Steve, and his hips, where Steve\u2019s hands press into his worn hand tee, are firm, the muscles of his waist shifting in Steve\u2019s hands as Eddie leans in further, brings a hand down from Steve\u2019s face to the back of his neck, fingers sliding into his hair a little as he takes the lead again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They part, chests heaving, and Steve feels like he\u2019s on fire. He expects to open his eyes and see himself glowing, lighting up the room with how heated his skin feels.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s own eyes are dark, pupils blown, and his lips are full and slightly shiny.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>I did that</em>, Steve thinks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A distant part of his mind is screaming <em>Nancy</em>, screaming <em>girls</em>, replaying his father\u2019s scorn over Freddie Mercury, what he might say if he finds out about Steve, but he squashes down that part of his brain and chases the high that is Eddie and Eddie\u2019s mouth and Eddie\u2019s hands, still in his hair as they kiss once more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie kisses lazily, like he\u2019s got all the time in the world. He\u2019s so sweet it could give Steve toothache, gently cupping the base of his skull with one hand, the other trailing down Steve\u2019s neck to rest over his heart, fingers pressing gently over his T-shirt. And Steve, Steve is a gentleman, knows how to charm his dates, when to be soft, but this feels like it has been a long time coming and he wants to press into Eddie, to burrow inside him and wrap around him and dig his claws in a little, keep him close.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reflexively, his hands tighten a little on Eddie\u2019s hips, and he presses the taller man back a little, into the wall crowded with posters, tilting for a better angle to swoop his tongue over his bottom lip and into his mouth, running over Eddie\u2019s teeth as he presses their hips flush.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie pulls away with a rough, stuttering gasp as their crotches press together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Steve, you-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls his hands away from Steve\u2019s hair to scrub a hand roughly over his face, then dips his head to press his forehead to Steve\u2019s shoulder and laugh quietly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a dream, I am not making out with fucking Steve Harrington in my bedroom. I must be higher than I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve lets out a chuckle too.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have many dreams about me, Eds?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie keeps his head pressed into Steve\u2019s collarbone, breath huffing over his heated skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can neither confirm nor deny that without my lawyer present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Steve is grinning, feeling like he\u2019s floating. His eyes drift to the clock on Eddie\u2019s nightstand, blinking the time, 1:08am, and he starts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, man, I actually do need to get some sleep, I\u2019m covering Rob\u2019s 9am tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie sighs, pulls away reluctantly, looking like Steve feels, like he doesn\u2019t want to be apart from Steve for a second. Steve feels instantly bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut look, I\u2019m off tomorrow night, how about you come to the store, we\u2019ll pick one of your horrible horror films, and we can go to mine? My folks are, um, out of town for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s mouth quirks up.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, great! Um, right, I\u2019d better-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaving the trailer is nearly painful, and they awkwardly embrace by the door, mindful of potential nosy neighbours, but Steve carries the warm coals of affection in his chest as he drives home, unlocks the door to his empty house and buries himself in the sheets of his bed, the scent of lemon still lingering around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve is floating on Cloud Nine all day the next day, even having to wake up early to cover Robin\u2019s usual early shift. She joins him in the video store at 2 to cover the latter end of the day, and squints at him suspiciously as she walks to the counter to see him nearly vibrating with energy, desperate to tell her about last night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She listens surprisingly patiently as he runs her through the events of the last night, squealing quietly into her palms as he tells her about the kiss.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, I can\u2019t <em>fucking</em> believe you had your first gay kiss before I did! Actually, scratch that, I absolutely can, you dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grins back, quirking an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say, Rob, I guess my charm never fails.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, ha, asshole.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>Let me remind you of the time you tried and failed to ask me out while we were on the worst comedown known to man. Now go rewind these tapes, lover boy, your nervous energy is making me antsy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She shoos him away to the pile of returned VHS tapes as he sticks his tongue out at her childishly, blowing him a sarcastic kiss.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026\u2026..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The end of Steve\u2019s shift rolls around, and as he glances out of the back room where he\u2019s surrounded by rewound tapes to the clock above the door,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>reading just before 5pm, he spots a familiar figure hopping out of his van across the street and strolling towards the door. Eddie cuts a striking figure, hair blowing in the breeze and customary bandana whipping around his leg. Steve feels his heart jump into his throat as his mouth twitches up into a smile at the sight of Eddie approaching the store. He feels suddenly shy, wonders if this is how the girls he\u2019s dated have felt when he\u2019s turned up to pick them up on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bell above the door jingles as Eddie strolls in, and Steve hears Robin call out to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie! Here to see your boyfriend? Friend! Who is a boy! Shit, Steve, come and save me from being more awkward than usual!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve strolls out, trying to seem casual, like he hasn\u2019t been checking the time every five minutes since his shift started. Eddie is snickering quietly at Robin, who\u2019s head is now buried in her hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, fancy seeing you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Rob. And Steve! Seems like only yesterday, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie grins, toothy and wide, elbows dropping down onto the counter. Steve shrugs out of his Family Video vest and notes Eddie\u2019s eyes dropping down the length of his body as he does so, flicking back up quickly but not quickly enough, and feels his cheeks heat a little. He holds his gaze, though, as Eddie\u2019s eyes track back up to his, and feels himself grin back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. Go on then, pick some weird nerd film I definitely haven\u2019t seen and we\u2019ll order the biggest pizza we can get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie drums his hands on the counter delightedly and straightens, disappearing into the aisles. Steve watches him go, tracking the fluffy hair bobbing along behind the stacks, ducking out of sight as he peers at the videos lower down.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin hops up on the counter, nudging Steve with the toe of her Converse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are gonna be so annoyingly cute.\u201d She mutters.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve opens his mouth to respond when Eddie\u2019s head pops back around the corner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He strides over to Robin, passing her the tape on the far side of her body from Steve, who cranes his head to see. Eddie\u2019s voice makes his head snap back up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh-uh, Stevie, it\u2019s a surprise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin passes it back to him, far less sneakily, but Eddie manages to tuck the cassette into his leather jacket without Steve seeing. He huffs a little, which only makes Eddie grin more, and ducks out from behind the counter towards the door.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Rob, I\u2019ll pick you up Saturday morning, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better, dingus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too, Rob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve and Eddie reach the door and Eddie flings himself dramatically towards it, yanking it open to usher Steve through ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter you, my good sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Munson, you just want to check out my ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie is closer behind than he expected, because his breath ghosts hot over Steve\u2019s ear when he mutters \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d in response. Steve closes his eyes briefly, suppressing a shiver less than successfully, judging by the gleeful look on Eddie\u2019s face when he looks back at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie sticks close as they head over to their respective vehicles.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you to yours then?\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods, fishing his keys out of his pocket.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie glances around, then steps closer, nose almost touching Steve\u2019s hair as his sternum bumps up against Steve\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry not to miss me too much, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s gone, whistling as he struts over to his van. Steve watches him go, tracks the bandana swinging from his pocket, then glances back at the shop window to see Robin nearly crying with laughter at his silent crisis. He flips her the bird and swings himself into his car, resting his head on the warm steering wheel briefly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Russians, alternate universes and six teenagers be damned, Eddie Munson might actually be the death of him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<br>\n</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s van tails Steve\u2019s car most of the way back to his house, which means Steve steals glances at Eddie in his rear view mirror at every stop sign and red light. He\u2019s driven with Eddie several times, and the man is chaos behind the wheel. He blasts music as loud as possible, and Steve watches him headbanging as they wait for a green light, and screaming along to the lyrics.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They pull up to Steve\u2019s huge, empty house and he feels suddenly nervous. Eddie\u2019s been to his a couple of times, delivering the kids for pool time so he and Steve can hang out and make sure none of them drown themselves or each<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0other, but they rarely spend time there alone. Steve shakes himself out of his thoughts and hops out of his car, meeting Eddie at the door. He nearly fumbles his keys under the weight of Eddie\u2019s gaze, cheeks burning.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as they\u2019re in the door Steve turns to Eddie, and they stare at each other for a long moment. Slowly, Eddie reaches out, hooking a finger into Steve\u2019s belt loop, and Steve goes easily, stepping up to him, the toes of his sneakers brushing Eddie\u2019s boots. One of Eddie\u2019s hands comes up to cup his face, and he echoes himself from the night before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods, pressing forwards to fit his lips to Eddie\u2019s, his own hand wrapping around Eddie\u2019s wrist, keeping his hand on his jaw.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They part, sharing the air between them, and Steve tucks his head into Eddie\u2019s neck, Eddie\u2019s hand sliding up into his hair, blunt nails scritching over his scalp as he turns to press his cheek to Steve\u2019s head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you freaking out?\u201d Eddie mumbles into his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. No. A little?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA little is normal. Do you want me to-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it, Stevie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand there, but he feels the nerves and tension bleed out of his body as he matches his breathing to Eddie\u2019s, eyes tingling a little where they\u2019re pressed shut. He slowly pulls away, eyes fixed on Eddie\u2019s jacket collar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, we\u2019re fine. It\u2019s just new, y\u2019know? Well, not new, new. But real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI get you, Stevie. The<em> gay thoughts</em> seem a lot less scary when they\u2019re not accompanied by a real life person in your personal space, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s free hand wiggles, fingers framing the words gay thoughts, in Steve\u2019s peripheral vision and he can\u2019t help but smile, eyes finally flicking back up to meet Eddie\u2019s soft gaze.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I say, Eddie, you\u2019re a scary guy.\u201d He teases.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie scoffs, batting his eyelashes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse you, Harrington, I\u2019m a delight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve straightens fully, reluctantly stepping back out of Eddie\u2019s space enough that he can toe off his sneakers, turning towards the kitchen and staircase.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Mr Delightful, I want a shower and a beer. And then maybe we\u2019ll see how scary you can be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s grin is wicked as he drops to sit cross-legged on the floor, tugging at the laces of his boots and yanking them off to reveal mismatched socks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each with a beer in hand, Steve leads Eddie up to his room, rifling through his drawers to grab a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>clean T-shirt, shorts and underwear out. Hes turning to grab a towel when Eddie speaks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is <em>that</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve glances down to the bottom of his wardrobe, where a blue and white shirt sticks out.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s, um-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Eddie has already leaned down and whipped it out, holding the Scoops Ahoy tee up against his chest gleefully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Stevie, you\u2019ve been holding out on me! How come you never wear this? It\u2019s a real look!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve feels himself flush, scrubbing a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s- yeah, I have no explanation for that. It was a shitty job and I should probably burn that, but hey, I got to meet Robin and nearly get murdered by Russians, so maybe I got a little sentimental and kept it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMurdered by Russians? Man, you guys have a lot to catch me up on next time we all hang out. I have so many damn questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie drops the tee back by the wardrobe, already turning to take in the Polaroids Steve has tucked around his dresser, photos of him and the kids at the arcade, Robin in her band uniform, Nancy and Jonathan hugging Joyce as they headed off on their road trip before college, Eddie in his Hellfire Club tee holding court during a DND session.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve grabs his towel and starts to leave the room.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to snoop.\u201d He stops in the doorway, shooting Eddie a wink.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry not to miss me too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s laughter follows him down the hall.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<br>\n<br>\n</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Freshly showered, Steve walks back into his bedroom, towelling the last of the moisture out of his hair, and stops in the doorway, leaning against it as he takes in Eddie sitting on his bed, deeply engrossed in a Rubik\u2019s cube that Steve\u2019s had sat on his bedside table for months, unsolved. He\u2019s placed his leather jacket on Steve\u2019s chair, and his black tee has been cut into a vest, the armholes cut deep enough to show half of his torso. Steve thinks he can see the edge of one of his tattoos, but drags his eyes back up as Eddie glances up to him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The air punches out of him as Eddie\u2019s dark eyes drag up his body, over the track shorts that Steve knows show off a lot of leg, and the well-washed T-shirt that fits a little tight around his arms and shoulders. Steve walks over, plucking the still-unsolved puzzle out of his hand. He feels powerful, with the way that Eddie is looking at him, tracking his every move. In fact, he\u2019s realising how much Eddie has been watching him over the last few months, how much he\u2019s felt the weight of his gaze, maybe spent more time looking back at him than just friends do.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bold, he leans in, feeling Eddie\u2019s body tense as he presses his lips to the other man\u2019s jaw. Slides his lips over his skin to hover a hair\u2019s breadth from Eddie\u2019s.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s hand darts out, hooking around the back of his knee, and Steve stumbles into him, knee hitting the bed as he half folds into Eddie\u2019s lap. His hands brace on Eddie\u2019s chest, warmth radiating from under his vest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe movie can wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Eddie\u2019s lips are on his and Steve\u2019s mind goes blank as his chest burns white hot with want.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0His hands slide up to grip Eddie\u2019s shoulders as they kiss, fingers slipping under the cutoff sleeves, drifting over his shoulder blades.\u00a0<br>\n<br>\n</span></p>\n<p>\n<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Steve tugs a little on Eddie's shirt, and he pulls back with a smirk, leaning away a little so he can yank the shirt over his head. Steve traces the tattoo on his chest with a finger, then \u00a0 \u00a0presses his hand over the demon head, pushing Eddie to lie back on the bed, glancing up at him through his eyelashes.\u00a0</span><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deftly, Eddie rolls them until he\u2019s kneeling above Steve, thighs pinning Steve\u2019s to the mattress, hands sliding from the waistband of his jeans up under his shirt, dancing over his ribs. He dips in to lick back into Steve\u2019s mouth, who huffs out a laugh, squirming away from the ticklish touch. He opens his eyes to Eddie\u2019s sparkling with humour, as he pulls back from the kiss and trails one hand back down Steve\u2019s ribs, watching with his head cocked a little to the side as he gauges Steve\u2019s reaction. Steve squirms again, hips bucking a little to try and dislodge the taller man, with no luck.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on man, don\u2019t play dirty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie lifts his hand away, smirking a little, eyes crinkling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Stevie, you haven\u2019t seen me play dirty.\u201d He says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He presses back into kiss Steve, teeth catching his lower lip to give it a gentle tug, and Steve feels his hips buck up again for a different reason, desperate for some friction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie sits back to grip the hem of Steve\u2019s t-shirt and tug it up, and Steve lifts his torso a little from the bed to help. He expects Eddie to toss the shirt away but instead he pulls it up as far as Steve\u2019s wrists, then twists it a little around his hands and uses it to pin Steve\u2019s arms above his head with one hand.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s chest pounds, stomach flipping as he stares up at Eddie, watches his shoulder and bicep flex as he presses his fabric-covered hands into the bed. His erection is pressing insistently against his shorts and Eddie must be able to feel it where he\u2019s sat. Steve feels red hot, skin prickling. Instinctively, he flexes his hands a little, gives his wrists a tug where they\u2019re wrapped in the fabric of his shirt.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie watches him carefully, tongue poking out a little at the edge of his kiss-reddened lips, as Steve tests his bonds. The weight of Eddie\u2019s arm keeps the fabric taut enough that he would have to really pull to get out, but he finds he doesn\u2019t want to. He feels safe with Eddie, knows he\u2019s not in a dangerous situation. Even so, his pulse is loud in his ears, and he can feel his adrenaline kicking up.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s voice cuts into his thoughts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis OK, Stevie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs a little, stilling once more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo OK. Just come back down here and kiss me, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you ask so nicely-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie leans in slowly, chest to chest with Steve, the hand not pinning his wrist dipping into the bed at Steve\u2019s side.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kiss, when it comes, is filthier than the last ones have been. Eddie swipes his tongue along the seam of Steve\u2019s lips, and he parts them easily, his own tongue slipping out, tangling with Eddie\u2019s and tracing the tips of his front teeth.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s weight presses down onto him more as he lifts his free hand to run it down Steve\u2019s torso, thumb catching his nipple and tracing over it, nail digging in very lightly. Steve whines, focus narrowing to the sensation, and Eddie does it again, a little rougher, cataloguing his responses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His lips leave Steve\u2019s to nip along his jaw, finding his earlobe and giving it a gentle tug. For a moment Steve thinks he might actually cry, the sensations of Eddie\u2019s teeth pinning him from the single point on his body, his hand still thumbing his peaked nipple, and the weight of his hips pressing into his groin flooding through him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His voice doesn\u2019t sound like his own as it echoes in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hum of Eddie\u2019s quiet response vibrates through his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, hmm, Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- just you. Touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie pulls away, just a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo please this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking- <em>please</em>, Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie rolls away, swinging his leg over Steve to stretch out alongside his body, dipping his hand into the waistband of Steve\u2019s shorts to cup him over his underwear.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve arches, a groan rumbling through him. Eddie palms him a little and he writhes, realising too late that Eddie has let go of the T-shirt wrapping his wrists. He brings his hands down, then stops, looking to Eddie for permission.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie grins, his free hand coming up to help Steve untangle himself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll save that for next time. I think you should touch me too, Stevie. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And god, there\u2019s going to be a next time, there\u2019s going to be so many more next times if Steve has anything to say about it. He pushes his hand into Eddie\u2019s hair, bringing their lips together in something that can barely be called a kiss, just sharing air, lips parted and breathing heavy as Eddie snakes a hand into his underwear to wrap around his cock and squeeze lightly, stroking and rubbing his thumb over the head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Distantly, Steve feels like he should be embarrassed that that\u2019s all it takes to bring him over the edge, as he comes with a broken moan, but it\u2019s been longer than he\u2019d care to admit, and he\u2019s got Eddie in his bed, and it\u2019s perfect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rolls onto his back, chest heaving, burning up, and Eddie slowly retracts his hand. Steve turns his head towards him, and stares as Eddie inspects his hand briefly, then meets Steve\u2019s eyes as he licks the come off his palm, pupils blown and eyelids heavy. Steve\u2019s cock gives a weak twitch. Eddie Munson might actually be the death of him. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve twists onto his side, presses back into Eddie\u2019s space, licks into his mouth and tastes himself, and if that isn\u2019t the hottest thing in his entire fucking life, he doesn\u2019t know what is. He runs his hand down Eddie\u2019s body, wrestling quickly with his belt and unzipping his jeans, pressing his hand against the line of Eddie\u2019s erection.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie nearly growls into Steve\u2019s mouth, hips rolling up, desperate for the friction. Steve captures Eddie\u2019s bottom lip in his teeth, tugging a little.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One of Eddie\u2019s hands twists into the hair at the back of his head, pulling a little, and Steve bites harder. He tries to push his hand a little deeper into Eddie\u2019s jeans but they\u2019re fitted tight to his legs and pull taut across his hips. A little petulantly, Steve releases Eddie\u2019s lip and pulls at his waistband.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie chuckles, releasing Steve briefly to shimmy his jeans and underwear down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, keep your hair on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s retort dies on his tongue as he tries not to stare. Eddie\u2019s cock springs free, bouncing a little off his lower stomach. He reaches for it, then pauses, a better idea coming to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie mistakes his pause for hesitation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, if you don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to blow you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It might be the first time Steve\u2019s seen Eddie struck into silence. His kiss-reddened lips are parted and he stares at Steve dumbly for a moment. Then he flings his head back, one arm coming up to cover his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we one hundred percent sure I\u2019m not dreaming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve is already sliding down between Eddie\u2019s legs. He looks up to find Eddie peeking out from behind his arm. Steve grins, more confidently than he feels, squeezes Eddie\u2019s hip with his hand, then bites the bullet and dips straight in to lick a stripe up the cock in front of him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears a gratifying thump as Eddie\u2019s head slams back into the pillow behind his head, and repeats the move, taking his time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie lets out a muffled groan, and the hand close to Steve\u2019s head on the bed flexes. Steve pushes up onto his elbow and grabs it, pulling it close and resting it on his head. Eddie strokes his still slightly damp hair lightly, then gives it a gentle tug. Steve closes his eyes, scalp tingling, and hums a little, then remembers his task and focuses back on Eddie\u2019s cock.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s had enough people suck his dick that he\u2019s got a pretty strong idea of what works. Feeling bold, he licks his palm and grasps the base, and licks over the head, getting used to the taste. He finds a rhythm that has Eddie swearing above him, and fits his lips over his cock, sucking a little at the head, and then ducking down a little to fit more in. It hits the back of his throat and he feels his eyes sting a little, fighting the urge to cough, and backs off a little, hollowing his cheeks and pumping the length of it as he licks around the head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he runs his tongue over the slit, Eddie\u2019s hand tightens reflexively, pulling a little rougher on his hair, and he groans around his cock. Suddenly Eddie is tensing, crying out a warning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, fuck, I\u2019m-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand in Steve\u2019s hair pulls him back enough that his come stripes across Steve\u2019s lips and jaw, and Steve sits back a little on his elbows, feeling more than a little pleased with himself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie nearly hauls Steve up, grabbing his abandoned cutoff tee to gently wipe away the majority of his come, then presses kisses to his lips, his cheek, his forehead, as Steve collapses half onto him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, you\u2019re fucking perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve preens a little, pressing closer, tucking his nose under Eddie\u2019s chin, just breathing him in.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They lie there, drowsing for a few moments.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve tips his head up to look at Eddie.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve it or not, I did genuinely invite you over to watch a movie, I wasn\u2019t planning to get into your pants this quick-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie shushes him, flaps a hand vaguely.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck the movie, Stevie. The Dark Crystal can wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dark Crystal? Okay, that definitely sounds like a nerd movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie flaps a hand again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBully me later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve huffs a laugh and curls back into him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMm, got you with my nerdy shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTurns out I\u2019m not as cool as I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie squeezes his shoulders a little.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you just as you are, Stevie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
