  "text": "<p>Blaise was immune to whatever it was people usually felt around his mother, for which he was profoundly grateful, since no one needed an Oedipal complex on quite that spectacular a scale, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t have a thorough respect for her gift. So when she paused in the middle of hugging him on the station platform and pushed him out to arm\u2019s length, frowning a bit, and said, \u201cDarling, you must tell me at once: who have you been entertaining yourself with this term?\u201d it didn\u2019t occur to him to lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cLucille Fitzcarrow and Draco Malfoy,\u201d he said immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her; point her out, please,\u201d Mother said. Lucille was with her mother and father not far along the platform. Mother left his trunk where it was and swept over to them, accidentally brushed Mr. Fitzcarrow\u2019s arm and pulled him round. \u201cI beg your pardon\u2014why, you must be Lucille\u2019s parents,\u201d Mother said. \u201cEsther Zabini, a pleasure.\u201d She made a little chit-chat, smiled at Lucille and shook hands with her, and disengaged quickly\u2014Mrs. Fitzcarrow already had that narrow, anxious look coming in her eye, at about the same speed as the faintly glazed one in her husband\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her,\u201d Mother said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure Draco\u2019s the only other one, darling? Has anyone else approached you, perhaps, even if you didn\u2019t take them up on it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise shrugged. \u201cEveryone\u2019s always <em>approaching</em> me.\u201d Mother had picked a really good-looking man to sire him, of course, as well as rich and clever, and even if he didn\u2019t have the gift himself, you could still learn a lot of the techniques. \u201cBut nobody else in particular, not last term.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this will certainly set the cat among the pigeons,\u201d Mother murmured. \u201cAll right, we\u2019d better have a look at Master Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was stalking away from the platform already, pulling his trunk, at his mother\u2019s side. People were eddying out of their way. It was all over the papers, of course, that his father had been arrested yesterday along with an entire pack of Death Eaters, in some enormous disaster of an attack on the Ministry.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, are you <em>sure</em> about this,\u201d Blaise said almost under his breath, as she set an intercept course. There wasn\u2019t going to be any talking to the Malfoys right now without taking a side. Blaise belatedly had to regret the messing around. It made things a bit awkward. Draco wasn\u2019t the sort who\u2019d lower himself to push, of course\u2014he wouldn\u2019t so much as glance in Blaise\u2019s direction again without encouragement. But lack of it would be <em>remembered</em>. Draco held on to grudges like a toddler with an ice cream, and he wanted people to <em>belong</em> to him. He sulked when they unaccountably insisted on signing up for a class he didn\u2019t take or refusing to go out for sweaty pointless Quidditch, much less not taking his side in a war. However, Blaise was entirely prepared to have Draco permanently angry at him rather than walk himself and his mother onto a battlefield.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no help for it, darling,\u201d Mother said, however, and didn\u2019t slacken her pace, so evidently they <em>were</em> taking a side. \u201cNarcissa,\u201d she said, raising her voice a little, and the Malfoys paused and turned. Draco\u2019s face was hard, his mouth turned down, a few bruises along his jaw and his clothes not quite up to snuff. Blaise had heard from Pansy that he\u2019d got into a fight with Potter and his whole crew on board the train, with only Crabbe and Goyle at his back\u2014more stupid than Draco was inclined to be, even where Potter was concerned, but circumstances obviously weren\u2019t calculated for him to be thinking clearly.</p>\n<p>He looked at Blaise, frowning, while Narcissa just held herself stiff and cool. \u201cEsther,\u201d she said. She wasn\u2019t the sort of woman who got anxious around Mother. She was the sort who just brought out the Dark magic and the knives when and if they should ever be called for, and you could always see the suggestion of them lurking under the polite smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long. I hope we\u2019ll see one another over the holidays,\u201d Mother said, offering her hand. Blaise barely controlled a double-take. Draco blinked himself, although Narcissa didn\u2019t so much as bat an eye. \u201cI was so sorry to hear about Lucius. Those people in the Ministry have really begun to get the most extraordinary jumped-up notions. Jackals at the heels of a lion, darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d Narcissa said after a moment, allowing her smile to warm to just a fraction above polite, and took her hand.</p>\n<p>Draco was staring at Blaise, a wary animal sort of hope in his face\u2014obviously wanting the support, and not quite believing in it, which was fair enough, since Blaise himself didn\u2019t believe in it. Hundreds of wizarding families in Britain had someone on this platform right now, and a considerable number of those were <em>watching</em>. Mother might as well be taking out an advertisement in the <em>Prophet</em> announcing her support for the Death Eaters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then she turned and offered her hand to Draco, who reached out to take it, and just before they touched, he jerked back as if she was running a live current. And <em>Mother</em> had pulled her own hand back, too\u2014more controlled, a flinch that Blaise only saw because he was looking for it, but there.</p>\n<p>Mother instantly turned back to Narcissa. \u201cKeep smiling, darling,\u201d she said, very quietly, her own smile fixed in place. \u201cYour son\u2019s in extraordinary danger. If you want him to live to come of age, you\u2019ll come with us right now. Must you go straight home?\u201d she continued, letting her voice rise back to normal levels, something one of the handful of people going past might overhear. \u201cPerhaps you might join us for tea before the journey to Wiltshire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco darted a shocked look at his mother, betraying himself. Narcissa still had that perfect mask in place, but her eyes had hardened. Blaise could see those knives just below the surface now, and they were <em>sharpened</em>. After barely a pause, Narcissa said, \u201cHow kind of you. Shall we take our carriage? It\u2019s waiting just outside, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>She offered it in a faintly challenging way. \u201cCertainly,\u201d Mother said, which got a tiny furrowing of Narcissa\u2019s brow in return, as if she hadn\u2019t expected Mother to accept. \u201cBlaise, darling, go and get your trunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise made a dash for it and came back in a hurry. He didn\u2019t like leaving Mother alone with the Malfoys. Mother rarely cast spells for herself\u2014she said it disrupted her stored power\u2014and while there were plenty of men on the platform, they were with their wives and children and moving, not easily pulled. He liked even less getting into the Malfoys\u2019 enormous coach with them, especially after the smile fell straight off Narcissa\u2019s face the instant the door closed. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d she said, coldly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour son\u2019s an erosmancer,\u201d Mother said.</p>\n<p>Narcissa blinked at her, as if she hadn\u2019t even understood. Draco\u2019s face had screwed up with half-offended confusion. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d he said. \u201cIs this some sort of<em>\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother looked towards him and her eyes filmed over solid white, glowing out of her face, and then she deliberately leaned over and reached a hand out towards Narcissa\u2019s knee. Draco jerked up off his seat so fast he nearly fell, a snarl on his face and a silver wash coming over his eyes\u2014not quite opaque, but visibly shining in the dark of the coach, and put out a hand to bar her.</p>\n<p>Mother sat back at once, letting her eyes fade to normal again, and Draco collapsed back onto his seat gasping and shaking his head, blinking hard. \u201cWhat\u2014what did\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my dear, it was the quickest way to pull it to the surface,\u201d Mother said. \u201cWe\u2019re territorial, you see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa was staring at Draco, shocked. Blaise couldn\u2019t help staring himself, too, although of course he\u2019d already half-guessed, back on the platform. But if erosmancers were one in ten thousand, male ones were one in a million. The Malfoys were an old family though, and so were the Blacks\u2014old and rich and powerful, the sort that a smart erosmancer might choose to ally herself with. It wasn\u2019t impossible that he\u2019d got it from both sides sometime in the last four or five generations.</p>\n<p>Blaise still didn\u2019t understand just why that had made Mother decide to throw herself into the middle of a brewing war, though, and then she turned back to Narcissa. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll forgive me for being quite blunt,\u201d Mother said. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of ridiculous ideas about erosmancy, and you may have quite the wrong notion of what it means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re perfectly capable of finding out what it means ourselves,\u201d Narcissa said. She\u2019d recovered, her face gone hard again; she had put a protective hand on Draco\u2019s arm. \u201cAll I want you to explain right now is how this puts my son in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do one without the other,\u201d Mother said. \u201cYou see, what people misunderstand is that the sex is actually incidental. Any wizard can throw together a sex ritual and raise power. But for most it\u2019s not worthwhile\u2014you can only throw the power into a spell you cast right in the moment, and even then most of the power goes spilling off. Our trick is <em>storing</em> it. And once you\u2019ve got all that lovely power stored up, you can give it to someone to use. It\u2019s most effective if you have someone bonded, but anyone close will do\u2014Blaise, would you mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>He put his wand away. Mother put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cJust a light spell, darling,\u201d she said, and <em>pushed</em>. Blaise swallowed\u2014it was always a bit of a jolt\u2014and then he said, <em>\u201cLumos</em>,\u201d and watched the whole carriage fill with a wincing blaze of light.</p>\n<p>Mother took her hand off and the light faded out. \u201cIt makes us very useful allies, as you can imagine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d Narcissa said, her eyes narrowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Mother added, \u201can untrained and unbonded erosmancer is vulnerable to\u2014exploitation, shall we say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa darted a glance at Draco. He was still glaring at Mother suspiciously\u2014he\u2019d been seething over in the corner ever since she\u2019d pushed him. \u201cAnd just why are you telling us all this?\u201d he spat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, darling,\u201d Mother said, letting a bite into her voice, \u201cif your loyalty to the Dark Lord is so great that you\u2019re <em>willing</em> to spend the rest of a brief life being raped continuously so he can extract staggering amounts of power from you until he burns you out, I suppose I can\u2019t stand in your way, but I would <em>rather</em> he not get the chance to work out the technique. If you think it over, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand why all of us try to discourage that sort of thing. Erosmancy\u2019s hereditary, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Blaise could see Draco was doing his best to pretend everything was perfectly under control and he wasn\u2019t at all terrified to the point of nausea, but it wasn\u2019t working very well. Blaise felt a bit sick himself. Mother had always told him that he\u2019d have to watch any daughters he had, and make sure to get them trained early and properly if they inherited the gift, but she\u2019d never explained exactly <em>why</em>.</p>\n<p>The carriage had brought them straight to the Zabini house. It turned out Lord Voldemort was literally <em>waiting</em> at Malfoy Manor, and already livid about Lucius having got himself arrested. In other words\u2014words that Narcissa didn\u2019t say but all of them understood\u2014not in the least in a mood where he\u2019d be inclined to spare Lucius\u2019s son the charming fate of fueling his complete conquest of Britain. He\u2019d evidently already ordered Narcissa to bring Draco to him for some sort of special assignment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be perfectly frank, I don\u2019t see that you have any choice,\u201d Mother was saying. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s the only one who can protect Draco. The quicker he\u2019s back behind the wards at Hogwarts, the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what price do you suppose the old man will extract for that protection?\u201d Narcissa snapped. She was too controlled to pace, but she was standing column-rigid by the fireplace in their living room with her hands clenched over each other, white-knuckled, her eyes following Draco as <em>he</em> paced. \u201cNot to mention what <em>He</em> will do, when he is victorious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realize this is heresy in your circles, but he isn\u2019t going to defeat Dumbledore overnight, if ever,\u201d Mother said. \u201cIn a year, Draco will be trained and in command of his power, and it won\u2019t be possible to abuse him the same way. If you choose to return to his service then, I doubt his Lordship will cut off his nose to spite his face. As for what price\u2014well, my dear, I think that\u2019s quite obvious. Dumbledore\u2019s going to demand that Draco bond one of his people. But that\u2019s the best protection for him now anyway, and there\u2019s no harm in it either, if you take the long view. After all, the Dark Lord means to kill all of them anyway. In fact, you ought to offer it, with the condition that Draco can take his pick of the candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco whirled round from the window. \u201cYou\u2019re actually suggesting that I\u2014what, <em>fuck</em> one of Dumbledore\u2019s pets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Mother said prosaically, which made Draco gawk a bit, like he\u2019d expected to get a rise out of her over it or something. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry about that part, darling. We\u2019re not like ordinary people, you know. I dare say you\u2019ve already been finding that it all comes naturally to you.\u201d Draco went red, darted a look at his mother, and stopped arguing.</p>\n<p>Blaise could attest to that much from very pleasant personal experience, but the rest of what Mother was saying was outright rot, of course. An erosmancer could shag half a dozen people in a night and call it a pleasant evening among friends, but <em>bonding</em> was no joke. All his life, Mother had been really careful to only take really elderly wizards, who popped off peacefully after a few happy years of overexerting themselves and left her all their money. And even that was rough going for her when she lost them. \u201cAll he wanted was to feel young again,\u201d Mother had wept to him at Uncle Flewellyn\u2019s funeral, six years ago, while the rest of the extended family scowled at her resentfully: he\u2019d left her the current residence. \u201cAt least I could give him that.\u201d Then she\u2019d sobbed without stopping for a week solid and had needed a month lying in dark rooms to recover. All this, even though Flewellyn, despite being a good old fellow Blaise had liked quite well himself, had been a hundred and ninety-six and <em>overdue</em>.</p>\n<p>And that was Mother, who\u2019d never been either sentimental or exceptionally possessive. Draco himself was already inclined to the feudal anyway. Crabbe and Goyle were useless clods who lost house points on a weekly basis: pureblood or not, they would\u2019ve been outcasts in Slytherin if Draco hadn\u2019t rammed them down everyone else\u2019s throats. But they were his loyal vassals, so everyone else was going to put up with them, or else.</p>\n<p>If Draco bonded one of Dumbledore\u2019s overzealous do-gooders\u2014and wasn\u2019t that going to be fun for one of them, getting the full force of a <em>possessive</em> erosmancer centered on them\u2014there definitely wasn\u2019t going to be any convenient switching to Voldemort\u2019s side later on, complete with discarding the inconvenient baggage. If anything, it was going to be the other way round. Draco would probably go spare over the prospect of anyone so much as daring to suggest he give up his prize.</p>\n<p>Which of course was a feature as far as Blaise was concerned. He and Mother certainly didn\u2019t want Voldemort winning <em>now</em>, what with them outright betraying him. He\u2019d been anxious enough the other way round, but at least Dumbledore\u2019s crowd wouldn\u2019t murder you out of <em>spite</em>. The sooner Draco was bonded off to some excessively noble Auror, the better. They could take all that nice power and make themselves a much more compelling target for Voldemort\u2019s wrath than, for instance, a merely interfering erosmancer and her son.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that very sensible plan got derailed as soon as they called Dumbledore. He did at least have the meager wit to recognize exactly how bad it would be for his side if Voldemort got his claws into Draco right now, and promptly whisked them all back to Hogwarts and installed them securely behind the wards. \u201cWe have safehouses where you can be concealed even from Voldemort\u2019s reach,\u201d Dumbledore told Narcissa, \u201cand I will speak with Scrimgeour. There is no sense in keeping Lucius in Azkaban under these circumstances, and likely much danger. We will have him join you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s head jerked up at that, nakedly hopeful, and Narcissa stiffened. \u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d she said coolly. Her hand hadn\u2019t left Draco\u2019s shoulder; it tightened on him visibly. \u201cNaturally, Draco is prepared to\u2014offer his bond to your side, under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p>That of course was when the old idiot said, \u201cThat will not be necessary, Narcissa. I do not propose to force a child into a terrible perversion of what ought to be a natural and joyous partnership. Erosmancy is a rare gift. When Draco enters into a bond to share his life and power with another, it must be by his own free choice. Until then, I will see him protected while he completes his training.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mother</em>,\u201d Blaise said to her in horror, after they\u2019d gone to the apartment Dumbledore had assigned her: she\u2019d be staying at Hogwarts to train Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, darling, utter twaddle,\u201d Mother said grimly. \u201cAnd after <em>we\u2019re</em> already committed. But of course Draco\u2019s not going to give away his bond to one of Dumbledore\u2019s side if he doesn\u2019t <em>have</em> to.\u201d She drummed her fingers on the desk. \u201cUnless we can force the matter. Darling, would you say Draco\u2019s in love with anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise thought about it\u2014he didn\u2019t give much thought to his house mates\u2019 love affairs ordinarily, when his <em>life</em> didn\u2019t depend on them. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said reluctantly. \u201cHe goes with Pansy more than anyone, but I think that\u2019s just him letting the sufficiently attentive subject kneel at the throne, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust as well, the Parkinsons are on the wrong end of things,\u201d Mother said. \u201cDoes he hate anyone? Passionately, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>does</em> he,\u201d Blaise said.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Mother spent the holidays teaching Draco the basics while they waited for the next term to start. She roped Blaise in, since there wasn\u2019t anyone else for Draco to practice on. His job was to sit there saying no while Draco tried to pull him into it\u2014easy enough, since he was immune, even if not particularly fun. Except for the entertainment value of watching Draco get <em>massively annoyed</em> as the weeks went on. Which was quite substantial, actually. Draco had always been ridiculous\u2014he\u2019d never been trained out of the idea that anything nice really <em>ought</em> to belong to him, and it was some sort of oversight if it didn\u2019t\u2014but now his territorial instincts were sending him completely out of his head. And Blaise had shagged him a couple of times last term, so Blaise ought to be his, body, mind, and soul, and Draco couldn\u2019t bear that he was refusing to acknowledge that obvious fact.</p>\n<p>About a week before term started, Draco started really getting impatient and snarled at Mother, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t <em>feel it</em>, what\u2019s the <em>point</em>, I\u2019m not wasting my time any further!\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother just said in her most cool, bored tones, \u201cDarling, don\u2019t fuss, it\u2019s the <em>practice</em> that matters. Try again, do,\u201d and Draco flushed up furiously and whirled on Blaise and his eyes went solid mercury and then he said, \u201c<em>Honestly</em>, Blaise, aren\u2019t you getting <em>bored</em>? Let\u2019s just forget all this and go and have a shag for the <em>hell</em> of it,\u201d which to be fair made perfect sense, and Blaise <em>was</em> rather in the mood. Irritation looked particularly good on Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d he said, standing up, and then Mother snapped, \u201c<em>That\u2019s enough!\u201d</em> and her hand was on Blaise\u2019s shoulder, jerking him away just before Draco touched him.</p>\n<p>Blaise shook himself and stared at Draco, shocked. Draco was busy glaring furiously silver-eyed at Mother. Her hand was claw-tight on Blaise\u2019s shoulder, gripping hard enough to hurt. \u201cWell done, darling,\u201d she said to Draco after a moment. Blaise could hear the tension in her voice; she was fighting to sound cool. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see if you can back off on the pull. Deep breaths, please. You might need to close your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco just stood there a moment longer with his hands clenched, shivering, and then he did shut his eyes, and started breathing deeply. Mother relaxed after a few minutes, just as he opened his eyes and was back to normal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid Blaise won\u2019t be able to help us any more,\u201d Mother said in calm tones that Blaise could tell were entirely artificial. \u201cBut fortunately, the rest of your classmates will be arriving next week, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a volunteer or two to assist us. Why don\u2019t you take the week as a holiday, and we\u2019ll begin again after classes start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did he <em>do</em> that?\u201d Blaise demanded, as soon as Draco had stalked out the door after one last lingering look in his direction that made something shiver pleasantly in Blaise\u2019s gut. \u201cI thought I was <em>immune</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother had sat down and was summoning up a pot of tea, which meant she still felt ruffled herself; she poured Blaise a cup, too. \u201cIt\u2019s my power that protects you,\u201d she said, low. \u201cAnd it seems\u2014his is greater. Male erosmancers are supposed to be extremely strong, but I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t quite anticipate the degree. I\u2019m sorry, darling, you\u2019d better not mess about with him recreationally anymore, and I\u2019ll give you a protective amulet in case he decides to have another go at you. The last thing I want is to provoke a territorial dispute with him. He might rush off the grounds and straight into the Dark Lord\u2019s arms.\u201d She sat back with her cup of tea and sighed. \u201cThe sooner we have him bound up, the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco <em>did</em> have another go that afternoon, down in the Slytherin common room. The amulet worked, although Blaise had to admit his own inclinations weren\u2019t helping. He could tell it would be <em>stupendous</em>. When an erosmancer promised you a good time, they <em>kept </em>the promise, and frankly, it\u2019d been a good time even <em>before</em> Draco\u2019s full powers had woken up. \u201cUgh, Malfoy, don\u2019t make it <em>worse</em>,\u201d he said however, because <em>he</em> wasn\u2019t an idiot. \u201cThe last thing we need is for you and Mother to end up in a territorial squabble over me. Do you <em>want</em> to end up chained in a dungeon at You-Know-Who\u2019s tender mercies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco shuddered a bit, involuntarily, and sulkily threw himself into one of the armchairs. \u201cI\u2019m going <em>mad</em>,\u201d he whined, letting his head fall back. \u201cShe\u2019s had me slaving at it for months, and the first time I can really use it, there\u2019s no one to use it <em>on</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s always Filch,\u201d Blaise said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to make me vomit or something?\u201d Draco demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr Hagrid\u2019s out there on the grounds, I suppose,\u201d Blaise added in thoughtful tones. \u201cOh, and of course, there\u2019s always Dumbledore. Mother says she can\u2019t pull him because he\u2019s gay, but I bet you could land him in a minute\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZabini, I take it back, I wouldn\u2019t shag you if you got on bended knee and <em>begged</em>,\u201d Draco said, glaring.</p>\n<p>So that got them a bit of breathing room, and six days later the rest of the students all showed up at last, streaming into the hall like a rescuing tide. But Crabbe and Goyle both made a bee-line straight for Draco, and they slipped him a letter, which couldn\u2019t be good. Voldemort probably hadn\u2019t been able to work out yet exactly what was going on\u2014Mother had hoped that he might think that Lucius had cut a deal with Dumbledore for his freedom, which would only have made him angrier with the Malfoys. But if the letter was <em>what\u2019s the matter, all will be forgiven, only come back to the fold</em>, and Draco decided to spill the beans to the Troll Twins, the <em>next</em> letter was certainly going to be <em>how could you imagine I would ever treat the child of my ally with such cruelty, your place is by my side, Draco Malfoy, we\u2019ll conquer all the world together and I will heap honors upon you</em> etcetera.</p>\n<p>Draco wasn\u2019t going to swallow the bait instantly and hand himself over, he wasn\u2019t <em>stupid</em>, but the offer would certainly be to his taste. Mother thought Voldemort couldn\u2019t bond himself\u2014\u201cI met him once, darling, before you were born, and there\u2019s nothing in him to pull. I think he\u2019s dislocated his soul somehow,\u201d which sounded uncomfortable\u2014but that only made things worse. If Draco had the bright idea to bond, say, Crabbe or Goyle, to protect himself\u2026Blaise grimaced at the thought, which certainly wouldn\u2019t appeal to anyone of taste. But there wasn\u2019t going to be any way to <em>stop</em> Draco if he decided to take the plunge, and Voldemort wouldn\u2019t even object. You could still give power to other wizards even if you were bound to another one in particular, it was just easier if you had the direct line.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Potter was over at the Gryffindor tables with his mates, scowling over at them. Blaise nudged Draco. \u201c<em>Someone</em> isn\u2019t happy to see you,\u201d he murmured, and Draco promptly turned away from whispering with Crabbe and looked right back at Potter, his own eyes narrowing. They spent the rest of dinner glaring at each other the way they always did, which for once Blaise found a tremendous relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we\u2019d best move quickly,\u201d Mother said, when he reported to her that night. \u201cHow difficult do you think it will be to get Harry in here for one of our training sessions?\u201d</p>\n<p>As it turned out, not at all: Harry literally turned up at their first new training session the very next day, like he didn\u2019t have anything more urgent to do on the first day of class but follow Draco round the castle. He was wearing his Invisibility Cloak while he did it, but that sort of thing couldn\u2019t hide a teenage boy from Mother; she opened the door and paused, looking into the hallway behind Draco\u2019s back narrowly, and then said to a patch of thin air, \u201cDear, it\u2019s quite rude to skulk about,\u201d in a mildly reproving tone. Draco jerked round as the air gave a sort of guilty twitch. \u201cBesides,\u201d Mother added, \u201cthere\u2019s no need. You\u2019re quite welcome, if you\u2019re curious. We need volunteers, as you can see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slowly pulled off the cloak, looking wary. \u201cNot <em>him!</em>\u201d Draco said to Mother.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhyever not, darling?\u201d Mother said innocently.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>Harry Potter!</em>\u201d Draco hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre the two of you particular friends?\u201d Mother asked. \u201cHave you ever had sex before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes popped. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d he said, just as Draco yelled, \u201c<em>No!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Mother said, and held open the door. \u201cCome along, both of you. Thank you, darlings, we\u2019ll try the two of you next week,\u201d Mother added to Pansy and Crabbe, who were the ones Draco had brought along, and waved them off. \u201cBlaise, you\u2019ll come and be our control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am <em>not</em> going to\u2014not <em>Potter!</em>\u201d Draco snarled.</p>\n<p>\u201cDarling, that is exactly what makes him the challenge you need,\u201d Mother said in lecturing tones. Harry was darting a look down the hall like he was considering a run for it, but Mother crooked a finger at him and said, \u201cRight in here, darling, take a seat on the sofa. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d a gentle suggesting pull in the words, and Harry\u2019s eyes unfocused a bit and he came in.</p>\n<p>For all Draco\u2019s objections, what he actually <em>did</em> was flush angrily, then stalk into the room right on his heels and plant himself in front of the sofa, blocking Mother\u2019s view of Harry and glaring at her. Mother kept her expression serene, but Blaise could tell she was highly pleased. They couldn\u2019t have asked for better: Harry was evidently lured <em>and</em> Draco was already territorial over him, even if he was snapping, \u201cIf you imagine I\u2019m going to give <em>Potter</em> a go\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Harry woke back up at that and shot to his feet. \u201cGive me a\u2014<em>what?</em> With <em>Malfoy? </em>Not if he put a wand to my throat\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d want to get <em>close enough</em>,\u201d Draco hissed, turning on him. And yet somehow they\u2019d both managed to end up in spitting distance of each other, again.</p>\n<p>Mother clapped her hands, beaming upon them both as they jerked back round. \u201cSplendid! Please keep that up, Harry, that\u2019s exactly right. <em>Very</em> helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said, darting a sideways look at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Draco, really, there\u2019s no need to be alarmed,\u201d Mother continued blithely to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be <em>able</em> to pull someone who actively dislikes you, not yet\u2014that\u2019s <em>very</em> advanced erosmancy and takes <em>enormous</em> power,\u201d ladling it on a bit thick, Blaise would have said, but Draco scowled. \u201cNow, go on, darling, just give it a <em>try</em>. Just imagine that\u2014oh, that Harry here is <em>rejecting</em> you, how dare he\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a shot at random\u2014Blaise had filled her in quite thoroughly on their shared history, of course, which he himself knew about because Draco had recounted it with violent rancor at least a dozen times over the last six years. And then Harry helped things along by folding his arms and saying in the most snide way possible, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to <em>imagine</em> too hard or anything, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco whirled on him, silver climbing over his eyes. \u201cAs if you wouldn\u2019t be pathetically grateful if I <em>wanted</em> you, Potter.\u201d His breath was coming in furious pants. \u201cNo one ever <em>has</em>, have they\u2014<em>no one\u2019s</em> ever wanted you,\u201d he spat, and then he stopped short with a sudden wondering expression dawning over him as Harry flinched back violently, his whole face as dazed and wounded as if someone had just cut him wide open, straight across the front.</p>\n<p>Blaise gawked. He\u2019d seen his mother pull people before, tugging out the needs in them that she could answer, but he\u2019d never seen anyone hooked that <em>deep</em>. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him at all\u2014Harry Potter, of all the people to feel <em>unwanted</em>, with half the wizarding world ready to hoist him to their shoulders as a savior\u2014</p>\n<p>Draco took a step towards Harry, reeling in his catch. His own face was coming alight, <em>dazzled</em>; his eyes were shining so strongly they were casting shadows on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it. No one at all\u2014no one\u2019s ever <em>really</em> wanted you,\u201d he breathed out, obviously feeling the line taut in his hands. \u201cThey all <em>admire</em> you, or want things <em>of</em> you\u2014not <em>Dumbledore</em>, he doesn\u2019t want <em>you</em>, he wants <em>the Boy Who Lived</em>, isn\u2019t that right? No one wants all of you. Not even your best mates, your best friends\u2014they want each other more than they want you. Not even your <em>family\u2014</em>? Oh\u2014oh, they <em>don\u2019t</em>, do they. They can\u2019t even <em>stand</em> you. Your own parents\u2014<em>left you</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked <em>gutted</em>, his jaw clenched tight over agony, like Draco was pulling his innards out of him. \u201cShut up,\u201d he rasped out, his voice raw and barely over a whisper. \u201cShut <em>up</em>, you don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t understand <em>anything\u2014</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> don\u2019t understand anything,\u201d Draco said, and his voice was changing, going low and soft and liquid, so deeply potent that Blaise felt shivers running up and down his own spine. \u201c<em>I</em> want you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s mouth stopped on a breath, half-open, as he made the mistake of locking onto Draco\u2019s eyes. His pupils caught silver reflections, going glassy as Draco took another step towards him, slow and cautious and prowling, closing the trap on them both. They both looked transfixed. \u201c<em>I</em> want all of you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you <em>all along</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes were almost too bright to look at now, even from the side, but Harry was frozen, fixed on him completely, not even blinking. There were <em>tears</em> sliding from the corners of his eyes. Draco was on him, sliding his hands into Harry\u2019s hair, taking hold of his head, and Harry just shut his eyes, shivering, and tilted his own head up invitingly for the first kiss, the second, the third. Blaise was finding it hard to breathe himself, watching.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to <em>own </em>you,\u201d Draco said, almost a moan, between kisses, nipping at his mouth. \u201cI want <em>everything</em>\u2014why haven\u2019t you <em>let me</em>,\u201d reproachfully, nuzzling at Harry\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>Harry groaned and actually said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t <em>know</em>, <em>Draco</em>,\u201d and then he started grabbing at Draco\u2019s clothes, clumsily but with total determination.</p>\n<p>Draco had no problem with clumsiness: he ran a single finger down the front of Harry\u2019s robes, and they all opened themselves up and fell off him obligingly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve <em>got</em> you now,\u201d he said, sounding <em>intoxicated</em>, sliding his arms round Harry\u2019s body, stroking his hands all over him. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve no <em>idea</em> what it\u2019s going to be like. I\u2019m going to have <em>everything</em>. Every part of you,\u201d and he was catching Harry\u2019s hand in his, bringing it to his mouth, taking the top of the little finger into his mouth for a slow lingering taste. Harry\u2019s head rolled through a wide wobbly circle like his neck couldn\u2019t hold it up straight, his eyes gone utterly glazed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m <em>never</em> going to let go,\u201d Draco said, vowing, almost savagely. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you so much power no one\u2019s <em>ever</em> going to be able to part us, ever,\u201d and he pressed a kiss into Harry\u2019s palm, and on pure instinct somehow managed to push him a taste of power <em>with</em> it. Harry cried out, shaking through waves of shudders, and as soon as he caught his breath with three enormous gasps, he seized Draco and dragged him towards the sofa. Everything was going magnificently, and then out of nowhere, Mother said very loudly, \u201cDarlings, I don\u2019t think\u2014boys, you mustn\u2019t\u2014Draco, you must stop at once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise stared at her. She wasn\u2019t actually doing anything to stop them, of course, but he couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying it for, and then the door flew open and Dumbledore rushed in.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlbus, they\u2019ve got to be separated at once or they\u2019ll bond, but I can\u2019t touch Draco,\u201d Mother said quickly to him, her hands held out ineffectually towards the two of them as if she <em>wanted</em> to stop it, but she just couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore shot a hard look at her, but he went to Harry at once anyway. \u201cGet away, he\u2019s <em>mine</em>,\u201d Draco snarled at him, pulling Harry closer, and Harry himself said furiously, \u201cNo!\u201d and shoved back when Dumbledore tried to draw him away, clinging to Draco just as determinedly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Somnolens</em>,\u201d Dumbledore said, and both of them blinked and sagged slowly to the floor, unconscious and still in a tangle.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Albus,\u201d Mother said to him in asperity, as she sent Blaise over to drag Draco away, which wasn\u2019t easy, because even asleep he tried to keep clutching Harry tight, \u201cI gather that when you told Narcissa you\u2019d wait for Draco to make a perfectly free choice, what you meant was, of <em>Harry Potter</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore was kneeling by Harry. He looked up at her, and after a moment he said, \u201cI cannot claim to have had any such insight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had them under your eye for five years, and you\u2019ve never noticed <em>that?</em>\u201d Mother said in tones of deep skepticism. \u201cThat was an Antagonist Binding they were about to form\u2014their fundamental needs are perfect opposites! They must have been fighting like cats and dogs since the first minute they walked in the doors. And you didn\u2019t think it worth mentioning? Seconds from bonding, in a minor training exercise\u2014I dare say it\u2019s going to be all but impossible to keep them from finishing the job. What Narcissa will say to me, I don\u2019t like to think.\u201d</p>\n<p>The best defense was a good attack, Mother always liked to say, and Dumbledore did pause, frowning, as he looked down at them. \u201cIf so,\u201d he said finally, \u201cit must still be their <em>conscious</em> choice, not an accidental one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now that I <em>know</em> about it, I\u2019ll certainly be sure not to let Harry into our training sessions again,\u201d Mother said coolly. \u201cPerhaps you might take him away at once: it would be best if they didn\u2019t wake up together.\u201d Dumbledore was still frowning as he floated Harry out of the room, obviously dissatisfied, but not quite ready to accuse Mother of anything.</p>\n<p>As soon as he was gone, Mother waved her wand over Draco. \u201c<em>Finite Incantatem</em>,\u201d she said, and he came awake and up on his feet with a jerk, looking round wildly before he wheeled on her flushed and panting, his robes half hanging off one bare shoulder and threatening to slide further.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Where is he?</em>\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhere did you <em>take</em> him, he\u2019s <em>mine</em>,\u201d taking a step towards her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything, darling, <em>do</em> calm down,\u201d Mother said. \u201cDumbledore took him back to his dormitory. But you didn\u2019t want him <em>really,</em> did you?\u201d she added, as Draco clenched his fists. \u201cWhich is just as well\u2014it\u2019s not like Dumbledore\u2019s going to let you have <em>his</em> golden boy, of course,\u201d with just a hint of emphasis, and Draco stood there trembling for a solid five minutes of jealous rage before the silver left his eyes.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cAs setbacks go, darling, it\u2019s not a bad one,\u201d Mother said, after Draco had got hold of himself and put his clothes straight and cleared out, announcing that he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d set him on <em>Harry Potter</em> of all people, as though he\u2019d ever <em>lower</em> himself so, and it was an <em>outrage</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be happier to have them sewn up properly, but I think they\u2019ll be very cooperative the rest of the way,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen quite such a perfect fit between hungers. Draco\u2019s just starving for total possession, and evidently Harry Potter is equally starving to <em>be </em>completely possessed. It wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me either, but there you have it. And they seem to be a match on power as well\u2014of course Harry has quite a compelling need for more power, but evidently Draco\u2019s just as eager to <em>give</em> it to him. Is Harry everything the rumors have it? I\u2019ve always assumed his reputation would be quite inflated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how talented he is, exactly\u2014he\u2019s not a shining star in class or anything,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cBut he ran a duelling school underground last year, for the other students, and he\u2019s absolutely deadly as Seeker\u2014I suppose it\u2019s massive reflexes or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d Mother said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really ask for better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise went into Potions class the next day with orders to try and nudge things along if he could. The opportunity wasn\u2019t immediately obvious, because Harry kept his head bent over his station and didn\u2019t so much as look up even when he was called on, just mumbled some wrong answer and took Snape\u2019s points-off-Gryffindor in silence, his whole back and neck held rigidly so he couldn\u2019t possibly turn his head and sneak a look over at Draco, who for his part stared fixedly at Harry the entire class. That wasn\u2019t really anything new, but the <em>degree</em> of the phenomenon was, since he completely forgot about doing any of his work and when Snape came by at the end of class, Draco jolted out of his mesmerized state and just stared up at him blankly when Snape asked where his potion was. Snape stared down, obviously expecting <em>some</em> sort of answer, and when he got none said rather indignantly, \u201cI will see you for <em>detention</em> tonight, Mr. Malfoy, and you can make it up then.\u201d</p>\n<p>He started to turn round to the Gryffindor side. Blaise immediately dropped his wand to the floor and bent down to get it, and as he came up aimed a subtle jinx at Potter\u2019s cauldron and made it tip forward, spilling all over his station. \u201cDetention for you<em> as well</em>, Mr. Potter,\u201d Snape hissed at Harry, who looked up from wiping up the mess and then involuntarily glanced over at Draco\u2014</p>\n<p>He jerked his head back away looking dazed, while Draco\u2019s eyes had gone distinctly shimmering, so Blaise congratulated himself on a job well done, then grabbed a handful of ingredients off his station and threw them into his own cauldron. It promptly erupted. Snape was looking murderous as he ordered Blaise to detention as well\u2014and then on the other side of the room, Granger said loudly, \u201cWell, perhaps if we\u2019d been told to prepare it with the <em>hucklethorn</em> base, half the class wouldn\u2019t have had trouble,\u201d and Blaise scowled as she got detention, too\u2014especially as she was looking right at him, with cold narrowed eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what game you and Malfoy think you\u2019re playing, Zabini, but you\u2019re not getting anywhere with it,\u201d she hissed to him in the corridor as they spilled out. \u201cCome on, Harry, we\u2019ve got to get to Charms,\u201d she said, turning away and taking Potter by the arm and pulling him away, Ron Weasley scowling protectively at their heels, while Crabbe and Goyle kept their stupid lumbering selves blocking Draco\u2019s line of sight to him.</p>\n<p>Draco was sulky after, which was something, but not much consolation when Blaise headed to the common room after lunch and overheard Pansy murmuring, \u201cOoo, Draco, aren\u2019t male erosmancers <em>really</em> rare?\u201d Draco was sitting with her and Crabbe and Goyle in the corner, smirking with obvious satisfaction and making Pansy go heavy-lidded and nearly orgasmic just by stroking a finger along the back of her neck, so the cat was thoroughly out of the bag there.</p>\n<p>Blaise counted on detention, but it didn\u2019t work. Granger planted herself between Harry and them and kept talking to him quietly the whole time, doing half his potion for him. Draco did his own with a cold furious expression the entire time, as if he was angry that Potter wasn\u2019t coming over and throwing himself at him. He probably was, the unreasonable bastard. Blaise finally tried to push things: he nudged Draco and murmured, \u201cDo you think Potter told Granger all about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, that all it took was one little tug and he was ready to bend over for me like a whore?\u201d Draco snapped viciously, loud enough to be overheard. Potter flinched, and his jaw tightened as Hermione darted a startled look over and back at him.</p>\n<p>They came out into the corridor after, and Potter abruptly halted and turned round to face them. Draco stopped short, staring at him, his face going hungry, and Harry swallowed visibly, his throat working. When he spoke, his voice shook, but what he said was, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you did to me, Malfoy, but you know what, it doesn\u2019t count. It\u2019s not anything real. It\u2019s what we <em>choose</em> that matters, and I wouldn\u2019t choose <em>you</em> if\u2014if my <em>life</em> depended on it,\u201d before he turned and walked away with his head bent and Granger at his side, and bully for him, since <em>it</em> <em>probably did</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco whirled away snarling, \u201cAs if I\u2019d let that pathetic halfblood wanker anywhere <em>near</em> me,\u201d and stormed back to the Slytherin dungeons. When he burst into the common room, he stood on the threshold panting and swept his gaze round the place, killing every conversation dead. All the girls in the room turned to stare at him\u2014even the queer ones\u2014along with a good three-quarters of the boys. Draco stood there a moment, trembling, his fists clenched, and then he stalked through the room. He glanced at Pansy as he went, and also at Wanda Rowlands and Jeremy Talbot, barely a flick of his eyes, and all of them got straight up and followed him down the corridor to the dorms.</p>\n<p>Blaise groaned and let himself fall into an armchair, where he\u2019d probably be sleeping that night. <em>Shit</em>.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>If anyone in the entire school hadn\u2019t yet noticed what was going on with Draco, there wasn\u2019t any missing it by the next morning. He was practically <em>advertising</em>, like an enormous billboard flashing: <em>endless torrents of power and also all the sex you could ever want, on offer right here!</em> Everyone at the Slytherin table who was old enough to have a sex drive was glaring hatefully at everyone else, with special rancor reserved for the three Draco had pulled last night, who were the only ones not glaring because they were all but toppling into their porridge.</p>\n<p>Even people at the Gryffindor tables were staring hungrily over, except <em>not</em> Potter, who had sat down with his back to the Slytherin tables and didn\u2019t so much as lift his head from over his plate the entire meal. Blaise looked over at Mother in alarm. She was sitting at the head table and talking with Madame Hooch with a serene expression on, but when she met his eyes, he could tell she was just as concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter <em>rejected</em> him?\u201d she said, when Blaise managed to get away and get to her in private. \u201cWonderful. And Voldemort\u2019s certainly going to know everything before the end of the day, if he doesn\u2019t already.\u201d She folded her arms and stood tapping her foot. Abruptly she said, \u201cDumbledore may be a romantic idiot, but not everyone on this side is, you can be sure of <em>that</em>. I\u2019ll write to Scrimgeour and see if I can\u2019t persuade <em>him</em> that Draco\u2019s got to be forced to bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Draco came for his training session that day, Pansy was with him, clinging to his arm and still wearing a look of smug satisfaction. \u201cVery good, darling, you\u2019ve been practicing,\u201d Mother said to Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to learn how to do that thing again, the one you did with Blaise,\u201d Draco said imperiously. \u201cWhen you gave him the power.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Mother didn\u2019t want to teach him anything of the sort, but she said thoughtfully, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early in your training, but I suppose it\u2019s all right to give it a try,\u201d and had him light Pansy up, which made her squeal a bit, and then look even <em>more</em> smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, darling,\u201d Mother murmured to Draco on his way out, catching him when Pansy had left the room, \u201c<em>do</em> keep in mind that not all wizards are powerful enough to be worthy of an erosmancer\u2019s strength. You can\u2019t make a teacup bigger by filling it from a gallon jug.\u201d Draco frowned at her. \u201cAlso, it would be best if you don\u2019t do too much power-sharing yet,\u201d she added. \u201cEventually, of course, the goal is for you to develop conscious control over the flow of power. But until you reach that stage, opening the pathways only makes it easier to\u2014well. To take the power against your will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco repressed a shudder and shot out of the room in a hurry.</p>\n<p>Mother was frowning after him as soon as the door closed, though. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen for long. His instincts are pushing him too hard. And I doubt it\u2019ll take him more than a week of practice to establish total control over the flow. He\u2019s just far too strong. Oh! What a relentless <em>idiot</em> Dumbledore is. As if his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t be deliriously happy right now, not to mention enormously more powerful, if he\u2019d only waited ten more minutes to come in.\u201d She looked at Blaise. \u201cIs it worth telling <em>Harry</em> so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d Blaise said. \u201cI doubt it. He\u2019s got the self-preservation of a lemming as far as I\u2019ve ever noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, he\u2019s one of those Gryffindor sorts,\u201d Mother murmured. \u201cAll right, no, he won\u2019t do it to save himself, will he? He\u2019ll do it to save <em>Draco</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to believe anything you say why exactly?\u201d Potter had his arms folded across his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re <em>on the same side</em>,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cYou do understand there are <em>sides</em> here, right? There\u2019s <em>his</em> side, and they want us all dead<em>?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the sides straight, thanks,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is when you landed on ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother got Draco away from him!\u201d Blaise said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when does Draco need to be <em>rescued</em> from Voldemort? His dad is <em>one</em> of them!\u201d Harry snapped. \u201cHis aunt murdered Sirius!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, this conversation\u2019s going to take a lot longer if you insist on pretending you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with Draco,\u201d Blaise said, doing his best to sound like Harry was an idiot who didn\u2019t understand the basics as well as any child. That sort of thing always worked well on Muggle-raised wizards.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an erosmancer! If You-Know-Who gets hold of him before he\u2019s bonded, he\u2019s going to spend the rest of his life being gang-raped in <em>shifts</em> so the Dark Lord can raise power on his back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him in stark horror. \u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut nevermind, he deserves it because his family picked the wrong side for him to be born on, is that it? Right, sorry for <em>bothering</em> you,\u201d and Blaise turned to walk away.</p>\n<p>Harry sprang after him and grabbed his arm. \u201cNo! That\u2019s not\u2014I didn\u2019t know, all right!\u201d He looked positively stricken. Mother was brilliant. \u201cStop assuming I understand this stuff and just <em>tell</em> me. You said\u2014you got him away, he\u2019s here, he\u2019s safe, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, really safe,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cAs long as Draco\u2019s unbonded, he\u2019s still vulnerable. Lucius and Narcissa are in hiding, but if You-Know-Who gets one of them\u2014or if Crabbe and Goyle knock Draco over the head and drag him out to Hogsmeade one weekend\u2014or if the Dark Lord manages to get enough of a Persuadable Potion imbued into a letter\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, I get it!\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want <em>me</em> to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise just stared at him.</p>\n<p>Harry stared back, obviously baffled. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t <em>know</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018I want to own you,\u2019 and you <em>don\u2019t know?</em>\u201d Blaise said. Harry\u2019s whole face flushed scarlet and just as quickly bled white again, that desperate hungry look flashing over him; he swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re the <em>one</em>, Potter. He wants to bond you! No accounting for taste, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014he <em>doesn\u2019t!</em>\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe hates me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise folded his arms and put on a deeply unimpressed expression. \u201cOh yes, he hates you <em>loads</em>, just like you hate him, right? It\u2019s not at all like you\u2019re lying awake at night wishing he was <em>there</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked away, his mouth trembling. He shoved both his hands in his pockets. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014he <em>did</em> that to me! He was just fucking with my head,\u201d he said, but he might as well have tacked on <em>but please convince me otherwise</em> to the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you should know better,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cHave you slept through every Potions class about love philtres? You can\u2019t make someone keep feeling something that isn\u2019t real. Erosmancy\u2019s about finding what\u2019s <em>there</em>.\u201d Fortunately, there was a lot <em>there</em> in any average person, and you could usually find <em>something</em> to work with as long as you were the least bit flexible, Mother liked to say. Not that Draco had needed to do a lot of digging in Harry\u2019s case, obviously. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an enormous secret that Draco\u2019s mad for you. He\u2019s been yanking your pigtails since we were eleven years old.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yanking on them hard enough to pull them out by the roots, but that could be glossed over, and by the startled look Potter gave, he was glossing away right now.</p>\n<p>Blaise went on, \u201cAfter you spat in his face last night, he went straight to shagging his way through half of Slytherin House to try and pretend you didn\u2019t make him <em>miserable</em>,\u201d because no sense in letting Potter raise that point. \u201cAnd if you suppose he told any of them that he wanted to <em>own</em> them, you\u2019re right out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said in a stifled voice. He swallowed and looked away. \u201cAnd\u2014and if\u2014I bond with him\u2014he\u2019d be safe?\u201d Oh yes, <em>completely</em> ready to make the noble sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom getting turned into a power supply, yes,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cYou\u2019d still be on the hook for actually beating You-Know-Who, though.\u201d Which would be just the least bit easier once he\u2019d bonded the strongest erosmancer in the bloody world, but that was far too sensible to work as an angle on Potter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2014he really <em>wants</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise rolled his eyes. \u201cWell not right this <em>minute</em> he doesn\u2019t, after that performance you put on last night with your \u2018I wouldn\u2019t choose you if my life depended on it.\u2019 He\u2019s not getting over that anytime soon. You <em>know</em> him, Potter, he\u2019s an egotistical bastard who thinks he\u2019s Merlin\u2019s gift and us lowly plebeians ought to be grateful to be blessed by his presence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Harry eyed him. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be his friend<em>?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>am</em> his friend,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cHe\u2019s clever and charming as hell when no one is sticking pins in his pride, not that <em>you</em> would know. But he can\u2019t help how he was raised, and right now he\u2019s not going to admit he wants you without instruments of torture involved. He might even let the Ministry ram some senior Auror down his throat, first.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The senior Auror showed up the very next morning\u2014four of them, actually, and a grim-faced Scrimgeour at their head. They walked down the middle of the Great Hall, and Blaise was cautiously pleased to see Harry staring at them with worry and looking over at Draco, who was eyeing them narrowly at the same time: <em>he\u2019d</em> got another letter that morning.</p>\n<p>The Aurors closeted themselves with Dumbledore all morning, and one of them appeared in Potions class. \u201cWe\u2019ll be needing Mr. Malfoy,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Draco stiffened, and Snape said in a cold voice, \u201c<em>Will</em> you. And where precisely is he needed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeadmaster\u2019s office,\u201d the Auror said. \u201cCome along, boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy,\u201d Snape said to him, \u201ca friend may go with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every Slytherin in the room turned to Draco, offering. Blaise leaned over through the crowd and hissed, \u201cTake Potter!\u201d Draco shot a startled look at him. \u201cYou know you can pull him if you have to, and Dumbledore won\u2019t let them shut <em>him</em> up!\u201d Draco darted his eyes at Harry, who was glaring at the Auror in the door with an expression Blaise could only call rabid jealousy. He jerked round and stared straight at Draco, like he felt Draco looking.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said out loud, staring back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs <em>if</em>,\u201d Hermione said, reaching out, but Harry shook her hand off his arm and stood up, somehow managing to look glad and nauseated with terror at the same time, and walked out with Draco without hesitation.</p>\n<p>There really wasn\u2019t any paying attention to classroom work after that. Blaise barely even bothered to try, yearning with his entire being to know what the hell was going on in Dumbledore\u2019s office. It could work out either way. If Draco pulled Harry to stop them forcing him to bond, they\u2019d probably tip over into bonding themselves, and if not, one of the Aurors might get him\u2014but what if Dumbledore stopped it again? And he had no idea if Mother was with them or not. <em>Ugh</em>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Snape never got the chance to inspect his potion. Ten minutes before the end of class, there was a <em>boom</em> of an explosion somewhere overhead, and the lights all trembled and dust came drifting down over their heads. Snape shot to his feet as everyone in the class yelled and started talking at once, and in the confusion, Blaise managed to slip out into the corridor. He ran upstairs to the corridor outside the Headmaster\u2019s office, which was full of smoke and debris, and one of the Aurors came limping out covered in soot, helping Mother, who was a bit disheveled herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise, darling, did you see them?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco?\u201d Blaise said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Harry,\u201d Mother said. \u201cThank you, darling,\u201d she said to the Auror, \u201cperhaps you\u2019ll go start looking? I\u2019m very worried about those poor boys, please do let me know as soon as you\u2019ve found them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of <em>course</em>,\u201d the Auror said earnestly, and dashed off at once eager to impress, and Mother turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>happened?</em>\u201d Blaise said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore, of course!\u201d Mother said in exasperation. \u201cCome, we\u2019d better start looking for them ourselves.\u201d She shut her eyes and stood for a moment, reaching, and then she said, \u201cThis way.\u201d</p>\n<p>They headed off towards the Astronomy Tower. \u201cOf course Scrimgeour meant to make Draco bond one of those Aurors on the spot,\u201d she told him, as they ran, \u201cand Harry promptly offered himself up instead\u2014well done there, darling. Dumbledore immediately said he wasn\u2019t having Draco pressured into any of it, but Scrimgeour, being a man of sense, told Albus that he didn\u2019t care to have the son of a convicted Death Eater get himself trained up properly just to run off to serve You-Know-Who, and two of the Aurors took hold of him. They had a vial of Bottled Bewitchment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Draco pulled Harry?\u201d Blaise said hopefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only,\u201d Mother sighed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a chance. Dumbledore knocked them all flat straightaway. Fortunately, that charming blond one you just saw landed close enough to me that I was able to shove him a good helping of power, and he got up and knocked Albus down in turn. But then Dumbledore\u2019s pet phoenix screeched like a flight of banshees and exploded itself violently, flinging open the door, and Draco ran away at once with Harry right on his heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would <em>hope</em> that they\u2019ve found themselves a nice quiet corner to bond in, but we can certainly rely on Albus to interrupt them <em>again</em> if he finds them first\u2014he dashed out after them immediately. He really hasn\u2019t any excuse being so spry at his age,\u201d she added bitterly.</p>\n<p>But by then they\u2019d got to the Astronomy Tower, and as they climbed up the first turn of the stairs, Blaise in alarm heard Draco snarling, \u201cYou think I need your <em>pity?</em> I don\u2019t need you at all, <em>any</em> of you, not anymore. Voldemort\u2019s sworn an Unbreakable Vow to my Aunt Bellatrix\u2014if I go to him, he\u2019ll let me finish my training. I won\u2019t have to bond anyone at all. He\u2019ll pardon my parents, raise us all back to his inner circle\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise,\u201d Mother said quietly, looking up through the spiral of the stairs, \u201cI\u2019ll give you power. You\u2019ll have to stun him. If you can knock him off the building\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother!\u201d Blaise said, feeling sick.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, darling. But he\u2019s too powerful. We can\u2019t let Voldemort have him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise swallowed hard. She was right, of course she was right, but\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cFine!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, fine, go! Look, there\u2019s the practice brooms, you can take one. If you\u2019d rather run back to Voldemort and help him, when you know what he\u2019d have done to you if he\u2019d had the chance, what he\u2019d do to anyone else\u2014go ahead, <em>I\u2019m</em> not going to stop you,\u201d because he was <em>a blithering idiot</em>, obviously. \u201cWho cares about you anyway, you miserable lying bastard\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Blaise crept up the spiral stairs on his mother\u2019s heels. Harry and Draco were all the way up at the top, he could see them through the gaps of the viewing apparatus. Draco was standing right next to one of the open walls, his fists clenched and his face twisted in fury. \u201cNot <em>you</em>, that\u2019s certain,\u201d Draco hissed. \u201cNot Dumbledore. All of you hate me and my whole family, you always have! Two days ago you swore you wouldn\u2019t come near me if your life depended on it. Why should I care about any of <em>you!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI reckon you <em>shouldn\u2019t</em>,\u201d Harry threw back savagely. \u201cYou should go help Voldemort kill Dumbledore, and me, and all of us who won\u2019t bow down to the Death Eaters\u2014and then you can get started on the real fun, throwing out all the Muggle-borns, murdering and torturing anyone who gets in your way, turning Muggles into slaves\u2014sounds nice, does it? If that\u2019s what you want, you\u2019re right, I <em>don\u2019t</em> care! I\u2014I <em>won\u2019t</em> care! You can just\u2014\u201d His voice cracked, and he stopped talking and turned away.</p>\n<p>Draco whirled away from him. He snatched one of the practice broomsticks off its rack and stalked to the open wall. Blaise shut his eyes as his mother put her hand on his shoulder, the power flowing into him, swelling. Draco was right at the edge. Hit him with a Stunning Spell right now, he\u2019d topple right off. Blaise looked down. His hands were shaking. \u201cMy darling,\u201d Mother whispered, her voice breaking. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s the only way I can keep you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it was the only way he could keep <em>her</em> safe. Voldemort would come after her right away\u2014partly for vengeance, as soon as the Malfoys told him the whole story, and partly to make sure that she didn\u2019t bond one of the Aurors herself, to help Dumbledore\u2019s side. He took his wand out and started raising it.</p>\n<p>A hand abruptly seized his wrist, and Blaise jerked, staring right into Dumbledore\u2019s stern, grim face. Mother stiffened. \u201cDraco\u2019s going to the Dark Lord!\u201d she hissed desperately at Dumbledore. \u201cAlbus, don\u2019t be a <em>fool</em>, you don\u2019t know how strong he is! What that kind of power will let Voldemort <em>do!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d Dumbledore said quietly. \u201cI only know what I will not let <em>you</em> do. Either to Draco, or to Blaise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlaise will be <em>killed</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEsther,\u201d Dumbledore said, almost gently, \u201cthere are worse things by far than dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother straightened up, her eyes going solid white, and then she said, \u201cWorse than watching your <em>child</em> die? Than\u2014watching a <em>sister</em> die?\u201d Dumbledore flinched hard, although he didn\u2019t let go his grip on Blaise\u2019s wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell <em>me</em> to do it. Don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEsther,\u201d Dumbledore said, slowly, a twisting struggle on his face\u2014Mother was pulling with everything she had, Blaise could tell. He didn\u2019t know if he wanted her to succeed or not. He felt like crying. He looked up, desperately\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMother!\u201d he said, and Dumbledore shook his head free of the pull as she jerked and looked up.</p>\n<p>Draco hadn\u2019t got on the broom. He\u2019d turned round. Harry was leaning on one of the stone columns, his face buried in the crook of his arm against it, his shoulders bowed. Draco took a slow, jerking step towards him\u2014and then another, and then he\u2019d dropped the broom with a clatter and crossed the room to him. Harry pulled up out of his arm, tear-streaked, staring at him. \u201cDraco?\u201d he said, his voice cracking, and Draco said, \u201cYou\u2019re an <em>idiot</em>, Potter,\u201d just as brokenly, and they were kissing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t go,\u201d Harry gasped out. \u201cYou stayed.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d never leave you,\u201d Draco said, which landed so squarely on Potter\u2019s id that he let out a noise like a sob. Draco\u2019s eyes were going silver again, and the star-viewer crystals up in the tower were catching the light and magnifying it, going so horribly bright that Blaise had to wince away from it until Dumbledore threw up a Dimming Veil between them and the apparatus. \u201cI\u2019m never going to leave you. You\u2019re mine. Say it. Say you\u2019re mine\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, I\u2019m yours,\u201d Harry said, descending straight to babbling. \u201cYes, please, Draco\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Mother heaved an enormous sigh of relief and leaned against the railing. \u201cThank heavens,\u201d she said, shakily, and then she shook herself and turned to Dumbledore, who was also looking up, a faintly sentimental expression on his face. \u201cWell, Albus, I suppose you <em>could</em> try interfering again, but I\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019d knock <em>you</em> off the building at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore sighed deeply himself and looked at her. \u201cI see no reason to interfere <em>now</em>,\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cHowever, perhaps I should make alternate arrangements for the remainder of Draco\u2019s training.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Merlin\u2019s sake,\u201d Mother said severely. \u201cAnyone rational could see that <em>now</em> my incentive is to see him trained as well as possible. You Gryffindors are simply incomprehensible sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother,\u201d Blaise said, still feeling a bit shaky and also somewhat plaintive, \u201cdo you suppose we could go now? It\u2019s getting a bit soppy in here.\u201d Blaise had a lot of tolerance for listening in to people having ecstatic sexual experiences, and he wouldn\u2019t have minded if they had just got right down to some enthusiastic fucking, but in between ripping each other\u2019s clothing off they were also saying horribly saccharine things like <em>I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it, I never meant any of it, you\u2019re amazing, I want you, I love you, </em>all of it right out loud, which was conveying far more than Blaise needed to know about their innermost desires, although he did highly approve of the bit where Harry swore <em>I\u2019ll disintegrate Voldemort before I ever let him lay a finger on you</em>, even despite the way Draco cooed at him over it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes of course, darling, you must need a cup of tea badly,\u201d Mother said, putting her arm round his shoulders. Blaise leaned against her gratefully. \u201cWhen I think that all this could\u2019ve been settled peacefully and happily in exactly the same manner, three days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must forgive me,\u201d Dumbledore said dryly, as they left the tower. \u201cI think there was a slight but crucial difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glanced up as they went out the door. Faintly from above Blaise heard Harry saying in fervent tones, \u201cOh <em>God</em>, Draco, yes, everything, yes, yes, <em>yes.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p># End</p>"
