  "text": "<p>\u201cI SAID HELP ME!\u201d Izuku shrieks, flailing wildly at his keyboard as his friends\u2019 cackles of delight sounded through his headphones. All he could do was watch in horror as his avatar was ruthlessly defeated by the ghastly monster NPC, unable to escape no matter how many times he tried. The game over graphic lights up his screen without remorse, and he gapes at it and the small box in the corner where Ochako is laughing herself out of her chair. \u201cUravity!\u201d he cried with indignation, \u201cYou traitor! Oh my God!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDude, that was - <em>hah!</em> - that was-\u201d Ochako splutters, snorting loudly then covering her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>horrible</em> at this!\u201d another voice adds with a barking laugh, this time from Dynamight. Izuku\u2019s never seen the guy\u2019s face, but he can still vaguely imagine him cackling in the same vein as his pink-toned best friend. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s hard when my teammates <em>betray</em> me!\u201d Izuku protests, snickering himself, \u201cYou guys were supposed to have my back when I opened the door!\u201d He screws up his face into a frown, even though his camera wasn\u2019t on. \u201cYou knew the monster would be there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHooh, oh boy,\u201d Ochako squeals, expelling the last of her laughter with an exhale as she slumps back in her chair, \u201cSorry, I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the best idea you\u2019ve ever had, Pink Cheeks,\u201d Dynamight adds with a barely hidden snort, confirming that this entire time he and Ochako had been in cahoots to scare the shit out of Izuku. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have agreed to a horror game with the two of them. He always hated horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m never playing with you two again,\u201d Izuku pouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Dynamight retorts. Izuku imagines him smirking with that gravelly voice of his and almost makes himself blush. Ugh, he\u2019s gotta stop doing that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m never playing horror games with you again,\u201d Izuku amends.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Mighty!\u201d Ochako whines, \u201cCome on! It\u2019s funny when you get scared about everything!\u201d </p>\n<p>One glance at the quickly moving chat at the side of his screen lets Izuku know that most of his stream viewers are of the same sentiment, and he heaves a sigh. \u201cYou two are gonna be the death of me, I swear to God. Big bullies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, \u2018s not our fault you\u2019re so fucking skittish,\u201d Dynamight teases, \u201cIt\u2019s just some ghosts and shit. We\u2019re helping you face your fears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of these days I\u2019m going to die early of a heart attack and both of you will be guilty,\u201d Izuku huffs. \u201cJust you wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be heartbroken on that day, I promise,\u201d Ochako says, laying a hand over her heart, \u201cHere lies Small Might, aka Mighty, the greatest gamer to ever walk the earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could look up how to fake cry,\u201d Dynamight adds nonchalantly, \u201cThat\u2019s the best I could do, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMean,\u201d Izuku whines, \u201cYou should be <em>sobbing</em> when I die. Real tears. I deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, the effort to fake tears is more than I\u2019d do for most,\u201d Dynamight protests.</p>\n<p>Izuku rolls his eyes, leaning back in his chair and imagining that Dynamight\u2019s in the same room as his instead of somewhere across the country, behind a screen. \u201cOh, well I guess I\u2019m so very flattered then. The Great Explosion Murder God Dynamight <em>pretending</em> to have emotions just for me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like I got actual emotions to show, now do I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately you were only programmed for rage, right?\u201d Ochako interjects. Izuku laughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cWatch it, Mochi,\u201d Dynamight responds, \u201cI was also programmed with the ability to kick both your asses at any game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My</em> ass?\u201d Izuku and Ochako gasp at the same time. \u201cNo way,\u201d Ochako continues, while Izuku points out that he\u2019s currently ahead of Dynamight in their ongoing competition of who can get the most points in their favorite All Might RPG. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut the hell up, you\u2019re barely ahead!\u201d Dynamight protests with vigor, followed by a <em>thud</em> of him probably slamming his fist against his desk, \u201cThose ten points are <em>bullshit</em>! And I <em>will</em> be regaining my honor. I swear to fuck. Watch yourself, Small Might.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m just going to keep beating you,\u201d Izuku grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will <em>destroy</em> you,\u201d Dynamight growls, and Izuku freezes. His entire face flushes bright red, burning with the heat of a thousand suns. He might\u2019ve forgotten to breath because all he can think is <em>wow, Dynamight\u2019s really close to his microphone, isn\u2019t he?</em> and <em>wow, his voice</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha- I- well,\u201d he stutters, desperate for some sensible response that won\u2019t tell on him anymore than his brief silence already has, \u201cno you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause. Izuku wishes that the earth would swallow him whole and save him the embarrassment of this experience yet <em>again</em>. And then Ochako snickers and deadpans, \u201cWow, Mighty, great comeback.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m beating him!\u201d Izuku protests, quickly giving his head an aggressive shake to pull himself back together. Stupid Dynamight and his stupid hot voice, darn it! He\u2019s gotta stop being made speechless by a guy he wouldn\u2019t even be able to recognize on the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cBarely!\u201d Dynamight retorts, aggravated again. Izuku almost breaths a sigh of relief, but he\u2019s too busy feeling defensive over his rightly earned place above Dynamight in their competition.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, dorks,\u201d Ochako scoffs, \u201cI\u2019m done. That\u2019s all I can handle of you two for the day. Peace.\u201d She throws up a peace sign at the camera and logs off, ending the stream from her end. Izuku barely registers her quip or her exit, both being common when he and Dynamight started arguing about their scores.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy extra ten points aren\u2019t bullshit,\u201d Izuku asserts, crossing his arms over his chest, \u201cI\u2019m just better at negotiation than you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dynamight retorts, \u201cNegotiation <em>is</em> bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit just \u2018cause you\u2019re bad at it, Dynamight,\u201d Izuku laughs, smiling to himself at his friend\u2019s stubbornness. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m hanging up on you now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Dynamight says, then logs off the call before Izuku can get a chance.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m winning,\u201d Izuku says to the audience, just to get in the last word, then finally ends his own stream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took less than twenty-four hours for Dynamight to message him a screenshot of his new high score, twelve points above Izuku\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> BOOM. TAKE THAT FUCKER</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> ??? you didn\u2019t even stream today??</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> didn\u2019t have time</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> and yet you had time to get 22 points\u2026..</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> I always have time to kick ur ass</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> whatever it won\u2019t last long :P</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> forget it loser, I will forever be the number one hero. admit defeat</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> never!!!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku can still clearly remember the first time he ever played ALL MIGHT: NUMBER ONE HERO, the role-playing video game where players would take the part of Japan\u2019s greatest superhero, All Might himself. He and his childhood best friend, Kacchan, were both head-over-heels obsessed with the comic book and TV show legend and jumped at the chance to actually <em>be</em> their idol. They used to fight over who got the controller and who had to watch \u2013 Kacchan won most of those battles, but Izuku usually wasn\u2019t too upset about watching his friend play and yelling advice at him. He practically worshipped the little blonde kid, to be honest.</p>\n<p>The two of them were understandably ecstatic when a hero-themed battle game came out, enthusiastically fighting each other with identical All Might characters \u2013 and again, Izuku wasn\u2019t too bothered when Kacchan beat him almost every time. </p>\n<p>They only got more and more excited with each new All Might or otherwise superhero-themed game that crossed their paths. Those childhood memories were what started Izuku\u2019s passion for video games that had stuck with him long past the time Kacchan had stopped talking to him and he moved half a country away.</p>\n<p>And his nostalgic love for the expansive genre of All Might games that came from that childhood was what made him and Dynamight such fast friends as soon as they crossed paths in the world of video game streamers. It had been Ochako who led Izuku to him, mentioning that she\u2019d found another streamer that seemed, quote, \u201cas obsessive about All Might as you are\u201d. He even had an All Might inspired tag!</p>\n<p>Izuku had watched Dynamight stream once, marveled at his skill and knowledge of the game, and immediately reached out to him without a thought towards his admittedly standoffish reputation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> stay losing then</p>\n<p>\n<em>DYNAMIGHT has logged off</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s yet to regret that decision.</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles and scoffs quietly to himself, closing his messages and returning to his homework. Maybe he can squeeze in time to play before bed tonight, because twelve points is unacceptable. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A mere twelve-point lead is pitiful, but it\u2019s a lead, and it\u2019s all Katsuki has time for between schoolwork and Eijirou hounding him about getting to the gym. His meathead of a best friend won\u2019t take no for an answer. Katsuki logs off to join him as soon as he\u2019s able to rub his admittedly small victory in Mighty\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>\u201cTalking to your boyfriend?\u201d Eijirou asks, leaning up against the doorframe to their shared bedroom and somehow managing to sound genuine. Katsuki flips him off before slipping his phone into his pocket and grabbing his bag. \u201cHey, rude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Katsuki snipes, moving past his friend and towards the front door of their dorm room. Ei, either messing with him or really too stupid to understand that Mighty barely counts as a <em>friend</em> regardless of whether Katsuki\u2019s got a crush on him or not (which he, regrettably, might), follows him with hurt puppy-dog eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Katsuki, you always do this!\u201d he whines.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what,\u201d Katsuki responds flatly, locking the door behind them and heading down the hall. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou never tell me anything about your other friends!\u201d Eijirou says, \u201cI mean, look at me! My best friend\u2019s grinning at his phone like an idiot and I- OW!\u201d Katsuki elbows him in the ribs, scowling.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a <em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know the person he\u2019s talking to!\u201d Eijirou continues like nothing happened, throwing his hands in the air as Katsuki shoves the door open and keeps leading them both towards the on-campus gym.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more you whine the less I wanna say,\u201d Katsuki responds, like he has a thousand times when Eijirou\u2019s complained about not being able to assault Katsuki\u2019s online acquaintances with offers of friendship and heaps of embarrassing stories he keeps in his rock-hard skull. \u201cAnd I ain\u2019t grinning like a fucking idiot about a guy. <em>Any</em> guy.\u201d Sure, Mighty inexplicably has attractive qualities, but it\u2019s not like Katsuki\u2019s fawning over him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell we both know that\u2019s not true,\u201d Eijirou mutters, earning himself another whack. He jolts his hands up to cover himself from more attacks as he laughs. \u201cBro, I\u2019m just saying! The truth is out there.\u201d He starts counting off on his hand. \u201cThere was Shinsou, then the exchange student \u2013 though of course your grins were more \u2018feral attack-dog\u2019 back then \u2013 oh, and can\u2019t forget literal All Might-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Katsuki yells, swinging his gym bag towards Eijoru\u2019s crotch. His friend manages to dodge with an infuriating laugh. <em>This</em> is exactly why he can never let Eijirou and Mighty cross paths \u2013 this, and any number of the facts that Eijirou could let something slip about Katsuki\u2019s unsavory personality that he\u2019s surprised hasn\u2019t scared Mighty off already. \u201cFucker. I\u2019m not going to spot you,\u201d he threatens, \u201cor make dinner tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that!\u201d Eijirou gasps, clasping his hands together in contrition, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I take it all back, please make me ramen, I\u2019ll never insult your taste in men again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were <em>insulting</em> it?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily for Eijirou, Katsuki doesn\u2019t want to go to jail, or else he\u2019d be six feet underground instead of writing an essay at the kitchen counter as Katsuki finishes making ramen for the both of them. It\u2019s a normal situation for the two of them, as doubling the amount of food he made was hardly a burden on Katsuki and Eijirou is perfectly happy to clean up almost every night instead of eating solely toaster waffles and instant noodles for all his college years. </p>\n<p>Eijirou only looks up from his computer when Katsuki drops a bowl next to him on the counter without fanfare. His face lights up and he quickly grabs his chopsticks, nodding at Katsuki. \u201cThanks dude!\u201d Katsuki grunts in response and starts to leave, but Eijirou stops him. \u201cWait, I just remembered something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just saw\u2026\u201d Eijirou starts, scooping a heap of hot noodles into his mouth, \u201cfumfing abfo-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEijirou, I swear to god,\u201d Katsuki interrupts, glaring at this oaf that never seems to think when food is around, especially after a workout.</p>\n<p>Eijirou swallows and gives Katsuki a thumbs up, \u201cThat\u2019s really good dude. Anyways, I saw something about a video game con in Tokyo next month. Are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki frowns, remembering the unanswered email in his inbox from the organizers of the exact convention Eijirou is talking about. They want him to be one of the creators they always have come, because apparently almost three million followers on his Twitch channel will get him that kind of unwanted attention. All he can imagine is random people getting into his business and bothering him at every turn, which is absolute hell. \u201cNo,\u201d he answers, \u201cWhy the hell would I want to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eijirou looks at him like he\u2019s the most unbelievable person on the Earth. \u201cFor real? Dude, you know you could be like, famous if you just showed your beautiful little face for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is exactly why I\u2019m never going to do it,\u201d Katsuki responds, scooping up some his own noodles because he\u2019s getting impatient. He\u2019d been hoping to get in some more points over Mighty after his homework. </p>\n<p>Eijirou huffs, shaking his head like an incredulous mother. \u201cNever could I imagine hating people so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rocks in your brains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut still!\u201d Eijirou continues without acknowledging Katsuki\u2019s quip, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go as <em>Dynamight</em>, you could just go as Katsuki. We could go together! It\u2019d be fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki narrows his eyes at Eijirou, suspicious at the amount of energy he\u2019s putting into selling this convention. \u201cWhy do you want to go in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019d have fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they have Crimson Riot merch there,\u201d Eijirou tries. It was more believable, but Ei had always been a terrible liar. Katsuki keeps waiting, one eyebrow quirked up, and Eijirou deflates. \u201cUravity\u2019s a featured guest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking knew it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki, please. Maybe I just want to get you out the house for once. Maybe I just want to meet your other friends there!\u201d Eijirou frowns, creasing his brow and giving Katsuki that worried look that used to make him see red until he realized that other people\u2019s genuine care for him is not always a negative judge of his character. \u201cSeriously, dude, why are so against me talking to them? You embarrassed of me or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hidden tinge of real hurt in his voice smooths Katsuki\u2019s bristles, and he sighs and sets his bowl of ramen down on the counter. \u201cNo, obviously not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you knew me in high school, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Katsuki answers, doing his best to look Eijirou in the eye and not slam his head into the table. </p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki\u2026\u201d Eijirou starts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Katsuki interrupts, \u201cI\u2019m not that same person I was back then, people change, yada yada yada.\u201d Eijirou frowns at him, and Katsuki grabs his bowl and starts for the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Kat-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Katsuki calls back, closing the door behind him before Eijirou can say anything else. He sets his ramen on his desk and slumps into his chair, glaring at his black computer screen. </p>\n<p>He huffs, running a hand over his face with exasperation. Yes, he knows. He knows he\u2019s been to therapy and worked on anger management and vulnerability, he knows he\u2019s not the same little shithead he used to be, he <em>knows</em>, but all of that just seems to add to his anxiety. Because as much time as he spends playing battle royale games with Uravity or destroying his strict sleeping schedule by staying on call with Mighty until two am, he doubts either of them would ever speak to him again if they knew all the shitty things he used to do and say.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s hinted at it, sure, because you can\u2019t spend as much time talking to someone as he does with Mighty without sharing at least a little bit of personal history like that, but he\u2019s never gone into detail.</p>\n<p>It certainly doesn\u2019t help that Mighty reminds him of Deku.</p>\n<p>God, no, that does not help. Here he is, talking to some guy he\u2019s never even seen the face of, all while thinking about that green-haired kid that seemed a permanent fixture in every good childhood memory he has. The one he hasn\u2019t seen or heard from since middle school, whom with his last conversation with contained a multitude of things he wished he never said. </p>\n<p>He\u2019d told his best fucking friend that he hated him, made him cry, and then never saw him again.</p>\n<p>Yeah, so far, therapy hadn\u2019t been able to crack through that guilt or even make a dent in it. It might\u2019ve helped if Katsuki could find the guy and apologize to him for it, but he has no idea where Deku is or how to contact him. He hadn\u2019t even realized he moved away permanently until his third unexplained absence from school. By that point, it was too late, and he\u2019d figured Deku would rather not hear from him. Besides, back then, apologizing was not something he did. Little shithead.</p>\n<p>Katsuki groans into his hand, dropping his head onto his desk with a thunk. He\u2019s a fucking disaster. And an idiot. It\u2019s not like Eijirou would walk up to Uravity and immediately list off all of Katsuki\u2019s most fucked-up qualities. It\u2019s not like someone like Eijirou would even <em>have</em> a list of Katsuki\u2019s most fucked up qualities. It\u2019s just\u2026strange, for him to imagine his real life and his online life overlapping. Maybe it\u2019d be good for him. He does get the sense that Mighty and Eijirou would hit it off if they ever met, though that might not be the best situation for Katsuki. </p>\n<p>Just then, Katsuki\u2019s computer screen lights up with a notification from Mighty himself. Katsuki scrambles into an upright position in his seat, fighting a smile even though he\u2019d been feeling like shit just moments before. That\u2019s something that Mighty and Deku had in common.</p>\n<p>Katsuki logged on to his computer and opened the message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> DYNAMIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> you good?</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> GUES HWAT</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> GUESE FUCKJRNG WHAT</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> what</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> I JYSTR HIT THREE KILLION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> MILLION</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> IM CGONONA COMBYST THIS SI TSO COOL</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki quickly opens another tab to find that Twitch user SmallMight had just, in fact, reached three million followers. God damn. Another grin fights its way to his lips. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> damn congrats</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at the screen for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> :)</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> S;ALDKFSL;\u2019SDFKDF KS; FGK;SDSKGJDLK;GS;FDLKF;S</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> THSNK YOU!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> GONNE BE HONEST THO IM SCARED</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> why tf</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> BC THATS.

How could one guy be so god damned <em>endearing</em> while being so god damned dumb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> whatever you say, dummy</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> meanie &gt;:( I am having a Moment okay!!!! this is a lot!!!!!

He <em>had</em> promised a face reveal if he ever did reach the milestone, and Katsuki had spent a good while thinking about it, but he hadn\u2019t expected it to come so fast. He isn\u2019t sure how to feel now that it\u2019s actually going to happen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> actually I didn\u2019t remember but my followers sure did my dms are exploding I haven\u2019t even posted anything yet</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> why did I think this was ever a good idea????????

He jumps around his room and pumps his fist wildly, trying to release all the excited energy in his body while also not bothering his roommate right outside his door with too much noise. He doesn\u2019t succeed, however, because Todoroki knocks on the door and he still can\u2019t stop shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Todoroki asks as soon as Izuku opens the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku manages, voice cracking and grin plastered to his face. Todoroki blinks at him in slight confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2026sure-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI JUST HIT THREE MILLION FOLLOWERS!\u201d Izuku practically screams, jumping up and down.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Todoroki says, nodding, \u201cCongratulations, Midoriya.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Izuku squeals, darting forward to squeeze his roommate in a tight hug. He releases him quickly, leaving Todoroki stiff and somewhat wide-eyed in his doorway. Izuku\u2019s too busy rambling to really notice, and its normal behavior for Todoroki anyways. \u201cIt was so crazy! I almost didn\u2019t notice! I think I\u2019m gonna make katsudon \u2013 do you want Katsudon, Todoroki? I\u2019ll make some for you. As a celebratory dinner! Three million is such a big number. Way more than a thousand, and even a thousand is a lot. You couldn\u2019t fit that many people in a room I don\u2019t think. Do you think you could build a room that big? I don\u2019t think you \u2013 Oh my god, I said I\u2019d show them my face. I only said that because I thought it\u2019d never happen! Now what? I gotta show my face! Oh man, that\u2019s no good, I\u2019m so self-conscious of my looks, this is a terrible-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re handsome,\u201d Todoroki interrupts, making Izuku freeze in the middle of the kitchen with his hands still over his face, peeking through his fingers at his friend. Todoroki just stares back, head tilted a little to the side. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Izuku says, cheeks blooming red.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re handsome,\u201d Todoroki repeats in his unique, slightly confused tone, \u201cMost people would agree. I don\u2019t see why you are nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh hah,\u201d Izuku squeaks, keeping his hands over his pink cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Dynamight would agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s eyes blow wide and he chokes on his own voice, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>A hint of a smirk plays at Todoroki\u2019s deadpan face, \u201cIs that not who you worry most about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku drops his hands to his sides, incredulous, \u201cOh my <em>God</em>, you are the worst. What has Ochako been telling you?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she wrong?\u201d Todoroki retorts, avoiding the question. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe- I- you know what?\u201d Izuku starts, trying to defend himself but unable to when he knows full well that Dynamight\u2019s rough voice made an appearance in his dreams last night, attached to a murky imagination of what adult Kacchan might look like because one inexplicable reminded of the other, \u201cI\u2019m going to make myself dinner now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have some too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Izuku told Ochako his big news over the phone, she started screaming, and Izuku remembered why she held the title of his best friend for all these years. Her excitement was palpable despite her being at her house multiple miles away, probably scaring the shit out of her poor parents.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019M SO HAPPY FOR YOU IZUKU!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Izuku grins, keeping the phone a good distance from his ear until she calms down, while he lays back on his bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cAAH! So cool. You deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>true</em>!\u201d Ochako asserts. Izuku can imagine her shoving her finger into his chest in her aggressively affirming way. \u201cIn fact, you deserve even <em>more</em>, because you\u2019re funny and smart and awesome and a lot of other things, but it\u2019ll happen! It\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I get it, you can stop now,\u201d Izuku laughs, face warm. He\u2019s never going to be very good at taking compliments.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of you,\u201d Ochako responds, suddenly sounding teary. She even sniffled loudly to add to the effect. \u201cSo proud. My little baby, all grown up.\u201d Izuku snorts. \u201cSo! Are you going to do anything to celebrate? I mean, obviously I\u2019m going to throw a party for you, but like in terms of a stream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Ochako, a party isn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m throwing you one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s so much work-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku!\u201d There\u2019s a warning tone in her voice.</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs. \u201cFine, fine. Just don\u2019t spend a lot of money or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWon\u2019t be a problem, I don\u2019t have any,\u201d Ochako answers, \u201cSo? Celebration stream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Izuku starts, \u201cI actually did promise my followers that I\u2019d do a face reveal at 3 million\u2026\u201d Ochako makes a noise of interest. \u201cAnd based on my DMs they <em>all</em> remember that promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoooooh <em>yes</em>,\u201d Ochako says, \u201cFinally, the world can see your adorable little face!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you too,\u201d Izuku mutters to himself, covering his face with his free hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how Dy-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to god if you say anything about Dynamight,\u201d Izuku interrupts, making Ochako cackle.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Izuku, come on!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you the one bringing Todoroki in on all this?\u201d Izuku accuses.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah!\u201d Ochako answers without shame, \u201cDude, you can\u2019t expect me to sit through all your romantic tension and <em>not</em> vent about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no tension!\u201d Izuku exclaims, ear burning, \u201cRomantic or otherwise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Ochako deadpans, \u201cKeep telling yourself that, Izuku. You know, I bet you told him about this before you told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku opens his mouth to defend himself, but he can\u2019t. She\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t know how, but she is. For whatever reason, there hadn\u2019t seemed to have been any other option of who to go to with his good news the moment he got it. He\u2019d messaged Dynamight without a second thought. \u201cWh-I- okay, well. It\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d Ochako laughs again. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend, I can tell him stuff!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm, mm hm,\u201d Ochako hums, \u201cReally great friendship. Love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so tired of the constant slander.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad, you lovable dork, you\u2019re the dumbest smart person I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou give me whiplash sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, back to your face reveal,\u201d Ochako says, \u201cI\u2019m so excited for that. When are you gonna do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku exhales in defeat. \u201cAs soon as possible, probably. Get it over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait!\u201d Ochako responds, cackling somewhat maniacally, \u201cYou already have so many simps and soon you will have an <em>army</em> of them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t- there\u2019s not-\u201d Izuku stutters, then stops with a sigh. \u201cSometimes I think that girlfriend of yours is corrupting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, hey there!\u201d Ochako exclaims, feigning offence, \u201cJust because you don\u2019t have a hot vampire girlfriend doesn\u2019t mean you get to bash mine, Izuku. Have some class, she\u2019s the love of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she actually a vampire? Because I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Izuku muses, thinking about all the toothy grins Ochako\u2019s partner, Toga, had given him over the years. Everyone had been scared of her back in high school, and probably still would be now if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she was dating Ochako, and Ochako would most likely never let her girlfriend murder someone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a secret I\u2019ll never tell,\u201d Ochako says, \u201cWhat I do know is that she\u2019s the most interesting person I\u2019ve ever met, and I love her.\u201d Izuku rolls his eyes. There\u2019s some noise on the other end of the call, and Ochako shouts something indecipherable, probably to her parents. \u201cOops, I gotta go,\u201d she says to Izuku.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re going to stream, I wanna watch,\u201d she adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably post about it soon,\u201d Izuku answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll look out for it. Love you, bye!\u201d</p>\n<p>She hangs up, and Izuku sits up in his bed and opens his Twitter. Ignoring the many, many unopened DMs, he composes a new tweet:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Mighty</strong> @smallmight</p>\n<p>thank you all so much for 3mil!!! I appreciate u all sm, thank you thank you thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc9a face reveal tomorrow (I didn\u2019t forget!!)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He posts it before he can chicken out, and immediately shuts his phone off. Withing twenty-four hours of now, he will have shown his face to the world. To Dynamight. Which is fine. It\u2019s fine. Totally and completely fine. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tells himself that all through the night and following day, all the way up until he\u2019s sitting in his desk chair, cursor hovering over the button to start his stream. His nerves are buzzing wildly, hands shaking, so he resorts to a few breathing techniques his high school therapist taught him to overcome anxiety. This is fine. He does genuinely want to do this. It\u2019ll be fun. Making himself a little mini celebrity. Fun! </p>\n<p>He smiles a bit, heart slowing. Yeah, this\u2019ll be fun. Maybe he\u2019ll even get to see Dynamight\u2019s face after showing his own. </p>\n<p>Izuku knows he doesn\u2019t really need to see Dynamight\u2019 face, that they can be great friends nonetheless, but at the same time, he wants to. The two of them have already had conversations longer and deeper than conversations he\u2019d had with anyone else, all while on a simple voice call at twelve in the morning. He knows quite a lot about the guy he knows barely anything about.</p>\n<p>Though, if he ever did see Dynamight\u2019s face, he\u2019d have to crush the impossible hope that Dynamight really was secretly Kacchan, his previous close friend/childhood crush, for good. It was unfair of him to do that anyways, so it would be for the best, but still. </p>\n<p>Izuku shook his head, bringing his focus back to the present moment and his impending life-changing event (okay, it\u2019s not <em>really</em> that big of a deal, but let him have his moment). </p>\n<p>He starts his stream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki will never admit it, but he jumps when the notification that Mighty has started streaming pops up on his screen, and he clicks on it faster than he\u2019s clicked on anything. For some stupid reason, the prospect of finally seeing what this man looks like is giving him butterflies. Wait, no, not butterflies. Just\u2026nerves, or whatever. They\u2019re annoying either way. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Mighty\u2019s voice comes through his speakers with a slight shake of nervousness. The screen is still black. The chat starts filling up with excited fans and congratulations. \u201cHey all! How\u2019s everyone\u2019s afternoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s knee won\u2019t stop bouncing as he listens to Mighty go on and on about how grateful he is to all his supporters and how he never saw this happening to him. He\u2019s such a dork that Katsuki can\u2019t help but grin, shaking his head at his friend\u2019s antics. Mighty never can seem to stop rambling. And Katsuki knows a lot of his story by now, about how he started streaming in high school in an attempt to gain some confidence and find a community of like-minded people, away from the bullies of his early school days. Hearing that, Katsuki had practically begged to hear a mid-puberty Mighty talking about All Might, thinking of all the glorious voice cracks he could make fun of, but he\u2019d stopped as soon as Mighty had turned the request back on him. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay, I see in the chat that people are getting impatient with my rambling, I get it,\u201d Mighty says, a smile tinging his voice in a stupidly attractive way that only he seems to manage. Katsuki nearly thumps himself in the head. How\u2019s he supposed to cope with this man\u2019s face when he can barely hear his voice without thinking it\u2019s hot. He needs to pull himself together. \u201cI guess it\u2019s finally time for me to turn my camera on,\u201d Mighty continues, then pauses for a drawn out second, \u201cUnless there\u2019s\u2026any more questions people want me to answer\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki knows he\u2019s stalling, and everyone in the chat does too. They encourage him to go through with it, with a few people suggesting that he answer more questions with the camera on instead. </p>\n<p>\u201cFiiiine, fine, fine,\u201d Mighty surrenders, \u201cLet me just\u2026\u201d There\u2019s a few clicking noises. Katsuki fidgets with one of his rings, waiting in a very causal and calm way. \u201cOkay,\u201d Mighty says, \u201cThree, two, one!\u201d</p>\n<p>The camera turns on. Katsuki\u2019s heart stops. </p>\n<p>Staring back at him from his computer screen, with a dorky, nervous grin and messy green hair he would\u2019ve recognized from a mile away, is <em>Deku</em>. </p>\n<p>Deku. </p>\n<p><em>That</em> Deku.</p>\n<p>WHAT THE FUCK?</p>\n<p>Sure, he\u2019s changed. His curly hair is a little longer, a little darker, his face a bit sharper and less like the round, apple-cheeked kid he used to be, his shoulders much broader and his voice obviously deeper. But he\u2019s still got those stupid ass freckles splattered <em>everywhere</em> across his face, and those bright green eyes that squint when he smiles. He\u2019s still Deku. <em>Izuku</em>. All grown up and still the nerd he used to be. </p>\n<p>Of <em>course</em> Mighty always reminded Katsuki of Deku. Of <em>course</em> he had such familiar mannerisms. THEY WERE THE SAME FUCKING PERSON!</p>\n<p>\u201cTa-da!\u201d Deku/Mighty laughs nervously, and suddenly Katsuki can\u2019t comprehend how he didn\u2019t assign the voice to his childhood friend before. It\u2019s so characteristically <em>Deku</em>. He\u2019s a fucking idiot. Dear god. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Deku continues, flattening his hands under his chin with that dumbass smile. The camera frame allows a view of his upper arms when he does this, leading to the conclusion that Deku is certainly not the scrawny, skinny little kid he used to be. </p>\n<p>You\u2019ve gotta be fucking kidding.</p>\n<p>Yeah, what\u2019s worse than the fact that Katsuki has been unknowingly talking to his tragic childhood best friend this whole time, is that his tragic childhood best friend is <em>hot now</em>. He had been right about Mighty, in the worst possible way. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, wow, guys\u2026that\u2019s- you\u2019re,\u201d Deku stammers with another stupidly attractive laugh, reading through the innumerable compliments spamming the chat, \u201cyou\u2019re so nice, thank you. Oh \u2013 hi Ochako.\u201d His face is quickly flushing red, just like it used to. </p>\n<p>Katsuki\u2019s having a fucking crisis. </p>\n<p>After years of agonizing over the way things ended with Deku, he finally has the actual chance to talk to him again. To say he\u2019s sorry. Ask how Auntie Inko\u2019s doing. Ask him when the fuck he started being hot. So many things. All he\u2019d have to do was\u2026tell Deku who he is. </p>\n<p>Shit. How should he start? <em>Hi, remember that one kid you used to know who told you he hated you? Well that\u2019s me, and I think you\u2019re cute now, please don\u2019t hate me.</em> Deku would never go for that. </p>\n<p>Actually, Katsuki thinks with a heavy sigh, he probably would. If there was one thing Deku was, it was forgiving. That\u2019s why they made a good pair; because Deku was nice enough for two and Katsuki could hold enough grudges for three. There\u2019s a good chance the nerd is the same way now. </p>\n<p>Katsuki stares at Deku on his screen, watching him stammer out \u2018thank you\u2019s to his viewers and ramble on about certain posters on the wall of his room behind him, and slammed his head forward onto his desk. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku finally manages to stop the stream, letting out a breath of relief and sinking deep into his chair, almost sliding to the floor. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he breathes aloud, clutching his fist over his racing heart, \u201cI did it. Oh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>His notifications buzz, and he almost expects it to be Dynamight \u2013 saying what he had no idea \u2013 but it\u2019s Ochako. He smiles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> IZUKU BBY IM SO PROUD OF U</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> PRETTY BOY &lt;3</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> UR GONNA HAVE SO MANY SIMPS</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> thank you but enough about the simps please I don\u2019t need any</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> ohohohoh but you will have them</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> okay I get it</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> ANYWAYS I forgot to ask you yesterday but! remember how I got invited to that con a bit ago?</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> yeah\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> I think you should come with me!! :D</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> aren\u2019t I already?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku isn\u2019t going to miss out on a chance for more official All Might merchandise \u2013 some of that stuff only gets sold at cons!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> I mean as smallmight, not just some guy</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> I can email the runners and get them to list you as a feature again even though you turned it down before</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku had, in fact, turned down StreamCon\u2019s invitation to be a featured creator at their con, because it had seemed like a lot of pressure and attention. Besides, at the time none of his followers had known what he looked like, and he hadn\u2019t really been planning on changing that. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> HWAT</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> LIKE PEOPLE WOULD COME TO MEET ME???</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> zuku people are gonna recognize you anyways now might as well get PAID</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stares at the screen, feeling like an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> oh yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> lmao I assume ur in then?</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> do I have another choice?? </p>\n<p><strong>Uravity:</strong> bills to pay my friend!! lemme email them I\u2019ll get you ur money</p>\n<p>\n<em>Uravity has logged off</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku takes a deep breath, rubbing his temples and trying to wrap his head around the idea of going to a con and getting legitimately recognized. A <em>featured creator</em>. That used to be a spot reserved for people like Horikoshi Kohei, the creator of freaking All Might, not Izuku. </p>\n<p>He glances at Dynamight\u2019s icon on his screen, noticing the green dot at the bottom that marks him active, and gets a shaky idea. He opens the chat. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> hey!! I have a query</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes a bit longer than expected for Dynamight to replay, and Izuku waits nervously, but eventually the message comes. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> who tf calls it a \u2018query\u2019</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> smart people. anyways</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> are you going to StreamCon?</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> wasn\u2019t planning on it, why?</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> well I\u2019m going with uravity</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> she\u2019s trying to get them to make me a featured creator which is a whole other thing but</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> uh. I was thinking that if you went we could meet. maybe</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> :)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dynamight doesn\u2019t answer. For a very long time, Dynamight doesn\u2019t answer. Izuku starts to think that this was a terrible idea. A really no good terrible horrible very bad idea. What was he thinking? Why, after over a year of knowing each other through voice and nothing more, would Dynamight want to meet with him in real life. They didn\u2019t even know each other\u2019s names! He\u2019d only seen Izuku\u2019s face two minutes ago! Izuku still hadn\u2019t seen his face! What was he-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> sure</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>WHAT.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Stay calm, Izuku! Calm!!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> oh! cool! very cool</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> my friend was bothering me about going anyways</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> but I will NOT be going as Dynamight, so no fucking outing me</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> of course of course no problemo </p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> good</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> I gotta go</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> oh okay! later!!</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> later</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> cute freckles btw</p>\n<p>\n<em>DYNAMIGHT has logged off</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku stifled a scream. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Eijirou!\u201d Katsuki shouts across the dorm. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Eijirou shouts back from the couch where he\u2019s watching TV.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou owe me 150 dollars, these con tickets are expensive as shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, <em>what</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki doesn\u2019t answer, and it doesn\u2019t take his roommate long to appear in the doorway with wide eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to StreamCon?\u201d he exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d Katsuki responds, barely glancing away from his computer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah, but what changed your mind?\u201d Eijirou asks, trying to peek at Katsuki\u2019s screen but only seeing the con site. Katsuki feels his ears start to burn and he purses his lips in annoyance. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, I just did,\u201d he answers. </p>\n<p>Eijirou is quiet for a moment, then raises his eyebrows, \u201cIs Mighty going-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Katsuki snaps, flipping him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cOH MY GOD I KNEW IT!\u201d Eijirou shouts, grinning, \u201cHe did his face reveal didn\u2019t he? He\u2019s hot. He\u2019s gotta be hot. You\u2019ve got a crush-\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki rolls his chair across the room and slams the door in Eijirou\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d comes the muffled shout, followed by laughter. Katsuki buries his burning face in his hands. </p>\n<p>\u201c150!\u201d he calls back, dragging his hand down his face and rolling back to his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything for young love!\u201d Eijirou responds, cackling some more but thankfully not trying to come back in the room else Katsuki would have to strangle him. Fucking dumbass. </p>\n<p>He almost wishes he could go without Eijirou, but he knew that wouldn\u2019t be fair to his friend, especially after their conversation the other day. It\u2019s just going to be difficult to manage annoying crowds, his loudass friend, <em>and</em> an attempted surprise reunion/apology with Midoriya Izuku, of all people. It probably wouldn\u2019t be the best setting for such an encounter, but he just can\u2019t imagine doing it anywhere but in person. </p>\n<p>Besides, if he\u2019s being honest with himself, he really fucking misses Deku, and he really fucking wants to see the stupid look on his face when he realizes who Dynamight really is. As long as he doesn\u2019t run away, it should all be good. Yep!</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah, he <em>is</em> cute!\u201d Eijirou shouts from outside the door. \u201cI get it now!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be all good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next few weeks pass far faster than Katsuki realized, and suddenly it was the day of the convention and he felt no more prepared than he had on the day he agreed to this. Eijirou had ended up getting very excited about the prospect of surprising Deku, despite not knowing anything about his history, because every time Katsuki tried to tell him he\u2026decided against it. <em>Not</em> chickening out, just deciding that he didn\u2019t want to deal with all of Eijirou\u2019s questions. His past was his own, he could tell his friend whatever he wanted. </p>\n<p>Regardless, Eijirou was even more excited about Katsuki about the whole thing, even calling his girlfriend and Katsuki\u2019s friend Mina and forcing Katsuki to listen to her spout nonsense romantic advice for a good twenty minutes while he tried to get dressed before they left. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting dressed right now?\u201d Mina exclaimed when Katsuki complained about it, her voice loud and bubbly against the background noise of the train she was on, \u201cMake sure you wear something hot!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEx-fucking-cuse you?\u201d Katsuki snapped, offended that she\u2019d even question his fashion choices, \u201cI\u2019m not in first damn year, Mina, I know how to dress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Mina says, \u201cI can still remember the first day you tied your tie right. I was so proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki grumbles, grabbing his third t-shirt attempt out of his dresser and holding it up to assess. It\u2019s his old black skull t-shirt, something his mom had gotten him as a joke because it was the exact same as his favorite shirt as a kid. Something Deku would maybe recognize.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you have to go through so many shirts,\u201d Eijirou interjects from his seat on his bed, \u201cIt\u2019s just clothes, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplains why you\u2019re dressed like that,\u201d Katsuki retorts at the same time Mina makes a sympathetic <em>oh, honey</em> noise at her boyfriend. </p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Eijirou grumbles, slumping backwards. Katsuki slips the skull shirt over his head, ruffles his hair back into place, and shuts his dresser.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re leaving now. Bye, Mina.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Mina yelps, \u201cEi, what\u2019s he wearing?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Eijirou says, standing up and assessing Katsuki\u2019s outfit, \u201cBlack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s back to the Hot Topic employee stuff,\u201d Mina bemoans as Katsuki gives Eijirou a look, halfway between a glare and incredulous. Eijirou just shrugs. \u201cKatsuki, please, just keep your hair off your face and we can avoid going full 2000s emo-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood <em>bye</em>,\u201d Katsuki interrupts, swiping Eijirou\u2019s phone off the dresser and hanging up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, dude!\u201d Eijirou whines, grabbing his phone back and pouting at it, \u201cI needed to say I love you! I\u2019m gonna call her back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>godddd</em>!\u201d Katsuki groans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After what felt like an eternity later, Katsuki finally parks outside the convention center and heads inside, hands shoved deep inside his jeans pockets as he fidgets with his rings. The center is full to the brim with nerds of all kinds, some in detailed cosplays that even manage to impress Katsuki and his specific knowledge of video game character design. Eijirou spots a Crimson Riot cosplayer and immediately freaks out, forcing Katsuki to take hundred of pictures and gushing enough to make this random person\u2019s day. After that\u2019s over with, he decides it\u2019s high time to message Deku, letting him know that they\u2019re here. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> here with my friend</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> yay!!! im in the featured creator section (obviously) but I get a break in about half an hour for lunch. we can meet in the \u2018backstage\u2019 area so people don\u2019t recognize you :)</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> I\u2019ll let the security people know you\u2019re coming</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> ps can you believe they have security here???? I feel famous this is very weird</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> someone asked me to sign their ARM. like what</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> wait what should I tell the security people to look out for</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> someone blonde dragging around a (fake) redhead</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> hmmm so are you blonde or a fake redhead</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> I\u2019m a real fucking blonde, bitch</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> I wasn\u2019t doubting you!!</p>\n<p><strong>SmallMight:</strong> see you soon :D</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIGHT:</strong> yep</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Eijirou says suddenly over his should, making Katsuki jump.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d he yells, elbowing a laughing Eijirou in the ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Eijirou snickers, \u201cI was just wondering what was up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna meet him in the back in half an hour,\u201d Katsuki answers, slipping his phone in his back pocket.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh, fancy, the back,\u201d Eijirou says, grinning, \u201cYour man\u2019s getting us the celebrity treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up, I swear to God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly crap there\u2019s another Crimson Riot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki spends the next thirty minutes wandering around the convention, letting Eijirou strike up conversations with strangers while he browses All Might merchandise and avoids talking to much in case his voice is recognized. He ends up buying a limited-edition baseball cap with the bright yellow All Might V embroidered to the front and a Mirko keychain before it\u2019s time to go meet Deku. He clips the keychain of his second-favorite superhero to his belt loop and puts the cap on after proving to the random security guards that his hair is, in fact, blonde. It isn\u2019t too necessary, though, because apparently one of them has a kid who watches his streams and recognizes his voice.</p>\n<p>Eijirou gives him excited grins as they\u2019re led down a short hall into the room where Deku and Uravity and who knows who else are waiting for them, while Katsuki\u2019s busy trying to convince himself that this isn\u2019t a terrible mistake. It\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019ll just have to get Deku somewhere private to talk to him. It\u2019ll be <em>fine</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, is that Dynamight?\u201d a voice calls, and Katsuki jolts back to reality to find that he\u2019s reached the room. And there Deku is, lounging on a couch next to Uravity, who\u2019s grinning at Katsuki with amusement. </p>\n<p>Izuku, however, is staring at him wide green eyes and a slightly open mouth, completely and totally frozen. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt sure is!\u201d Eijirou answers proudly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, is that Dynamight?\u201d Ochako exclaims, turning her head at the entrance of two people Izuku almost hadn\u2019t noticed. His heart rate skyrockets, and he can hardly turn his head fast enough. </p>\n<p>He meets a pair of fiery red eyes, and his heart just stops. </p>\n<p>Staring back at him is a grown man that looks exactly like his childhood best friend. Soft, spiky ash blonde hair, sharp features, breathtaking red eyes. The man even stands like Kacchan, shoulders back, chin up in permanent confidence. For fuck\u2019s sake, the man was even wearing Kacchan\u2019s favorite shirt! Just\u2026a much larger version.</p>\n<p>And holy fucking shit, older Kacchan is even hotter than Izuku remembered him being.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sure is!\u201d the redhead next to \u2013 Kacchan? Dynamight?? Izuku isn\u2019t sure what to believe now \u2013 says, grinning proudly. Izuku blinks a few times in quick succession, looking between the both of them until he finally lands on Kacchan \u2013 this has to be Kacchan, he has to be. He opens his mouth to say something, ask if this man really is who Izuku thinks he is, but no coherent sound comes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-y- um. You, uh. Wh-\u201d he stammers, looking Dynamight up and down and not believing a single thing he sees, \u201cYou- uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Dynamight starts slowly, clearing his throat. \u201cSup, Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku stares at him blankly, feeling his heart thud against his ribcage. Once. Twice. Three times. </p>\n<p>And then he jumps off the couch and flings himself at Kacchan with an almost inhuman screeching noise. \u201cWHAT THE <em>FUCK</em>, KACCHAN?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSHIT!\u201d Kacchan yelps back, stumbling backwards and toppling to the ground upon Izuku\u2019s impact. \u201cIZUKU, WHAT THE HELL?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSTOP YELLING!\u201d Izuku yells, tears bubbling out at he squeezes his arms tightly around Kacchan\u2019s neck and sandwiches him against the floor. He covers Kacchan\u2019s mouth his hand before the blonde can respond. \u201cI am so mad at you, oh my god!\u201d Izuku cries, feeling every single emotion he\u2019s ever felt about Kacchan all at once. He can\u2019t even begin to imagine what all this looks like to their friends, but he doesn\u2019t care. What the hell is even going on? \u201cYou owe me so many explanations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan picks that as the perfect time to lick Izuku\u2019s hand, making him shriek and jolt away, rolling off his friend and thudding to the ground beside them. </p>\n<p>\u201cDISGUSTING!\u201d Izuku whines, wiping his hand desperately on Kacchan\u2019s shirt. Kacchan grabs his wrist with a grin and shove the infected hand back into Izuku\u2019s face, rubbing his own palm down his cheek. \u201cHey, stop it! You jerk!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou started it,\u201d Kacchan replies, dropping Izuku\u2019s hand with a self-satisfied shrug. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, I think I deserve to tackle you a few times,\u201d Izuku retorts. </p>\n<p>Kacchan just looks at him for a second, expression foreign as a small smile appears on his lips. \u201cYeah, fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku lower lip starts to tremble, and the tears flow freely before he can stop them, lunging forward to wrap Kacchan in another tight hug. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he managed, voice warbling.</p>\n<p>It certainly doesn\u2019t help his emotional state when Kacchan hugs him back and mutters, \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What the fuck</em>,\u201d someone whispers, making both of them jolt to find that both Ochako and Kacchan\u2019s friend are staring at them like they just saw aliens for the first time. Izuku scrambles back and onto his feet, allowing Kacchan to do the same. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s friend repeats, running a hand through his bright red hair like his brain just broke. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ochako agrees, look to Izuku for answers he\u2019s not quite sure how to give her.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he starts, gesturing towards Kacchan, \u201cSo, this is Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot actually my name,\u201d Kacchan says, looking anywhere but Ochako and his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku says, \u201cBakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>Katsuki immediately makes a face, scrunching up his nose. \u201cEw, don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? You just said-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou specifically should stick with Kacchan, alright,\u201d Kacchan clarifies, making Izuku snort. \u201cShut up, Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Deku</em>?\u201d Ochako repeats, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s not actually-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a term of endearment,\u201d Kacchan interrupts, making Izuku blink in surprise as his face turns pink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a- never mind,\u201d Ochako sighs, \u201cI don\u2019t even\u2026do I want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> want to know!\u201d Kacchan\u2019s friend exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of your business, Eijirou,\u201d Kacchan responds. </p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s still stuck on <em>term of endearment</em>. That, of course, is when Kacchan decides to nudge him with his elbow and say, \u201cIzuku?\u201d in a very soft voice. He might as well have shot him point blank.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Izuku</em>?\u201d Izuku repeats, voice cracking as he looks at Kacchan with wide eyes. Kacchan\u2019s ears turn red. His ears are pierced!</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just your fucking name, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I need to lay down for several hours,\u201d Izuku breaths.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is going <em>on</em>?\u201d Ochako cries.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we know each other,\u201d Izuku answers to the best of his ability.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Ochako responds, almost shouting, \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Round Face-\u201d Kacchan starts, glaring, but Izuku puts a hand on his chest to stop him before he can start a fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually Kacchan, I think you\u2019re the one who has the most explaining to do,\u201d he says, narrowing his eyes at his friend. He notices just then, to his absolute dismay, that despite all his growth over the years his friend still holds the height advantage by a measly inch or two. Dammit. </p>\n<p>Kacchan huffs, looking between him and their two watching friends, \u201cCan\u2019t we talk somewhere else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ochako answers, \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku answers quickly before Kacchan can get aggressive, patting his friend\u2019s chest where his hand still lays, \u201cYes, we can go talk somewhere else, <em>after</em> you give a very brief explanation to all three of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan glares at him, but Izuku stares right back long enough for him to give in. \u201cFine,\u201d he concedes, \u201cI\u2019m Dynamight. Always have been. Only realized that I already knew Izuku when he did the whole face reveal thing. Came to meet him again. End of story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a while,\u201d Izuku adds for clarification, then shakes his head in disbelief, \u201cWait, you knew for multiple weeks and never said anything? Kacchan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck was I supposed to message you about this!\u201d Kacchan says, throwing his hands up, \u201cBesides, this was funnier.\u201d He grins to himself and snorts. \u201cYou had your dumbass surprised face. Looked like you did that time Auntie got you tickets to that movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the worst,\u201d Izuku says, thumping his fist against Kacchan\u2019s chest, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you remember that I\u2019m not the one who peed mysel-\u201d Kacchan\u2019s hands clamps over his mouth with startling efficiency as Kacchan gives him a purely murderous look, ears burning red again. Izuku just cackles against the hand, feeling vindicated. </p>\n<p>\u201cFinish that sentence and you\u2019ll never speak again,\u201d Kacchan threatens. Izuku can\u2019t contain his laughter, starting to shake, and he promptly shrieks when Kacchan yanks him into a headlock, mussing up his hair. \u201cLittle shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d Izuku grins, shoving his way out of Kacchan\u2019s arms, though not without noticing just how muscular they are. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I know you are but what am I?</em>\u201d Kacchan mocks, making a face, \u201cYou\u2019re a five-year-old, that\u2019s what you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, you just mocked me like a baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the hell up,\u201d Kacchan says, elbowing him in the ribs, \u201cNow is there anywhere else to go in this fucking place?\u201d He turns back to the hall that led him here, catching sight of something on the ground that he picks up. \u201cDeku! You threw my fucking hat on the ground!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were wearing a hat?\u201d Izuku responds.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Well, look at this shit,\u201d Kacchan says, fitting the cap to his head and turning around to show it off. Izuku\u2019s eyes go wide at the classic vintage insignia in bright yellow stitching across the front, and he stifles a screech. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>god</em>, is that limited edition?\u201d he yelps, grabbing at the hat. Kacchan snatches it off his head and out of Izuku\u2019s grasp before he can manage. \u201cThat\u2019s an incredibly rare design to see on new merchandise! Let me see!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way, dork, this is mine!\u201d Kacchan says, holding the baseball cap up and just out of reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome <em>on</em>, Kacchan!\u201d Izuku whines, stretching out as far as he can, \u201cJust let me see it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust let me fucking talk to you first and then you can be a massive nerd!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we possibly have to talk about?\u201d Izuku asks, darting around behind Kacchan in an attempt to catch him off guard. It doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Kacchan says, looking him the eye and making him deflate. Oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Izuku concedes, \u201cthere\u2019s a stairwell over there.\u201d He gestures towards a pair of doors at the back of the room, and Kacchan grabs his hand and drags him towards them. \u201cWoah!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, where are you going?\u201d Kacchan\u2019s friend, Eijirou, calls after them.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk amongst yourselves!\u201d Kacchan calls back, pushing the doors open, pulling Izuku through, and letting them slam shut behind them. Izuku sits down on the stairs next to Kacchan, watching carefully as he places the coveted hat behind him, out of Izuku reach. \u201cIzuku, stop looking at the hat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Izuku lies, snapping his eyes back to Kacchan\u2019s very serious expression. His shoulders slump when he meets red eyes. \u201cKacchan\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kacchan says, holding Izuku\u2019s gaze, \u201cfor all the shit I did. I wanted to tell you that to your face.\u201d He swallows, clearing his throat a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026wanted to tell you that for a long time, actually. Pretty much since the day you left. But I couldn\u2019t find you, so\u2026yeah. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku sighs, hugging a knee to his chest. \u201cI\u2026thank you,\u201d he says, smiling a bit, \u201cI, uh, I figured you never meant it.\u201d He takes a deep breath, remembering that last damning argument that barely made up a tiny fraction of all his memories with Kacchan, most of them perfectly happy. In fact, he couldn\u2019t even remember what had caused the argument in the first place, nor did he much care to find out. \u201cI mean, we were just kids, we\u2019re bound to do dumb stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan exhales sharply, nodding a bit, \u201cSome of us more than others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not the one who broke three bones in one year,\u201d Izuku jokes. The tension in Kacchan\u2019s shoulders seems to relax when he chuckles. Izuku shuffles closer to him, bumping their thighs together. \u201cHey, seriously, it\u2019s okay. And thank you.\u201d Izuku smiles, taking in all of Kacchan\u2019s features. He\u2019s so beautiful it\u2019s unbelievable. \u201cMostly I\u2019m just glad to see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Kacchan says, but it\u2019s too late. Izuku\u2019s eyes are misting up.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really <em>sucked</em> when I had to leave without saying goodbye,\u201d Izuku warbled, sniffling loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kacchan says under his breath, pulling Izuku in for an unexpected hug, \u201cOkay. Shit, yeah. I\u2019m sorry for that one too. It really did suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku laughs through his tears, pressing his face against Kacchan\u2019s shirt. He\u2019s so warm, Izuku never wants to let go.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still such a snotty crier,\u201d Kacchan mutters, and Izuku pulls back to pout at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cMean, Kacchan!\u201d he frowns. \u201cI\u2019m having a lot of emotions right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are you not?\u201d Kacchan teases, cupping Izuku\u2019s cheek to wipe a tear away with his thumb. Izuku stills as soon as their skin touches, and Kacchan seems to do the same, eyes locked on Izuku\u2019s. The silence stretches on for a few long moments, then Kacchan coughs awkwardly and drops his hand to his lap, squeezing it into a loose fist. Izuku notices a few rings decorating his slender fingers and forgets to hesitate when he reaches out to inspect them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get these?\u201d he asks, studying the jewelry intently. One ring is a simple dark silver band, another is a more complicated pattern of vines coiling around Kacchan\u2019s pointer finger. \u201cI like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Kacchan says, \u201cThis one is my dad\u2019s.\u201d He wiggles his ring finger, which holds the simple dark band. \u201cAnd I think my friend gave me the other one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is Uncle Masaru, by the way?\u201d Izuku asks, looking up with a smile, \u201cAnd auntie. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine, I guess,\u201d Kacchan answers, \u201cWorking, whatever. How about Auntie Inko?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s great!\u201d Izuku grins, \u201cNow that I\u2019m moved out, she travels around England with my dad. She\u2019s having a lot of fun, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, good for her,\u201d Kacchan says, flexing his fingers. It\u2019s only then that Izuku realizes that he hasn\u2019t let go of Kacchan\u2019s hand, but instead interlaced their fingers on the ground between them. Which is embarrassing enough to make his cheeks flush, but what makes it even worse is that Kacchan really doesn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cSo, you\u2019re in school now, living on your own,\u201d Kacchan continues like there\u2019s nothing strange about them holding hands and sitting thigh to thigh, \u201cMechanical engineering\u2026it makes so much sense now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Izuku responds, realizing just how much he and Kacchan actually know about each other\u2019s adult lives despite not knowing who exactly those lives belonged to until just today. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re an analytical ass nerd, and I cannot fucking believe I didn\u2019t figure out who you were before,\u201d Kacchan says, \u201c<em>Small Might</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dynamight</em>,\u201d Izuku retorts, \u201cChemical engineering. You always did like blowing things up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I know what I like.\u201d Kacchan shrugs, smirking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still can\u2019t forgive you for all those times you blew up my mansions in Minecraft,\u201d Izuku recalls, furrowing his brows, \u201c<em>So</em> uncalled for. And that much TNT was not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut by god was it some damn beautiful destruction,\u201d Kacchan mocks with a deeper voice, clenching his fist to his chest with a dramatic flair.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the dork?\u201d Izuku teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely you,\u201d Kacchan says, grabbing the hat from beside him and shoving it onto Izuku\u2019s head, pulling it so low that Izuku could hardly see with all the hair in front of his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he protests, pushing the brim of the cap back and swiping at his hair with a pout, \u201cMean.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glances up to find Kacchan\u2019s face very close to his own, with the strangest expression. His ears are red again, his crimson eyes almost surprised as they rove over Izuku\u2019s face, catching on certain parts before landing on his eyes. The jewel ruby tone of his gaze is beautiful enough to drown in, and Izuku finds his own attention flitting between there and Kacchan\u2019s lips. Oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I used to have a massive crush on you,\u201d Izuku blurts, face burning, \u201cMight not be the\u2026right time to mention that, but\u2026yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Kacchan responds, gaze dropping hesitantly to Izuku\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2026uh\u2026\u201d Izuku stutters, leaning in a bit as Kacchan\u2019s fingers squeeze his.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kacchan breathes, closing the tiny distance between them. </p>\n<p>Izuku melts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Katsuki means to pull away after a few seconds, but he doesn\u2019t get more than a centimeter away before Izuku\u2019s hand is on the back of his neck, pulling him back in and kissing him deeply. Heart palpitations ensue. His entire body is buzzing at every little touch, his breath catching when Izuku digs his fingers into his hair. There\u2019s a sturdy hand gripping his waist. Fuck. This man seems intent on killing him.</p>\n<p>When they finally do break apart, Katsuki heaves in air like he\u2019s been drowning, because he might as well have been. Fucking hell.</p>\n<p>He slumps against the wall beside him, fighting a grin as he watches Izuku catch his own breath, freckled cheeks stained bright red. That stupid hat is pushed way up, and Katsuki leans over to fix it, making sure to adjust Izuku\u2019s hair out of his face. Izuku gives him an annoying little crooked grin for that, and before Katsuki can stop himself he\u2019s pulled the nerd in for another quick kiss, yanking the hat back over his eyes when he pulls away. </p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. Keep that thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, twisting the cap around so he\u2019s wearing it backwards. \u201cThanks, Kacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNerd,\u201d Katsuki grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm,\u201d Izuku hums happily, dropping his head onto Katsuki\u2019s shoulder and slipping his arms around his waist. Katsuki lets him, leaning back into him without really meaning to. \u201cOh, what\u2019s this?\u201d Izuku asks, his hand finding its way to the keychain on Katsuki\u2019s belt loop. \u201cStill into Mirko, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh,\u201d Katsuki mutters, resting his head on top of Izuku\u2019s. His stomach grumbles as Izuku starts spouting off random facts about Mirko, as is apparently still his habit. \u201cDe-Izuku,\u201d he starts, furrowing his brow, \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know. Can you rant about Mirko after I get something to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me whatever you want, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku answers, hooking his finger through Katsuki\u2019s belt loop. Katsuki\u2019s ears burn and he flicks Izuku in the nose. \u201cHey!\u201d Izuku laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m finding myself lunch,\u201d Katsuki says, nudging Izuku off him so he can stand. Izuku jumps to his feet beside him, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllow me to treat you, darling Kacchan,\u201d he says, offering out his hand with the other tucked behind his back, bowing his head slightly. Katsuki snorts, grabbing the outstretched hand and pulling Izuku in for yet another kiss, grinning smugly at his bright red cheeks and wide eyes. \u201cOh!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do owe me for the hat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk around after lunch,\u201d Izuku smiles.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a light knock on the doors to the stairway, making both of them startle. \u201cUh, Izuku?\u201d Uravity\u2019s voice calls through the door, \u201cWe have to go back out soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe right there!\u201d Izuku calls back, then turns to Katsuki with a smirk, \u201cOff to do celebrity famous person things, I guess. Give autographs, take selfies, be adored by all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSign people\u2019s foreheads,\u201d Katsuki adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, lots of foreheads,\u201d Izuku nods, \u201cPeople want to get it tattooed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want my autograph? I think that\u2019s what you just said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuy me a fucking sandwich and I\u2019ll give you <em>my</em> autograph, how about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>"
