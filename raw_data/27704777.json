I hope that you guys enjoy. This was fun to write.</p>\n<p>Posted 1/2/21</p>\n<p>Yet again a comment made me start having ideas so now there is this chapter. This chapter involves mentions of the Overhaul arc and Eri so if you haven't gotten to that part you might be the tiniest bit confused. Anyways hope you enjoy. :)</p>\n<p>Also just know that in this chapter Midoriya is in his civilian clothes.</p>\n<p>Posted 11/29/21</p>\n<p>Alas I have returned to add more to Angry Scary Midoriya after getting an idea I couldn't resist ;p</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Izuku had to learn it from someone, and who better than his own mother? A mother who wouldn't hesitate to do what it took to get her son back, with shape words and shape knives. Also, I love Inko who isn't afraid to use her quirk to hurt a bitch if needed (we stan an Inko who threaten people with a smile)</p>\n<p>Also even with his life in danger Izuku will not stand for someone insulting his mother. </p>\n<p>You can see why the league decided not to try to kidnap Izuku anymore. </p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this!</p>",
  "text": "<p>Midoriya was not known to be an angry person. Ever since he was little he learned to be nice and to smile even when angry from his mother. She told him it was important to know how to control your anger and use it when it truly mattered. Now Midoriya Inko had years of experience to know when she should truly be upset and let it be known. </p>\n<p>However, her son was not the same so even when he was bullied he didn\u2019t think that it was the time to be very angry and use it. But he made sure to watch how his mother would show her anger and to have mastered that ability. Even though he never did use it.</p>\n<p>So no one really ever saw Midoriya angry, not even Bakugou and if he did, then he would have never continued to call him Deku.</p>\n<p>Instead Midoriya was known to be one of the nicest people in class 1A. He was even referred to as a cinnamon roll, since he was so sweet to everyone. He was known as someone who loved their friends and would go beyond to help them. </p>\n<p>Although it seemed that they forgot how scary smart he was and how fierce he was in a fight.</p>\n<p> And people seemed to forget that he was like them and he could get angry, he did get angry. Even if he didn\u2019t show it.</p>\n<p>So least to say that class 1A and everyone who knew Midoriya did not know what to do in the situation that they were currently in. A couple of them were scared, not recognizing the look on Midoriya\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>But for context here is what happened:</p>\n<p>Everyone was in the common room, it was a Friday and many of the students were excited for the break that the weekend would bring. Also the opportunity to hang out with friends outside of a school setting. Least to say there was a lot of talking. All the while Midoriya was simply sitting and taking in the scene of his friends and classmates. He was happy, that is until he heard the resident pervert say something.</p>\n<p>It was something that Midoriya was used to.</p>\n<p> He heard as Mineta talked about a news story he read where a student had killed themself and how he felt bad, until he read that the student was quirkless.</p>\n<p> He continued to say that the student did the right thing opening up space for someone actually \u201cuseful\u201d who would contribute something to society. He even talked about how the article had said that the student had been baited by other students and Mineta thought those students did society a favor telling the quirkless kid to go kill themselves.</p>\n<p> Mineta said all this to Kaminari and Sero who looked very uncomfortable. Not listening to them when they tried to interrupt him and said he shouldn't say things like that. Mineta didn't seem to care and went on sharing his opinion.</p>\n<p>All the while, totally unaware that his classmate, Midoriya, was someone who was quirkless and had been suicide baited so many times in his life. Someone who had been bullied and bruised and scarred by classmates who deemed it their responsibility to remind the quirkless boy of how worthless he was. To tell him that he should do everyone a favor and die.</p>\n<p>Midoriya was angry. He didn\u2019t need his mother to tell him that this was the time to be angry and do something about it. So in Midoriya fashion he did. Taking on the dead-eyed stare that he had only seen a handful of times on his mother's face and he walked up behind Mineta who was in front of the other two uncomfortable boys.</p>\n<p>It was obvious when Sero and Kaminari took notice of him, how they paled and seemed to want anything but to be there. Meanwhile Mineta was still speaking until he finally saw the looks on the boys\u2019 faces and asked what was wrong. Then Mineta turned around.</p>\n<p>The room was quiet, everyone taking notice of the shift of mood in the room. They watched as the class 1A cinnamon roll seemed to be the source of such suffocating awful aura. They watched as, along with his dead eyes, he smiled a sickenly sweet smile that was anything but innocent (also something he has seen from his mother).</p>\n<p> Mineta shrieked when he saw Midoriya smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cMineta,\u201d he said in a sweet voice that at the same time seemed to drag a knife against your skin and made you want to run away,</p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019ve been a real pain for this class especially to the girls who have <i>repeatedly</i> asked you to respect them and their privacy. While you have completely ignored that. And I thought you should have been kicked out a long time ago because in my eyes you are not fit to be a hero. <i>But</i> Aizawa-sensei and the other teachers thought you had potential so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d </p>\n<p>Midoriya paused and looked into Mineta\u2019s eyes in silence and then spoke again.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>But</b> now having just heard what you said, I have come to the conclusion that you have absolutely zero potential and have no <b>fucking idea</b> what you\u2019re talking about. It is clear to me that you <b>cannot</b> be a hero. So unless you want me to do something that I might<i> regret</i>, you are going to go to Aizawa-sensei and tell him what you said,<b> all of it</b>. And deal with the consequences. Unless...\u201d </p>\n<p>Midoriya crouched down to be at eye level with Mineta and smiled again ,\u201d<b>you want me to </b>\u201d</p>\n<p>Still crouched and smiling, Midoriya watched as a dangerously pale Mineta stumbled backwards and out of the dorm building\u2019s doors, supposedly to go tell Aizawa what he had said. The suffocating aura still there.</p>\n<p>Then it was gone. Midoriya sighed, face back to normal, dead eyes and sickening smile gone. He got up from his crouched position, turned around and walked past everyone and went upstairs to his room.</p>\n<p>The eyes of his silent classmates watched him go into the elevator and the elevator doors closed before they dared let themselves breathe normally again.</p>\n<p>\u201cD-did you guys see that? I didn\u2019t just imagine that, right?\u201d Kaminari asked, looking at the rest of his classmates. Everyone nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya was angry\u201d Mina said in disbelief, \u201cand he never gets angry\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you guys forget that he\u2019s like us?\u201d Sero responded, \u201cof course he gets angry, everyone gets angry. I guess he's just really good at hiding it\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I guess so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>That was the general thought everyone was having in the common room. They were reminded that Midoriya was in fact a regular person who could get angry. But they couldn't get the image of Midoriya\u2019s face out of their mind. Or how they felt like they couldn't breathe and how they wanted to run when Midoriya had smiled and spoke. </p>\n<p>The sunshine boy of class 1A was scary when he was angry.</p>\n<p>It was a Friday. So it was perfectly logical for Aizawa to think that he could finally take a nap without any interruptions considering that the school week was over and there was nothing important going on.</p>\n<p>But logic seemed to go out the window when it came to his students. And now here he was with an out of breath student who looked particularly pale and was shaking as if they had just seen a ghost or some other frightening creature.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it Mineta?\u201d he asked and could tell that he was going to have a headache for being so abruptly woken up by what seemed like a student practically running into his door.</p>\n<p>He waited for his student to catch their breath. Once he was breathing normally Mineta spoke. </p>\n<p>\u201cI-I uh have to tell you about something I said earlier,\u201d the boy said nervously.</p>\n<p>Aizawa raised an eyebrow curious, \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mineta gulped and looked side to side as if looking for someone but there was no one there, \u201dY-yeah and it isn\u2019t good a-and you\u2019ll be angry but I <b>have</b> to tell you\u201d </p>\n<p>Aizawa\u2019s curiosity grew especially at the tone that Mineta took when he said that he had to tell him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo on Mineta.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Mineta did although very hesitantly. Obviously something was making him feel like he shouldn\u2019t say anything but there seemed to be something more pushing him to speak. He told the pro underground hero what he had said regarding quirkless people. How he had read an article about a quirkless student that killed themself and that he thought they had done the right thing since they did not contribute to society. And how he thought the people who had baited the quirkless student to kill themself had done something useful.</p>\n<p>Throughout his whole retelling Aizawa\u2019s eyes became sharp and Mineta tripped over his words more and his eyes went everywhere except onto his teacher\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Once he was finished Mineta actually breathed a sigh of relief which Aizawa thought was peculiar considering that the boy was in a lot of trouble now that he had told him what he had done.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all Mineta I am disappointed in you and we will be having a meeting with Principal Nedzu along with you parents as well.\u201d Aizawa paused and sighed bringing a hand up to his temple, a headache painfully there. \u201cAnd second of all why did you come here and tell me what you said. I would have thought that one of your classmates would have told me, not you.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Aizawa had said the second part he saw that Mineta once again got nervous and looked around him.</p>\n<p>Again there was no one there.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I just <b>had</b> to okay! If I didn\u2019t <b>he</b> was going to do something!\u201d Mineta said, as if that explained everything. But that only made Aizawa more confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mineta looked like he was about to pass out and his eyes frantically looked around his surroundings. Then he took a step closer to Aizawa and said something in a way that Aizawa had heard pros utter the names of villains.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Midoriya</b>\u201d</p>\n<p>----------------------</p>\n<p>Back in the common room everyone was chatting although there was a noticeable difference in the air compared to what it had been before a certain someone terrified everyone and a purple haired boy had run out of the dorm doors.</p>\n<p>And the atmosphere changed again when their homeroom teacher, Aizawa-sensei, suddenly appeared with Mineta who looked like he was about to collapse.</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa-sensei what are you doing here?\u201d Iida asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to figure out what the hell is going on. Why was it Mineta who came to me instead of any of you?\u201d</p>\n<p>At that question there was a tangible silence in the air. Everyone had seemed to hold their breath. </p>\n<p>It was Tokoyami who broke the silence, \u201cSensei it was Midoriya who told Mineta to go to you and confess his sins\u201d he paused, \u201cand he did so with anger in his heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tokoyami must have taken the silence and the look on Aizawa\u2019s face as an invitation to explain further. </p>\n<p>The bird headed boy took a step closer to his teacher, \u201cSensei there was a darkness in the air when Midoriya spoke to Mineta. He sucked the life out of the room and had told Mineta that if he did not go to you himself that he would do something he would possibly regret. It was an ultimatum that Mineta dare not question as he ran out to find you as you can see\u2026Even dark shadow will still not come out.\u201d the boy said, putting a hand on his chest.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Aizawa was in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Midoriya?</p>\n<p>Midoriya was the one who told Mineta to go to him? He was the one who made Mineta so scared that he kept looking around as if waiting for something to come out of the shadows? </p>\n<p>Midoriya was the one that seemed to make his classmates stop breathing when he asked about what was going on? That boy was the one who Tokoyami spoke about in such a manner that only seemed to be fitting for a horror book?</p>\n<p>Aizawa looked around the room at his other students and was only met with nods of agreement. There was no one to contradict what had been said. Not even Bakugou who was surprisingly silent.</p>\n<p>All of this was because Midoriya got angry?</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that there was a ding from the elevator and out stepped Midoriya who paused when he saw everyone was looking at him.</p>\n<p>Once his eyes landed on Aizawa the boy seemed to brighten up,\u201d Oh sensei you\u2019re here! So Mineta told you about what he said earlier, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Green eyes landed on Mineta who seemed to stop breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Midoriya he did and he will be dealing with the consequences promptly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Midorya smiled at his teacher\u2019s response, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Thank you Sensei.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aizawa nodded but spoke again asking a question, \u201cI was told that it was you who told Mineta to tell me what he said. How exactly did you get him to listen to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Around the room Midoriya\u2019s classmates stiffened.</p>\n<p>Midoriya looked sheepish and rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cOh well I-\u201d he said before he was interrupted.</p>\n<p>It seemed that with Aizawa there Mineta felt brave enough to interrupt the green haired boy angrily.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou <i>threatened</i> me and were being all creepy!! And why did you even get angry? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m wrong and it had nothing to do with you! Why don\u2019t you just mind your business?\u201d Mineta yelled at Midoriya from behind Aizawa who was angry by Mineta\u2019s outburst and how the boy was seemingly trying to defend what he had said earlier.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Aizawa had turned to face Mineta and turned on his quirk to show his anger. After a moment he saw the boy pale but he wasn\u2019t looking at him. He saw that Mineta was looking at something behind him and when he turned back he saw Midoriya. </p>\n<p>And he finally understood why Mineta had said Midoriya\u2019s name the way he did earlier.</p>\n<p>Midoriya was looking at Mineta but his sheepish expression was no longer there. Instead it had been replaced with dead eyes that seemed to look right through you but also also the darkest parts of yourself.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t even looking directly at Aizawa and yet the pro hero froze. There was this suffocating aura that made it hard to breathe much less move.</p>\n<p>In the back of his head was the familiar warning for him to <b>run</b> that he would get in encounters with certain villains in the dark of the night.. </p>\n<p>But this wasn\u2019t a villain. This was his student. A student he even affectionately called Problem Child. </p>\n<p>But he did not recognize that same student in those eyes, those dead eyes. A face that no longer had the smile he was so used to see in his classroom.</p>\n<p>And then he blinked and when he opened his eyes it was gone.</p>\n<p>The aura, the warnings, and the dead eyes.</p>\n<p>And no one said anything. Aizawa looked back at Mineta who had no expression on his face anymore and didn\u2019t seem to be angry anymore either.</p>\n<p>Feeling uncomfortable Aizawa broke the silence, \u201cAlright, Mineta you are already in trouble so no more of that. And Midoriya\u201d -he looked at MIdoriya who titled his head with a question in his eyes, eyes that had warmth and light- \u201cnext time just tell one of the teachers. What if next time they don\u2019t listen to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment Aizawa could have sworn he saw <i>something</i> in Midoriya\u2019s eyes but it was too quick to catch. Then Midoriya nodded, \u201cYes Aizawa-sensei\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Now it\u2019s getting late so you guys need to start getting ready for bed or whatever it is you do when you should be sleeping\u201d Aziawa said, which seemed to break everyone out of whatever state they were in.</p>\n<p>After he received multiple \u2018yes sensei\u2019 Aizawa started to walk to the dorm doors.</p>\n<p>And when he looked back he saw Midoriya in the elevator with a glass of water. Probably what he had come down for in the first place.</p>\n<p>Once the elevator doors closed he looked at the rest of his students and heard them as they started up their conversations again.</p>\n<p>Then he heard Kaminari say something that made him pause.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank god he didn\u2019t smile again. When he did before that was creepy as fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah dude, I never want to see Midoriya angry again. He\u2019s terrifying like that.\u201d Kirishima responded.</p>\n<p>And with that Aizawa exited the dorms, trying to imagine a smile added to the dead eyes he had seen on the face of Izuku Midoriya.</p>\n<p>It was not long until Aizawa got to see Midoriya's dead eyes accompanied by a smile that came nowhere near what he had tried imagining.</p>\n<p>One could think the smile was sweet for a moment but would have to be deranged to think it was anything near innocent. Especially when it was paired with eyes that had no light and an aura as suffocating as the one he was giving off.</p>\n<p>But of course, there was a reason that Izuku Midoriya was donning this visage.</p>\n<p>Because at the moment Izuku Midoriya was among villains. And in his arms was someone that he would protect with his life.</p>\n<p>Eri.</p>\n<p>Somehow a group of villains knew about Eri and had attacked where she was while Midoriya had been visiting her.</p>\n<p>A crucial mistake on their part.</p>\n<p>At the first sign of danger Midoriya had scooped up Eri gently and secured her against him.</p>\n<p>Only a second later did one villain appear in Eri\u2019s room and was met with Deku's foot in their face, along with the power of One for All sending them back and into a wall unconscious.</p>\n<p>Midoriya was unapologetic and kept moving while keeping an eye out. Midoriya knew that Aizawa was somewhere around with some other pro heroes so he made his way to where he thought they were.</p>\n<p>Along the way he came across another villain in the hallway who tried to stab him but he jumped on the wall and used it to land behind them. When they turned around Midoriya simply roundhouse kicked them in the face causing them to hit their head against the hallway wall.</p>\n<p>In Midorya\u2019s mind the head was the best shot at incapacitating them quickly. He didn\u2019t want to spend too much fighting while he held Eri in his arms.</p>\n<p>He didn't want any villains getting their hands in Eri. She was finally able to smile and laugh and he didn't want anyone taking that away from her.</p>\n<p>While he was making his way to where he thought the heroes were there was a series of explosions and Deku ended up running into a clearing with rubble surrounding it. Along with the rest of the villains.</p>\n<p>.\"Oh look Bari, seems that we don't have to look for the girl after all. This kid brought her right to us,\" one of the villains said.</p>\n<p>Midoriya's grip on Eri tightened. He didn't say anything but his eyes went over the two villains in front of him, noting their appearances and possible quirks and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>\"Kid hand over the girl and maybe I won't break your arms,\" said the same man who spoke earlier and stepped forward letting their hands enlarge and cracked their knuckles.</p>\n<p>\n<i> An enlargement quirk probably along with increased strength. Most likely close combat, keep your distance. </i>\n</p>\n<p>When Midoriya didn't move the man continued, \"Come on now, unless you want me to break the girl's arms instead,\" he said darkly.</p>\n<p>Midoriya's eyes sharpened.</p>\n<p>The other villain, Bari, who was standing off to the side started to laugh, \"Ooo someone looks mad.\"</p>\n<p>In the corner of his eyes Midoriya saw Aizawa and the other heroes arrive. Bari noticed them too and sent what looked like spears made out of a black jagged material their way when they tried to approach. They also backed up behind a piece of concrete to hide from Aizawa's view.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Aizawa couldn't see the villain that threw spears at them. He couldn't erase their quirk and the other heroes were hesitant to approach. </p>\n<p>But there in the middle was his student along with Eri held closely to his chest.</p>\n<p>There was another villain who seemed to have an enlargement quirk and Aizawa used his quirk to erase it. But the moment he did he saw a spear headed his way so he had to dodge and look away.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Dammit, I can't keep that guy's quirk erased and dodge at the same time.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Erasherhead tried to keep it erased but it was futile when only a second later he would have to look away in order to not get stabbed by spears coming his way.</p>\n<p>And the other heroes were no better. They too were dogging the sharp weapons coming their way.</p>\n<p>They couldn't make their way to Midoriya or Eri.</p>\n<p>The villain with the enlargement quirk laughed, \"Look kid, the heroes won't save you now so why don't you just hand over the girl. Like I said maybe I won't break your arms.\"</p>\n<p>Midoriya didn't say anything.</p>\n<p>\"Okay so I might break your arms anyway, but it won't be too bad. I promise\" he said smiling.</p>\n<p>When Midoriya didn't make any move to hand Eri over the villain stopped smiling and growed in frustration.</p>\n<p>\"Alright kid. When I get my hands on you I'm going to break all 4 of your limbs for trying to be a hero and then I\u2019m gonna snap the girl's arms in two. Not like she needs to be in perfect condition to use.\" He said darkly.</p>\n<p>Once the villain said that Aizawa felt a familiar aura in the air that seemed to make everyone freeze. </p>\n<p>When he looked at Midoriya, he saw those dead eyes along with the smile that Kaminari must have been talking about.</p>\n<p>Aizawa felt a chill run up his spine and when he looked at the other heroes he saw that they were all looking at Midoriya. The spears that they had been dodging seemingly stopped.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Eri was in the same position that she had been when she was rescued from Overhaul. Except now she had better control of her quirk and she had no doubt that Midoriya would keep her safe.</p>\n<p>When he had scooped her up and held her close she wasn't scared. Not even when Deku kicked the villains in their face.</p>\n<p>He was protecting her, she knew that.</p>\n<p>And when the bad man with the big hands threatened Deku and her, she didn't feel scared. Deku would never let that bad man get his hands on her. He wouldn't let go of her where he held her close to his chest.</p>\n<p>But the bad man didn't know that and kept making threats and even said he was going to break her arms. She didn't like that and tightened her grip on Deku's shirt.</p>\n<p>That's when she felt it. There was a change in the air.</p>\n<p>Surrounding her was the familiar green lightning that her hero Deku had whenever he was using his quirk. And there was a pressure in the air that she found familiar. She remembered that the pressure was like the one that was there when Deku was fighting Overhaul.</p>\n<p>She knew that Deku was angry. But not angry at her no. He was angry at the bad men.</p>\n<p>When she looked up at Deku's face she saw that he was really angry. But she still wasn't scared.</p>\n<p>How could she?</p>\n<p>Deku was her hero.</p>\n<p>And when Deku spoke and she saw the other heroes on the side look scared she smiled and thought it was funny.</p>\n<p>She didn't know how they could be scared of Deku.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Eraserhead and everyone else except Eri felt as if there was a knife dragging against their skin when Midoriya spoke.</p>\n<p>The villains took a step back when Midoriya's voice hit their ears. All they wanted to do was run when he opened his mouth.</p>\n<p>\" You aren't going to lay <b>one hand on her,</b>\" he said, tilting his head to the side and staring at them with two black holes for eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Because if you do\u2026 <b>I will break every single bone in your body.</b>\" </p>\n<p>The villains looked at Midoriya and they couldn't look away. Even though they wished to do anything other than look at him any longer.</p>\n<p>The reflection of green lightning that surrounded Midoriya in his eyes was the only light in them. And his smile was feral. His teeth seemed sharper and he kept looking at them. Daring them to get any closer to him or the innocent girl in his arms. </p>\n<p>When Midoriya took a step forward the villains took a step back.</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that Aizawa took the opportunity to go to the villain who had been hiding and throwing spears and captured them in his capture weapon.</p>\n<p>At the commotion the other villain turned their head towards Aizawa but didn't get a chance to do anything. Aizawa could only watch as his student's foot connected with the villain\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>It was when the villain with the enlargement quirk was rendered unconscious that the pressure in the air disappeared and when Aizawa looked at Midoriya it was to see the boy with tears in his eyes smiling at Eri and hugging her while she laughed and patted his back.</p>\n<p>Eraserhead looked back at the group of heroes to the side who looked like they were taking their first deep breath after being submerged underwater. </p>\n<p>He motioned for one of them to come over to secure the unconscious villain.The hero that came was Manual, the hero who Iida had interned for in Hosu.</p>\n<p>When he walked over the Aizawa he looked apprehensive at Midoriya, \"Eraserhead...what <b>was </b>that?\"</p>\n<p>Aizawa only raised an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\"That was Deku,\" he said, using Midoriya's hero name, \"protecting Eri.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes I know that, but he was\u2026\" Manual seemed to have trouble picking a word, \"that was <i>terrifying</i>. I have only felt the way I did just now in the presence of a villain.\"</p>\n<p>Manual heard Eraserhead hum, \"Then we should be so lucky that Deku is on our side.\" And he walked away with the spear throwing villain secured.</p>\n<p>Manual looked at Eraserhead\u2019s receding back and then back to Midoriya who wasn\u2019t anywhere near to the chilling image he was only movement ago..</p>\n<p>The boy with dead eyes, a feral smile, a sweet grating voice, and green lightning while holding Eri who looked calm and comfortable in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust what did you teach him Eraserhead?\u201d Manual called out to Eraserhead.</p>\n<p>Aizawa turned back to face Manual with a serious face, \u201cI\u2019ve taught Midoriya a lot of things... But I did <i>not</i> teach him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a time that the league had attempted to kidnap Izuku Midoriya multiple times. But after several \u2018instances,\u2019 that desire was quickly extinguished and the attempts came to a standstill. However, there were those that were unaware of the change in the decision and with old information looked at the green-haired teen walking along a particularly empty street with greedy eyes.<br>\n___</p>\n<p>Izuku was running errands when he suddenly felt a prick in his neck. Seconds later, as his legs seemed to lose strength did he feel someone wrap an arm around his shoulder. When he looked he saw an unfamiliar face with a sinister grin and using the little strength he had left he made sure to press the buttons on his phone in an already determined pattern. </p>\n<p>And with that, he lost consciousness as his phone sent a message to both his mother and homeroom teacher.</p>\n<p>________________</p>\n<p>Aizawa was in the middle of talking to Nedzu who was gathering a group of heroes to go get Midoriya when the door opened suddenly. When he turned around he saw Inko Midoriya.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she said looking at the two of them straight on with determined eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any less,\u201d Nedzu said hanging up the phone. \u201cThe signal from your son\u2019s phone is still active so we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then as quickly as she arrived she left. When she did Aizawa quickly turned to Nedzu. \u201cAre you sure she can come with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nedzu seemed to quirk an eyebrow at the hero without saying anything. </p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\n___</p>\n<p>The heroes looked oddly at the short, stout, sweet-looking woman who stood with them outside of the old restaurant that for some reason where Izuku\u2019s phone signal was coming from.</p>\n<p>Before Aizawa headed in he felt a slight tug on his capture weapon and turned around. </p>\n<p>Green eyes looked at him, telling him a number of things without needing to say a word.</p>\n<p>He nodded back at her before turning back in heading in.<br>\n___</p>\n<p>The restaurant was really on its last legs in terms of being a structurally sound building. A few rats scurried in front of the heroes and there were absolutely no lights on. Handheld flashlights lit their way as they made their way deeper inside the building, looking for any sign for the UA student or the person who took him.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Ectoplasm came across someone but the unidentified individual was quick to run, throwing things in their path as they chased after him. They chased him all the way back into what looked like the main kitchen where there were stoves and various shelves still filled with old rusting cooking materials. There was even a wall where there still were knives hanging off of them.</p>\n<p>And in front of that wall was a man holding Izuku Midoriya in a tight grip with a knife pressed against his skin.</p>\n<p>The man was completely surrounded by Eraserhead, Vlad King, Ectoplasm, and Midnight but held the upper hand with the teen as a hostage.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Fuck.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Aizawa looked over at his student. The boy looked weak on his feet, his skin was pale and sweaty when the light from the flashlight managed to light the room somewhat. It looked like he had a fever while his eyes were still bright. Eyes that looked at all the heroes with dilated pupils. Aizawa had a small worry about if his student had been drugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya are you alright?\u201d he asked taking a step forward but he stopped when the knife glinted in the light. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t move if I were you. Would be a shame if my hand happened to slip,\u201d the kidnapper said before pressing the knife harder against the boy\u2019s neck and they could see red appear on the dirty blade.</p>\n<p>At that, no one dared to take another step forward and the hero closest to the back let Nedzu know outside that it was a hostage situation. Midnight\u2019s quirk would have been the best bet but took time to disperse and would not be quick enough before the man would have slit Izuku\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>There was a tense silence before the sound of a door opened in the distance and small steps could be heard. Although it didn\u2019t sound like someone anyone knew. When the steps got closer, a light was pointed at the entrance of the kitchen and showed Inko Midoriya who stood primly with her hands clasped in front of her in the dark. </p>\n<p>Seconds later, two men came behind her out of breath. They seemed to startle at the tense atmosphere but looked at Inko and back at Eraserhead. \u201cSorry, we tried to stop her bu-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I came anyway,\u201d Inko said to Eraserhead. Then she turned her attention back to the man who held a knife against her son\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>Her eyes took in the man\u2019s tall stature and specifically stayed focused on the knife that seemed to cut deep enough for blood to start to trickle out of the cut. </p>\n<p>The man looked at her with amusement and back at the boy he had hostage. He chuckled. \u201cAw well look at who it is kid, your mom\u2019s come to your rescue. More like a fat pig to the slaughter from the look of it though wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p>\n<p>At those words and clear insult, Izuku\u2019s eyes sharpened and he glared at the man. \u201c<b>Shut the fuck up,</b>\u201d he gritted out. The man chuckled more while pressing the knife harder into his neck which made more blood come out, Izuku didn\u2019t seem to care.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, everyone else stilled at the action and the sight of more blood.</p>\n<p>Eraserhead watched as his student\u2019s mother\u2019s eye seemed to look behind the man, at the wall full of different knives.</p>\n<p>Then when she spoke it was calm but cold. \u201cLet my son go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man laughed before letting his smile drop and looking coldly at her. \u201cOr what bitch? You can\u2019t do anything or I\u2019ll slit his throat like a cow in front of his pig mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>At those words, there\u2019s a shift in the air and the heroes watch as a knife was suddenly pulled from the wall and stopped at the back of the man\u2019s neck, the sharpest point dug into his skin. It was as if someone invisible was holding it there in midair against his neck. The heroes looked at each other to see who could have done that, but no one had a quirk like that. The only person who could do something like that who came to Aizawa\u2019s mind was the civilian who stood with them in the dark kitchen. </p>\n<p>From the side where Midnight was, she could see that blood welled up from where the knife was digging into the man\u2019s neck. And the man could feel as that drop of blood went down his back.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Inko Midoriya was smiling. Her eyes seem to glow while her smile looked innocent but sharp, just like the two knives that were cutting into someone\u2019s skin. And when she spoke, her words were just as cutting.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be easy for me to pull this knife to cut into your skin and past the bone that protects your spinal cord. I could do it easily right now.\u201d - Inko brought up a hand and gestured her finger in a way that could be used to beckon someone to come closer - \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go of my son I can even use the cleaver that\u2019s behind your head to decapitate it, the knife at your neck is too small to do that right now,\u201d she said as if she were only slightly disappointed by that fact.</p>\n<p>The man laughed nervously at her words. He glanced at the surrounding heroes with an awkward smile. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare in front of all these heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Inko\u2019s smile got bigger everyone except her son seemed to freeze. Eraserhead wasn\u2019t even sure if she was serious or not, but he was leaning towards the more bloody choice.</p>\n<p>And it was a standstill as more blood trickled from Izukus\u2019s neck and the knife still pressing at the back of the man\u2019s neck. He kept staring at the woman\u2019s green eyes that seemed to bore into him. Her smile which seemed mockingly sweet made his stomach turn in discomfort. Then when he glanced to look down at her son he froze at the toxic green eyes that looked at him, identical to his mother. The pressure that she had given off felt heavier.</p>\n<p>The pain from the back of his neck felt more present and he thought about how quickly she could make the cleaver cut through his neck. If this woman had the gall to come in unarmed and stand before him looking as calm as she did and threaten him in front of all these heroes...he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be fast enough to escape if he didn\u2019t do as she said.<br>\n___</p>\n<p>When the man dropped the knife Izuku easily slipped out his grasp while the man seemed to collapse on the floor. Eraserhead saw how quickly Inko\u2019s smile changed to one that seemed less suffocating when her son was now in her arms and she fretted over the cut at his neck. She was even crying and was soon joined by her son who tried to calm her down, they both were failing at stopping their tears.</p>\n<p>The underground hero looked at the kidnapper Vlad King was now securing with cuffs. The man in question looked pale. </p>\n<p>Aizawa couldn\u2019t blame him. Inko Midoriya was quite a sight to see, it reminded him of his student when he had gotten angry. And with what he had just witnessed, the question of where Izuku had gotten such a terrifying demeanor when angry was no longer a mystery.</p>"
