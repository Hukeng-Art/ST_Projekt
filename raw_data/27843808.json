I'll try my best not to let you down with the rest of the story!</p>\n<p>The suspense is over! Sorry for the wait, this chapter ended up being a lot longer than I had originally planned. Thanks so much for Kudos and comments! I hope you enjoy my story!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed my story, I had a lot of fun writing it! I\u2019ve had several people ask me about a sequel. I hadn\u2019t planned on a second one but with how it ended, I\u2019m thinking about it. Unfortunately I don\u2019t really have any ideas for it so I\u2019d be more than happy for some suggestions. I do know I want to include Kate, Alfred, Harper, Cullen, and possibly Julia and Luke.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<span>There was a buzz of energy in the Watchtower, and it wasn\u2019t just from the Flash. Today, the Justice League was having a \u201cBring your kid to work\u201d day. Green Lantern Jordan had jokingly suggested it after Superman had mentioned that many of the Leaguers had proteges and that he thought they would enjoy meeting each other. The Flash and Wonder Woman had instantly loved the idea and began planning the event.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hal and J\u2019onn had been on monitor duty when everyone started to arrive. Wonder Woman, who loved children immensely, made sure she was there to greet everyone who arrived. Superman was next with both of the Superboys, Conner and Jonathan. Next Black Canary and Green Arrow arrived with Artemis and Arsenal. Everyone was coming early, even Flash and Kid Flash were surprising on time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s move into the cafeteria,\u201d Diana suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s getting too crowded here in the hall to wait for everyone to come.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The young heroes rushed ahead, chatting amongst themselves. Diana couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when she saw the Flash\u2019s nephew speed ahead of everyone, only to turn back around when he noticed he left everyone behind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI see someone\u2019s excited,\u201d Diana teased Barry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Barry laughed. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t stopped talking about it all week. It was actually starting to get annoying.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d Diana stated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but I do know that he annoyed his best friend so much about it that he refused to talk to Kid anymore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Diana laughed. \u201cHis friend knows him as Kid Flash?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s a hero too. I\u2019ve met him a couple of times now, he\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Barry replied. \u201cWell I guess he\u2019s not really a kid, though. He\u2019s about the same age as Wally.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd a good hero?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Flash paused before continuing, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bring it up yet, but I was thinking about introducing him to the League, hopefully having it lead him to joining the League.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Wonder Woman could reply, she heard the zeta tube start up. </span>\n<em>\n<span>More guests to Welcome! </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cPlease excuse me Flash, but don\u2019t think this conversation is over.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d The man sped off to the cafeteria. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Probably to get into the tasty treats before they\u2019re all gone. </span>\n</em>\n<span>When she re-entered the hall, she paused in surprise when she saw who it was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWonder Woman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2026 I did not expect to see you today.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Hal said he was not coming.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just here to update the computer systems with a newly designed software program.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The dark knight walked briskly by her and past the entrance to the cafeteria, unemotional as his words he had just spoken to her. </span>\n<em>\n<span>He made no comment about today\u2019s event. In fact, he\u2019s never even mentioned it at all at any time, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Diana thought as she returned to the cafeteria.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Seeing that no one followed her, Superman asked, \u201cWho just came?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe get to meet him too?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAwesome!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Barry looked confused, \u201cI thought you said Batman told you he wasn\u2019t coming, GL?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Diana glared at Hal, who at least had the decency to look nervous. \u201cHal, did you inform Batman of today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hal didn\u2019t answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause he made no mention of today\u2019s event when I spoke to him just now. And now that I think about it, he hasn\u2019t once said a word about us bringing the kids here, leading me to believe that no one told him about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHal!\u201d Barry shouted, smacking the green lantern on the back of the head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d He said incredulously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were supposed to tell Batman!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t think he would have been okay with this, let alone come! He\u2019s always so grumpy and gloomy! And it's not like he would have anyone to bring! Nothing about him really screams \u2018child-friendly\u2019!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s mean!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd yet I don\u2019t hear you disagreeing with me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman is a member of this team,\u201d Diana intervened, \u201cand he should be treated as such. Which does not include purposely excluding him from league events and lying about it. I will go inform him now, since you didn\u2019t care to.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Without another word, she spun around and marched out of the room, leaving Flash and Superman to glare at the green lantern.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>Bruce usually didn\u2019t have much to do on weekend mornings. He tried to always clear his schedule those mornings to spend time with the kids since they didn\u2019t have school or work. But, unfortunately all his kids already had plans for the one morning he didn\u2019t have <em> any </em> cases or WE work to do. He was waiting on lab results for all of his cases, and Tim and Barbara had created <b>\u00a0</b> computer systems to analyze the results so he didn\u2019t even have to be there when the results came in <b>.</b> Even Alfred and Selina had plans.</p>\n<p>When he came downstairs for breakfast all of his kids were present, even Jason, Dick, and Steph who didn\u2019t live in the manor. When he suggested for all of them to do something together, each of his kids said they already had plans for the day. Tim, Steph, Cass, and Duke were going to the mall; Damian wanted to go to the library to work on a school project; Jason had surprisingly offered to give his youngest brother a ride and even more surprisingly, Damian accepted the offer; and Dick was hanging out with Wally.</p>\n<p>Tim, seeing that his father looked a bit disappointed, said that they wouldn\u2019t take too long at the mall. They could do something once they got back. In the meantime, Bruce could go to the watchtower to install the new computer system update he, Tim, and Barbara created.</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s where Batman was, sitting at the computers of the Watchtower, the secret headquarters to the Justice League. When he arrived, Diana looked a little surprised to see him, but he ignored it. He wouldn\u2019t admit it, but he was a little upset about not being able to spend time with his kids. He quickly explained to her that he had some updates to install on the computers and left her.</p>\n<p>Bruce didn\u2019t really mind working at the watchtower. In fact he felt like he got more work done there than anywhere else, probably because he didn\u2019t have any children interrupting him constantly, Bruce loved his kids, he really did, but sometimes they were just exhausting.</p>\n<p>While the tower had its perks, it had its downsides, like adults acting like children, which was so much worse. He could hear Flash and Green Lantern bickering with each other in the other room. He couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying, and since he didn\u2019t feel like socializing with anyone, he ignored them. Soon their bickering stopped, and Diana walked into the room.</p>\n<p>Bruce really didn\u2019t feel like socializing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBatman,\u201d Diana spoke to him, \u201cI have just been made aware that you were not informed of today\u2019s event.\u201d Batman didn\u2019t know what she was talking about so he remained silent to let her continue. \u201cMembers of the league are hosting a \u2018Bring your child to work day\u2019 for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Batman grunted in response, thinking of his own kids. He could practically see the chaos they would ensue by being there, especially since the League was unaware he had children. Bruce knew he wasn\u2019t good at things like small talk and chatting, mostly because he didn\u2019t really know what to say in response to people. So he tried to avoid situations like that. But his kids somehow always managed to throw Bruce into them, leaving him feeling awkward and embarrassed. Bruce had a suspicion that they thought it was fun to embarrass him. He once told Selina this, but she just laughed at him and called him a \u201cparanoid old bat\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are\u2026 okay with this?\u201d Wonder Woman asked.</p>\n<p>Batman sighed as he paused from his work for a moment before resuming with updating the computer system. \u201cAn activity such as this will build trust among the league, which will result in better teamwork.\u201d Bruce knew from experience from each time a new kid was brought into the family. The more they trusted each other outside the costume, the more trust they had in the field. \u201cBesides, Superman is the only one with a child, and it\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t brought him here before.\u201d Well, the only one, other than himself, with a child born. Both Queen Mera of Atlantis and Iris West-Allen were pregnant.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, many of the members brought their proteges,\u201d Diana informed him. \u201cSuperman also brought Kon-El; my sisters Donna and Cassandra will be arriving soon; Green Arrow and Black Canary brought Arsenal and Artemis; and the Flash brought his nephew Kid Flash.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce froze. <em> They wouldn\u2019t </em>, he thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone has been looking forward to this. Flash said that his nephew hasn\u2019t stopped talking about it meeting the Justice League all week. I am sorry that you were not informed of this sooner.\u201d Diana said apologetically.</p>\n<p>Bruce knew for a fact that Dick had been on the phone with Kid Flash on Thursday night. Dick was supposed to be practicing defensive maneuvers with Damian but had instead answered a phone call from the speedster, resulting in Damian complaining to Bruce about it.</p>\n<p><em> Who am I kidding? Of course they would. I </em> know <em> that they love to embarrass me, despite whatever Cat has to say about it. </em> Batman abruptly stood up and shut down what he was doing. \u201cI need to go.\u201d He left the room before Diana could utter a single word.</p>\n<p><span>Wally was buzzing with excitement, literally. He just met Wonder Woman and Superman. Sure he was an adult man, but it was </span><em><span>Wonder Woman </span></em><span>and</span><em><span> Superman</span></em><span>!</span> <span>When Diana left to go inform Batman of today\u2019s event, Aquaman arrived with a young man following behind him.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArthur,\u201d J\u2019onn greeted, his deep voice rumbling, having taken over as the welcoming community since Diana left. \u201cWe are so glad you could make it. And you brought a guest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur smiled in return. \u201cThis is Kaldur\u2019ahm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is an honor to meet you sir,\u201d said the young Atantian.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to call me sir, Kaldur\u2019ahm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen please, call me Kaldur.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wally buzzed over to the new arrivals, \u201cHelloyourmajesty!You\u2019relookingasgoodasalways.Andyou!Welcome!Thename\u2019sWallyWest,akaKidFlash,thefastestkidaround!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWally!\u201d His uncle Barry scholded. \u201cSlow down there kiddo.\u201d He also had rushed forward having finished scolding Hal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Ooops\u2026 judging by their confused faces I must have spoke too fast.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOops, my bad. I go a little too fast when I get excited,\u201d Wally said sheepishly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uncle Barry greeted the King and the young man also. Arthur replied, \u201cIt is good to see you too, Flash, but I must ask, is there a problem that needs to be handled over there?\u201d He tilted his head to where Superman and Black Canary were still scolding Hal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flash rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cUm no, Diana\u2019s taking care of the worst of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh man, you\u2019ll never guess who just showed up!\u201d Wally exclaimed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho?\u201d Aquaman inquired.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The king\u2019s eyes widened slightly in surprise and looked at J'onn for conformation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>J\u2019onn nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aquaman glaced around the room. Superman and Black Canary were still lecturing Green Lantern while Green Arrow was attempting to be the \u201ccool uncle\u201d who was aiming to shoot an apple off of the head of Superboy (the younger). The kid was grinning like crazy with excitement while the older superboy stood off to the side glaring at the emerald archer. Artemis and Arsenal were chatting to each other, most likely making fun of their mentor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not seeing Batman, he asked, \u201cWhere is he then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d Wally responded. \u201cHal chose not to tell Batman about today and he showed up, but he didn\u2019t come in here so Wonder Woman figured he didn\u2019t know so we questioned Hal because you know, he was supposed to be the one in charge of telling Batman and it turns out he never told Batman because he\u2019s too scared of him, well he didn\u2019t say that was the reason, but we all know that it\u2019s true but that\u2019s why Superman and Black Canary are yelling at him and why Uncle B was. Wonder Woman did too and man she is one scary lady but then she left to go tell Batman about it being \u2018Bring your kid to work day\u2019 which isn\u2019t really even the best name since almost none of us are your guy\u2019s kids. I mean I get the sentiment but still and half of us here are too old to be considered -.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWally,\u201d Uncle B chided him again. Wally grinned sheepishly. \u201cI apologize for my nephew. He tends to ramble when he\u2019s excited. But did you get the jist of that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI believe so,\u201d Arthur replied, \u201cGreen Lantern did not do the responsibility he was given, but Batman happened to show up anyways, and Wonder Woman is currently talking with Batman about the situation?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d J\u2019onn affirmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Kaldur!\u201d Wally suddenly exclaimed, \u201cWant to meet everyone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kaldur looked to his king, who nodded in allowance. \u201cYes, it would be my honor to meet the heroes of Earth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkaaaaay, lets go,\u201d Wally felt a little awkward at Kaldur\u2019s formalness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kaldur stepped forward and Wally turned towards the others expecting to see what became of Oliver\u2019s trick but was instead greeted by a face covered with a black domino mask and the biggest smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAwk!\u201d Wally squeaked in startlement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His sudden squeal grabbed the attention of the rest of the league who quickly took defensive stances at the sudden appearance of someone they didn\u2019t know. Kon-El stood protectively in front of Jon, the three archers held their bows aimed and loaded, and Aquaman held his scepter at the neck of the man dressed in a tight fighting black combat outfit that had a bright blue bird across his chest and matching blue streaks across his knuckles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDi- I um I mean Nightwing!\u201d Wally exclaimed. Roy also shouted his name.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey KF, Arsenal, everyone else,\u201d His friend greeted them, apparently unbothered by all the sharp weapons pointed at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStand down everyone,\u201d Barry spoke in a calm voice. \u201cI know who this is.\u201d Slowly, weapons were lowered but not put away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wally was in shock, \u201cWhy are you here? HOW are you here?\u201d They were on the watchtower; no one who wasn\u2019t supposed to could get in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nightwing, being a dick, chuckled, \u201cDude, it\u2019s \u2018bring your kid to work day!\u2019 No way was I ever going to miss this!\u201d He said it like it was the most obvious thing in the world.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uncle B stepped forward and warrily spoke, \u201cNightwing, how did you get up here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Baby Bird hacked the systems. He\u2019s with the others guarding all the exits to make sure Batman doesn\u2019t esca- Oh Hey B!\u201d Nightwing suddenly shouted towards the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone turned to look to find Batman frozen midstep staring directly at the uninvited vigilante. There was a moment\u2019s pause before Batman spoke, \u201cNo,\u201d and quickly continued walking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nightwing sighed. Bringing his hand up to his ear, he spoke, \u201cBig bird to Baby bird, the target is on the move, last seen heading in your direction.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Through Nightwing\u2019s communication device came another voice, \u201cBaby bird to Big bird, target has been spotted. Initiating apprehension of target.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHold up,\u201d Superman demanded. \u201cAre you trying to kidnap Batman?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nightwing grinned, \u201cNope, just making sure he doesn\u2019t leave.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho do you think you are thinking you can keep us contained?\u201d Hal demanded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, we don\u2019t care about you, just Batman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wally didn\u2019t know where his friend was going with this, but he had seen Nightwing use that same grin before, he did not like it. He was honestly surprised no one had tried attacking his friend yet, but he guessed they trusted his uncle\u2019s vouch for him enough\u2026 or maybe they were just too confused to do anything. Wally sure knew he was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A sudden noise of a scuffle brought everyone\u2019s attention back to the entrance to the room. Batman was currently being pushed in by several masked individuals\u2026 masked individuals who were definitely too small to be fully grown adults. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Did Batman just get taken hostage by KIDS?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wally couldn\u2019t make out how many there were or what each one even looked like; they were either huddled too close to each other or blocked from view by Batman\u2019s large figure. He could tell most of them were short, short enough to be teenagers or younger. There was one dressed in yellow,\u00a0 a taller one with a bright red biker helmet, one dressed in purple, two with yellow R emblems on their chest, and one that Wally was pretty sure was an actual shadow come-to-life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After being pushed into the room, Batman looked around the room before suddenly turning back around only to find his exit still being blocked by his kidnappers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUn-hand Batman this inst-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Superman was cut off by Batman, \u201cStand down. They aren\u2019t here to attack the league.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This resulted in several inquiries from the league and their proteges.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho are these people?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat one said they hacked the systems, how is that possible?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman held up his hand, \u201cEnough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hal began, \u201cBut-\u201d he stopped talking when Batman turned his infamous batglare on him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMan, it's so nice to see that glare on someone other than us for once,\u201d the one dressed in red with a black cowl (without the bat-ears) and cape and a weird shaped yellow R spoke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, Rob?\u201d Superboy Sr. spoke up. The kid gave an awkward wave in acknowledgment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman turned around to glare at his kidnappers. The man with the biker jacket and red helmet smacked the previous speaker, \u201cYou had to jinx it, didn\u2019t you Replacement?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHood, don\u2019t hit your brother,\u201d Batman growled. Before they could respond, he continued, \u201cAnyone care to tell me why you decided to break into the watchtower?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girl clothed entirely in purple with a black mask covering her whole face cheerfully spoke, \u201cBecause it\u2019s \u2018bring your kid to work\u2019 day, so here we are!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The biker with the red helmet and guns piped up, \u201cNothing but another crowbar to the head was going to stop me from seeing this mess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>OMG are they someone\u2019s kids? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Wally looked around the room trying to figure out who. He also saw the other league members looking at one another. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Maybe it's someone who\u2019s kind of new to the league or just a part-timer?</span>\n</em>\n<span> Wally looked at Nightwing trying to recall anything he had said about a family. He knew Dick had a lot of siblings and the only time he could recall him talking about a parent was whenever he made that joke about his dad being\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh God.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Wally could finish his thought, Aquaman asked, \u201cBatman, who do these children belong to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman sighed, hesitating to answer, \u201cThey\u2019re mine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The silence on the Watchtower was deafening. There was no movement or sound.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTHEY\u2019RE WHAT?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid he just say what I think he just said?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYOU HAVE KIDS?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What did you hear him say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNO!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat those kids are his!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWHAT?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, yeah I heard that too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTHEY\u2019RE YOURS?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep!\u201d One of the children replied. Wally couldn\u2019t tell which one spoke but he could have sworn he heard Batman mumble \u201cunfortunately\u201d under his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Everyone turned once again to the entrance to the cafeteria. Diana had returned from the control room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my goddess,\u201d the young man in the red helmet stage whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTt,\u201d the smallest of the kids piped up. \u201cStop making a fool of yourself Hood. It\u2019s an embarrassment to Father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFather?\u201d Wonder Woman questioned, speaking out loud that everyone else was thinking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman cleared his throat as each of the intruders\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>his kids?</span>\n</em>\n<span>... turned their heads to Batman as if they were waiting to make sure he said the correct thing. Batman glanced at all the faces staring at him before speaking, \u201cThese are my children.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Diana\u2019s mouth dropped open for a moment before she closed it. Taking a moment to process what was just said Wonder Woman responded, \u201cI was unaware you had children, Batman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you and everyone else,\u201d Green Arrow muttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All of Batman\u2019s children began to laugh immediately.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo children, ha! He wishes!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s always complaining we\u2019re the reason he has grey hair.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI blame Goldie for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTt, uncompotent fools.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The shadow Wally had seen earlier suddenly moved. A hand reaching out appeared and flicked the nose of the child, \u201cRude.\u201d The boy slightly flinched as the shadow became still. There was some snickering from the other children.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wally could see now the figure was female, wearing all black with a cape and cowl like Batman\u2019s. Her outfit was nearly identical to Batman except her belt and bat symbol were gold and her mask had stitched fabric over her mouth. The shadow girl turned to Batman (</span>\n<em>\n<span>her father?) </span>\n</em>\n<span>and spoke again in her soft child-like voice, \u201cItroductions.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Diana cleared her throat, \u201cYes I believe introductions would be beneficial for everyone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, um, this is-\u201c Batman was suddenly cut off by Nightwing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, silly us, not introducing ourselves first,\u201d Nightwing reprimanded himself. \u201cI\u2019m Nightwing, Batman's first love child with Justice.\u201d He said it with such pride, Wally almost missed his friend\u2019s mischievous grin that meant he was joking. Not everyone else got it as a joke\u2026 judging by their confused faces.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman sighed and held his head in the palm of his hand, \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to be funny.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The kids laughed again when Nightwing pouted that he was too funny.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo you\u2019re not, dummy,\u201d the biker interceded. He wore black and grey kevlar with a leather jacket. There was a bat symbol crudely painted on his chest in the same shade of red as his helmet. With the paint dripped like blood, the bright white lenses of his mask, and the various guns and knives strapped to his personnel, the guy looked highly dangerous. \u201cI\u2019m Red Hood, Batman\u2019s second eldest.\u201d As he spoke, he removed his helmet to reveal a young face with a domino mask like Nightwing except red. There was a streak of white hair within his black hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Red Hood\u2026 that name sounds familiar</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Wally thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The shadow girl lightly smacked Red Hood. \u201cI older.\u201d She spoke with confidence despite how young she sounded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo you\u2019re not!\u201d Hood protested.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman sighed. He lifted his head from his hand to speak, \u201cThis is my daughter Black Bat. She and Hood are the same age.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis favorite.\u201d Black Bat said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t have a favorite.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes you do!\u201d All the children shouted. Batman shook his head as he placed it back down in his hand, but not before Wally could have sworn was a smile on the dark knight\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Red Robin,\u201d the next kid spoke. He wore black combat pants with a red kevlar shirt. He wore a black cape and earless cowl. His golden utility belts were criss-crossed across his chest forming a V; a golden R, shaped to look like a bird, was at the center. \u201cI\u2019m Batman\u2019s fourth child.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Spoiler!\u201d The girl in purple exclaimed cheerfully. Her kevlar outfit and cape were entirely a dark purple. She wore a black mask with white lenses that covered her face entirely. Long strands of blonde hair fell through from underneath her purple hood. \u201cI am NOT one of Batman\u2019s kids.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen why do you always sleep at my house, eat all my food, and spend my money?\u201d Batman muttered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause I am a poor college student and you\u2019re too much of a pushover to say no,\u201d Spoiler responded as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, which it wasn\u2019t</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman only grunted in response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I um, I guess I\u2019m up next.\u201d The teenager wore a black and bright yellow kevlar suit, making him stand out against his siblings who all wore mostly dark colored attire. That and what little of his skin was showing looked african american. \u201cMy codename is Signal, and I\u2019m actually not one of his kids either.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTechnically you are,\u201d Red Robin said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d questioned Black Canary.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman spoke up again, \u201c I\u2019m fostering him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Batman is a foster parent?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, time out!\u201d cried Green Lantern. \u201cDoes no one else have a problem with this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other members of the league just stood there and looked confused by Hal\u2019s outburst.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that mean, Hal?\u201d Black Canary accused him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpooky having Kids! What else would you think I mean?\u201d Hal exclaimed. \u201cAm I the only one not bothered by that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Batman said, sounding offended.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow dare you speak about my father that way!\u201d the smallest of the kids cried in outrage. The kid pulled out his sword, which was almost as long as he was. His siblings made no movement to stop the kid as he pointed it at Green Lantern. In fact, they looked rather angry too, their glares were as deadly as Batman\u2019s was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, stand down.\u201d Batman ordered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Father he-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The child lowered his weapon, though he did not look happy about it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about them Hal,\u201d Wally found himself saying. \u201cI\u2019ve known Nightwing for several years now, heck he\u2019s my best friend. I trust him with my life. While I didn\u2019t know him being Batman\u2019s kid-\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDude I told you multiple times that Batman was my dad!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you were joking!\u201d Wally protested. \u201cAnyways, despite not knowing who his family was, he\u2019s never spoke of anything but love for them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve also met Nightwing,\u201d Uncle Barry added, \u201cI had actually been thinking about introducing to the League for a while now. I even mentioned it to Diana earlier today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Nightwing grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hood snorted, \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Diana interrupted them, \u201cThat is true. Hal, I understand your concern. I must admit I too was weary at first, but that was before they introduced themselves. My sisters Donna, Artemis, and Cassie have met Nightwing, Red Hood, and Red Robin. They speak of them as close friends and worthy companions in battle. I did not know of their connections to Batman or even each other, no do I believe my sisters do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arsenal spoke of knowing Red Hood, and Kon-El spoke of knowing Red Robin. With each person that spoke of knowing of the Bats, everyone became more relaxed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone calmed back down, the smallest of Batman\u2019s children introduced himself, \u201cI am Robin, son of Batman, and the youngest of my siblings.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is nice to meet all of you and a pleasure to be able to put faces to the names I have heard so much about,\u201d Diana smiled. \u201cAs I am sure you already know I am Diana of Themyscira.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you Wonder Woman,\u201d Nightwing responded. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet </span>\n<em>\n<span>all</span>\n</em>\n<span> of you. Batman\u2019s told us a lot about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman talks about us?\u201d Superman asked, pleasantly surprised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course!\u201d Nightwing responded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat and we\u2019ve read all the mission reports,\u201d Red Robin added.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought only League members had access to the mission reports?\u201d King Arthur questioned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it's </span>\n<em>\n<span>supposed to </span>\n</em>\n<span>be.\u201d Batman grumbled while glaring at his smiling children.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said something about hacking the system, is that how?\u201d Black Canary asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There were some worried glances passed between the League members. Batman quickly reassured them, \u201cOur system is still secure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen how come a bunch of kids were able to get in?\u201d Exclaimed Green Arrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not kids!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause there isn\u2019t a system in the universe they can\u2019t get into,\u201d Batman stated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This caused the kids to smile at their father. It made some of the League members smile to hear Batman brag about his kids.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Green Arrow looked like he was about to say something more, but he was interrupted by the arrival of Donna and Cassie. Both look surprised by the amount of people there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid I accidently go on another multi-dimensional trip again,\u201d Donna asked at the same time Cassie asked, \u201cRob, what are you doing here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The introductions of everyone happened all over again. Diana had guessed right that her sisters were unaware of their friends' relations to Batman and to each other. After they were reintroduced, the other League members introduced themselves and their proteges. Most of them knew of each other already, but no one knew of the individual Aquaman had brought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is Kaldur\u2019ahm,\u201d the Atlantean king spoke. \u201cI have struggled with balancing the responsibilities of being both King and a member of the Justice league. I have discussed this with some of you already about the importance of having an Atlantean representative on the surface. With much thought I have decided to step down from being a member of the Justice League. I have been training Kaldur here to take my place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shocked faces ripped through the crowd. Flash wined, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving us?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Arthur chuckled. \u201cDo not worry friend; it will still be some time from now before I leave.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>More members of the League spoke up about their support for the king\u2019s decision, some asking if it was also because of his unborn child. Arthur had admitted that it did affect his decision. Everyone greeted Kaldur, welcoming him, and said they were looking forward to getting to know him better.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo now that introductions are done, does this mean we can go on with the party now?\u201d The younger Superboy asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Superman laughed, \u201cYes, Jon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone conversed with each other. Everyone wanted to talk with Batman\u2019s kids and with the Atlanteans. Robin had an intriguing conversation with Diana about ancient greek culture and warfare, Spoiler had a blast talking with Black Canary about defensive maneuvers, Hal was seen laughing at whatever Red Hood told him, Black Bat was seen having a silent conversation with J\u2019onn, Red Robin discussed politics with Aquaman, and Nightwing and Signal conversed with Superman and Flash. Later when Robin and Superboy were seen talking to each other, Spoiler had exclaimed, \u201cAww, look how cute they look together!\u201d Robin had not been happy with being called cute.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day was full of laughs and mischief, of course caused by the bats. By the end of the gathering, Wally and his Uncle had both had their plates of food stolen a combined total of fourteen times, all of the arrows from Arsenal and Green Arrow\u2019s quivers had been switched with each other, Superman and Superboy Jr. had their capes switched around, leaving Superman with a tiny cape and Jon drowning in his father\u2019s larger cape, and Hal had his ring stolen four times. Everyone was enjoying themselves even when they were the unsuspecting victims of the pranks. Watching the kids pull pranks on Batman made up for it. Batman had his belt stolen twice and his glove once. Wally had no idea how they managed to get Batman\u2019s glove without him noticing, but they did. It was also hilarious to see the young vigilantes physically drag or push their father around with them and force him to be part of their conversations.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Superman spoke, \u201cThis was really fun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Wonder Woman agreed, \u201cWe should have more gathering together. Maybe even invite the rest of everyone\u2019s families.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re asking for, do you?\u201d Batman said, sounding tired.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do we not know?\u201d Superman asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was a moment of silence as they looked at one another, grinning. Signal spoke up, \u201cThere\u2019s more of us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat!\u201d</span>\n</p>"
