  "summary": "<p>Wei Wuxian gets caught sneaking into Cloud Recesses. </p>\n<p>But since he can't tell the truth - that he's just here to deliver his teacher's most recent love letter to her soulmate who's stuck in a cave - he tells a lie instead. He says that he's a Jiang disciple that had arrived late and so had snuck in through the gates. He hadn't expected the lie to work, sure that it would unravel as soon as they found a Jiang to verify it, but instead Jiang Yanli backs up his story, and even adds to it. </p>\n<p>Which is how he ends up masquerading as the first disciple of Lotus Pier while trying to figure out how to get out of Cloud Recesses without anyone discovering that he's the disciple of Baoshan Sanren.</p>",

  "text": "<p>At first, Wei Wuxian thinks that his mother has come back for him.</p>\n<p>The first thing he sees is white robes embroidered with silver, just like Mama always wore, and he thinks that she\u2019s found him, that after months being on his own in the streets, of fighting dogs for watermelon rinds, his mother has come to take him home.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, A-Ying,\u201d says a voice that\u2019s almost but not quite familiar to him. The woman bends down and she\u2019s very beautiful, her young face at odds with her pure white hair. \u201cI only just heard about your parents. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says automatically, even though he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening or who she is. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles and holds out her hands. \u201cI knew your mother. She was very dear to me. Won\u2019t you come with me, A-Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at her for a long moment, then at her outstretched hands, and says, \u201cOkay,\u201d before placing his hands in hers. He immediately wants to snatch them back, because they\u2019re too dirty to touch her, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice that. Instead she grips his fingers and lifts him up, pulling him into her arms and smearing dirt across her perfectly white robes.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen knows that Master Baoshan only leaves the mountain for one reason, so he\u2019s not surprised when she comes back with a little kid in her arms.</p>\n<p>He is surprised when he learns that little kid is Shijie\u2019s son.</p>\n<p>It had been Shijie who\u2019d found him when he was just seven years old, who\u2019d carried him on her back up the mountain, breaking the vow she\u2019d taken when she\u2019d walked down it so that she could place him in front of Master Baoshan. He\u2019d thought that maybe he\u2019d see her again, one day, if he ever decided to leave the mountain himself.</p>\n<p>Except she\u2019d died, too young, barely ten years after she\u2019d left the mountain and four years after she\u2019d saved Xiao Xingchen. Shijie had seemed so strong for those brief few days he\u2019d known her. He\u2019d dreamed of being as strong as her one day, and now she\u2019s gone, and it doesn\u2019t seem real, doesn\u2019t seem fair.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s a little boy who can\u2019t have been born much longer after Shijie found him and he looks around with bright, soft eyes that remind him a lot of the woman he barely knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cXingchen,\u201d Master Baoshan says. \u201cThis is your brother. You are as responsible for training and caring for him as I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Master Baoshan,\u201d he says, reaching out to rub some of the dirt from his face, although that doesn\u2019t do much for the dirt covering him everywhere else. \u201cHello, Ying-di.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says, then after a moment he tacks on, \u201cXingchen-ge,\u201d and grins at him, all dimples and missing teeth, and Xiao Xingchen loves him, then, as if he really were his flesh and blood brother.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Xingchen-ge has a lot of really strong opinions about leaving the mountain that he talks about at length whenever the subject comes up. He talks about how immortals have removed themselves from society for the good of all and how immortals\u2019 disciples have a duty to maintain this separation, to live in either one world or the other, about how one day their disciples all have to choose whether they\u2019ll live and die on this mountain or go and live and die in the land of mortals. This is all really awkward for Wei Wuxian, since he\u2019s been following the path down the mountain into town since he was eight.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I not be going down?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks Aunt Baoshan after yet another impassioned lecture that he ends up just nodding his way through.</p>\n<p>Aunt Baoshan laughs and drops several coins into his palm. \u201cGet one of those little cakes for me too and bring back enough chili oil to at least last us the month. Don\u2019t worry about Xingchen. He\u2019ll learn that things aren\u2019t so black and white in his own time. And to question where all our chili oil comes from when don\u2019t grow nearly that amount of chilies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould I bring a cake back for Gege too?\u201d he asks, looking at the coins his palms. It\u2019s too much, but no matter how many times he tells her that, she never gives him any less. They don\u2019t even need to eat, really. One of the first things Aunt Baoshan taught him how to do was survive off inedia so he\u2019d never be hungry again, but even though Aunt Baoshan doesn\u2019t usually eat, she keeps saying that he and Xingchen-ge are growing boys that need proper meals and it\u2019s pointless to try and nurture and deplete their golden cores at the same time.</p>\n<p>Working in the gardens is his favorite thing. Sometimes he thinks he could spend his whole life coaxing life from the earth and never get tired of it.</p>\n<p>They eat meat often enough, especially once he gets really good at using the bow, but meat as spicy as he likes it is something he usually has to go into town to find.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not a good enough cook to try and take credit for that one,\u201d she says, absently taking his hair out it\u2019s ponytail to retie it. \u201cNow hurry along. Make sure you\u2019re back on the path before sunset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Aunt Baoshan,\u201d he says, dutifully trading his white robes out for black like he does every time he walks down the mountain.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing for him to leave the safety of Aunt Baoshan\u2019s mountain, after all, and quite another for someone to recognize him as her disciple.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren doesn\u2019t feel old most days.</p>\n<p>She sometimes feels tired, but not old, thanks to the disciples running through her mountain and causing problems. Most of her children live and die on this mountain, and that won\u2019t ever stop hurting, but she loves them, she gives them long, good lives that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to have had she left them where she found them.</p>\n<p>Cangse had been the first one that she thought she might be able to keep, the first one that had the potential to cultivate to immortality alongside her. Then she\u2019d left, which had been fine. She was allowed to have a life bigger than this mountain, and she\u2019d come back twice, to tell her that she\u2019d found a man to love and to bring her Xingchen, and Baoshan Sanren hadn\u2019t minded. Cangse was probably going to live for a long time, was going to visit her for a long time, so if she lingered in her new freedom and didn\u2019t visit home enough, Baoshan Sanren wouldn\u2019t hold it against her.</p>\n<p>But then she\u2019d died.</p>\n<p>Her brightest pupil dead and gone and Baoshan Sanren hadn\u2019t even heard of it in time to stop her and her husband\u2019s bones from being scavenged by animals.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d felt old, then.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d felt her heart hardening, had felt the urge to slip into the harsh and uncompromising person she\u2019d once been.</p>\n<p>When she was a girl, in the true flush of youth rather than the facsimile of it she now wears, she had two friends who were too soft for their own good.</p>\n<p>Wen Mao was bright eyed and gentle and spoke of building a clan that relied on the ties of family to defeat evil. Lan An had always been obnoxious, but he considered kindness to be a pillar of his character, and Baoshan Sanren had never been able shake him from his stuffy, reserved manor no matter how many times she threatened to shave off his beard.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d stopped aging long before both of them, and she teased them about that too, how it took them until they were nearly forty to freeze their faces in time while her skin was still unlined and her hair still black.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d gotten the last laugh on that one, at least. Her hair had turned white in the battle against Xue Chonghai, from the effort of containing the power of the Yin Iron long enough to kill the man who\u2019d created it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d had a lot of principles as a girl, a clear way of looking at the world that they\u2019d shared. Good was good and evil was evil and evil was meant to be eliminated.</p>\n<p>Then, when her dear friends had finally succumbed to age, either unwilling or unable to cultivate to immortality no matter how much she begged, she grew even colder. The world was changing and she wasn\u2019t and she didn\u2019t want to. All her power and skill and the long years looming ahead of her, and what was she supposed to do with it? She had no interest in starting a clan based on blood ties like her friends, had no interest in founding her own clan at all, really. It seemed like an awful lot of work, from where she\u2019d been.</p>\n<p>She spent a lot of time with the Wen, looking after Wen Mao\u2019s descendants since he couldn\u2019t, but she couldn\u2019t stand the Lan, mostly. Lan An had been fun when they were kids, at least, but his children seemed determined to be as boring as possible, taking his list of rules as commandments rather than guidelines.</p>\n<p>Then she\u2019d dragged herself to pay a visit, roughly a century overdue, and met Lan Yi.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi was the first disciple, daughter to the clan head, and burned brighter than anyone else Baoshan Sanren had ever met. She was brilliant and argumentative, fascinating and beautiful, and she didn\u2019t leave the Lan for a long time after that, no matter how annoying their rule against drinking was.</p>\n<p>The first time Lan Yi had broken that rule with her, taking a defiant sip of Emperor\u2019s Smile that made her cheeks flush, Baoshan Sanren had felt as if she were flying, that the point of her long life was to see Lan Yi with flashing eyes and a smiling mouth.</p>\n<p>Then Lan Yi had kissed her with that smiling mouth, and her golden core had felt like a living flame beneath her skin. Lan Yi had cultivated to immortality nearly ten years into being the Lan sect leader. Baoshan Sanren had been so pathetically grateful that she wouldn\u2019t be alone, that the woman she loved wouldn\u2019t age and die as her friends had.</p>\n<p>But Baoshan Sanren had learned that death wasn\u2019t the only way someone she loved could be taken from her.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi had believed she could master resentful energy, had thought that Yin Iron held the secrets she was looking for, and her arrogance that Baoshan Sanren so loved meant she wouldn\u2019t listen no matter how wrong and dangerous her actions were.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren had once been someone who believed in destroying evil, and what Lan Yi was doing was evil, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to destroy the woman she loved.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi realized the truth, in the end, but it was too late.</p>\n<p>The only way she could protect the Yin Iron was to fade away in a cave. Baoshan Sanren wanted to stay with her, to protect the Yin Iron with her, but Lan Yi refused, even warding her cave against her.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi hadn\u2019t wanted Baoshan Sanren to give her life up to be with her, as if a life without her was even worth having to begin with.</p>\n<p>But she couldn\u2019t force it, so she hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d left her love to her cave and retreated to her mountain, having had enough of meddling in the affairs in a world she\u2019d outlived, and that, it seems, was that. The end to their story.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren had resigned herself to losing everyone she loved, up until Cangse, up until she found and raised a child who might be able to gain immortality.</p>\n<p>Then Cangse had died and it had felt like another punchline in a series of cruel jokes. What does her kindness and love get her in the end? Nothing but dead children and a cave she can\u2019t enter.</p>\n<p>But she still has Xingchen, and Cangse had a child before she died, and maybe she can\u2019t save Cangse, but she can save her child.</p>\n<p>She finds Wuxian, a small, helpless thing, and she loves him, just like she loves all the small helpless children that find her way to her.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s kind and caring and brilliant, a type of searing brilliance that she hasn\u2019t seen since his mother, since Lan Yi.</p>\n<p>She thinks that Wuxian could cultivate to immortality, if he wanted to, if he tries hard enough and doesn\u2019t die young. She wants to keep him selfishly at her side no matter what, to make sure she doesn\u2019t lose him like she lost his mother, but she knows that that\u2019s not fair, so she leans the other direction. She gives him more freedom than she\u2019d given her other children, because he has to choose it, because he\u2019s strong enough that she can\u2019t justify giving him any less, and she hopes it balances out the way she works him twice as hard as she had her other children. She teaches him everything she can, all the forms from every clan instead of just her own style. The sooner he sees what connects them all, hopefully the sooner he\u2019ll realize what those connection mean for him, what the secret to cultivating to immortality really is. She wishes she could just tell him, but it\u2019s not something that can be taught, only learned.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s old, even if she doesn\u2019t look it, and she should know better than to hope for more than she has, but she can\u2019t help herself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian is eleven years old, Xingchen-ge walks down the mountain for the first time, but he doesn\u2019t plan to ever walk back up it again. Wei Wuxian clings to him, not begging him to stay because he knows that this is something that Xingchen-ge feels he has to do, that the way he can repay the universe for leading him to Aunt Baoshan is to descend the mountain and use her teachings to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks that\u2019s crap. The universe didn\u2019t bring Xingchen-ge to the mountain, his mother did, and now he\u2019s leaving him and it\u2019s not <em>fair</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s too old for it now, but Aunt Baoshan lets him cling to her and hide his face in his shoulder as she rubs a soothing hand down his back. \u201cYou said he\u2019d grow out of it,\u201d he sniffles, \u201cyou said he\u2019d realize the world isn\u2019t so simple, but now he\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can he learn about a world he\u2019s never experienced?\u201d she asks calmly. \u201cPeople have to walk their own paths and develop their own worldviews, Wuxian. You can\u2019t do it for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll miss him,\u201d he mumbles, wiping his tears on her robe.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to let people make their own choices,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if that means they don\u2019t choose you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That sounds like crap too, actually, but something in her tone of voice stops him from pushing it.</p>\n<p>Months later, when he\u2019s exploring the mountain on his own, he goes off the path like he\u2019s very much not supposed to do, and he find something interesting.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an old stone building, moss growing up the side. The door opens easily, as if it\u2019s still used, which doesn\u2019t make any sense at all, but what\u2019s inside makes even less sense than that. It\u2019s got nothing in it but a writing desk and several candles. Then he notices the walls.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re covered floor to ceiling with boxes. He reaches for the nearest one and opens it up, grabbing a piece of paper at random.</p>\n<p><em>Dearest A-Yi</em>, it reads, <em>Xingchen mastered a new form yesterday and was so happy I wanted to embrace him, but he\u2019s much too old for that now, so instead I just held his shoulders and said I was proud of him. I always think of you with your nephews when I do this, of how desperate they were to impress you\u2026</em></p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shouldn\u2019t read a letter not meant for him, but he\u2019s not great at stopping himself from doing things, and it\u2019s right there. He reads for hours, carefully searching for the oldest boxes without sending anything crashing to the ground. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to figure it out.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take long for him to make a decision.</p>\n<p>He sneaks away to read the letters for the next few weeks, just until he\u2019s sure he has the information he needs, just to make sure he can do what he needs to do.</p>\n<p>He puts on a black robe like he always does when he descends the mountain, tries to smile and not feel too guilty when he accepts the handful of coins Aunt Baoshan presses into his hands, and walks down the mountain like he has so many times before.</p>\n<p>Except this time he doesn\u2019t just go to the nearest town, or even the nearest city. He has to go further than that.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to Gusu. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Yi has lived in the cave under cold springs with not a single descendent or disciple finding her for the hundreds of years she\u2019d been here, which means she\u2019s very unprepared for a young boy to come tumbling down into her cave, soaked and shivering, not even wearing the robes of her sect.</p>\n<p>She thinks it may be a trap, is almost willing to let her guqin kill him, when he staggers from the hit and gasps out, \u201cI\u2019m the disciple of Baoshan Sanren! Lan Yi, please!\u201d</p>\n<p>She slams her hand down on the strings, ignoring the pain as the energy kicks back through her body. \u201cIs she hurt? Is something wrong?\u201d She can\u2019t think of any other reason Baoshan would send someone here after all these years. She made a vow to protect the Yin Iron, has tied that protection to her presence in this cave, but if Baoshan needs her \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cShe misses you,\u201d the boy says, stumbling forward until he can kneel in front of her. She flinches. He takes a pouch out of his robes and holds it out to her. \u201cI took the oldest and newest I could find.\u201d</p>\n<p>It could be a trick, still, but it\u2019s Baoshan. She has to risk it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not going to sacrifice any of her rabbits and she can\u2019t exactly make a new one right now, so she reaches up and pulls off her forehead ribbon, lightly looping it around his neck to stop her guqin from attacking him and ignoring her discomfort at seeing her ribbon against his skin.</p>\n<p>If he really is Baoshan\u2019s disciple, then he\u2019s as close to a child as she\u2019ll ever have, after all.</p>\n<p>The pouch has two letters in it, both from Baoshan.</p>\n<p>One is dated from just a few days ago.</p>\n<p>The other is dated only a couple months after Lan Yi blocked her from the cave for the last time.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe has a whole building of them,\u201d the boy says. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s about every week, sometimes more. I know what you\u2019re doing is important, but she misses you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Yi doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s crying until her tears smear the ink of the letters and she hurries to wipe them away before they can do any more damage. \u201cI can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, sounding much older than he looks just then. \u201cPeople have to make their own choices and walk their own paths. But you can write her letters, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get through the wards,\u201d she says regretfully. The only reason he was able to get through them was because he must have figured out the precise place to step and the exact amount of spiritual pressure to exert from Baoshan.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can\u2019t get through the wards on our mountain either,\u201d he says, and Lan Yi almost laughs at hearing that Baoshan has claimed a whole mountain for herself. \u201cBut I can. I can come to your cave and Aunt Baoshan\u2019s mountain and even if you can\u2019t see each other, even if you have your duty and she has her vow to not get involved in things anymore, you can have <em>something</em>. Isn\u2019t that better than nothing?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lan Yi had sent Baoshan away, she hadn\u2019t wanted her to waste her immortal life in a dark, damp cave, had wanted her to forget her and live a full life and find someone smarter to love, someone who didn\u2019t think they could bend the impossible to their will. But instead Baoshan has a building full of hundreds of years of letters that she knew Lan Yi would never be able read.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t regret it, because Baoshan has gone and gotten a disciple brave and reckless enough to do the impossible, to sneak into Cloud Recesses and find her.</p>\n<p>Which, actually. \u201cHow did you get past the gates?\u201d</p>\n<p>He winces and pulls a piece of white jade from his sleeve. \u201cShe still has the jade token you gave her.\u201d He pauses, then adds judgmentally, \u201cYour decedents really need to update their wards.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hasn\u2019t laughed in so long, but she\u2019s laughing now, big and loud enough for her stomach to ache, enough that she has to reach out and grab his shoulder to steady herself. Then she does something she never thought she\u2019d do.</p>\n<p>She writes Baoshan a letter.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">`~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has barely stepped onto the path leading up the mountain when Aunt Baoshan lands in front of him, jumping off her sword with her white hair flying as she runs for him. He takes a hasty step back, but Aunt Baoshan grabs his shoulders and shakes him, her eyes wide. \u201cWhere have you been? What happened? What were you thinking? Anything could have happened to you! Just because you miss Xingchen doesn\u2019t mean you can just go running off on your own-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Gege,\u201d he says, interrupting her before she really gets going because otherwise he won\u2019t be able to get a word in for the next hour. He takes out the letter and Aunt Baoshan pales, reaching out with trembling fingers for the forehead ribbon wrapped around the scroll. He pushes it into her hands and says, \u201cYou can\u2019t give up on the people you love, Aunt Baoshan.\u201d</p>\n<p>She cradles the ribbon wrapped scroll in her hands and says, \u201cYou idiotic boy. You\u2019re in so much trouble,\u201d before pulling him in to a too tight hug that crushes the breath from his lungs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Aunt Baoshan,\u201d he wheezes, hugging her back. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the beginning.</p>\n<p>Every other month, Wei Wuxian travels the two days it takes to get to Gusu, delivers Aunt Baoshan\u2019s letter and spends the day with Lan Yi, then makes the trip straight back to the mountain with her reply in hand.</p>\n<p>As he gets older, he starts making detours, starts taking a lot longer to get to and from Gusu. He explores new places, meets new people, and a couple times he has to hastily move on because he hears that Xingchen-ge is nearby.</p>\n<p>He wants to see him only slightly less than he doesn\u2019t want to be yelled at by him. One day he\u2019ll come back up the mountain and then maybe then he won\u2019t be so mad when he finds out that Wei Wuxian has been going up and down the mountain since he was a kid. He\u2019ll definitely be <em>really</em> mad if he bumps into him in a random town in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p>It all goes perfectly up until four years into it when he\u2019s sneaking into Cloud Recesses, like he always does, with two jars of Emperor\u2019s Smile \u2013 one for him and the other for Aunt Yi \u2013 and someone <em>catches him</em>!</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian would be angrier about this, except they fight to a standstill, him and this beautiful boy exchanging blows beneath the moonlight. \u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201d the beautiful, infuriating boy asks, sword to his throat, and Wei Wuxian should be busy mourning his two bottle of broken wine, but this is a lot more interesting than that.</p>\n<p>There a couple moves he could use to get himself out of this situation, but if he proves himself to be a threat, they may actually tighten security. Which he supports in principle, because their security is kind of terrible, but in practice that will get in the way of delivering love letters to his master\u2019s soulmate, and he\u2019s invested too much into this rekindled romance to see it all go down in flames just because some uptight disciple found him jumping across the roofs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Wei Wuxian,\u201d he answers, mind racing. The foreign disciples should be visiting. Aunt Yi had mentioned it on his last visit. \u201cI\u2019m a guest disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich clan?\u201d he snaps, looking his black robes up and down derisively.</p>\n<p>Oh, shit. Uh. \u201cThe Jiang,\u201d he answers and then has to resist the urge to wince. His father was in the Jiang, but that won\u2019t do him a lot of good with a bunch of disciples that are his age. Regardless, it\u2019s his best chance. If any clan would be willing to help get him out of this situation just for laughs, it would be the Jiang, although lying to help out a possibly dangerous stranger isn\u2019t really something a sane person would do.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, he might be able to use their confusion to escape. If he can just get to the cold pond, he\u2019ll be able to hide out from them in Aunt Yi\u2019s cave. Maybe. Unless they manage to catch up to him there, and then he can\u2019t, because then he\u2019ll be leading them right to her, and her piece of the Yin Iron, and he can\u2019t do that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible he\u2019s a little bit screwed here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli has been in Cloud Recesses less than a day when she\u2019s summoned to Lan Qiren\u2019s quarters on her way to dinner. Jiang Yanli smiles at her sect sisters, grateful for the first time that her brother is on the other side of the grounds, and clasps her hands together inside her sleeves so no one can them shaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She enters, bows, and Lan Qiren says, \u201cThis boy claims he\u2019s part of your clan. Wangji found him breaking in and he had\u00a0<em>alcohol\u00a0</em>on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>She blinks slowly, glad her face is turned towards the ground, then looks up. There\u2019s not only Lan Qiren, but Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Between them is a boy who can\u2019t be much older than A-Cheng, wearing scruffy dark clothes and his hair in a disgrace of a ponytail. He looks at her, wide eyed and pleading, and she doesn\u2019t know him but she feels her heart soften. He\u2019s too skinny. She wishes she had something to feed him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Jiang?\u201d Lan Xichen prompts her.</p>\n<p>She bows again and is speaking before she can think better of it. \u201cI apologize for his disruption. Please forgive him, he is unaware of the rules of Cloud Recesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he is part of your clan?\u201d Lan Qiren demands incredulously. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he arrive with the rest of you then?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good question. She should answer it. It better be a good answer. \u201cHe\u2019s our new first disciple and there were several things he needed to arrange back home before leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t currently have a first disciple. Mother wants A-Cheng to be given the position, but both Father and A-Cheng know he\u2019s not ready for that yet, so instead they haven\u2019t appointed one at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear about this,\u201d Lan Qiren says, glaring.</p>\n<p>The boy steps forward, winking at her before all the Lans turn to face him. \u201cMy apologies, please let me introduce myself properly. I used to be a rogue cultivator, so I doubt you\u2019ve heard of me, but I\u2019m Wei Wuxian, the first disciple of Lotus Pier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Lan Qiren repeats, pale and wide eyed. \u201cNot \u2013 not Cangse Sanren\u2019s son?\u201d</p>\n<p>No way. No\u00a0<em>way</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he blinks. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me. Did you know my mom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dead,\u201d Lan Qiren says, staring at him like he really is looking at a ghost.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian glances at her, like he\u2019s looking for help or maybe just for someone else to be in on the joke. \u201cWell. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some more awkward silence, and Jiang Yanli wants them out of there. The longer this goes on, the more likely it is they\u2019re going to get caught. \u201cIf we may go to dinner, Master Lan? I\u2019m sure A-Xian has had a long journey.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hopes he doesn\u2019t mind the familiarity when they\u2019ve just met, but it makes the whole story a little bit more believable, she thinks.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t seem to mind, instead lighting up and saying, \u201cYes, dinner sounds great. Shijie needs to keep her strength up, Master Lan, if you\u2019ll please excuse us. I really am very sorry about breaking the rules.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sound very sorry, but Lan Qiren still seems to be in too much shock to call him out on it. Instead they\u2019re dismissed, no punishment doled out even as Lan Wangji scowls and Lan Xichen only looks slightly less surprised than his uncle.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waits until they\u2019re in the hallway to turn and grin at her. \u201cYou are literally the coolest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>She flushes, tucking some of his hair that has gotten loose form its tie behind his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t get caught sneaking out this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSneaking out?\u201d he repeats, then shakes his head. \u201cNo way, they\u2019ll totally figure it all out and then you\u2019ll get in so much trouble. I\u2019ll stay. Maybe I can get them to kick me out or something instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pauses, because she likes him already, obviously, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have lied for him, but. \u201cI told them you were our first disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>When nothing else is forthcoming, she asks, \u201cCan you \u2026 pass as a first disciple?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019d helped him without considering the consequences, and if he disappears and the truth comes out she definitely will get in trouble for helping out a random rogue cultivator, but \u2013 she\u2019s heard the rumors, has vague memories of the fights her parents used to have. Cangse Sanren\u2019s husband used to belong to their clan, so Wei Wuxian is one of them, almost, and it\u2019s good that she helped him. That won\u2019t work on her mother, but her father will probably let it slide.</p>\n<p>He looks at her and laughs, holding out his wrist to her. She hesitates, but he is offering, so she presses her fingers against his pulse and then he has to wrap an arm around her waist to keep her from staggering. His golden core thrums under his skin like a tidal wave, the bright, powerful rush of energy feeling like an endless well, like the deepest of their lakes back home. \u201cI might need a refresher on some of the Jiang forms, but I wouldn\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRefresher,\u201d she repeats, looking at this boy that is supposed to be dead, who is the son of the famed Cangse Sanren and has a golden core stronger than any she\u2019s ever felt and who absolutely no one has heard of before now. \u201cYou know them already?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know all the major clans\u2019 forms,\u201d he says carelessly and offers her his arm as they walk towards the dining hall.</p>\n<p>She takes it, head spinning with an impossible thought. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. She thinks she\u2019s right anyway.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have the silver and white robes, and his sword has a basic wooden sheath, but nothing else can explain the strength of the core she felt beneath her fingers. No one could be that strong without anyone noticing, not even as a rogue cultivator.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is a disciple of Baoshan Sanren, just like the famous Xiao Xingchen, just like his mother.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t have time to overthink it, because then they\u2019re entering the dining hall, the meal just about to start. They walk over to where all the other Jiang disciples are clustered and all their eyes are on them, outrage hovering around the edges of A-Cheng\u2019s mouth when he sees her hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur first disciple got in a bit of trouble,\u201d she says, smiling, aware of all the eyes and ears on them that don\u2019t belong to her clan. \u201cA-Xian, you should really apologize to all your sect brothers and sisters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian goes into an elaborate bow. \u201cThis Wei Wuxian begs forgiveness and promises to do a better job of upholding the honor of the Jiang Clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence where everyone looks at her, then to him, and she\u00a0<em>loves her clan</em>\u00a0because as one big smiles come over their faces and they groan, acting like this is another one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s antics, like he\u2019s familiar and one of them and this is just to be expected, really, as if they\u2019re not all seeing him for the first time. She sits down next to A-Cheng, dragging Wei Wuxian with her.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-jie,\u201d he hisses, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, my dear sweet brother,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sitting on the opposite side of A-Cheng and draping his arm around his shoulders. A-Cheng scowls but doesn\u2019t push him away or start screaming, so clearly she\u2019s not the only one who likes him. \u201cWe\u2019ll fill you in later, yeah? It\u2019s been a really interesting night.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Cheng ignores him to look at her, raising an eyebrow. \u201cReally, A-jie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe nice to A-Xian,\u201d she says. \u201cOur brother has had a long night.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks between them, waits for someone to explain and then clearly gives up, slouching into his seat. \u201cFine, okay, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>The gong rings and there\u2019s no more talking now, as the food is brought out, and she serves both A-Cheng and A-Xian and they both turn to stop her, meet each other\u2019s gazes, and grin, united in maneuvering her back into her seat and putting food onto her plate.</p>\n<p>She allows it, because she\u2019s had a long night too, but they better not get used to getting away with this.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng thinks his sister has lost her mind. Everyone else does too, but they\u2019re having a lot of fun with it, probably because they\u2019re not the ones Mother is going to yell at. A-jie outranks them, so if she tells them to lie about the identity of their first disciple and pretend that this random cultivator is one of them, they\u2019re going to do it.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help at all that Wei Wuxian is fitting in like he really is one of them, laughing and joking. He\u2019s even really acting like a first disciple, observing the spars that break out after dinner and correcting the footwork of forms he isn\u2019t even supposed to know.</p>\n<p>He gets put in the same room as Jiang Cheng, which at least means he\u2019s there when A-jie comes to see them right before curfew so he can yell at them both at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he tells A-jie. \u201cWhy do you care about him? You don\u2019t even know him!\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles and says, \u201cA-Cheng, be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, A-Cheng, be nice to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, which is so rude that he reaches for his sword, except Wei Wuxian just laughs at his outrage. But not meanly, not like he\u2019s making fun of him or mocking him. He leans over to knock their shoulders together, his smile still wide and friendly and not even a little cruel, and he feels most of his irritation draining away despite himself.</p>\n<p>Most people either get mad or scared at his temper, but Wei Wuxian does neither, doesn\u2019t even call him out on it, just acts like they\u2019re friends and smiles as if it doesn\u2019t even matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian is doing this to help me,\u201d she says. \u201cIf he just disappears, then I\u2019ll get in trouble. He\u2019s helping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods seriously. Jiang Cheng resists the urge to throw a pillow at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you even helped him in the first place,\u201d he grumbles.</p>\n<p>A-jie softens and smiles at Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt just seemed the right thing to do. We\u2019ll figure it out. You\u2019ll help us, won\u2019t you A-Cheng?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian and A-jie look at him with identical pleading expressions, both of them very earnest and even more ridiculous because of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, alright, whatever,\u201d he says. A-jie pats his hands and Wei Wuxian throws his arms around him, which isn\u2019t the worst thing ever, he guesses.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>This whole paper-thin ruse is the dumbest thing he\u2019s done in, well, ever probably. But it\u2019s also the most fun he\u2019s ever had, so Wei Wuxian can\u2019t bring himself to regret it too much.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, he shouldn\u2019t have used his own name, but he really hadn\u2019t expected anyone to recognize it. It\u2019s just his luck that he\u2019d run into one of the few people that had not only known his mother personally, but had also known she had a husband and son. Wei isn\u2019t usually a name that got recognized. He\u2019s been using it on the road for years and no one has ever figured out that he was the son of Cangse Sanren.</p>\n<p>He should probably tell Aunt Baoshan about all of this, except that there\u2019s one problem with that.</p>\n<p>Messages can\u2019t make their way through the wards on the mountain, and he can\u2019t exactly disappear for four days to go home and back without anyone in Cloud Recesses noticing, but he could get a message to Aunt Baoshan through Xingchen-ge. That would, however, mean coming clean about the fact he\u2019s been sneaking off the mountain for years and asking his sect brother to break his self imposed exile. After losing his hearing from how much Xingchen-ge would yell at him, Aunt Baoshan would kick his ass for telling him the truth just to send a message.</p>\n<p>If Aunt Baoshan gets that curious about what\u2019s taking him so long, she can come and find him herself.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think she will, but if she did, that would be pretty great, because he\u2019s pretty sure he could get Aunt Yi to lower the wards keeping Aunt Baoshan out if she were <em>here</em> and then they could, you know, catch up with each other in their cave or whatever while he continues to hang out with his friends.</p>\n<p>Which is a thing he has now! Lots of them, even!</p>\n<p>He\u2019d met people on his travels, of course, but never anyone he had the time to get to know properly, not anyone as fun and interesting as all the disciples here. There are all the Jiang disciples, of course, and Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng especially. They\u2019re his absolute favorite.</p>\n<p>But Nie Huaisang is hilarious and has a surprisingly strong golden core for someone who can barely hold a sword properly. Wen Ning reminds him of a little, easily startled bird and he wants to feed him bread crumbs until he trusts him enough to ride on his shoulder, which is an especially ridiculous metaphor. But at least it gets Wen Qing to smile at him after she confronts him about why he\u2019s spending so much time hanging around her brother. Mianmian is also really cool, and so far is the only Jin cultivator that he doesn\u2019t want to punch on sight.</p>\n<p>Then again, Wen Chao is clearly the most punchable person here, so maybe he\u2019s not giving the Jin enough credit for not having Wen Chao. On the other hand, they have Jin Zixun, who\u2019s not much better, so.</p>\n<p>He thinks that Aunt Baoshan would really love Mianmian, but she\u2019s too old and has too much family for Wei Wuxian to kidnap her and drop her off at the mountain, which is a real shame.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks he might be his favorite, in a different way than the Jiangs are his favorite.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just so <em>angry</em> all the time. And suspicious. He's always watching Wei Wuxian, and has caught him the two times he\u2019s broken curfew to try and speak to Aunt Yi. He clearly doesn\u2019t believe that Wei Wuxian is really the Jiang\u2019s first disciple, which is rude and hurtful. It\u2019s also true, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji watches him in the library and glares at him in class whenever he gives an answer that Lan Qiren doesn\u2019t like. Which isn\u2019t his problem, he doesn\u2019t think. He\u2019s been taught by Baoshan Sanren, after all, what kind of answers do they expect him to give?</p>\n<p>Except after he has that thought, he tries to give answers that sound a little bit more textbook. Because Lan Qiren knew his mother, and possibly has heard these types of answers before. From his mother, who was also taught by Baoshan Sanren, and he really doesn\u2019t need him finding the similarities between those two things. Hopefully he\u2019s chalked up anything he\u2019s noticed so far to him being Cangse Sanren\u2019s son rather than Baoshan Sanren\u2019s student.</p>\n<p>The point is, even with the Lan\u2019s scrutiny and all the terrible rules, he\u2019s having <em>so much fun</em>. It can\u2019t last. As soon as he finds a way to leave without getting Jiang Yanli in too much trouble, he has to take it.</p>\n<p>He just hopes that Aunt Baoshan and Aunt Yi don\u2019t get too mad at him when they find out. He\u2019s also doing his best not think of what will happen with all his friends when he eventually does find an opening to leave, when he abandons them all to return to his mountain and Aunt Baoshan and they don\u2019t know where to find him or where he went.</p>\n<p>He hopes they forgive him too.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t decide what to make of Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>A rogue cultivator being named first disciple is a ridiculous idea, but he\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em>the son of Cangse Sanren, and her certainly\u00a0<em>acts\u00a0</em>Jiang, to say nothing of the close relationship he seems to have with Sect Leader Jiang\u2019s children. Jiang Cheng is notoriously difficult to get along with, with his only friend outside of his clan being Nie Huaisang, who\u2019s brother is known for having an even greater temper. Yet Wei Wuxian seems to get along with him easily, hanging off his shoulders and teasing him, never taking his anger to heart. It does not seem to be an affection easily faked.</p>\n<p>He should be focusing on demonstrating sword forms with the rest of his clansmen, but he\u2019s run these drills a thousand times and to Wei Wuxian is where his mind wanders these days.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Uncle snaps and Lan Wangji nearly drops his sword. \u201cSomething more interesting going on than learning Lan forms?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks up from where he\u2019d been whispering with Nie Huaisang and rolls his eyes. \u201cYou only teach the basics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course they do. As if they\u2019re going to go around teaching advanced clan forms to guest disciples even if they were capable of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think you\u2019re above the basics?\u201d Uncle demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I already know them,\u201d he answers. \u201cGo on, continue teaching, I won\u2019t distract everyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Uncle is staring at him now. \u201cYou already know them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods. He\u2019s barely been in Cloud Recesses a week and this is the first time they\u2019re going over forms. That\u2019s not possible.</p>\n<p>Uncle makes a sharp gesture towards the Lan who are demonstrating for the guest disciples. \u201cGo on then.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t back down, instead rolling his eyes and unsheathing his sword. He goes into place next to Lan Wangji, grinning at him as the drill starts up again.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian does it perfectly.</p>\n<p>His Jiang forms have been flawless, the smooth movements as he spared against his clansmen leading more to his claim of being first disciple than anything else. Yet as he moves through one Lan move then another, there\u2019s no hint of that. There is only sharp, perfect Lan precision.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Uncle barks. He\u2019s staring at Wei Wuxian, and he\u2019s not the only one. \u201cExplain yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulls a face. \u201cI was a rogue cultivator, I picked some stuff up. Don\u2019t be weird about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle\u2019s face goes a worrying shade of red, but before he can say anything, one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s sect sisters asks, \u201cHow did you do that? Even when I get the move right, you can still tell I\u2019m Jiang, but you looked like one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns, tapping his chin, before spinning away to stand at the front of the clearing. \u201cIt\u2019s actually more about understanding the styles than something physical. Once you can do that, it becomes easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gestures Jiang Cheng forward, who sighs but comes willingly enough, unsheathing his sword and settling into an opening Jiang stance.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian meets him, the two of them falling into a demonstration not unlike the one the Lan had just been giving. \u201cThe Jiang style is a conversation,\u201d Wei Wuxian says easily. The fluid movements between him and Jiang Cheng seem to match that, their moves constantly adjusting for each action the other person makes. \u201cIt\u2019s give and take and influenced by both the running river and the ocean waves. If a Jiang fighter retreats, don\u2019t follow. Like the ocean pulling back, it\u2019s only to prepare for a more devastating blow.\u201d He does the opposite of what he says, following as Jiang Cheng steps back, and ends with a sword at his throat.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng grins then pulls his blade back, sheathing it and stepping back into the disciples.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Jin style,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues and Mianmian steps forward without even having to be asked, \u201cis a dance.\u201d Lan Wangji glances at his uncle to see if he\u2019s going to do anything about Wei Wuxian taking control of his lesson, but he seems just as curious as the disciples. \u201cIt\u2019s all about who leads and who follows.\u201d Impossibly, Wei Wuxian slides into the Jin style. Lan Wangji isn\u2019t an expert, but it seems just as good as his Lan forms. The whispering happening among the Jin disciples supports that. He can almost see what Wei Wuxian means with the way he and Mianmian break apart and come together. He controls her movements with his own, then he goes from leading into following, forced into a more and more predictable pattern of moves as Mianmain presses her advantage until his sword falls to the ground.</p>\n<p>She picks it up for him, handing it back with a warm smile that makes his stomach turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Nie style is a meal.\u201d A Nie disciple stumbles forward after Nie Huaisang jabs her in the back with his fan. \u201cIt\u2019s about consumption, about overwhelming your opponent until they break apart and there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s blows don\u2019t have the same impact since he wields a blade rather than a saber, but it\u2019s impossible to know that looking at his form. There\u2019s no trading off of power, no adjustments made in deference of an opponent\u2019s skills. There\u2019s just a relentless, furious barrage of attacks. The Nie disciple knocks Wei Wuxian to the ground who grins and then says, \u201cDefeat in the Nie style is not about subjugation, but subsumption.\u201d</p>\n<p>She offers him a hand up, bows, then goes back over to Nie Huaisang.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Wen style is smoke on the wind,\u201d he says, and Wen Ning steps forward, giving him a smile that\u2019s not nearly as nervous as the one he gives everyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s about broadcasting one move to hide another. It\u2019s quick and tricky and when a Wen wins you\u2019re not going to notice until your insides are spilling onto the ground in front of you. Just as surprising and deadly as smoke in your lungs.\u201d Wen Ning\u2019s doesn\u2019t cut Wei Wuxian open, but he does execute several seemingly clumsy moves that reveal themselves to be hiding clever ones, and it ends with his sword pressed to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ribs.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian claps him on the shoulder and Wen Ning ducks his head before returning to his sister\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lan style,\u201d Wei Wuxian says and Lan Wangji is stepping forward, sword unsheathed, \u201cis a war.\u201d The description surprises him, but he doesn\u2019t let it distract him. Wei Wuxian\u2019s blows land perfectly and Lan Wangji should stay with the basic moves, but he has a suspicion, and he presses forward. Wei Wuxian meets him, counteracting him with moves far past basic and still perfectly executed. \u201cEvery Lan move is a finishing one. The don\u2019t waste anything. Their beauty hides their brutality.\u201d They\u2019re going further now, Lan Wangji not holding back, and still Wei Wuxian meets him, still his blows don\u2019t falter. \u201cLan only need one opening to end a fight. Permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji freezes, his sword pressed against Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest. His blade would have slid between his ribs and pierced his heart if he hasn\u2019t pulled the move.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is very close, his skin shining with sweat and his crooked grin doing something to the space underneath his own ribs.</p>\n<p>This is all impossible. No one should be this good at all the clans\u2019 forms, should know them this well, and yet Wei Wuxian stands here, an impossible boy.</p>\n<p>Maybe he really is Jiang.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli doesn\u2019t want Wei Wuxian to leave.</p>\n<p>She knows that he\u2019s going to, that he\u2019s only sticking around now to prevent her from getting in trouble. She knows that even if they make it through the season at Cloud Recesses without getting caught, he\u2019s still going to leave after.</p>\n<p>He claims it\u2019s to return to his life as a rogue cultivator, but Jiang Yanli thinks that he\u2019s lying. She thinks he\u2019s lying about a lot of things, but she doesn\u2019t hold it against him, she can\u2019t, even if she wanted to.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is a disciple of Baoshan Sanren, after all. Of course he isn\u2019t going to stay. Of course he\u2019s going to lie.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t have any proof, but she feels certain of it. Except he\u2019s not like Xiao Xingchen, he\u2019s not like his mother. He\u2019s planning to return to his master, somehow, even though she\u2019s always heard that it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only reason she can think of that he wouldn\u2019t want to stay with them.</p>\n<p>If he really was a rogue cultivator, he\u2019d have no reason to leave. He could join their clan and she could probably convince her parents to really make him their first disciple. He likes them, he\u2019s having fun and he\u2019s enjoying teaching them and spending time with them, and she wants to believe that if could stay, he would.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Yanli-jie,\u201d Wei Wuxian says cheerfully, twirling his sword around his wrists as he walks into her room, something that looks vaguely impossible. \u201cYou\u2019re late for dinner. Now A-Cheng will yell at both of us. And Lan Qiren, but I think A-Cheng\u2019s scowl might be a little bit better than his.\u201d</p>\n<p>She automatically looks to the sky and notices how the sun is far too low and resists the urge to curse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, A-Xian, I lost track of time. You didn\u2019t have to come get me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure I did,\u201d he says easily. \u201cWhat kind of brother would I be if I let you go hungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s going to miss him so much.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang almost buys the Jiang\u2019s wholes act and it\u2019s mostly because of Jiang Cheng.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s known Jiang Cheng his whole life. He\u2019s <em>liked</em> Jiang Cheng his whole life.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng yells and pouts and takes things too personally, but Nie Huaisang has grown up with Da-ge\u2019s terrible temper, so Jiang Cheng\u2019s doesn\u2019t to mean all that much to him. Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes and complains but does eventually give in to whatever fun idea Nie Huaisang has come up with and then when he\u2019s gotten them into too much trouble, Jiang Yanli comes along to get them out of it with a patient smile and a bowl of excellent soup. What\u2019s not to like? The Jiangs are great. The Wens and Lans are nearly intolerable for different reasons, but the Jiang is a major clan made of very strong fighters who are also up for a bit of fun as long as no one they like gets hurt.</p>\n<p>If Nie Huaisang didn\u2019t know for a fact that the Jiang all trained just as hard as the Nie, he might consider defecting. Jiang Yanli may already be engaged to Jin Zixuan, but Nie Huaisang could probably do something about that. He could do a lot worse than a clever wife that makes delicious food and a brother-in-law he already gets along with. It\u2019s too bad that Jiang Yanli actually likes her terrible fiance. He supposes someone has to.</p>\n<p>Well, there\u2019s Luo Qingyang, who\u2019s fantastic, but something has to be deeply wrong with her for to have been friends with Jin Zixuan for so many years. Maybe he\u2019s blackmailing her.</p>\n<p>The point is, he knows the Jiangs, and he knows Jiang Cheng. Most people outside of the Jiang do not get along with Jiang Cheng, with himself being a notable exception.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hangs off Jiang Cheng\u2019s shoulders. He calls him A-Cheng and corrects his sword forms and never reacts to any of his huffy outbursts. It takes most people years to get that comfortable with Jiang Cheng and even longer for him to get comfortable with them in return. Jiang Yanli dotes on Wei Wuxian and all the other Jiang disciples obey him and joke with him. There\u2019s almost nothing suspicious about his claim that he\u2019s the first disciple of Lotus Pier.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, that he\u2019s the son of Cangse Sanren that everyone thought died over a decade ago and no one has heard a single thing from since.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s good. He\u2019s too good. He seems to know everything that they\u2019re being taught already, is open and friendly and offers to tutor anyone from any clan that\u2019s having any trouble. Nie Huaisang tends to be wary of people at first, even if he doesn\u2019t show it, but Wei Wuxian is so open and friendly that Nie Huaisang feels himself relaxing halfway through his first real conversation with him.</p>\n<p>Even if Wei Wuxian had been going by a different name like some of the Jin cultivators speculated, he wouldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed. It\u2019s unheard of for a cultivator untethered to a clan to be as good as Wei Wuxian is without anyone talking about it.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the display of the sword forms, where Wei Wuxian casually showed off a mastery over every clans\u2019 forms that should be impossible for any one person to have, and yet he acts like it\u2019s nothing, like it\u2019s something that anyone could do in their spare time. Anyone who\u2019s spent any time training with the major clans would know how ridiculous that is, and someone can\u2019t be that good at the forms without training, no matter what Wei Wuxian says about just picking it up.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang knows that they\u2019re all lying, that Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t really who he says he is and that he\u2019s probably not the first disciple to Lotus Pier either.</p>\n<p>The only question then is what he\u2019s going to do about it.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>The answer is he\u2019s going to do nothing.</p>\n<p>He likes Wei Wuxian and the Jiang, and even if he doesn\u2019t totally trust Jiang Cheng\u2019s judgement, he does trust Jiang Yanli\u2019s. Whatever they and Wei Wuxian are up to, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s anything bad. Or if it is, it\u2019s probably something to do with them snooping around the Lan for some reason, which doesn\u2019t involve the Nie and therefor isn\u2019t his concern, and it\u2019s obvious that the Wen are the ones everyone really needs keep an eye on. Besides, Lan Qiren and Lan Wangji already seem to be keeping a close eye on Wei Wuxian. Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t seem to be that concerned, which really only validates Nie Huaisang\u2019s lack of concern, since out of all the Lan, he personally thinks that Lan Xichen is the smartest.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli and Lan Xichen aren\u2019t worried about it, so Nie Huaisang decides that he\u2019s not going to worry about it either.</p>\n<p>Instead he\u2019s going to see how much trouble he can convince Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng to get into with him before Jiang Yanli has to swoop in and bail them out like she always does.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian realizes pretty quickly that he may have gone overboard with the sword demonstration, and he really didn\u2019t need Jiang Cheng yelling at him to figure it out. Apparently the Jiang demonstration had been fine, but he\u2019d really pushed the bounds of believability when he\u2019d gone through the rest of them. In his defense, Aunt Baoshan had shown him the other clan styles when he was a kid, so how was he to know that demonstrating them all was going to be such a big deal? He really could copy moves just by seeing someone else perform them, after all. His explanation had seemed plausible to <em>him</em>. How quickly he picks things up does seem to be the one thing that makes his story somewhat credible, so he thinks he should get points for that one.</p>\n<p>Mostly everyone is being pretty chill about it, except for Lan Qiren and Lan Zhan, who seem determined to have eyes on him on every waking moment of the day. Which would be one thing, but he keeps on getting almost caught sneaking out at night, and intruding on his supposed to be sleeping moments just isn\u2019t fair. He personally thinks that he should be allowed to go sneaking around the grounds of Cloud Recesses if he wants to. He\u2019s been doing it for years anyway. Not that he can tell Lan Qiren that, obviously.</p>\n<p>If he ever manages to get past his babysitters to speak to Aunt Yi, he\u2019s going to give her a stern talking to about having really annoying descendants.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Wei Wuxian?\u201d Wen Ning is nearly his height but Wei Wuxian always automatically looks down before readjusting to look him in the eye. Something about the way he walks and talks always makes Wei Wuxian feel like he\u2019s shorter than he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says once he\u2019s aware he\u2019s let the silence stretch for far too long between them.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and gives him a fretful look that reminds him a little of Xingchen-ge from when he was a kid and Wei Wuxian was determined to get into as many of the old buildings and climb as many as the rickety stairs on top of the mountain as possible. Aunt Baoshan just taught him how to fall properly but Xingchen-ge still followed him around trying to get him to not do dangerous things.</p>\n<p>Instead they had just ended up doing the dangerous things together, which was probably at least a little safer since Xingchen-ge was older than him and had had a lot more training at the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he repeats, again after a too long pause, \u201cwhy do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning turns a little less fretful and raises his eyebrow in a way that reminds him of Wen Qing.</p>\n<p>Speaking of. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is watching for it, so he sees his small, almost imperceptible flinch at the question. \u201cPracticing her medical cultivation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe practices a lot,\u201d he says casually. \u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to be really good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s really good <em>because </em>she practices a lot,\u201d Wen Ning says earnestly.</p>\n<p>He hums but lets it drop, instead prodding Wen Ning into practicing archery with him again. He pushes it out of his mind until later, until he\u2019s lying alone in a clearing, shielding his eyes from the sun and trying to think through all of the things that no one talks about.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has been off the mountain plenty, but clan politics are complicated in ways that he doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience in. He\u2019s been on a lot of nighthunts on his own, and even more of them on the mountain with Aunt Baoshan, and in spite of all his history lessons he\u2019d thought that was the hardest thing about being a cultivator. He thinks the hardest thing might be this, instead, talking around the things that everyone knows and not getting too involved in things that shouldn\u2019t concern him. It\u2019s no wonder that Aunt Baoshan ran away to a mountain rather than dealing with any of it.</p>\n<p>The Wens are up to something.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not any sort of revelation or surprise or anything. Everyone knows that the Wens are up to something, because there\u2019s no other explanation for them sending their disciples to Cloud Recesses after decades of not doing so. However, it seems like everyone\u2019s attention is on Wen Chao, who is doing an excellent job of very loudly and obviously being the worst in every conceivable way. Just by existing he makes Jin Zixuan more tolerable, which Wei Wuxian personally find intolerable.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing is quiet and reserved and he\u2019s certain that she\u2019s the one that people should actually be worried about.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has been spent years sneaking around Cloud Recesses completely unnoticed. He knows exactly how many Lan typically patrol Cloud Recesses and what their patrol patterns are, even during the foreign disciple teaching seasons.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s more of them this year. And their patrol patterns are <em>different</em>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a big deal. As far as Wei Wuxian can tell, they haven\u2019t done much to change the way they do things ever since Aunt Yi locked herself in the cave. The jade token she gave Aunt Baoshan still gets him access to the grounds and they\u2019re still doing the same sword forms. Aunt Baoshan will leave the mountain occasionally to brush up on any new moves that are going around. Every generation the Jiang style basically starts anew, constantly refining and improving and adapting. The Wen do a pretty good job make up new stuff too, and the Jin are at least creative even if they\u2019re predictable.</p>\n<p>The Lan and the Nie don\u2019t change much, although Aunt Baoshan insists the Nie at least have a good reason.</p>\n<p>He likes the Jiang style partially because it\u2019s the easiest for him to move in consistently without slipping up. Aunt Baoshan just calls her own personal brand of martial art the mountain style, which he\u2019d always though was a terrible name for it since it didn\u2019t seem anything like a mountain. It\u2019s smooth and adaptable, something that could almost be Jiang, but it\u2019s a lot sharper than that, like the Lan. It lent itself to customization with it\u2019s looseness, and even when he and Aunt Baoshan and Xingchen-ge all performed the same moves, they didn\u2019t look exactly the same doing it.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian still can\u2019t risk anyone seeing him use it.</p>\n<p>It was one thing when he stuck to border towns or even city limits, where the chance of anyone having seen either his mother or Xingchen-ge fight enough to recognize the similar style was nearly impossible, but here it\u2019s a lot more dangerous.</p>\n<p>Xingchen-ge is really well known. More than that, Lan Qiren had known his <em>mother</em>.</p>\n<p>If he starts throwing around moves that he learned from Aunt Baoshan, then someone is going to notice, and it\u2019ll be really obvious to everyone that he\u2019s a disciple of Baoshan Sanren. He\u2019s not sure what happens after that, but he\u2019s assuming that it\u2019s nothing good.</p>\n<p>The point is that the change in the patrol patterns means that the Lans are on guard. It means they know that the Wen are only here because they\u2019re after something and they\u2019re not willing to let them have it. His guess is on one of the texts kept in the secret forbidden library, but since they\u2019d need a specific musical cultivation sequence to unlock it, he\u2019s not sure how they\u2019d get away with stealing anything from there without being noticed.</p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re trying to kill someone.</p>\n<p>Unless it\u2019s something personal, which it very well might be, the obvious target is Lan Xichen. He\u2019s nearly at the age where he can fully take over the role of clan leader from his uncle, so killing Lan Qiren would only do so much to disrupt the clan stability. But killing Lan Xichen before he can take power would be a big deal, although the payoff seems rather paltry. Lan Qiren would mourn, but he\u2019d probably continue leading the clan as he currently is, and would continue to do so until Lan Wangji could run the clan.</p>\n<p>The Wen could be planning on killing all three of them, Lan Qiren and Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji, but that seems a pretty ambitious for Wen Ruohan to entrust to his most obnoxious son or to his healer niece.</p>\n<p>Maybe Wen Ning is a secret assassin. Wei Wuxian has seen stranger things.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks, scowling as sits next to him. A moment later, Jiang Yanli folds to her knees on his other side, a basket of food on her arm.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gives the clearing a cursory glance to ensure they\u2019re alone before he asks, \u201cWhat do you think the Wens are really up to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian,\u201d Jiang Yanli sighs.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng freezes then looks around wildly, as if Wen spies are hiding in the trees. Which, he supposes they could be, but it seems unlikely. \u201cWhat are you thinking? Shut up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, look, we know they\u2019re up to something, right? And they know that we know that they\u2019re up to something. So I\u2019m not sure what the point of the pretense is exactly,\u201d he complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one wants to be the one to accuse the Chief Cultivator\u2019s clan of actions unbecoming of their sect,\u201d Jiang Yanli says calmly while Jiang Cheng sputters. \u201cIt could quickly get turned around and used against us. So perhaps we shouldn\u2019t accuse them of things we can\u2019t prove?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even accuse them of the things we can prove,\u201d Jiang Cheng grumbles. He knocks his shoulder into Wei Wuxian hard enough that he tips to the side and only doesn\u2019t fall over because he\u2019s pressed so closely to Jiang Yanli. \u201cKeep those kind of thoughts to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t thought about that. From all the stories, Wen Mao had been a good man and a good clan leader. He doesn\u2019t know how all his descendants had turned out so awful.</p>\n<p>Well, not all of them. Sneaky nefarious plans or no, Wen Qing and Wen Ning are pretty great.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he says and waits for Jiang Cheng to relax at his side before he continues, \u201cbut seriously though, what do you think they\u2019re trying to do here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he groans, but Wei Wuxian just laughs and doesn\u2019t complain when Jiang Cheng changes the subject.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji goes to the library in search of a particular book and finds Wei Wuxian sleeping in a patch of sunlight, a scroll abandoned at his side. He can\u2019t stand this anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know the Lan clan forms?\u201d he demands, towering over his prone form.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian opens a singly eye. Either he\u2019s a very calm sleeper or he hadn\u2019t been sleeping at all. \u201cHey Lan Zhan. What are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The use of his birth name sends a spear of fire through his stomach and straightens his spine. \u201cDon\u2019t be overly familiar. It\u2019s discourteous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, come on,\u201d he needles, shifting so he\u2019s on his stomach with his chin in his hands. \u201cAren\u2019t we friends, Lan Zhan? I\u2019d like if we were friends. You can call me Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>He swallows, his mouth suddenly dry. His voice comes out normally when he says, \u201cAnswer my question. How do you know the Lan clan forms?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian \u2013 Wei Ying shrugs, pushing himself up so he\u2019s at least sitting on the floor instead of lying on it. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first Lan I\u2019ve fought against, Lan Zhan. I\u2019ve picked stuff up over the years. That\u2019s what rogue cultivator do.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s very much not what rogue cultivators do. Most of the are barely qualified to handle low level hauntings. Those that possess real skill are typically cultivators that have trained in a clan and chose to leave it, or who were taught by masters who used to belong to a clan themselves. \u201cWho taught you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother taught me how to form my golden core as a child,\u201d he answers and Lan Wangji refuses to have a reaction to that. Cangse Sanren died when Wei Ying was five years old. It\u2019s unusual for children to develop a core that young. Lan Wangji had. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Wei Ying had too. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important part. Everything after that is just practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you get your sword?\u201d If Wei Ying won\u2019t answer his questions directly, maybe he can at least get something to go off of.</p>\n<p>Except his face pulls back into a grin so large and bright that Lan Wangji momentarily forgets to have any thoughts at all. \u201cI made it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d he says automatically, because it is. The ability to forge cultivation blades can only be achieved after a lifetime of study and with impeccable control.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pouts before laughing. \u201cOkay, okay, I only made the sheathe and handle. That\u2019s why it looks like this. If I\u2019d been older then I would have been able to make something better, with jewels or gold or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at the rough, unadorned wooden sheath with the simple pattern carved into it. \u201cI like your sword.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of complete silence before Wei Ying opens his mouth, eyes bright and a smirk curling around the corner of his lips. Lan Wangji steps backwards, nearly tripping over his robes like he hasn\u2019t since he was a child, and walks out of the library as quickly as he can without breaking the rule against running.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Mianmian who interrupts his instruction of the Jiang disciples to let him know that Jiang Yanli had collapsed and had been taken to the infirmary. Wei Wuxian had started running before he consciously realized that his legs were moving.</p>\n<p>He really wishes that Aunt Baoshan were here right now, because she knows a lot more about medical cultivation than he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be falling ill so often with a golden core,\u201d he tells Jiang Yanli, who\u2019s laid out in bed looking too pale and too small. The woman who\u2019d lifted her chin and lied to Lan Qiren\u2019s face shouldn\u2019t be stuck in a bed in the infirmary. This shouldn\u2019t be <em>normal</em>. How can he have been here for weeks and no one has even mentioned this to him?</p>\n<p>She looks down and Jiang Cheng glares at him. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t take that personally ever, but especially not now, with Jiang Yanli being ill. \u201cI know. But my core just isn\u2019t strong enough. I meditate every day, but it just \u2013 won\u2019t grow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian glances around, making sure there are no nosy Lan healers around, then holds out his hand. He\u2019s not Aunt Baoshan, but he\u2019s learned a couple tricks from her that he\u2019d prefer not to demonstrate around anyone else. Jiang Yanli doesn\u2019t hesitate to give him her wrist and he presses his fingers into it, listening. Her core is there, of course, and it\u2019s small. But a golden core of any size should mitigate most illnesses. Even child cultivators are spared most sicknesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange,\u201d he mutters. He gives her some of his own spiritual energy, watching carefully. It goes to her core and\u00a0 clings there, but instead of settling there and integrating properly, it dissipates.</p>\n<p>That. Shouldn\u2019t happen. He does it again, just in case it was a fluke, but he gets the same result.</p>\n<p>He leans over and picks up her sword. \u201cHere, take this out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hesitates and Jiang Cheng snaps, \u201cShut up! Why would you ask her that when she\u2019s sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYanli-jie can still use her sword when she\u2019s sick,\u201d he says, baffled. \u201cHer golden core is fine, it\u2019s her body that\u2019s flagging.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli shakes her head and places a hand on Jiang Cheng\u2019s arm. She licks her lips then squares her shoulders, looking him in the eye as she says quietly, \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to unsheathe my sword in years. I\u2019m too weak.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t make any\u00a0<em>sense</em>. Her sword is connected to her core. Unless her core has gotten significantly smaller, which really should happen at all, then there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t wield it. A sword increases in strength with its wielder. A sword should never be too powerful for its owner.</p>\n<p>He grasps the hilt of Jiang Yanli\u2019s sword and pulls it free.</p>\n<p>He nearly drops it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathes. The cultivation energy held in it is so thick and concentrated that it arcs across the blade in purple sparks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Jiang Cheng roars. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d He yanks the sword from him and Wei Wuxian knows he feels the same thing he does, watches his eyes go wide as he looks down at his sister\u2019s sword.</p>\n<p>He and Jiang Cheng have strong golden cores, so they can hold it easily. Lan Zhan and maybe Mianmian could do it too. But anyone else would struggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jiang Yanli asks, grabbing his arm. \u201cDid it hurt you? Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, mind whirling.</p>\n<p>A cultivator\u2019s sword is connected to their golden core. All the spiritual power that should have been nourishing Jiang Yanli golden core has instead been absorbed by her sword.</p>\n<p>He needs to speak to Lan Yi.</p>\n<p>That means he really needs to get past the patrols this time. It\u2019s for Jiang Yanli. It\u2019s <em>important</em>. He needs a distraction.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waits until after curfew then sneaks out of the room he shares with Jiang Cheng once he\u2019s asleep. He goes down a couple of hallways before creeping into the room Wen Chao is sharing with Wen Ning.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both asleep and he moves silently, covering Wen Ning\u2019s mouth with his hand. He wakes up instantly, panic quickening his breath and widening his eyes. He gets halfway through reaching for his sword before he realizes it\u2019s Wei Wuxian above him and he freezes and then slowly tilts his head to the side.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian steps back and raises a finger to his lips, giving Wen Chao\u2019s sleeping form a significant look. Wen Ning just nods, following him outside without a word. Wei Wuxian shuts the door behind them and says, \u201cI need a favor. It\u2019s going to be really inconvenient for you, and I can\u2019t explain why I\u2019m asking you to do this, but it\u2019s important.\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns for a moment before he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Ning!\u201d Wei Wuxian wails softly, grabbing at his face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just agree to things like that from people! What if it\u2019s something terrible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not people,\u201d he says patiently. \u201cYou are Wei Wuxian and you would not ask me to do something terrible. What do you need me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so precious. Wei Wuxian loves him. Wen Qing is going to beat him black and blue for this and he\u2019s going to have to let her.</p>\n<p>He sends Wen Ning off to distract the patrol guards, and he does not act like this is an insane request even though it is. Wei Wuxian gives him just enough time to attract too much attention before sneaking away himself, for the first time able to make a path to the cold springs without a suspicious Lan getting in his way.</p>\n<p>The forehead ribbon that Lan Yi gave him years ago is already wrapped around his wrist to prevent her guqin from attacking him. He\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t get searched when he got caught, because that would have been impossible to explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Wuxian,\u201d Lan Yi greets with the same warm smile she always gives him when he slips through the cold spring into her cave. \u201cYou\u2019re late. And empty handed. No wine this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Aunt Yi, who I love and respect very much,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cFunny story about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile slips into a frown. \u201cWhy are you wearing Lan guest disciple robes? Someone is going to notice those missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny story,\u201d he says again, because maybe if he just keeps repeating it then she\u2019ll believe it. He tells everything that\u2019s happened, from getting caught by Lan Zhan and claiming to be part of his father\u2019s old sect and Jiang Yanli covering for him, because she\u2019s awesome like that, and how he\u2019s spent the last several weeks pretending to the first disciple of the Yunmeng Jiang.</p>\n<p>She has her hand over her eyes, like she can\u2019t bear to look at him. This is why he likes her more. Aunt Baoshan would have already started beating him. \u201cHow did any of this seem like a good idea to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI never claimed it was a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi lowers her hand to pinch the bridge of her nose. He\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s progress or not. \u201cYou know that if you go around making yourself known to the clan heirs and leaders of all the major sects, it\u2019s going to be a little suspicious when you disappear back up the mountain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did say that I was a rogue cultivator,\u201d he says, even though yes, it has. He hasn\u2019t really decided how to handle that bit yet so instead he\u2019s elected to not think about it. \u201cAnyway, I have your letter from Aunt Baoshan, but it\u2019s going to be a while before I can get her yours. I need your help with something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds like you need my help with several things,\u201d she answers, but she listens patiently while he explains Jiang Yanli\u2019s illnesses and the strange way her core and sword are connected. By the end of it, she looks as perplexed as he feels, which is gratifying, but not particularly encouraging. \u201cI\u2019ll need to examine her myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave.\u201d Her captivity isn\u2019t voluntary like Aunt Baoshan\u2019s. Her presence in the cave is the only thing protecting her shard of the Yin Iron. No matter how often Aunt Baoshan tells her to just bring it to the mountain so they can guard it together, Aunt Yi still insists that she\u2019d be betraying her clan by taking away the shard that was entrusted to them and she couldn\u2019t possibly go against the current sect leader like that.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is of the opinion that if Lan Qiren wants to stop two immortals from absconding with the Yin Iron, he\u2019s more than welcome to try, but no one ever asks him for his opinion about these things.</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi doesn\u2019t roll her eyes, but it\u2019s a near thing. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that, thank you. You\u2019ll have to bring her here. I\u2019ll give you another ribbon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring her here,\u201d he repeats dubiously. \u201cHow am I supposed to explain that? How are you going to explain that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did she plan to explain away her decision to protect you when she didn\u2019t even know you?\u201d she returns. \u201cShe trusted you and she didn\u2019t even know you. Now you know her and you won\u2019t trust her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about me!\u201d he snaps, and his throat feels too tight and scratchy, all of a sudden, and water must be getting into his eyes because everything is all blurry. \u201cMy secrets aren\u2019t just my secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Wuxian,\u201d Aunt Yi sighs and then her strong arms come around his back. He resists only for a moment before melting into her embrace, pressing his face into her shoulder and letting her hold him like he\u2019s a little kid again. \u201cI thought you knew better. You don\u2019t have live as me and Baoshan live. You don\u2019t have to choose one life over the other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I tell the truth, then I\u2019ll be putting you and Aunt Baoshan in danger,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be making your lives harder. It\u2019ll make it harder for me to go home. Your lives are hard enough already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s hard about my life?\u201d she scolds. \u201cI have the love of a good woman and a child of my heart. You are Baoshan\u2019s and so you are mine. Who would I be if I let your friend suffer just because I might be put at risk? I wouldn\u2019t be someone that was worthy of either you or Baoshan then.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face is a mess, so he keeps it pressed against her. \u201cThank you, Aunt Yi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSilly boy,\u201d she says softly. \u201cDo you like the Jiang? Do you want to stay with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tightens his hold on her, but she doesn\u2019t react. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to leave Aunt Baoshan yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rubs his back and says, \u201cBring me Jiang Yanli first and then you should go home and talk to Baoshan. We had to choose once and I know that neither of us wants that for you. We\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know that there\u2019s a solution to this, no matter how much Aunt Yi wants there to be, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. He stays in the cave with her until dawn, telling her of everything that\u2019s happened on the mountain and the rumors he\u2019s heard of Xingchen-ge since he\u2019s saw her last.</p>\n<p>Once curfew is over and the patrols have moved back to just the perimeter, Wei Wuxian sneaks back through Cloud Recesses, bouncing into bed and managing to nap for a whole hour before Jiang Cheng is shaking him awake.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli is mostly recovered when Wei Wuxian slips into her room with a serious look on his face that she doesn\u2019t like. She hasn\u2019t known him long, but it\u2019s long enough to know that he\u2019s always smiling, so if he\u2019s not, it\u2019s something serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to speak to Yanli-jie about something,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>The two Jiang disciples who share a room with her don\u2019t bother to even check with her before bowing and leaving the room. She thinks she should be upset by that, but instead it just makes her feel warm and content. Wei Wuxian has taken up the mantle of first disciple, of one them, so seamlessly that they all act like it\u2019s true even when no one\u2019s watching.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, A-Xian?\u201d she asks, reaching out to push his hair behind his ear. The doctors want her to not spend too much time on her feet for the next couple of days, but there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t drag a chair into the kitchen to get some cooking done. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t eat enough at meals because the food here is, admittedly, terrible, and he\u2019s going to be start losing weight if he keeps it up.</p>\n<p>He puts her hands in between her own and she\u2019s really starting to get concerned when he says, \u201cThere\u2019s someone who I want to take a look at you. Someone who I think might be able to figure out why you\u2019re getting sick all the time. But you\u2019ll have to keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her heartrate ticks up. He can only be talking about one person. \u201cWon\u2019t someone notice that we\u2019re gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t know where Baoshan Sanren lives, but she doubts it\u2019s close enough to Cloud Recesses that they could get there and back without being noticed.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth drops open in outrage. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s you\u2019re only question? Yanli-jie! Aren\u2019t you going to ask where I\u2019m taking you to, or what they\u2019ll be doing to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust you, A-Xian,\u201d she says honestly.</p>\n<p>He starts muttering curses and even mentions Wen Ning for some reason before his back straightens and he says, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to need someone to cause a scene for us so we can sneak out. They can\u2019t be part of our sect, because if they get caught you and A-Cheng are going to be summoned, but then you won\u2019t be there. I don\u2019t suppose you have any blackmail against Nie Huaisang?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mouth twitches at the corners. \u201cWe don\u2019t need blackmail. I\u2019m just going to ask him and he\u2019s going to agree because it\u2019s easier than telling me no. Besides, he loves causing problems for Lan Xichen. He and Sect Leader Nie are good friends, which means Nie Huaisang gets away with a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian almost feels bad about causing problems for Lan Xichen. He\u2019s just so nice. He\u2019d been nice even when Lan Zhan had dragged him in front of them as an intruder. Luckily, he knows that Jiang Yanli is right, and Nie Huaisang thrives on causing problems for Lan Xichen. It\u2019s the only explanation for why he keeps bringing birds into lessons when he could at least leave them in his room.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Yi doesn\u2019t know what exactly she was expecting Wuxian to do, but she can\u2019t help but laugh when he tumbles into her cave with a girl blindfolded and clinging to him while he holds her in his arms. The girl is holdingboth their swords pressed between their bodies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asks breathlessly before letting go of Wuxian so she can frantically pat him down. \u201cAre you hurt? It seemed like we were getting tugged around but you were the only one hitting anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was on purpose,\u201d he says, slowly settling her onto her feet and bracing her when she slips against the slick surface of the cave floor. The ribbon Lan Yi had given Wuxian last time is tied around her neck while his is around his wrist, as usual. He reaches out and unties the scrap of fabric he\u2019d tied around her eyes. \u201cJiang Yanli, meet Lan Yi.\u201d</p>\n<p>She blinks several times, her eyes adjusting to the light of the cave before she notices her sitting next to her guqin. \u201cHello,\u201d she says uncertainly, looking very young as she stands there wet and shivering.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d she says, equally soft. She holds out her hands. \u201cCome here, I can\u2019t do anything to help you when you\u2019re all the way over there.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t move and Wuxian nudges her forward. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Aunt Yi is going to help. She\u2019ll know what to do, Yanli-jie, she\u2019s like a thousand years old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d she says, keeping her hands extended.</p>\n<p>Except instead of coming closer, Jiang Yanli turns motionless. Her lips move without making a sound for a moment before she says, \u201cLan Yi. Like \u2013 like <em>the </em>Lan Yi? Lan An\u2019s granddaughter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d she says patiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re dead!\u201d she blurts out before gasping and covering her mouth with her hands.</p>\n<p>Wuxian starts laughing, because he\u2019s a terrible child, and she sends forward a quick bit of energy from her guqin that\u2019s just concentrated enough to get past the protections of the forehead ribbon. He stumbles and falls back into the water. Jiang Yanli bends down to help him, but he pushes himself up still laughing and wraps a damp arm around her shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s not dead, it\u2019s okay. She\u2019s not a ghost or anything, just old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian!\u201d Jiang Yanli hisses before falling into a deep, formal bow. \u201cLady Lan. It\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that\u2019s really unnecessary. You\u2019re a friend of Wuxian and that means you\u2019re a friend of mine. Please come closer. He tells me that you fall ill often?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, finally coming closer. Wei Wuxian hovers behind her until she\u2019s close enough for Lan Yi to take her arm. Then he sits on the ground close enough to the guqin to pluck at it absently. She\u2019s taught him to play over the years, but he only practices when he\u2019s with her, so he\u2019s not as good at it as he could be. \u201cIt\u2019s happened ever since I was a child. It doesn\u2019t usually last long and it happens less now.\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods and pulls up Jiang Yanli\u2019s sleeve to her elbows, shifting her arm so her wrist is turned upward. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli nods, not hesitating even though her face is a mix of awe and fear, and Lan Yi can\u2019t help but like her. She\u2019s the only person that Lan Yi has met besides Wuxian for so long, and she\u2019s someone who protected Wuxian and Lan Yi is going to do her best to return her kindness with her own.</p>\n<p>She presses her fingers against Jiang Yanli\u2019s wrist. It takes her only a moment to confirm what Wuxian had told her, that the girl\u2019s core is small but very there, and strong enough that she should be immune to most minor illnesses rather than highly susceptible to them. She repeats the experiment Wuxian had and pushes a small amount of her spiritual energy into her core. However, Lan Yi a lot more sensitive to the shifts of a spiritual energy than Wuxian is. It\u2019s a skill that comes with time, and she\u2019s had little else.</p>\n<p>Wuxian had said that the spiritual energy had clung there for a moment before it disappeared, but that\u2019s not quite right. Everyone\u2019s spiritual energy is slightly different and bodies aren\u2019t meant to make use of energy different than their own. When foreign spiritual energy is introduced, the core processes it in order to make use of it. It happens without conscious thought and is something even the cores of children do.</p>\n<p>Except Jiang Yanli\u2019s core does something different.</p>\n<p>Her core converts it into a spiritual energy incompatible with her own and then that spiritual energy is pushed outside of her body, is rejected as something foreign and different.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see your sword?\u201d she asks, a suspicion already forming in her mind.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli holds it out to her, her face pinched in worry. Lan Yi smooths her own expression, giving her a reassuring smile before grabbing it and unsheathing the blade.</p>\n<p>Impressive.</p>\n<p>She swings the sword through the air, noting with approval the crackle of energy going down the blade. She reaches for Jiang Yanli\u2019s wrist once more and sends another trickle of spiritual energy into her core. A moment later that same trickle arcs across the sword in a shower of purple sparks.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi thinks she knows what happened, although it will be impossible to know for sure without the girl\u2019s parents. Either way, she believes she knows how to fix it, but it\u2019s dangerous, and even if she succeeds, she doubts that Jiang Yanli will ever have a golden core strong enough to wield her own blade.</p>\n<p>She wishes Baoshan were here. Perhaps it would be better if Wuxian brings Jiang Yanli to the mountain. Baoshan has seen more of the world than her and will know for sure, and has a lot more experience with medical cultivation than she does. Although, Lan Yi\u2019s past attempts at manipulating resentful energy might give her an edge over Baoshan when it comes to doing this correctly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not something that can be attempted tonight at any rate. Jiang Yanli will need at least a couple weeks to recover and the eldest child to the Jiang sect being bedbound for that long will garner too much attention and cause too many rumors that she\u2019s assuming her clan won\u2019t want to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Yi?\u201d Wuxian asks, his hands paused over her guqin and his eyebrows pushed together. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles, resheathing the sword and patting Jiang Yanli\u2019s hands, trying to figure out a way to say all the things she needs to without alarming either her or Wuxian.</p>\n<p>Her thoughts are interrupted by someone else tumbling into the cave. Lan Yi reaches for her own sword but her guqin comes to life first, letting out a battering ram of energy at the intruder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Qing!\u201d Wuxian shouts as the new girl pushes herself to her feet only to be knocked to her knees by the guqin. He pulls at the strings, attempting to soften the blows, but this particular song can only be stopped by her own hand.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli gasps and runs forward. \u201cWen Qing, come here! Let me help!\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl, Wen Qing, tries to stand but is hit with another wave of energy. She doesn\u2019t fall over this time, but she does stagger, and blood leaks out from her nose. Lan Yi\u2019s not sure what\u2019s happening, but she moves toward the guqin to cut it off before it can strike a third time, gritting her teeth as pain reverberates up her arm. She\u2019d forgotten how damaging this could be to people who aren\u2019t strong enough to withstand her guqin\u2019s initial blows and the girl doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019ll stay conscious through one more strike. Wuxian shoots her a grateful look before rushing over to the girls.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli unties the forehead ribbon from around her throat and grabs Wen Qing\u2019s hand, clumsily tying the ribbon around both their wrists. Lan Yi lets go of the guqin and the next wave of energy passes harmlessly through Wen Qing.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli grips Wen Qing\u2019s hand and asks anxiously, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Wuxian demands, and his voice is harsh but his hands are gentle as he wipes the blood from her face.</p>\n<p>She looks dazed by everything that\u2019s happened, but she swallows and lifts her head. She steps away from Wuxian, but Jiang Yanli stays right by her side thanks to the ribbon binding their hands together.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing\u2019s voice almost doesn\u2019t shake when she says, \u201cI\u2019m here for the Yin Iron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning doesn\u2019t ask questions because nothing can get his sister to tell him something if she\u2019s made up her mind. He knows something is happening and it\u2019s not good and she\u2019s worried about it, but that\u2019s all he\u2019s been able to pry from her.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reminds him of his sister. He keeps a lot of secrets and talks about none of them, and maybe that should make Wen Ning trust him less, but it\u2019s almost a comfort. There is a difference between dishonesty and manipulation and Wei Wuxian has plenty of the former and none of the later. Qing-jie likes him but doesn\u2019t want to, worried she\u2019s falling for some sort of trick, but Wen Ning doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a trick. He thinks Wei Wuxian is just likeable and that\u2019s why they like him.</p>\n<p>When Qing-jie comes to him in the middle of the night, soaked and pale and freezing to the touch, and says, \u201cWei Wuxian is going to help us,\u201d he doesn\u2019t know whether to be vindicated or concerned.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure what Wei Wuxian is supposed to be helping them with and his sister doesn\u2019t tell him.</p>\n<p>But she does send off a message home when she thinks he\u2019s not looking. It makes unease curl on the bottom of his stomach, but \u2013 but she\u2019s his older sister. She\u2019s always protected him and their family before, and he has to assume that this is in service to the same.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning acts like he saw nothing and trusts in his sister. \u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian escorts Wen Qing and Jiang Yanli back to their rooms then takes probably too many risks to duck back into the cold spring into Aunt Yi\u2019s cave. She\u2019s still sitting in the center of the cave in a meditative pose, just like he left her.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t an argument he\u2019d wanted to have in front of the others, but, unfortunately, it\u2019s one that he feels they need to have.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should go to the mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi opens her eyes, something weary in the slant of her mouth.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve had this conversation before, but not like this, not with circumstances like these. \u201cThe Wen are after the Yin Iron. They know it\u2019s here. The best thing you can do is get it someplace they can\u2019t possibly get to, and then you\u2019ll be able to handle the Wen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have other pieces,\u201d she says. \u201cEven without this one, they\u2019re a threat. One it\u2019s my responsibility to neutralize.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t roll his eyes only because he knows that will lead to an entirely separate argument than the one he wants to have. \u201cAnd how exactly are you going to do that from within this cave when the Wen are all the way in Nightless City?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how are you planning to retrieve Wen Qing\u2019s people when they\u2019re just as far?\u201d she asks. \u201cThey\u2019ll notice you missing. Maybe it won\u2019t trigger anyone\u2019s suspicions. Maybe it will.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, they share an equally frustrated look. They\u2019d assured Wen Qing they would help, and they will follow through on that promise, but they hadn\u2019t gone into how exactly they were going to do that. Wei Wuxian wants to secure Wen Qing\u2019s people before they do anything, but Aunt Yi believes that if they deal with the Yin Iron quickly, her people won\u2019t be in danger at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of us has to go,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be me. Even if me leaving wouldn\u2019t be suspicious, I \u2013 I can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pauses, her frustration softening. \u201cWuxian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey call me Senior Brother Wei,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve been pretending to be the Jiang\u2019s first disciple for months, and even besides them there\u2019s Nie Huaisang and Mianmian and even your annoying, uptight descendants. They\u2019re my friends. I care about them. I can\u2019t leave them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if by leaving them you\u2019re helping them?\u201d she asks gently.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks around the damp, lonely cave that Aunt Yi has lived in for centuries, as penance for a crime no one remembers. \u201cI don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want to leave the people I love to keep them safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi gives him a long, considering look. Then she walks over to her guqin, picks it up, and pushes it in his hands. \u201cI will go to Baoshan. We will handle this. But you know that they\u2019re likely already moving, and we might not be able to handle both before they arrive.\u201d This is true. But Wei Wuxian is a lot more confident about Cloud Recesses ability to stand against several dozen Wen rather than the whole clan, which is what Lan Yi will be facing. \u201cWhile I\u2019m gone, you must keep Cloud Recesses safe. There are songs in the secret library. You will need them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s forbidden,\u201d he says, bewildered as he tries to hand her guqin back to her. \u201cWhy are you giving this to me? You\u2019ll need it! I can play my own!\u201d</p>\n<p>She gives him a stern look and reaches out to unwind the ribbon from around his wrist. She steps even closer, lifting her arms to tie it around his forehead in the same place all the Lans wear theirs. \u201cYou are my child in every way that matters. Nothing here is forbidden to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pretty sure Lan Qiren won\u2019t agree with that, but he\u2019s too busy blinking away the pressure behind his eyes to point that out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>When his sister tells him everything that\u2019s happened, Jiang Cheng wants to get mad at her for not telling him what she was doing before letting Wei Wuxian drown her, but he\u2019s too busy wrapping his mind around the rest of it.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian walks into their room and he demands, \u201cWhat were you thinking doing something so stupid without me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait, that wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d meant to say.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli raises her sleeve to hide her smile while Wei Wuxian freezes, looking guilty until he processes what Jiang Cheng has said, then he shouts, \u201cHey! That was a really logical thing to do at the time! I would have brought you if I\u2019d known it was going to end up being a stupid thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hates that that mollifies him. \u201cHow did you even know there was an immortal secretly living in a cave? Did you just fall into it while sneaking around after the Wen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His nose scrunches up. \u201cNo, don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ve known Aunt Yi since I was twelve and I found her on purpose.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI maybe shouldn\u2019t have told you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>That answers a question that he hadn\u2019t even really bothered wondering about. \u201cIs that what you were doing sneaking around Cloud Recesses in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI try and visit at least every other month,\u201d he says, nonchalant, as if that isn\u2019t a completely insane thing to say. \u201cTheir security sucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he says. \u201cShould that be something we\u2019re concerned with? Considering the Wen are maybe sort of planning to attack Cloud Recesses and steal their stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian scrunches his nose. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s something for <em>me</em> to worry about, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng waits, and when no reasonable explanation is forthcoming, he huffs and demands, \u201cOkay? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment when he thinks that Wei Wuxian is going to lie to him again and he\u2019ll have to hit him, but then his lips quirk up in a conspiratory grin. \u201cWant to get in some trouble?\u201d</p>\n<p>No! Of course he doesn\u2019t! His mother\u2019s going to kill him twice over if she ever finds out about all the things he\u2019s already done.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says firmly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian puts him in a headlock and he only sort of tries to get out of it.</p>\n<p>He thinks this is what having a brother would be like.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Jiang siblings are up to something.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang recognizes the signs, because usually <em>he\u2019s</em> the one pulling them into a mess of his own making. But now here he is, being perfectly well behaved and polite and not causing any sort of commotion that would upset his brother more than he normally does, and what does he get for it? Excluded from whatever mischief is currently going on. Him! Of all people! He <em>loves </em>mischief!</p>\n<p>He\u2019s worked himself into a proper snit about it when he walks into his room to see Wei Wuxian sitting on his bed and flipping through his porn collection.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are good,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and holds up a page from his most recent acquisition. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is anatomically possible, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not that flexible, that\u2019s a you problem,\u201d he sniffs, huffily folding his hands in his sleeves like he\u2019s seen A-Yao do whenever Da-ge really pisses him off. His first instinct is to whine and flail around like he does with his brother, but he knows that Wei Wuxian will find it funny and it won\u2019t irritate him at all, which makes it worthless.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian frowns and turns the book sidewise, then tilts his head in the same direction, as if that makes any difference at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks. Normally he would be happy to analyze the artistic merits of porn with Wei Wuxian, but he normally isn\u2019t keeping secrets from him.</p>\n<p>Well, obviously he\u2019s keeping secrets from him, and everyone else too, but this is different. They\u2019re <em>doing things</em> and they haven\u2019t even invited him! What are they up to? Drinking? Sneaking around? Stealing?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s done all those things before! He could help!</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you know that favor A-Li asked you for?\u201d he prompts.</p>\n<p>That makes him feel almost properly bitter. Jiang Yanli had said very firmly and sternly that this was a huge secret and that he couldn\u2019t tell anyone what he was doing it and who he was doing it for. Not even Jiang Cheng would know.</p>\n<p>But apparently Wei Wuxian does. He would have done Wei Wuxian a favor too, if he\u2019d just asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously I know about the favor I was asked for,\u201d he says and tries his very best not to snap. It\u2019s only sort of successful. It actually makes him sort of sounds like A-Yao when he\u2019s talking to some of their higher ranked disciples.</p>\n<p>Oh, hm, that\u2019s probably not good. He should keep an eye on that. A-Yao doesn\u2019t like going to Da-ge with problems, but dealing with problems is his brother\u2019s whole job, and he\u2019s much better at it when he knows what those problems are.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was actually kind of for me and I need your help,\u201d he says. That drains away most of Nie Huaisang\u2019s ire and if it didn\u2019t, Wei Wuxian\u2019s tone would. He sounds serious. He almost never sounds serious. \u201cI think something is bad is going to happen and I need to make sure it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this why you\u2019re in Cloud Recesses?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Some of Wei Wuxian\u2019s seriousness melts into offense. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m the first disciple of Lotus Pier!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Nie Huaisang says, but it comes out fonder than it would have a few moments ago.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian huffs but his frown reluctantly curls into a smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need your help. You\u2019re the smartest person here. Well, besides me. And maybe Lan Xichen.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s definitely smarter than Lan Xichen. Not that anybody is supposed to know that. No one\u2019s supposed to know he\u2019s smart at all, because smart people have to run drills and do a lot work that he\u2019d prefer not to do. \u201cAnd Jiang Yanli.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are both way dumber than Yanli-jie,\u201d he says seriously. It\u2019s a different sort of smart than the one they\u2019re talking about, but it\u2019s an important kind too. \u201cSo, are you going to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sniffs, raising his nose, but he knows he\u2019s not fooling him. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you asked. What do you need to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian actually looks sheepish and Nie Huaisang feels his first stab of real worry. He literally laughs in Lan Qiren\u2019s face and has never even flinched when facing the other disciples. What could possibly put that look on his face?</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to break into the Lan\u2019s secret library to do some research.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not <em>really</em> breaking in, because I know how to get in, but no one can know I\u2019m doing it. Besides you, of course. And Yanli-jie. And A-Cheng.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang regrets drinking all of his smuggled booze last night when he was busy sulking. He could really use a drink right about now.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reaches into his sleeve and pulls out a bottle of Emperor\u2019s Smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d he demands. Lan Wangji has been watching Wei Wuxian like a hawk. He really needs to lighten up.</p>\n<p>He preens for a moment longer before admitting, \u201cWen Ning got it for me. No one ever suspects him. I have to assume it\u2019s the baby face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a baby face,\u201d he mutters resentfully but accepts the bottle with a minimal amount of pouting.</p>\n<p>This is a big deal. He doesn\u2019t think Wei Wuxian is up to anything malicious, but this isn\u2019t some harmless fun, or something that he can get involved in without consequences. Helping someone get past the security around the forbidden library could damage the relationship between the Nie and Lan for years, if not harming it permanently. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know much about clan relations, no matter his claim of being the first disciple of Lotus Pier, or even of being a rogue cultivator. Rogue cultivators <em>have </em>to keep up to date on the latest gossip, otherwise they run the risk of offending clans by assisting in one territory and not the other, or by crossing boundaries they shouldn\u2019t. Song Lan is notorious for keeping meticulous track of that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>If Wei Wuxian was who he said he was, he would know that the Nie and Lan are close, that Nie Huaisang\u2019s brother and Lan Xichen are as good of friends as two eventual clan heads were allowed to be. That means Nie Huaisang knows the forbidden library exists, and he knows that the knowledge of how to open it is <em>only</em> given to high ranking main family members.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had said that it wasn\u2019t really breaking in, because he knows how to get in on his own.</p>\n<p>Only a high ranking Lan could have given him that information.</p>\n<p>Except that there\u2019s no high ranking Lan who would go against Lan Qiren, and especially not using Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>For every question about him that\u2019s answered, it seems like three more pop up in their place. Nie Huaisang almost wants to bring Lan Xichen into this, because if there really is a chance that something seriously bad will happen, then he deserves to know about it.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s too many variables. What he doesn\u2019t know outweighs what he does, so he\u2019ll wait, and watch, and be ready to beg forgiveness for not asking permission.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli could be wrong. Maybe her theory isn\u2019t right. Being the disciple of Lan Yi could explain so much of Wei Wuxian, after all.</p>\n<p>Except all the things it doesn\u2019t. Like how he even met Lan Yi in the first place when she hasn\u2019t left her cave in centuries.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s more sure of herself than ever. Wei Wuxian is the disciple of Baoshan Sanren, just like his mother had been. She doesn\u2019t really understand how Lan Yi got involved, but it makes more sense that two immortals know each other than that Wei Wuxian stumbled across one who has no connection to him and no one else seems to even know is still alive.</p>\n<p>It gives her a terrible idea. Lan Yi has gone off to do \u2013 something, to fix this mess with the Wen somehow. She\u2019s left Wei Wuxian behind to defend Cloud Recesses, to patch a hole in the Lan security system that Wei Wuxian has been exploiting himself for years, she\u2019s left him behind to keep everyone safe in her stead.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not fair.</p>\n<p>She knows how strong Wei Wuxian. She\u2019s felt the power of his golden core beneath her hand, had seen him perfectly execute moves that clan seniors would struggle with.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s only her brother\u2019s age, and this is too much to put on him, and he\u2019s barely letting them help. Their disciples will listen to him, but they\u2019re all only juniors, and Lan Yi hadn\u2019t trusted that the Lan seniors would be enough to keep everyone safe, so it\u2019s \u2013 too much. It\u2019s too much to put on one very powerful boy who\u2019s willing to do everything he can to help them, to help Wen Qing, because doing what\u2019s right is more important to him than his own safety.</p>\n<p>It makes her so <em>mad</em> sometimes that he\u2019s not really one of them. He\u2019s perfect for the Jiang. He\u2019d be happy with them.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not her choice to make. Considering who his master is, maybe it\u2019s not even Wei Wuxian\u2019s. Either way, there\u2019s nothing she can do about it.</p>\n<p>This, however, she can do something about.</p>\n<p>If she\u2019s right, then he\u2019s the perfect for person to ask for help. If she\u2019s wrong, then she\u2019ll take the embarrassment and the scolding. And, well \u2013 he\u2019s rumored to be very skilled. If something bad does happen, having him there can only help.</p>\n<p>She almost asks Luo Qingyang, but it\u2019s not right of her to ask her to keep a secret from her friend. So she slips away to the Jin rooms and looks Jin Zixuan in the eye to say, \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d She sweeps her gaze over the room, stopping briefly on Jin Zixun, and adds pointedly, \u201cAlone.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not often that she puts on the airs of her rank, shoulders back and an arrogant tilt to her head. But she\u2019s just as much a clan heir as he is.</p>\n<p>At least until they marry. <em>If </em>they marry. She\u2019s written him before, after their betrothal was announced, but he\u2019s never written her back. She promised her brother it didn\u2019t bother her.</p>\n<p>She lied.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan frowns at her, but she\u2019s not willing to back down. Eventually his gaze slides away from her like always, but he says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Zixun. You can go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun scowls at her as he passes and Jiang Yanli resists the urge to roll her eyes. He has nothing on her mother, after all. She waits until she can\u2019t hear his footsteps anymore to say, \u201cI need a favor. I need you to send a messenger butterfly to someone, and I need you to keep it a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does look at her then. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m asking you to,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>She won\u2019t explain herself. She won\u2019t beg. If he refuses, there are other ways she can go about this, other things she can do to try and help Wei Wuxian that don\u2019t involve compromising herself in front of her future husband more than she already has.</p>\n<p>His face twitches, his jaw minutely moving from side to side as he obviously grinds his teeth and tries to pretend that he isn\u2019t. She makes sure her own expression is perfectly serene and unmoving, content to wait here for as long as it takes him to make up his mind.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan crosses his arms, then uncrosses them. \u201cFine. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s a struggle to keep her voice neutral.</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t thought that he cared about what she wanted.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The world has changed since Lan Yi saw it last.</p>\n<p>Land is different. Cities are different. The paths she remembers walking are no longer there. Style has changed, and even the language has shifted. She does not recognize every word she overhears, even if she can understand it based on the words that surround it.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t occur to her to change her clothes or her appearance until a day into her travel and then she figures it\u2019s not worth the effort. By the time any possible rumors of a traveling Lan woman that doesn\u2019t match the description of any current clan members reaches the elders\u2019 ears, it won\u2019t matter anymore.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s been breathing damp air for centuries and the wind whipping the breath from her lungs is nearly a relief. She hadn\u2019t thought of herself as weak, in that cave. She\u2019d cultivated to immortality and the strength of her golden core was enough to sustain her life and protect her worst mistake.</p>\n<p>But she thinks perhaps that cave wore at her slowly. She\u2019d practiced her guqin and her sword and hadn\u2019t allowed her skill to lapse, but this is something different, something deeper. She hadn\u2019t felt weak before, but she feels <em>strong</em> now, just three days of sunshine and clean air restoring to her something that she hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d lost.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had given her exact instructions. She thinks she could have found her way even without them.</p>\n<p>If she\u2019s spent the past century slowly eroding herself, Baoshan has spent it doing the opposite. She was already ancient when Lan Yi met her, already an immortal of immense, nearly mythical power.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s stronger now. Lan Yi knows the feel of her cultivation energy and the pulse of her golden core, and she must know how to restrain it, but it\u2019s likely she doesn\u2019t bother when it\u2019s just her on her mountain. The locals probably don\u2019t even notice. Why would they? It must just feel like part of the landscape to them.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi steps onto the path up the mountain, the one no one is supposed to be able to see, but even after all this time, Baoshan\u2019s tricks are familiar to her. She\u2019s barely made it past the thicket of trees when Baoshan is landing in front of her, stepping off her sword before it\u2019s even reached the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat on earth took you so-\u201d she starts, then cuts herself off, her face draining of color until she\u2019s nearly as white as her hair. Lan Yi\u2019s not sure what reaction she expected, but it wasn\u2019t this. Baoshan is terrified, and Lan Yi doesn\u2019t understand why until she asks, \u201cWhat happened to Wuxian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d she says, internally scolding herself for not anticipating this. Of course that would be her first thought at seeing her after Wuxian\u2019s been away from home so long. \u201cNothing\u2019s happened to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of being reassured, Baoshan\u2019s eyes fill with tears. She blinks to keep them from falling. \u201cAre you a ghost?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, Baoshan.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi crosses the distance between them, grasping Baoshan around the waist with one arm and raising the other cradle her face. It\u2019s been so long, but her body remembers this. She tilts her head to press her lips against Baoshan\u2019s, opening her mouth into her gasp to let Baoshan deepen the kiss. Baoshan\u2019s hands grip her hips, pulling her impossibly closer, and it\u2019s not until Lan Yi tastes Baoshan\u2019s tears on her tongue that she breaks the kiss. She presses their foreheads together and murmurs, \u201cDo I feel like a ghost?\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan laughs, too watery still, and Lan Yi dips her head down so she can kiss her once more, like she can swallow that sound out of Baoshan\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s several seconds later that Baoshan manages to ask, breathless, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Yi smiles, but Baoshan knows her too well, even after all this time, and her expression hardens. \u201cThings are coming to a head, I\u2019m afraid. It seems as if the Wen sect leader is as foolish as I was, but not nearly as clever. I have to stop it. I want your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d Baoshan says instantly. Lan Yi blinks, and Baoshan pinches her side. \u201cDid you think I would deny you? When have I ever managed that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Lan Yi says, unsheathing her own sword and stepping onto it. She holds her hand out to Baoshan, who summons her own sword back into her scabbard with a twitch of her hand before stepping onto Lan Yi\u2019s sword and wrapping her arms around her waist, pressing her body against Lan Yi\u2019s back. They could fly side by side easily, but they\u2019ve been apart for so long. There\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t have this right now. \u201cI\u2019ll explain on the way. If we don\u2019t hurry, Wuxian is going to have to handle a spot of trouble on his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat boy,\u201d Baoshan sighs, her breath warm on the back of her neck.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi laughs as they rise into the air and begins to tell Baoshan exactly what their boy has been done these past few months.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi had been talking about battle songs, ones that worked with the barrier to turn the Lan\u2019s defense into an offense. Which is all well and good when they\u2019re on one side of the barrier and their enemies are on the other, but he\u2019s pretty sure that they\u2019re not going to get that lucky.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows what he has to do. The specifics of how he\u2019s going to manage it, however, are a little cloudy at the moment. This is a trend he\u2019d like to stop repeating.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, jade tokens given to outsiders are collected upon their death. It happens rarely enough that it\u2019s actually fairly easy to keep track of that sort of thing. It\u2019s far easier, of course, to just tell the border guards that someone is allowed past the gates rather than giving them a key, and as such jade tokens were rarely distributed outside of the clan.</p>\n<p>The problem is it\u2019s been several hundred years. The problem is that not everyone dies at home and not every corpse makes it\u2019s way back. The problems is the Lan haven\u2019t bothered to change their warding structure since their inception and anyone who wants to get past them has had all the time in the world to figure out how to do it.</p>\n<p>The problem, Wei Wuxian thinks irritably to himself, is that the wards had already been in place by the time Aunt Yi was born and she had no reason to go poking around them before she exiled herself to her cave, which means if he\u2019s going to figure out how to mess with them, he\u2019s going to have to go back to the original records.</p>\n<p>If he can find them. It would be very un-Lan like to not keep that sort of information handy, but he\u2019s wondered sometimes if the reason the Lans haven\u2019t updated their wards is because they literally can\u2019t.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is acting suspiciously.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <em>always</em> acting suspiciously, as far as Lan Wangji is concerned, but recently his behavior has been more odd than usual. Everything about him makes no sense and is probably a lie and he\u2019s just running around Cloud Recesses even though he\u2019s not who he says he is.</p>\n<p>Uncle had said that he looks like Wei Changze. Uncle is skeptical of almost every other aspect of Wei Ying\u2019s story except his parentage. That part is probably true. He hopes it\u2019s true, and Wei Ying\u2019s name is his own.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is a deceiving liar. But he\u2019s a very good one. Most days he almost seems like exactly what he claims he is. He and the Jiang truly seem as if they\u2019re all old friends. He has a better relationship with all the other clans\u2019 disciples than possibly anyone else in Cloud Recesses. He even gets along with some of the Wen.</p>\n<p>He acts like a first disciple and is clearly strong enough to hold the position, even considering his age. He\u2019s bored in class, as anyone of his rank and intelligence would be, but he mostly spends it making talismans or trading notes with Nie Huaisang. He laughs and causes trouble and is friends with nearly everyone and sometimes it\u2019s almost possible to forget the way he\u2019d easily adopted the moves of each clan, almost possible to ignore the deep well of power that is his golden core.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s been acting differently lately. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p>He falls in to step with Wei Ying as he walks the path along the perimeter of the grounds, something he\u2019s never done before but has now been doing every morning as soon as the first morning bell rings. It\u2019s barely light enough to see by.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying doesn\u2019t even like mornings. He\u2019s said so, loudly, several times during the first lesson of the day. Yet here he is, waking up even earlier to take a walk that he\u2019s never taken before.</p>\n<p>If it was anyone else, they would startle at his sudden presence, but Wei Ying isn\u2019t anyone else. He knew he was going to be there before he arrived, somehow. Xichen can do that too, but he hasn\u2019t quite managed it yet. \u201cHi Lan Zhan. You\u2019re up early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always awake at this time,\u201d he answers, then says nothing, waiting to see if Wei Ying will explain his current activities on his own without prompting. He doesn\u2019t, so Lan Wangji continues, \u201cYou are usually not awake at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like to sleep in,\u201d he answers.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries not to be too interested in that, tries not to hoard every piece of information he can about Wei Ying. That\u2019s probably another true thing. He doesn\u2019t know he would bother to lie about that. \u201cThen why are awake now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you watch the sunrise?\u201d Wei Ying asks instead of answering him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not,\u201d he says, intending to steer the conversation back to Wei Ying and why he\u2019s doing something differently.</p>\n<p>Instead Wei Ying stops walking and focuses his full attention on him. Lan Wangji thinks he might enjoy that in other circumstances, but Wei Ying is frowning. \u201cReally? You get up this early every day and you don\u2019t even watch the sunrise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had very much not been prepared for this turn in the conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s the same every morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He scoffs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the last sip of wine taste the same as the first? Of course it does! That doesn\u2019t make it any less delicious!\u201d Wei Ying grabs his wrist and yanks him off the path. Lan Wangji stumbles after him because it\u2019s not like he wants Wei Ying to let him go. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s find a good vantage point. We\u2019ll watch it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything, too worried about what might come out if he starts talking, but in the end he concedes that Wei Ying might have a point.</p>\n<p>He thinks could watch the warm golden light shifting across Wei Ying\u2019s face every single day and never grow tired of it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>This whole mess started in the first place because the best idea Wei Wuxian could come up with when he got caught sneaking around Cloud Recesses was to claim to be part of the Jiang in spite of not knowing a single one of them, so Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t know why he expected a halfway decent plan out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust <em>keep a look out</em>?\u201d he demands incredulously. A-jie\u2019s lips are turned down into a frown and Nie Huaisang is peeking over the edge of his fan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we need to break in,\u201d Wei Wuxian huffs. \u201cI just need to not get caught.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng crosses his arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get caught, and we\u2019re doing this in the middle of the day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian mirrors his position. Jiang Cheng can tell he\u2019s mocking him, but he ignores it. \u201cStudents breaking into the library after curfew is very suspicious. Students in the library during normal library operating hours is not suspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it is us,\u201d Nie Huaisang says, fanning himself. \u201cThat makes it a little suspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>All of them grimace, but it\u2019s true. They\u2019re either clan heirs or \u2013 whatever Wei Wuxian is. They rarely need to go to the library to look anything up. Wei Wuxian is the only one of them who goes, and it\u2019s not to study for class.</p>\n<p>Privately, Jiang Cheng thinks the reason Wei Wuxian lounges around the library reading books that have nothing to do with what they\u2019re learning is so Lan Wangji will tower over him and lecture him about all the rules he\u2019s breaking. But that thought kind of hurts his brain, so he does his best not to dwell on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe entrance to the forbidden library is in the normal library,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues. \u201cWe\u2019ll go when it\u2019s busiest, so no one will notice be disappearing and reappearing. And if it does look like someone\u2019s getting suspicious, or heading the forbidden library themselves, you just have to warn me and then stall them for long enough for me to make my way back up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng throws up his arms and Nie Huaisang raises his fan to cover his face again, probably because he\u2019s hiding an eyeroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we supposed to do that, exactly?\u201d A-jie asks, reaching out to pat his shoulder while staring intently at Wei Wuxian. She misses and ends up just kind of hitting his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust send a paperman,\u201d he says dismissively.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng groans. The fact that Wei Wuxian just looks confused makes it even worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of us can\u2019t move a portion of consciousness into paper,\u201d Nie Huaisang says dryly. \u201cDo you have another idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>He frowns. \u201cReally? I can teach you. It\u2019s not hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not,\u201d he insists, and his look turns contemplative as he looks at A-jie. \u201cActually, Yanli-jie, this should be very doable for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. If it were anyone else, Jiang Cheng would say he was mocking her, except that this is Wei Wuxian and he would never do that.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt should?\u201d she asks nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time to practice,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, only a little gleefully.</p>\n<p>Despair flashes across Nie Huaisang\u2019s face and Jiang Cheng turns away to hide his smirk. He\u2019s actually a fair hand at talismans, but he hates demonstrating that, just in case people start asking him to do it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wen Qing shouldn\u2019t trust them. Experience has taught her not to trust anyone.</p>\n<p>But Lan Yi had held her shoulders and looked at her, an impossible person who shouldn\u2019t exist, and promised her an impossible thing. If anyone could save them, could save her family from the trap her uncle has set for them, then an immortal who\u2019s been hiding the Yin Iron for centuries must be among them.</p>\n<p>But Jiang Yanli had reached for her, putting her frail body in between her and the horribly painful waves of energy. She looped the ribbon around her, pulled her close, and tried to keep her safe even when she didn\u2019t have to, even though she doesn\u2019t even know her, even though the Jiang have all been rightfully wary of the Wen from the beginning.</p>\n<p>But Wei Wuxian had wiped the blood from her face and hadn\u2019t gotten mad at her for forcing her way into the secret he\u2019s been keeping, in going after the person he\u2019s been trying to protect all this time. Lan Yi could kill her easily, but she won\u2019t, and just Wen Qing knowing she exists but the woman Wei Wuxian calls his aunt in danger. He should be furious with her. He should hate her. Instead, he\u2019s promised to help her, instead he got Lan Yi to promise the same.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing has learned the hard way that the only person she can rely on is herself.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s learned the hard way that all on her own, she\u2019s not enough to stop the terrible things that are happening to her family, that may soon be happening to the rest of cultivation world. She shouldn\u2019t trust them, but she needs to trust them.</p>\n<p>She <em>wants</em> to trust them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t get caught doing this, because then the Lans will all freak out and either kick him out or lock him up, and neither are acceptable, because then he won\u2019t be able to protect them.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, if they kick him out then he probably still could, but it\u2019s not like he can guarantee that outcome, so it\u2019s best if he manages to do this unnoticed.</p>\n<p>They go the library in the hour before lunch and he has three papermen in his pocket, the same ones they practiced with and just waiting to be activated. Jiang Yanli and Nie Huaisang appear perfectly serene and normal about everything, but Jiang Cheng is a little twitchy. Luckily, Jiang Cheng is a little twitchy a lot, so hopefully no one will think anything of it. Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang briefly stand shoulder to shoulder to give him the cover to duck between two bookshelves that don\u2019t look like they have enough room for him to pass between them, but absolutely do as long as he steps perfectly.</p>\n<p>He wonders if Aunt Yi designed this or if she just took inspiration from it for the entrance to her cave. If he has enough time down here, he can probably look it up.</p>\n<p>The stairs are steep and he takes them two at a time until he arrives at a nondescript door. If he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think it just led to the cellar. But he does know better, so he runs his fingers over the door, trusting his touch more than his eyes in the dimly lit stairwell. His fingers catch on an unusual groove, and he takes out the forehead ribbon Aunt Yi gave him when he was twelve. He presses the cloud pattern into the groove, feeling it click into place. He almost summons his own guqin, but figures using one that the wards recognize couldn\u2019t hurt, and uses Aunt Yi\u2019s instead. He plays out a very specific tune, watching the door just in case he messes up and sets the wards off, but that doesn\u2019t happen. Instead there\u2019s the feeling of another click like when he set his forehead ribbon into the door, even though it\u2019s just solid wood, and then it swings open several inches.</p>\n<p>He ducks inside, scanning the stacks of the books. Aunt Yi had described how it was organized the last time she was there. He\u2019d been almost worried that it would have changed and he wouldn\u2019t be able to find something, or that the lock to the library itself had changed and he wouldn\u2019t be able to get in at all, but of course he should have known better. Lans hate change. It\u2019s too bad that Aunt Yi hadn\u2019t been able to act as clan leader for longer. Maybe the whole lot of them would be a whole lot less stuffy with Aunt Yi and Aunt Baoshan running around causing problems for a century or so.</p>\n<p>Well, historically speaking, it would be Aunt Yi running around causing problems and Aunt Baoshan doing her best to pull her out of whatever mess she\u2019d made, but all the better.</p>\n<p>He notes where the battle song books are, which is what Aunt Yi really wanted him to look at, but he goes even further back to where their wards are documented.</p>\n<p>Being able to defend Cloud Recesses if it\u2019s attacked is good. Stopping it from getting attacked in the first place is better.</p>\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t have surprised him if they didn\u2019t have anything on their creation, considering how long ago it was, but luckily the famous Lan meticulousness is apparently an inherited trait. He lets himself have a moment to be irritated that the Lans have all the information they needed to update the wards and have chosen not to, then starts pulling down books that look as old as Aunt Baoshan. He holds them carefully, in case the books disintegrate in his hands, but then he notices the preservation talisman inked along their spines and instead starts flipping through quickly, looking for exactly what he needs and not letting himself get distracted by all the other interesting bits.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t undo or replace the wards without the Lans noticing.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019ll have to do something else.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian reads as quickly as he can, copying down exact placements and symbols that he can\u2019t afford to forget. He wants to read more, to make sure there\u2019s nothing that he\u2019s missing, but he has two goals here. He carefully puts the ancient tomes back on the shelf, then reaches for the battle songs. They\u2019ve been used much more recently and several of them have even been copied from previous versions. They\u2019re kept apart from the regular book not only because of their subject matter, but the risk they pose to the people who perform them.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not worried. Aunt Yi taught him her Chord Assassination technique. If he can manage that without hurting himself, then these won\u2019t pose much of a problem. Hopefully.</p>\n<p>There are dozens of songs to choose from, and Wei Wuxian is halfway through a fourth likely prospect when Jiang Yanli\u2019s paperman jumps from his pocket and starts frantically grabbing at his hand, giving him an impressive papercut in the process.</p>\n<p>Three songs will have to be good enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hurrying, no need to get violent,\u201d he mutters as Jiang Yanli\u2019s paperman starts stomping the top of his hand. He folds his notes and tucks them into the sleeve of his robe before putting the book back and hurrying up the stairs. The wards reset as soon as he closes the door behind him, so he doesn\u2019t worry about that.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is waiting for him at the entrance, his back to the crevice between bookshelves that he needs to squeeze his way through. Wei Wuxian pokes the back of Jiang Cheng\u2019s neck, just in case he\u2019s trying to prevent him from slipping out under unfriendly eyes, but instead he just reaches back and yanks Wei Wuxian into the library.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still blinking to adjust his eyes to the sudden brightness when Lan Xichen turns the corner, Meng Yao at his side.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s not an expert or anything, but at some point he thinks the Lan heir fooling around with \u2013 whatever Meng Yao is will cause some problems. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think that he\u2019s part of the Nie family, but Nie Huaisang certainly acts like he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Lan Xichen, Meng Yao!\u201d he says cheerfully. Jiang Cheng looks as if he\u2019s about to pass out, and Wei Wuxian wraps an arm around his shoulders just in case.</p>\n<p>They both pause in their conversation to look in his direction. Possibly he should have moved from standing directly in front of the secret entrance to the secret library that he\u2019s not supposed to know about, but it\u2019s too late for that now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian, Jiang Wanyin,\u201d Lan Xichen says politely, his eyes briefly flickering to the space behind them that Wei Wuxian had just come through. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you taking advantage of the facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s so unfair, he\u2019s here all the time! Not reading anything for class, of course, but still. \u201cWe\u2019re hiding from your uncle,\u201d he says confidently.</p>\n<p>He hopes that Jiang Yanli is outside or something instead of just sitting in a different part of the library. Her hiding from Lan Qiren isn\u2019t very believable. Well, it is to him, because he saw her lie to his face, but other people outside the Jiang and Nie Huaisang don\u2019t know how cool she is.</p>\n<p>Meng Yao\u2019s mouth briefly twitches into something that\u2019s almost a smile. Lan Xichen blinks. \u201cAh, yes. Well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get going,\u201d he says, dragging Jiang Cheng behind him. He manages a weak wave before Wei Wuxian yanks him around the corner.</p>\n<p>All in all, a very successful endeavor. No one passed out or was banished or locked up!</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Song Lan asks, suddenly standing right at his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen raises his hand for the messenger butterfly to land on. It flutters its wings at him before unfolding into a note. He lifts it up so they can both read at once.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time a clan had requested their assistance.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time the request has come from a clan heir rather than the clan head or first disciple, or even an elder.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been bid to clan land proper rather than being asked to address an issue at a border town. Especially considering the requesting clan heir isn\u2019t even asking them to come to her own clan\u2019s land, but another\u2019s.</p>\n<p>All that, and it doesn\u2019t even say <em>why</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could be a trap,\u201d Song Lan says.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen doesn\u2019t turn to look at him only because he already knows what his face will look like. \u201cThis is a Jin butterfly. We\u2019ve gotten them before.\u201d He tilts the paper to see the characters lightly pressed into the corner. \u201cJin Zixuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another clan heir.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Yanli is sending you a message through Jin Zixuan?\u201d Song Lan asks skeptically.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are engaged,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot happily. Their mothers arranged it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan is the one who keeps up with that sort of thing. He\u2019d been so young when Shijie brought him up the mountain that he was entirely out of gossip with keeping up with clan affairs and had never managed to quite get back into it once he came back down.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when everything is a little too bewildering, he thinks of Ying-di. His younger brother would love all of it and probably pick it up a lot faster than he has.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not a thought that does him any good, so he pushes it aside. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ignore a request from Jin and Jiang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s to go to Cloud Recesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s Lan territory, and so tightly guarded we won\u2019t be able to get in anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Caiyi town,\u201d Xiao Xingchen decides. It\u2019s only a couple days out of their way. \u201cThen we will send a message to Lady Jiang. If it\u2019s truly important, she can meet us there, and we\u2019ll discover what all this is about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan sighs, but gives a grudging nod. Xiao Xingchen slips the note into his sleeve, trying not to overthink the strange message.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is that\u2019s waiting for them, they\u2019ll just have to go and meet it.</p>\n<p>This is only a temporary solution to a long term problem, but as long as Cloud Recesses is still standing when things settle, Wei Wuxian can make that someone else\u2019s problem. Realistically Aunt Yi\u2019s.</p>\n<p>He has his own jade token, the one given to Aunt Baoshan so many years ago, which means unlike the rest of the guest disciples, he doesn\u2019t have to use the main entrance. Unfortunately, if he gets caught by any of the patrols, it\u2019ll be immediately obvious that he has access to a jade token that he shouldn\u2019t. With his luck, they\u2019ll have kept records of that sort of thing, and they\u2019ll even be able to tell it\u2019s Baoshan Sanren\u2019s, which means he\u2019ll have to come clean about most of his secrets all at once.</p>\n<p>He really doesn\u2019t want to do that.</p>\n<p>But needs must, which is why he\u2019s sneaking around just outside the border of the Lan wards, laying down his own far enough outside of it that it should give him enough lead time to do something useful. He\u2019s only betting the safety of everyone in Cloud Recesses on him being fast enough.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs as he buries another hair stick into the ground.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s good, but he\u2019s not good enough to set up something this complicated without using some sort of anchor. The varied types of metals are a little trickier to work around, but it\u2019s better than doing it with just ink and paper.</p>\n<p>Hopefully no one thinks it\u2019s strange that the Jiang and Nie disciples are all suddenly using hair ribbons.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>No matter how the pure moral center of the clan has been corroded, Wen Mao\u2019s descendants are not unskilled.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren flings her sword forward, her cultivation energy sharpening around the blade and beheading three cultivators before it returns to her hand. Lan Yi bows at an oncoming wave of Wen before rising and pressing her hands forward, pushing forward a shimmering wall of energy that strips the skin from her bones.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi had gotten inventive in that cave.</p>\n<p>Maybe against only one of them, the Wen would be successful. But against two immortals? Against her and Lan Yi fighting together?</p>\n<p>Hopefully they\u2019ll start surrendering soon. The Dafan Wen will take over as the main branch of the Wen, but it would be better if the girl Lan Yi had told her about didn\u2019t have to start from scratch.</p>\n<p>If this ends soon, maybe they can catch up to the Wen army that had left before they\u2019d arrived and save their kid some trouble.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only a small fraction of the Wen. It\u2019s more important for her and Lan Yi to be here. If they leave, then Wen Qing\u2019s people will be in danger. If she allows Wen Qing\u2019s people to be endanger, she\u2019ll make a liar out of Lan Yi and Wuxian both, which she\u2019s unwilling to do.</p>\n<p>But that means that Cloud Recesses will have to defend itself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Even though they\u2019d traveled to Caiyi city at her request, Xiao Xingchen is still surprised to see Jiang Yanli making her way towards their table, wearing her clan robes rather than those of a guest disciple.</p>\n<p>They get to their feet to bow to her and she inclines her head in return. She takes a seat and says, \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour clan has always been courteous to us, Lady Jiang,\u201d Song Lan says politely. \u201cI have to admit at surprised at the specifics of your missive, as well as your appearance here today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen doesn\u2019t understand what Song Lan is getting at, but Jiang Yanli does. Her lips pull back in amusement. \u201cI am the eldest child and second heir of the Jiang. It would be unreasonable for Clan Leader Lan to refuse my reasonable request for an afternoon excursion to run a personal errand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, right, the guest disciples aren\u2019t supposed to leave Cloud Recesses unaccompanied. He hadn\u2019t thought of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Song Lan says. \u201cLady Jiang. What is it exactly that you\u2019d like our assistance with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her amusement fades and she presses her hands flat against the table in front of her to keep herself from fidgeting. Xiao Xingchen recognizes the gesture because it\u2019s the same one he used to make after he first descended the mountain. \u201cI hope nothing. I hope that I have imposed upon your good nature without reason. But I fear for the safety of all who reside in Cloud Recesses and even the city we\u2019re in now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He and Song Lan sit up straighter. Her tone is low and serious and in spite of her age, he doesn\u2019t doubt her. He\u2019s heard the rumors about her, mostly from Song Lan, but now that he\u2019s sitting in front of her, he doesn\u2019t think that any of them can be accurate. Jiang Yanli is not a woman who invites doubt.</p>\n<p>But instead of explaining, she lays a purse heavy with silver in front of them. \u201cI wish I could tell you more, but I cannot. If what I fear does not come to pass, then I will have betrayed someone who\u2019s very important to me for nothing. I can\u2019t risk that. I request that you stay in the city. I will cover your expenses. All I ask is that if there is trouble, you assist us.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve done more for less, and it\u2019s not as if a few more days of their time is worth alienating the second Jiang heir and fiance to the Jin heir.</p>\n<p>More than any of that, he believes her. If she offered nothing at all, he\u2019d insist they stay anyway, until whatever danger she fears either comes to fruition or passes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow will we know if there\u2019s trouble?\u201d Song Lan asks.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s smiling again, but it\u2019s more rueful than amused. \u201cUnfortunately, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. You\u2019ll know. It will be impossible to miss.\u201d She bows to them, lower than is proper. \u201cPlease, grant me this favor. I will be indebted to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Xiao Xingchen says, grabbing her forearms and pushing her upright. \u201cIt would be our pleasure to provide you aid. Do not trouble yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles at him, sweet and sincere and so relieved that her age shines through her competence. She\u2019s young and she\u2019s scared and she wants their help. There\u2019s no question about what the right thing to do is.</p>\n<p>After she\u2019s gone, Song Lan weighs the purse in his hand and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get involved in the clans. You think they\u2019re greedy and unfocused and arrogant.\u201d</p>\n<p>All of this is true. He was raised by Baoshan Sanren. She did not dislike the clans, exactly, but he\u2019d been taught to be a certain type of cultivator and it chafed at him that the clan cultivators were not raised to be the same, that they\u2019re focused on status and wealth and not the ills of the land they were meant to protect.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like them a lot more if Lady Jiang and her ilk were in charge of them,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Although, it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s just biased.</p>\n<p>Something about her determination reminds him of Ying-di. He thinks his brother would like her, if they ever got the chance to meet.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Lan Wangji\u2019s turn on the patrol roster, which is how he finds Wei Ying stretched out on a rock near the cold springs, his hands behind his head. At least he doesn\u2019t appear to have any alcohol. \u201cYou are breaking curfew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Lan Zhan,\u201d he says absently, not looking at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at the sunrise. Do you at least watch the stars?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying keeps saying things to him that no one ever has before. It makes him feel off balance, like when he was a little kid and Xichen would spin him around until he fell over. \u201cThey do not need watching. They do not move.\u201d Wei Ying opens his mouth and he quickly amends, \u201cThey do not move often.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unlike Wei Ying. He\u2019s constantly moving and in need of constant supervision. Maybe if he watches closely enough, something about him will start making sense.</p>\n<p>He pats the space next to him. \u201cTake a seat. They deserve a good look. What if one disappears and you never notice because you were too busy to get a proper look at them in the first place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is sure that\u2019s already happened and he can\u2019t bring himself to consider it any sort of tragedy. \u201cI\u2019m on patrol.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly time to switch the shifts anyway,\u201d Wei Ying says. How does he know that? \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hesitates. He really shouldn\u2019t. He should go back to his room and get as close to a proper night\u2019s rest that he can. He should escort Wei Ying back to his dorm and issue punishments in the morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you worried about your hair?\u201d He extends one arm out. \u201cHere. Now it won\u2019t get messed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surely he can only be expected to endure so much.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s disgraceful. Dishonorable. Inappropriate, unnecessary, and beneath him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slowly lowers himself and then leans back until his head hits Wei Ying\u2019s forearm. Considering how tense the rest of his body is, it\u2019s an uncomfortable position, but he refuses to move.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love the stars,\u201d Wei Ying says and Lan Wangji forces himself to focus on the night sky. \u201cWhen I was a kid I\u2019d beg to sleep outside so I could fall asleep looking at them. I always woke up in bed after. I was such a needy kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it hard?\u201d he asks. \u201cTo grow up a rogue cultivator?\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to ask about Wei Ying\u2019s life so that he can know him better. He doesn\u2019t want to ask about Wei Ying\u2019s life because he doesn\u2019t want to be lied to.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shrugs, and Lan Wangji feels the motion more than he sees it. \u201cYes. And not really. A lot of things were difficult, if you want to look at it that way, but the important things were easy because the people around me worked hard to make them that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of that means anything to Lan Wangji, but at least it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s lying. It\u2019s more than he\u2019d been hoping for. Emboldened, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hums, and the silence stretches out, but it doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable like other silences that Lan Wangji often finds himself an unwilling participant in. The stars are bright and he can feel Wei Ying\u2019s warmth through all seven layers of his robes. Eventually Wei Ying says, \u201cIt\u2019s the same as Lan Qiren, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, turning his head to look at Wei Ying. He really hadn\u2019t been expecting him to bring up his uncle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you know, obviously I think he\u2019s too high strung and overly focused on the rules,\u201d Lan Wangji tries to muster up some sort of indignation over this, but it\u2019s difficult when Wei Ying has said as much to his uncle\u2019s face, \u201cbut this wasn\u2019t supposed to be his life, and I doubt it\u2019s what he wanted, but he\u2019s doing it anyway. Because he loves you. And your brother, and your father. So he makes it easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji would never describe anything about his uncle as <em>easy</em>.</p>\n<p>Some of that must come through from his silence, because Wei Ying lets out a soft huff of laughter and turns to look at him. Lan Wangji does the same, and tells himself it\u2019s okay because Wei Wuxian did it first. \u201cHe was the younger brother, right? Like you are. He wasn\u2019t supposed to have to be clan head.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never thought of that before. Uncle used to hold the same position he does, the brother to the future the clan head, the second heir.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he likes it,\u201d Wei Ying continues. \u201cI think it stresses him out and frustrates him. I don\u2019t think he was planning to have kids either, because he doesn\u2019t have a spouse or his own children and as an acting clan head it\u2019s not like finding someone willing would be hard, even with his personality. Even Jin Guangshan has a wife, and I\u2019d rather marry your uncle than him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Putting aside that disturbing thought, there\u2019s some obvious truth to what Wei Ying is saying. The elders had tried to pressure Uncle to get married, to have his own children, and he\u2019d refused. Xichen had said it was to protect them, to keep heirs with less divisive parentage from taking their place. Personally, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t really care if he\u2019s the second heir or the third or the eighth. He knows his brother is dedicated to serving and protecting their clan, but he doesn\u2019t think Xichen centers that identity around being the clan head specifically. If Uncle did have his own children, and they were made the first heirs over him and Xichen despite their birth, he wouldn\u2019t mind.</p>\n<p>Beyond all that, there\u2019s the obvious answer that if the council insisted that that Uncle was more than just the Acting Clan Head and forced the title on him properly, he\u2019d still be able to choose his own succession. He could name Xichen the heir over his own children regardless of what the council wanted.</p>\n<p>Which means that maybe Wei Ying is right. Maybe his uncle didn\u2019t want kids or the responsibility or any of that, but he\u2019d spent two decades forced into that role anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be upset,\u201d Wei Ying says. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t think his face is giving anything away, but it must be. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing, or a sad thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a lived hard life that he did not want because of me,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The cold night air is making his eyes sting. \u201cThat is not a cause of celebration.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sighs and reaches out to poke his forehead, dangerously close to his forehead ribbon. \u201cThe woman who raised me was terrified to lose me like she\u2019d lost the other children she helped. But she let me wander to the nearest city as a child and gave me money to buy food that I loved, even though she had rules against that sort of thing. She did something that was painful and difficult for her so I could have what I wanted. Because she loved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>This sounds like another true thing, and Lan Wangji wants to cling to that, but more than anything else he\u2019s just confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot every trial is a loss. Lan Qiren chose the hardest path for himself so that his brother and his nephews could have the easier one.\u201d Wei Ying\u2019s smile softens. \u201cI think that the hardest things we do, we do for love. Because if it wasn\u2019t for love, those hard things wouldn\u2019t be worth it. If people love us, they do not want us to feel guilty over their sacrifices, only warmed by them. And I think that your uncle loves you very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Maybe it isn\u2019t so cold after all.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wen Qing has no love for her uncle but she did learn an important lesson from him.</p>\n<p>Power cannot be given. It can only be earned. It can only be taken.</p>\n<p>If her branch of the family is to take over as the main branch, if those distant family members and servants and civilians are going to accept the rule of a different ruling branch of the family, it can\u2019t be just because a couple immortals say so. No matter the power of Lan Yi, or the infamous Baoshan Sanren, the Dafan Wen will have to make their own mark, they\u2019ll have to prove they\u2019ve earned it if they want to maintain any sort of order.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing will have to prove that she\u2019s earned it.</p>\n<p>She knows how. She may not like it, not revel in it, but she\u2019s committed to it.</p>\n<p>Too many people are risking themselves to help her and too many people are depending on her to let her squeamishness get in her way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing she brough a lot of pins.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been several days since Wei Wuxian collected every piece of jewelry his clan had, which was a much more difficult task for him than it had been for the Jiang. Nie Huaisang\u2019s disciples don\u2019t care enough about being ornamental to question him over it, but he\u2019d had to come up with an excuse for A-Yao. He doesn\u2019t think that he\u2019d totally bought his story about a little recreational gambling between clan heirs, even if the lie had been supported by the Jiang disciples\u2019 hair pieces also all going missing and Jin Zixuan being an unreadable asshole, but thankfully he\u2019s been too distracted by Lan Xichen\u2019s attention to question him over it.</p>\n<p>Frankly, Lan Xichen is lucky that Nie Huaisang currently has bigger problems, otherwise he\u2019d absolutely be giving him shit about seducing his brother\u2019s \u2013 er, whatever A-Yao is to his brother. After all this is over, he\u2019s really going to have to have several conversations with his brother about A-Yao if they don\u2019t want to lose him to the Lan.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t asked A-Yao for his hair ornament. Wei Wuxian had said that they didn\u2019t need it, and even if they had, he would have rather snuck down to Caiyi and bought a several dozen of them with his own money rather than ask for A-Yao\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang had given A-Yao that hair ornament off his own head when he was still a kid. Beyond that, it\u2019s an important reminder to Lan Xichen that A-Yao already belongs to a clan and he\u2019s not for sale.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all in class, basically none of the clan heirs or Wei Wuxian paying attention to the lecture because they already know this, and enough time has passed that he\u2019s hopeful that maybe Wei Wuxian was just being overly cautious, that whatever terrible thing he was afraid of won\u2019t actually come to pass.</p>\n<p>Which of course is when Wei Wuxian bolts upright, pulls a burning talisman from his pocket, and says, \u201cWell, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t have jinxed it.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian goes running from the classroom, Jiang Cheng and the top ranked Jiang following a step behind him. Nie Hua looks towards him and he gives her a sharp nod. They\u2019d discussed this. She leaps over the desk to go after them. Fen Zirui steps on his foot as he passes, because he thinks this whole thing is insane and he doesn\u2019t want to be involved, but he should have thought of that before being the third scariest Nie cultivator in Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pushes himself up, bows to the bewildered professor, and breaks one of the rules of Cloud Recesses by running out of the room. Damn. He doesn\u2019t think Wei Wuxian would tell Lan Wangji anything, at least not without telling the rest of them that he had, but he can\u2019t think of any other explanation. He\u2019s known Lan Wangji practically his whole life and he\u2019s not one to rush headfirst into anything. He has to know <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to do the right thing,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, \u201cthen you should go with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang blinks, surprised that any of the Jiang would have refused to follow Jiang Cheng, but she\u2019s not speaking to one of her own clan.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s speaking to Jin Zixuan.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both standing, looking at each other like they\u2019re the only ones in the room, even though Jin Zixuan is frowning and holding his sword in a white knuckled grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you-\u201d Jin Zixun starts, sneering.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan bolts from the room.</p>\n<p>His cousin stares after him, open mouthed. \u201cZixuan, what are you \u2013 Zixuan!\u201d he shouts before going after him. Mianmian looks rapidly between Jiang Yanli and the door before shrugging and chasing after them.</p>\n<p>Mianmian will be fine, hopefully, but he\u2019s a little dubious about Jin Zixun. Then again, he supposes Jin Zixuan wouldn\u2019t keep him around if he was totally useless, cousin or not.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He only has Jiang Yanli\u2019s word that getting involved is the right thing to do, and apparently that\u2019s enough for him.</p>\n<p>Maybe he does deserve her.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s distracted from the thought by the teacher demanding to know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing and Wen Ning are the only Wens that ever bother to come to classes. Wen Qing slips away while the teacher is distracted, being far more subtle about it than rest of them had been. Wen Ning follows her a few moments later. He wishes he could send some disciples after them, even if only for backup, but he understands that this is something they have to do on their own.</p>\n<p>He hates it, though.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang takes out the bottle of wine from his sleeve and starts drinking. Either way, he thinks he going to need it.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t really understand the complex talisman and ward work that Wei Wuxian had described to them, but he doesn\u2019t need to for him to know that they have a very small window to prevent this from becoming a massacre one way or another.</p>\n<p>There are the perimeter wards, little flimsy things that Wei Wuxian set up all over the mountains surrounding Cloud Recesses, and that\u2019s what caused his talisman to catch flames.</p>\n<p>Then there are much stronger, sort of terrifying wards that he set up outside the ones that the Lan have already put up, ready to be activated and work with the existing Lan wards in a way that still doesn\u2019t make any sense to him even after Wei Wuxian had explained it three times. The important part is that it makes it stronger, that jade tokens aren\u2019t enough to get through anymore.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang had suggested they all just wait inside the perimeter where it was safe, but he\u2019s barely finished the thought before they\u2019d all realized the problem with that.</p>\n<p>Caiyi.</p>\n<p>When the Wens find themselves unable to get into Cloud Recesses, they\u2019ll attack the civilians. It\u2019s their job to protect the civilians. They can\u2019t let that happen, so they have to get involved, they have to protect Cloud Recesses and keep the Wen focused and fighting in the mountains and not give them the chance to burn and destroy the city below.</p>\n<p>To do that, they have to get outside of the protection of the wards before the Wens cross over them. They have to lock themselves out to keep the Lans locked in.</p>\n<p>With the Wen disciples.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the lesser of two evils, but it still makes him nervous.</p>\n<p>They cross out of the front gate and Wei Wuxian leads them further down the mountain. It\u2019s then that Jiang Cheng notices that there are more people here, not just the Jiang and the Nie, but several Jin and even Lan Wangji for some reason.</p>\n<p>Hopefully they\u2019ll end up getting stabbed instead of his own people.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t look at him, instead drawing a complicated talisman in the air with crackling red cultivation energy. \u201cAn army is coming for Cloud Recesses. If you get behind the gate, you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lang Wangji doesn\u2019t waste any time disbelieving him. As many lies as Wei Ying tells, he would not lie about this. Instead he unsheathes his sword. The grin Wei Ying sends him is enough to make it worth it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really more a battalion,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What army?\u201d Jin Zixun demands. \u201cOr battalion, or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shoves the most complicated talisman he\u2019s ever seen forward, the motion using his whole body.</p>\n<p>The talisman hits the Lan wards and shatters against it like a firework. Every place a spark touches lights up and strings of blue light intersect with red, wrapping together and expanding. It takes him several seconds to realize that the red is coming from several feet away from where he knows the edge of the wards is.</p>\n<p>The same reaction is happening as far as he can see and expanding far above that, until every bit of Cloud Recesses he can see is encased in a glittering dome of faint blue and bright red strings of cultivation energy.</p>\n<p>Luo Qingyang whistles. \u201cDamn. Just one of the things you pick up from being a rogue cultivator, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Wei Ying says, entirely without bite. \u201cWe have about twenty seconds until a couple hundred really pissed off cultivators are on top of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know they\u2019ll head here anyway? Jiang Cheng asks. \u201cThey could enter Cloud Recesses from any direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes his head. \u201cNot easily. Even if they\u2019re using a way that doesn\u2019t need the entrance specifically, this is the weakest point of the wards. It\u2019s their best shot. They\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wants to say that no one would be able to get through the wards, but considering what he\u2019s just seen Wei Ying do, he\u2019s a lot less confident in that assessment.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouple <em>hundred</em>?\u201d Jin Zixuan repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Wei Ying says and then sticks his sheathed sword in his belt for some insane reason. He passes his hand in front of himself in a move Lan Wangji is so familiar with and yet one that Wei Ying can\u2019t possibly be making. Except he is, and a guqin appears underneath his hands. Not just any guqin, but one obviously Lan in design, and one radiating so much power that it has to be the spiritual tool of a very old and powerful Lan. It has to be, and yet it can\u2019t be, because Lan Wangji knows all the Lans, obviously, and none of them have the same energy as that guqin. \u201cYou just have to take care of the ones that get by me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fen Zirui rolls his eyes, his saber balanced on his shoulder. \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very impressive and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re all taking that seriously,\u201d Wei Ying complains. \u201cThese were meant take down <em>real</em> armies. It should be able to handle the Wen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould,\u201d one of the Jiang disciples repeats, but she\u2019s grinning.</p>\n<p>He reaches out, hesitates for a moment, then grabs onto Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but Wei Ying looks him in the eyes and smiles. He nods towards his sword. \u201cYour guqin would probably serve you better. Do you know any battle songs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChord assassination,\u201d he answers.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shouldn\u2019t even know what that is, but Lan Wangji is unsurprised when he lights up and says, \u201cReally? Are you any good?\u201d He raises an eyebrow and Wei Ying claps him on the back. \u201cOf course you are, of course you are, what a silly question. This is great! Maybe we won\u2019t need backup after all!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBackup for <em>what</em>? Jin Zixun spits.</p>\n<p>He gets his answer when the sky turns red with Wen cultivators.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen is stuck inside of Cloud Recesses under a strange sort of glowing net that would be impressive if he had the room to feel anything but horrified. What they\u2019d feared has come to pass. The Wens are making a move against them, but there\u2019s something worse than the Wen he can see surrounding Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>Wangji isn\u2019t here. Lan Xichen doesn\u2019t know where his brother is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Uncle shouts.</p>\n<p>Everyone is gathered outside, staring up at the strange wards. Which of course means they see the exact moment that a flood of Wen cultivators fly over and drop flaming talismans over them.</p>\n<p>They also all see the flaming talismans hit the strange net and disintegrate on contact.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not panic,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, pitching her voice so it cuts through the shouts and confusion. \u201cWe are safe in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shifts towards her, noting A-Yao\u2019s glare directed at Huaisang and the grip he has on the collar of Huaisang\u2019s robe without truly processing it. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Wen have planned an attack, but don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s being handled,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s so clear that she\u2019s speaking to all the frantic disciples surrounding them and the anxious servants and the parents clutching their children rather than just him.</p>\n<p>Xichen knows this. He sees it. But he can\u2019t accept it. \u201cMy brother is out there!\u201d he snaps, closing the distance between them to tower over her. He knows it\u2019s a cheap shot, considering the difference in their height, but he\u2019s terrified.</p>\n<p>Instead of wilting, Jiang Yanli tilts her head back to look him in the eye. Like this, she almost reminds him of her mother. \u201cSo are <em>mine</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Her fury more than the truth of the matter is what throws him off balance, even though of course she\u2019s right. Jiang Cheng is out there. Wei Wuxian had been the first to go running. Others had followed. There are more Jiang disciples out there than anyone else, and second heir or not, Jiang Yanli is the eldest, her brother respects her. They\u2019re out there with her blessing, with her orders.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what tempers him. Jiang Yanli would not put her own people in danger without cause.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can explain.\u201d</p>\n<p>They turn. At first he thinks that Wen Qing has changed into her clan\u2019s robes, but a second later he realizes that\u2019s incorrect. She\u2019s still wearing the traditional white robes of a guest disciple.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s that she\u2019s covered in blood.</p>\n<p>Several people raise their swords in her direction. None of them are Nie or Jiang.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d forgotten about the Wen guest disciples. He hadn\u2019t seen them and assumed they\u2019d snuck outside but what if they\u2019re sabotaging them from the inside, hiding out and waiting to do something terrible \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cLower your swords!\u201d Jiang Yanli shouts, pushing herself forward to put herself in front of Wen Qing. Every Jiang reaches for their swords then, making it clear what they\u2019ll do if anyone tries to get to Wen Qing by going through their senior sister. \u201cShe\u2019s not our enemy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Qing steps forward and puts her hand on Jiang Yanli\u2019s shoulder, leaving behind a bloody handprint. More interestingly, none of the Jiang react. They must really believe that Wen Qing isn\u2019t a threat.</p>\n<p>At least to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d Uncle demands. \u201cWhere are the rest of your clan? How have you trapped us here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Ning is finishing clean up,\u201d she says. Her hands are trembling. Lan Xichen has barely had the time to notice before she\u2019s placing them behind her back and lifting her chin. \u201cEveryone else is dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang whistles. A-Yao grabs Nie Huaisang\u2019s fan out of his belt and hits him with it, the most disrespectful Lan Xichen has ever seen A-Yao be in public. If things were any less dire, it would make him smile.</p>\n<p>Uncle marches to the front of them, his hand on his sword and his eyes narrowed. \u201cExplain yourself, Lady Wen.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s speaking to her respectfully. That does surprise him. Whatever\u2019s happening, Uncle must at least have an idea about it, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be so calm.</p>\n<p>She inclines her head, shallower than he thinks is appropriate but then again he doesn\u2019t have the full context for what\u2019s happening.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know where his brother is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe came here to steal the Yin Iron from you,\u201d she says. There\u2019s muttering from the elders, but Uncle doesn\u2019t react. He\u2019s not surprised. \u201cMy uncle wants all the pieces for himself so he can force the other clans to submit to his will. It\u2019s not enough for him to be the Chief Cultivator. He wants more power.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tumble of voices shouting insults and demanding explanations. Uncle allows it for a moment before raising his hand. They all fall silent.\u00a0 \u201cAnd you\u2019ve killed not only his disciples, but his son?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Chao. He hadn\u2019t thought about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe killed my father,\u201d she says. There\u2019s shouting in the distance and the strange glowing cage of red cultivation energy surrounding them shakes but does not break. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is because he\u2019s holding the Dafan Wen hostage. The only reason I\u2019m here is because my little brother\u2019s safety hinged on my cooperation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Ruohan will kill your people in retaliation for your betrayal,\u201d Uncle says. \u201cYou understand that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Qing does the last thing Lan Xichen expects her to do.</p>\n<p>She smiles.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan can\u2019t make sense of Wei Wuxian and unlike seemingly everyone else, he hasn\u2019t bothered to try.</p>\n<p>If the Jiang want to claim a random rogue cultivator is their first disciple, that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with him. If Jiang Yanli wants to be stiff and quiet and so polite it burns around him, and then wants to smile and laugh with this random cultivator, wants to let him put his arms around her and tug on her hair and call her sister, then \u2013 then that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with him either.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian and all the dirty and disapproving glances he sends his way simply aren\u2019t worth thinking about.</p>\n<p>Now, standing at Wei Wuxian\u2019s back as more Wen than he\u2019s ever seen in one place come rushing towards them, he thinks that maybe that was a mistake.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re going to die. They\u2019re going to die so quickly, crushed under the number of people without the need for anyone to even raise a sword \u2013</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian finishes plucking out some sharp, seemingly off key notes on his guqin and a wave of energy so powerful it makes the air shimmer rushes out in front of him. It hits the Wen and the first line of them fall to the ground, their skin blackened and burned, while those nearest to them catch flames to varying degrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cGross,\u201d Nie Hua says. His cousin doesn\u2019t say anything, but his face makes it clear that he agrees. Qingyang just looks impressed. She\u2019s so much tougher than anyone ever gives her credit for.</p>\n<p>The Wen are scrambling to put out their clan members, momentarily distracted from their mission of killing them. Wei Wuxian has already started playing again. A couple Wen rush forward, but Lan Wangji does something on his guqin that doesn\u2019t seem to require the same amount of build up. It seems to kill one of the Wen where she stands and sends the others staggering backwards.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng steps forward to poke Wei Wuxian in the back with the hilt of his sword and hisses, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers absently, looking down at the strings as he plays rather than the oncoming Wen. It seems stupid until Jin Zixuan realizes he\u2019s counting on the rest of them to protect him while he plays. He raises his sword a little higher. \u201cOr not only me. <em>I</em> couldn\u2019t do that. I guess Aunt Yi wanted me to use hers for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t make any sense to him, but Jiang Cheng nods like it explains something. Then Wen are running over the smoking bodies to get at them and Jin Zixuan experiences the worst two minutes of his life fighting cultivators that are older and more experienced than him but luckily not stronger until Wei Wuxian shouts and they\u2019re running for the safety of his back as he lets out another devastating wave of energy. He doesn\u2019t know what this one does, but it causes nearly two dozen seemingly unharmed Wen to fall dead on the spot. It\u2019s less gory but significantly more disturbing.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan can\u2019t make sense of it, but it means that they actually stand a chance against the crush of cultivators trying to kill them, so he decides that it\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>In a fair fight, his sister loses.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning supposes it\u2019s a good thing that Qing-jie doesn\u2019t fight fair.</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t wanted him to come with her. She\u2019d wanted him to stay in the classroom, safe and where he couldn\u2019t be blamed for what she was about to do.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even known what exactly she\u2019d been planning. He\u2019d only known that he hadn\u2019t wanted her to do it alone.</p>\n<p>Qing-jie wouldn\u2019t put their family in danger \u2013 their real family, not the cousins and uncle who have been so cruel, who had taken their father away. He believes that the same way he believes that the sun will rise each morning, less faith and more a fact, something that just is. So he doesn\u2019t question her or doubt her.</p>\n<p>But now that he\u2019s going around the bodies of all their clan members and pulling out the pins that Qing-jie had spent the past week shoving into the base of their skulls while they were sleeping. All it had taken was one precises application of cultivation energy for them all to collapse, and killing them had been easy then.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not fair, or brave, or romantic.</p>\n<p>But it means that the people who had hurt them are dead and they\u2019re not.</p>\n<p>Qing-jie is so scary. He loves her.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli had been right. It\u2019s impossible not to notice.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen hears the screaming first. He grabs his sword and bolts, Song Lan right behind him. They spill out onto the street and mostly he scans it up and down, passing his eyes over the terrified people running into the nearest shop or house and trying to find what it is they\u2019re running from.</p>\n<p>Song Lan taps his shoulder and then points up. He follows the gesture only to see what looks like a couple hundred Wen flying over them. They\u2019re not descending, instead flying straight over the city.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re headed for Cloud Recess. Which holds not only the Lan, but every heir of the major sects.</p>\n<p>It seems an idiotic move. He\u2019d say that nothing could unite the other four major clans when they\u2019ve been allowing the Wen\u2019s atrocities for decades, but if anything could it would be the death of their children. It\u2019s a stupid move, and for all their other flaws, he wouldn\u2019t describe the Wen as stupid. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He and Song Lan step onto their swords, staying above the frantic people but far before the Wens. It\u2019s a relief when they\u2019re able to enter the woods. The trees provide enough cover that the Wen are unlikely to notice them, but having to dodge around them means that the Wen will arrive far before they do.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lan have wards,\u201d Song Lan says.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen says the obvious because Song Lan doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be attacking unless they had a way to get around them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan\u2019s frown deepens, but he just nods.</p>\n<p>They hear the battle before they see it, the harsh cords of a guqin reverberating through the air. When they arrive, it\u2019s to see the Wen cultivators pressed up against the entrance of Cloud Recesses. For one moment he thinks that the Lan wards have managed to hold, but the bright red cultivation energy in the distance doesn\u2019t belong to the Lan.</p>\n<p>They are here on Jiang Yanli\u2019s request. They promised their help. Regardless, helping is the right thing to do it, and they would be interfering anyway.</p>\n<p>But when he sees that familiar cultivation energy, concentrated enough that he can feel it from here, his blood runs cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cXingchen?\u201d Song Lan asks softly.</p>\n<p>He lurches forward, slicing the heads off the two nearest Wen with one move, and keeps going.</p>\n<p>Song Lan rushes to his side, gutting a Wen as he passes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He jumps up, using his golden core to suspend him in the air so he can see over the makeshift battlefield. Over a quarter of the Wen are dead, their clansmen having to climb over their bodies to try and get closer. Instead of clan elders defending Cloud Recesses, he only sees a single Lan there, the teenage Second Jade of Lan.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all teenagers. There\u2019s Jiang and Nie and even a couple Jin and not a single senior disciple.</p>\n<p>The person frantically playing the guqin while the other defend him is Ying-di.</p>\n<p>He falls back down, landing on a Wen and shoving his sword into her spine and yanking it out before she\u2019s even hit the ground. He doesn\u2019t know what his face looks like right now, but whatever it is has Song Lan the closest to frantic he\u2019s ever seen. \u201cMy brother is up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan blinks and then his face settles into determination.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen pulls him back as the next attack leaves the guqin. He does a double take, because that power isn\u2019t just Ying-di\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t have time to linger over it because then he and Song Lan are fighting their way through the throng of Wen, trying to make it to the front before the next attack forces them back.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows the power an immortal wields. He was raised by one and then two of them and he grew up with the pressure of their golden cores as a familiar weight.</p>\n<p>But as the effects of each verse of the battle song crush the Wen, he thinks that he may have mistaken familiarity for understanding.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s played Aunt Yi\u2019s guqin before. He learned on this guqin, plucked out his first clumsy chords on it with Aunt Yi\u2019s hands on his shoulders. It\u2019s almost baffling to him now, that she let him play on it when this is what it was capable of.</p>\n<p>Aunt Baoshan had buildings to put up and children to raise and train and her friends\u2019 descendants to check up on and learn from. She may have spent most of her time on the mountain, but she had plenty to do.</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi didn\u2019t have that. She lived in the cave and survived off inedia, only briefly leaving a handful of times for supplies and even then never straying outside the bounds of Cloud Recesses. All she had to fill the rest of the long years of her self-imposed exile was meditating and training.</p>\n<p>Her guqin holds several hundred years of refined power, ready to be released as soon as he plucks the right combination of strings.</p>\n<p>He wishes she would have <em>told</em> him that. He would have panicked a lot less and not stolen everyone\u2019s hair ornaments.</p>\n<p>The others swarm in front of him as he builds the song back up again, Lan Zhan dispersing Chord Assassination which does a great job of disorienting and breaking up anyone it doesn\u2019t kill. Jiang Cheng, Jin Zixuan, Mianmian, and Fen Zirui are leading the attacks in between Lan Zhan\u2019s hits with the other disciples providing back up to them.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re surrounded by dead Wen while so far none of them have gotten more than a scratch, which seems like a good sign, but they\u2019re tiring. They\u2019re all skilled, but they\u2019re young, and there are so many Wen left.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s some commotion from the back and Jin Zixuan and his cousin turn themselves toward it, swords extended and ready. Except four Wen go down at once revealing a cultivator he doesn\u2019t know and one he definitely does.</p>\n<p>\u201cXingchen-ge!\u201d he shouts out joyously, not waving only because his hands are otherwise occupied by playing. Their audience catches up with him, and he continues, \u201cEr, who I know from my time as a rogue cultivator and not for any other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Hua says, \u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d in between stabbing a cultivator twice her size and he\u2019s going to choose to believe that it\u2019s not directed at him.</p>\n<p>The Jin and Jiang part enough for Xingchen-ge and the man next to him to come forward while beating back the Wen. Lan Zhan gives a warning and then they\u2019re all falling back as he performs another Chord Assassination.</p>\n<p>Xingchen-ge rushes towards him, gripping the back of his neck and demanding, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? When did you leave the mountain and why didn\u2019t you come to find me instead of ending up <em>here</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, hopefully quietly enough that no one overhears it. \u201cI\u2019m pretending to be the first disciple of the Jiang. I\u2019ll explain later. Who\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYing-di,\u201d Xingchen-ge sighs. His grin in response is not appropriate considering their situation, but he can\u2019t help it. \u201cHis name is Song Lan. I\u2019ll introduce you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finishes another verse which takes out another wave of the Wen disciples and Xingchen-ge yanks on the end of his ponytail before joining the fight. He\u2019d been worried before, but now with Xingchen-ge and Song Lan here, it\u2019s almost embarrassing how one sided the fight becomes.</p>\n<p>An hour later, Mianmian kills the last Wen cultivator and he and Lan Zhan banish their guqins. while everyone else cleans off their swords. He gives everyone a quick once over, and aside from some cuts and what\u2019s probably going to end up being a colorful collection of bruises, they\u2019re unharmed.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is feeling really good about everything until he turns around to see what looks like the entirety of Cloud Recesses pressed against the edge of his wards, Lan Qiren front and center with his arms crossed.</p>\n<p>Obviously none of them had looked up the hill towards the Cloud Recesses during the fight. It would be foolish to turn their back on the enemy for longer than absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing is standing next to Yanli-jie, who gives him a smile and a thumbs up. It\u2019s not as encouraging as she\u2019s probably hoping it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lan Zhan says, softly enough that Wei Wuxian probably wouldn\u2019t have heard him if he wasn\u2019t standing so close. Lan Xichen isn\u2019t smiling.</p>\n<p>He throws his arm around Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders and says, \u201cI could keep the wards up until they promise not to yell at us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mianmian snorts. Lan Zhan\u2019s silence is a little too close to contemplation for his comfort, but he just shakes his head.</p>\n<p>Oh well.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in so much trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d Xichen says, gripping his shoulders, \u201care you okay? Why did you follow them? What were you thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am okay,\u201d he says, and then doesn\u2019t say anything else.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying had sounded scared and he\u2019d run so Lan Wangji had followed. What he\u2019d been thinking is that he didn\u2019t want Wei Ying to face whatever he was afraid of alone.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to say that out loud. Even to his brother.</p>\n<p>Meng Yao is reprimanding Nie Hua and Fen Zirui, gesticulating with Nie Huaisang\u2019s fan for some reason and hitting them on the arm with it several times. Meng Yao barely comes up to their shoulders and has spent the past couple of months acting like a servant, but the both of them are taking their scolding with their heads lowered and acting appropriately contrite. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re actually contrite, and Meng Yao must agree because his voice is rising to the closest to yelling he\u2019s ever heard from him.</p>\n<p>The Jiang disciples rush towards each other, looking each other over for injuries and yelling at one another in increasing volume to be heard over everyone else. There\u2019s a complete lack or propriety, the junior disciples poking and prodding at Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli respectively as if they\u2019re not clan heirs.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian escapes a similar fate by rushing past them to Wen Qing, grabbing her upper arms, and lifting her into the air.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very inappropriate for him to be jealous right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Qing! What happened to you, you\u2019re all \u2013 oh no, Wen Ning, you too?\u201d He puts down Wen Qing just to bat ineffectually at Wen Ning\u2019s face, possibly trying to rub off some of the blood smudged along his jaw but not doing a very good job of it.</p>\n<p>There are sect rules against envy. He just can\u2019t remember them right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian, stop that,\u201d Wen Qing says, shoving his arms back down to his sides. \u201cWe\u2019re fine. Are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying waves his hand, as if that\u2019s a ridiculous question, and Uncle says, \u201cIf you\u2019re uninjured, perhaps you\u2019d like to explain how you were able to tamper with our wards and whose guqin you were using?\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the chatter dies down, everyone looking towards Wei Ying in interest, except for the Jiang siblings who seem nervous at the question. Which means they already know the answer, while everyone else doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying being the Jiang first disciple seems more and more plausible every time he sees him and the Jiang interact. Lan Wangji knows he isn\u2019t, that it doesn\u2019t make any sense for it to be true, but that Wei Ying and the Jiang have formed such a strong bond so quickly seems equally unlikely. One of them has to be true.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long, uncomfortable beat of silence. Then Wei Ying presses the back of his hand to his forehead and says, \u201cOh no \u2013 the ground \u2013 it\u2019s spinning!\u201d He dramatically falls backwards and Wen Ning has to hastily grab the front of his robes and yank him into his chest to keep him from falling to the ground.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is going to copy the rule about inappropriately coveting what isn\u2019t his to covet one hundred times. Possibly while doing a handstand.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, A-Xian!\u201d Jiang Yanli gasps loudly, hurrying over to his side. Jiang Cheng coughing into his hand to cover his smirk really isn\u2019t helping anything. \u201cMaster Lan, he\u2019s so exhausted from defending you and everyone in here from being slaughtered by Wen soldiers. Perhaps we can question him another time?\u201d</p>\n<p>All the Jiang have widened their eyes, adopting concerned and pleading poses. Except for Jiang Cheng, who\u2019s ducked behind Nie Huaisang in an attempt to hide his laughter. An obviously flawed plan, considering Nie Huaisang is several inches shorter than him.</p>\n<p>Uncle and Xichen are not at all moved by this display. If anything, he thinks his uncle might even be grinding his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can rest in the jingshi,\u201d he says. \u201cI will keep an eye on him, Uncle. You can question him when he wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle pinches the bridge of his nose, which is typically the precursor to him getting a punishment that will leave him sore for several days. But instead he just says, \u201cFine, Wangji. <em>Don\u2019t</em> let him out of your sight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not a problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose we should get started on the clean up,\u201d Uncle continues then slides his eyes over to Xiao Xingcheng and Song Lan. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate your assistance. Since you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Why are you here? </em>is the extremely obvious unasked question, but instead of answering they both give shallow bows and turn to start collecting what\u2019s left of the Wen bodies. Lan Wangji assumes the quick agreement comes from not wanting to explain how they ended up here, although he\u2019s also curious. Wei Ying had been surprised to see them too, so it hadn\u2019t been something he\u2019d planned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help too,\u201d Wen Qing says, the looks to her brother. \u201cGive Wei Wuxian to Lan Wangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Ning leans down to pick up Wei Ying\u2019s legs so he\u2019s holding him in a bridal carry and then stretches out his arms, offering Wei Ying to him.</p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t enough lines in the world to make up for his thought process right now. Uncle is going to have to punish him until he\u2019s his age at this rate.</p>\n<p>He knows that Wei Ying isn\u2019t actually passed out, but he\u2019s doing a very good imitation of it, his body heavy and pliant. Lan Wangji adjusts his hold until Wei Ying\u2019s head is against his shoulder, which ends up being a mistake.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns around and starts walking towards his home and when they\u2019re a dozen steps away from the crowd, Wei Ying opens his mouth and blows a raspberry against his neck, his mouth warm and wet and his teeth sharp against his skin.</p>\n<p>He should probably just turn in his forehead ribbon.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli is following them, which is likely for the best. He feels as if he needs a chaperone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>There are no records of Baoshan Sanren playing the guqin.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s plenty happening, and even more that needs his attention, but Lan Qiren can\u2019t help the niggling sensation that thangs aren\u2019t fitting together properly.</p>\n<p>They have plenty of historical documents about the immortal, fractured and inconsistent as they might be. She and Lan An had been good friends from all accounts and for a while she\u2019d lingered in the mortal world, dropping in on Lans who could never refuse a visit from their founder\u2019s sworn sister. Lan Yi had reportedly been close with her, but the records are rather \u2013 sparse, from the time period.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no proof that Baoshan Sanren killed Lan Yi. But the disappearance of both Lan Yi and Baoshan Sanren at about the same time, and considering exactly what her notes from that time looked like, it seems obvious.</p>\n<p>He supposes that Baoshan Sanren could have picked up the guqin during the decades she not only knew Lan An but lingered around Cloud Recesses. But there\u2019s nothing that <em>says</em> that, and someone would have noticed, someone would have thought that notable enough to write down.</p>\n<p>More than that, he thinks that Cangse Sanren would have said something. She hadn\u2019t talked often of her master, but she had mentioned her, had been just as insufferable and talented as her son is now.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren had seen that sword style exhibition once before, although Cangse Sanren hadn\u2019t been able to convince the other clans to help her demonstrate them when she\u2019d done it.</p>\n<p>Cangse Sanren hadn\u2019t hidden her status as Baoshan Sanren\u2019s disciple either. Xiao Xingchen has always been open about his origin. He doesn\u2019t understand why Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t, what it is that he could possibly be hiding that he doesn\u2019t want to be known as Baoshan Sanren\u2019s disciple.</p>\n<p>Had the immortal kicked him off her mountain? Are the Jiang working with Baoshan Sanren? Is he only pretending to be badly lying about being Baoshan Sanren\u2019s disciple and is actually a secret cultivator raised the Wen clan to infiltrate Cloud Recesses and kill them all?</p>\n<p>The last one, at least, seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>But Lan Qiren doesn\u2019t <em>know</em>. All he knows is that Wei Wuxian is more powerful than any boy his age has a right to be and that he\u2019s lying. It\u2019s not a good combination.</p>\n<p>And that guqin he\u2019d used \u2013 and the skill he\u2019s used it with \u2013 does nothing to settle his nerves.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Xichen says, angling himself so no one can see him reaching out to tug on his sleeve in concern. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Such a well behaved, attentive boy, who doesn\u2019t run away with dangerous, lying cultivators and fight armies on his own.</p>\n<p>When everything settles he\u2019s going to make Wangji stay in a handstand until he collapses.</p>\n<p>\u201cLight the pyre,\u201d he says instead of answering.</p>\n<p>Who could have taught Wei Wuxian those songs? He\u2019s not even going to thing about the wards right now. He already has a headache.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang does his best to keep from being beaten to death by A-Yao, which mostly means running away. He\u2019s originally been planning to hide in the dorms, but there\u2019s still an awful lot of blood and dead bodies there right now. Wen Ning has helpfully stacked the bodies all together and it looks like he mopped up the blood from his sister\u2019s massacre, but he seems to have not taken into account that many of the bodies are still \u2026 leaking.</p>\n<p>His next stop is the girls dorms. Pretty much everyone is still trying to clean up the mess of the battle, so he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll mind. He\u2019ll just stay in his cousin\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s feeling really proud of himself up until he closes Nie Hua\u2019s door behind him to see Meng Yao sitting on her bed and glaring at him. \u201cForgot about the corpses, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a nonzero chance that he\u2019s faster than A-Yao. He could sprint and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>Except once he gets back to the Unclean Realm, A-Yao will definitely make him regret it. He\u2019s the only one that can get away with punishing him besides Mingjue. He does it far less often, but that just means he saves it for when Nie Huaisang really pisses him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says sullenly, crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>A-Yao narrows his eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019d come to me with a problem, I wouldn\u2019t have told Lan Xichen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like him,\u201d he says and winces. He\u2019d really meant to keep that bitterness in his head out and off his lips.</p>\n<p>His eyebrows dip together. \u201cAm I not a Nie general? Did your brother not send me specifically to keep you out of trouble? How I feel about Lan Xichen is inconsequential. You are my responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p>Responsibility. Right.</p>\n<p>A-Yao huffs and pinches the bridge of his nose. Normally getting him to this level of frustration would put a smile on his face, but Nie Huaisang can\u2019t manage it just then. \u201cWhat is Sect Leader Nie going to say when he hears about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us,\u201d he grumbles, \u201cyou can just call him by his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yao raises an eyebrow then takes a deep breath. \u201cOkay. What is Mingjue going to say when he hears that I didn\u2019t know what you were getting up to? That you didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell me? That our clan members were in a battle and I didn\u2019t know anything about it and couldn\u2019t protect them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him that it\u2019s because of me. He won\u2019t blame you. He \u2013 um, don\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He loves A-Yao. He won\u2019t blame him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you didn\u2019t tell me in the first place,\u201d and oh no, he doesn\u2019t sound mad anymore, but this is even worse. \u201cYou think a couple kisses from Lan Xichen is enough for me to forget my place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe KISSED YOU?\u201d Nie Huaisang screeches.</p>\n<p>A-Yao rubs at his forehead. \u201cStop trying to change the subject and talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho does he think he is?\u201d he snaps, nearly vibrating in place. \u201cHe can\u2019t \u2013 without discussing it with us, just because he\u2019s the clan heir \u2013 Mingjue is the clan head! So! Can\u2019t he see? Don\u2019t his eyes work? You\u2019re in Nie robes and Nie braids and he\u2019s not allowed to kiss you!\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes about five seconds of silence for Nie Huaisang\u2019s sense to catch up with him. He shouldn\u2019t have said it like that, now A-Yao is going to be mad at him and Lan Xichen is going to be mad at him and Mingjue is going to be fucking furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really been worried about this,\u201d A-Yao says. He doesn\u2019t sound mad. \u201cIt\u2019s not serious, Huaisang. There\u2019s no reason for him to talk to Mingjue about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Yao is really smart. He should know better. \u201cLan Xichen wouldn\u2019t risk upsetting Mingjue if he wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one is upsetting Mingjue,\u201d A-Yao says. He steps forward and grabs his wrist, forcing Nie Huaisang to sit next to him on the bed. \u201cI like Lan Xichen. He\u2019s a good friend and a good kisser. But you\u2019re right \u2013 I\u2019m Nie. Now stop panicking about something that\u2019s never going to happen and tell me everything you know about this attempted attack by the Wen and how you got involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang isn\u2019t completely convinced. Kissing or no kissing, he\u2019s known Lan Xichen his whole life, and he\u2019s never seen him interested in someone the way he\u2019s interested in A-Yao. But it\u2019s enough that A-Yao thinks it and that he\u2019s not planning on leaving.</p>\n<p>He won\u2019t betray Wei Wuxian\u2019s trust by telling A-Yao any of the thing he\u2019s guessed, even if he\u2019s certain he\u2019s right, but there\u2019s no reason to dig in his heels about how Wen Qing asked Wei Wuxian and Jiang Yanli for help and it all spiraled from there, so he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He starts talking. A-Yao knows him well enough to know that he\u2019s holding something back, but their previous conversation must have unbalanced him at least a little bit, because he doesn\u2019t push.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is flipping through all of Lan Zhan\u2019s books and despairing at the state of them. Nothing but dull poetry, sword forms, and even duller philosophy written by past Lans. He doesn\u2019t find anything written by Aunt Yi, which is a bit of a disappointment. Possibly it\u2019s because of her stint with experimenting with Yin Iron made her an unsuitable subject for moral teachings, but also very possibly because all her poetry was dirty limericks about Aunt Baoshan.</p>\n<p>He should borrow some books from Nie Huaisang for Lan Zhan\u2019s bookshelf. It\u2019s important for a young man to receive a well rounded education.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to hide forever, A-Xian,\u201d Yanli-jie says, kneeling at Lan Zhan\u2019s table and making tea. Lan Zhan is hovering anxiously, likely because he\u2019s breaking some Lan rule about hospitality by letting her brew the tea rather than doing it himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to hide forever,\u201d he says, abandoning looking through Lan Zhan\u2019s things for now so he can sprawl next to her. Just until Aunt Yi comes back. \u201cDo you think your parents have heard about everything yet? Are they going to be mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yanli-jie goes completely still, nearly overflowing a cup before jerking the teapot upright. \u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shares a startled look with Lan Zhan, trying to think of every rumor he\u2019s ever heard of the Jiang, but none of that matches up with her reaction. Sect Leader Jiang is, by all accounts, remarkably easy going for someone in his position, although then again Jiang sect leaders usually are. \u201cYanli-jie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll probably stay home,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s a distant look in her eyes like she\u2019s not seeing them. He doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s talking to them. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like leaving the pier, and really, it\u2019s not smart for both of them to leave if they\u2019re worried about the Wen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Did something happen while he and Jiang Cheng were fighting? He hopes she didn\u2019t hit her head. Wen Qing had been standing right next to her, if something had happened then she would have healed her. He reaches out to grab her forearm. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>She startles, blinking several times before an uneasy smile spreads across her face. \u201cOf course I am, A-Xian.\u201d She presses the too full cup of tea into his hands and he immediately spills some on himself. She did that on purpose.</p>\n<p>Yanli-jie pours another cup of tea then forces it into Lan Zhan\u2019s hands. She stands, smoothing her hands down the front of her skirt. \u201cI just have to \u2013 um, take care of something, really quick. If anyone asks, I\u2019ll tell them that you\u2019re still recuperating. Be good for Lan Wangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYanli-jie!\u201d he tries, putting down the tea and scrambling to his feet, but Yanli-jie can move quickly when she wants to. She\u2019s already out the door and there\u2019s probably not anyone watching Lan Zhan\u2019s home, but if there is then him running out after Yanli-jie will make it really obvious that he\u2019s awake.</p>\n<p>He huffs and sits back down at the space she\u2019d just left, sprawling so he can press his leg up against Lan Zhan\u2019s. \u201cI wonder what that was about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Lan Zhan hums and drinks his tea. Apparently he doesn\u2019t have any opinions about Yanli-jie\u2019s behavior, or more likely he has an opinion and it involves some sort of rude gossip that it breaks a rule to repeat.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian pulls the leg not touching Lan Zhan to his chest so he can lean against it then sips at the tea. It\u2019s bland, but he assumes it\u2019s all that Yanli-jie had to work with. It\u2019s not bitter, at least.</p>\n<p>The silence isn\u2019t awkward or uncomfortable, but Wei Wuxian can\u2019t let it linger. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks into his tea cup and remains silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me anything,\u201d he repeats. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know what you were following us into or what I\u2019d done, and you helped us, and you\u2019re not going to ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cYour actions were to protect Cloud Recesses and my clansmen. Demands are not in accordance with gratitude.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s definitely a rule, but Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t buying it.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan sighs and lifts his head to meet his eyes. \u201cYou lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he says but then doesn\u2019t know where to go from here. He does lie. He has to lie.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not want your lies,\u201d he continues, and it\u2019s something that should be said meanly, but Lan Zhan just sounds gentle. \u201cI trust you. There is no need for you to lie to me. So I will not ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gapes. \u201cBut if you know I\u2019m lying \u2013 er, if you think I\u2019m lying \u2013 then how can you trust me? That doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cIf someone\u2019s actions do not match their words, then it\u2019s not their words that I\u2019ll rely on. It makes perfect sense. Wei Ying is trustworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a rule against baseless optimism or something?\u201d he asks, throat tight.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan lifts his cup to take another sip. \u201cThere is not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is going to miss him so much when he has to go back home.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Dafan Wens have control of the Nightless City which means it\u2019s time for them to go and make sure their child is still in one piece.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming?\u201d Lan Yi asks, eyes wide. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to \u2013 I though, that this was just an exception.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are my exception,\u201d Baoshan Sanren says fondly, reaching out to straighten Lan Yi\u2019s robes even though they don\u2019t need it. \u201cYou went to your cave and so I retreated to my mountain. But you\u2019re here. Why would I be anywhere else?\u201d An unpleasant thought makes worry spike through her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to continue hiding, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Yi shakes her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to. I left my guqin with Wuxian and told him how to get into the secret library. They won\u2019t believe him if I don\u2019t show up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could talk his way out of it,\u201d Baoshan Sanren says confidently. Honestly, she\u2019ll be surprised if he bothered to try and explain it at all. Even with the backing of Jiang Yanli, the truth is too strange to be believable. Lan Yi isn\u2019t thinking of that because she\u2019s spent hundreds of years being too strange to be believable, but Wei Wuxian has spent enough time off her mountain to know better.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi elbows her in the side. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. He has us. He doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she murmurs, grabbing onto her elbow and pulling Lan Yi closer so she can press their foreheads together. \u201cHe does have us.\u201d</p>\n<p>They should hurry up and go save Wuxian from getting into any more trouble, but Baoshan Sanren thinks he won\u2019t begrudge them a few extra minutes.</p>\n<p>Just long enough for her to kiss Lan Yi breathless.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cJin Zixuan,\u201d Jiang Yanli says, pushing her way into his room, \u201cI need-\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo learn to knock?\u201d Jin Zixun asks crankily, but most of the bite she\u2019s used to hearing in his voice is gone.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan is sitting on the edge of his bed, naked from the waist up and his hair pulled over his shoulder as his cousin wipes at a wound curling around the swell of his shoulder. She feels heat pull to her face, and considers backing away and pretending this never happened, but instead she swallows and lifts her chin.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll see far more than his chest when they\u2019re married, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says, hoping that her voice comes out even. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you get hit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d he flushes, the redness starting at his neck and creeping downwards. \u201cIt was in the beginning, before we got \u2013 there was a rhythm to it, in the end, but it took us a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d she says, even though she doesn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have much experience with combat and if there\u2019s a pattern to it then it\u2019s one she never learned. \u201cThe Lan have healers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Zixuan looks away from her and mumbles something that she can\u2019t quite make out.</p>\n<p>She waits to see if he\u2019ll repeat himself, but instead the silence stretches out. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He mumbles again and she still can\u2019t understand him.</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun rolls his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re mean and they make us eat gross soup and the wound isn\u2019t even that bad. It\u2019ll be mostly healed by the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course it will. Jin Zixuan has a strong golden core, so injuries and illness mean little to him. He\u2019s probably never even had a cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too rough,\u201d she says, stepping fully into the room. She holds out her hand for the cloth. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun looks rapidly between her outstretched hand and Jin Zixuan before huffing, slapping it into her palm, and stomping towards the door. \u201cWhatever, I have better things to do anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slams the door shut behind him, leaving her and Jin Zixuan alone together. It\u2019s not proper. Or maybe it is. He is her future husband. If she\u2019s going to be alone with any man outside of her clan, then it would have to be him. The rumors would be intolerable if it was with anyone else.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli dampens the cloth with water from his bedside table, ignoring the way the blood spreads and smears across her hands. She sits on the bed next to Jin Zixuan, who\u2019s looking straight ahead and so tense that she doesn\u2019t think it can be comfortable.</p>\n<p>Maybe she should leave.</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t told her to leave.</p>\n<p>The wound is barely bleeding now, starting at the top of his shoulder and curling to nearly his inner elbow. If she had a wound like this then she\u2019d need stitches, but she\u2019s grown up around enough strong cultivators to know it would only make the healing worse if she tried. Instead she dabs it clean, holding it against his skin when the removal of dirt, sweat, and dried blood causes it to start bleeding anew. She doesn\u2019t have a bandage, but for an injury so small on a cultivator as strong as Jin Zixun, pressure and time will do the job just as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks up to find Jin Zixun staring at her, his lips pulled down into a frown. He\u2019s always frowning at her, but for once it doesn\u2019t feel personal. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you needed something, when you came in,\u201d he says. He\u2019s so warm underneath her hands. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she swallows. \u201cI want to tell my father that everything\u2019s fine before the rumors can get to him. Can you send a messenger butterfly for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can,\u201d he says. She frowns and he adds, \u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli lifts the cloth. The wound has stopped bleeding. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>They have a room in Caiyi, but Xiao Xingchen graciously accepts the offer of a room in Cloud Recesses for him and Song Lan because he still doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with Ying-di and he\u2019s not going to leave until he finds out. He can only hide for so long before Lan Qiren loses his patience and drags him out in front of everyone, fake faint or not.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s surprised that Lan Qiren let Ying-di get away with that, but he supposes that\u2019s what having to clean up and dispose of that many corpses will do. Especially since Ying-di had gone off with Lan Wangji, and Lan Qiren could obviously trust his nephew to keep an eye on him.</p>\n<p>Although. Lan Wangji <em>had</em> been one of the kids fighting off the Wens and clearly hadn\u2019t told his uncle or brother why.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop thinking so loudly,\u201d Song Lan mumbles, his face pressed into the pillow. \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lans should be getting up soon anyway,\u201d he says, walking over to the window to look at the slow creep of the sun over the horizon. \u201cI need to speak to Ying-di alone. Acting Sect Leader Lan\u2019s questions and my own are not the same. Why is he pretending to be the first disciple of the Jiang? Why are the letting him? When did he leave the mountain, and why didn\u2019t he come to me? It can\u2019t have been that long ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ying-di is too remarkable to go unnoticed for long. But that means that even if Ying-di didn\u2019t know how to find him, then he should have heard of him. Or at least Song Lan should have, since he\u2019s the one that pays attention to those sorts of things.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Song Lan says, jerking Xiao Xingchen out of his thoughts. Song Lan isn\u2019t lying in bed anymore, instead standing next to him with a very concerning look on his face. \u201cMaybe I need more sleep. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m awake yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that early,\u201d he protests, trying to sound exasperated, but he can hear the fondness in his own voice.</p>\n<p>Song Lan lifts a hand and points out the window.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen follows his finger to the horizon and freezes, blinking rabidly in case it makes what he\u2019s seeing start to make sense, but he has no such luck.</p>\n<p>Master Baoshan is flying towards them, sharing her sword with a Lan woman he doesn\u2019t recognize. She\u2019s wearing her typical white robes heavily embroidered in silver with her pure white hair flying out behind her, the combination so notorious that her identity is obvious even to people who don\u2019t know her face.</p>\n<p>Somehow, he just knows that this is Ying-di\u2019s fault. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, grabbing Song Lan\u2019s wrist and tugging him towards the door.</p>\n<p>Except Song Lan resists, yanking his hand away and scrambling backwards. \u201cNo, I have to get changed! I can\u2019t meet your mo-master like this!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so out of character for him that Xiao Xingchan can only stare. \u201cOkay. Um, hurry? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Song Lan gives a sharp nod and then hurries to pull off his robe. Xiao Xingchen watches as they descend, landing in what he thinks is the main courtyard of Cloud Recesses. That means whoever this Lan is, she at least has a jade token, so she probably really is a Lan and isn\u2019t just dressed like one.</p>\n<p>By the time they make it down there, Master Baoshan has her arms crossed and is tapping her foot impatiently while the Lan woman gives her an exasperated look. \u201cHe\u2019s probably still asleep. They did fight a battle yesterday. Give him some time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d she scoffs. \u201cYou did most of the work and you weren\u2019t even there.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been years since he\u2019s seen Master Baoshan. He never thought that he\u2019d see her again, but she\u2019s been frozen by immortality for hundreds of years, and if he had he\u2019d have thought that she would look the same as when he saw her last. But something about her is different. Lighter.</p>\n<p>The Lan woman sees him first and her smile freezes before widening. She nudges Master Baoshan in the side. \u201cWell, at least one of our children is prompt.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s frowning when she turns to face him, but that frown instantly slips into a smile when her eyes meet his. \u201cXingchen! What are you doing here? Come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Baoshan,\u201d he greets, starting to go into a formal bow.</p>\n<p>She grips his elbows then yanks him forward into a hug, her arms encircling him and squeezing him so tightly that he\u2019s instantly transported back into being a kid again, back when in his master\u2019s arms was the safest place he knew.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s an adult now. But he thinks that maybe that\u2019s still true.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you leave the mountain?\u201d he asks, refusing to feel disappointed when she pulls back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Master Baoshan waves a dismissive hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just your younger brother causing problems, as usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Lan woman frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can reasonably be said to have caused these problems. Exacerbated them, perhaps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop defending him,\u201d she glares. \u201cYou have to be on my side. I\u2019ve known you longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes, but is saved by responding but an excited voice yelling out, \u201cAunt Yi! You\u2019re back!\u201d</p>\n<p>They all turn to see Ying-di hurrying up the path, his robes disheveled and sloppily tied with his hair uncombed and flying out behind him. There\u2019s a little paperman clinging to his collar. Lan Wangji follows behind him at a more sedate pace, perfectly put together and unbothered.</p>\n<p>The moment Ying-di sees Master Baoshan, he lunges for Lan Wangji and slaps a hand over his eyes. A wasted gesture, since Lan Wangji has already seen them, and Xiao Xingchen feels like covering his own face in despair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, unbothered by Ying-di groping his face.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen\u2019s eyes narrow. He hadn\u2019t noticed that yesterday. The second jade of Lan is speaking to his younger brother in an awfully familiar fashion. Maybe he should have been more worried at the two of them spending the night under one roof.</p>\n<p>\u201cWuxian, what are you doing?\u201d Master Baoshan snaps. \u201cKnock that off and come over here so I can beat you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He scoffs. \u201cWhat am I doing? What are <em>you </em>doing? If you wanted me to come home, then you could have told Aunt Yi! Or something! What if someone sees you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Yi. The Lan woman is Lan Yi. That explains several things and raises questions about several others.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came here so they could see me. How else am I supposed to explain you running around and causing a mess about everything?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>Outrage steals across Ying-di\u2019s face and he removes his hands from Lan Wangji\u2019s face to place them on his hips. \u201cI didn\u2019t cause any mess! I helped clean up the mess! You can\u2019t blame me for things I didn\u2019t do, none of this is my fault!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of it, huh?\u201d Master Baoshan\u2019s eyes narrow in a way that usually meant they were going to be running drills until one of them collapsed. \u201cSo all this time running around villages, sneaking in to see Lan Yi, and sticking your nose into anything interesting you came across, and all of this has <em>nothing</em> to do with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen blinks. \u201cYou\u2019ve left the mountain before? Ying-di! Have you no respect for your status as an immortal\u2019s disciple?\u201d He turns to Master Baoshan. \u201cYou should have thrown him out after the first time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Master Baoshan is cackling but now Ying-di is directing his outrage towards him. \u201cExcuse me? I\u2019ve been leaving the mountain for years! Just because you never bothered to question where all the chili oil came from-\u201d</p>\n<p>Master Baoshan coughs and Ying-di\u2019s mouth slams shut as he looks up, suddenly fascinated with the sky and refusing to look in his direction.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never thought about the chili oil before. \u201cHow long have you been leaving the mountain?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ying-di refuses to answer him. He turns to Master Baoshan.</p>\n<p>She looks between them and says, \u201cIt\u2019s all about choosing your own path and having the room to make your own choices-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTHE WHOLE TIME?\u201d he shouts. \u201cYou were just letting Ying-di roam around all on his own? He\u2019s a kid! What if something happened to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just to the village at first,\u201d she defends at the same time that Ying-di says, \u201cHey! I can take care of myself! I didn\u2019t even get involved in that many night hunts on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did nighthunts on your own?\u201d Master Baoshan asks dangerously, eyes narrowed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t search them out, did you? All those times you told me you just stumbled across something-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d Ying-di says loudly, \u201chello everyone, this is Lan Wangji. Lan Zhan, this is Aunt Baoshan, Aunt Yi, and my brother Xingchen-ge, and his, er, partner Song Lan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why that pause before partner? Song Lan is his partner. Ying-di and Song Lan have barely even met, what does Ying-di think that that he\u2019s implying?</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Lan Yi says, inclining her head to Song Lan who responds with a deep bow. \u201cLan Wangji, I\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ying-di shoots her a betrayed look that she pretends not to see.</p>\n<p>Xiao Xingchen isn\u2019t really sure how the immortal that everyone thought was dead is still alive and how she knows both Master Baoshan and Ying-di, but he thinks he likes her.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet all of you as well,\u201d Lan Wangji returns, bowing. He\u2019s handling meeting two immortals with surprising grace. \u201cI believe it would be best for you to speak to my uncle. He has many questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ying-di pulls a move that Xiao Xingchen has never seen anyone but a Lan do and summons a shimmering guqin in front of him. \u201cHere, Aunt Yi. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt worked, then?\u201d she asks, smiling as she picks up the guqin and it disappears in her hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally well,\u201d he answers, and Xiao Xingchen has to agree with the awe he can hear in his brother\u2019s voice. Watching Ying-di wield that guqin had been terrifying. \u201cIf I\u2019d known that was going to happen, I wouldn\u2019t have messed with the wards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Yi blinks. \u201cWhat did you do with the wards?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji snorts and Wei Wuxian unsubtly stomps on his foot. \u201cNothing, don\u2019t worry about it, we should really go see Lan Qiren-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, was it not Lady Lan\u2019s intention to trap all of Cloud Recesses behind the safety of the wards while a handful of teenagers faced the Wen army on their own?\u201d Xiao Xingchen asks.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t feel at all bad about this. Ying-di has been going up and down the mountain since they were children!</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Lan Yi demands. Nothing much about her expression changes, but it feels like the temperature drops at least ten degrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Master Baoshan says smugly. \u201cAlso, Wuxian, I\u2019m going make you run drills until a limb falls off. Maybe if you have a little less energy, you\u2019ll cause less problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle tried that,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He snaps his mouth shut and red creeps up his neck towards his ears. Master Baoshan is laughing and Lan Yi presses her lips together, likely to prevent the same.</p>\n<p>Ying-di whines, \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d and goes on his tip toes to dramatically drape himself over Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Even if all he does is cause trouble, Xiao Xingchen is glad that Ying-di is here.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s missed his brother.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren really isn\u2019t prepared for two immortals in his house. Xichen at least has the good sense to be surprised and nervous when he arrives, while Wangji is just acting like all this is perfectly normal. Lan Qiren sits patiently as they explain all those things that had seemed unexplainable to him, and he despairs that the truth is actually so much stranger than anything he\u2019d thought up.</p>\n<p>He shifts his gaze onto Wei Wuxian. \u201cA rogue cultivator, hm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically,\u201d he starts, pointing a finger towards the sky for emphasis.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren cuts him off by whacking him upside the head without looking at him. Wei Wuxian yelps and clutches his head, pouting in a way that makes him look a quarter his age.</p>\n<p>This explains several things about Cangse Sanren. Clearly Xiao Xingchen is the outlier here</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Lan,\u201d he says after several moments deliberating how to address her. She\u2019s not the sect leader anymore, but she was, and she was taught by Lan An. It seems a shade too informal, but she doesn\u2019t seem offended. Clearly she can\u2019t be that concerned with formalities if she\u2019s letting Wei Wuxian call her aunt. \u201cWe were under the impression that you\u2019d died at Baoshan Sanren\u2019s hand after sealing away the Yin Iron.\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence takes on a decidedly awkward air.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian snorts. \u201cThis is what happens when you seal yourself in a cave and run away to a mountain without talking to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Wei Wuxian dodges Baoshan Sanren\u2019s slap, but doesn\u2019t manage to avoid her kick to his shin. Xichen looks down to hide his smile while Wangji lets his lips quirk up in the corners in front of everyone, which is a new behavior.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lan Yi clears her throat. \u201cClearly that\u2019s not what happened, although I can see how people could have came to that conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re going to have to revise so many texts. \u201cYes. I see. Where do we go from here, Lady Lan?\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t beat two immortals in a fight. He\u2019d be surprised if he could even give one of them a good workout. He could have been a great cultivator, perhaps, but the responsibilities and bureaucracies of running a sect don\u2019t leave much time for training. He\u2019s not ashamed of his skills, but no one will be writing of him in any of the history books.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no interest in interfering with the clan,\u201d Lan Yi says firmly, understanding exactly what he\u2019s asking. His nephews startle, like that possibility hadn\u2019t even occurred to them. \u201cI am Lan. You are my sect and my family. If you ever have need of me, I will come, and if there\u2019s a war then I\u2019ll fight with you. But I\u2019ve missed so much of the world over the years, and I want to see it once more.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches out to take Baoshan Sanren\u2019s hand and the two immortals share a look that Lan Qiren wishes he didn\u2019t have to witness. So it\u2019s like that, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going traveling?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cWhat about the mountain? People are going to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wangji looks away then. Xichen tries to catch his brother\u2019s attention and frowns when he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cBaoshan and I are going traveling,\u201d Lan Yi says gently. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come with us, of course, and it\u2019s likely that Xingchen will be joining us. But things are different now, Wuxian. Baoshan has left her mountain. You don\u2019t have to choose between a life with us or a life dictated by your own desires.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks, mouth falling open, and Wangji\u2019s head snaps to his direction.</p>\n<p>The door slams open and several teenagers burst inside. He barely catches a glimpse of Nie Huaisang rolling his eyes before running away. What\u2019s the use of having a patrol if they don\u2019t catch people eaves dropping on his conversations?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. \u201cYou have to! I\u2019ll talk to my dad about you really being our first disciple, you\u2019re doing the work already-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wen Qing slaps his shoulder. \u201cWhy did you open the door? You could have waited and now we\u2019ve been caught-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQing-jie, please,\u201d Wen Ning says, ineffectually tugging on his sister\u2019s sleeve in a poor attempt at preventing her from hitting Jiang Cheng.</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli rushes forward and falls to her knees in front of Wei Wuxian, grabbing his hands in her own. \u201cOh, A-Xian, don\u2019t go! You\u2019ll really love Lotus Pier, and we can go swimming together and I\u2019ll cook for you and everyone loves you, please don\u2019t go!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at Jiang Yanli then turns to Jiang Cheng, who\u2019s watching him with an equally pleading expression. He swallows. \u201cAunt Baoshan, you really don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren shakes her head, her expression soft. \u201cYou will always be my child and I hope your mother believes I\u2019ve raised you well. But you are your father\u2019s son too. There is nothing dishonorable about you joining the Jiang, if that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s grin is so large that it\u2019s nearly splitting his face in half. \u201cOkay. I \u2013 okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Jiang siblings tackle him in their excitement while the Wens use the distraction to make a very unsubtle escape.</p>\n<p>Lan Qiren can\u2019t even cause that much of a fuss about anything since he doesn\u2019t want to offend the two immortals, but Wangji is smiling again, so he doesn\u2019t much want to either.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t wait for the foreign disciples to go home so that things can get back to normal around here.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>So much has happened since Wei Wuxian first took her to the cold springs that Jiang Yanli had nearly forgotten what started all of this in the first place. When the two immortals ask to examine her, she agrees, but brings her brothers with her. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t trust Baoshan Sanren and Lan Yi, of course, it\u2019s just that she wants Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian with her. Whatever happens.</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren presses her fingers to her wrist, activates several talismans over her, and trades a grimace with Lan Yi that makes her instantly nauseous with worry. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Baoshan Sanren hurries to assure her, but her smile isn\u2019t as comforting as it would have been a moment ago. \u201cYou weren\u2019t born breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Cheng shoots a sharp glance to the windows, then frowns. \u201cHow can you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mother must have been desperate to save you,\u201d Baoshan Sanren says and she knows without looking that she and A-Cheng flinch at the same time. \u201cYou should have died. But she must have poured cultivation energy into you, forcing your body to heal itself and quickening your breath. It\u2019s very dangerous, especially for someone that\u2019s just given birth, and rarely works. At best, the child will make it another couple of days before going cold and the birthing parent tends to follow not long after.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Yanli-jie didn\u2019t die!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, looking at her anxiously as if she\u2019d turned into a ghost without him noticing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYu Ziyuan is powerful,\u201d Baoshan Sanren, \u201cand very reckless. The first year of your life must have been nerve wracking for her. Every time your heart skipped a beat, she would have used her own energy to steady it. This saved your life. But it also meant your core never got the chance to develop normally. The paths your mother carved to your core led not inward, but outward.\u201d She gestures to Jiang Yanli\u2019s sword. \u201cYou\u2019ve been able to retain very little of the immense power you\u2019ve spent your life cultivating. Most of it has been directed towards your blade, something outside of yourself that your core was connected to. Without the energy to repair yourself from the constant cultivation, it\u2019s affected your physical health as well. Cultivators\u2019 ability to heal themselves from the damages of their expanding cultivation powers rises <em>with</em> the expansion of those powers. Cultivation energy harms as much as it heals, but you\u2019ve only ever had the energy for the harm and not the healing.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is why she can\u2019t wield her own sword. Why she mediates and trains and it only ever seems to make her weaker. Why she has never, ever been able to live up to her title as the first born heir of the Jiang.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not her fault.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not her <em>fault</em>!</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you know what\u2019s wrong, then you can fix it, can\u2019t you?\u201d A-Cheng asks anxiously.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi starts to shake her head, then shrugs. \u201cNot \u2013 exactly. Baoshan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Baoshan Sanren presses her lips together before sighing. \u201cYou have a choice to make, Lady Jiang.\u201d She startles at the formal address. Baoshan Sanren must be serious. \u201cYou can continue as you are. Outside healing can mitigate some of the damage, but you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life falling ill. You\u2019ll be a weak cultivator, but a cultivator still. Or I can burn away the channels of your core that lead outwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBurn away!\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats, horrified. \u201cBut she \u2013 she needs those!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo cultivate,\u201d Baoshan Sanren continues gently. \u201cTo wield a cultivation blade and move that energy out of her body. Even talismans will be outside of her grasp now. But, Lady Jiang, your core will be able grow. It will stabilize. Most of the damage will be healed and you\u2019ll gain the resistance to sickness and wounds that any other cultivator has. But you won\u2019t be able to receive any outside healing, so if something happens that your core can\u2019t fix, only the standard medicine will be able to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She won\u2019t get sick anymore? She won\u2019t be dizzy and weak and sore, won\u2019t be swept away by illnesses she can\u2019t predict or control?</p>\n<p>Turning her back on her cultivation is unthinkable. It\u2019s a gift and a miracle and something she\u2019s cherished and nourished her entire life. Choosing a life away from that warm, steady path is blasphemy among the clans. The things people will say about her will be vicious and mocking.</p>\n<p>This could jeopardize her engagement to Jin Zixuan. Her children will have strong cores, but renouncing her cultivation for any reason is grounds enough to break off a marriage, and Jin Zixuan has never seemed enthusiastic about their engagement. She likes him. She wants to marry him, and if she does this, maybe she won\u2019t.</p>\n<p>She won\u2019t get sick anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cBurn them,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-jie!\u201d A-Cheng snaps.</p>\n<p>She shakes her head and he falls silent. \u201cI will never be a cultivator our family can be proud of. I will never be strong enough to follow you into battle. I can\u2019t be the cultivator everyone wants me to be. But I can be <em>better</em>. I can live my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>A-Cheng quiets, his eyes going wide and wet. He swallows before nodding. \u201cOkay, A-jie. If this is what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is.</p>\n<p>She was born breathless and she\u2019s been struggling to catch her breath ever since. Maybe after this she\u2019ll finally be able to.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe recovery is an ordeal all on its own,\u201d Baoshan Sanren says, resting her hand on Jiang Yanli\u2019s back. \u201cLan Yi and I will accompany you back to Lotus Pier. We\u2019ll perform it there and stay with you until you\u2019re recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowns.</p>\n<p>Lan Yi puts her hand on her other shoulder. \u201cThis is your decision, Jiang Yanli. If your parents disagree, we\u2019ll explain that to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way she says it makes it sounds like that explanation will involved unsheathed blades and image of it alone is enough to make her crack a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Yanli-jie, don\u2019t worry!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouts, running forward to give her a hug that lifts her clean off her feet. \u201cA-Cheng and I will be right there with you and everything will be fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>She believes him.</p>\n<p>Everything is going to be fine.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji returns to the jingshi from midnight patrols to find someone sitting on his bed.</p>\n<p>He only panics for a second before he registers its Wei Ying, and then his heart beat quickens for an entirely different reason. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking curfew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Wei Ying,\u201d he says, jumping up to stand in front of him. He looks warm and comfortable and Lan Wangji wants to touch him. \u201cMy parents are Wei Changze and Cangse Sanren. After my parents died, I lived on the streets for a couple months until Baoshan Sanren found me, and she\u2019s raised me ever since. I grew up on her mountain with Xiao Xingchen and I\u2019ve spent my life coming and going from the mountain even though immortals\u2019 disciples really aren\u2019t supposed to do that. I\u2019ve been sneaking into Cloud Recesses to deliver letters from Aunt Baoshan to Aunt Yi for years and the night you caught me, that\u2019s what I was doing. My father was a Jiang but the first time I\u2019d met a Jiang was Yanli-jie when you called her to verify my story. I thought this was just going to be a quick stop for me until I could figure out a way to leave without getting Yanli-jie in trouble, but that changed. I don\u2019t have to leave and hide away again. I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows all this already, but that\u2019s not the point.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying swallows. \u201cI\u2019m not lying anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, not sure where to go from here. Wei Ying had a good reason to lie. He\u2019s not upset about it. He wants to know everything about Wei Ying\u2019s life, wants to hear about growing up with Baoshan Sanren and Xiao Xingchen and everything that Lan Yi has ever told him. But he doesn\u2019t need that. He trusts Wei Ying, and he was right to do so.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying anymore,\u201d he repeats. \u201cLan Zhan. I thought I was going to have to disappear back up the mountain with Aunt Baoshan, but now I don\u2019t have to, and Lotus Pier isn\u2019t all that far away from Cloud Recesses, comparatively.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure where Wei Ying is going with this, but he\u2019s clearly nervous, so he just confirms, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe they can see each other sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Wei Ying says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. If he can talk, he\u2019s still breathing, which is useful information.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s face falls, which is terrible. He looks warm and comfortable and Lan Wangji wants to touch him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying likes him.</p>\n<p>He closes the distance between them, lifting his hand fit the curve of Wei Ying\u2019s cheek in his palm. Wei Ying leans into him and tilts his head in a way Lan Wangji has dreamed bout.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying likes him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji leans even closer, tentatively pressing their lips together, and feels his heart leap into his throat when Wei Ying grabs his waist and tries to pull him impossibly closer.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying likes him.</p>\n<p>This has been a perfect summer.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t wait for the next one.</p>"
