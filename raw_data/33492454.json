  "notes": "<p>This is a story about the power of love and healing because I am, at my core, deeply predictable. It began as a 5+1 on the different people who could have trained Obi-Wan and then became an entire story in its own right. Because, again, predictable.</p>\n<p>Fanfiction is a fun way to explore new things and so I've done something new (to me) with the story and it's told from different points of view. Each chapter title will name the POV character. It's an exploration of Obi-Wan mostly from other people's perceptions of him. Which means it's far kinder to him than a story told from his own perspective (Exhibit A: Can't return to who I was before).</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Melida/Daan time! It happens differently than in canon, but canon warnings apply (violence, child soldiers, child death - not of this is explicit)</p>\n<p>POV is Anakin so warnings for child slavery and the abuses which come with it. Nothing explicit but the undercurrents are there.</p>\n<p>And so the Clone Wars begin : )</p>\n<p>Vod/vode - sibling (siblings) / sister (sisters) / brother (brothers)<br>Verd/verde - soldier (soldiers)<br>Baar'ur - medic</p>\n<p>It's Fizz's time! I have to say, I really enjoy the symmetry of the final chapters which go Cody-Rex-Fizz-Rex-Cody.</p>\n<p>Well...here we are. Thank you to everyone who has come on this journey with me. I hope you've enjoyed reading this story as much as I've enjoyed writing it.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Vokara Che enters the Council Chambers in time to hear Master Yoda say, \u201cSend him away, we must. A break from precedent, it is, but necessary, it also is.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know who Master Yoda refers to; though, as a Master Healer, Vokara Che is an intelligent woman. The Temple gossip mill churns, as it always does, and it appears that everyone, from the padawans to the knights to even the councilors are discussing the two initiates who wound up in Vokara\u2019s domain.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Vokara says, announcing her presence and her opinion at the same time. Her fellow Jedi greet her with a mix of irritation for the interruption and respect for her position.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy Initiate Chun\u2019s account, Initiate Kenobi attacked him from a place of anger and a misguided belief that besting him would prove his worth to a Jedi Master.\u201d Mace Windu speaks evenly, with the measured calm which makes him a good councilor. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd by Initiate Kenobi\u2019s account?\u201d Vokara asks.</p>\n<p>Master Dooku laughs quietly from his chair. \u201cWhy bother with the account of the accused when their fate is already decided?\u201d His derision is pointed, and even though he doesn\u2019t look toward his former master, Master Yoda\u2019s ears flatten against his head with the censure.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is dangerous,\u201d Master Droom says. He\u2019s a recent addition to the Council, and it doesn\u2019t surprise Vokara that he sides with Master Yoda. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all dangerous,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cIt\u2019s why the Jedi Order places an emphasis on control. I\u2019ve spoken with Initiate Kenobi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo have we,\u201d Master Droom interrupts. \u201cHe did not defend himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hauled a scared child in front of the most austere council in the galaxy. I\u2019m surprised he remembered his name.\u201d Vokara gives Master Droom a sharp look, warning him against further interruptions. </p>\n<p>\u201cInitiate Chun\u2019s wounds and Initiate Kenobi\u2019s lack of them corroborate Initiate Chun\u2019s account,\u201d Mace says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd none of you thought to consult their healer?\u201d Vokara\u2019s sharp look is now directed at Mace. She has the sense he wants her to speak her opinion, that he\u2019s guiding her to her conclusion. \u201cInitiate Chun does bear the marks of a fight. But so does Initiate Kenobi. It was unsanctioned, and neither of their actions befitted that of a Jedi, but it was not as one-sided as Initiate Chun would have you believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe saw Initiate Kenobi with our own eyes!\u201d Master Droom says. </p>\n<p>Once, a well-meaning colleague told Vokara that instead of seduction, the Twi\u2019lek gods gave her twice the sass. It\u2019s true, she doesn\u2019t have the allure that most of her species do, but it isn\u2019t something she ever cultivated. She is brisk, she is businesslike, and she doesn\u2019t put up with stupidity.</p>\n<p>The glare she directs at Master Droom suggests he not speak for the rest of this meeting. \u201cDid you look with more than your eyes?\u201d It was obvious they didn\u2019t. \u201cInitiate Kenobi, through basic healing skills, some bandages, and a judicious amount of notice-me-not, successfully hid his own wounds from the fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealing skills?\u201d Mace asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNotice-me-not?\u201d Master Dooku asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am making an offer to Initiate Kenobi,\u201d Vokara says, finally getting to why she came here. \u201cIf he accepts, I will train him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chaos breaks out for a moment as everyone shouts to be heard over each other. There are protests. There are concerns. There are outright refusals. Master Yoda knocks his stick against the ground. Three loud raps and the room falls silent.</p>\n<p>Vokara speaks before he can. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for your permission. I don\u2019t need it. I am a Master Healer, and it is my right to take an apprentice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you want Obi-Wan Kenobi?\u201d Master Windu asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vokara answers. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Vokara returns to the Halls of Healing after her meeting with the Council. She has duties to attend to and as much as she wants to find Obi-Wan and make her offer, there are things which must come first. </p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until there\u2019s a knock at her door that she wonders if delaying only gave others a chance to intervene. She looks at Mace and his offering of agaricum. He doesn\u2019t waver under her sharp stare. She sighs and waves him in. She takes the plate, because she is hungry, but she won\u2019t be bribed or distracted. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m making my offer,\u201d she tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not here to talk you out of it.\u201d Mace sits near the air vent, and Vokara can\u2019t help her smile. Agaricum is a Twi\u2019lek dish. Most sentients find the pungent odor unpleasant. \u201cMaster Yoda said he had a plan for Obi-Wan. He wasn\u2019t going to be left in the AgriCorps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he was still being sent there?\u201d Vokara shakes her head. Mace\u2019s silence is answer enough. \u201cObi-Wan was going to be told he isn\u2019t good enough, punished for being a failure, and then sent away so he could fall into Master Yoda\u2019s plan?\u201d She shakes her head again. \u201cWhat do you know about Obi-Wan Kenobi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace frowns as if he doesn\u2019t understand why Vokara is asking. He leans back in his chair, thinking, and she gives him the time to gather his response. \u201cHe is a near-human, actual species unknown. He was left on the Temple steps as an infant. He was raised in the Temple and has shown promise in lightsaber combat. Recently, he\u2019s become anxious and withdrawn. And most recently, he engaged in an unsanctioned fight which was supposed to result in his early release from the Temple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEarly release? Such a diplomat\u2019s way of putting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace raises his eyebrows. \u201cWhat would you call it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRejection. Expulsion.\u201d Vokara shrugs her shoulders. Both are harsh words and while Mace\u2019s expression suggests he believes them to be too harsh, she doesn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot all initiates are good fits to continue their path at the Temple,\u201d Mace says. \u201cWe aren\u2019t rejecting them. We\u2019re guiding them toward the correct path.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept you said it isn\u2019t an issue of Initiate Kenobi being unfit, it\u2019s part of a plan Master Yoda has.\u201d Vokara taps her fork on her plate. \u201cHe has harmed Initiate Kenobi. You say he has a reason for it. I don\u2019t care. Initiate Kenobi is a child, not a pawn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace takes a deep breath, but it isn\u2019t to marshal an argument. He looks tired, afterward. \u201cYou\u2019re correct. Master Yoda\u2019s age gives wisdom and insight into history, but it also sets him in his ways. He sees from a distance we don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our role to offer our insights and challenge him when necessary,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cOur Order is only as strong as those who lead it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am grateful for your voice,\u201d Mace says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my willingness to use it?\u201d Vokara smiles sharply. \u201cYou know my opinions on raising younglings. They should be surrounded by younglings similar in developmental age and guided by a diverse group of adults.\u201d She gives Mace a significant look.</p>\n<p>He meets it with an amused smile. He draws out the silence until Vokara starts tapping her fork again. \u201cAre you asking me to help you train Initiate Kenobi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll be a positive influence in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara is a medical professional which is why she spots the way Mace\u2019s fingers twitch as if he wants to touch his face and hide his embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment, Mace. You can\u2019t be that out of practice with receiving them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives in and laughs, a deep, rich sound. Vokara knows it is the right choice to offer to train Initiate Kenobi, but now she knows there are other Jedi who she can count on for support. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>There is a rumor that the healers live in the Halls of Healing which is ridiculous. They work in shifts, and they are discouraged from spending two shifts in the Halls and outright forbidden from three in a row. There is always work to be done but burning oneself out helps no one.</p>\n<p>After her shift, Vokara goes to the Room of a Thousand Fountains, a place she heard Initiate Kenobi visits with great frequency. It takes her some time to find him inside the vast room. He isn\u2019t by the waterfall as many of the younglings prefer. He isn\u2019t amongst the citrus groves. He isn\u2019t with the flowers or the most impressive of the fountains.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tucked out of the way, meditating by a shallow pond. Vokara sees flashes of color as the fish dart about in the water. She clears her throat and it\u2019s enough to draw Initiate Kenobi out of his meditation.</p>\n<p>His arms are covered by his tunics so she can\u2019t check on the progress of his injuries. She can see his face, though, and because she knows to look for it, she sees the shadow of bruises where he tries to project unblemished skin. He is quiet under her scrutiny, but his eyes widen just a bit as if he\u2019s afraid. He draws his shoulders up as if preparing to defend himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful here,\u201d Vokara says. She sweeps her robes aside as she kneels on the grass.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Initiate Kenobi agrees. He dips his fingers in the water and smiles as the fish mouth at his skin, curious at what\u2019s in their water. \u201cI\u2019ll miss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMy transport for the AgriCorps leaves tomorrow,\u201d Initiate Kenobi answers. His chin wobbles, but his voice doesn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe AgriCorps only accepts initiates,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cAnd if you would like to explore that path, I will not stand in your way. But I will offer you a second path. Would you like to be my padawan and learn the Jedi art of healing?\u201d </p>\n<p>Blue-gray eyes study her as if searching for any sign that this is a lie or a joke. \u201cIs this a true offer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Vokara promises. And then she answers the question he\u2019s too hesitant to ask. \u201cYou sped along your own healing which is something many Jedi can\u2019t do even with training. No one had flagged your file to indicate your potential for healing so I didn\u2019t observe you as closely as I should have. But I have noticed you now, and you are an initiate I would be proud to call padawan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Initiate Kenobi\u2019s eyes fill with hope. His expression is almost bright enough to be painful or perhaps that is pain Vokara feels, an ache in her chest at what might never have been. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an easy path. You will see the galaxy\u2019s suffering and its pain, and you\u2019ll never be able to help as much as you would like to. But you will help, just as all healers do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Initiate Kenobi says and Vokara doesn\u2019t understand how anyone thought he has an aggressive bone in his body. \u201cI would like to be your padawan and learn from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Vokara has enrolled Obi-Wan in several healing modules to supplement his course load. They are all basic courses in healing, in physiology, in biology, and even chemistry. There will be advanced courses to do as he completes his basic ones. It\u2019s an overwhelming amount of information to consider which is why Vokara limits his understanding of the scope. </p>\n<p>Healers, like Archivists, are required to hold an incredible amount of information in their heads at one time. </p>\n<p>In addition to more classes, Obi-Wan also spends a quarter-shift each day in the Halls of Healing. Right now, she has him shadow Healer Nikita so he learns the layout, how to organize the storeroom and sterilize the equipment. It\u2019s to acclimate him to the Halls which are a place where the Force is different. </p>\n<p>Not everyone can be a healer and not only because of ability. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s something deeper. To stand in the Halls of Healing is to stand inside a concerted distortion of the Force. The Force gives and the Force takes, but healers seek to reverse the course of life or speed up a natural healing process. They shape the Force to their needs, and it leaves some with shaking hands or numb mouths or buzzing heads.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan hasn\u2019t shown any ill-effects for his time in the Halls. He fetches supplies without complaint, he cleans instruments thoroughly, and he stares longingly when one of the healers attends to a patient as if he wants to do more. </p>\n<p>Vokara doesn\u2019t make him wait long.</p>\n<p>The Temple runs a clinic for any who need their services. No one is turned away, regardless of their ident, or lack of it, or their ability to pay. </p>\n<p>Today, Vokara\u2019s patient is a young humanoid girl with red eyes and a hacking cough. She sits on the table and swings her feet as Vokara and Obi-Wan approach. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am Healer Che,\u201d Vokara introduces. \u201cAnd this is my padawan, Obi-Wan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan wiggles his fingers in hello.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Sharice,\u201d the girl says. </p>\n<p>The girl\u2019s guardian, who sits in the chair by the door, shifts nervously as they look Obi-Wan over.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadawan means that Obi-Wan is my apprentice,\u201d Vokara tells Sharice. \u201cHe\u2019s learning to be a healer as well. He\u2019s going to sit over there,\u201d Vokara points to a meditation mat, \u201cand he\u2019s going to see what I see while I help you. But I\u2019m the one who is going to treat you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sharice keeps swinging her legs, but her guardian relaxes once they realize their child isn\u2019t being treated by a trainee. </p>\n<p>Vokara waits until Obi-Wan is seated and she can feel him slide through their bond to begin her examination. Obi-Wan hovers in the back of her mind, undeniably there, but only a visitor. He can see what she sees, can feel what she feels, and he can communicate with Vokara. It\u2019s the perfect training tool. He can have the full experience without any of the responsibility. </p>\n<p>\u201cLie down for me, please,\u201d Vokara tells Sharice. \u201cI\u2019m going to do a scan.\u201d She picks up her medical scanner and explains the settings to Obi-Wan as she selects the one she wants. She guides the scanner over Sharice\u2019s body. She lingers on the eyes, ears, throat, and chest. </p>\n<p>The scanner processes the information it received and then creates a report. It identifies the symptoms, and it offers probable ailments based on numerous factors. Unfortunately for Sharice, the most likely cause of her symptoms isn\u2019t curable but it is treatable. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are allergic to smog,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cDo you know what smog is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPollution,\u201d Sharice answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. The exhaust from all the vehicles in Coruscant irritates your throat and lungs. The best thing is fresh, clean air, but the second-best thing is antihistamines. I can give you a dose now. You\u2019ll need a monthly dose. You can make an appointment with our scheduling droid when we\u2019re finished today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara opens the cabinet with the common medications, the ones which don\u2019t need to be locked up. She selects the standard antihistamine, fills her hypospray with the correct amount for Sharice\u2019s age and species and then walks back to her patient. </p>\n<p>Sharice\u2019s wide brown eyes look at the needle with alarm. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara hadn\u2019t noticed Obi-Wan slipping out of their bond, but he did because he\u2019s now standing next to her. He offers Sharice a smile and then one of his hands. \u201cYou can hold my hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sharice, still looking at the needle, slips her small hand into Obi-Wan\u2019s equally small one. </p>\n<p>\u201cI like your dress,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>Sharice looks down at the garment. It\u2019s a multi-colored block dress which reminds Vokara more of an initiate\u2019s painting project than fashion, but Sharice blushes with the compliment. She tugs at one of the tassels on her dress. \u201cThank you. My aunt made it for me. She said I should wear it when I miss her. She\u2019s still on Brenli. That\u2019s where we used to live.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara waits until Sharice is absorbed in her conversation with Obi-Wan to inject her with the hypospray. It\u2019s barely even a pinch, and Sharice doesn\u2019t notice it, too busy telling Obi-Wan about a snowball fight she had with her cousins before she and her mom moved to Coruscant to live with her dad. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like snow?\u201d Sharice asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t snow on Coruscant,\u201d Obi-Wan answers. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know yet. Healer Che gave you your shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sharice twists to look at her arm. \u201cThat didn\u2019t even hurt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Vokara says. To both Sharice and her guardian, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re all set. Don\u2019t forget to make your follow-up appointment.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you get one of these!\u201d Obi-Wan uses the Force to call the jar of lollipops to him. He holds the jar out to Sharice. </p>\n<p>She picks through it until she finds a rainbow-colored lollipop. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says to Obi-Wan and then to Vokara. She tosses the wrapper in the trash and then sticks the sweet in her mouth as she leaves with her guardian. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d Vokara tells Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t always use the Force to help?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we can use medicine to help, we use medicine. That means we only have to use the Force when absolutely necessary. It\u2019s tiring to use the Force and there aren\u2019t very many Jedi trained to do it, so we want to spare them for emergencies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan contemplates this as he follows Vokara to the fresher to wash their hands before their next patient is shown in. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m going to learn how to do surgeries?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s where your focus takes you,\u201d Vokara answers. \u201cThere is too much for any one being to be able to do everything, so we take specialties. Some have a specialty in Force healing, others in surgery or infectious diseases. But even within those specialties, there are specialties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s looking overwhelmed so Vokara herds him toward the hand dryer. \u201cAnd you have an entire lifetime to learn it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if someone needs help before I\u2019ve learned how to help them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara crouches down so they\u2019re eye-to-eye, because this will be the most important lesson she has taught him so far. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re a team. If you aren\u2019t confident in an area of healing, you reach out to one of your fellow healers. None of us can save the galaxy on our own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Obi-Wan nods as he processes this. \u201cWhat should I start studying, then? What area are we weakest?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still twelve,\u201d Vokara reminds him. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re gaining a broad overview of everything. You won\u2019t begin to specialize until sixteen. When your counterparts will become senior padawans and begin leaving the Temple more often, you\u2019ll start your specialization. And don\u2019t try to jump ahead. Keep an open mind. The Force will guide you when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan frowns, dissatisfied with the answer, but he doesn\u2019t argue.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me a sterile room!\u201d Vokara shouts. Her voice cuts through the Halls and immediately there is a wave of motion. Healers and apprentices scatter to attend to their own patients or prep a room for Vokara\u2019s.</p>\n<p>When Vokara received a comm telling her to meet an injured Jedi at the hangar, she didn\u2019t expect <em>this</em>. She will have to remind Qui-Gon Jinn that while the Council may find his scattered reports amusing, <em>she</em> does not.</p>\n<p>The Jedi Master in question is practically on Vokara\u2019s heels as she uses the Force to hold Master Tahl still and carry her into a private room. When Vokara lowers Master Tahl onto the med-bed, Qui-Gon hovers, his anxiety and worry pouring off him in waves. </p>\n<p>\u201cOut,\u201d Vokara says. On the bed, her patient trembles as her body fights against the hold the Force has on her. Vokara snaps her fingers and holds her hand out. Obi-Wan places her scanner on her palm. Vokara shifts to start her scan and knocks into a body that is not supposed to be in her way.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut,\u201d Vokara repeats. She doesn\u2019t take her gaze off her patient, because she can\u2019t afford to. But if she has to repeat herself a third time\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cShe needs me,\u201d Qui-Gon says. His grief and his guilt pour off of him. It\u2019s enough to give Vokara a headache. If she feels as if she\u2019s swallowing Qui-Gon\u2019s emotions, then Tahl must have it even worse. </p>\n<p>\u201cQui-Gon, come with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Vokara recognizes Mace\u2019s voice so she stops sparing any of her attention to that mess. Instead, she returns her full focus to Tahl. She doesn\u2019t have to ask before she feels Obi-Wan\u2019s presence in her mind. He\u2019s learned how to make himself quiet, almost invisible while he observes.</p>\n<p>Often, he\u2019ll ask questions and they\u2019ll discuss Vokara\u2019s patients, but today he is silent. Vokara does a scan with her medical scanner while a droid does a second. The readouts aren\u2019t positive. It\u2019s a riot of symptoms, too many for the scanner to process. Which means this will require a more hands-on approach.</p>\n<p>Vokara takes a deep breath and then closes her eyes so she can look with the Force. Tahl\u2019s aura is stained. Red like blood, green-yellow like the edge of a bruise, and then the black tendrils which spread in every direction. </p>\n<p>Poison. </p>\n<p>The black has deep roots, and it feeds off the other colors. She needs to address those first. Tahl\u2019s aura should be light blue, almost white like the surface of a lake on a clear day. Vokara finds Tahl\u2019s lungs first and starts purging her aura of the poison. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a slow, draining fight, but it\u2019s the one Vokara has spent her life training for. She clears Tahl\u2019s lungs and then her heart. She moves to Tahl\u2019s throat next. Bit by bit the red is drained away and the green-yellow is pushed back. </p>\n<p>Vokara exists in two worlds, the physical and the metaphysical. In the physical world, her body sways, exhausted. Even though her eyes are closed, she can see spots. A headache builds. She should take a break, rest, and resume once she\u2019s recharged. </p>\n<p>A fresh look at Tahl\u2019s aura shows the black spreading more now that it has the space. Tahl will die if Vokara can\u2019t stop this. </p>\n<p>And if Vokara pushes herself until she collapses? </p>\n<p><em>Here.</em> Obi-Wan offers a well of power for Vokara to draw from. Obi-Wan has made tremendous progress since becoming her padawan, but he can\u2019t heal Tahl. What he can do, however, is offer his own reserves for Vokara to use. </p>\n<p><em>Thank you.</em> Vokara taps into Obi-Wan\u2019s power. It\u2019s crisp and refreshing, like a dip in the pool. It\u2019s like drinking a shot of espresso. The world is sharper, she feels brighter. She takes a steadying breath and fights again for Tahl\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It takes three days of Vokara and Obi-Wan working in tandem to burn the poison from Tahl\u2019s system. Vokara leaves the rest of Tahl\u2019s injuries to her very capable staff and then falls into bed with her padawan at her side. </p>\n<p>They sleep for almost an entire day and then there\u2019s the long, blurred process of becoming sentient again. Vokara starts with a shower and then clean, simple clothes and then food. She has enough wherewithal to set her padawan through the same process. </p>\n<p>She is exhausted, an uncomfortable weight in her limbs and dark circles under her eyes, but she\u2019ll recover.</p>\n<p>Even better, Tahl will as well.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan watches Healer Drovan attend to Tahl with the help of two droids. Vokara sips her caf, her third cup already, and braces herself for the inevitable questions. Obi-Wan will have a dozen at least, and he deserves answers to them. Force healing is an art and one they haven\u2019t practiced often together. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe came from Melida/Daan,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t the opening Vokara expects. </p>\n<p>\u201cMission reports are available in the Archives,\u201d Obi-Wan tells Vokara.</p>\n<p>Vokara makes a note to have a conversation with Jocasta about enabling her padawan. If Jocasta wanted Obi-Wan as a future archivist, Jocasta could have made an offer. </p>\n<p>\u201cI was curious.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s voice dips as if he senses the change in Vokara\u2019s mood. And then he straightens his shoulders as if preparing for an argument. \u201cThere\u2019s a war on Melida/Daan. Master Tahl was captured and hurt. We were barely able to help her with all the resources the Temple has.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we did help her,\u201d Vokara says. </p>\n<p>\u201cMelida/Daan doesn\u2019t have a Jedi Temple,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cWhere will their injured go? Who will help them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Vokara knows Jedi are encouraged to take padawans to keep them humble. Yes, it is her role to teach her padawan, but it is her duty to learn from her padawan in turn. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cMelida/Daan needs help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we can help them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can. I\u2019m going to speak with the Council. I want you to go to the Archives and ask Archivist Nu for assistance with a Republic Relief Request.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan bobs his head and then trots off to carry out his mission. Vokara finishes her caf and then pours herself a fresh cup. She\u2019ll need it for this upcoming fight with the Council.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Vokara, Obi-Wan, Master Tivok, his padawan Cuit and Knight Tristane are the Jedi assigned to the Melida/Daan case. Vokara and Obi-Wan will work with the Republic Relief team to supply and tend to the war refugees while the other Jedi are tasked with bringing the war to its end. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan spends the flight to Melida/Daan sleeping or learning everything he can from the Republic Relief workers. Vokara leaves him to it. She sleeps as much as she can to bolster her energy and her reserves before they hit the ground. </p>\n<p>Due to Tahl\u2019s report, they avoid the major city and spaceport. Knowing they would likely not have a place to land, they took a ship which could handle being parked outside a hangar. They land in an open space once they determine it isn\u2019t a field or a farm or any kind of necessary land. </p>\n<p>The copilot reported signs of a settlement about ten klicks away. There is a brief discussion of who would go with what supplies. It\u2019s eventually decided that Knight Tristane will act as escort for Vokara and Obi-Wan and a small number of the relief workers. They\u2019ll do an initial check and, if the settlement is safe, the rest of them will join and begin their work.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re two kliks out when a warning shot stops them where they are.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn around!\u201d a voice calls out. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe have food,\u201d Vokara tells them. \u201cAnd medical supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cElders aren\u2019t welcome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Vokara can respond, Obi-Wan steps forward. Despite almost a year in her care, Obi-Wan is on the small size for one his age and species, as if he believes his body takes up more space than it should. His padawan braid is still barely more than a stub, and while his robes are simple and clean, they don\u2019t give him any kind of imitation factor.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan steps forward, his hands raised in a gesture of peace, and all Vokara can think is how young he looks. This child she chose, the one she swore to protect. He\u2019s small, but he\u2019s an easy target for anyone with good aim. Her instincts scream at her to reach for him and pull him back, but the Force cautions her against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not an Elder,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed,\u201d the voice finally says. \u201cOnly you. Bring your offering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t harm my companions?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help. I won\u2019t see more bodies added to the count.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey can return to where they came from,\u201d the voice says. \u201cIf they don\u2019t attack us, we won\u2019t attack them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>All Vokara can do now is trust.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Vokara sees through Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes. Their bond is strong, stronger than most masters and padawans, but healers always have a strong connection. They are inside each other\u2019s minds daily for training, and it builds a bridge which is easily crossed.</p>\n<p>She almost wishes the distance was enough to lessen their bond. Even after all her years as a healer in the field and a healer at the Temple, it hurts to see this community of children. They\u2019re injured, sick, and half-starved. None of them have the strength to fight an enemy beyond their walls let alone the battle inside their bodies. </p>\n<p>Vokara watches as Obi-Wan runs himself ragged trying to help as many as he can. But even with the medical supplies he brought and the support of the Force, he is only one person. His tears are hers when the first child passes into the Force. His grief is hers and it feels as if it\u2019s ripping her apart. His screams are hers and her throat is sore for an entire day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you said you could help!\u201d The voice, Vokara now knows it belongs to a teenager named Mawat, is angry. The boy grabs Obi-Wan by the shoulders and shakes him. \u201cWhat good are you? They\u2019re still dying!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, they are!\u201d Obi-Wan is tired, not only physically but his soul as well. Vokara feels more of his energy drained with every moment, but there isn\u2019t anything she can do, stuck here on the transport while they wait to be allowed to help. </p>\n<p>But beneath the exhaustion is anger, and as Obi-Wan taps into it he finds a new rush of energy. He shoves Mawat away from him. \u201cI have medicine, but I\u2019m only one person. I can only help those I can help. And I <em>have.</em> The ones who are dying? Their deaths are on you, because there are those who can help, and you refuse to let them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re Elders!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Obi-Wan says and his voice is hardened by anger but also by determination. \u201cThe Melida, the Daan, they are Elders. You don\u2019t trust them, and you have no reason to. But the people who came with me, they\u2019re <em>my</em> people. They can be trusted. They can help. You just have to let them in.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s voice drops to a near-whisper. \u201cThere\u2019s more food. There\u2019s more supplies. Please, Mawat. Let me contact them. Let them help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan holds his breath and so Vokara holds her as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Mawat says. \u201cTell them to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Even with the relief workers and five Jedi, they can\u2019t save everyone. Vokara knows Obi-Wan commits each name to memory. She knows he goes with Cerasi and Nield, the leaders of the war effort, to place the bodies at the memorials. She wonders if she should stop him from doing it or if it\u2019s a necessary closure.</p>\n<p>It has been a long time since Vokara had a padawan. She forgot how difficult it is. She\u2019s raised two, and Obi-Wan is her third. But she doesn\u2019t have all the answers. And she worries over the consequences of her choices. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t save everyone,\u201d Obi-Wan tells her, after one of his trips to the monuments. \u201cBut we can honor them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vokara indulges in a rare show of sentimentality, and she leans down until she can press a kiss to Obi-Wan\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>There are negotiations and battles, but those happen in the background. Vokara\u2019s life, Obi-Wan\u2019s life, isn\u2019t about fighting for the planet. They\u2019re about fighting for a single life, one at a time. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan learns field medicine and Force healing. He learns when to swear and when to pray and when to walk to the edge of the encampment and scream. He learns how incredible his abilities are and he learns their limitations. </p>\n<p>If Vokara had known they were entering a warzone with child soldiers, she isn\u2019t sure she would have let Obi-Wan accompany her. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>When the war finally ends, there are cheers and celebrations, but Vokara doesn\u2019t indulge, because the war is over, but her work isn\u2019t. Obi-Wan remains at her side, and they heal those they can, and ease the pain of those who are returned to the Force. </p>\n<p>Before they leave the planet, Vokara goes to one of the monuments with Obi-Wan and the new leaders of Melidaan, Cerasi and Nield. The two were children of leaders of the opposing factions. They found each other on the street one day and decided they would break the cycle of violence and revenge. They would not follow in the paths of their parents and their families and their faction. They would do something new.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one remembers how the war began,\u201d Cerasi says as she stares at the slab of stone with the names of everyone lost. There are names missing from the stone and still it\u2019s too long. \u201cBut everyone will know how it ended.\u201d</p>\n<p>She joins Nield and leans into his side as they stare at the stone. Vokara stands behind Obi-Wan and rests her hand on his shoulder. His emotions are jumbled, as she\u2019d expect them to be. This list of names, it is a recording of lives lost. Many of them before Vokara and Obi-Wan arrived but there are ones lost while they were here.</p>\n<p>Guilt and shame are strong amongst Obi-Wan\u2019s feelings, as if this monument is a condemnation. Vokara squeezes his shoulder. <em>We can only do what we can do, padawan.</em></p>\n<p><em>I know,</em> Obi-Wan says and she can feel the truth in his words. It doesn\u2019t lessen the ache in his chest. They did everything they could, and it wasn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a mindset many healers begin with. Those who can\u2019t shake it burn out or drop out. </p>\n<p>Vokara has learned to live with the knowledge that there will always be those she can\u2019t help. She will do what she can, and she will celebrate those lives saved. She will, quietly, mourn those she couldn\u2019t save, and then she will move on. No monuments, no litanies. If she remembered, she wouldn\u2019t rise from her bed in the mornings.</p>\n<p><em>We all learn our own ways of coping,</em> Vokara tells Obi-Wan. She will share with him what she does. Maybe, it will help him. Maybe, it won\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go home,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Vokara says. And then, tucked safely behind her shields, where Obi-Wan won\u2019t hear, she thinks that she is quite ready to stay home. There will be plenty of opportunity for Obi-Wan to see war and death and suffering in his life. </p>\n<p>If she has her way, and she nearly always does, they won\u2019t leave the Temple again until he\u2019s a senior padawan.</p>\n<p>Mace Windu knows the Jedi Order isn\u2019t infallible. In some ways, he knows this more than anyone else. Seeing shatterpoints means he knows people and choices can have far reaching impacts on the galaxy, no matter how average a person appears or how simple a choice is.</p>\n<p>Knowing there are flaws within the Order doesn\u2019t mean he knows the best way to address them. Just as knowing a moment is significant doesn\u2019t mean he knows how or why or which choice should be made. </p>\n<p>The Force has always been chaotic around Obi-Wan Kenobi, but the Force is chaotic around most beings. There are thousands of futures tied into every being. If Mace stops for a croissant before going to the Senate, will he delay his trip and miss a speeder accident? If he stops for a croissant, will he delay his trip and get <em>into</em> a speeder accident? </p>\n<p>The possibilities are endless and impossible to quantify. He cannot chase every way the galaxy might shift, or he will go mad. He has to listen when the Force is particularly insistent and do the best he can. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what the future of galaxy would have been if Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to the AgriCorps. He isn\u2019t even certain what the future of the galaxy will be now that Obi-Wan is still with the Temple. He has to trust that it\u2019s better. And, because the future is not fixed, because it is always in motion, he must do what he can to continue to improve the galaxy\u2019s future.</p>\n<p>Today, Mace takes a much smaller view. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi finishes his warm-up. He was aware of Mace\u2019s presence, because he looked over when Mace first entered, but now he gives Mace his full attention. \u201cIs there something I can assist you with, Councilor?\u201d </p>\n<p>Polite and composed, Obi-Wan Kenobi could have easily been a diplomat. Endless possibilities, Mace reminds himself, and then he focuses on the present. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you in the salles and with the battle master, Padawan Kenobi. Your Soresu is impressive.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s more than impressive, and Mace can see how it will only become better as Obi-Wan ages and continues to practice. Soresu is known at the defensive form. There are those who scoff at it, because it isn\u2019t a direct attack, but there is a strength many overlook in the form. Soresu doesn\u2019t wear down an opponent with flashy or powerful moves. It wears them down by refusing to yield.</p>\n<p>A master of Soresu is a master of themselves. They are a fixed point that weathers an unrelenting storm. And once the storm wears itself out, the master remains. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan hasn\u2019t achieved mastery of the form, but the glimpses of it are there. Already, he can stand against any padawan or senior padawan at the Temple and hold his own. He waits and waits and waits and then, once they\u2019re tired, he ends the spar.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have the endurance yet to defeat many knights or any of the masters, but he\u2019s still quite young. Mace has watched Obi-Wan\u2019s progress at Vokara\u2019s request and now, again at her request, he has an offer to make. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Obi-Wan says. Again, the polite smile, even a bow to acknowledge Mace\u2019s words, but he doesn\u2019t believe it. He holds himself back as if waiting for the follow-up.</p>\n<p>Vokara was right. The Order has harmed this child. Mace only hopes they can also help heal him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Che has asked me to supplement your Soresu training with Shien.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForm Five?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cShien is known for its transitions, from defense to offense and back again. As a healer, your dedication to defense is understandable, but there will be circumstances where being able to employ a quick, pointed attack will be useful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I need to reach a patient,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cOr if our healing station is attacked. We begin with katas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe begin with a demonstration,\u201d Mace says. He hangs his robes on a hook and then ignites his saber. The purple blade sets him apart from most Jedi. There are some who judge him for it and some who treat him as a danger and others who see him as special or Force-blessed. He always wants to laugh and tell them it\u2019s a damn crystal color. It isn\u2019t a sign or a warning. It just is.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t show off, but he does show, moving from Soresu to Shien and back. He can feel Obi-Wan\u2019s gaze on him, curious and attentive, and when Mace finishes, Obi-Wan nods, seemingly to himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cWill you show me the first kata?\u201d </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t complain when Mace has him do basic katas over and over again. He doesn\u2019t protest when Mace has Obi-Wan teach in addition to learn. He accepts each decision Mace makes and then applies himself to the task. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s making good progress,\u201d Mace tells Vokara during what has become a standing weekly meeting between the two of them. They will sometimes venture out of the Temple to stop at a cantina or a caf\u00e9, but they always end in one of their quarters to speak freely while they enjoy their procured victuals. </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, he is.\u201d Vokara scoffs as if she isn\u2019t sure why Mace feels the need to tell her something she already knows. \u201cHave you told Obi-Wan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs often as I feel I can,\u201d Mace answers. He hums quietly and stirs his drink to keep the flavor from sinking to the bottom. \u201cHe is suspicious of praise. At times, he believes it\u2019s a lie. At others, he believes it\u2019s a set-up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do our initiates a disservice with the way we handle the Corps,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cWe raise them to believe they\u2019ll be knights or failures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to push for a change within the Order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAstute,\u201d Vokara says.</p>\n<p>The Jedi Order adheres to tradition, and Mace knows there are benefits to such a long, rich history. But one of those benefits is to learn from it. They are becoming stagnant. And if they do not continue to grow, they will fall behind or become obsolete. </p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you have some suggestions?\u201d Mace asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Vokara gives Mace an arch look. \u201cI suppose you want me to do all the work for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace laughs and then takes a sip of his drink. \u201cI appreciate any assistance you wish to give.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Every month the Temple hosts a friendly competition for anyone who wishes to participate. It\u2019s a lightsaber tournament, and it pits knights against senior padawans and senior padawans against masters. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s an opportunity to socialize and make a few friendly wagers. </p>\n<p>Mace doesn\u2019t participate in this one, but he joins some of the other Jedi in one of the observation rooms. Vokara is here, a drink already in hand, and she shakes her head at whatever Tholme has just told her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m off-duty. I\u2019m here as a spectator, not a healer.\u201d Vokara smiles when she spots Mace and waves him over.</p>\n<p>He makes his way through his colleagues, nodding in greeting to some, verbally greeting others. He reaches Vokara and Tholme. \u201cHow do the brackets look today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t already reviewed them?\u201d Tholme asks. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t betting, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMace isn\u2019t betting?\u201d Jocasta Nu joins them with a drink in each hand. She keeps the fizzing green one for herself and hands Mace the purple one with a little smile crinkling her eyes. \u201cNo faith in Obi-Wan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have plenty of faith in Obi-Wan,\u201d Mace says. Even though Obi-Wan is in the salles itself, out of earshot of the gossips above, he worries the boy might somehow overhear. \u201cWho are his opponents?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis only opponent is Padawan Muln,\u201d Jocasta says. \u201cThe rest are potential opponents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace doesn\u2019t roll his eyes, only because he\u2019s too well-trained. He does sip his drink. It\u2019s sweet, fruity, with a bit of a kick which means someone\u2019s been distilling their own liquor in the Archives again. He gives Jocasta an arch look.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, lighten up, Mace,\u201d she says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs Padawan Vos participating?\u201d Vokara asks Tholme, no doubt trying to head off Mace and Jocasta\u2019s bickering before they can get going. Mace is almost certain Jocasta Nu spends her time in the Archives coming up with ways to annoy him during Council meetings.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is. He has a few new moves he wants to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould we be concerned?\u201d Mace asks. Things catch on fire at an alarming rate when Quinlan Vos decides to be creative. Not to mention, Mace is all but convinced Vos is behind the protocol droids gaining a language upgrade which taught them how to curse. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo need for concern,\u201d Tholme says. \u201cQuinlan\u2019s calmed down these past few years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace isn\u2019t the only one to give Tholme an incredulous look.</p>\n<p>\u201cPadawan Vos has an apprentice healer for a friend,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cHe causes trouble and Obi-Wan helps him clean it up. It\u2019s good training so I haven\u2019t discouraged it. My guess, by the time Obi-Wan is ready to be knighted, quarter credit will go to Vos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit generous, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Thomle asks.</p>\n<p>On the salles floor, Padawan Vos gives a Devaronian war cry and then launches into an aggressive attack against his first opponent. Two minutes into the fight, Knight Solar has tossed Padawan Vos\u2019s lightsaber aside and Padawan Vos has resorted to leaping on Knight Solar\u2019s back to tackle him to the ground.</p>\n<p>Tholme sighs but lurking beneath the exasperation is a bit of pride.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The observation room has windows into each of the four salles being used for the tournament. Mace still hasn\u2019t finished his first drink by the time Obi-Wan wins his first bout. It was a standard fight, padawan against padawan, and the two are friends so while it was competitive, there was no edge to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that Shien I saw Padawan Kenobi using?\u201d Tholme asks. \u201cYou\u2019ve taught him well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve taught him,\u201d Mace corrects. \u201cHe learned well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll place a wager on him. Oh.\u201d Tholme\u2019s voice dips, disappointed. \u201cUnlucky second draw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace looks at the updated brackets and sees what Tholme must have seen. Obi-Wan\u2019s next opponent is Yan Dooku. The older master isn\u2019t in the Temple often these days. He\u2019s kept his distance since Galidraan. Personally, Mace thinks Yoda should spend more time bringing his lineage together and less time adding to it, but he keeps those thoughts to himself.</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s good to see Yan in the Temple. </p>\n<p>There are several murmurs of sympathy directed at Vokara as her padawan prepares to face off against a venerated Jedi master and skilled duelist. For his part, Obi-Wan shows no outward signs of distress. He wipes the sweat from his forehead, takes another drink from his water bottle, and then picks his saber up off the bench he left it on. </p>\n<p>Mace isn\u2019t surprised when Obi-Wan falls into a Soresu stance after bowing to Yan. While Obi-Wan\u2019s Shien has improved greatly, it\u2019s no match for Yan\u2019s Makashi. Mace isn\u2019t sure Soresu will fare much better, but it\u2019s Obi-Wan\u2019s first form and the one he\u2019s most comfortable in.</p>\n<p>Vokara hums softly as she stands next to Mace. \u201cThis will be good for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace, busy watching, doesn\u2019t ask her which him she refers to.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Mace and Vokara are two of the only Jedi to have watched Obi-Wan and Yan\u2019s bout for its entirety. Given that they\u2019re entering their second hour, it isn\u2019t too shocking. </p>\n<p>The duel began the way Mace expected. Obi-Wan was steady in his defense, and Yan probed his guard for weaknesses, but didn\u2019t bring a full-on attack. It\u2019s a sign of respect from masters to padawans to not end the fight in the first few minutes. But what began as a training exercise has become something else entirely.</p>\n<p>Yan has attacked with speed, he has attacked with grace, and he has attacked with frustration. Obi-Wan has remained steady through it all. He matches Yan\u2019s speed, his skill, his power with an infallible defense.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan parries, he guards, he meets each attack with the exact amount of energy it requires and no more. He stands his ground when he needs to, and he cedes it when it\u2019s advantageous. </p>\n<p>While both padawan and master have sweated through their clothes, Obi-Wan\u2019s expression is far more serene than Yan\u2019s. The boy seems <em>relaxed</em> as he holds his own against one of the Order\u2019s most talented duelists. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, to be young again.\u201d Master Vito joins Mace and Vokara. He\u2019s an elderly Bothan and last year he was taken off the active mission roster. He still shares his knowledge through teaching courses and spending time in the creche. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t youth,\u201d Vokara says. \u201cObi-Wan doesn\u2019t have raw power, but he has this.\u201d She inclines her head as if they aren\u2019t also watching Obi-Wan as he twists away from Yan\u2019s latest attack. Obi-Wan\u2019s saber crackles against Yan\u2019s as he fends off a strike. </p>\n<p>When the two part, it\u2019s Yan who looks frustrated.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It takes four hours for the duel to end. The rest of the bouts have finished, and a winner has been named despite the second-round fight still taking place. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s Yan who wins the fight, after he slips through Obi-Wan\u2019s guard in a rare moment of weakness. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be proud,\u201d Mace tells Vokara, because Obi-Wan did far better than Mace would have expected for his age and experience.</p>\n<p>Vokara doesn\u2019t smile or even try to hide a pleased reaction. She looks troubled as Obi-Wan is swarmed by his friends. Padawan Vos claps him hard enough on the back to knock him over and Padawan Muln catches him before he falls. Padawan Eerin fusses and holds out both a water bottle and a strip of jerky. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey say the Force provides,\u201d Vokara says.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only the two of them on this side of the observation room. They\u2019re some of the few Jedi remaining now that the main event and side event are over. </p>\n<p>\u201cSome say the Force doesn\u2019t ask for more than we can give,\u201d Vokara continues.</p>\n<p>Mace waits, patient for the conclusion she\u2019s leading them both to.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does the galaxy hold that my padawan needs that kind of endurance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace looks down at Obi-Wan. The boy laughs as he dumps half his water over his head to cool off. His face is flushed, and he now drips with both water and sweat. He\u2019s tired but he isn\u2019t exhausted. </p>\n<p>Around him, the Force swells and recedes. There are a thousand futures all vying for their opportunity. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be proud,\u201d Mace repeats.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan ducks around a corner and curses under his breath as the blaster bolt meant for him hits the building instead. He doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to catch his breath, because the shooter isn\u2019t content with a close call.</p>\n<p>He sprints down the road and then slips into a shop.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper urges him toward a trap door. Obi-Wan hesitates long enough for the Force to warn him if needed and, when it\u2019s quiet, he drops into the cellar. By the time his pursuer is in the shop, their boots heavy on the wooden floor, the trap door is closed, and the rug has been rolled over it. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan sits in the dark and breathes slowly. He twists his padawan braid around his finger, a nervous habit he hasn\u2019t quite shaken. The bead at the end helps settle him. It\u2019s his Senior Padawan bead. Healer Che gave it to him only a few months ago. </p>\n<p>And now he\u2019s here, on his first mission since. </p>\n<p>When the trap door opens again, it\u2019s the shopkeeper who waves at him.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan climbs up the ladder. \u201cVor entye,\u201d Obi-Wan says, thanking the shopkeeper. </p>\n<p>They smile, probably at his accent which isn\u2019t as smooth as it could be. \u201cWhat did you do to have them after you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Them, being members of Death Watch or Kyr\u2019tsad as they\u2019re called in Mando\u2019a. Obi-Wan and Garen were both sent to Mandalore at the same time. They were even both sent to Keldabe. But where Garen and his master were sent to protect Duchess Satine Kryze, Obi-Wan\u2019s been tasked with the civilians who are under threat from the terrorist sect. </p>\n<p>Those who aren\u2019t chasing Garen and Satine across the Mandalore system are trying to rule Keldabe with fear. They don\u2019t appreciate Obi-Wan\u2019s efforts to keep hope and resistance alive. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cWith the attacks, I\u2019m running low on supplies, and they have plenty lying around.\u201d Speaking of, he opens his satchel. \u201cIs there anything you or your family need?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAliit,\u201d the shopkeeper says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAliit?\u201d Obi-Wan repeats. He scans his satchel. It\u2019s basic foodstuffs and medical supplies. His Mando\u2019a isn\u2019t great. The shopkeeper could be asking for anything. </p>\n<p>\u201cFamily,\u201d the shopkeeper says. \u201cClan. Aliit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Do you have any children?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAde,\u201d the shopkeepers says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAde.\u201d Obi-Wan commits the word to memory. \u201cDo you have any?\u201d</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper smiles. \u201cThree.\u201d Their smile dims. \u201cThe curfew is hard on them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan takes three sweets from his satchel. Kyr\u2019tsad didn\u2019t have any lollipops that he saw, but this is close enough. He places the candy on the table. \u201cIf you need my services, there are those in Keldabe who know how to signal me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBaar\u2019ur,\u201d the shopkeeper says. <em>Medic</em>.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan smiles. He knows that one. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan aims his blaster and returns fire. He hears a curse as he hits his target. He shoots again, twice in quick succession. He hits his target but there are no more curses. He swallows back his reservations and his guilt and takes aim again.</p>\n<p>Behind him, he hears the shouts and movement of their covert as they scramble to take as many supplies as they can. He doesn\u2019t know if it was poor luck or betrayal which led to Kyr\u2019tsad to their hideout, but it isn\u2019t hidden or safe anymore.</p>\n<p>The wounded have already been moved. Now, it\u2019s time for the supplies. As one of the uninjured, Obi-Wan helps hold Kyr\u2019tsad off as the others clear the area. </p>\n<p>Next to him, Jingko lobs a grenade. It lands and smoke pours out. A second grenade lands. There\u2019s a blinding flash, and Jingko scolds Obi-Wan for looking, even as he grabs Obi-Wan\u2019s sleeve and hauls him away from his perch.</p>\n<p>Blaster fire follows them deeper into the building. Obi-Wan swears as a bolt glances off his shoulder. It isn\u2019t a direct hit, but it burns. He stumbles and then shakes off Jingko\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>He follows Jingko down lower. Keldabe has plenty of flat rooftops, but Obi-Wan learned early on that going up is never the first choice. The enemy has jetpacks. Street level with tight corners and tight quarters is good. Below ground is even better. </p>\n<p>When Kyr\u2019tsad set off their attacks in the capital city, they expected to kill or capture the Kryze family. Both Satine and her sister made it out. With part of their forces sent to track them down, the rest of Kyr\u2019tsad stayed to take the city and claim leadership for themselves. </p>\n<p>What began as an aid mission has turned into something more. Obi-Wan is part of the underground resistance. If Kyr\u2019tsad thought Keldabe would crumble under a bit of pressure, they don\u2019t deserve to rule Mandalore. How can someone rule people they don\u2019t understand?</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan had been briefed on the New Mandalorians and the Kyr\u2019tsad before coming here. He didn\u2019t realize until he fell in with the resistance that in order to have New Mandalorians, there must have been Old Mandalorians. </p>\n<p>They call themselves the Haat Mando\u2019ade. They don\u2019t embrace the violence or terror of Kyr\u2019tsad, but they don\u2019t adhere to the New Mandalorian peaceful philosophy. They believe in fighting, not to claim or conquer but to protect what\u2019s theirs. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan fits in with them better than he thought he would.</p>\n<p>He and Jingko shake their tail before they finally take the path to the new base. It\u2019s in the basement of a building which has seen better days. Its construction is half the original wood and half modern durasteel. </p>\n<p>The lights are kept low, enough to see but not enough to attract attention. </p>\n<p>\u201cBaar\u2019ur?\u201d someone calls when he\u2019s spotted. \u201cWe need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan hasn\u2019t gone by his name since he fell in with the resistance. Names are dangerous. Baar\u2019ur is a title, but it\u2019s also what he is, and he answers to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee to yourself first,\u201d Jingko says. He grabs Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder before Obi-Wan is out of reach. Jingko\u2019s fingers dig into the blaster burn, and Obi-Wan hisses. \u201cYourself first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan mutters something unkind in Mando\u2019a, but he applies a bit of healing salve to the burn. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou need armor,\u201d Jingko says as Obi-Wan crouches down next to Inara, a youngling who lost her parents in the initial attack. Her physical injuries have healed, but she needs help settling every time they have to move their base. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt protects you so you can protect us,\u201d Inara says.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan glares at Jingko in lieu of the cutting remark he was going to make. Obi-Wan turns back to Inara and offers her a soft smile. \u201cWe can discuss it.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan compromises, because even if he isn\u2019t on the diplomat track at the Temple, he\u2019s taken enough lessons to know how to politely concede ground. He doesn\u2019t wear a full set of armor, because he needs mobility more than he needs the protection, but he does accumulate a few pieces. Vambraces, a cuirass, shoulder bells, and thigh plates. He\u2019s certain they would give him more if he would agree.</p>\n<p>No, not give.</p>\n<p>He earned his armor.</p>\n<p>And this is where Obi-Wan\u2019s true reluctance comes in. He knows enough about Mandalorian culture now to know what their armor means to them. Their armor resonates with their soul like a Jedi\u2019s kyber crystal resonates with a Jedi\u2019s soul. </p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t Mandalorian. To wear beskar means something to them that it doesn\u2019t mean to him. It can\u2019t mean to him. He is Senior Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Jedi Order. But he traces his fingers over the sleek metal, and he feels it hum back at him. There is something here that speaks to him. That tempts him. Is this supposed to be a test? It\u2019s too early for his Trials, he was only just named a senior padawan, but he can\u2019t help but wonder.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan is grateful for his armor when a building collapses and shrapnel flies in every direction. A chunk of duracrete slams into his chest and knocks him on his ass. His chest aches, but he can pull in a full breath. </p>\n<p>He curses as blaster fire follows the collapse. He scoops a child up off the ground and runs. Blaster bolts hit his back, but they\u2019re stopped by his backplate. Each hit is as solid as a punch, but he doesn\u2019t buckle. He uses the Force to direct the bolts away from his unprotected areas. The shots fizzle out on the ground around him or they beat on his armor.</p>\n<p>When he makes it to the safehouse, there\u2019s a standoff between a fully armored Mandalorian and the others. Behind the Mandalorian are adults in need of medical attention and care. They are bruised and cut up and some of them cradle their limbs as if part of the building had fallen on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cElissa!\u201d One of the adults holds their arms out and the child Obi-Wan brought wiggles out of Obi-Wan\u2019s hold and rushes to the adult.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan grabs his satchel, and then he scans the adults until he finds the one in need of the most immediate attention. They have a long gash on their head, and the blood has soaked into their hair. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are here now, and there is help,\u201d Obi-Wan tells them. </p>\n<p>As he cleans the wound, Jingko and the armored Mandalorian finally speak. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow can we trust you?\u201d Jingko asks. \u201cYou were with Kyr\u2019tsad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot by choice,\u201d the Mandalorian says. Their vocorder flattens their voice. \u201cThey complained about the resistance movement, enough that I knew you were real. And when I saw you today, I took my chance to leave. I\u2019m not Kyr\u2019tsad. I\u2019m not New Mandalorian either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jingko asks.</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian removes their helmet. There are gasps throughout the room, but Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t recognize the Mandalorian\u2019s features. They have blond hair, close-cropped to fit under their helmet. Their eyes are sharp and intelligent, and they scan the room for threats as they converse. </p>\n<p>When they smile, there\u2019s something dangerous at the edges. \u201cI am Arla, Clan Fett, House Mereel.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Oh</em>, Obi-Wan thinks as he applies a bit of salve to the headwound. It slows the bleeding enough for him to put in the stitches which will hold it together as it heals. He\u2019s heard of both Clan Fett and House Mereel. Jaster Mereel was the Mand\u2019alor, the leader until he was betrayed by one of his men and killed. </p>\n<p>And Jango Fett was his heir, who led the True Mandalorians until Galidraan. According to the Archives, Jango Fett killed five Jedi with his bare hands before he was subdued. And then the Jedi turned him over to Kyr\u2019tsad. It was a shameful moment in a long string of them at Galidraan. As far as Obi-Wan knows, Jango Fett is dead or as good as. </p>\n<p>But there\u2019s another Fett alive? Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t have a strong grasp on Mandalorians and their familial or political ties. Does this make Arla the successor of the True Mandalorians? </p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents gave refuge to Jaster Mereel and his super commandos,\u201d Arla says. \u201cKyr\u2019tsad followed. They killed my parents and burned our farm. Jaster managed to get my brother out. Kyr\u2019tsad took me. But I\u2019m free now, and I\u2019m ready to see them burn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan places a bandage on the stitches he did and then moves to his next patient.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Jingko says and the room seems to breathe easier.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are useful,\u201d Arla says. She sits next to Obi-Wan, but he doesn\u2019t miss the way her body is coiled, ready to spring into action, or that she has her hand resting on her blaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do my best,\u201d Obi-Wan says. He stands beside one of the med-beds. Its occupant has a cracked rib and has been ordered to remain on strict bedrest. Whenever Obi-Wan has the time, and energy, to spare, he speeds the healing with the Force.</p>\n<p>Today, he doesn\u2019t have the energy, but he sits at his patient\u2019s side and holds their hand. He has three weapons in reach, not counting his own body or the Force. Arla still puts him on edge. She looks at him as if she\u2019s doing a threat analysis, and he isn\u2019t sure how much time he\u2019ll have to react if she decides he is one.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard bits and pieces of her past. How she started with Kyr\u2019tsad as a hostage, turned into a prisoner, and then into a member on probation. She hasn\u2019t had an easy or gentle life. He wonders how much she knows about her brother\u2019s fate. The way her gaze narrows on his padawan braid suggests she knows enough. </p>\n<p>The Jedi acted rashly on Galidraan and no amount of apologies or reparations will be able to undo what was done. Arla\u2019s armor is red to honor Jaster and gold to promise vengeance. For him? For her brother? For the True Mandalorians?</p>\n<p>\u201cThey accept you.\u201d Arla\u2019s gaze drops to his vambraces.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan has grown used to wearing the armor. It doesn\u2019t feel odd anymore. He\u2019s worn it often enough and trained enough in it that he\u2019s comfortable fighting in it. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he says and it isn\u2019t an accusation, simply a statement of fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beskar,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>earned</em>, not given. They say you earned it. That should be enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan waits, patiently, for her to sort through her thoughts.</p>\n<p>She studies his braid again. \u201cThat is too obvious.\u201d She produces a thin metal wire from one of her many pockets and holds it out. \u201cUse this to hide it. Or cut it.\u201d She shrugs as if she doesn\u2019t care which he chooses. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to the strategy meeting?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. He doesn\u2019t attend because he\u2019s an outsider, because he\u2019s a baar\u2019ur, not a fighter. But it\u2019s obvious Arla is a rallying figure. Her connections, her survival, they\u2019re both admired and respected. At her curt nod, Obi-Wan says, \u201cWe could use more medical supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could use a base,\u201d she says and then pushes off her chair and leaves.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the first time Obi-Wan has done his own braid. He prefers it when Healer Che does it, but it isn\u2019t an option. He braids his strands of hair around the wire; master, padawan, the Force, and beskar all woven together in harmony. When he finishes, he uses the wire to twist his braid up so it\u2019s hidden by the rest of his hair.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>With Arla leading them, the resistance becomes more than a team doing their best to react to Kyr\u2019tsad\u2019s attacks. They launch their own in response. Within months, Keldabe is under control of the True Mandalorians, and they are operating out of Keldabe\u2019s Great Hall. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan has an entire medbay to call his own. He has supplies with the ability to requisition more. He has instruments and droids, and it isn\u2019t as fully equipped as the Halls of Healing, but it\u2019s enough for the people of this city. </p>\n<p>The true sign of Keldabe\u2019s prosperity, of course, is the return of market days. Chortav Meshurkaane is filled again, and people walk the streets freely and without fear. Obi-Wan spends more than one afternoon wandering through the market.</p>\n<p>The Great Hall is once again a training center as Arla and the other True Mandalorians train anyone who wants to learn how to fight. As their numbers grow, they secure the surrounding farms along the Kelita River. And then the nearby towns and then other cities as well.</p>\n<p>By the time communications have been restored, the True Mandalorians have a stronghold in this part of the planet.</p>\n<p>Which is, of course, when they learn that Duchess Satine survived the attempts on her life and is now presiding from a seat of government in Sundari. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this to be another civil war?\u201d Jingko asks.</p>\n<p>Arla scoffs. \u201cIt won\u2019t be much of one. The New Mandalorians have no fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they have the Senate,\u201d Obi-Wan says. He doesn\u2019t normally join the conversation when the advisors gather together, but today he has something to contribute. \u201cSatine Kryze was guarded and protected by the Jedi at the order of the Senate, because the Senate recognizes her as the ruler of Mandalore. If this becomes a war, you won\u2019t be fighting the New Mandalorians. You\u2019ll be fighting the Republic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we aren\u2019t even supposed to <em>try</em>?\u201d Arla demands. She looks as though she\u2019s prepared to fight and that Obi-Wan will make a good first target. \u201cMandalore is our home. She came here from Kalevala with her ideas about <em>peace</em>. At least Kyr\u2019tsad killed us so we could die a warrior\u2019s death. Satine will take our souls. She\u2019ll make dar\u2019manda out of us all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI pointed out why civil war would be a poor option,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cBut there are other options.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean politics.\u201d Arla isn\u2019t the only one to show disgust.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fight on the enemy\u2019s terrain,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a warrior\u2019s first choice, but it is your best choice. Approach it like a battle. Learn the players, learn their strategies, and their weapons. And then lay siege.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan leaves Mandalore two years after he first landed. Mandalore isn\u2019t united when he leaves, Arla and Satine are two powerful women who disagree with the other completely, but it isn\u2019t ripping itself apart anymore.</p>\n<p>He packs his armor away on his transport back to the Temple. He tried to give it to Arla before he left. The armorers could melt it down, craft something for a True Mandalorian. Arla wouldn\u2019t accept it. She told him he had earned it and it was his until he was underserving or he met his death. </p>\n<p>Beskar\u2019gam doesn\u2019t have any place in a Jedi Temple, though, so Obi-Wan tucks it beneath his robes. He\u2019ll keep it in his room at the Temple. There may be other missions where it would be useful to have the protection. </p>\n<p>He keeps the beskar wire in his braid. When Healer Che does his braid for the first time after Mandalore, her fingers pause, but she doesn\u2019t say anything when she sees it. She simply incorporates it into Obi-Wan\u2019s braid, the way he had.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan arrives on Naboo with a team of Jedi and a Republic Relief squad under his command. He\u2019s twenty-five which is young in most of their minds. The beard he\u2019s desperately trying to grow helps but it isn\u2019t enough. The padawan braid doesn\u2019t help either. </p>\n<p>He knows this is his Trial. Healer Che didn\u2019t say anything and neither did Councilor Windu or anyone else at the Temple, but Obi-Wan\u2019s always had a bit of precognition. The scope of this mission and his role in it suggests this is his Trial. If he passes, he will become a full-fledged healer within the Order.</p>\n<p>A rare strain of the common Nubian flu has spread through Theed and the surrounding area. Obi-Wan and his team are here to halt the spread of the virus and find a vaccine for it before it claims too many lives. </p>\n<p>He sets up in the palace to do his research and monitor the health of the queen and her handmaidens. It takes a month, but they develop the vaccine and then figure out how to mass-produce it. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan trains each of the healers with him in how to create the vaccine and administer it. He assigns each Jedi two Republic relief workers and then gives them their city assignments. They\u2019ll set up a vaccination clinic in their city and train others as they administer the vaccine so they can spread to more cities and then towns. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood work, you are doing,\u201d Master Yoda says during Obi-Wan\u2019s weekly check-in.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan inclines his head. \u201cThank you, Master Yoda.\u201d Obi-Wan is in the city proper, staying at the local hospital even though Queen Amidala had been kind enough to offer him a place in the palace. His work is in the hospital and so he sleeps as close to his work as he\u2019s allowed. \u201cThe Force is\u2026troubled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Master Yoda\u2019s ears flatten against his head. \u201cTroubled times, these are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Jinn and Knight Solar have been dispatched to Naboo,\u201d Councilor Windu tells Obi-Wan. \u201cThe Trade Federation is creating difficulties for Naboo. The two will negotiate a peaceful resolution. It shouldn\u2019t affect your work but stay attentive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d Obi-Wan promises. \u201cDo Master Jinn and Knight Solar know I\u2019m on planet? If there is any assistance I can give them, I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will let them know,\u201d Councilor Windu says. \u201cMay the Force be with you, Padawan Kenobi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd also with you, Councilor.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The room shakes. Obi-Wan throws his hands out to stabilize his patients and the machines they\u2019re hooked up to. Around him, vials fall to the floor and shatter. Scalpels and hyposprays and other equipment fall off trays and tables and scatter across the floor.</p>\n<p>There are shouts of surprise and grunts of pain, and Obi-Wan does his best to hold as much steady as he can. When everything settles, he rushes to check and make sure they didn\u2019t lose power during whatever just happened. </p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone find out what just happened!\u201d Obi-Wan calls. He makes sure the oxygen tanks are still working and the kidney dialysis hasn\u2019t stopped. There are over a dozen machines all keeping people alive in this very room, and he allows himself a moment of relief when he realizes they\u2019re still functioning.</p>\n<p>And then he sets about putting his patients at ease.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cA blockade?\u201d Obi-Wan repeats.</p>\n<p>The Nubian guard who brought the information nods. There\u2019s dirt and soot streaked across his face, and a few superficial cuts that he\u2019s already turned down treatment for. \u201cThere is a blockade on the planet, and the Trade Federation has initiated a full-scale invasion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForce help us,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The work camps are grueling. Obi-Wan had tucked his braid away when the invasion reached the hospital, and he hid his lightsaber. Passing himself off as Nubian spared his life, but it also landed him here. </p>\n<p>He works a full shift every day under the close watch of their droid overseers and then he works a second shift in the slapdash medic tent. He treats what wounds he can and then does his best to battle exhaustion and fear. </p>\n<p>Naboo is a peaceful planet, and the Nubians put up almost no resistance to the invasion force. Obi-Wan is surrounded by civilians who don\u2019t understand why anyone wishes them harm. It doesn\u2019t help that rumors say the queen has abandoned her planet, escaped with a Jedi guard and left Naboo to its fate. </p>\n<p>How many check-ins has Obi-Wan missed with the Council? Surely, they\u2019ve heard of the blockade. Is help coming? For everyone or only a private rescue for him and the other Jedi?</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have access to enough information. All he can do is trust in the Force and keep as many people alive as he can until a rescue comes.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Obi-Wan says. He looks around as a wave of Gungans storm through the droids guarding the work camp. A rescue is here, but Obi-Wan can\u2019t shake the heavy, oppressive warning the Force sends his way. </p>\n<p>He has a bad feeling about this.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The closer Obi-Wan gets to the palace, the darker the Force feels. Something is very, very wrong.</p>\n<p>He sneaks in, his entry made easier by the chaos in the halls. He isn\u2019t the first to break into the palace. There\u2019s some kind of revolt happening. There are Nubian guards fighting against droids and their masters. He thinks he hears someone say Queen Amidala has returned. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan reaches the throne room in time to see Queen Amidala point her blaster at a Neimoidian. </p>\n<p>A guard draws a blaster on Obi-Wan. \u201cWho are you and how did you make it in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Obi-Wan Kenobi.\u201d Obi-Wan draws his saber out of its hiding place, but he doesn\u2019t ignite it. \u201cI\u2019m a Jedi, and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have this situation handled,\u201d Queen Amidala says. Her voice is young, but there is steel in her words. \u201cYour fellow Jedi went to the reactor room to face a threat there.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Force grows more insistent, and Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t waste any time. He runs, guided by the Force and the thick, choking darkness it\u2019s trying to expel. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan skids into the room in time to see a Zabrak wielding a red lightsaber drive the point of it through Master Jinn\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Obi-Wan shouts.</p>\n<p>The Zabrak jerks back, and Master Jinn slumps to the ground. Obi-Wan ignites his saber and charges forward. Before he makes it more than three steps, a green blade pushes through the Zabrak\u2019s chest. It\u2019s the Zabrak\u2019s turn to fall. Their saber powers down and rolls across the floor.</p>\n<p>Behind the Zabrak stands Knight Solar in torn, singed robes. He has a wild look in his eyes as if he can\u2019t quite believe what he just did. </p>\n<p>\u201cContact the Council,\u201d Obi-Wan says, snapping into action. This is why he\u2019s a healer, because he doesn\u2019t freeze in situations like this. He\u2019s at Master Jinn\u2019s side in an instant. The lightsaber pierced his lung but not his heart. He\u2019s still alive, if only barely. \u201cTell them what\u2019s happened. Tell them to send Healer Che and do not let anyone separate me from Master Jinn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Knight Solar turns to face Obi-Wan. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to do will save his life or cost both of ours,\u201d Obi-Wan says. </p>\n<p>And then he closes his eyes and opens himself up to the Force. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The Force is present in all things. It does not require belief in order to exist. It simply is. It is in the cores of planets and their atmospheres. It is in naturally growing plants and artificially created minerals. It is in sentients all across the galaxy. </p>\n<p>Master Jinn has a hole in one of his lungs. His heart isn\u2019t directly damaged, but the strain of the fight and then the attack was too much. Obi-Wan weaves his Force presence through Master Jinn\u2019s.</p>\n<p>When Obi-Wan breathes, Master Jinn breathes.</p>\n<p>When Obi-Wan\u2019s heart beats, Master Jinn\u2019s heart beats. </p>\n<p>If Master Jinn dies, Obi-Wan will as well.</p>\n<p>But there is no room for doubt in his mind. There is not even room for hope. All there is is the Force. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan breathes. He lives.</p>\n<p>And Master Jinn lives with him.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan wakes up on a soft, familiar mattress. The walls around him a painted a soothing blue-gray. There is no pain pressing on him from all sides. There is no despair, no deeply rooted depression. There is\u2026peace.</p>\n<p>He blinks the sleep out of his eyes. He\u2019s in his room at the Temple. He waits a moment. Nothing changes. He counts his fingers, raising each one as he goes. And then he counts down.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a dream.</p>\n<p>He rises and then promptly falls back onto his bed as his legs give out. He remembers the work camps on Naboo. He remembers the invasion. He remembers sneaking into the palace. He remembers the cold, creep of the dark.</p>\n<p>He remembers Master Jinn.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s second attempt to rise is far more successful than his first. He leans against his wall until his legs agree to support him. He showers and changes into fresh clothes. He makes himself a cup of Insta-Caf because he doesn\u2019t have the patience to brew a proper cup and then he heads for the Halls of Healing. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t make it past the doors. </p>\n<p>Healer Nikita plucks the caf from his hands. \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to be out of bed. And you certainly aren\u2019t supposed to be drinking caf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. \u201cHow long has it been? Is Master Jinn alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Healer Nikita allows Obi-Wan into the Halls, but she guides him to the break room. She sits him at one of the tables and then fetches him a glass of water and heats up a bowl of oatmeal. She sits across from him and keeps her answers to herself until he takes his first bite of food.</p>\n<p>The oatmeal is warm and filling. It\u2019s apple-cinnamon, the flavor enough to tempt his senses but not so much as to overwhelm them. He eats in greedy spoonfuls and his bowl is empty before he\u2019s even aware of it. </p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Healer Nikita hands him a muffin next. \u201cYou tethered Master Jinn\u2019s self to your own. You kept him steady and stable until Healer Che could arrive. She healed him enough to put him in a healing trance and then brought both of you home. You\u2019ve been asleep since she separated you from Master Jinn.\u201d</p>\n<p>It would explain why Obi-Wan\u2019s so hungry. He eats his muffin, drinks his water, and then searches for something else to eat. \u201cHe\u2019ll live?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Che is optimistic. What you did, you kept him alive. But he was badly injured. There\u2019s no current prediction on how long he\u2019ll be in his trance and even if he wakes from it, he has a long road to recovery ahead of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll live,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>\u201cForce willing,\u201d Healer Nikita says.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan stands in front of the High Council and does his best not to fidget. Today is a moment of celebration, but he finds it difficult to be happy knowing Master Jinn\u2019s status is still uncertain. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s been two days since Obi-Wan woke up, three days since his return to the Temple. </p>\n<p>Healer Che clears her throat and fixes Obi-Wan with a look he\u2019s grown used to over the years. She has been a demanding teacher, but she has never asked for more than he could give. How many times over the years has he been told he\u2019s a credit to her teaching? He hopes she knows each of those were a compliment to her. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to put this off,\u201d Healer Che says. \u201cBecause after this ceremony, I can\u2019t order you to bed, and you haven\u2019t fully recovered.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan laughs and it breaks the heavy tension in the room. \u201cYou are the Chief Healer at the Temple. You can order anyone at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Healer Che\u2019s smile matches his. \u201cAfter this, you can have one drink with your friends and then it\u2019s back to bed with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan laughs again. He allows his joy to spread through the room so the others can share with him. It brings a smile to most of their faces. Councilor Windu, who has acted as a saber master and confidante during Obi-Wan\u2019s apprenticeship, has an open and warm expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is time,\u201d Councilor Windu says.</p>\n<p>There are formal words, spoken by the Councilors, by the Master, by the Padawan, and Obi-Wan treasures them. They are tradition with years of history behind them, and Obi-Wan is present and yet he is a part of every time this has happened in the past. He is Obi-Wan and he is Jedi.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost overwhelming. </p>\n<p>A hand on his face returns him to the present.</p>\n<p>Healer Che stands in front of him. Her eyes are kind as she looks down at him. \u201cPadawan Kenobi,\u201d she says, because the traditional words have been spoken and now, she is free to say something more personal. \u201cYou were sent to Naboo to face your Trial, and you faced an even greater one than we had planned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Force works in mysterious ways,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Healer Che brushes her thumb over his cheekbone. Her expression is solemn. \u201cYou were left on the Temple steps as an infant.\u201d Her touch grows softer as Obi-Wan\u2019s instinct is to flinch away from the words used to hurt him as an initiate. \u201cYou were not unwanted, my padawan. You were needed. And you will continue to be needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes fill with tears, not with the pain of old hurts but because this is a moment too large to contain within his body. He leans in until his forehead touches his master\u2019s. \u201cI will answer the Force\u2019s call until I am no longer able.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Healer Che steps back. She is looking misty eyed as well. \u201cFor the last time, I call you Padawan Kenobi. Will you turn and show me your braid?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan turns so she has access to the long braid he has cultivated since he was just shy of thirteen, and she chose him. He feels the heat from her hands and the pressure of a blade and then nothing. </p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Kenobi,\u201d his former master says, and her voice wavers. \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan turns to face her again. In her hand is coiled his braid. Red hair with beskar wire woven through it to represent his time on Mandalore. Beads to mark his apprenticeship and when he became a senior padawan. Threads to represent major missions. Melida/Daan. Mandalore. Doing relief work with Alderaan. His rotation at the retreat for elderly Jedi. An entire history in the palm of Healer Che\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p><em>His</em> history.</p>\n<p>She places the braid in Obi-Wan\u2019s hand and closes his fist over it. \u201cI am proud of you,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Anakin stays under the bed where no one can see him. The blankets from the bed hang down like walls. It\u2019s dark in here, but it feels like a fort. And he isn\u2019t scared of the dark. There are a lot of things he\u2019s scared of. Being trapped in a sandstorm. Tuskens. Hutts. Slave denotators going off. Losing his mom.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long list. Thinking about it only makes him scared so he thinks about something else.</p>\n<p>Above him, sleeping in the bed, is Master Jinn. Anakin doesn\u2019t know what it means when his master is asleep and doesn\u2019t wake up. On Tatooine, if a master couldn\u2019t defend their property, they would lose it.</p>\n<p>Master Jinn has been nice. Anakin doesn\u2019t want to end up with a master who is mean. </p>\n<p>When Master Jinn said he would take Anakin away from Tatooine, Anakin was excited. When Master Jinn said Anakin could be a Jedi, that was even more exciting. He was sad to leave his mom, but he was going to become a powerful Jedi and then come back and save her, so it was okay.</p>\n<p>But now, he isn\u2019t sure.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s pretty sure he failed the Jedi tests. Master Jinn said it was okay, and Anakin believes him, except Master Jinn is sleeping now. How is he supposed to make everything okay when he\u2019s asleep?</p>\n<p>Flying the spaceship on Naboo was pretty cool. Going to the parade with Padm\u00e9 was even better. But he isn\u2019t on Naboo anymore. He\u2019s on Coruscant at the Jedi Temple, and his master is asleep. </p>\n<p>Anakin\u2019s stomach rumbles. He tries not to think about it. When this place is quieter, he\u2019ll sneak to the kitchen. There\u2019s food there, all kinds, even fresh fruit. There\u2019s water too, and it doesn\u2019t cut off even if he fills an entire glass.</p>\n<p>Anakin is bored hiding here all the time but at least he\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p>He hugs his knees to his chest and breathes as quietly as he can when he hears footsteps enter the room. There aren\u2019t a lot of people who come in here which makes it a good place to hide. Anakin knows the footsteps of the people who usually visit. These ones are different. </p>\n<p>He sees a pair of brown boots stop next to the bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t do more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin doesn\u2019t know this voice. The speaker sounds sad. Anakin doesn\u2019t want him to be sad. He thinks about happy things. Hugs from his mom. When Watto lets him leave early. Playing stickball with his friends. <em>Podracing</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2014no. Huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin holds his breath as the boots shuffle backward. And then a hand lifts the sheet, and he sees a man\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>\u201cHello, there,\u201d the man says. </p>\n<p>Anakin squeezes his eyes shut. Maybe, if he wishes really, really hard, the man will forget he\u2019s here. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Obi-Wan Kenobi,\u201d the man says.</p>\n<p>Anakin cracks an eye open.</p>\n<p>The man tucks the sheet under the mattress to keep it raised and then he sits cross-legged on the ground. He offers Anakin a smile. He has the beginnings of a beard. It\u2019s red, like the hair on his head. He has a nice smile, but he\u2019s a stranger and Anakin knows better than to trust strangers. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk until you\u2019re ready,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk when I first came to the Temple. I was an infant and so no one expected me to talk.\u201d He smiles. Anakin thinks it\u2019s a nice smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a big place. It can be overwhelming if someone\u2019s never been to it before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin unfurls enough to nod his head. The Temple <em>is</em> big. There\u2019s so many rooms and hallways and people. It took him a long time to find a good place to hide. He\u2019s afraid if he leaves it, he won\u2019t find his way back. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. He opens a pouch on his belt and produces several foil-wrapped items. He sets them on the ground between them. \u201cI carry snacks with me, because sometimes I forget to eat. You\u2019re welcome to any, or all, of those. I can always get more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Is this a trap? If Anakin takes it, will he owe Obi-Wan something? He doesn\u2019t want to be in debt. That\u2019s how people become slaves. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a healer,\u201d Obi-Wan says, as if he doesn\u2019t mind talking for both of them. \u201cI was a padawan until I went to Naboo. I was supposed to help with an outbreak of the flu. And then the planet was invaded.\u201d He looks up, probably at Master Jinn. \u201cDo you know Master Jinn?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cHe is something of a legend at the Temple. He is one of the best negotiators we have, but his methods are unconventional. Did he go on Search? Is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan looks above him again, as if he\u2019s searching for answers in the air. Anakin darts his hand out to grab one of the packages. He tucks his bounty away before Obi-Wan\u2019s gaze returns to him. </p>\n<p>Anakin isn\u2019t sure if he likes the way Obi-Wan looks at him. He looks at him kinda like Master Jinn did, like he can see something that isn\u2019t there. </p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like a bath?\u201d Obi-Wan offers. \u201cOr new clothes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin almost says yes and then he shakes his head twice, as hard as he can. This is a trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want food, you don\u2019t want a bath, you don\u2019t want clothes.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s face scrunches up. \u201cA bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin points to the pillow and blanket he snuck down here. Obi-Wan feels sad again, like someone cracked open a black melon and it was full of sadness instead of stinky milk. Anakin tries to think happy thoughts again, but this time they meet a barrier and don\u2019t go through.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re naturally gifted,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cAnd you have a kind heart. Will you let me be kind to you in return?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin thinks about it. Obi-Wan seems nice, and he wants to go with him, because all those things sound nice. A bath. Food. Clean clothes. But Anakin can\u2019t. He can\u2019t leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Master Jinn\u2019s.\u201d They\u2019re Anakin\u2019s first words to Obi-Wan, and he wants to snatch them back, but it\u2019s too late. He already said them.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s forehead wrinkles as he frowns. \u201cYou\u2019re Master Jinn\u2019s padawan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m Master Jinn\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan taps his fingers against his chin. \u201cYou want to stay here with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. What if I go and get some food and some clean clothes and some washcloths and come back? Would that be okay with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin isn\u2019t sure. He can\u2019t leave, but can he accept gifts? \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan is sad again. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t need to pay for any of those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Jinn is asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to pay for them either,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cYou\u2019re at the Jedi Temple. We take care of those who stay with us and right now, you\u2019re staying with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Anakin says. And then, because his mom raised him right, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan comes back like he promised. He goes to the table and sets down a pile of food, a stack of clothes, and a bowl with some water and cloths in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you like first?\u201d Obi-Wan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can choose?\u201d Anakin\u2019s so excited, he forgets he didn\u2019t want to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can choose. And you can have all three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin creeps forward. He snatches a roll from the offering of food and takes a bite. He tries to say something, but his mouth is too full. The roll has something sweet inside! He looks at the second half, still in his hand. There\u2019s something purple and sticky in the middle of the roll.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s blackberry jam,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cDo they have blackberries where you\u2019re from?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin shakes his head. He takes another roll and bites into it. This one has spiced meat and cheese. He moans and grabs the last surprise roll. He eats all three of them. His stomach hurts a little, but it\u2019s worth it. \u201cClean now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have another choice,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cYou can clean yourself or I can clean you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMyself,\u201d Anakin answers quickly, before Obi-Wan can change his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you like me to leave the room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to close the door,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re all done, open it again, and I\u2019ll come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEventually, I\u2019ll have to come in, because my patient is in here. I\u2019ll knock first, and I\u2019ll wait until I can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Anakin spits on his palm the way he\u2019s seen smugglers do, and then he holds his hand out to Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan hesitates but he does shake Anakin\u2019s hand. \u201cNow, we both need to get clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin scrubs himself with the water. Master Jinn must be rich if he can afford for his slaves to wash with water. But if he\u2019s rich, why couldn\u2019t he buy a hyperdrive on Tatooine?</p>\n<p>Anakin stashes some of the food under the bed. He munches on some orange sticks and then decides it\u2019s kinda boring with just a sleeping Master Jinn for company. He opens the door so Obi-Wan knows Anakin is done washing. </p>\n<p>\u201cObi-Wan.\u201d </p>\n<p>Anakin\u2019s heart rate picks up at the sound of a new voice. He dives under the bed and pulls the sheet down to hide. Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t feel as scared as Anakin, but he doesn\u2019t feel right, either. </p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Che,\u201d Obi-Wan greets. His voice is smooth and pleasant as if there\u2019s nothing wrong. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone with me. I trained you, remember? Why did Master Jinn\u2019s door open? I know he isn\u2019t awake yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Obi-Wan pauses and Anakin\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to tell on Anakin. \u201cWould you believe I didn\u2019t feel like opening the door with my hand?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence, but it feels weird. It\u2019s like a conversation, except Anakin can\u2019t hear any of the words. He doesn\u2019t like it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Healer Che finally says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the Council to call off their search.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Anakin uses his finger to get the last of his oatmeal out of his bowl, because Obi-Wan says it\u2019s rude to lick the bowl. Obi-Wan feels weird again today, but Anakin wants a full stomach before he asks about it. It\u2019ll be easier to run if he isn\u2019t hungry. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m a healer,\u201d Obi-Wan says as he hands Anakin an apple, already sliced into eight pieces so it\u2019s easier for Anakin to eat. Last night, Obi-Wan gave him a baked apple with cinnamon sprinkled on it. Anakin doesn\u2019t understand how that\u2019s a treat and a raw apple is healthy, but he doesn\u2019t want to ask in case Obi-Wan thinks he\u2019s stupid.</p>\n<p>Anakin eats a whole slice before he nods. \u201cYou help people here. Like Master Jinn.\u201d A thought occurs to Anakin. \u201cAre you his too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I\u2014no.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes fill with sadness and it <em>hurts</em>, but then he blinks and he looks and feels calm again. \u201cI\u2019m a healer and he\u2019s my patient. I would like it if you would be my patient too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d Anakin says. Sick slaves cost money instead of earning it and that\u2019s a good way to end up dead or sold to the mines. He doesn\u2019t know if they have mines on Coruscant, but he doesn\u2019t want to find out. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad but people can see healers even when they aren\u2019t sick. I can help to make sure you don\u2019t get sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan nods. \u201cI can help your body protect itself against the germs and viruses which make you sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want that,\u201d Anakin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever been to a healer?\u201d Obi-Wan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Would you like me to do the scan with my hands or would you like me to have a droid do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have droids here?\u201d Anakin perks up. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t stay in this room forever. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou like droids?\u201d Obi-Wan smiles. \u201cLet me get my helper. You hop up on the bed, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin does what he\u2019s told and hops up on the second bed in the room. Obi-Wan brought it in when Anakin refused to leave the room except to use the fresher or to sneak into the kitchen when no one\u2019s around. He thinks Obi-Wan knows when he leaves, but he hasn\u2019t stopped him. </p>\n<p>His legs are too short to reach the floor, so Anakin swings his feet. A bipedal droid with four arms enters. Obi-Wan follows with a cart full of things Anakin\u2019s never seen before. He pulls his knees up to his chest as Obi-Wan closes the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am K-14,\u201d the droid says. \u201cYou are my patient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Anakin,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help make sure I don\u2019t get sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. First, I am going to run a diagnostic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA dia\u2014what?\u201d Anakin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cA scan,\u201d Obi-Wan answers. \u201cHe\u2019s going to check your body to see if there are any hurts we should take care of before we start talking about boosters and vaccines.\u201d Obi-Wan holds up a handheld device. \u201cThis is a medical scanner. K-14 is going to use it to check the inside and outside of your body. The scanner means he doesn\u2019t have to touch you to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can see inside my body with that?\u201d Anakin asks.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan points to the monitor on the cart he brought in. \u201cYou can watch. But first, can you stretch out on the bed? It will make the scan easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin stretches out on his back. He cranes his neck to see the screen, but Obi-Wan rolls the cart so he can see easier. K-14 turns the scanner on and then slowly moves it from Anakin\u2019s head to his toes. As he does, a picture of a body shows up on the screen. Is that Anakin\u2019s body? What do all the colors mean? Are they good colors? Bad colors?</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are different settings,\u201d Obi-Wan explains. He holds up a remote and points it at the screen. \u201cI can look at your bones, your muscles, a full body image. It probably looks confusing, maybe even scary to you, because you don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Anakin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do. I can tell you what I see, K-14 can tell you, or we can begin treating you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cWill you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan switches back to the image with no colors. Anakin thinks this is the bone one. Obi-Wan points to a darker spot near Anakin\u2019s knee. \u201cThis tells me you broke your bone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPodracing accident,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cIt hurt a lot. Watto was really mad, because I cried and customers don\u2019t like crying kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan points to another spot, this one on Anakin\u2019s left arm. \u201cThis was a broken bone as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fell off a roof,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cMe and Kresh were playing smugglers and \u2018forcement, and I tried to jump from one roof to another, but I didn\u2019t make it.\u201d He squints at the picture. \u201cIs this like a map of my body? How\u2019d you learn to read it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is like a map of your body. It shows me your present life and your past. And I learned to read it through many, many years of studying. There\u2019s one more thing on this picture I want to talk about.\u201d Obi-Wan taps a little shadow high up on Anakin\u2019s leg. </p>\n<p>Anakin squints and leans in. He wouldn\u2019t have seen that if Obi-Wan didn\u2019t tell him to look for it. He shrugs and looks over at Obi-Wan. \u201cI haven\u2019t studied body maps. Is it another broken bone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chip,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>Anakin looks again. That\u2019s his slave chip? That tiny little shadow is his chip? He looks at his leg and pokes at his tunics. He can\u2019t feel the chip. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s voice is gentle and soft, like when Anakin\u2019s mom would talk to some of the girls who worked for Gardulla. \u201cThis is a slave chip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you comfortable answering some questions for me? I want to help you, but I need more information.\u201d </p>\n<p>Anakin isn\u2019t sure. Obi-Wan has been nice, but what if he decides he doesn\u2019t want to be anymore? What if he\u2019s trying to lure Anakin away from Master Jinn? Anakin looks at the sleeping man on the other bed. He wishes Master Jinn would wake up. He\u2019s alone here, and it makes him scared. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I ask questions and you answer if you\u2019re comfortable?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin shrugs. And then he nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Obi-Wan sits in the visitor\u2019s chair. It means he\u2019s shorter than Anakin which Anakin likes, even if it\u2019s kinda like a trick. Obi-Wan is bigger than him even if he doesn\u2019t look like it right now. Obi-Wan clears his throat. \u201cWhat planet are you from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTatooine.\u201d If all the questions are this easy, Anakin thinks he\u2019ll answer them all.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you meet Master Jinn there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods. \u201cPadm\u00e9 was there too. They needed help.\u201d Anakin wiggles on the bed, because this is a good story. And if Obi-Wan thinks he\u2019s useful, he\u2019ll keep looking after Anakin. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have enough money for a hyperdrive so they bet on me in the podrace. And I won! And I won so big that Master Jinn got the hyperdrive and me. He says I\u2019m going to be a Jedi, but he\u2019s still sleeping, and I don\u2019t think the others like me. Will you help me become a Jedi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help you be safe, healthy, and happy,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cYou said Master Jinn bet on your race?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin nods. \u201cMaster Watto owns a junk shop, and he doesn\u2019t take Republic credits so Master Jinn couldn\u2019t buy the part he needed. But Watto likes to bet so Master Jinn did that instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatto owned you?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. His voice is controlled, but Anakin can feel a lot of emotions in Obi-Wan\u2019s head that are trying to escape. He doesn\u2019t think Obi-Wan is actually calm. </p>\n<p>Anakin nods. Is this the wrong answer? Is Obi-Wan mad at him? \u201cYou saw the chip on my body map.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. Anakin, when I first met you, you told me you\u2019re Master Jinn\u2019s. Do you think he\u2019s your owner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won me,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cWatto gave him the detonator so I won\u2019t blow up anymore, but I still have the chip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan takes a deep breath. Anakin pulls his knees up to his chest, because Obi-Wan feels angry now. But then he takes another breath, and the anger goes somewhere else. Anakin looks around as if he can see it. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin, I think there was some confusion. You aren\u2019t a slave anymore. You don\u2019t belong to Master Jinn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin frowns. \u201cSo I\u2019m alone? Who\u2019s going to look after me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t alone. You\u2019re at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and we\u2019ll look after you. But you aren\u2019t a slave, Anakin. You\u2019re free now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means you have choices. It means you don\u2019t have to stay in Master Jinn\u2019s room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere would I stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe initiate dorms, I would think,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where kids your age live. You wouldn\u2019t be alone, and there would be kids for you to talk to and play with. During the day, you can go to classes and learn about things that interest you. There\u2019s a commissary where you can eat each of your meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lot. Anakin isn\u2019t sure where to even start thinking about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt also means I can take your slave chip out,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to Wrirrra. He\u2019s the clan-parent for one of the initiate clans. If you feel comfortable with him, he can help you pick out a bed and make some friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want my chip out,\u201d Anakin says. \u201cAnd we can meet your friend. I want to start my Jedi lessons. Once I\u2019m big and strong like Master Jinn, I\u2019m going back to Tatooine to free my mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Obi-Wan asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d Anakin repeats. \u201cShe\u2019s still on Tatooine. Master Jinn tried to win her too, but Watto said no. I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re worried,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cHow about this. We take your chip out, I take a holo, and I find someone to bring it to your mom so she knows you\u2019re at the Temple and happy. You can write her a note if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t write.\u201d Anakin stares at his knees. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Maybe that\u2019s one of the classes we can start you with. Would you like to learn how to read and write?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can make that decision later,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cFirst, we have a chip to remove. It\u2019s a small procedure, but it\u2019s still surgery. Would you like to sleep through it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anakin shakes his head as hard as he can. If he\u2019s asleep, how does he know Obi-Wan will actually take it out? He wants to see it come out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cI will use a numbing agent, but it will feel funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill it scar?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan opens his mouth and then hesitates. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want a scar,\u201d Anakin says. He wants to know the chip is out, and he wants a reminder that it\u2019s gone. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have one,\u201d Obi-Wan promises.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan is right. It does feel funny when he cuts open Anakin\u2019s leg to remove the chip. It doesn\u2019t hurt but he still feels it. He stays very still so Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t cut more of him than he\u2019s supposed to. </p>\n<p>When it\u2019s over, Obi-Wan puts a band-aid on the cut. And then he holds out a jar of lollipops. \u201cPick one,\u201d he tells Anakin.</p>\n<p>Anakin picks blue, because it\u2019s the color of Obi-Wan\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d Bail says as he sits across from Obi-Wan at a caf\u00e9. Bail has a fruit smoothie, because his med-droid has started making noise again about tattling on his health to Breha. Obi-Wan, of course, has a large iced-caf that probably has at least twice the recommended amount of caffeine in it. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s smile, charming and innocent enough to fool strangers, gets him all kinds of things. Extra caffeine shots is only one of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Obi-Wan asks. He blows on his drink before he seems to remember it\u2019s an iced drink and not a hot one. </p>\n<p>Bail wouldn\u2019t say he and Obi-Wan are friends if anyone asked. Privately, in his head, he likes to think they\u2019re, if not friends, then close acquaintances. Bail has always been active politically, even before he became a senator for Alderaan. But becoming a senator, and prince consort, has given him the means to achieve what had once seemed like far-off dreams. </p>\n<p>In keeping with an Alderaanian tradition, Bail spent his first senate recess on an aid mission to Ryloth. Bail isn\u2019t sure if Breha pulled strings or if the Jedi saw Bail\u2019s mission and decided it would be simple to add their own team to his, but Bail gained two Jedi. One of them was apparently on Search which meant he was looking for any Force sensitives who wanted to train at the Coruscant Temple.</p>\n<p>The second was Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>He was a solemn, almost twenty-year-old. A senior padawan, but if anyone thought padawan meant child or learner, they quickly revised their opinion after meeting Obi-Wan. His assistance on the mission was instrumental. He speaks Twi-lek which was useful when communicating with the natives of Ryloth, and he knows a lot about healing.</p>\n<p>He also, which Bail didn\u2019t realize at first, carries a lightsaber despite being a healer.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his skills as healer and sabermaster were both needed.</p>\n<p>Maybe Bail isn\u2019t used to fighting alongside someone, and he created a relationship where there was none. But every time he asks Obi-Wan to meet him for a drink, Obi-Wan responds. If he\u2019s on Coruscant, he almost always comes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were knighted recently.\u201d Bail nods toward Obi-Wan\u2019s hair. There\u2019s no long braid to be seen. Obi-Wan had hidden it when they were on Ryloth, but whenever they meet on Coruscant, he displays it proudly. For it to be missing means he graduated or whatever it is the Jedi call it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am Healer Kenobi instead of Senior Padawan Kenobi.\u201d Obi-Wan smiles and it\u2019s almost too small to notice, but Bail can tell he\u2019s pleased. Maybe even a little proud. It\u2019s good. He should be. Despite living in sight of the Jedi Temple, Bail doesn\u2019t know many actual Jedi. He knows the stories, the good ones and the bad ones. He knows the reports the Senate receives, but Obi-Wan makes the Jedi real for him. </p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations are in order. And maybe a drink stronger than this.\u201d Bail laughs as he drinks his smoothie. It\u2019s quite good, a mix of berries native to Alderaan and thickened with a protein-heavy yogurt. Maybe he should try and get one every morning. Or make one at his apartment. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like drinking with Jedi,\u201d Obi-Wan says. His eyes dance with mischief. \u201cWe can filter alcohol. No hangovers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s smile brightens even more. And then he sobers. He looks around as if assessing their surroundings. He must decide their position is private enough, because he leans forward and says, \u201cI do have a request. You are under no obligation to help. Any assistance you can provide, even a different contact, will be appreciated.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can a junior senator do that the Jedi can\u2019t?\u201d Bail asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Master Jinn left Tatooine, he brought a boy with him. Master Jinn was able to secure his freedom but not his mother\u2019s. I have heard,\u201d again, Obi-Wan does a quick scan of the area, \u201cthat Alderaan may have experience in this area.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bail nods. It\u2019s easy enough to confirm what Obi-Wan either suspects or knows. Alderaan prides itself on being a peaceful planet. They have prosperity, and they do their best to share that prosperity with others. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s done quietly, but Alderaan does have extensive contacts within the Freedom Lanes. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe boy is\u2026adjusting.\u201d Obi-Wan frowns as if it hasn\u2019t been a smooth adjustment. \u201cBut he worries for his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstandable,\u201d Bail says, to both points. Moving from Tatooine to Coruscant would be an adjustment for anyone. Adding the fact that the boy is a former slave to the mix only complicates it. \u201cDo you have anything to help with the search?\u201d</p>\n<p>Under the table, Bail feels Obi-Wan touch his knee. A moment later, a small pouch is placed on his thigh. Obi-Wan lowers his voice. \u201cThat is the boy\u2019s slave chip. It should be enough to find his mother. I\u2019ve included a few details on his life on the planet which should narrow it down even more. There\u2019s also a holo of the boy. For his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe holo will be given to her,\u201d Bail promises. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do everything in my power with regard to the second request.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Obi-Wan smile is genuine. And then it shifts into something playful as he leans back in his seat. \u201cTell me, how does a junior senator balance his obligations to his seat in government with his obligations as prince consort?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you asking how often I have sex with my wife?\u201d Bail asks.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan gasps in mock-offense. \u201cSuch a scandalous topic of conversation, senator. I have sensitive ears, you know. I was raised in the Jedi Temple.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bail laughs at Obi-Wan\u2019s antics and drinks from his smoothie again.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Chilea returns from her mission and reports directly to Bail\u2019s office. He chose her because she\u2019s one of his best operatives. She\u2019s unassuming and she has a knack for blending into her environments so people rarely realize she\u2019s somewhere she shouldn\u2019t be. </p>\n<p>\u201cSenator,\u201d she says with a curl to her words. She activates the anti-spy hardware he had installed when he took his position. Anyone who has his place bugged will assume he threw up the privacy shields so he could have a liaison. </p>\n<p>\u201cSuccess?\u201d Bail asks. Despite the precautions, it\u2019s best to keep the conversation as bland as possible. </p>\n<p>Chilea saunters forward. She leans in to kiss him. He sighs into the kiss and pushes out from his desk so she can sit in his lap. This is not a precaution. This is simply a benefit to having an open relationship with his wife. </p>\n<p>As they kiss, Chilea slips something into Bail\u2019s pocket. And then she cups him between his legs and laughs as he tips his head back to draw in a sharp breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cSuccess,\u201d Chilea answers. \u201cAnd she\u2019s staying to continue the success.\u201d</p>\n<p>Interesting, Bail thinks, even as Chilea tries to distract him by kissing his neck. He had made sure Chilea was empowered to offer Shmi Skywalker anything in Alderaan\u2019s ability to give. He had thought she would relocate to Naboo, a nearby planet or even Alderaan which is both peaceful and close to Coruscant.</p>\n<p>He finds he isn\u2019t altogether surprised that she chose to stay on Tatooine and help others find their freedom. If her son is anything like her, the galaxy is fortunate to have him learning to be a Jedi.</p>\n<p>Chilea pats the pocket with something in it. \u201cThat isn\u2019t for you,\u201d she tells him. And then she guides his hand between her legs. \u201cThis, however, could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bail laughs and decides his reports can wait. \u201cShall we take this to the bedroom and see if Breha is available?\u201d</p>\n<p>If she is, she\u2019ll watch and maybe add some commentary or direction as Bail and Chilea bed each other. If she isn\u2019t, they\u2019ll send her a recording. Bail considers telling Obi-Wan about this arrangement the next time he teases Bail about being away from his wife. And then he laughs. Obi-Wan wouldn\u2019t believe him. Or he would and then take it as a challenge to find a topic which will make Bail blush.</p>\n<p>Best not to encourage him.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Bail meets Obi-Wan at a diner rather than their usual caf\u00e9. He nods politely to the Besalisk behind the counter and then works his way to the back of the diner where Obi-Wan already has a booth. </p>\n<p>Bail tries not to judge, because he\u2019s aware he comes from a prosperous planet, and, even for a citizen of Alderaan, he\u2019s quite privileged, but this is not the sort of place he would frequent by choice. He\u2019s almost certain two tables away there are two beings betting with spice as the stakes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t tarnish your reputation,\u201d Obi-Wan says. He fiddles with the saltshaker, and Bail feels the hum as anti-eavesdropping technology kicks on. Apparently, Bail isn\u2019t the only one made paranoid by Coruscant. \u201cBut this was a necessary change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Bail says. He looks Obi-Wan over. There are dark circles under his eyes, darker than the last time they met. \u201cWould you like to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bail is a senator. He knows better than to play these games with Obi-Wan, because Bail won\u2019t win. \u201cAnything you\u2019d like. You seem troubled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Jinn is still in his healing trance. Healer Che isn\u2019t concerned, but the longer he\u2019s in the trance, the longer his recovery will be once he comes out of it. He will have complications for the rest of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll have a life,\u201d Bail says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Obi-Wan nods as if he\u2019d forgotten that he had already pulled off a miracle by saving the man\u2019s life. \u201cThe boy\u2026\u201d Obi-Wan traces shapes on the table. \u201cQui-Gon is his biggest advocate. He\u2019s stuck in a state of uncertainty until Qui-Gon is awake and can fight for him. Uncertainty is the last thing the boy needs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a Jedi?\u201d Bail asks.</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s lips quirk up as if he thinks Bail\u2019s ignorance about the Jedi is amusing. \u201cThe Temple takes in younglings. We call them initiates. They\u2019ve given basic training in the Force along with a more standard education. When they are chosen by a master, they become padawans and officially start on their journey toward what most people would call being a Jedi. The boy is an uncommon case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obi-Wan pauses as a droid wheels over with a platter for each of them. Bail didn\u2019t order, but Obi-Wan doesn\u2019t find this abnormal, so he accepts what is more food than he has any hope of eating in one sitting. It\u2019s fried and greasy and looks delicious. It also looks like it\u2019ll earn him a scolding from his med-droid.</p>\n<p>\u201cIndulge,\u201d Obi-Wan says as if he can tell what Bail is thinking. Obi-Wan\u2019s burger has a fried egg on it so Bail suspects he should be pleased that his at least only seems to have onion straws. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe boy?\u201d Bail prompts.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s older than the Temple normally accepts younglings,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cAnd life has not been kind to him. His past, combined with the power he has, it could end poorly. There is a lot of debate on his future. It will remain uncertain until Qui-Gon wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime?\u201d Bail asks sharply, more sharply than Obi-Wan deserves, but if the boy is being mistreated, Bail will throw the full power of Alderaan behind his complaint. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve argued that he should be treated as an initiate,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cHaving friends his age, learning to play and interact with others is important. He\u2019s attending standard classes, because he didn\u2019t have the education that a child on Alderaan, for example, would have. And he\u2019s in very basic Force lessons. Control, mostly. Meditation. He\u2019s being given the foundation he would have received if he came to us sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut?\u201d Bail asks. Something is clearly bothering the man in front of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bright child, and he\u2019s old enough to realize he\u2019s different from the others. I worry for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you worry about him?\u201d Bail remembers the comment about the Jedi fearing he might be dangerous. True, he had to read between the lines of Obi-Wan\u2019s careful answers, but it\u2019s there. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan takes the question seriously. He thinks it through as he takes a bite of his burger. After he wipes his face, prim and proper even in this diner, he says, \u201cNo. There are many paths besides the path of a Jedi knight. He will find a place within the Order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut?\u201d Bail asks again. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have concerns,\u201d Obi-Wan says. He drags a fry through his ketchup, but he doesn\u2019t eat it. \u201cMaster Jinn couldn\u2019t free the boy\u2019s mother because of circumstances. But there was no follow-up. There should have been. The Force has become\u2026clouded recently, but Jedi are supposed to see the full picture. I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re seeing part of it and then looking no further. It happened with the boy\u2019s mother, and I think it\u2019s happening again with the boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bail has concerns as well. If the Jedi are not as infallible as they appear, what are the safeguards in place? And where are the senators providing oversight and assistance? Their abilities make the Jedi seem larger than life, but they\u2019re still beings, capable of mistakes. And the Order isn\u2019t very large, not in comparison to planetary populations. Why should the Jedi bear the burden for righting the galaxy\u2019s wrongs? It should be a collaborative effort. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw,\u201d Bail says. \u201cYou reached out about the boy\u2019s mother and it sounds like you\u2019re helping the boy as much as you\u2019re able.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never should have needed to.\u201d Obi-Wan shakes himself. \u201cSomething to meditate on. As you said, we are correcting the missteps we made in this situation. It will have a happy ending.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d Bail asks, recognizing when a change in conversation is needed. </p>\n<p>Obi-Wan\u2019s smile returns but now that he\u2019s looking for it, Bail can see the shadows around it. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you. But Dex makes the best comfort food on Coruscant. If you ever come here without me, don\u2019t order. Let him make you a special. I\u2019m convinced he has some Force sensitivity. There\u2019s no other way he can know what someone needs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a puzzle,\u201d Bail says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you now going to be a regular here?\u201d Obi-Wan fiddles with the saltshaker again and the background buzz disappears. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am a man of the people,\u201d Bail says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlderaan has four different forks for formal occasions,\u201d Obi-Wan says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re eating with your hands right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to spin it,\u201d Bail says. \u201cI am, after all, a politician.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Obi-Wan says.</p>\n<p>With a message from Shmi Skywalker sitting in his pocket, Bail can believe it. The trick, of course, is to continue to be a good man.</p>\n<p>Mace almost misses when Obi-Wan was a padawan and intimidated by him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat part of limited missions do you not understand?\u201d Obi-Wan, no, <em>Healer Kenobi</em>, demands.</p>\n<p>He stands at the center of the Council Chamber, a tightly leashed maelstrom of fury. The worst part is, Mace knows he and his fellow Councilors are in the wrong. After Qui-Gon came out of his healing trance, it took nearly a year of physical therapy and healing sessions for him to regain his strength.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll never have it completely back. The healers made it a condition of his return to the field that his missions would be carefully vetted by their team, and they had to give approval. Qui-Gon has chafed under the restrictions, and Mace suspects he\u2019s ashamed a bit by having them. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to have a padawan like Anakin Skywalker, who is bursting with energy and excitement, and not be able to keep up with them. But Mace has knowns Qui-Gon for many, many years. He knew Qui-Gon would try and slip the restrictions. He should have kept a more careful eye on him. </p>\n<p>\u201cTracking a bounty hunter, he was,\u201d Master Yoda says. \u201cWithin his abilities, it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe should have transferred the mission once he knew how to follow the bounty hunter,\u201d Healer Kenobi says. \u201cInstead, you tell me he decided to hunt the hunter, and he\u2019s now a prisoner on Geonosis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPadawan Skywalker and Senator Amidala were dispatched to rescue him,\u201d Saesee Tiin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Healer Kenobi asks weakly, as if he doesn\u2019t have the energy for two fights.</p>\n<p>Mace worries because they are about to place an even greater weight on young Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulders. What is it Vokara asked Mace that time Obi-Wan dueled Yan Dooku? Why had the Force given her padawan so much endurance? For moments like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cQui-Gon Jinn found something disturbing when he followed Jango Fett,\u201d Plo Koon says. He waits until he has Healer Kenobi\u2019s full attention to continue. \u201cThere is an army there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA clone army over a million strong. They were created for the Jedi, and they are ready to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace watches Healer Kenobi try to process. He and his fellow Councilors have already gone through this, but Mace doesn\u2019t have any tips on how to digest the information. An entire army, created in secret. And they will be used. Force help them all, but the clones will be used. </p>\n<p>\u201cSkywalker reported droid factories on Geonosis before he was captured,\u201d Mace says. \u201cWe\u2019re assembling a Jedi response team. You will select the healers that will accompany us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi shakes his head. His confusion clears, and he sets his jaw in a familiar, stubborn, manner. \u201cA Jedi response team? You mean a declaration of war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbandon our own, we cannot,\u201d Master Yoda says.</p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi swallows thickly. The pain is his eyes is kept carefully behind his shields. \u201cMaster Jinn, Padawan Skywalker, and Senator Amidala violated Geonosian law. If the Jedi interfere with Geonosian justice, we violate our neutrality.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeonosian justice is execution via battle arena,\u201d Saesee says. </p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi closes his eyes. \u201cI do not believe in the death penalty, but we are in the wrong here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSenator Amidala was investigating on behalf of the Senate,\u201d Ki-Adi Mundi says. \u201cThe Republic has authorized us to use the troops on Kamino to secure her rescue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will mean war.\u201d Healer Kenobi\u2019s words are barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to the Senate, war has already been declared. We\u2019re only responding to it,\u201d Ki-Adi says.</p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi locks his hands behind back. \u201cI should select combat healers, then. Did Padawan Skywalker or Senator Amidala\u2019s intelligence give any indication of the size or capability of the enemy\u2019s forces?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mace suddenly remembers seeing the haunted look in Kenobi\u2019s eyes after Melida/Daan. He remembers the quiet strength he showed after Mandalore. He remembers the fear after Naboo. He is uniquely trained for their upcoming challenges. Mace wishes he could shield him from it. He wishes he could shield them all from it.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Mace travels to Geonosis with Healer Kenobi. Despite being a healer, it was Kenobi they listened to when discussing strategy. Several Council members wanted to throw the entire weight of the Jedi Order and this new army at Geonosis.</p>\n<p>Kenobi cautioned them against it. They have proof of an enemy growing where they didn\u2019t see. They have evidence of an army raised for their side where they didn\u2019t see. This war was inevitable. Perhaps even planned. A devastating victory on Geonosis won\u2019t end it. </p>\n<p>And, the painful truth is, the Jedi aren\u2019t prepared. If they send a large force, they\u2019re likely to lose them. </p>\n<p>The number of Jedi are small, and the number of clone troopers is large. Their objective is to rescue their people, gain as much intel as they can, and then leave. </p>\n<p>The Senate is already debating how to handle these new revelations. Mace left his former padawan, Depa Billaba in charge of coordinating with the Senate and relaying any relevant information to Mace and Yoda, who will be on the frontline on Geonosis. </p>\n<p>From what Depa tells him, he should grow comfortable with the frontline. </p>\n<p>The thought sickens him. He is a Jedi. He walks the thin line between light and dark, but he is a lightsider. He believes in the galaxy, and he believes in the Jedi. To lead an army, to fight a war\u2026doesn\u2019t that go against everything he is?</p>\n<p>But what if the war is fought to protect the galaxy? Does that make it right?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Mace looks over at Healer Kenobi, and he sees the same questions on Healer Kenobi\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Geonosis happens.</p>\n<p>Mace kills Jango Fett.</p>\n<p>Count Dooku escapes.</p>\n<p>Hundreds die and Mace\u2019s first thought is to be grateful Healer Kenobi argued against sending more Jedi. His second thought is that that means it\u2019s clone troopers who died, not Jedi. They shouldn\u2019t have died either. </p>\n<p>Mace vows to himself that when he is given command, because he knows it is coming, it is inevitable, he will never value his life or his fellow Jedi\u2019s lives over that of the men under his command.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t enough but everything is moving too quickly.</p>\n<p>A thousand futures fade away and ten thousand more take their place.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi stands at the center of the Council Chamber, and Mace at first thinks he\u2019s stuck in possibilities of the future again. Or maybe he\u2019s gone into the past. But no. This is a familiar scene, but it is a new one. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe are all needed in these dark times,\u201d Saesee says. </p>\n<p>\u201cGiven command of the 7th Sky Corps, General Jinn has been,\u201d Yoda explains. </p>\n<p>Healer Kenobi\u2019s hands twitch. \u201cThe healers have made it <em>very</em> clear\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have,\u201d Plo Koon interrupts, because they all know how long Healer Kenobi can go when he\u2019s riled up. Still, Plo Koon is a brave man to interrupt Healer Kenobi. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re assigning you to General Jinn. Where he goes, you go. You will be able to monitor his health as needed, and he\u2019ll be able to personally oversee the 212th. I will discuss the full details with you this evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>The full details? Mace isn\u2019t aware of there being more details beyond that. They need Qui-Gon in the field, and the healers might finally revolt if that happens. Sending Kenobi along should appease them; though, Force knows, Qui-Gon will throw a fit about it. Mace will no doubt receive several angry comms in response. </p>\n<p>At least it\u2019ll be a break from angry comms about giving Skywalker a field knighting. </p>\n<p>Mace still isn\u2019t sure it was the right choice. Skywalker faced Dooku, and he held his own against the Fallen master. He lost a limb and didn\u2019t give into anger. Does that make a knight? Does that make a Jedi? To lose and not give in to the dark side? To simply survive? </p>\n<p>They need knights and masters to run the army they now command. Did they knight Skywalker because they needed him or because he was ready? </p>\n<p>This situation is fucked. </p>\n<p>And it\u2019s only just beginning.</p>\n<p>The first time Cody sees Kenobi is on Geonosis. Geonosis is a shitshow. No number of drills on Kamino or battle simulations could prepare them for it. It was fast, it was ugly, and there was death. </p>\n<p>So. Much. Death.</p>\n<p>The Prime taught them about death. How their brothers don\u2019t leave them forever. They go marching beyond and one day, they\u2019ll be together again. The Prime taught them to say the Remembrances. But so many brothers died, and there\u2019s no complete casualty list. </p>\n<p>There are brothers whose names won\u2019t be said. Brothers who died and will be forgotten. </p>\n<p>It is in this haze that Cody sees Kenobi. The man is a beacon. There is fire on his face and on his head. He is fury. He yells when Cody must keep quiet. He is pain when Cody must tuck his away.</p>\n<p>He is a medic and suddenly everything makes more sense. </p>\n<p>Medics are an anomaly. They are part of a battalion and yet they are beyond it. The chain of command exists, and they exist outside of it. They obey their general until they don\u2019t and then their general must obey them. </p>\n<p>Of course, Kenobi is a medic. </p>\n<p>Who else could unleash a scolding on Cody\u2019s general and get away with it?</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Medics are an anomaly, but Kenobi is an anomaly amongst anomalies. Cody is a commander. He trained with the Prime. He is one of the top commanders in the GAR. He appreciates structure and order. He knows a battalion falls apart without it.</p>\n<p>Kenobi disrupts the order.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t escape Cody\u2019s notice that the 212th is the only battalion with a Jedi medic. It doesn\u2019t escape Fizz\u2019s notice either. Fizz is the 212th\u2019s chief medic. Or, he\u2019s supposed to be? Because there is a Jedi who is not supposed to be here, and Fizz doesn\u2019t know where the Jedi fits. Fizz doesn\u2019t know where he fits.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Cody\u2019s responsibility to figure it out. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to think about it, because there is Kamino and then there is Geonosis and then they are mobilizing for their first campaign while still grieving for their first battle.</p>\n<p>Cody has men to learn the names and strengths of, he has a general to learn, and a secondary general to become acquainted with. Handling interpersonal relationships fall to the side. </p>\n<p>Until they\u2019re two days out from their destination, and Cody finally has a moment to breathe. He allows himself one breath without worry or thoughts, and then he takes action.</p>\n<p>\u201cMedic Kenobi,\u201d Cody greets. </p>\n<p>Kenobi eats in the commissary with the vode. It makes him easy to find, and Cody stands next to Kenobi\u2019s seat and waits for acknowledgement. Like the other Jedi Cody has met, Kenobi wears impractical robes. It\u2019s too many layers and none of them useful. He wants his Jedi to at least wear armorweave if they insist on going without armor itself. </p>\n<p>\u201cCommander Cody.\u201d Kenobi smiles at him. He\u2019s made an effort to learn the men\u2019s names. Once he knows a name, he uses it. Cody\u2019s heard scuttlebutt that says he\u2019s never forgotten one. Cody should advise him that there is no space for compassion in war. \u201cHow may I be of assistance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any skill with mechanics? The caf machine in the med-bay is broken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBroken?\u201d Kenobi abandons his tray as if there\u2019s an injured vod in the med-bay, not a broken machine. \u201cAnd there hasn\u2019t been a riot yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody gives Kenobi a look that he hopes conveys that he would never allow something like <em>a riot</em> to take place on his ship. Kenobi\u2019s lips twitch in a smile, as if he understands. Kenobi returns his tray to the kitchen and then falls into step next to Cody as they cross the ship to the med-bay.</p>\n<p>Discreetly, Cody examines the man next to him. Like General Jinn and General Skywalker, Kenobi has a lightsaber clipped to his belt. Are medics trained like generals? He knows Fizz is more than capable with a blaster. It would make sense for Jedi to cross-train as well. </p>\n<p>Rumor has it that General Skywalker and General Jinn battled Count Dooku on Geonosis. It\u2019s how General Skywalker lost his arm and, from what Cody picked up from Kenobi\u2019s anger, General Jinn was injured as well. </p>\n<p>If Kenobi intends to be boots on the ground with the 212th, Cody will have to evaluate his combat skills. Is there a polite way to put a Jedi through a competency exam?</p>\n<p>The doors to the med-bay slide open to welcome them. Kenobi goes straight for the break room to examine the caf machine. Fizz, who had been sitting behind the console near the entrance to the room, looks at Cody with something close to betrayal.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeak with him,\u201d Cody says. Communication could have solved this problem from the beginning, but Kenobi is difficult to pin down. He sits in the commissary long enough to eat, but he doesn\u2019t linger much longer than that. </p>\n<p>And when he\u2019s in the med-bay, he has his own room. Fizz says it\u2019s some kind of research lab. He\u2019s jealous and bitter at the same time. When Kenobi isn\u2019t attending to his own basic needs or attending to the patients they already have, he is in the lab. But now, Cody has brought him to Fizz. </p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Fizz hisses. He looks toward the break room as if Kenobi will overhear them.</p>\n<p>Kenobi comes out a moment later. He looks from Fizz to Cody and then raises his eyebrows. \u201cThe caf machine is missing a screw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow strange,\u201d Cody says. He pulls the small metal screw from one of the pouches on his belt. \u201cI have it right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Kenobi holds out a hand and the screw tugs itself free from Cody\u2019s fingers and floats into Kenobi\u2019s waiting palm. He looks between Cody and Fizz again before he returns to the break room.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you looking to be decommissioned?\u201d Fizz demands.</p>\n<p>Cody waits, patiently. After another few minutes, Kenobi pokes his head out of the room. \u201cAre you going to join me? Both of you, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz gives Cody what would have been a threatening look if Cody hadn\u2019t been raised by Alpha-17, the Prime, and an assortment of bounty hunters. When they join Kenobi in the break room, there are three cups of caf at three of the chairs. None of the chairs are situated as to have the seated individual leave their back to the door. </p>\n<p>So, Kenobi has good observational skills. Or he knows what to expect from men trained for war. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you like to discuss?\u201d Kenobi asks. He looks at Cody, but Cody remains blank-faced, because he isn\u2019t here to talk. Kenobi\u2019s gaze slides to Fizz. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are my failings?\u201d Fizz asks. He tips his chin up, but it\u2019s false bravado, and if Cody can see through it, he suspects Kenobi can as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour failings?\u201d Kenobi\u2019s puzzlement rings true. \u201cWhy do you think you have failed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo other battalion has a Jedi medic assigned to them,\u201d Fizz says. \u201cI had the best scores on Kamino. I was hand-chosen for this assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi stares long enough that Cody\u2019s feelings the first twinges of discomfort. And then he swears, sharply, in <em>Mando\u2019a</em>, which catches Cody off guard. Kenobi rubs his forehead and looks less like a Jedi and more like a human. \u201cWe\u2019re moving so quickly we can\u2019t even communicate. And the war is only at its start.\u201d He shakes himself as if he\u2019d been speaking his thoughts without meaning to. \u201cI apologize, Medic Fizz. I was not assigned here because of any failing of you or any of the other medics assigned to the 212th. What do you know about your general?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHumanoid,\u201d Fizz says. \u201cExiting his prime age and entering his middle age. His physical activity is restricted due to damage to his left lung and a minor heart issue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi scoffs. \u201c<em>Minor heart issue</em>? Is that what they\u2019re calling it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz straightens up as if he recognizes Kenobi as an ally, not an enemy. \u201cDo you know more than what is in his public file, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi waves off the title. \u201cI\u2019m not a sir. And what do you mean, his public file? You are the head medic, and they gave you General Jinn\u2019s public file?\u201d Kenobi swears again, and it\u2019s definitely Mando\u2019a. He runs a hand through his hair, still the color of fire, still bright amongst the neutral grays and blues of the starship. \u201cGeneral Jinn battled the Sith known as Darth Maul on Naboo. During the course of the fight, he was injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi\u2019s gaze is somewhere above Cody and Fizz. There\u2019s a blankness in his eyes and a flatness to his tone, as if he\u2019s reciting facts. It\u2019s a strategy Cody has used when trying to mask his feelings. He is a soldier, he can give a report. </p>\n<p>\u201cHis left lung was punctured by a lightsaber,\u201d Kenobi says. \u201cThe shock to his body disrupted his cardiovascular system. The only reason he is alive is because I was close enough to reach him before his injuries claimed his life. I\u2014\u201d Kenobi purses his lips. \u201cI won\u2019t bore you with the details. I stabilized Mast\u2014General Jinn. He entered a healing trance. After three months, his body could support exiting the healing trance. It took a year of conscious recovery and physical therapy for him to be approved for missions again. But he will be on restricted duty for the rest of his life. His lung capacity is reduced and when he\u2019s under great physical stress, he experiences cardiac arrhythmia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe what?\u201d Fizz demands flatly.</p>\n<p>Kenobi drains the rest of his caf. Cody starts a second pot, because he has a feeling they\u2019ll need it.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo address an earlier point, the 212th is the only battalion to have a Jedi healer, because it\u2019s the only battalion led by a general who needs one.\u201d Kenobi pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cIf I had my way, General Jinn would not be on the frontlines of this war. Since he is, I am here as well. I am not here because there is something deficient with you or the other medics. And I\u2019m not here, because I\u2019m the only one who can treat him. I\u2019m here, because the Council didn\u2019t want another lecture from me, and because I have a better chance at stopping General Jinn from overextending his limits than anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it together,\u201d Fizz says. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The night cycle before they\u2019re expected to reach their destination, Cody finds Medic Kenobi standing by one of the star ports. He stares out into space as if there\u2019s something heavy weighing on his mind. </p>\n<p>Cody stands next to him but doesn\u2019t speak. He\u2019s available but he won\u2019t push. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou and your brothers were raised for war,\u201d Kenobi says. \u201cWas Geonosis your first exposure?\u201d</p>\n<p>They weren\u2019t only raised for war, they were bred for it. Two million clones crafted into soldiers. There was one exception, Boba. He was the Prime\u2019s favorite. He was special. He wasn\u2019t given to the Jedi. Cody heard rumors he was on Geonosis. He wonders if Kenobi knows what happened to the kid. And then he remembers Kenobi asked him a question. \u201cOutside of sims, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s different when it\u2019s real.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody nods. \u201cIt is.\u201d They were pushed hard in their simulations, and he lost brothers on Kamino, but it was nothing like Geonosis. There was still the thin veil of safety and home. Geonosis was death. There were no second chances. There was no ending the sim. </p>\n<p>He thought he was ready.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be ready,\u201d Kenobi says, as if he plucked the thought from Cody\u2019s mind. \u201cI went to my first warzone when I was thirteen. Most of my patients were younger than I was. It was\u2014\u201d Kenobi blinks back tears. \u201cIt was the worst thing I have ever experienced. It didn\u2019t make it better when I went to my next warzone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi doesn\u2019t need to be comforted like a shiny, but Cody is tempted to rest a hand on his shoulder anyway. He falls into parade rest, instead. \u201cWe were made for this. We won\u2019t disappoint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMade for this,\u201d Kenobi murmurs as if speaking to himself. \u201cYou were, weren\u2019t you. You are a solution to a problem the Republic didn\u2019t know it was going to have. Which does, of course, beg the question. Who knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d Cody asks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a sign of Kenobi\u2019s distraction that he doesn\u2019t brush off the title. \u201cSomeone had to know. But who sees a war coming and builds an army instead of trying to deescalate the situation? Who knew about the Separatists and the droid factories? Who knew about Kamino? And why didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody leaves Kenobi to his thoughts, but he makes a mental note to do some investigating of his own. He and his brothers were raised for war. They were made for the Jedi. So why, then, were the Jedi so surprised to see them?</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Cody stands at his general\u2019s side, his expression carefully neutral as Kenobi and his general\u2026discuss the deployment plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the medic. You belong in the med-bay,\u201d General Jinn says.</p>\n<p>Kenobi\u2019s expression is as placid as Cody\u2019s, and his tone is artificially light as he says, \u201cI am a medic, and my place is with my battalion. If this campaign is being conducted on the planet, then I will be on-planet as well. This is non-negotiable.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Jinn sucks in a breath, but he waves his hand in agreement. \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t see much of Kenobi during the campaign. Cody is on the ground, at General Jinn\u2019s side or leading strike forces. Kenobi remains at base camp with the med-tent. </p>\n<p>When Cody\u2019s at base camp, it\u2019s to grab something in the mess or to fall face first onto his cot. He doesn\u2019t spend much time in the med-tent, and Kenobi rarely spends any time outside of it. According to Fizz, Kenobi contributes just as much, if not more, than any other medic. He can do things with the Force the vode can\u2019t, but he doesn\u2019t shy away from tasks like cleaning bedpans or restocking supplies. </p>\n<p>The few times Cody does see him, Kenobi looks\u2026odd. Bulkier, somehow. He\u2019s still in his Jedi robes, even though they billow and get in the way of fighting. But there\u2019s something about him that isn\u2019t the same as when they\u2019re on The Negotiator. No, Cody shouldn\u2019t call their ship that. The name isn\u2019t official.</p>\n<p>It was submitted as a joke, after the third time Kenobi had politely told General Jinn that something was non-negotiable. </p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t like that they went into their first battle with their ship unnamed. If it\u2019s bad luck for shinies to go into battle without a name, surely it\u2019s the same for a starship. </p>\n<p>Tonight, Cody doesn\u2019t look for Kenobi. In fact, he avoids the med-tent entirely. Their latest push had been\u2026disastrous might be too light a word to describe it. Their losses were heavy, and they hadn\u2019t even gained much ground. </p>\n<p>Waxer joins Cody on the ridge. He sits down next to him and stares out at where they can see the flash of a firefight in the distance. Cody turns to fix Waxer with a hard look. He didn\u2019t come out here alone for the company.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, Commander,\u201d Waxer says. </p>\n<p>Cody\u2019s too weary for panic. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKenobi took a squad to the canyon. General Jinn cleared it, and it was volunteers-only, but I wanted you to hear it from me or the general personally. He\u2014\u201d Waxer hesitates. \u201cKenobi said he could still feel some of the vode in the Force.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to retreat,\u201d Cody says. It was the only way to make sure they all didn\u2019t end up dead. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s questioning you or General Jinn\u2019s orders,\u201d Waxer says. \u201cBut if Kenobi can bring even one of them home, it\u2019s worth him going, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Cody bows his head. \u201cI should catch some sleep. Wake me if there are any developments.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t need Waxer to wake him. He wakes at dawn, and he exits his tent in time to see the slow procession of men into camp. Some of them are limping, some of them are barely dragging themselves forward, and some are relying on the help of others, but there are far more than the squad Kenobi set out with. </p>\n<p>Kenobi himself leads the procession. He looks as exhausted as the ones who had been in yesterday\u2019s battle. He staggers forward and gratefully slumps into General Jinn\u2019s arms. The general seems surprised at first, but his expression softens into something close to fond.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d General Jinn says. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>As General Jinn half-escorts, half-carries Kenobi toward the officers\u2019 tent, Cody steps up to herd his vode to the med-tent. </p>\n<p>He catches one of his vod, a shiny who isn\u2019t shiny anymore, his armor dented and cracked and dirty with soot and blood. His vod tries to jerk back when he realizes who he collapsed on. \u201cSir,\u201d he slurs. </p>\n<p>\u201cAt ease,\u201d Cody says. He helps him into the med-tent and then finds an empty bed for him. </p>\n<p>Fizz and the other medics exclaim at the influx of patients. He knows they\u2019re grateful to see so many alive, even if it will stretch their space and their resources to care for all of them. Knowing there aren\u2019t enough hands for all the patients, Cody helps his vod remove his armor. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, verd?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHopper, sir.\u201d He winces at the light in the tent. \u201cTook a hit to the bucket, and I was out cold. Woke up and I was surrounded by bodies.\u201d He swallows thickly. \u201cAnd then our baar\u2019ur arrived. He healed them, sir. Vode with shrapnel in their backs and rocks crushing their legs. He healed them enough to walk back. Clash is still there, sir. Baar\u2019ur said he\u2019s returning as soon as he\u2019s rested enough. We can\u2019t let the Seppies advance. Not until baar\u2019ur\u2019s brought our vode home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Cody says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hopper grabs Cody\u2019s wrist. \u201cI mean it. We have to hold the line. They trust us to come back for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Cody says, softer this time. He runs a hand over Hopper\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll coordinate with the general. You be good for Fizz and his team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that an order, sir?\u201d Hopper smiles, lop-sided, and already drifting off.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody leaves the med-tent and enters the command tent. He isn\u2019t surprised to see Waxer already there or for General Jinn to join a moment later. Cody points to the map. \u201cI know how we can defend the canyon.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>By the end of the campaign, the 212th has a new squad, the Baar\u2019ur Squad. They go out, after a battle, and search for survivors. They can\u2019t save everyone, but they care enough to try, and it gives Cody hope that this war can be won, and that he won\u2019t lose all of his vode along the way.</p>\n<p>Rex hurries to the training room and hopes there will still be a good place left to watch the fight. Skywalker stuck him with a bunch of paperwork and then disappeared to prepare for his spar. And while the general can get away with shirking his administrative duties, Rex can\u2019t. </p>\n<p>The training room is packed with vode from the 212th and the 501st. The two battalions spend a fair amount of time together, because of the relationship between their two generals. Rex appreciates the opportunity to see Cody in person, even if the commander puts Rex through his paces like they\u2019re still on Kamino. </p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t a vode tournament that has everyone gathered here, though. General Jinn arranged a spar between Rex\u2019s general and Cody\u2019s baar\u2019ur. Rex didn\u2019t even realize Kenobi carried a lightsaber, let alone knows how to use it. </p>\n<p>Rex elbows his way through the crowd until he finds Cody. Maybe it\u2019s an abuse of privilege to claim the spot next to him, but Rex earned his captaincy, and there are so few damn perks in this war, he\u2019ll take whatever ones he can find.</p>\n<p>Cody stands with perfect posture, as stiff as a fucking corpse. Most people would look at him and see a dignified commander. Rex knows better. Cody falls back on regs when he doesn\u2019t want to show what he\u2019s thinking. Normally, he\u2019s hiding anger, but Rex thinks he detects a bit of worry hidden behind Cody\u2019s carefully blank face. </p>\n<p>It makes sense. Rex\u2019s general is something else, and that isn\u2019t a biased opinion. In terms of raw power, Rex isn\u2019t sure he\u2019s seen a Jedi stronger than his general. He\u2019s heard the stories about the Baar\u2019ur Squad. Kenobi has guts and he has honor, but those don\u2019t make someone a duelist.</p>\n<p>Cody clenches and unclenches his fists as if he wishes he has his blasters on him. As if he wishes he could step in for his baar\u2019ur. </p>\n<p>There is friendly competition between the 212th and the 501st. They pit themselves against each other, brag about their kill counts, brag about their Jedi, anything and everything is fair game. But this feels wrong. Rex doesn\u2019t have anything against an easy victory, the war has taught him to appreciate wins no matter how they happen, but Cody\u2019s distress is leaking everywhere like he\u2019s the Force sensitive one. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him use it,\u201d Cody says quietly, as Kenobi unclips his saber from his belt. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t miss with a blaster.\u201d A vod Rex doesn\u2019t recognize comes to stand on the other side of Cody. He gives Rex a two-fingered wave. \u201cShortstack. I\u2019m part of the Baar\u2019ur Squad. His aim would make any sniper proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you seen him use the saber?\u201d Rex asks.</p>\n<p>Shortstack shakes his head. \u201cWe do stealth missions and recovery. A glowing light stick isn\u2019t very subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody clenches his jaw this time and Rex swears he hears his teeth grind together.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t carry it if he didn\u2019t know how to use it,\u201d Rex reasons.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a punishment?\u201d Shortstack asks. \u201cGeneral Jinn was ticked off after Baar\u2019ur put him on bedrest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think this is a public humiliation?\u201d Rex asks. </p>\n<p>Shortstack doesn\u2019t answer, but his eyes do narrow as if he\u2019s contemplating a response if it is. Rex leaves him to his revenge fantasies knowing they\u2019ll only ever be that. Cody might have a soft spot a dozen kliks wide for Kenobi, but General Jinn is his general. If he ordered Cody to wipe the floor with Kenobi, Cody would do it. </p>\n<p>Like a good fucking soldier. </p>\n<p>Rex schools his face into something less mutinous. If Cody wasn\u2019t so preoccupied, he would have already called Rex out on his expression. Cody has a sixth sense for vode who doubt their generals or their mission, and he gives them no leeway. </p>\n<p>They were made for the Jedi.</p>\n<p>But does that mean the Jedi can do no wrong?</p>\n<p>Cody elbows Rex sharply in the gut. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sir,\u201d Rex mutters. Busted. </p>\n<p>He redirects his attention to the two Jedi standing in the sparring ring. Kenobi is finishing a series of stretches which show off a surprising flexibility, but there\u2019s nothing intimidating about being able to do a split. Well, Rex\u2019s balls want to climb up into his body because that looks like it hurts, but Skywalker is unimpressed. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go easy on you,\u201d Skywalker promises, jovial as he finishes his own warm-up. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give you a lollipop afterward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLollipops are for visits to the med-bay,\u201d Kenobi responds. \u201cShould I be worried at how much damage you\u2019re intending to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Skywalker loses his teasing smile. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, Obi-Wan. This is a friendly spar.\u201d Skywalker glances at General Jinn as if looking for confirmation.</p>\n<p>Kenobi follows his gaze and huffs at the sight of General Jinn standing as he watches them. \u201cWill someone please get General Jinn a chair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a chair,\u201d General Jinn says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t need to spar with Anakin,\u201d Kenobi responds pleasantly. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silent battle of wills before it\u2019s General Jinn\u2019s turn to huff. He sits in the procured chair. Rex whistles lowly. \u201cYou call your ship <em>The Negotiator</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe never said who we named it after,\u201d Cody says. </p>\n<p>Fizz steps up next to General Jinn. The medic looks irritated, but Rex is pretty sure that\u2019s his default expression. \u201cThis is a friendly spar. Sabers will be set to their lowest setting. The spar ends when a \u201cfatal\u201d wound is landed, when one combatant yields, or when I call the match. Understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Kenobi says. Skywalker echoes him a moment later.</p>\n<p>Fizz waves his hand. \u201cDo your thing, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi chuckles. \u201cDo your thing? Where\u2019s the respect, Fizz? Lightsaber combat is a time-honored\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi doesn\u2019t finish because Skywalker ignites his saber and initiates the attack. Kenobi ignites his own saber in time to block Skywalker\u2019s swing. Their blades crackle as they touch. Kenobi spins away in a graceful movement to disengage. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs I was <em>saying</em>,\u201d Kenobi flicks a mock-irritated look toward Skywalker, \u201cLightsaber combat is a time-honored tradition of the Jedi Order.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the vode groans loudly. \u201cEnd it, please General Skywalker! We didn\u2019t come here for a <em>lecture</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know your voice, Cheeks,\u201d Kenobi says pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019m hurt you don\u2019t at least pretend to share my interests. And that you\u2019re betting against me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m betting on you!\u201d A different vode calls out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Gunner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll haul you to med-bay when it\u2019s over!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi laughs again. \u201cWhere\u2019s your faith, Tank?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Rex asks quietly. Is Kenobi planning to talk Skywalker into submission?</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no fucking clue,\u201d Cody answers. He\u2019s practically vibrating with the effort to contain his fury, and Rex bets half of it is not knowing what\u2019s going on and the other half is his worry for his baar\u2019ur. </p>\n<p>Skywalker doesn\u2019t have the patience for the conversation, and he charges again. The first time, Skywalker had held back, because Kenobi had been talking. It was a gentle start to the spar. This second pass isn\u2019t a full-out attack, but there\u2019s more behind it.</p>\n<p>Once again, Kenobi meets Skywalker\u2019s blade. The first swing, the second, and then the follow-through. </p>\n<p>Surprise trickles through the room. Rex hadn\u2019t expected Kenobi to go down in the first minute, but he hasn\u2019t even shown weakness yet. </p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, I have to concede you had a point,\u201d Kenobi says. He looks to General Jinn long enough to make it clear who he\u2019s talking to before he focuses on Skywalker again. \u201cThey all think I carry a saber for the aesthetic.\u201d </p>\n<p>Kenobi\u2019s in Jedi robes, but Rex can see the high collar of the vode blacks underneath it. He has a neatly trimmed beard and his hair, quite long, is pulled into a topknot to keep it out of his face during the fight. Rex isn\u2019t sure anyone has ever looked at Kenobi and thought, yes, he dresses this way for <em>the aesthetic</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cTake this seriously!\u201d Skywalker demands. He attacks with aggression and it lends even more power to his moves. </p>\n<p>Rex winces as Kenobi blocks and defends. He knows from experience how much of an impact Skywalker can pack when he wants to. But Kenobi doesn\u2019t buckle. He doesn\u2019t even seem to be straining as he counters every powerful strike. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Rex asks Cody. </p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t answer, because Skywalker darts in and out, trying to break through Kenobi\u2019s guard and then he does one of his fancy flips. He should land a blow to Kenobi\u2019s exposed back, but Kenobi\u2019s saber is there to meet the strike before it can land.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck?\u201d Rex asks. </p>\n<p>Rex has seen his general on the battlefield. He is like a storm on Kamino, one of the bad ones where the entire building shook and every roll of thunder made Rex vibrate in his boots. Skywalker is a whirlwind, and he cuts swaths through droids as if they\u2019re flimsi. But against Kenobi, there\u2019s no opening. Every time Skywalker thinks he has one, Kenobi stymies him. </p>\n<p>Rex hasn\u2019t seen a Jedi fight like this before. He\u2019s been on enough joint missions with the 212th to understand General Jinn\u2019s style. And every vode reviewed the footage from Geonosis to see how the Jedi fought. But Kenobi didn\u2019t fight on Geonosis and none of the other Jedi did <em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealer Kenobi is a student of Soresu,\u201d General Jinn explains for the benefit of the vode as Kenobi and Skywalker continue to circle each other. \u201cIt\u2019s known for being the most defensive of the lightsaber forms. I once witnessed Healer Kenobi hold his own against an older, more experienced opponent for hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHours?\u201d Rex echoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cody says softly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Kenobi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex waits but Cody doesn\u2019t expand on his thoughts. After another ten minutes, Rex doesn\u2019t need him to, because he sees it too. They\u2019re not even half an hour in, and Rex\u2019s general is slipping. This isn\u2019t a training exercise for Kenobi, it\u2019s for <em>Skywalker</em>.</p>\n<p>Kenobi defends against Skywalker\u2019s onslaughts without tiring. With each rebuff, Skywalker grows more manic. He becomes more powerful, but he also gets sloppy. He enters a combo which Rex has seen devastate droid ranks at the end. Rex isn\u2019t sure what it will do to Kenobi.</p>\n<p>When Skywalker brings his saber down with all the accumulated force of his attack, Kenobi meets it, and then he slides out from underneath it. Skywalker stumbles forward, carried by the momentum, and Kenobi holds the tip of his saber at Skywalker\u2019s throat. </p>\n<p>\u201cI yield,\u201d Skywalker says.</p>\n<p>Kenobi powers down his saber. He offers his hand to Skywalker. Rex holds his breath and wills his general to set his pride aside. After a long moment, Skywalker clasps Kenobi\u2019s hand and allows Kenobi to pull him to his feet. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood match,\u201d Skywalker says tersely and then he strides out of the room. </p>\n<p>Kenobi turns on his heels to give General Jinn a significant look and then he follows Skywalker out. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Rex\u2019s general is young. It doesn\u2019t bother Rex as much as maybe it should. Rex is also young, and yeah, Skywalker is impulsive and his first reaction is usually to blow things up, but Rex understands that. They\u2019re well-matched.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s why he knows whatever shit General Jinn just pulled wasn\u2019t helpful. </p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t his place to correct a general, though, so he follows Cody out of the training room. They get caught in the throng for a bit, and they listen to the vode gossip about the fight. There\u2019s a lot of awe for Skywalker, because he\u2019s always impressive to watch. But there\u2019s just as much for Kenobi. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur Squad smugly brags about their squad leader until a few fights break out as the vode decide to settle who\u2019s best amongst themselves rather than comparing Jedi. </p>\n<p>Cody escapes to the Officers\u2019 Lounge. Rex tags along. Once they\u2019re inside with the door closed, Cody exhales slowly. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat was fucked up,\u201d Rex says as he goes to make a cup of caf for each of them. \u201cI don\u2019t know how good Kenobi actually is, but his strength is Skywalker\u2019s weakness. It was a lopsided match.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Jinn said Baar\u2019ur can spar for hours,\u201d Cody says. </p>\n<p>Rex doesn\u2019t comment on the name. It doesn\u2019t surprise him that the 212th have adopted Kenobi as one of their own, but he is surprised Cody has as well. Cody likes his regulations and his rules, everything to be in a careful, precise order. Folding a Jedi into the vode? That isn\u2019t nice and neat. But a Jedi who goes out and brings as many vode back after battle as he can? Rex understands where the loyalty comes from.</p>\n<p>When Rex brings over the caf, he nudges Cody away from the console. \u201cI\u2019m not as good as Fives, but I\u2019m not bad. Let me look.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex connects to the Archives. He sifts through the publicly accessible material. It takes some time, but he figures out the Temple hosts, or at least used to host, Jedi tournaments. It\u2019s something the vode did on Kamino, both friendly and a competition at the same time. </p>\n<p>There are records of the tournaments and there\u2019s even video of some of the more infamous ones. The file Rex wants is locked. After a moment, he realizes why.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d Rex turns the screen toward Cody. Under the date of the tournament took place, there are the combatants: <em>Master Yan Dooku versus Padawan Kenobi</em>. If the holonet knew there was footage of a baby Jedi fighting the Separatist General\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cPadawan?\u201d Cody asks. He does a bit of investigating of his own. He looks at Kenobi\u2019s birth year and then the date of the tournament. \u201cHe fought Dooku at fifteen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex submits a request to the Temple Archives for permission to view the video. Part of it is curiosity. Part of it is strategy. Count Dooku has given them trouble since he was revealed to be on the side of the Separatists. Maybe Kenobi\u2019s fight has some kind of weakness they can exploit.</p>\n<p>The other videos aren\u2019t locked so Rex and Cody sip their caf and watch the Jedi compete against each other. They\u2019re so engrossed in their video, they call out a distracted greeting when the doors open but don\u2019t turn to see who it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014oh.\u201d Kenobi sounds puzzled as he leans over their shoulders to see the screen. \u201cOld tournament videos?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t in very many of them,\u201d Cody says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fighter,\u201d Kenobi says. He lifts Cody\u2019s cup off the table and makes another pot of caf. \u201cI only entered if my friends bugged me enough or if Councilor Windu suggested it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Windu?\u201d Cody turns in his chair to look over at Kenobi. \u201cI thought you trained with the healers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex will go to his grave with this, but Cody\u2019s adorable when he\u2019s confused. His forehead scrunches like he\u2019s offended there\u2019s knowledge out in the world that he doesn\u2019t know. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe Jedi are a community,\u201d Kenobi says. He pours himself a cup of caf and refills Cody\u2019s. He hands Cody his cup back and then joins them at the table. \u201cHealer Che taught me we\u2019re at our best when we work together. I would not be the healer I am without her. But saber work isn\u2019t her strength, so she had me learn from our battlemaster as well as Councilor Windu.\u201d Kenobi smiles at some distant memory. \u201cI\u2019m proficient with Soresu. Councilor Windu challenged me to learn some more offensively-minded forms so I was well-rounded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ll train General Skywalker?\u201d Rex asks, trying to understand. </p>\n<p>Kenobi\u2019s lips press together in a frown. He tries to cover for it by sipping his drink, but Rex noticed. And if Rex noticed, Cody certainly did as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe role of a teacher is to know when something is beneficial and when it isn\u2019t,\u201d Kenobi finally says. \u201cDid you ever train your brothers?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen, you know. There is a certain amount of diversity needed in training so there are no obvious gaps. But there is also a certain amount of specialization. Anakin will never be defensively-minded. It\u2019s best for him to lean into his strengths. For me to train him in Soresu would be an exercise in frustration. For both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex can\u2019t help but notice the way Kenobi\u2019s expression softens when he says Skywalker\u2019s name. Or that he calls Skywalker by his first name. \u201cYou know him.\u201d And then, before Kenobi can deflect, \u201cWell. You know him well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI met Anakin when he first came to the Temple.\u201d Kenobi sips his caf as he determines how much he\u2019s going to share. \u201cI\u2019m older than him, enough that friendship isn\u2019t natural. I see him as something like a younger brother, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never sparred with him before,\u201d Cody says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t ask the healers for a spar.\u201d Kenobi grins and the smile reaches high enough to light up his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of relationship we have. Anakin\u2019s journey has been a bit unorthodox. I\u2019ve tried to support him as best I can. Today was a misstep. I didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d have such a large audience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your decision,\u201d Cody says, loyal as always. Rex, because he\u2019s self-aware, can recognize that he\u2019s jealous. He knows what it\u2019s like to be found worthy by Cody. He still remembers the first time Cody hauled him off the ground and promised to help Rex train until no one would look at his hair, only his performance scores. </p>\n<p>Like all of the vode, Cody is a mean son of a bitch, and he\u2019s difficult as fuck to please, but once you\u2019re on his good side, you\u2019re there. Cody\u2019s loyalty is hard-earned, but it\u2019s worth more than any promotion or commendation Rex has received. He hopes Kenobi realizes what a gift he\u2019s earned. </p>\n<p>\u201cI could have said no,\u201d Kenobi says. He runs a hand through his hair, loose now that the spar is over. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. Anakin and I spoke. He knows it wasn\u2019t a test.\u201d</p>\n<p>The doors open and Skywalker storms into the room. \u201cTell me the truth, was it a test?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi\u2019s smile is bitter. \u201cOr perhaps, he doesn\u2019t. Anakin, it wasn\u2019t a test.\u201d</p>\n<p>If anything, Skywalker\u2019s expression grows darker. \u201cThen it was about Dooku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kenobi asks.</p>\n<p>Next to Rex, Cody curls his hand around his cup of caf. His other hand rests below the table, ready to draw. Years of training make Rex want to respond to the tension and his vod\u2019s reaction, but he doesn\u2019t. This is the Officers\u2019 Lounge. They aren\u2019t shinies brawling at every perceived slight. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour famous fight.\u201d Skywalker\u2019s expression is a riot of emotion. Anger. Embarrassment. And, most prominent, hurt. \u201cYou fought Master Dooku for <em>hours</em>. And you were only a padawan. Was today supposed to be a lesson? A scolding?\u201d Skywalker rubs his prosthetic, the one he gained after his own bout with Count Dooku.</p>\n<p>Rex wasn\u2019t on Geonosis, but he heard about Skywalker\u2019s run-in with the Count. Could the war be over already if Skywalker had struck him down on Geonosis? Rex isn\u2019t sure. But he is sure that his general will lose a few night\u2019s sleep thinking about it and blaming himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnakin, the two fights weren\u2019t similar,\u201d Kenobi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause yours was successful?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi arches his eyebrows. \u201cIf you watch the video, you\u2019ll see that I lost the spar against Master Dooku. And that\u2019s the key difference. I went up against a master of the Order in a friendly spar. I didn\u2019t enter the fight expecting to win. I wanted to see how long I could hold out. He defeated me, because even a mountain cannot stand forever. But you, Anakin. You battled a Sith.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn that fight, no. But you lived which means you have the time to improve. Count Dooku was preparing for this war long before we knew it existed. We\u2019re playing catch-up, but there are more of us. The light will prevail. Have faith in the Force, young one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Skywalker wrinkles his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d He sits next to Kenobi and swipes his caf. Cody nudges his own cup toward Kenobi in response. \u201cI\u2019m a knight now. How come Master Jinn is still\u2014\u201d Skywalker makes a motion with his hand that doesn\u2019t mean anything to Rex but Kenobi nods as if it makes sense to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe will always be your teacher. We spend our lives learning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Skywalker groans and aims a light-hearted kick at Kenobi\u2019s shins. Kenobi lets the hit land. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your prosthetic?\u201d Kenobi asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s mechanical, not organic so it isn\u2019t your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the connection site?\u201d Kenobi asks, unfazed by the outburst. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Skywalker\u2019s expression can only be described as sullen. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome to the med-bay with me so I can look at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I get a lollipop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi laughs as he ushers Skywalker toward the door. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re gone and the door closes behind them, Rex begins counting. Once he reaches five-hundred and one, he looks over at Cody. \u201cThe Jedi aren\u2019t perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s akin to blasphemy.</p>\n<p>If he said it on Kamino, he would be decommissioned.</p>\n<p>Cody isn\u2019t a longneck, but he might punch Rex or assign him punishment work.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t,\u201d Cody says slowly, as if he\u2019s testing the words. \u201cWe were made for them. They need us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, for the war.\u201d Rex went through training. He\u2019s heard it all before.</p>\n<p>Cody shakes his head. \u201cThey need us,\u201d he repeats. </p>\n<p>And then he sits in brooding silence until Rex gives up and leaves.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Rex is back on <em>The Resolute</em> when he receives permission to view the video of Kenobi fighting Dooku. Even though time is precious, he watches the entire thing at normal speed. </p>\n<p>Rex thinks he could watch Skywalker fight every day and still be awed by it. Watching Kenobi is something different. He likened himself to a mountain, steady and sure, and Rex understands the comparison. He defends and deflects and blocks and he doesn\u2019t tire. He isn\u2019t tricked by fancy moves or shaken by powerful strikes. </p>\n<p>He withstands.</p>\n<p>Rex enlists the help of Fives and Echo to download the video so the Jedi can\u2019t revoke his access. And then he breaks it into pieces and begins to watch it in slow motion. Kenobi was right, this is Master Dooku, not Count Dooku, but there are still things to be learned, and Rex will learn them.</p>\n<p>Fizz admits he and Baar\u2019ur had a rocky start, but there is no one he trusts more than his fellow medic. They understand each other. War is hell, too many hurt and not enough hands or supplies to hold them together. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur understands. He fights as hard as any of them to keep the vode living, and he says the Remembrances for the ones they can\u2019t save, and, on the very bad nights, he adds a shot of liquor to his caf. </p>\n<p>When he isn\u2019t with his squad, bringing back survivors or on-shift, he\u2019s in his lab. What had first appeared to be a special privilege given to a Jedi medic has turned out to be something more than Fizz ever could have imagined. </p>\n<p>Fizz is one of the few read into Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side mission. Of the 212th, only Commander Cody also knows. And the only other person Fizz has been told he can discuss this with is General Koon, the one who assisted Baar\u2019ur in gaining the space and equipment he needed. </p>\n<p>The secrecy is so no one can tell Baar\u2019ur to stop. It\u2019s also because Baar\u2019ur doesn\u2019t want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up. He told Fizz, when Fizz was first read in, that hope can inspire, but it also can kill. </p>\n<p>Fizz knows how to keep a secret, and he keeps this one.</p>\n<p>Whenever they have spare time, they spend it in the labs, studying blood samples and console readouts and trying to determine the source of the double-aging and how to reverse it. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur cares. Not only about the war but about the vode. He learns their names and their favorite foods and where they want to visit once the war is over. He keeps them alive now and he researches how to keep them alive after the war. </p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t that the other Jedi don\u2019t care but they\u2019re cold. Fizz thinks it\u2019s to do with their rules about attachment. Baar\u2019ur is warmth. He is fire, starting at the top of his head and spreading all the way down. </p>\n<p>Fizz doesn\u2019t care about lightsabers. All anyone could talk about after Baar\u2019ur\u2019s spar with Skywalker was about how none of them knew. And then some footage circulated of a shiny Baar\u2019ur fighting Master Dooku. Fizz still doesn\u2019t care. Baar\u2019ur can fight, of course he can fight, he\u2019s Mandalorian. But he can also heal, and Fizz cares more about that than anything else.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the other thing. Baar\u2019ur speaks Mando\u2019a. And he wears beskar. Cody frowns at him sometimes, as if he\u2019s trying to figure out why Baar\u2019ur looks bigger sometimes and smaller at others. Fizz figured it out first, but he hasn\u2019t told anyone.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur has armor.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t a full set like the vode. And it isn\u2019t mass-produced, either. He has a few pieces of beskar\u2019gam. Fizz wants to know why. And how. And when. He hasn\u2019t asked. Baar\u2019ur wears his armor under his robes. A Mandalorian in Jedi robes.</p>\n<p>Is he trying to fool himself? </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck!\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz is pulled out of his thoughts at the cursing on his comm. He whirls around the med-tent as if expecting a deluge of vode to pour in. </p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cEmergency Protocol 2.1.12,\u201d a new, measured voice says. It\u2019s Boil. \u201cCode: CC-2224. Authorization: CT-2313.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz feels a rock lodge itself in his stomach. He sits behind the console in the med-tent. The screen flickers and then he sees the barren rock and scraggly scrub that marks this Manda-forsaken planet. </p>\n<p>Emergency Protocol 2.1.12 activates the camera and recorder on a trooper\u2019s helmet and provides the feed to command and medical. It\u2019s done in extreme cases, and Fizz doesn\u2019t want to know why it\u2019s Commander Cody\u2019s helmet being activated. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid I hear what I thought I heard?\u201d Baar\u2019ur hurries over. He looks over Fizz\u2019s shoulder and swears in a combination of Basic and Mando\u2019a as if one language isn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>Commander Cody\u2019s helmet is not on Commander Cody\u2019s head. Fizz knows this, because the helmet is now pointing at Commander Cody, who is slumped against a tent pole, restrained even though the bit of metal piping through his stomach would keep him from moving. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s surrounded by droids who titter over their good fortune. </p>\n<p>\u201cBoil has eyes on him,\u201d Fizz says. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur activates his comm. \u201cBoil, this is Kenobi. Send me your coordinates and hold your position until I\u2019m there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir\u2014\u201d Boil begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s an order,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. He looks at Fizz. \u201cBe ready. I\u2019m bringing him home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, sir,\u201d Fizz says. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Fizz doesn\u2019t believe in the Force the way the Jedi do. He knows they can do things with it, but it\u2019s invisible to him. Fizz believes in Baar\u2019ur, though. He sits by the console and watches the droids taunt Commander Cody. Baar\u2019ur will rescue him. Will bring him here and Fizz will save him.</p>\n<p>And then Boil and the rest of vode with him will blow those droids back to the scrapyard they came from.</p>\n<p>It feels like an interminable wait until the helmet picks up on movement. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur jumps down into the droids\u2019 camp. \u201cHello, there,\u201d he greets. He holds his hands up as if droids care about gestures of peace. Fizz wonders if he\u2019s about to witness the death of a Jedi. \u201cI\u2019m here for my commander. Would you mind handing him over?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is our hostage,\u201d one of the droids says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be if he bleeds out,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. \u201cWill you let me treat him at least?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we have you, we don\u2019t need him,\u201d the droid says. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe can do this peacefully,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says as if it\u2019s possible to negotiate with fucking droids. \u201cOr, I can fight you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The droids chitter as if they\u2019re amused. The spokesdroid speaks again. \u201cThose colors mean you\u2019re a medic.\u201d</p>\n<p>The video is clear enough for Fizz to see the way Baar\u2019ur draws in on himself, preparing to fight. The tension in his body is belied by the easy tone of his voice. \u201cYes, I am a medic. And you\u2019re standing between me and my patient.\u201d Baar\u2019ur\u2019s smile is too sharp to be friendly. \u201cCommander, you have beskar in your veins. You are the foundation that holds strong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Commander Cody blinks blearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus, Commander Cody,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. \u201cYou have beskar in your veins. You are the foundation that holds strong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz can barely make out the shape of Commander Cody\u2019s mouth as he moves around the syllables of beskar. And then Baar\u2019ur throws out his hands, and the camp flies backwards. Droids, tents, charging stations, cannons, they\u2019re thrown backward with the strongest show of the Force that Fizz has ever seen Baar\u2019ur use. </p>\n<p>Tent poles are ripped from the ground, maps scatter, and droids beep in alarm as they go head over foot.</p>\n<p>Commander Cody doesn\u2019t budge.</p>\n<p>Fizz releases a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. And then he leans closer to the screen as the droids regain their footing. Baar\u2019ur charges forward, and he ignites his saber, as he stands over Commander Cody. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow, Boil!\u201d </p>\n<p>Boil and the vode with him fire on the droids. The droids fire back. And in the center, Baar\u2019ur deflects any stray blasterfire away from Commander Cody. Fizz hadn\u2019t been impressed by the spar with Skywalker or the one against Dooku. But this. This holds Fizz\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>The droids are smarter than Fizz wants them to be. Most of them return fire at Boil and his men, but a few aim at Baar\u2019ur and Commander Cody as if they don\u2019t care about hostages anymore, only dealing the most damage to the GAR as they can. </p>\n<p>None of the shots make it through. Baar\u2019ur\u2019s lightsaber is a blur of motion, quick, sweeping arcs which deflect the blasterfire away from himself and Cody even as the droids do their best to slip a shot through his guard. </p>\n<p>Five minutes stretch into ten, into thirty and then sixty. Fizz is glued to his chair as a battle rages between his vode and the clankers. And in the center, holding strong, is Baar\u2019ur.</p>\n<p>Finally, it ends. Fizz sees Boil and the others fan out to make sure the area is clear. But Fizz is certain it is, because Baar\u2019ur powers down his saber and kneels at Commander Cody\u2019s side. He wouldn\u2019t do that if the Force told him there\u2019s still danger nearby.</p>\n<p>There are no witnesses to Baar\u2019ur and Commander Cody except for the helmet. Fizz feels as though he\u2019s intruding on a private moment as Baar\u2019ur calls Commander Cody\u2019s helmet to where they are, but he doesn\u2019t turn off the transmission. There is protocol to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cCommander, stay with me,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says.</p>\n<p>Commander Cody\u2019s skin is unnaturally pale from blood loss. His gaze lands on Baar\u2019ur and then slides away. The rock in Fizz\u2019s stomach grows heavier. He knows these signs. And he knows how far Baar\u2019ur is from camp. </p>\n<p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d Baar\u2019ur repeats, but his voice isn\u2019t firm anymore. He almost sounds like he\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat an order, sir?\u201d Commander Cody slurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. He runs his hands from Commander Cody\u2019s head to his toes, doing the Force scan that Jedi healers can do. \u201cIt\u2019s an order. And I\u2019m the Chief Healer of the Galactic Army of the Republic. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p>\n<p>Commander Cody mumbles something unintelligible. </p>\n<p>\u201cI outrank everyone,\u201d Baar\u2019ur answers. \u201cThat includes you. So, you\u2019re going to stay with me. I\u2019m going to bring you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Commander Cody says.</p>\n<p>Fizz has a hard time swallowing. His throat feels too thick. He turns away from his screen. When he processes the video from Commander Cody\u2019s helmet, he\u2019ll cut the last few minutes. There is protocol, but protocol can go fuck itself. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Commander Cody becomes a grumpy, semi-permanent resident of med-bay. And, because he doesn\u2019t want Baar\u2019ur to think he\u2019s grumpy with him, Commander Cody saves all his asshole behavior for Fizz. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, medics go through tougher training than even the CCs. Commander Cody can be an asshole, but Fizz can dish it right back. </p>\n<p>Currently, Fizz is perched in view of Commander Cody but out of Baar\u2019ur\u2019s line of vision. He watches, eyebrows raised in judgement, as Commander Cody sifts through the jar of lollipops until he finds the one he wants.</p>\n<p>When Baar\u2019ur brought this practice to the med-bay, Fizz understood. The burst of sugar helps with recovery, whether it\u2019s physical recovery or getting over the jitters of being in med-bay. And then Baar\u2019ur shook his head and said the lollipops were for <em>spiritual</em> healing.</p>\n<p>Which is bantha shit. Fizz told him that then, and he still believes it now.</p>\n<p>The fact that Baar\u2019ur and Commander Cody now have a daily ritual of lollipop selection is nausea inducing.</p>\n<p>Fizz isn\u2019t paid enough for this shit. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The war is\u2026going. No one is certain whether they\u2019re winning or not. They\u2019re on their way to rendezvous with the 501st and have a bit of downtime. If recovering from one campaign and preparing for the next can be considered downtime. </p>\n<p>Fizz\u2019s med-bay is nearly empty which isn\u2019t as good as completely empty but is better than full. He skims the latest report Chin-up from the 104th submitted to the medic group chat. They found a plant that can be pressed for a salve which shares a lot of properties with bacta. It\u2019s a natural and much less expensive way to treat wounds. There will be on-ship cultivation centers soon as well as planets dedicated to growing it for the GAR. </p>\n<p>Alderaan and Naboo have both volunteered land and labor to grow the plant. It\u2019s a reminder that they have allies. </p>\n<p>Fizz flips to the next report.</p>\n<p>\u201cFizz?\u201d Baar\u2019ur sticks his head out of his labs. His voice is even, perfectly controlled, which means he\u2019s hiding some kind of reaction. \u201cCould I trouble you for a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrix, the med-bay is yours,\u201d Fizz says, delegating, before he joins Baar\u2019ur in his labs.</p>\n<p>As soon as the doors close, Baar\u2019ur ushers Fizz toward the console. \u201cI found something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz scans the information. \u201cYou figured out how to reverse the advanced aging.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says, almost dismissive. </p>\n<p>Rather than growing offended, Fizz worries. \u201cWhat else did you find?\u201d Because if Baar\u2019ur isn\u2019t throwing a party over reversing the advanced aging, he must have found something bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about how even-keeled the vode are,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. \u201cHow it was odd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost like you\u2019re taking mood stabilizers. But you\u2019re not. Not consciously, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fizz looks back at the console. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur taps a few keys and new information pops up. Chips. There are chips inside the vode\u2019s heads. He heard the longnecks talk about behavior modification and insurance, but he didn\u2019t understand. Now he does. From Baar\u2019ur\u2019s research, these chips release hormones and neurotransmitters to regulate the vode\u2019s behavior and their emotions. </p>\n<p>No, more than that. Fizz knows his anatomy and physiology. It\u2019s how he got his name after all. Phys looked odd so he chose Fizz. Neurophysiology is its own beast, but Fizz was bred to be the best. He knows. He <em>knows</em>.</p>\n<p>Hormones, neurotransmitters, they affect thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger, the whole fucking body. The vode were cloned, they were altered, and then they were grown, and they were trained. Horrifying but it happened.</p>\n<p>The thought of these <em>chips</em> which continue to alter and control them? No. They\u2019re supposed to be their own people now. </p>\n<p>\u201cFizz!\u201d Baar\u2019ur\u2019s voice is sharp and it cuts through Fizz\u2019s panic. \u201cWe discovered the chips. We\u2019re going to get them out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we?\u201d Fizz asks. Someone put them there. The longnecks? Obviously, they put them there but on whose orders? </p>\n<p>\u201cWe are going to gather all the medics and show them how to reverse the rapid aging. And, quietly, we\u2019re going to tell them about the chips. Both procedures will be done at the same time. But this doesn\u2019t go beyond the medics. And we may limit the number of medics who know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSir?\u201d Wouldn\u2019t having more hands on this be better?</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur takes a deep breath. He looks troubled as he glances at the console again. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know who was behind creating you and the vode. And now there are control chips? Something is very, very wrong here. Maybe, it\u2019s the evil of slavery and nonconsensual body modification I\u2019m feeling. But maybe, it\u2019s something else. If someone is controlling you and your brothers for their own reasons, we don\u2019t want to tip our hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz nods. \u201cWe keep it quiet, but we take the chips out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking them out was never in question,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I may make a suggestion? Read Commander Cody into this.\u201d Fizz presses on even as Baar\u2019ur doesn\u2019t look persuaded. \u201cHe deserves to know, and he\u2019ll be able to help us coordinate. This will be difficult to pull off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur shakes his head. \u201cAt best, I\u2019d be asking him to lie to his commanding officer. At worst, I\u2019d be asking him to commit treason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s his choice to make,\u201d Fizz says.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur blanches, no doubt thinking of how many choices the vode haven\u2019t been able to make. How many these chips are preventing them from making. \u201cAlright. Tomorrow evening. Have him meet us in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur looks like shit. His hair is limp and greasy like it hasn\u2019t been washed days. There are dark circles under his eyes like he isn\u2019t sleeping either. He paces the lab like a caged animal, just waiting until it can spring free. </p>\n<p>If Fizz looks in a mirror, he\u2019d probably see that he doesn\u2019t look like a holostar either. </p>\n<p>Commander Cody clears his throat. \u201cBefore we begin, I would like to clear something up. General Jinn is not my commanding officer. As of Zygerria, I outrank him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And wasn\u2019t that hell in a fucking handbasket. Is it bad that Fizz is glad Commander Cody can override General Jinn\u2019s orders? Looking over at Baar\u2019ur, Fizz decides he\u2019s at least in good company. He remembers Baar\u2019ur\u2019s fury that Skywalker, a former slave, was being forced undercover as a slave master.</p>\n<p>Fizz wishes Baar\u2019ur saved some of that fury for his own behalf. Baar\u2019ur hasn\u2019t talked about his own experience on the mission. As far as Fizz knows, Rex hasn\u2019t either. And that\u2019s telling in itself. </p>\n<p>\u201cWas the Council going to tell us?\u201d Baar\u2019ur asks. </p>\n<p>Commander Cody offers a small shrug. \u201cWhen it became relevant, I assume.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur sighs. \u201cCongratulations, Commander. And, apologies. It is a large responsibility, but I can think of no one better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it that you brought me here for?\u201d Commander Cody asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can reverse the accelerated aging,\u201d Baar\u2019ur answers. \u201cWe plan to gather the medics of the other battalions and share our findings and begin the process as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may have to do it in groups but yes.\u201d Commander Cody looks at Baar\u2019ur and then Fizz. \u201cAnd the bad thing you have to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the process of my research\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Fizz cuts Baar\u2019ur off. \u201cThere are chips in our heads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Commander Cody\u2019s face goes terrifying blank. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur takes over again. \u201cFrom what I can tell, they release hormones or neurotransmitters in order to regulate; well, a hell of a lot. Emotions and behavior, primarily. The Kaminoans mentioned something about curbing aggression, but we never looked deeply into it. I think this is what they were referring to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChips,\u201d Commander Cody says. He rubs his forehead and then drops his hand to his side. \u201cAre they dangerous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fizz answers but Commander Cody is looking at Baar\u2019ur, not him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe use hormone treatments and neurotransmitters as part of healing,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. \u201cSerotonin is a neurotransmitter. But these chips\u2014we don\u2019t know who placed them in your heads, we don\u2019t know how they control what is administered and in what doses. In my professional opinion, yes, they are dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you remove them without arousing suspicion?\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, Commander Cody jumps to this question. He listens as Baar\u2019ur gives the same answer he gave Fizz last night. The two of them, Commander Cody and Baar\u2019ur, they understand each other. </p>\n<p>\u201cSecrecy is paramount,\u201d Commander Cody says. \u201cI want the list of medics you plan to meet with. We review and clear them together. I also want reports on when the procedures begin and their progress until they\u2019re completed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have them,\u201d Baar\u2019ur promises. He seems to dither for a moment before he reaches out to rest his hand on Commander Cody\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>Commander Cody\u2019s eyes close and he leans into the touch.</p>\n<p>The Dooku situation is fucked, and Rex knows a thing or two about fucked up situations. </p>\n<p>Dooku trained General Jinn. And General Jinn trained Skywalker which makes them a fucked-up family. Lineage. Whatever.</p>\n<p>Again, Rex knows a thing or two about fucked up families. His father was Jango fucking Fett and even though he\u2019ll have over a million brothers when this damned war is finally over, it won\u2019t be enough because he should have twice that. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard about Geonosis, about how General Jinn tracked the Prime from Coruscant to Kamino and then to Geonosis where he was captured and lightly tortured and taunted by Dooku for a bit. And then Skywalker and Senator Amidala showed up, and they were all slated for execution. War broke out, Skywalker battled Dooku and lost his arm, General Jinn was there and couldn\u2019t deliver the killing blow.</p>\n<p>Dooku escaped.</p>\n<p>And now.</p>\n<p>And now, they have him in their sights.</p>\n<p>Well, Rex and Torrent do. </p>\n<p>The 212th is on the main assault, and the 501st is executing a pincer movement to cut off the enemy and trap them between them. Rex is leading Torrent on a side mission, because they heard there\u2019s a Seppie base where they\u2019ve kept captured vode. Kenobi is with them, because if there are vode here, they\u2019re in rough shape.</p>\n<p>Cody threatened Rex before he entrusted Kenobi with Torrent. It\u2019s been three days, and Rex has finally remembered how to breathe normally so of course Fives comes back to report that not only is there a Seppie base, but the Count himself is currently in residence. </p>\n<p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Kenobi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi pouts as if that expression will sway Rex at all. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even heard it, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCody briefed me before assigning you to Torrent,\u201d Rex says.</p>\n<p>Now, Kenobi sniffs, offended. \u201cI\u2019m <em>loaned</em> to Torrent. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex sighs. \u201cWhat\u2019s your idea?\u201d They don\u2019t have the time for Kenobi to wax poetic about the 212th and how much he loves his battalion or the 212th\u2019s grumpy asshole of a commander. </p>\n<p>\u201cThere are men, good men, in there who need to be freed, but if Dooku notices an escape attempt, he\u2019ll kill them. We need a distraction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fives perks up, the fucking maniac. \u201cExplosives?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA duel,\u201d Kenobi says.</p>\n<p>Everyone swings their attention to Rex as if waiting for him to shut Kenobi down now that he knows what the plan is. Cody did warn Rex to reflexively say no to any suggestion Kenobi made outside of healing matters. He also warned Rex about what would happen to Rex\u2019s dick, balls, and head if anything happened to Kenobi. Specifically, those things would no longer be attached to the rest of his body. </p>\n<p>But\u2026Rex has seen the footage from Kenobi\u2019s first duel with Dooku. He\u2019s studied it more than is probably healthy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a Jedi anymore,\u201d Rex says, because someone has to be the voice of reason. If it\u2019s him, then they\u2019re fucked. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a padawan. I can do this.\u201d Kenobi\u2019s conviction is evident in his voice and in the set of his shoulders. \u201cI can get you the time you need to evacuate our men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd will you be able to safely disengage once we\u2019re clear?\u201d Rex asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Rex says. \u201cThis is the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Rex shadows Kenobi. He follows the baar\u2019ur through the maze-like halls of the base. He stays out of sight as Kenobi saunters into Dooku\u2019s throne room. An actual fucking throne room. What a fucking dramatic piece of shit. </p>\n<p>Count Dooku smirks as he turns to greet Kenobi. \u201cDoes Qui-Gon know you\u2019re here, little one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi scoffs which is good because it saves Rex from having to do it and give away his position. \u201cI\u2019m not a child anymore, Count. And Qui-Gon\u2019s not in charge of me. Perk of being a medic. I\u2019m outside the chain of command.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMedic?\u201d Dooku\u2019s lips curl up as if he\u2019s caught Kenobi doing something wrong. \u201cNot a healer? Why, Obi-Wan, have you changed allegiances?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi unclips his saber. \u201cAre we doing this or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo eager to die. I know my padawan and my grandpadawan are on the planet. Why did they send you instead of them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go so well for them the last time they faced you,\u201d Kenobi answers. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou lost last time we fought,\u201d Dooku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was fifteen. I\u2019ve learned a lot since then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d Dooku ignites his saber and the red blade glows ominously in the room. </p>\n<p>Dooku throws himself at Kenobi. Even with Rex\u2019s enhancements the movement is almost too fast for him to follow. Before he can worry Kenobi won\u2019t react in time, the two sabers clash in a loud grind. </p>\n<p>Kenobi spins away from the Sith, and holds his saber out in front of him, prepared for the next attack. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have learned <em>nothing</em>,\u201d Dooku says and then attacks once more.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Being a Sith has undoubtedly make Dooku stronger but, Rex notes, it makes him more impatient as well. Rex had been impressed by how long Dooku and Kenobi sparred in the Temple video. He isn\u2019t sure this fight will go that long. Dooku doesn\u2019t have the temperament for it anymore. </p>\n<p>Already, he\u2019s thrown various objects at Kenobi using the Force, and he\u2019s even thrown some Force lightning in the Sith-equivalent of a temper tantrum. Kenobi has weathered each challenge, his saber creating a dome of safety that nothing can pierce; not Dooku\u2019s saber, not flying chairs, and not even creepy electricity. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold out forever,\u201d Dooku says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d sound more convincing if you weren\u2019t out of breath,\u201d Kenobi says, as steady now as he had been at the start of the fight. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am a Makashi master! I am an expert in dueling other lightsaber wielders. You can\u2019t expect to win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho ever said I wanted to win?\u201d Kenobi\u2019s smile is bright and a touch unhinged. \u201cHow long have we been dueling, Count? At least an hour, I\u2019d wager.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d The Count\u2019s face twists in rage. \u201cYou were a diversion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA good one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter. You will be a sacrifice. Will the Jedi think it\u2019s a worthy trade? One of their own for a handful of clones?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dooku redoubles his efforts. Rex tracks the two Force users as they move about the room. He can tell Kenobi is tiring. There is something to be said for the sheer, brute force Dooku commands, and as good as Kenobi is, he can\u2019t hold up against the assault forever. </p>\n<p>Fives checks in to tell Rex they\u2019ve extracted all their people, and they\u2019ve rigged the base to explode when they\u2019re ready. Rex wishes he had a good way to signal to Kenobi that they\u2019re clear to disengage but since Kenobi doesn\u2019t know Rex is here\u2026</p>\n<p>It\u2019d be a good time for the Force to do its thing and help communicate. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you give up?\u201d Dooku demands as he batters at Kenobi\u2019s guard, thrust after thrust, each one stronger than the last. \u201cYou cannot defeat me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dooku swings down and Kenobi <em>drops his fucking lightsaber</em> and traps Dooku\u2019s saber between his arms. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t,\u201d Kenobi says.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s when Rex realizes Kenobi\u2019s positioned them so that Rex has a clear shot at Dooku\u2019s back. While Dooku\u2019s saber is pinned and his entire attention is on Kenobi. Fucking Force fucking shit. </p>\n<p>Rex shoots. Three shots to be safe. Head. Chest. Head again.</p>\n<p>Dooku falls to the ground. His saber powers down and the hilt rolls across the floor. Kenobi kneels down and places two fingers against Dooku\u2019s pulse. He looks over at Rex. His face is shiny with sweat. There are holes in his sleeves where Dooku\u2019s saber burned through the fabric and then was stopped by\u2014by beskar.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises,\u201d Rex says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Kenobi grimaces and looks up at Rex. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have another. I\u2019m not entirely certain I can stand on my own. Holding a Sith at bay is more difficult than I anticipated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex rolls his eyes, but he clips Dooku\u2019s saber to his belt and then helps Kenobi to his feet. Kenobi sways alarmingly, and Rex drapes one of Kenobi\u2019s arms over Rex\u2019s shoulders and then he wraps his own arm around Kenobi\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>Together, they stagger out of the base.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re clear of it, Rex gives Fives the go-ahead. He shuffles around so he and Kenobi can watch the base collapse in on itself. </p>\n<p>\u201cDooku\u2019s dead,\u201d Rex says. He took the shot himself. He saw Kenobi check and now there\u2019s the explosion. It still doesn\u2019t feel real.</p>\n<p>Kenobi pats Rex\u2019s cuirass. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t escape promotion this time, Captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Rex says. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Rex leads Torrent to where the 212th and 501st are camped out after their success on the battlefield. They crest the hill with their rescued vode and cheers erupt in response. Rex is glad to smile and accept a few back slaps and then leave the vode to their reunion and celebrating. He slips through the crowd with Kenobi, and they take refuge in the Command Tent. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s only a partial refuge, because General Jinn, Skywalker, and Cody are all there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirs,\u201d Rex greets, because he can be a professional when he tries. He unclips Dooku\u2019s saber and places it on the table. \u201cPrimary mission to retrieve our POWs was a success. Secondary mission to eliminate a major threat was also a success.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Jinn stares at the lightsaber hilt as if it\u2019s speaking to him. Hell, for all Rex knows, it could be. </p>\n<p>\u201cGeneral Dooku is dead?\u201d Cody confirms. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kenobi answers. He attempts to rally and stand on his own, but he ends up against Rex\u2019s side again after only a moment. \u201cCaptain Rex showed initiative and bravery in the field. Additionally, he was responsible for eliminating a Sith and Separatist general. It is my opinion that he should be acknowledged and rewarded for the actions he took today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rex glares at the top of Kenobi\u2019s head, embarrassed and pleased and unsure how to react. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe put you in danger,\u201d Cody says flatly. Rex has a pretty good idea of how Cody wants to \u201creward\u201d him for his actions today. </p>\n<p>\u201cI put me in danger,\u201d Kenobi says. \u201cCaptain Rex got me out of it. Commander, it\u2019s been a trying day. Could I trouble you to help me to my bunk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cody says, far too solicitous. \u201cFizz has a bed already reserved for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kenobi groans but he goes easily enough, shifting from Rex\u2019s side to Cody\u2019s once Cody is in reach. \u201cI\u2019m voluntarily resting. Do you have to push for the med-tent as well? Fizz will scold me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. And once you\u2019re more awake, I will as well.\u201d Cody\u2019s expression softens minutely as he brushes Kenobi\u2019s hair out of his face. And then he glances up and catches Rex\u2019s eyes, and his expression hardens again. </p>\n<p>Rex sighs. Bastard\u2019s going to double-promote him or something in retribution.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou rescued our vode, and you took out a Separatist general,\u201d Cody says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Fuck you</em>, Rex mouths so that General Jinn and Skywalker won\u2019t hear.</p>\n<p>Cody, the bastard, just laughs and then guides Kenobi out of the tent. </p>\n<p>Rex turns back to the generals. \u201cWould you like a full report?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody is there, in the Senate Chambers, when the Jedi Council confronts Chancellor Palpatine. It didn\u2019t make sense, even as the evidence piled up. Security leaks that came from high up. A lack of supplies or back-up at crucial moments. Senator Amidala\u2019s fears, grave enough that she approached Baar\u2019ur. General Skywalker\u2019s slow descent into something dark.</p>\n<p>Except, it <em>did</em> make sense. Each piece of evidence pointed to an obvious conclusion but not one that any of them wanted to believe. </p>\n<p>The Jedi, their generals, they face Chancellor Palpatine, the man behind both armies, the man behind the war, the <em>Sith</em> who has played the galaxy like puppets for his entertainment. </p>\n<p>Cody bears witness as General Windu accuses the Chancellor of crimes against the Republic. Of <em>treason</em>. </p>\n<p>Cody sees the delight on the Sith\u2019s face, and he doesn\u2019t understand. Why create this war? Why orchestrate so much destruction? He already had power. What is there to be gained by ruling over the smoldering ashes of a galaxy? </p>\n<p>\u201cYou fools,\u201d Chancellor Palpatine says, and his voice is a low hiss. Before Cody\u2019s very eyes, he ages, his face developing deep set wrinkles, his shoulders hunching. He becomes something twisted or maybe, they finally see him for what he\u2019s been all along. \u201cBlinded by your precious light.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe in the Force,\u201d General Windu says. \u201cThrough the light, we gain clarity and through unity, we gain strength. We will stand against the darkness, and we will prevail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will fall, and I will grow my new galaxy from your corpses.\u201d</p>\n<p>Charming, Cody thinks. Like the vode around him, he has his blaster out, and is prepared to fire at the order from any of their generals. He isn\u2019t sure how effective blasters will be against a Sith master, but he was made for the Jedi, and the Jedi need him now. </p>\n<p>Palpatine, no <em>Sidious</em>, looks through the force assembled to face him, and his gaze hones in on Cody. He smiles, a sickly impression of an actual smile. \u201cYou weren\u2019t made for the Jedi, CC-2224. You were made for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once, Baar\u2019ur told Cody he has beskar in his veins. Cody allows that belief to fill him. He stands taller, meets Sidious\u2019s gaze evenly, his helmet and all its sensors trained on the Sith. \u201cMy name is Cody.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sidious\u2019s smile twists into something uglier. \u201cApologies, Commander Cody. I suppose I can indulge you in your last moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody\u2019s gaze is on Sidious, but he can see his vode respond in his peripherals. Rex has his blaster trained on Sidious with his finger already on the trigger, prepared to fire. Somewhere in the room is Baar\u2019ur himself, and he brushes his mind against Cody\u2019s, a reminder Cody isn\u2019t alone. </p>\n<p>\u201cCommander, execute Order 66,\u201d Sidious says. </p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t react. </p>\n<p>It clearly isn\u2019t what Sidious expects, because the Sith hisses again. He looks around the assembled vode. \u201cDid you hear me? Execute Order 66!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from Sith,\u201d Cody says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Sidious turns, his gaze searching the crowd. \u201cWhat did you do to my clones?\u201d His gaze lands on someone, and Cody doesn\u2019t need to feel the sinking sensation in his stomach to know which Jedi Sidious has singled out. \u201c<em>You</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t only behavior modifiers,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. There\u2019s muted horror in his words, as if he\u2019s trying not to think through the implications. </p>\n<p>Cody doesn\u2019t have much success holding his thoughts at bay. The chips. Sidious\u2019s order. He isn\u2019t sure what Order 66 was. He doesn\u2019t want to know. All he can feel is relied that the control chips are gone. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter,\u201d Sidious says, recovering. \u201cYou are weak.\u201d He throws out his hands and lightning shoots out.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur leaps in front of the lightning, and he meets the strike with his saber. It\u2019s enough to spur everyone else into action. Cody, Rex, and the ten best men from each of their battalions are here along with four high generals, two regular generals, and Baar\u2019ur. </p>\n<p>It should be overkill, but Sidious swats them aside like they\u2019re nothing. Blaster bolts are deflected into the walls. Lightsaber attacks are pushed back. Sidious holds them off with one hand and attacks with the other. </p>\n<p>Cody holsters his blaster a few minutes into the fighting. It\u2019s more likely that Sidious will guide one of Cody\u2019s shots into a vod or a Jedi than one of them will hit the Sith. With his blaster not an option, Cody signals to his vode. They follow his lead and holster their weapons.</p>\n<p>And then, at his signal, they charge.</p>\n<p>Cody has spent the past three years fighting alongside Jedi. He\u2019s learned a thing or two. They\u2019re powerful. They can do things beyond the ability of a normal sentient. It takes a lot to tire them out. It takes even more to overwhelm them.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s possible.</p>\n<p>Cody and nineteen of his vode rush Sidious. Cody doesn\u2019t expect them all to reach him. He hopes at least one of them will. </p>\n<p>Sidious raises his hands and lightning crackles at his fingertips. Cody doesn\u2019t falter. He draws a blade and throws it, even as he reaches for another. </p>\n<p>Lightning pours out of Sidious\u2019s hands. Cody flinches and it takes him a moment to realize he isn\u2019t hurt. The lightning is channeled upward, a pillar of blue energy that sparks and beats against invisible walls. </p>\n<p>Cody throws another knife. This one hits. Sidious howls, at Cody\u2019s hit or maybe Rex\u2019s or maybe at the way his lightning is contained, directed away from his enemies by Baar\u2019ur. </p>\n<p>Two more strides and Cody will jam a knife into Sidious\u2019s throat. </p>\n<p>Without using his hands, Sidious throws Cody and his vode backward. They fly, boots over bucket, tumbling through the air. He\u2019s caught before he slams into the wall or the ground. He\u2019s lowered gently and looks around to see Plo Koon and some of the other Jedi cushioning his and his vode\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p>Sidious, lightning still pouring from his hands, cackles as he flings Rex through the air again. \u201cThis is the power of the darkside.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Cody can see it. It takes all of Baar\u2019ur\u2019s considerable strength to hold the lightning at bay. It takes four Jedi to keep the vode from shattering against the walls. Sidious doesn\u2019t even look <em>tired</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe darkside is bantha shit,\u201d Cody says, getting to his feet. </p>\n<p>Sidious hisses and tosses him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Rex says, his turn to throw out a jab as he realizes what Cody is doing.</p>\n<p>Distraction.</p>\n<p>Overwhelm him.</p>\n<p>Because it does take Baar\u2019ur to counter the Force lightning. And it does take twenty vode and four generals to keep Sidious\u2019s telekinesis busy. </p>\n<p>But that still leaves two Jedi not accounted for. </p>\n<p>General Skywalker leads a frontal assault while General Windu approaches from behind. Sidious is too busy swatting vode as they stand up to him to notice. Cody\u2019s getting to his feet for the fourth time, slower than the third, as General Windu\u2019s purple blade punctures Sidious\u2019s chest. </p>\n<p>General Skywalker drives his blade through the Sith next.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sidious shouts, somehow still clinging to life. \u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>His screams echo through the chamber, even after General Windu cuts off his head. The air in the chamber constricts, like someone drawing breath, and then it exhales, and it throws everyone in the room backward. </p>\n<p>Cody finally hits the wall, no Jedi available to help this time. His armor takes the brunt of it, but he groans as he, once again, finds his feet. He staggers over to Waxer and offers him his hand. Waxer grips it, and Cody helps pull him to his feet.</p>\n<p>Waxer goes to help Boil, and Cody offers his hand to General Koon. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a black mark on the ground where Sidious\u2019s robes are bunched in a pile. There\u2019s no body.</p>\n<p>Something isn\u2019t right. Cody scans the room. Rex, Waxer, Boil, Koon, Windu, Skywalker\u2014</p>\n<p>His gaze falls to the one figure still on the floor.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur.</p>\n<p>He rushes to Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side. There\u2019s blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. His breathing is shallow, labored, and it stutters like when the power shorts out. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him to the Halls of Healing,\u201d General Windu promises. </p>\n<p>Rex eases Cody back so General Windu and General Skywalker can lift Baar\u2019ur in the air. Cody has seen the power of the Jedi. He has seen miracles.</p>\n<p>He looks at the black spot on the floor and hopes they haven\u2019t used all their miracles up.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Cody sits, vigilant, at Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur is improving, because Cody\u2019s allowed in the room. He used to watch from the outside, haunting the visitor\u2019s room, lurking by the window as the healers did their jobs. But now Cody has a chair. He doesn\u2019t leave the room except to use the fresher. His vode bring him food.</p>\n<p>The war is over and there is nowhere else he needs to be. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d Cody asks, on the second day of his vigil.</p>\n<p>Healer Che is worn down, but she isn\u2019t exhausted anymore. Cody knows better than to bother a medic in the midst of a crisis. But the crisis is over, because the healers don\u2019t rotate in shifts, one of them always at Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side, using their healing powers. </p>\n<p>Cody watched them rotate, each taking turns at Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side, taking turns supporting each other, taking turns resting so they could do it again. Cody didn\u2019t speak up then, but he speaks up now. </p>\n<p>\u201cBaar\u2019ur says the Force is in all things,\u201d Cody explains and he feels foolish, a bit like a shiny who makes the mistake of talking to a superior officer, but this is Baar\u2019ur. He can weather a bit of humiliation. \u201cIf the Force is in me, you can use it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Healer Che says, and Cody can feel when she understands what he\u2019s trying to ask. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. But there is something. Stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody raises his eyebrows, but he doesn\u2019t speak. Where else has he been since he was allowed entry? </p>\n<p>Healer Che returns with a rock. It\u2019s a glowing rock, but it\u2019s still a rock. Cody isn\u2019t sure how this is supposed to help, but she places it on the round table at Cody\u2019s left. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a healing crystal,\u201d Healer Che says. \u201cIt can pass through thoughts, emotions, maybe even faint memories. Obi-Wan has a long fight ahead of him.\u201d She runs her hand through Obi-Wan\u2019s hair, and there\u2019s a wealth of fondness in the touch. \u201cYou can help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody looks at the rock. Crystal. He doesn\u2019t completely understand Jedi and their ways. But if Baar\u2019ur is stuck in his own mind while he heals, if he\u2019s aware but trapped. Cody swallows back his instinctual fear at the thought of being trapped anywhere, let alone his own mind. </p>\n<p>\u201cClear your mind,\u201d Healer Che counsels. \u201cOnly touch the crystal if you can pass on positive emotions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Cody promises. </p>\n<p>Cody closes his eyes. He thinks about Baar\u2019ur standing in a med-tent, chaos around him. That was his frontline. While Cody learned to filter out distractions as clankers fired on them, Baar\u2019ur filtered out cries of pain and pleas for help until he could identify where he was needed most.</p>\n<p>Safety.</p>\n<p>Comfort.</p>\n<p>Hope.</p>\n<p>Cody thinks of all these things and curls his fingers around the crystal. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Rex comes by with a tray of food. Cody explains the crystal to him, and Rex looks at it curiously, before he shrugs and sits down on the other side of the table. He touches the crystal while Cody eats. </p>\n<p>Fizz comes by, and he complains about Jedi and their magic and invisible healing, but he wraps both hands around the crystal and stays for over an hour.</p>\n<p>The Baar\u2019ur squad comes, and they touch the crystal together. Officers and shinies from every battalion pass through at least once. Senator Organa makes an appearance. Senator Amidala does as well. </p>\n<p>There are waves of Jedi, generals and commanders and even the little ones, and Cody has to make a roster that he posts outside the door in order to put some kind of order into this system. </p>\n<p>There is always someone touching the crystal. </p>\n<p>Cody touches it more than most. He isn\u2019t afraid of running out of memories.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur standing over him, a wall between him and the clankers after he was captured.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur\u2019s fury when he found the chips, because how dare anyone take the vode\u2019s ability to choose away from them.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur\u2019s smile when Cody handed him a cup of caf, sweetened exactly how he liked it.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur\u2019s offer to share a cup when it was the last one and both of them were too tired to brew another pot.</p>\n<p>There is peace. There is hope. There is comfort and gratitude and humor.</p>\n<p>And beneath it all, there is love.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur wakes up when Cody is on watch. He blinks his eyes open and then sits up as if he hasn\u2019t been in a healing trance for the better part of a month. Healer Che rushes in, two healers on her heels, but Baar\u2019ur doesn\u2019t notice them.</p>\n<p>He smiles at Cody, and his eyes crinkle at the corners. \u201cI had the most wonderful dreams,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Cody clasps Baar\u2019ur\u2019s hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur has just as many visitors now as he did when he was in his trance. The only difference is that he grows tired easily, and none of the visitors are allowed to stay long. </p>\n<p>None of them, except Cody.</p>\n<p>During the day, he sleeps, he eats, he spends time with his vode, and he trains whenever one of them drags him into the salles. But at night, he takes his place at Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur always reaches out, and Cody accepts the offer and holds his hand. Sometimes, Baar\u2019ur talks until his words become mumbles and then he falls asleep. Sometimes, it\u2019s Cody who talks. And sometimes they sit, comfortable in their silence.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>As Baar\u2019ur heals, his visits become a mix of social and business. </p>\n<p>Healer Che scowls the first time Senator Organa enters with a bag full of datachips, but Baar\u2019ur waves away her frown. \u201cI am needed,\u201d he says, and the words have a weight that Cody doesn\u2019t understand, but Healer Che does, because her frown eases into something sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may conduct office hours, in here, for a limited time each day,\u201d Healer Che says. \u201cAll visits can be ended at my discretion.\u201d Her gaze sharpens as Baar\u2019ur opens his mouth. \u201cThis is non-negotiable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody\u2019s stunned for a moment, and then he laughs. It surprises him as much as it surprises Baar\u2019ur and Senator Organa and Healer Che, but he can\u2019t stop. When he finally wipes the tears from his eyes, he looks over at Healer Che. \u201cYou are his Jetii\u2019buir. He learned it from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly the good things,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says, and he\u2019s smiling now as well. He takes one of Senator Organa\u2019s datareaders. \u201cOnce I\u2019m cleared to drink, buy me a Corellian brandy, and I\u2019ll tell you how <em>The Negotiator</em> got its name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis promises to be a good story,\u201d Senator Organa says. </p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The citizenship bill passes. Cody watches the vote from Baar\u2019ur\u2019s room with Baar\u2019ur and a woman he doesn\u2019t know. She strode in this morning in full beskar\u2019gam, sat at Baar\u2019ur\u2019s side, and hasn\u2019t budged.</p>\n<p>She took her helmet off to reveal short-cropped blond hair, but she didn\u2019t introduce herself. Baar\u2019ur didn\u2019t introduce her either, too busy watching the votes tallied. </p>\n<p>The citizenship vote passes by a wide margin. The reparations bill is closer, but it passes as well. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur leans back against his med-bed with a sigh. \u201cNo need for Plan B, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d the woman says. </p>\n<p>Cody looks between them and wonders what he\u2019s missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, where are my manners?\u201d Baar\u2019ur asks. He gestures between Cody and the woman. \u201cCody, this is Arla Fett. Arla Fett, this is Cody.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody keeps his expression neutral. This is the Prime\u2019s vod. The Prime didn\u2019t think of the vode as his ade. He had Boba. The rest of them were\u2026product. He sold them in exchange for Boba and enough credits to do anything he could possibly want. The vode are vode, but they aren\u2019t part of Clan Fett. He doesn\u2019t know what that makes Arla Fett to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am Mand\u2019alor,\u201d Arla says. \u201cPlan B was mass adoption. It would legitimize you and your brothers, and I would have done it. But it\u2019s impersonal.\u201d She leans forward and makes sure she has Cody\u2019s full attention. \u201cAny and all of you are welcome in the Mandalorian system. Anyone who wants to join Clan Fett, I will name you as aliit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody glances at Baar\u2019ur. First, the citizenship bill. And then the reparations bill. And now an offer of family, of a home. He and his vode were made for the Jedi and bred for the war. But the war is over.</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur misinterprets the look, because he sits up straighter. He can\u2019t quite hide his wince, but he\u2019s stubborn and bats Cody\u2019s hands away when Cody tries to make him more comfortable. \u201cBoba is with her. She took him in after Geonosis. There is a place for all of you. For any who want it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cody says, his words for Arla, but he doesn\u2019t look away from Baar\u2019ur. \u201cI\u2019ll let the vode know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf possible, I\u2019d like to address them as well,\u201d Arla says. \u201cJango\u2026I didn\u2019t really know him. We were farmers, and he was annoying but like all brothers are. And then Kyr\u2019stad attacked. I never saw him again. What he did wasn\u2019t right, but he\u2019s dead. His sins are my sins, and I will see this through. A homestead, citizenship, family, whatever you and your vode,\u201d she smiles at the Mando\u2019a word, \u201cwant. I will see it done. On my honor as Mand\u2019alor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody feels a vague stirring, a long-buried pride. Is that something the Prime taught them when they were on Kamino? Or is it something different? The manda that supposedly binds them all together?</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cody says again. \u201cThis is Wolffe\u2019s comm. He\u2019ll set up an audience for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you?\u201d Arla asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m needed here,\u201d Cody says. </p>\n<p>Arla glances at Baar\u2019ur and then smiles. \u201cI see. Once he\u2019s cleared, you should come visit. Keldabe is thriving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe market is quite lovely,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve added Jaster\u2019s statue to the Great Hall,\u201d Arla says. </p>\n<p>Cody nods. There is an entire history in that city, on that planet. He isn\u2019t sure if he wants it to be his history, but the option is there. He knows he\u2019ll go to see, because he has choices now, and he wants to explore them all. </p>\n<p>\u201cBaar\u2019ur can give you the tour,\u201d Arla says. She laughs at the twin looks of surprise she receives. \u201cYou think you were the first to look at him and see mandokar?\u201d She shakes her head at Cody. \u201cNow, you really need to visit. I\u2019ll tell you all about when I first met him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is hardly necessary,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could tell me yourself,\u201d Cody ventures, feeling brave. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s over-modest,\u201d Arla says. She ruffles Baar\u2019ur\u2019s hair. \u201cGlad you finally snipped the stupid braid.\u201d Her touch turns gentle. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you pulled through. There\u2019s a place on Mandalore for you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur turns to smile at Arla, something soft and private, and Cody feels as though he\u2019s intruding on a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Baar\u2019ur says. \u201cI would like to visit, at least. It\u2019s difficult to get a good tiingular outside of the Mandalorian system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arla lingers for a moment longer before she takes her leave.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Finally, Baar\u2019ur is cleared to leave medical. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s accumulated quite the collection of stuff. Crap, as General Skywalker gleefully calls it. Cody helps Baar\u2019ur pack his things carefully into a bag or crate, depending on the item. There are clothes, loose fitting and comfortable, but infinitely superior to med-gowns. There are hygiene items; toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, brush, beard trimmer, and half a dozen more. </p>\n<p>There are trinkets. A collection of small stones from Jedi who returned from a mission with a rock or pebble. A wooden figurine one of the generals carved in their downtime. Windchimes from Senator Organa and an ultrasound of the twins from Senator Amidala. </p>\n<p>There are dozens of items, large and small, more than Baar\u2019ur ever accumulated in his quarters on <em>The Negotiator</em>. From his slight alarm as they pack, Cody suspects it\u2019s more than he\u2019s ever had period. </p>\n<p>Cody carefully wraps a caf mug that says <em>I run on caffeine and sass</em> in stylized script. He places it alongside three other mugs in the crate. </p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re finished packing, the room seems bare, sterile in a way it hasn\u2019t in quite some time. Cody\u2019s only comfort is that Baar\u2019ur won\u2019t return here. This isn\u2019t his room. The things they packed, the personal touches, those will go with Baar\u2019ur, whether it\u2019s to his room in the Temple or maybe even Mandalore.</p>\n<p>Cody still isn\u2019t sure what to make of Arla Fett. He\u2019s curious enough that he wants to visit Mandalore, see its planets for himself, but he isn\u2019t sure yet if it will be home. He has a suspicion, one so new, so daring, that he carefully guards it, that home for him isn\u2019t a place.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a person.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Baar\u2019ur looks around the room. His bag is slung over his shoulder, the crate left for Cody. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m upset to close the door on this room. But I am grateful for everything it did and what it means.\"</p>\n<p>\"There's one final thing,\" Cody says, and he relishes the curiosity on Baar'ur's face and then his surprise as Cody holds out a jar of lollipops. \u201cRegs say when you leave medical, you take a lollipop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Baar\u2019ur asks. His eyes, brighter than they have been recently, twinkle with amusement. </p>\n<p>\u201cNon-negotiable,\u201d Cody says, somehow managing to keep a straight face. </p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur laughs and plucks a sweet from the jar. \u201cI know better than to argue with you, dear Cody.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dear Cody. He likes it. He holds his free hand out to Baar\u2019ur. \u201cWhere to?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWherever we want, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Baar\u2019ur grasps Cody\u2019s hand, and they leave the Halls of Healing together.</p>"
