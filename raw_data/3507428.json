  "summary": "<p>There's a certain point where you can no longer ask someone what their name is. Thorin isn't sure exactly when that point is, but he knows that it's probably some time before the person in question saves your life. On the far side of the Misty Mountains, Thorin realizes that he never quite caught the first part of Mr. Baggins' name, and he finds that it's astonishingly harder to learn than he would have thought. Fili, Kili, and Dwalin are no help whatsoever.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>So <a href=\"https://curmudgeony.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ias</a> and I were trying to figure out if Thorin ever calls Bilbo by his name before the scenes inside Erebor in DoS, and she joked that maybe Thorin literally did not know Bilbo's name until Balin told it to him. Nearly ten thousand words later, here we are.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Literally, how is nearly ten thousand words. I don't understand. I don't know how this happened to me. This was supposed to be 500 words max, and here we are. </p>\n<p>At one point, I was going to write a sex scene between them where Bilbo would be like, \"Oh Thorin,\" and Thorin would be like, \"Oh....you,\" which probably would have toppled this over to the 15k word mark to get all the set up in there. Cutting that wasn't a length thing so much as some fics just demand to be weird ambiguous friendship love platonic romance things, but feel free to imagine that scene tacked on to the end of the Laketown section. </p>\n<p>You can find more of me at <a href=\"https://margotkim.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">my tumblr</a> where, if you go there right after this is posted, I'll probably be complaining how I somehow didn't accomplish any schoolwork during this spring break. I hope my professors accept \"I'm Bagginshield trash\" as an excuse.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cIt definitely starts with a B,\u201d Kili said earnestly while Thorin sunk his head in his hands. \u201cI remember that distinctly. B.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s his last name, Kili? You still remember that one?\u201d Fili said, earning himself a well-aimed blow from his brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are my heirs,\u201d Thorin said to Dwalin, while Kili tried to pile drive his brother into the ground and Fili laughed and said, \u201cMr. Boggins! Ooh, Mr. Boggins!\u201d Dwalin gave Thorin a sympathetic look, which was less sympathetic than it would have been if Dwalin did not seem so very amused. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe lad and I have not been on great speaking terms,\u201d Dwalin said. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing against him, but we\u2019ve little in common.\u201d</p>\n<p>That had been, more or less, Thorin\u2019s thoughts on the matter, until the hobbit had thrown himself in front of a warg five times his height to save Thorin. But no, that wasn\u2019t the start, though it was close enough that Thorin could pretend. It wasn\u2019t even Master Baggins\u2019 pledge to help them reclaim their home, though that had humbled Thorin tremendously. It was that Master Baggins had come back, when he didn\u2019t need to, and that alone was more than most people Thorin had ever known. That was someone Thorin could embrace.</p>\n<p>Embracing, of course, was easier than the parts that came after. Like talking, for example. Or figuring out some key bits of information that it was rather too late to ask about.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo none of us know his first name,\u201d Thorin said. He glowered at his nephews until they untangled themselves and scrambled to their feet. \u201cI thought you two were friends with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are!\u201d Kili said cheerfully. \u201cOnly, we call him Mr. Baggins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr burglar,\u201d Fili added.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr the great lump.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr sheep head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Thorin stepped forward and winced, his hand raising to his side. In a moment, Fili, Kili, and Dwalin were at his side, their faces so worried that he had half a mind to show them he could still take any of the three in a fight. (Well\u2014perhaps not Dwalin. Thorin could admit he\u2019d need to heal a little more before he tried to topple that mountain.) He waved them off with an undoubtedly sour look on his face, and they scooted back, masking their concern with various degrees of success. Thorin leaned against a tree. \u201cRidiculous.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure which part of this situation he was referring to.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could ask him,\u201d Kili said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, that\u2019s what everyone wants to hear,\u201d Fili said. \u201c\u2018Hello, person we\u2019ve been traveling with for four months. Funny story, but we never quite caught your name.\u2019 That will make him feel like a real member of our company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili\u2019s enthusiasm seemed untampered. \u201cThen we ask Gandalf, or Balin. Or Bofur, he\u2019s good mates with Bofur, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin harrumphed. \u201cIf you think Bofur wouldn\u2019t tell the hobbit in a heartbeat\u2026\u201d He trailed off, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe wizard would be no better,\u201d Thorin said. He fought the urge to rub his temples, lest he summon another inane round of clucking about his health. This type of sneaking went against his character. He was out of practice in the art of delicacy. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Balin, then,\u201d Kili said. \u201cHe knows how to keep a secret, trust me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Fili asked. \u201cWhat have you told him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Kili replied too quickly.</p>\n<p>Thorin and Dwalin glanced at each other and had a silent conversation as only old, old friends could do. They could ask Balin, of course, and Balin would tell them and never mention a word of it to Mr. Baggins. But Balin would be so very disappointed in them. In him specifically, Thorin thought, Balin would mostly be disappointed in Thorin, and perhaps Thorin wanted to avoid that because when Thrain disappeared, Balin had stepped in as best he could as something close to a father figure, but there was also that fact that Thorin felt like enough of an idiot at the moment and there was really no need to widen the circle of people who knew it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe ask no one. When we get to wherever Gandalf is taking us, there will be introductions,\u201d Thorin said. He looked firmly at his nephews, at his heirs, assuming everything went as he hoped it would, and found them eager.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll listen and report back,\u201d Kili said, like he was being sent on a scouting mission.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t say a word to Mr. Baggins,\u201d Fili said, which Thorin appreciated a little more than Kili\u2019s unbridled enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I </em>could ask Balin,\u201d Dwalin said, sounding like he really didn\u2019t want to. \u201cHe expects me not to know things like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh but Balin would <em>know</em>,\u201d Kili said before Thorin could. \u201cHe just knows all sorts of things without anyone having to say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKili, what does he know about you?\u201d Fili asked. Kili gave him a look that he probably thought was subtle and translated very obviously to <em>not in front of Uncle.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>Kili wrinkled his nose sympathetically. \u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin started to laugh again as Thorin closed his eyes and thought very hard about how he couldn\u2019t die until his heirs were about fifty years older, at which point they would probably be at least a few years wiser than they were now. Which Thorin admitted was big talk from a man desperately scrambling to learn the name of someone he\u2019d traveled with for four months, someone who had saved his life and pledged his service to him, someone who had proven beyond all doubts that he deserved more respect than Thorin had ever offered him, but never let it be said that Thorin Oakenshield couldn\u2019t feel bad about two things at once.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one heard?\u201d Thorin asked his little council. Out behind the great hall, in the garden surrounded by bees the size of their heads, Fili and Kili had at least the decency to look ashamed. Dwalin just shrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cForgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI got distracted by the bear man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat did seem more important,\u201d Fili said.</p>\n<p>Thorin almost said something like <em>you can acknowledge the bear man and still listen for one name</em>, but he stopped himself. There was an obvious rebuttal to that, and even though Thorin didn\u2019t set him up for it, Kili said it anyway. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear Mr. Baggins\u2019 name either, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d Thorin pinched his nose. \u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin made grunt that sounded like he agreed. \u201cThorin, the time for subtlety\u2019s over. Just ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, we can\u2019t do that!\u201d Kili protested. Then a quick looked of confusion passed over his face. \u201cWait, when you say \u2018he,\u2019 do you mean Mr. Baggins or Balin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin thrust a hand at Kili and looked pointedly at Thorin as if to say, <em>See? </em>\u201cJust have a conversation with the lad, he\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll understand, but he\u2019ll feel terrible,\u201d Kili said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got him feeling like a member of the Company and know we\u2019re supposed to take that away?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fili frowned at his brother. \u201cWhy\u2019ve you gone all tender-hearted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a good person, Fili.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that\u2019s not true, Kili.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, then because I <em>just</em> had a nice conversation with him and I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s got many hobbit friends and he was nice to Bifur last night.\u201d Kili looked pointedly at Fili who raised his hands in surrender. His brother thus won over, Kili shifted to looking at Thorin imploringly. \u201cWe can\u2019t make him feel bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Thorin said, wondering if he could keep that promise.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen ask another dwarf!\u201d Dwalin also looked at Thorin. You could have called it imploringly, except that he mostly seemed to be imploring Thorin to stop acting like an idiot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Balin. Mahal knows, I wouldn\u2019t ask Balin, with his infinite wells of disappointment for eyes. Ask someone else.\u201d When Thorin grimaced, Dwalin added, \u201cWe\u2019re dwarves, not elves. We don\u2019t prattle. We can keep a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecret?\u201d Bofur\u2019s head popped around the edge of the house, pipe sticking out of his mouth. \u201cWhat secret? Are we talking about what Bombur said last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long were you there?\u201d Thorin asked at the same time Dwalin shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t sneak up on warriors!\u201d while Fili and Kili said excitedly, \u201cWhat did Bombur say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBombur was telling us about the time Dori got drunk off his arse at the last Durin\u2019s Day feast, stood on a table, and serenaded Beli\u2019s wife,\u201d Bofur said, grinning and ignoring two-thirds of the questions leveled his way.</p>\n<p>\u201cBofur!\u201d Dori shouted, his head shoved out the window above them that Thorin had not noticed. Thorin had a small conniption of terror (<em>How long were you listening? </em>still being the relevant question) as Dori glowered down at Bofur who was laughing so hard his hat was threatening to wobble off. \u201cThat\u2019s not how that night went and your lying brother knows that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLying? <em>Lying</em>?\u201d Bofur said, shaking his fist at Dori with more good-natured cheer than Dori seemed to appreciate. \u201cWere you lying when you said no woman but Brun would make you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dori\u2019s head disappeared for a moment, accompanied by the sound of thumping feet running closer and closer. Bofur clapped his hat tighter on his head, shrugged at the four of them, and took off running.</p>\n<p>Thorin gave Dwalin a pointed look. \u201cWe absolutely prattle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Dwalin said, looking after Bofur sprinting across the gardens, Dori hot on his heels. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Dori the type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see it,\u201d Fili said. \u201cYou think it was a love ballad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019d have to be,\u201d Kili said. \u201cOtherwise why would he be so upset?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould have been a soldier\u2019s song,\u201d Dwalin said. \u201cIf I sang one of those to a dwarf\u2019s wife, I\u2019d keep it a secret too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe ask no one anything. Ever,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cAnd when I am king under the mountain, I\u2019m finding better trusted advisors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili nodded sagely at that. \u201cMake sure they\u2019ve got a good mind for names.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Thorin was laying out his bedroll for a fifth miserable night in Mirkwood when Fili leaned over and hissed, \u201cHe signed a contract.\u201d He raised his eyebrows at Thorin. \u201cYou know. With his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know how signatures work,\u201d Thorin said, but he clasped his hand on Fili\u2019s shoulder anyway. \u201cWell done.\u201d His nephew beamed like the sunlight they hadn\u2019t seen for a while. A moment later, perhaps sensing his brother\u2019s happiness and feeling the need to share in it or destroy it, whatever brotherly inclination he felt today, Kili was there as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d he asked, looking between the two of them. \u201cHave we made progress on, you know, <em>the mission</em>?\u201d He raised his eyebrows pointedly at Thorin. \u201cYou know. With the hobbit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I knew what you were talking about,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe contract,\u201d Fili said to Kili, and Kili oohed.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight! With his signature,\u201d Kili said. \u201cThat\u2019ll have his name, Uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo both of you think that I\u2019m very bad at understanding simple concepts?\u201d Thorin asked, then held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t answer. Who has the contract?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the bad news. Mr. Baggins has it,\u201d Fili said. \u201cBut I figure you can just ask to, you know, read it again. Maybe you forgot a clause or you want to make sure that he\u2019s getting the treatment we promised him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is definitely not,\u201d Kili said cheerfully. \u201cThis has been <em>much worse </em>than what we promised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough. You\u2019re both on first watch.\u201d Thorin gave both of his nephews a stern look. It did less than it had when they were younger. That was the damned thing about the quest, Thorin thought as he left his nephews to stalk over to the other side of camp where Mr. Baggins and Bombur were counting out rations. You spend enough time with people, you get to see that they\u2019re all a little ridiculous. When he was king, he\u2019d have to make sure that no one talked to him longer than five minutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello there and give us a minute,\u201d Mr. Baggins said as Thorin settled down on the ground beside him. Bombur glanced at them and kept counting. \u201cWe\u2019re not done assembling our feast yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin glanced down at the slabs of honey bread. \u201cWhat fresh bounty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it,\u201d Mr. Baggins said wryly. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine I\u2019ll ever get tired of honey bread. Why, if I was back in the Shire and eating my seven meals a day, I think I\u2019d make all of them honey bread and nothing but honey bread. Or better yet, I\u2019d simply drizzle some honey on a rock and knock that back. It\u2019ll taste about the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than starvation,\u201d Thorin said, the highest praise he could honestly offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMany things are better than starvation, Thorin,\u201d Mr. Baggins said, and yes, Thorin did feel guilty about how easily the hobbit could use Thorin\u2019s name, thank you for asking. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to set your standards a little higher when you\u2019re king.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bombur stood. \u201cThat\u2019s rations then. I\u2019ll start handing out, little bunny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh stop,\u201d Mr. Baggins said as Bombur scooped up the company\u2019s dinner in his arms. Thorin nodded appreciatively at Bombur when he handed Thorin his slice, though he would have been a little more appreciative if he\u2019d said Mr. Baggins\u2019 name in the process.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was always worth seeing Mr. Baggins\u2019 face when someone brought up the <em>little bunny </em>nickname.</p>\n<p>When he was gone, Thorin asked, \u201cDo you have your contract?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins frowned in thought, or possibly at the slice of honey bread he\u2019d just taken a bite out of. \u201cYes, in my pack. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to reconsider some sections,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cBefore we reach the mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou mean you would like to change the terms of our contract when I\u2019m miles from home with no recourse and nowhere to go if I find the terms unfavorable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Thorin said quickly. \u201cI want to make the contract fairer to you, not worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome sections are lacking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s true enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2014wait, what?\u201d That had not been the reaction Thorin expected.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we going to discuss the funeral arrangements section?\u201d Mr. Baggins\u2019 clenched his pipe between his teeth and started digging in his pack. \u201cAt what point of service do I warrant more than a\u2014how did you phrase it.\u201d He pulled out the contract, looking a little worse for wear, and flipped it open. \u201cA commoner\u2019s funeral with one pine coffin, and you will not send my body home.\u201d He looked up from the contract with as look as dry as the parchment he was holding.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine clause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA commoner\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin paused. \u201cYes?\u201d And then seeing from the hobbit\u2019s face that this wasn\u2019t the right answer, \u201cWe did specify a coffin. That\u2019s better than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it usually?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a hole in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins laughed incredulously. \u201cGood heavens. Would you wrap me in something first or just push me in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe some tasteful leaves,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cOr we\u2019d set you on fire.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>The hobbit held out the contract. Thorin took it, with such a feeling of heady gratefulness that he couldn\u2019t help but smile, an expression the hobbit returned, albeit with a shake of his head that implied he was thinking once again about the strangeness of dwarves.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to offer me more treasure?\u201d Mr. Baggins said as Thorin flipped to the back. \u201cBonuses for trauma endured?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can have Fili and Kili\u2019s share,\u201d Thorin muttered. Last page. The signatures. There was Thorin\u2019s, yes, and Balin\u2019s underneath it, and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, I don\u2019t want that,\u201d Mr. Baggins said obliviously as Thorin stared down in horror. \u201cNot if it comes with the rest of their gains. I\u2019d rather not be in line for the throne, thank you. I like being able to lock my neighbors out, and I don\u2019t think you get to do that when you\u2019re king.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Thorin squinted down at the page, then up at B-something Baggins, then back down at the page. \u201cYou cannot.\u201d Illegible. Absolutely illegible. There was something he vaguely recognized as a B at the beginning, but he couldn\u2019t even trust that he was identifying that versus simply recognizing what he knew should be there. There was a strange swoop and then a squiggle, then some kind of violent slash, and finally, in letters that could not have been clearer, <em>Baggins</em>. \u201cWhat a signature you have,\u201d Thorin said helplessly.</p>\n<p>B-something Baggins chuckled, the bastard. Bastard Baggins, yes, there we go, Thorin thought, mystery solved. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even read the first name.\u201d Thorin hoped he sounded more joking than desperate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou only need the last one for official purposes,\u201d the monster of a hobbit said. \u201cI suppose I always got lazy when it came to my first name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins just smiled, then took another bite from his bread and promptly stopped smiling. \u201cWhat sections were you thinking about then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin squinted at the signature one last time (maybe it was just the dimness of the forest?) before he surrendered. \u201cYour rights in Erebor after we reclaim it,\u201d he said despondently. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want to make sure that you\u2019ll be accorded all the welcome you are due.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know why that was the lie he picked, for that was not something that Thorin particularly wanted to think about. And yet it was something Thorin had been thinking about a lot lately. He\u2019d be a fool to pretend that he thought he was guaranteed to survive this quest. He was already a fool for thinking that it would work at all, and that was all the foolishness he could spare. He knew his company would look after his hobbit if Thorin could not, but he couldn\u2019t guarantee their safety either. He couldn\u2019t guarantee anyone\u2019s. Least of all Mr. Baggins\u2019. He thought of a little pinewood coffin out here in the wild and then resolutely didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be morbid, Thorin,\u201d Mr. Baggins said, waving him off. \u201cNothing bad is going to happen to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re on a quest to slay a dragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust the same.\u201d Mr. Baggins thought for a moment and grimaced at whatever he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant enough being in these woods. We don\u2019t need to talk about dire, dark things as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecaution is not dire and dark,\u201d Thorin said with an insistence that almost made him forget that he\u2019d pulled this entire discussion out of thin air as a cover up for trying to read an illegible signature.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is when it\u2019s a precaution in case something dire and dark happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather face that eventuality unprepared?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirstly, if anyone is going to survive this quest, it will be you, powered by sheer stubbornness,\u201d Mr. Baggins said. \u201cAnd secondly, should by some horrid tragedy you not survive, I don\u2019t think that if anyone in this company would kick me out of the mountain because you were gone.\u201d Mr. Baggins paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you thinking about Fili and Kili?\u201d Thorin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, they might think it was funny. But then I\u2019m sure Balin would talk some sense into them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr Dwalin would beat some sense into them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins hid his smile behind another bite of honey bread. \u201cEither one. So you see, I am very well taken care you, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the same, you\u2019d settle my mind if we could agree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this worry you that much?\u201d Mr. Baggins asked, sounding genuinely surprised.</p>\n<p>Thorin shifted. He didn\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cYes,\u201d he said and realized in saying it that it was completely true. \u201cI want to be sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, alright, if you\u2019re going to fuss,\u201d Mr. Baggins said, ducking his head. Thorin thought he might have been flushed, but it was too dark now to be sure. \u201cAfter all, this quest has been nothing but me following your ridiculous whims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd saving me from them,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd rather too much honey bread.\u201d Mr. Baggins waved Ori over. \u201cWhat a gloriously grand adventure. I can\u2019t believe I almost didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p>\n<p>The terms they agreed on were simple but satisfactory. Mr. Baggins could stay at Erebor as long as he pleased (\u201cIn perpetuity, that\u2019s the official way to say it,\u201d Ori had said conspiratorially to that, tapping his nose) and would be paid a stipend from the royal treasury to support himself so that he didn\u2019t need to work. He\u2019d have the official status of royal guest and would receive any and all benefits granted by that status until such time as he chose to leave Erebor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I refuse to ever leave?\u201d Mr. Baggins asked. Thorin\u2019s heart seized a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn perpetuity,\u201d Ori said firmly. Then he glanced at Thorin who nodded at him. \u201cEr. Yes. In perpetuity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins gave Thorin a pleased look. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to drain the treasury dry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin snorted. \u201cI doubt the one member of this company who thought that lapis lazuli was a type of fish will be that big a financial drain, no matter how many books and cups of tea he orders on the king\u2019s dole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins laughed, his head tossed back. \u201cI\u2019ll have to get more expensive tastes.\u201d He tapped the contract that Ori was holding. \u201cOoh, and add that I get a private bedroom in the royal section.\u201d He looked at Thorin. \u201cThere is a royal section?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thorin said, \u201cthat\u2019s where the royalty sleeps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Mr. Baggins replied. \u201cPut me right next to Thorin, that\u2019ll probably be the best room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t have a room. I\u2019m supposed to be dead in this scenario,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of this entire clause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and now I\u2019m thinking how we are actually going to live in Erebor,\u201d Mr. Baggins said, \u201cwhich is a situation in which you are very much not dead and where I would like to get the best room possible for my stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you are staying then?\u201d Thorin asked, his heart pounding in his ears.</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins dropped his eyes again, smiling a little, and shrugged. \u201cNo sense going through the efforts to help you get your mountain back and not stick around a while to see what it\u2019s like. If, er, you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Thorin said, probably too quickly. He balled his fists in his lap. \u201cAs we said. In perpetuity. Stay forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ori looked at Thorin again. \u201cIf that\u2019s it then,\u201d he said, with the tone of someone who was eager to be elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019ll just need you both to sign again to the new agreement.\u201d He passed Thorin the quill. \u201cRight here on the top line. And then our master burglar can sign underneath.\u201d</p>\n<p>And not for the first time Thorin thought that surely <em>someone </em>in this company at some point could call Mr. Baggins by his first name.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made me all self-conscious about my signature now,\u201d Mr. Baggins said to Thorin, taking the quill when he was done.</p>\n<p>\u201cSign neater then,\u201d Thorin said with a fake nonchalance that was almost painful. Mr. Baggins raised his eyebrow at him and scribbled what appeared to be three loops in a row.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike that?\u201d Mr. Baggins asked innocently.</p>\n<p>Thorin resisted the urge to sink his head into his hands. \u201cExactly, little bunny. Just like that.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kili grunted when Thorin asked for a third time. His face was nearly as pale as the mist-covered lake itself, and with all the sweat running down it, likely nearly as wet. But what could Thorin do, here on this trash heap of a barge? Oin sat on one side of his nephew. Fili sat on the other. And Fili had already told Thorin privately how little Kili wanted him there.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make him feel ashamed, Uncle,\u201d Fili had said, his eyes cast low. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to look weak in front of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>After the spider attack, his stay in Thranduil\u2019s prison, and miserable escape, Thorin had not thought he could feel worse than he already did. And once again, his relations managed to prove him wrong. So Thorin\u2019s mood was (justifiably, he maintained) wretched by the time Mr. Baggins started singing Bard the bargeman\u2019s praises.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know his name?\u201d Thorin snapped. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I asked him,\u201d Mr. Baggins snapped back.</p>\n<p>Behind the hobbit\u2019s back, Dwalin stared pointedly at Thorin. Thorin elected to ignore him. Thorin was perfectly capable of hearing the implications himself. That didn\u2019t stop Dwalin from sidling over the second that Mr. Baggins walked away to the other end of the boat. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Dwalin asked. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know someone\u2019s name so he asked. Brilliant. If you\u2019re still keen on finding new advisors, I\u2019d recommend that lad. He\u2019s got a good head on his shoulders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDwalin,\u201d Thorin said warningly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ought to go over and hire him right now. I think I know what the first subject he advises you on ought to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin sighed. He couldn\u2019t even be cross with Dwalin\u2014well, <em>that</em> cross, but Dwalin was naturally and always a bit of a prick so Thorin was used to that. \u201cBofur said his name to me when we were taken,\u201d Thorin said glumly.</p>\n<p>Dwalin leaned in immediately. \u201cDoes that mean you know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Thorin had been a little less cold, wet, and miserable, he might have given Dwalin a slightly less helpless look. As it was, he was about one cold breeze away from hypothermia so he probably looked as kingly as a drowned kitten when he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear it. Bofur whispered, \u2018Where\u2019s\u2014\u2019\u201d Thorin made a chopping gesture where Mr. Baggins name was supposed to be. \u201cConsidering the circumstances, I couldn\u2019t ask him to repeat it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Dwalin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I was.\u201d Thorin tried to run a hand through his hair and ended up with his fingers tangled in the spider-webbed, water-logged mess.</p>\n<p>Dwalin was looking at Thorin the way, well, the way Dwalin usually looked at Fili and Kili, which was certainly humbling. \u201cJust <em>ask</em> him, Thorin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin disentangled his fingers, feeling a little like a cat who\u2019d just gotten his claw stuck and intended to act like no one had seen it. \u201cDo you remember after the Carrock when I said that we couldn\u2019t ask him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wrong. That was when we should have asked,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cI see that now. I can admit that you were right back then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. We are nearly at the foot of Erebor. I\u2019m sending him in to burgle the Arkenstone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you should know his name before that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Thorin hissed. A few feet in front of them, Gloin turned around and looked at them questioningly. Dwalin and Thorin glared until Gloin faced forward again. It didn\u2019t take long. At least Thorin\u2019s glares still worked on somebody. In a quieter voice, Thorin said, \u201cAm I supposed to push him towards a dragon hours after I tell him that I didn\u2019t even bother to learn his name this entire time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be happy to vouch for how much bother you went to,\u201d Dwalin replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept this secret long enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin shook his head. \u201cThe longer you keep a secret, the longer you have to keep a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree. And yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin started to say something and stopped. He looked pained. More so than he had looked crawling out of the barrel. Either he\u2019d been injured in the escape or he was about to try a heart-to-heart. \u201cThe hobbit won\u2019t be angry.\u201d Thorin winced. Heart-to-heart it was. \u201cNo.\u201d Dwalin stuck his finger in Thorin\u2019s face. \u201cListen. I\u2019m only saying this because Balin can\u2019t. Then we\u2019re not going to talk about this again. The hobbit won\u2019t be angry. He likes you. You like him. Everyone knows that he likes you. Everyone knows that you like him. Neither of you are subtle. Whatever you are imagining will happen if he finds out, it won\u2019t. Unless you imagine him laughing at you for a good hour. That probably will.\u201d Dwalin crossed his arms. \u201cSo are you going to ask him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to say his name sooner or later, and Mr. Baggins will never have to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet it out of your system. You can\u2019t abuse me anymore when I\u2019m king.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin harrumphed. \u201cIf you think a crown\u2019s going to stop me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin patted Dwalin\u2019s arm. \u201cI never thought that.\u201d He cleared his throat, his face still a little hot from Dwalin\u2019s speech. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMahal, no,\u201d Dwalin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good. I was out of compliments after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin punched Thorin in the shoulder. He always managed to hit the same spot. Thorin\u2019d had a bruise there for decades now. They stood in silence beside each other as the barge glided through the misty waters. Then Dwalin leaned over. \u201cYou know my name, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do, Oin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin might have said something then, probably something blisteringly rude, but it was at that moment that the mist parted. \u201cOh,\u201d breathed Dwalin, softer than the mist around them. Thorin said nothing. He could not. Because there was home. What else was there to say?</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Thorin tapped out of the party at midnight, when by all accounts it was just getting started. Most of the company was chugging ahead without any sign of halting. That didn\u2019t concern him much. It would take more than this piss ale to get dwarves too drunk. There were only a few members of the company taking an early night along with him. Bofur, for one, was already passed out under a table. Thorin made a mental note to make sure someone checked on him in the morning. Thorin had sent Kili to bed to rest, and he was worried about the way his nephew went without fuss. Fili had gone with him, and Oin as well. The rest of his dwarves still packed into the grand hall as Thorin slipped out. When the great wood doors shut behind him, it swallowed the noise of the party down to a nicely muffled din.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll that chaos too much for you as well?\u201d Mr. Baggins asked. He was sitting cross-legged by the edge of the dock with a plate in his lap that could have been at least three meals. There were four empty plates behind him. Thorin shuddered to think of hobbit metabolisms.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Thorin said, coming to sit beside Mr. Baggins.</p>\n<p>\u201cLong day? Long week. Long month. Long journey.\u201d Mr. Baggins held up a leg of lamb. \u201cGood food though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow you can possibly be hungry after what you put away at the feast, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins simply shrugged happily and kept tucking away. Thorin leaned back on his hands and stared out over the water, towards the mountain. The moonlight was so bright and clear today that it seemed as if the Lonely Mountain stood lonely no more, its pale twin reflected perfectly in the lake. It was too much to think about this close and still so far. \u201cWhy did you say what you did?\u201d Thorin asked, his eyes still on Erebor.</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins swallowed a mouthful and asked, \u201cYou mean telling people my name was Otho Banks at the feast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor one,\u201d Thorin said dryly. He\u2019d followed Mr. Baggins around that feast for two hours, not that he particular minding the following, but it had been in the hopes that the hobbit would surely, at some point, state his first name. Thorin was starting to think he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe it was Mister. Now he was giving out fake ones, the unfairness of which at this point was disappointing but not surprising.</p>\n<p><em>Disappointing but not surprising</em> also summed up much of Thorin\u2019s life in general.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did look very pained when you heard that,\u201d Mr. Baggins said. He gave Thorin a look that seemed to be asking <em>why</em>. Thorin ignored it. He probably <em>had</em> looked very pained when he\u2019d heard that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you tell these people that was your name when,\u201d and here Thorin made an educated guess, \u201cit is not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins laughed sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s silly, I know. But Bard\u2014and don\u2019t scowl, Thorin, he\u2019s a perfectly lovely man who didn\u2019t need to help us and just wants his people to be safe\u2014made it clear that the Master wasn\u2019t to be trusted. And I know I\u2019m far away from anyone who knows me, but\u2026\u201d Mr. Baggins moved his plate off his back and leaned back like Thorin. The moonlight lit his thoughtful frown. \u201cI told you about the creature in the Misty Mountains.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin nodded. \u201cYou are still thinking about how you told him your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to think about so much,\u201d Mr. Baggins said. \u201cAnd yet I can\u2019t forget it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m worried about, but I\u2019m worried about it.\u201d And that last sentence seemed to sum up much of Mr. Baggins\u2019 life.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it weighs so heavily on your mind, then you do well to be so cautious about your name,\u201d Thorin said, though it killed him to say it. \u201cShall I call you Otho from now on then? After your favorite relative?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I picked him. I can\u2019t stand even pretending to be married to Lobelia. You know she\u2019ll get Bag End if I die.\u201d He said this last bit like this reason alone was incentive for him to stay alive. The hobbit contemplated the mountain, his mouth set in a thin line of worry. Thorin turned to contemplate the mountain alongside him. Together they sat in silence and fretted, which wasn\u2019t exactly a pleasant experience but was certainly an improvement of Thorin\u2019s usual situation of fretting alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said \u2018for one,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Baggins said, still looking upon the mountain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you asked me why I said what I said, you said the fake names for one. Was there \u2026something else you wanted to ask about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI vouched for your character because I meant it,\u201d Mr. Baggins said simply. \u201cYou are the highest caliber of person I have ever met and I would follow you\u2014well.\u201d Mr. Baggins gestured at Erebor. \u201cAcross the world to a dragon hoard. That\u2019s why I said that. There\u2019s no one to whom I would rather stake my good name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin didn\u2019t look at Mr. Baggins. He didn\u2019t look at him for a very long time. Then he cleared his throat and said, \u201cSorry, what good name is that again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Baggins laughed and bumped his shoulder against Thorin\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Thorin laughed too and then said, \u201cTruly, I do not know your name. Please tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Otho, of course,\u201d Mr. Baggins said merrily. \u201cOtho Banks at your service.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin gave up. He flopped backwards on the pier and stared up at the stars. After a moment, Mr. Baggins flopped down beside him, looking up at the stars that Thorin had grown up under, even if he had never known them inside the mountain. They worried together a while longer, shoulder to shoulder, and if it still wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant, Thorin thought, you couldn\u2019t beat the company.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Thorin knew this air. Thorin knew this stone. As Mr. Baggins crept towards the great treasure of Thorin\u2019s people, Thorin ran his hands along the inside of his mountain. The stench of dragon and death still fouled the air. But underneath. That he knew. That was the air his people had breathed when the halls of Erebor were lit by gold.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t stay in there. He couldn\u2019t wait halfway home. Thorin stalked out into the open and hated it the second he breathed it again.</p>\n<p>They waited. Thorin closed his eyes and paced out the steps along with Mr. Baggins. He didn\u2019t know where the secret door let out, but it was on the west side, near the top of the service tunnels. There was nowhere for him to go besides the great hall. He would be there now, surely, unless Mr. Baggins crept slower than rock grew. What did he see? Was his face lit by the golden glow?</p>\n<p>They waited in the silence. And then they heard the roar. Thorin remembered it. Thorin had could never forget it, and he\u2019d never tried. He\u2019d hoarded his hatred as much as Smaug hoarded his people\u2019s gold and bones. Noise in the deep came again. Mr. Baggins was down there, against that. And still Thorin did not move.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Bilbo?\u201d Ori asked.</p>\n<p>Thorin thought about waiting in Thranduil\u2019s prison with more hope than he had known for a long while. Then he thought about gold. \u201cGive him more time.\u201d Hadn\u2019t his hobbit proven that he could get Thorin anything he needed if he just had enough time?</p>\n<p>\u201cTime to do what?\u201d Balin snapped. \u201cTo be killed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're afraid,\u201d Thorin accused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! Yes, I'm afraid!\u201d Balin said as if cowardice this close to their treasure wasn\u2019t shameful. \u201cI fear for you, Thorin. A sickness lies on that treasure, a sickness that drove your grandfather mad!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin flinched away. \u201cI am not my grandfather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not yourself! The Thorin I know would not hesitate\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not risk this quest for the life of one\u2014\u201d He faltered for a moment. He found his footing again. \u201cBurglar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBilbo,\u201d Balin said. \u201cHis name is Bilbo!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo Baggins.</p>\n<p>It should have been something more. After all this time, it should have been something more. Not the name, no, because once Thorin heard it, it slotted into place as perfectly as the Arkenstone above the throne. It was the discovery that was lacking. Balin hadn\u2019t even been the first to say it, Thorin thought distantly. It was Ori. Ori had blurted it out and Thorin hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t. Not now at least, not when there were larger things happening, not with revenge and reclamation yet to be done, with the Arkenstone unfound, with a dragon awake. It didn\u2019t matter right now, with his sword pressed against the burglar\u2019s chest because Thorin could hear the gold singing and no nameless thing was going to quit on a job halfway through. And it didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cBilbo!\u201d Thorin shouted for the first time, and it felt right in his mouth. It felt as right as the gold around him. It felt as right as his grandfather\u2019s crown. Bilbo, Thorin thought, and the sound was like another treasure on top of what he\u2019d already reclaimed. Bilbo could be another treasure. And why not? He\u2019d signed the contract. He\u2019d said he wanted to stay. Let him stay in the royal suites like Thorin promised. That served Thorin all the better. The Arkenstone was still lost to him for now, and that taught him a valuable lesson\u2014do not let what\u2019s precious to you out of your sight.</p>\n<p>Thorin\u2019s grandfather had told him once that you could never own something you didn\u2019t know the name of. He meant rocks. \u201cBilbo,\u201d the king under the mountain said, and he knew what he meant.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Bilbo\u2019s was the last face that Thorin saw before dying. Call it one last gasp of greed\u2014Thorin was happy beyond words for the sight and the simple pleasure that he had a name, at last, to put to it. He wrapped the name around himself. And then he let it go. \u201cFarewell, Master Burglar,\u201d Thorin said, and if there was something selfish about wanting to die with a little bit of selflessness, there were none here but Bilbo to judge him, and to Bilbo\u2019s judgment and grief and arms Thorin willingly surrendered himself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>Bilbo\u2019s was not the first face that Thorin saw when he came back to life.</p>\n<p>The universe, it turned out, did not like parallels that much.</p>\n<p>So Thorin\u2019s first sight upon waking was Dwalin, sitting vigil in the hospital tent. Then it was Fili as he hobbled over at the sound of Dwalin\u2019s shouts, and then it was Kili as he hobbled after his brother. And then it was Bilbo. His face was paler than Thorin remembered it and speckled with someone else\u2019s blood like freckles. He wore the blue tunic of a medic and he was wiping his hands clean on a filthy rag as he rushed over. As Fili and Kili flung themselves on top of Thorin, he saw Bilbo\u2019s eyes begin to water. The last thing that Thorin saw before he succumbed to the blackness again was Dwalin clapping his hand comfortingly on Bilbo\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>That was such a surreal sight that Thorin was fairly convinced he was still dead.</p>\n<p>Thorin slept. He slept and woke and slept again, more sleeping than waking. His conscious hours lasted no longer than the time it took to pour a little broth down his throat. He was never sure who was doing it except when it was Bilbo\u2019s hands that tilted his head back and stroked his cheek when he was done. Even after the quest, Bilbo\u2019s hands were softer than any other that Thorin had ever known.</p>\n<p>Once when he woke, Gandalf was there, puffing as happily on his pipe as if the hospital tent had been his private parlor. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Gandalf said simply. \u201cThat foolhardy plan of yours could have gone very differently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin groaned. That was about the most he could manage.</p>\n<p>And he slept. Eventually he slept less. Oin fussed over him tremendously, but there wasn\u2019t much Thorin could do about it considering that raising his arms seemed like the most heroic feat imaginable. His nephews were faring better. Fili\u2019s fall had shattered a leg, but dwarves were deft hands at whittling new ones as needed. By the time that Thorin was just managing to start sitting up in bed, Oin had turned Fili into a second pair of hands. \u201cAt least then I can <em>pretend</em> he\u2019s helping to heal his brother every time the two of them escape for hours,\u201d Oin grumbled.</p>\n<p>The wounded stayed in medical tents outside the walls of Erebor. Elven medical tents, Thorin realized with horror, but not even Dwalin would indulge his outrage on this one. \u201cYou want to put the sick and the dying next to the dragon shit,\u201d Dwalin said, \u201cyou be my guest. Me, I\u2019m fine with Thranduil footing the bill for all this.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he put it that way, how could Thorin resist? Oin eventually had to tell Thorin to stop encouraging young dwarf medics to wreck anything that seemed expensive. \u201cHe\u2019ll charge Erebor for the cost,\u201d Oin pointed out.</p>\n<p>Thorin weighted that in his mind. \u201cBut it will inconvenience him in the short run.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he finished up checking Thorin\u2019s bandages, Bilbo rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that you getting over your gold sickness hasn\u2019t made you a better person,\u201d he said, his fingers so delicately taping down the fresh gauze that Thorin couldn\u2019t feel it\u2014a welcome shift from his reaction to Oin\u2019s considerably gruffer approach, which could be summed up as <em>feeling it entirely too much so as to make sure that reckless dwarves don\u2019t do this sort of nonsense again.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard you should be kind to the wounded?\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>Bilbo snorted and flicked the only place on Thorin\u2019s chest that wasn\u2019t mottled purple with bruises.</p>\n<p>Bilbo had come in everyday to tend to Thorin. Oin said he\u2019d been there as Thorin slept as well. Thorin wasn\u2019t his only charge, of course. Hobbits, it turned out, had precisely the right temperament for healing, and so Bilbo spread his talents through the wounded camp. Some days Thorin saw him for just moment as he passed on, presumably to someone in more imminent risk of dying. Just last Monday, Bilbo had rushed into Thorin\u2019s tent, held his hand to Thorin\u2019s forehead, said, \u201cDrink more water,\u201d and ran out again.</p>\n<p>But that was a rare thing these days. Now, whoever was still left alive was either up and about like Fili or in it for the long haul like Thorin. Thorin had slept through the days when the pyres had burned. Death being more infrequent now, the mourners could afford a little more craftsmanship. Bard himself had thanked the dwarves. \u201cPine coffins may seem a luxury when we\u2019ve yet to rebuild our homes,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cbut we ought to give the dead some dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he was gone, Bilbo had given Thorin a small, tired smile and said, \u201cI won\u2019t mention the whole \u2018commoner\u2019s funeral\u2019 thing to him if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Less death meant more free time, at least for the medics. And Bilbo spent his free time, by and large, with Thorin, which made up quite a good deal for the sword wound in his stomach (as did, obviously, Erebor, but that was still a more distant pleasure and pride, and Thorin was still not entirely convinced that everyone wasn\u2019t just lying to him about there being a reconstruction project just to make sure that he\u2019d be a better patient). The two of them had talked plenty over the course of the quest\u2014<em>plenty</em>, as Dwalin had been happy to point out\u2014but it was one thing to snatch conversation while you waited for Dori to ford the stream or Bofur to realize that Kili had knotted his laces together, but it was quite another to sit in one place for hours, days, <em>weeks</em>, with nothing much to do except chat. And sleep. And chat again. Thorin got used to Bilbo climbing up into bed beside him and nodding off after a long shift. You give him twenty minutes like that, his head buried in Thorin\u2019s stronger shoulder, and then Bilbo was good to go for another ten hours.</p>\n<p>Today Bilbo came into Thorin\u2019s tent like he\u2019d fallen down a particularly sooty chimney and said, \u201cThe good news is that your nephews are fully healed. The bad news is that your nephews are fully healed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they up to their old tricks?\u201d Thorin asked as Bilbo went over to the water basin on the bedside table.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorse, it was an accident so you can\u2019t even be that mad at them. They were helping Dain\u2019s men move the heating fuel and managed to cover half of the training fields in coal dust,\u201d Bilbo said. When he thrust his hands into the water, the water turned black. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last hour cleaning it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd is it clean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo laughed. \u201cNo, not at all, but we realized that we could leave those two to clean it up themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love my nephews,\u201d Thorin said, \u201cand yet I am very glad that Balin and Dain are the acting joint heads of government right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are Fili and Kili.\u201d Bilbo dunked his face. When he came back up, eyes squeezed shut and the front of his curls sopping, he fumbled for a washcloth and said, \u201cYou know, the active heads of government are keen for you to become the actual head of government.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin groaned, as he wouldn\u2019t have if there were anyone else listening. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d talked about this. With Thorin\u2019s wounds nearly healed\u2014or, more accurately, as healed as they were going to be anytime soon\u2014it was time to transfer power back to the rightful king. Thorin hated this plan. It had been his suggestion, and he still hated this plan, which meant that it was shocking similar to most of his plans.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you could sound miserable about achieving everything you ever wanted,\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got from soot-smeared to grey,\u201d Thorin said. Bilbo muttered something under his breath that sounded very unkind towards Thorin\u2019s nephews. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t as if I did such a good job the last time I was king.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo dipped his washcloth in Thorin\u2019s drinking water and started scrubbing his face. \u201cThe first time I tried to steal something for you, I got the entire company captured by trolls. Who\u2019s good at a job on their first day?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPosh,\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cYou were born to be king, Thorin, and knowing what not to do is as valuable as knowing what to do. If you need help with the rest, just ask one of your faithful advisors for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Dwalin, Balin, or you,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cPower, wisdom, and common sense. What more could you need?\u201d Bilbo pointed to his face. \u201cAm I still goblin grey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPink as a rose. And about as threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo rolled his eyes. \u201cThank you, Thorin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Bilbo.\u201d</p>\n<p>The name rolled of Thorin\u2019s tongue so easily these days. At the height of his sickness, that was one thing he\u2019d thought correctly at least. Bilbo\u2019s name fit. It fit Bilbo. It fit Thorin. When he had been barely conscious after being coaxed back to the land of the living, he\u2019d murmured it like a prayer. And it worked better than any prayer Thorin had offered before. When you called on Bilbo, he actually helped.</p>\n<p>And Thorin had been right not to ask. He\u2019d learned Bilbo\u2019s name anyway, and Bilbo was none the wiser about Thorin\u2019s ignorance. He\u2019d gotten away with it, Thorin thought. He\u2019d actually gotten away with it.</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t seem right.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know your name until Balin told me outside the secret door,\u201d Thorin blurted out.</p>\n<p>Bilbo paused halfway through wringing out his washcloth. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin gritted his teeth and committed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your name. Your first name. I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo still looked like he was trying to understand what Thorin had just said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t understand, you didn\u2019t know my name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thorin pushed himself up in bed. Instinctually, Bilbo pushed him back down again. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I didn\u2019t know it until you saved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich time?\u201d Bilbo asked, staring down at Thorin in bafflement.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe first time,\u201d Thorin said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ve felt bad for a very long while. If that helps.\u201d Bilbo kept staring down at him. \u201cDwalin, Fili, and Kili were helping me secretly learn your name.\u201d Thorin paused for a moment. \u201cThey were not helpful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t joking in Laketown,\u201d Bilbo said, bewildered. \u201cWhen you said you didn\u2019t know my name, you weren\u2019t joking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin winced. \u201cI was trying to make you laugh?\u201d he offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you were also hoping that I would say my name in the process. Because you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Bilbo sat on the edge of the bed, his look of confusion unchanged. \u201cYou never called me anything but Mr. Baggins and burglar. I just thought you were simultaneously very formal and slightly rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin couldn\u2019t exactly deny that description.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask someone?\u201d Then Bilbo shook himself. \u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t ask anyone. Anyone in this party would tell me right away.\u201d Bilbo looked back at Thorin. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask me?\u201d</p>\n<p>That was the question, wasn\u2019t it? Thorin opened and closed his mouth a few times. Bilbo kept staring at him like he was the strangest thing he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI\u2019d done enough to make you feel like you didn\u2019t belong with us,\u201d Thorin said at last. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make you feel like that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bafflement didn\u2019t leave Bilbo\u2019s face at that. In fact it stayed there for a very long while. But then it slid into grin so bright that Thorin had to turn away. \u201cWell,\u201d Bilbo said, shaking his head. He might have been blushing. But on the other hand, that might have just been the last pinkness from his vigorous face washing. \u201cThat was a noble thing done very stupidly.\u201d He remembered the washcloth he was holding and started scrubbing his hands clean. \u201cSo it\u2019s perfectly in character, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>Bilbo glanced up at Thorin. \u201cI stole the one thing you valued most and spent most of the quest doing a very unflattering impression of you behind your back.\u201d He tossed the blackened washcloth in the basin behind him. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve both done things we regret regarding each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin frowned. \u201cWhat impression?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo gave Thorin such a stern look that Thorin sat up straighter. \u201cWe have merriment,\u201d Bilbo growled, \u201cwhen the mountain is ours again.\u201d Then the darkness lifted from his face and he shrugged. \u201cThat, more or less. It passed the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my kin let this happen?\u201d Thorin thought of Fili and Kili. \u201cOf course they did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour closest kin were my greatest encouragers,\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cThey really helped me master the way you spit out words you don\u2019t like. <em>Elves</em>. <em>Fun</em>. <em>Proper rest and healing</em>. It\u2019s quite cathartic, I\u2019ve been using it a lot during reconstruction councils when Balin asks me to sit in. Now everyone listens to me because they think I\u2019m a little frightening, as opposed to before when they listened because they thought that I was your very good friend. I\u2019ll have to correct them at the next council.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thorin grabbed Bilbo\u2019s arm. \u201cYou are my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo rested his hand on Thorin\u2019s. \u201cI know, Thorin. You\u2019re not subtle. And I\u2019m not mad, I promise. Whatever things we have to forgive each other for, let\u2019s forgive them. Big and small.\u201d Bilbo squeezed Thorin\u2019s hand. It was also easy with Bilbo, always. Thorin didn\u2019t trust that easiness. Nothing in his life had ever come so easily before as Bilbo Baggins\u2019 good favor. \u201cBesides, you do know my name <em>now</em>. You\u2014you do know my name now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cIt\u2019s Bilbi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo looked at him with dead eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know it\u2019s Bilbo,\u201d Thorin added after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cOr are you going to spend a year haplessly investigating whether or not my name is Bilbi Baggins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo because I\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson about asking people when I have a question,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cFor example. What is your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Bilbi.\u201d Bilbo bowed his head. \u201cBilbi Boggins at your service.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re more of a prick than I once thought,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny, that\u2019s something Dwalin was just saying about you. However, I, Bilbi Boggins, always knew you were a prick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour name is Bilbo Baggins of Bag End at the top of a little hill overlooking the street,\u201d Thorin said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like cabbage, you do like carrots, your mother told you tales of all sorts of dragons and princesses when you were young, you\u2019ve feared wolves ever since the Fell Winter, you\u2019re the bravest companion I\u2019ve ever known, and you\u2019ve already scoped out gardening plots on our mountain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m also good at sewing and bad at figures,\u201d Bilbo said, smiling. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to list everything about me, you\u2019ve a bit more to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to say that I know you.\u201d Thorin\u2019s hand was still on Bilbo\u2019s arm, nestled in the crook of his elbow. Thorin\u2019s thumb rubbed circles in Bilbo\u2019s soft skin. \u201cEven if some facts took longer to learn than they should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo wound his fingers through Thorin\u2019s. \u201cWell,\u201d Bilbo said again and shook his head and laughed. \u201cThank you.\u201d He smiled at Thorin. Thorin smiled back. \u201cYou know that your nephews know my name, right?\u201d Bilbo asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course they do now,\u201d Thorin said. And then he said, \u201cWait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe entire quest,\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cThey always called me Bilbo. Except when you were there. Then they called me Mr. Baggins, I assumed out of politeness. I\u2019m thinking it was the opposite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any descendants that you\u2019d like to make the heirs of Erebor?\u201d Thorin asked. \u201cMy own about to get killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault you didn\u2019t just ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey actively advised me not to!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you took their advice? You need me to stick around Erebor more than I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Thorin said like the answer to that should have been obvious, \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The flap to the tent flew open and Dwalin stomped in, Fili and Kili bounding in his wake. They were both about as sooty as Bilbo had been, though Dwalin looked considerably more grumpy about it and his nephews looked considerably less. \u201cTell your sister she birthed two demons,\u201d Dwalin growled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s cleaned up now,\u201d Kili said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll back where it belongs,\u201d Fili said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, we probably shouldn\u2019t have brought this much coal dust into a medical tent,\u201d Bilbo said.</p>\n<p>Dwalin snorted. \u201cThe day a little coal kills a dwarf is the day that dwarf deserves to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, very good point, Dwalin,\u201d Bilbo said. \u201cCallous but principled, I suppose. Also, what is my name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin stiffened. Fili and Kili looked like they couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cHe found out?\u201d Fili asked, beaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him,\u201d Thorin said. He stared his nephews down until their glee started to dim a little. \u201cAs you should have told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kili grabbed his brother\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s still bed-bound,\u201d he said, and they sprinted out of the tent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m disinheriting you!\u201d Thorin shouted after them. Their response sounded disturbingly like laughter.</p>\n<p>Bilbo raised his eyebrow at Dwalin. \u201cWell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt definitely starts with a B,\u201d Dwalin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you still not know?\u201d Thorin asked.</p>\n<p>Dwalin shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m a simple dwarf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe eat dinner together four nights a week,\u201d Bilbo said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Balin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bilbo snorted. \u201cI\u2019m telling Balin about every bit of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dwalin grimaced, but he didn\u2019t protest. Thorin didn\u2019t envy him the scolding he was about to get. Of course, Thorin would be getting one of his own, but maybe he could feign some severe injury halfway through it. There were very few benefits to getting stabbed and Thorin ought to make the most of the ones he got.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your name then?\u201d Dwalin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bilbi,\u201d Thorin said.</p>\n<p>Bilbo punched him in the shoulder. Thorin pushed him off the bed. It was strange, Thorin thought as Bilbo made the most offended noise possible as he hit the ground. It wasn\u2019t that this was the happiest he\u2019d ever been, or any nonsense like that. It was just that the happiness underneath his feet felt a little more secure than it had before.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, Thorin Oakenshield!\u201d Bilbo shouted from the floor as Dwalin roared with laughter.</p>\n<p>Yes. This happiness felt very secure indeed.</p>"
