  "text": "<p>The day was going well until it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d had a few particularly intense days of tests, and Izuku and his friends had decided to let off some of the tension by going out to eat at a small local diner. The place was scantily lit, sported old chairs that looked like they had been there since the pre Quirk era, sold one thing and was damn good at it, and the group had inhaled the large platter of fried seafood and accompanying sides.</p>\n<p>It was only twenty minutes in, while they sat and talked over ice cream, vanilla, the only kind the place offered, that Izuku\u2019s grasp on the conversation started to dwindle, and the appetite and good mood he\u2019d had at the beginning of the meal had left, replaced with a queasy feeling in his stomach and an odd lightheadedness he hadn\u2019t felt since Kaminari had accidentally punched him in the face unexpectedly during a training exercise.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, are you alright, kero?\u201d Tsuyu asked, watching him intently.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s ice cream lay untouched. The conversation slowed to a stop as everyone stopped to look at him, various expressions of concern mirroring Tsuyu\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel very good,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t <em>look</em> very good either,\u201d Uraraka commented, eyebrows furrowing, \u201cWas it something you ate?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019d come to this place before, and while it may look dingy at a glance, the food was good, clean and made with care, and Izuku had never had an issue with it.</p>\n<p>Tsuyu and Uraraka exchanged a glance.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould be food poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr an allergic reaction.\u201d Tsuyu added.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya.\u201d Iida said urgently, chopping the air with his hands. \u201cYou should have informed us if you had any allergies so we could have chosen a restaurant to accommodate your needs!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any allergies though?\u201d Izuku protested. He really didn\u2019t, and he genuinely had no idea what this was all coming from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His stomach rolled as another wave of nausea hit, and it must have shown on his face, as Tsuyu bluntly remarked. \u201cIt sure looks like an allergic reaction, kero.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka pulled out her phone despite Izuku\u2019s protests. \u201cI\u2019m not taking the risk Deku. I\u2019ll call you an ambulance.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you have a shellfish allergy.\u201d The doctor informed him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too serious, but it\u2019s a good thing your friends noticed in time and got you help. You should be grateful to them for that.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The air in the shifting darkness that was the vestiges\u2019 domain was more subdued than usual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYikes.\u201d Yoichi said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you imagine if after all this, all we\u2019ve fought for, it all ended because Ninth has a shellfish allergy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be quite the anticlimactic ending.\u201d Hikage agreed. \u201cWhat would happen to us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Second, blunt as always, was the one to answer. \u201cWe would die, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re already dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku was released not long after, with a warning to stay clear of any kinds of seafood for the time being until they could schedule a more comprehensive allergen test, and despite Izuku reassuring his friends via message that he was okay, they still crowded around him the day after at school, much to the annoyance of Kacchan, seated in front of him, who disliked having people near his own desk and made it clear to everybody.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Very loudly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone ignored him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay Deku!\u201d Uraraka said. \u201cThat was scary yesterday. You really didn\u2019t know you were allergic to seafood?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot until yesterday afternoon.\u201d Izuku confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck.\u201d Kacchan butted in. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any allergies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tsuyu raised an eyebrow. \u201cGreat news Midoriya. Bakugo says you\u2019re no longer allergic to shellfish. Congratulations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank? You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you really have an allergy?\u201d Kacchan said, studying him.</p>\n<p>Izuku shrugged. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku knew it wasn\u2019t uncommon for allergies to show up out of nowhere later in life, but he never thought it would happen to him. At least it wasn\u2019t a food he was particularly attached to, he rarely had seafood, so adjusting his diet to this news would not require many drastic changes. He <em>would</em> miss his mother\u2019s grilled crab dishes though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking nerd. If your mom makes any of her really good seafood dishes, tell her to send them my way since you can\u2019t eat them anymore,\u201d Kacchan declared, as if reading his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does having an allergy make me a nerd? You\u2019re lactose intolerant?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan shrugged, turning away. \u201cIt just does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Bakugo is lactose intolerant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do sympathize with Ninth. I have a shellfish allergy too.\u201d Yoichi confided. \u201cI had shellfish on a few occasions before my allergy developed and I quite liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m allergic to shellfish too, actually.\u201d Banjo said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last ones to add on were Nana and En, sounding as perplexed as all of them felt.</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at Hikage.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I never had shellfish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow.\u201d En said flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAcquiring shellfish was not high on my list of priorities at the time.\u201d Hikage said stiffly.</p>\n<p>Banjo raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat was on your list of priorities then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStrengthening One for All, surviving and not dying at the hands of All for One?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh right, I forgot about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hikage gave him an incredulous look. \u201cHow-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Nana.\u201d Yoichi said conversationally.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you happen to know if Eighth has a shellfish allergy?\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Regrettably, Nana did not know if Eighth was allergic to shellfish, even though Yoichi insisted it didn\u2019t matter to prove his theory. The details of said theory were still a mystery to the rest of them, as Yoichi\u2019s explanation of his theory consisted mostly of rapid fire mumbling and bits of seemingly random information as opposed to any actual explaining. Decades of being stuck together in the depths of One for All had not particularly improved their ability to understand Yoichi when he went on tangents like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cConspiracy theorist Yoichi is at it again.\u201d Third muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he do a lot of that?\u201d Nana asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Second and Third said at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not <em>conspiracy theories</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey you know who would probably know if Eighth has any allergies?\u201d En said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNinth?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <em> is </em>an All Might nerd.\u201d Nana agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how do you expect to ask him?\u201d Second pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSummon him in a dreamlike state to talk to him? It\u2019s not like we haven't done that before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but that takes effort and energy and doesn\u2019t work half the time and it's supposed to be reserved for <em>important</em> things. We can\u2019t call for him and be like \u2018We, the One for All vestiges are here to ask you a vital question. Is All Might allergic to shellfish\u2019\u201d.</p>\n<p>Banjo snorted. \u201cNo I think we should do exactly that.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s allergen test revealed that he was only allergic to crustaceans, which was a relief. He didn\u2019t know if he was emotionally ready to handle being allergic to something else on top of that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His class was informed of it too, as they sometimes cooked and ate meals together as a class, so that they could keep an eye out for it and possible allergens too.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s only allergic to crustaceans!\u201d Yoichi exclaimed, slamming his hands down on his seat. Not too far away, En flinched at the sound. \u201cWhat has gotten into you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi ignored the question. \u201cThose of you that mentioned having an allergy, were you allergic to mollusks too or just crustaceans?\u201d</p>\n<p>Banjo and Nana both had a crustacean only allergy, En simply told them he had never bothered to check.</p>\n<p>Hikage shrugged. \u201cI still don\u2019t know. My bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHikage you are fucking up my data.\u201d Yoichi told him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking up your data? What about Second and Third?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not part of the study.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get any information out of them, they just say things are classified whenever I try to ask them questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I not be part of the study too?\u201d En asked.</p>\n<p>Nana interrupted then to tell them all to be nice to Yoichi and everyone grudgingly quieted down as he spoke again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI also am only allergic to crustaceans. Don\u2019t you guys think it\u2019s weird that we all have the same allergy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d Banjo agreed.</p>\n<p>Third shrugged. \u201cMaybe having a shellfish allergy is a prerequisite for getting One for All.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes literally no sense.\u201d Hikage told him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what other explanation do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one.\u201d Yoichi said before Hikage could reply. \u201cI don\u2019t have much information to go off of, but I think it has some foundation to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>En raised an eyebrow and Nana crossed her arms expectantly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoichi looked almost apologetic. \u201cYou know how we pass our quirk along to the next user? One for All, and now all the other ones quirks that Ninth can potentially access? It\u2019s literally kinda our thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. What if it\u2019s not the only thing being passed down?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a beat of silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>hell</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They tossed around ideas for a bit, and unfortunately, the idea did seem to have some basis to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis explains my white hair actually.\u201d Hikage mused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhite hair?\u201d Banjo questioned.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody in my immediate family has white hair.\u201d Hikage pointed to Yoichi. \u201cBut he does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ohh</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you just never questioned it?\u201d En asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I just assumed the stress from my super anxiety quirk was the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, then why don\u2019t <em>we</em> have white hair then?\u201d Nana pointed out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a beat of silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it's because Banjo is bald and it didn\u2019t transfer past him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Banjo smacked Hikage.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe an allergy almost took you out.\u201d Kacchan swiped out experimentally with a quick jab, testing the distance between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you worried about me?\u201d Izuku teased. It probably wasn\u2019t the best idea to talk while they were sparring, but he and Kacchan always ended up doing so, and in Izuku\u2019s opinion, it was improving his stamina and ability to multitask, even though according to Mr. Aizawa\u2019s mutterings, it was better for all of them if he didn\u2019t improve that last one. Whatever that meant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course the fuck not. I just don\u2019t want you dying before I can beat you for first place in the hero rankings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of answering, Kacchan kicked one leg out from under him. Izuku stumbled momentarily. \u201cThat would be a pretty dumb way to go,\u201d he agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure would. Dumbass.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost as dumb as that time you ate too much ice cream despite knowing you couldn\u2019t handle that much dairy and got a stomachache so-\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan let off an explosion in his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Nana suggested that to get to the bottom of what traits they had potentially passed down and inherited they needed to get personal by talking about themselves, which wasn\u2019t a suggestion that went down particularly well with the four emotionally constipated of the seven ghosts (aka: En, Hikage, Second and Third).</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon guys, it\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Banjo encouraged.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you conspire with Nana and Yoichi. Is this your attempt to get us to do group therapy you three because if so it\u2019s not working.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They did end up tentatively drafting a board with various patterns mapped out linking various users.</p>\n<p>Third and Second were fantastically tight lipped about the whole thing, but they did get some information out of them too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t really think of anything else relevant about me besides what you already wrote on the board.\u201d Third said unhelpfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing at all?\u201d Yoichi pressed.</p>\n<p>Third shrugged. \u201cI mean, I had pain in my knee after I broke my kneecap when I was a kid whenever I used my quirk. Does that count?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat depends, did anyone else have quirk related knee pain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Hikage said, looking torn. \u201cIs <em>that</em> why my knee always hurt when I when I used my quirk? Do you know how long I spent looking for the source of that? Was that your fault? What the fuck? Did you guys not get that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone else shook their head.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy knee hurt too.\u201d Banjo volunteered.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh coo-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that's only because I also broke it so it\u2019s probably unrelated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we can count it then.\u201d Yoichi absently passed the marker between his hands. \u201cIf it\u2019s just the two of you. Might not even be connected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hikage looked distraught.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe shellfish one is definitely the most consistent. As is the fact that half of us are astigmatic in our left eye.\u201d En said, surveying the board.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of left, are any of you left-handed?\u201d Banjo asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAmbidextrous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Second sighed. \u201cYes. Add it to the board.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>They were two weeks into their rescue hero training and Izuku was doing concerningly well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were many kinds of heroes, and most people, with few exceptions, came into UA with their gaze deadset on being a spotlight hero. Nonetheless, students usually showed interest or an affinity for the work typical of a particular hero subtype in their years at UA, and the school provided training in all areas a hero might need to cover to help students figure out what they were best suited for.</p>\n<p>Versatility, after all, was one trait of a good hero.</p>\n<p>They were currently working on wilderness survival skills, such as providing medical attention with limited resources, starting fires, identifying edible plants, and so on, all things Izuku had never had experience with (he had gone camping exactly once in his life and was only sixty-two percent sure it had actually happened and he hadn\u2019t imagined it.)</p>\n<p>So there was no reason for him to be decent, let alone <em>good</em> at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe jagged edges on the leaves aren\u2019t as spaced out as they should be.\u201d He sat crossed legged in the grass with a small group of his classmates. \u201cI think this is the plant Mr. Aizawa told us to be careful about, the really poisonous one that\u2019s really easy to confuse with other species?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d he added again hesitantly.</p>\n<p>Kirishima consulted his notes again, holding up a picture and comparing it to the plant in Izuku\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I never would have noticed. You\u2019re so good at this bro.\u201d Kirishima said admiringly.</p>\n<p>Izuku blushed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They had been divided into different groups, each given a handful of different leaves and berries, and had been instructed to work as a group, label them all correctly, and turn in their work by the end of the day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Aizawa had given them permission to do their work wherever they pleased, so Izuku\u2019s group had opted to sit outside in the garden while they worked through their material and slowly identify each plant.</p>\n<p>Shouji bent down to cross out their previous guess and relabelled the leaf.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get so good at this Midoriya?\u201d Ashido asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not actually sure?\u201d he admitted. It did happen sometimes for him to remember tidbits of information but not be able to recall where he knew them from, but he felt like he would have remembered studying something like this before. \u201cI might have picked it up in middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ashido shrugged. \u201cWherever you picked it up from, it\u2019s great for us. We\u2019re going to be done with this so fast.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>While being able to identify plants was something Izuku might have realistically picked up on his own and just forgotten about, being able to make an emergency shelter, well. Was not.</p>\n<p>\u201cKaminari, your shelter looks like it would fall over if I stared at it too hard. Ashido, not bad, but your knots are sloppy. Midoriya-\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Aizawa gave it a considering look. \u201cDecent.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if on cue, Kaminari\u2019s shelter collapsed.</p>\n<p>Kaminari sagged, bending down in a feeble attempt to pick it back up. Izuku walked over to give him a hand while Mr. Aizawa went on to crush other of his classmate\u2019s confidence in their handiwork.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so sure I had gotten it.\u201d Kaminari complained. \u201cHow am I so bad at this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing too bad.\u201d Izuku said encouragingly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard if you\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which begs the question, how was <em>he</em> doing well?</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents were never into camping as a kid. At the time, I never cared for it, but now I almost wish they had been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nodded sympathetically.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you Midoriya? Are you like Bakugo, who, from what he\u2019s told us, went camping so often he might as well have grown up in a tent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to his house. It\u2019s definitely not a tent.\u201d Izuku said absently. \u201cBut no, my mom isn\u2019t big on camping either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kaminari deflated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Izuku felt compelled to apologize for some reason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Ashido yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to fix the knots. If I use acid to try to weld the rope together do you think it will work? Or at least get points for creativity?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kaminari said.</p>\n<p>Izuku shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is definitely Hikage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hikage looked almost pleased at that. \u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I was skeptical about this quirk passing thing first, but there does seem to be a pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond, you were skeptical, do you have no faith in me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Second ignored Yoichi.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this mean each person who gets One for All will just be a mish mash of the previous ones? That\u2019s slightly terrifying.\u201d Nana said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot necessarily?\u201d Banjo pointed out. \u201cSome stuff passed onto every person, other skipped people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cThere has to be a rhyme or reason to this thing. Like genetics. Shit is wack and seems random but there <em>has</em> to be a pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like this should be more straightforward than genetics. Quirks are supposed to make sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cName one quirk that has ever made sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hikage gave it a second then gave up. \u201cYea that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI still think Banjo\u2019s overwhelming bald genes overtook the white ones.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t stop there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every now and then, Izuku would show proficiency in one thing or the other, seemingly at random.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He started wondering if he was imagining things, but oftentimes his classmates would be present as unknowing witnesses to the feat. After fumbling for an explanation the first few times his curious (and sometimes a little jealous) classmates asked, he\u2019d taken to adopting the middle school excuse to cover his unexplained skill.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doubted anyone truly believed he\u2019d actually picked up all these things in middle school, but it did stop them from asking further. Kacchan <em>was</em> eyeing him more and more suspiciously every day though.</p>\n<p>He almost started believing his own lie, because really, what reason would there be for him to suddenly be able to do such things? Nothing about this made sense.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Nana sympathized with him. \u201cPoor kid.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve given him imposter syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is he getting so many traits anyway? He seems to be more affected than the rest of us were. Or were we all so heavily influenced without knowing it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEn is right, Ninth does seem to be more affected than us. I don\u2019t recall having random skills pop up out of nowhere when Hikage passed One for All onto me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s also the only person who can use all our quirks, at least, theoretically.\u201d Nana pointed out. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s intensified and he\u2019s getting the brunt of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf One for All\u2019s power has increased, that would also explain why he kept breaking his bones in the beginning.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>I just assumed that was because he has weak bones- wait oh my god. What if the reason he kept breaking his bones is because he inherited my weak constitution?\u201d Yoichi said in horror.</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence, then Second snorted. \u201cNice one Yoichi.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough trait mapping for today.\u201d Nana pried the whiteboard marker out of Third\u2019s hand before he could write 'Yoichi\u2019s weak ass bones.' under Ninth\u2019s column.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Somehow, it only occurred to Izuku that his new development of random skills could be related to One for All upon meeting All Might in the infirmary, while he was getting a quick check-up after getting thrown around a bit too much during training. Out of sight, out of mind, he supposed. And while he did use his quirk daily in training exercises at school, it had somehow slipped his mind that there was someone else who had gone through the experience of having his own quirk who might be able to shed some light on the strange string of skills he\u2019d acquired since entering UA. It was worth a shot.</p>\n<p>Izuku lazily rolled his wrist in a circle while he formulated a question. It and his knee had been bothering him particularly, even after Recovery Girl used her quirk on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might-\u201d he began hesitantly, \u201cCan I ask you a possibly stupid question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no such thing as a stupid question! Ask away my boy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you first received One for All, did you experience any- Did you get any new skills you didn\u2019t have beforehand, out of nowhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>All Might\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.</p>\n<p>Izuku pressed on. \u201cBecause weird things have been happening lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>He went more in detail, explaining the odd series of events which, taken individually, Izuku would\u2019ve brushed off, but as a whole, were quite peculiar indeed.</p>\n<p>By the end of it, All Might was leaning back in his chair, a thoughtful frown on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do think I know what you\u2019re talking about. I didn\u2019t have as many changes as you are experiencing, I never developed any allergies for example, but there were a few strange things that I brushed off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Izuku said excitedly, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s related to One for All?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is possible.\u201d All Might said gravely. \u201cOne for All is a peculiar quirk, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s more to it than what I was told.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did it take them a few weeks to notice what we didn\u2019t figure out in decades?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re terrible detectives.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEighth didn't even get the shellfish allergy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I don\u2019t have that one either.\u201d Second spoke up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve voluntarily offered information about yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn't break his bones using his quirk either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNana, where did you even find this boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrowing hands with a mugger twice his size.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea that checks out.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>All Might:</strong> midoriya my boy</p>\n<p><strong>All might:</strong> I just remembered that my mentor, Nana, was also allergic to shellfish</p>\n<p><strong>All Might:</strong> i think your theory has merit\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> oh!! That\u2019s cool, thank you!!</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It became a slight problem when Izuku stopped being surprised by a new skill and would just show it off almost unconsciously. It was a combination of his tendency to mumble, his tendency to do things on autopilot and the bad luck of having the class be particularly quiet while Izuku muttered out the translation for a text on the board in a language he did not speak.</p>\n<p>Or well, should not be able to speak.</p>\n<p>Aizawa raised an eyebrow, almost imperceptibly. \u201cThanks to Midoriya, who has kindly translated for us-\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flushed, sinking in on himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was unaware you spoke Spanish Deku!\u201d Uraraka said brightly. \u201cThat\u2019s cool! How did you learn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, you know. Middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not for the first time, Kacchan eyed him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d Nana said. \u201cWho is it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence.</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at each other.</p>\n<p>Banjo shook his head, and En\u2019s gaze flitted quizzically at the others.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he <em>did</em> learn it in middle scho-\u201d Hikage began.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond.\u201d Yoichi leaned against a chair, scrutinizing his successor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second let out a pained groan. \u201cThis is the worst way for you guys to find out things about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you speak Spanish??\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are learning such wonderful things today.\u201d Yoichi said gleefully.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, until this whole thing, I never realized how little we know about each other.\u201d En said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed. We used to just spend time here shit talking whoever the current user was.\u201d Third contemplated. \u201cI kind of preferred it that way.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you guys talked shit about us?\u201d Banjo asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for sure.\u201d Hikage said at the same time Yoichi said \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s- alright let\u2019s not unpack that. We don\u2019t shit talk Ninth though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh he\u2019s a kid I\u2019m not going to talk shit about a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku.\u201d Kacchan said in lieu of a greeting. \u201cWhat the fuck is up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Izuku said way too brightly.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist this kid is a bad liar. Who did he get that from? Yoichi? I\u2019m betting it\u2019s Yoichi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey stop blaming me for everything, the bad lying thing is his own thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kacchan was onto him. He was unsurprisingly direct with his line of questioning, immediately asking about Izuku\u2019s bizarre array of new skills who he, out of everyone else in the class, knew he hadn\u2019t really picked up in middle school (with a lot more swearing involved than was strictly necessary).</p>\n<p>Izuku really didn\u2019t have a proper explanation for him either, but he offered his and All Might\u2019s theory that it might be related to his quirk.</p>\n<p>Kacchan rocked back on his heels, looking perplexed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck Deku? Your quirk made you able to speak Spanish? What kind of bullshit is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a hypothesis for now. And if it makes you feel better, I can no longer eat cilantro.\u201d Izuku offered.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich of you motherfuckers got the cilantro soap gene I swear to God.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl\u2019s face was kind as Izuku sat once again in the infirmary.</p>\n<p>His wrist pain had faded since his last time here. The pain in his knee had not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI took a look, but there really seems to be nothing wrong dear. Have you had this kind of ache before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku flexed his knee, testing it out. \u201cNot really. I switched to using my legs more because my arms were injured so I was really careful about not overdoing it, I swear. I didn\u2019t injure it or anything either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Recovery Girl hummed. \u201cThat is odd. Keep an eye on it for me dear, won\u2019t you? We don\u2019t want it getting worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s knee had been aching for over two weeks now, not enough for it to be that serious of a problem but enough for it to be a consistent annoyance whenever he used his quirk. It faded out when he walked around normally, but activating One for All seemed to set it off, which was a problem, as when he used One for All were the times he needed to move around and react the most.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It came and went, and the pain ebbed and was barely noticeable at times, but Aizawa had told him to go have it checked out anyway \u201cgiven his track record.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHE GOT THE BAD KNEE TRAIT.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHikage-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019M NOT THE ONLY ONE.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really should not be happy about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is that transferable anyway?\u201d En interrupted. \u201cI understand the shellfish allergy, but learned skills like languages and physical problems that arose with time like Third\u2019s bad knee, how are those passed on? It makes no sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it kinda does actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi propped himself up. \u201cOne for All has two aspects. Being able to be passed on, and <em>stockpiling</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne for All gets stronger with every user because the previous user has cultivated the power and increased it. The second could easily apply to other traits, such as learned skills during one\u2019s lifetime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would hardly consider a knee injury a skill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi shrugged. \u201cOne for All isn\u2019t sentient-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we then, chopped liver?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant that it\u2019s not like the quirk can choose which traits are \u2018good\u2019 and which are \u2018bad\u2019. A bad knee could have been learned muscle memory about how to assemble a gun. One for All just picks up on things and passes them along.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYoichi. This was probably your original quirk, wasn\u2019t it? Passing down physical characteristics, learned skills, traits, and so on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku gripped the corners of the sink, staring hard at his reflection. He\u2019d thought it had been just a trick of the light at first, but over the past few weeks, it had become more and more evident until it was now impossible to ignore.</p>\n<p>His hair was turning white.</p>\n<p>It was just his roots, obviously, the rest of his hair was still green, but there was now a clear section near his scalp where the green had rapidly faded to a shocking white.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well this might as well happen. Maybe it was the stress.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, mom?\u201d he called.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s mom also seemed rather perplexed by the new development. She told him she\u2019d had a friend whose hair had also changed color during middle school, but not this drastically, and over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still young though, so I guess it can happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled and brushed a strand of hair out of his eyes. \u201cYour father had white hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, nevermind. Looks like the white hair gene made it through after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Izuku ultimately decided not to dye it. His mother had proposed it, but Izuku didn\u2019t have the time or energy to routinely touch up on his roots, especially when his hair was showing no sign of going back to green.</p>\n<p>Besides, he kind of liked the white roots look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s friends noticed the hair eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uraraka and Tsuyu told him he looked cool, Kirishima and Kaminari mourned the loss of what they had referred to as \u2018The Traffic Light Trio\u2019 and Iida also acknowledged the new look.</p>\n<p>Kacchan was blunt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNerd. What the fuck is up with your hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s turning white.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan stared at him. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shrugged helplessly. \u201cYea look I don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> Hey All Might\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> so with uh</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> recent developments</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> I\u2019m going to start charting the things I think I\u2019m getting from One for All.</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> Would you mind telling me what exactly you noticed when you got One for All, so I can do a comparison between the stuff I\u2019ve noticed and the stuff that affected you too?</p>\n<p><strong>Izuku:</strong> and anything you can remember about your mentor, Nana? If not that\u2019s okay too! I just figured the more information we have, the better.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>All Might:</strong> Of course!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, maybe the trait passing down thing is why the kid can do such a good impression of Eighth. He inherited his face.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I'm pretty sure that one is just practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYoichi.\u201d Hikage spoke. \u201cYou once said that One for All doesn\u2019t decide what traits get passed down, as it isn\u2019t sentient.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean yea. We are, but we don\u2019t control that part of the quirk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we could?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Yea we. Hm.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>One for All was a pulsing, ever present force in that background, easy to get used to but impossible to ignore. It was the sheer power that kept them all together.</p>\n<p>Their own individual quirks had joined it, recently, all balled up and tangling together, ready to be used, once Ninth was ready for it.</p>\n<p>Skill sets were more subtle. They weren\u2019t quite there, not as tangibly as the quirks were, but <em>surely</em> there had to be a way to access them, to pass them along.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Banjo was of the opinion that they shouldn\u2019t force it. They tried for a bit, brainstorming and scratching their heads over it, but got no closer to figuring out how to pass traits onto Ninth on <em>purpose.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThe kid has enough on his hands on his own.\u201d Banjo was saying. \u201cWithout throwing this in too. Besides, we\u2019ve been at this for a while. Frankly, I think it\u2019s out of our control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m with Banjo. Would we even be helping? Are we ruining him by forcing traits he doesn't know onto him? Or are they his to begin with? Does One for All erase people\u2019s individuality?\u201d</p>\n<p>Second summoned a blanket with a groan, which was what he did whenever the others got philosophical, and Hikage followed suit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou spent your entire life as a hermit and you never spent any time being philosophical?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly En. I had plenty of time in my life to be philosophical. I\u2019ve had enough of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku's hair grew longer and whiter. It was a stark difference from his former hair, the pale color framing his face differently compared to the darker green.</p>\n<p>His classmates and teachers took the change gracefully, though a few did ask him if he intended to change his hero costume color to match his hair.</p>\n<p>Izuku hadn\u2019t even really considered it until they had brought it up, but didn\u2019t spend too much time pondering the matter. He liked his green costume, and it <em>was</em> the costume his mom had made him, so he had no intention to change it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Hikage brushed his own white hair out of his face. \u201cYou know, with the white hair, he kinda reminds me of someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, he looks like Yoichi.\u201d Hikage insisted.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm I guess I can kinda see it.\u201d Banjo said, though he didn\u2019t sound very convinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does seem to have picked up a lot of Yoichi\u2019s traits, in particular, out of all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Yoichi started coughing furiously into his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing. There may be a reason for that actually. One that is uh, unrelated to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Third shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not Yoichi he looks like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t see the resemblance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe looks like-\u201d Third paled. \u201cHe looks like his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNinth has no siblings. And if he did, it would make sense for them to look alike?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot <em>Ninth\u2019s</em> nonexistent brother.\u201d Second snapped. \u201cYoichi\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn't you tell us?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll for One is way too old to have a son that young.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoichi held his hands up in front of him, overwhelmed by the barrage of questions. \u201cI <em>did</em> tell you guys- or well, I told Second and Third.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone momentarily stopped harassing Yoichi to turn towards Second and Third.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were <em>joking</em>.\u201d Second burst out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I-\u201d</p>\n<p>Confusion erupted again.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It took a good while for everyone to calm down, and even longer for everyone to fully accept the news. Banjo and Nana had gotten over it pretty quickly, while Second, Third, En and Hikage were currently a good manifestation of four of the five stages of grief.</p>\n<p>\u201cNinth is All for One\u2019s son.\u201d Hikage\u2019s head was in his hands. \u201cWe\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is a really good kid though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m All for One\u2019s brother? Should I be offended? This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second stared blankly off into the distance.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cClass, today we're going to learn how to assemble a gun. Despite quirk usage being very prevalent guns are still very danger-<em>Midoriya how did you do that.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku froze, holding up an assembled gun. Uh. \u201cMiddle school.\u201d he said reflexively.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was an interesting pause after that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean-\u201d he stammered.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Izuku caught Kacchan\u2019s eye and mouthed help.</p>\n<p>Kacchan stared emptily at Aizawa. \u201cDeku used to shoot people in middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- what, no I- <em>Kacchan</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know we established that we can influence the traits Ninth gets but that was extremely funny. Who do we have to thank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond.\u201d Yoichi said. \u201cHe tried to shoot me when we first met. I have no doubt he can use a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlternatively, Third. He actually did shoot me when we first met. Good times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Second is the bad shot and Third is a good shot. We will have to see if Ninth can hit a target to determine who he got it from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to murder all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond we just established you\u2019re the bad shot. How are you going to hit us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Second lunged at Banjo and the two went down in a scuffle.</p>\n<p>Nana sighed.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Aizawa pulled Izuku to the side momentarily. \u201cPersonally I could not care less but per school protocol I need to ask. Did you shoot people in middle school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat seems like a very specific thing to be in a high school protocol.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean have you seen what goes down in this high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFollow up question. Why do you know how to shoot a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Aizawa raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s muscle memory.\u201d Izuku mulled.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuscle memory.\u201d Mr. Aizawa repeated flatly.</p>\n<p>That probably wasn\u2019t the right thing to say either.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s part of my quirk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour power based quirk lets you assemble guns?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s haunted.\u201d Izuku said honestly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not sure, it\u2019s muscle memory and your quirk is haunted?\u201d Mr. Aizawa summed up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBasically yea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mr. Aizawa sighed. \u201cAlright, you can go.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean he\u2019s not wrong on any of those counts.\u201d</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of excuse was that?\u201d Izuku hissed to the side after Mr. Aizawa had left.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kacchan snapped back. \u201cIt was better than your stammering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo it wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kacchan clicked his tongue in annoyance, looking away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeku used to shoot people in middle school?\u201d Izuku repeated, his face burning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Fuck, did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck do you come up with an excuse for you being able to assemble a gun? Also you could've just not assembled it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku had nothing to say to that. He\u2019d seen the pieces on the table and had idly started putting them together and before he knew it he was holding a gun. \u201cThat's a fair point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck yea it is. Next time I\u2019ll say something worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't know what\u2019s worse than you saying I shot people in middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh that\u2019s a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!!\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Eventually the new traits Izuku had received dwindled down as he slowly figured them all out.</p>\n<p>His notebook, which he\u2019d initially spent hours annotating observations into, slowly became less and less used, if only to consult old entries on his new abilities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes sense that he\u2019d figure them all out eventually.\u201d Yoichi said, looking dejected. \u201cIt was kind of fun while it lasted to see what would pop up next though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder what he\u2019ll pass onto his successor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow down there Third.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully something better than what I got. All I got was knee pain and an allergy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHikage you don\u2019t even know if you got the allergy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEmotionally I have decided I did. I need something to blame Yoichi for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean the white hair is right there.\u201d Banjo pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys are my successors. I\u2019m disowning you all.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
