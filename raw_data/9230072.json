  "text": "<p>For as long as she had been a Luthor, Lena had been trained\u2013no\u2013<em>conditioned</em> to always be composed. Whether it\u2019s a drink spilling on her dress, an uppity board member trying to mansplain her own company, or an assassination attempt; Lena had long since become a master of always remaining as calm, cool, and collected as one could be.</p>\n<p>But right now even her skills are being pushed to their limits.</p>\n<p>It all started around 9 on a Friday night.</p>\n<p>It had been a good day; the few meetings she\u2019d had were blissfuly short and efficient, she\u2019d had little trouble focusing on her own work, and no one had tried to attack L-Corp, or herself, throughout the entire day. Truly one of the better days Lena had had since relocating to National City</p>\n<p>So of course Murphy\u2019s Law dictated that <em>something</em> was bound to happen.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d sent Jess home hours ago and was just about to pack up when she heard a thump from outside her window.</p>\n<p>Turning away from her desk the brunette saw nothing but the glitter of the city\u2019s skyline, but her curiosity had her out of her seat and onto her balcony before she could think better of it.</p>\n<p>Standing at the railing Lena looked about but couldn\u2019t see anything that may have made a noise until she looked down-</p>\n<p>Straight into a pair of bright blue eyes.</p>\n<p>Lena yelped and jumped back from the railing\u2013though she would deny it until her dying day.</p>\n<p>Forcing herself to breathe normally, Lena watched as the eyes\u2013and naturally the head attached to them\u2013began to rise up and over the railing before the entire body of none other than a certain blonde hero landed on her balcony with what Lena could only call a \u201cplop\u201d.</p>\n<p>Now, Lena had known, or at the very least <em>suspected</em>, that the sunny reporter was in fact the Girl of Steel; in addition she had a running theory that a great deal of the city\u2019s population knew as well, and were simply too enamored with the blonde to out her. She also understood that there were a myriad of reasons for why the superhero had yet to tell Lena her secret (reasons that ranged from the painless \u201cwe haven\u2019t known eachother long\u201d to the heart-wrenching \u201cI am a Luthor\u201d).</p>\n<p>Lena had hoped one day Kara would deem her worthy enough to entrust her with her whole identity.</p>\n<p>She just never imagined it would be like <em>this.</em></p>\n<p>Because the person who had just staggered onto her balcony\u2013the balcony located <em>several</em> <em>stories</em> above the streets of National City\u2013was most <em>definitely</em> looking less like Supergirl and more like Kara Danvers. The blonde was in her usual work attire of a blue button-up and slacks, but her hair was a mess of braids, her glasses horridly askew, the eyes behind them glassy, and her shirt was half undone revealing the crest of her crime-fighting outfit.</p>\n<p>All in all: she looked like a hot mess.</p>\n<p>\u201cLena!\u201d Kara crows joyously. \u201cI found you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure did,\u201d Lena replied, smiling at her friend\u2019s antics, though still a bit concerned about her attire. \u201cWhat brings to L-Corp on such a lovely night?\u201d</p>\n<p>The blonde smiled dopily (and didn\u2019t Lena\u2019s heart just melt) at the CEO before seeming to snap out of her mild daze with an \u2018oh right\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cI came to tell you about your eyes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy eyes?\u201d the brunette chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"They\u2019re fantabulous!\u201d Kara slurred, throwing her arms (and nearly the rest of her) in the air and Lena finally noticed the bottle clutched in one of her hands. It was a long, dark blue container, with no label save for a strange symbol embossed onto the glass itself.</p>\n<p>The notes she had read on Kryptonians (she might not share her brother\u2019s hatred for aliens but she did share his curiosity) had indicated that the species was incapable of becoming intoxicated on anything cultivated on Earth.</p>\n<p>\u2018That must be some kind of alien alcohol,\u2019 Lena concluded in her head. \u2018A strong brew if it\u2019s enough to bypass a Kryptonian\u2019s high metabolism. How much has she had?!\u2019</p>\n<p>The CEO was snapped out of her worried musings of a drunk Supergirl unleashed upon the city by said hero beginning to ramble in an admittedly adorable fashion.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour eyes are like the twin moons of Zagara. Have you ever been there? It\u2019s this <em>gorgeous</em> planet almost completely covered in thick lush forests. I used to love visiting with my father and sitting in one of the observatories above the canopy and ju-just take in the scenery at night. The moons were the best Lena! You know why?</p>\n<p>\u201cCause-cause they weren\u2019t bluish white like Earth\u2019s moon\u2013no. Not-not that there\u2019s anything wrong with your moon. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a good moony-moon. But Zagara\u2019s moons?! Top notch! They\u2019re this greenish color but not like a greeny-green like a leaf or a Green Martian.\u201d The blonde began pacing back and forth on the balcony while her audience tried to keep up with what she was saying. Martians?</p>\n<p>\u201cThough I do think J\u2019onn is a nice shade of green, which isn\u2019t something you\u2019d usually think about a person, but it\u2019s true! Anyway, no they aren\u2019t-they\u2019re not white; they\u2019re this like, icy, bluey, kind of green. Just like your eyes! And I was sitting with Monny at-at the bar and we were talking about the planets we\u2019d visited before coming here and which ones we missed the most besides our ho-homes and I thought of Zagara and its moons and how they\u2019re like your eyes and I had to tell you-I had to tell you that, Lena!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me that my eyes-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat your eyes are like moons and oceans and forests and stars all rolled into one! I had to tell you so I grabbed this bottle here-which is delicious by the way but don\u2019t-don\u2019t drink it cause you\u2019re human and it will kill you and I don\u2019t want that-I grabbed this and I flew here and I\u2019m here and now I\u2019m going to tell you that Lena-\u201c</p>\n<p>Kara jolted towards her suddenly and firmly but gently grabbed her shoulders so that she could look Lena straight in the face and say, \u201cLena, you have the prettiest eyes I have ever seen. <em>Hiccup</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two decades worth of training deserted Lena at the sight of the blonde\u2019s serious, if a bit flushed, face. Her mouth fell open slightly as she struggled to comprehend that Kara; Kara the humanoid puppy, Kara the alien goddess, Kara the angel literally flung out of space\u2013decided to fly gods know how far across the city, <em>drunk</em>, just to tell her, Lena Luthor, that she had pretty eyes and wax poetic about said eyes.</p>\n<p>\u2018What is my life?\u2019 she pondered.</p>\n<p>So stunned was Lena that she almost didn\u2019t notice Kara release her hold on her shoulders, bid her a slurred but enthusiastic good-bye, and began to amble her way back to the railing like she was going to take off.</p>\n<p>Snapping back into the situation, Lena cried out \u201cWait!\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara paused half crouched for take off, promptly falling over, but she remained on the balcony and turned to Lena with a 'yes?' expression on her face.</p>\n<p>Concerned at the prospect of the personification of a humanoid wrecking ball flying unchecked through the city (dressed as her mild manner alter ego no less), Lena thought quickly for a way to keep the blonde with her and out of trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I\u2026I actually <em>haven\u2019t</em> been to Zagara. Could you, maybe, stay for a while and tell me more?\u201d she asked, almost shyly, her fingers crossed.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s immediately glad she asked because at the request Kara absolutely <em>beamed</em> at her, and with no coaxing rose up from the balcony floor to stumble her way towards Lena\u2019s couch, already gushing about the trees and the wildlife \u201cand the flowers, Lena! They have the bestest flowers!\u201d</p>\n<p>As she walked by, the brunette noticed that Kara\u2019s cape was in fact half sticking out the back of her shirt, and wondered what she had just gotten herself into.</p>\n<p>Three hours and <em>several</em> jugs of water later, Kara finally succumbed to\u2026whatever it was she\u2019d been drinking and fell asleep. Lena had poured the remains of the bottle down the drain as soon as she could get it away from the blonde and she swears it took off a bit of the chrome finish and probably unclogged her plumbing as well.</p>\n<p>Situating the reporter as comfortably as she could on the couch (difficult when said reporter can usually only be moved when she wants to be; it was like trying to wrangle a bean-bag filled with lead beads), Lena did the only thing she could do.</p>\n<p>She cracked the password on Kara\u2019s phone and called the contact labeled \u201cAlex &lt;3\u201d.</p>\n<p>Alex would like to state for the record that she did not sign up for this shit.</p>\n<p>(Yes, technically she did when she agreed to work for the DEO but that was before Kara came out and things.)</p>\n<p>It was after midnight, she\u2019d finally located Mon-El, drunk and flirting with a blue girl at the alien bar par usual, only to find out that her sister\u2013her <em>baby lightweight of a drinker sister</em>\u2013had taken off from said bar HOURS ago, after having God know how many shots of God knows what.</p>\n<p>She had half a mind to take a lead pipe to certain parts of Mon-El\u2019s anatomy. J\u2019onn would understand.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d wrestled the half-wit, man baby into her car and is about to call her sister when her screen lit up with Kara\u2019s name and the picture of them snuggled on the couch.</p>\n<p>Breathing a sigh of relief she answered, \u201cKara, thank god. Where the hell are you?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena flinched. The elder Danvers did not sound happy. She\u2019d probably realized her sister was missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Lena, actually, and your sister is currently passed out on the couch in my office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLena? Couch? How\u2019d you get her phone?\u201d Alex asked, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI borrowed it because I can\u2019t very well leave a drunk alien passed out on my couch overnight no matter how indestructible she is. The custodians would have a fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlien-wha! That\u2019s-she\u2019s not\u2026.\u201d Lena can actually feel the moment the agent admits defeat and sighs, \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve suspected for a while\u2026your sister is a terrible liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d Alex groused.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what really sealed it is the fact that she flew up to my balcony, still mostly dressed as Kara and not Supergirl. Though I will admit her cape sticking out the back of her shirt was absolutely adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for the love of\u2026\u201d the older sister sighed and mumbled something about \u2018drunk puppies\u2019 and \u2018so much paperwork\u2019 before she started speaking to Lena again. \u201cYou said she\u2019s passed out on your couch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I managed to get her talking about the planets she\u2019d seen before coming to Earth. I didn\u2019t want her flying in this condition; I don\u2019t even want to think about what damaged she may have done just getting here.\u201d</p>\n<p>A door slammed on Alex\u2019s end of the call, followed by the roar of an engine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way right now. Dare I ask, what was she doing at L-Corp anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena blushed; grateful the agent wasn\u2019t actually there to see her.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhem, apparently she and\u2026\u201dMonny\u201d, I think his name was? They were talking and Kara said that my eyes reminded her of the \u201ctwin moons of Zagara\u201d and she decided that I absolutely needed to know this so she flew over to tell me just that\u2026.only in that very long, very cute, ramblely way that she does.\u201d</p>\n<p>The line was silent for a few moments before Alex replied, \u201c\u2026My sister flew halfway across the city to tell you that you have eyes that look like moons?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery pretty moons, apparently,\u201d again, Lena was glad they weren\u2019t face timing; she could feel her face becoming redder and redder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now she\u2019s asleep on your couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn your office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompletely smashed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena\u2019s patience snapped. Danvers\u2019 women apparently had a knack for making her lose her composure.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes!</em> And I had a heck of a time getting her to stay there, Agent Danvers. Do you know how Kara is when she\u2019s drunk?! She acts like even more of a puppy than usual! One second she\u2019s comparing my skin to these seashells found on planet so-and-so and the next she\u2019s halfway across the room headed towards the balcony, <em>determined</em> to find me a seashell so that I can see for myself! My shoes left skid marks on the floor from where she dragged me along before realizing I\u2019d grabbed her! <em>Skid marks</em>, Danvers!</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on getting that bottle out of her hands! I still don\u2019t know how she held onto it so hard without breaking it! I do however know that whatever was in it would be worth a fortune if marketed as a drain cleaner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrain cleaner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Drain cleaner</em>. And then there was the moment she realized she was still dressed as \u201cKara\u201d and not \u201cSupergirl\u201d so she tried to finish undressing herself. Which would have been fine except that she kept going and very nearly stripped all the way down before I managed to stop her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t!\u201d Alex gasped.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe did! I now know that Supergirl flies around saving people while wearing panties with small kittens on them. <em>Kittens</em>, Danvers! <em>Kittens</em>! Do you have any idea how freaking adorable that is! To know that this actual cinnamon roll is in charge of protecting the city?! I could barely restrain myself from hugging her <em>before</em>, never mind while knowing now what an absolute sweetheart she\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>A strange gurgling noise was coming over the line. It took Lena a few seconds to figure out exactly what it was.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Agent Danvers. Stop laughing at me <em>right now and come get your stinking cute sister! MY SELF CONTROL CAN ONLY LAST SO LONG, DAMN IT!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Kara woke up slowly and with much grumbling.</p>\n<p>It felt like a small elephant was tap dancing on her head.</p>\n<p>Rolling out of her bed, cursing Mon-El\u2019s name all the while, the blonde stumbled her way to her living. Reaching the couch bathed on the most sunlight she plopped face first along its length, sighing as the rays of the sun began to recharge her powers.</p>\n<p>Smiling as she felt her headache reside bit by bit, it took Kara a few moments to recognize not one but two extra heartbeats in her apartment, along with some barely restrained giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy, isn\u2019t she graceful this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! This is nothing. You should have seen her the last time she blew out her powers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFace planted three times. <em>That I know of.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Whipping up and around so hard she actually fell off the couch (causing even more snickers), Kara sat up to find a scene that made very little sense to her.</p>\n<p>Alex was sitting at the bar.</p>\n<p>With Lena.</p>\n<p>Drinking coffee and\u2026signing papers?</p>\n<p>With Lena Luthor?</p>\n<p>In her apartment?</p>\n<p>While she\u2019s hung over?</p>\n<p>Alex?</p>\n<p>Lena?</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-what?!\u201d Kara oh so clearly articulated, her hand waggling in the air as if to say \u2018please explain to me what exactly is happening in this situation as I am very baffled and perplexed\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Kara,\u201d Lena said, smiling warmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, sis,\u201d Alex added, marking something on a sheet of paper and pushing it towards Lena. \u201cInitial here, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026good-good morning. Lena. Alex. Wha\u2013when\u2013<em>why?</em>\u201d the blonde stammered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Lena offered absentmindedly, signing the paper.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did we get here?\u201d Alex continued.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why am I signing paperwork?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes!</em> To all that!\u201d Kara exclaimed, standing up and flapping her arms around, completely unsure of what position to place them in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell Kara,\u201d Alex said, signing one spot on the paper before marking another for Lena. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure that <em>someone</em> didn\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night and decide to go hunting for seashells.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-seashells?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm, and we got here late last night,\u201d Lena stated, \u201cAnd decided it would be easiest if we just stayed the night to watch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we did leave a bit ago to freshen up and for Alex to grab these papers. We just got back about, what, twenty minutes ago?\u201d Lena looked to Alex, who nodded confirmation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd as for why Lena is signing paperwork, well, that\u2019s kind of your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy fault?! What did I do\u2013did I <em>hurt someone</em>?! Lena I am <em>so</em> sorry! I swear I don\u2019t know what\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Lena laughed, walking over and taking a seat on the couch, pulling the blonde down with her.</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, Kara! You didn\u2019t hurt me, or anyone as far as we know,\u201d she reassured the blonde.</p>\n<p>Kara breathed a sigh of relief and plopped back into the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just signing these because you exposed yourself to me last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I DID WHAT?!</em>\u201d The Kryptonian jack-knifed so hard sitting up she nearly sent herself flying across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe means as Supergirl, Kara,\u201d Alex called from where she still sat in the kitchen sipping coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026<em>oh</em>. Oh <em>Rao</em>, Lena I am so sorry\u2026\u201d the blonde murmured sadly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry? What for?\u201d Lena asked; her brow furrowed in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2013I wanted to tell you, I swear on my House I did. But I just\u2026I couldn\u2019t find the right words\u2026\u201d she admitted sadly, her head hanging.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, it\u2019s fine,\u201d the CEO insisted. \u201cI understand, really I do. I\u2019m the sister of your cousin\u2019s worst\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why!\u201d Kara interjected, snapping her head up to look Lena in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI struggled with how to tell you because\u2013because\u2026\u201d the burst of fire died down and her head and shoulders slumped down once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know how to tell you that I am the cousin of the man who not only made your most beloved family member go insane, but also threw him in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKara\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m also the one who forced you into the position where you got your own mother arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was not your\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes it was!</em>\u201d Kara yelled, still not looking Lena in the eyes. \u201cMy family has done <em>nothing</em> but tear yours apart since we got on this planet. Because of my cousin you lost your best friend. And because of me\u2013,\u201d she leaned forward and cradled her head in her hands. \u201cBecause of me you are the last Luthor not incarcerated or dead. You\u2019re all alone now. Because of <em>me</em>. And I couldn\u2019t tell you this because I\u2019m a <em>coward</em> who didn\u2019t want to lose you and I-I\u2019m sorry, Lena. I\u2019m so, so sorry. Please forgive me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Arms wrapped around the blonde in a firm but gentle embrace and a soothing voice whispered in her ear as tears began streaming down Kara\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>Kara</em>\u2026shush now\u2026<em>none</em> of that was your fault. Do you hear me? None of it,\u201d Lena tightened her hold when the blonde began shaking her head, cutting off her objections. \u201cI mean it, Kara! No one is responsible for the actions of Lex and Lillian except <em>them! </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNot your cousin. Not you,\u201d she gulped, \u201cNot even me\u2026so don\u2019t\u2013don\u2019t ask for forgiveness. You\u2019ve done nothing that needs to be forgiven.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara sniffled and burrowed her head into Lena\u2019s shoulder, finally accepting her embrace. The pair were so focused on each other that both had forgotten they had an audience.</p>\n<p>Alex remained paused halfway between the kitchen and the couch. She\u2019d gotten up the second Kara had begun to cry, but Lena had beaten her to the punch. Feeling this was a moment the two needed to have, she stood by waiting and simply observed.</p>\n<p>The elder Danvers had been naturally wary of the youngest Luthor when she\u2019d first arrived in National City; but over time that suspicion had waned with each positive action the CEO had taken. Saving the lives of every alien in the city and arresting your insane mother along the way went a long way in Alex\u2019s book.</p>\n<p>Still she had been a bit concerned at the notion that Lena would discover Kara\u2019s secret. Even more so when she\u2019d called Alex last night to reveal that <em>she</em> had an incapacitated Kara alone in her office.</p>\n<p>The agent had tried her best to sound unaffected (if a bit exasperated) at the situation while on the phone, but internally she\u2019d been freaking out. Her sister might have trusted Lena (and had a bit of a crush on the CEO, which gave her a headache at the implications) but Alex barely knew the woman at all, and alien or not she was terrified of her sister being more or less at the mercy of a stranger.</p>\n<p>Then Lena had begun explaining how Kara came to be in her office in the first place; how the younger Danvers just <em>had</em> to fly across the city in the middle of the night,<em> drunk</em>, to tell Lena that she had pretty eyes.</p>\n<p>The absurdity of it (and the fact that Kara so would) alone was enough to get Alex to relax somewhat and begin to find humor in the situation.</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em> Lena had started rambling.</p>\n<p>Full on. Kara after six cases of doughnuts level. Rambling.</p>\n<p>About her <em>sister!</em> How she was like a <em>puppy</em>. How she was <em>adorable</em>. She called her a <em>cinnamon roll</em> and Alex reached her threshold.</p>\n<p>She broke down laughing.</p>\n<p>The stress of finding Kara gone, then learning she\u2019s drunk in the hands of a Luthor, then <em>said</em> Luthor all but gushing over how cute her sister was, compounded to make Alex just lose it.</p>\n<p>She actually had to pull off to the side of the road to avoid causing an accident. She laughed so hard Mon-El joined her from the back seat; though he had no clue what she was laughing about and soon fell asleep.</p>\n<p>Eventually Alex managed to pull herself together enough to hear Lena low-key cussing her out and telling her to \u201ccome get your sister Danvers she\u2019s started to make this kind of little snuffling snore in her sleep and is cuddling a pillow and it IS KILLING ME!!\u201d</p>\n<p>So the agent put her car in gear and soon found herself in Lena\u2019s office, awing at the sight of her little sister curled up on the couched, tucked into her cape with her normal clothes scattered on the floor.</p>\n<p>It took the both of them to wake her up and <em>wrangle</em> her down to the car. Alex debated taking it from there but between the worried looks Lena kept throwing at her sister (now sprawled on the back seat, practically laying on top of an oblivious Mon-El) and the daunting prospect of dealing with not one but <em>two</em> inebriated aliens had her asking Lena if she wanted to tag along before she could think too hard about it.</p>\n<p>Arriving at Kara\u2019s apartment the two found getting the blonde upstairs was even harder than down. Especially when she realized Lena was there and tried to serenade her. Which was fine, she had a lovely voice even when drunk; but she was singing in what sounded like Kryptonian. <em>Loudly.</em></p>\n<p>Finally dumping her onto her bed, and changing her into her sleepwear (which was a whole different kind of a challenge), Alex asked the CEO to wait while she dropped the Daxamite off at \u201chis place\u201d. She may trust Lena enough to leave her alone with her sister for a while, but the secret of the DEO would remain as such for a bit longer until the two could really talk.</p>\n<p>When she returned about an hour later, it was to the sight of Lena Luthor, CEO of one of the largest companies in world, curled up asleep on one end of her sister\u2019s couch looking almost like a little kitten.</p>\n<p>A glance at her watched made the agent wince as she realized it was coming up on 3 in the morning; no wonder the woman was so tired. Alex actually felt a little bad at the notion of waking the obviously exhausted woman up, but she didn\u2019t have a choice; Lena knew about Kara and so she and her <em>had</em> to have a talk.</p>\n<p>So with a heart that was slightly heavier than usual, the agent woke up the CEO\u2013who was adorably sleepy for all of two seconds before she really woke up and panicked slightly, not immediately recognizing her surroundings.</p>\n<p>Calming her down and reassuring her that everything was fine, Alex grabbed them both a drink from the kitchen and they set began talking about her knowing Kara\u2019s secret and the ramifications it entailed.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take long at all to convince the CEO into signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement, though she did insist she would read it all the way over before signing it.</p>\n<p>From there they just\u2026talked. About Kara and the predicament she\u2019d gotten herself in, the things she\u2019d said, things she\u2019d done to try to persuade Lena she and Supergirl weren\u2019t one and the same. Eventually, with either really noticing, the subject matter moved away from Kara until the pair found themselves gushing over recent medical and technological advancements till almost dawn.</p>\n<p>The two of them actually managed to fall asleep midsentence (Lena going first, followed shortly by Alex who was too tired to even notice) and woke up several hours later with sore necks. Checking in on Kara (who was still dead to the world eight hours after falling asleep the first time), the two decided to bow out for a while to freshen up. They agreed to return to Kara\u2019s at noon so Lena could sign the papers and to see how Kara faired hung over.</p>\n<p>Coming back into the moment just in time for the two girls to pull back from their hug Alex couldn\u2019t help but smile at the way they interacted with each other, how careful Lena was with literally the most indestructible person in National City.</p>\n<p>Wiping away a few errant tears, Kara asked, \u201cSo\u2026how exactly did I\u2026<em>\u2019expose\u2019</em> myself to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lena snickered while Alex piped up, \u201cDo you remember how Mon-El invited you out to get drinks last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara winced, \u201c\u2026Vaguely\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Her sister clapped her hands together like a teacher about to talk about her favorite subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell! <em>Apparently</em>, you two got to talking about various worlds you used to visit and you were struck with the epiphany that the twin moons of Zagara were a dead ringer for the eyes of a certain someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d the blonde paled as the night slowly crept back into her memory.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>then</em> you decided, in your great and drunken wisdom,\u201d Alex continued, \u201cThat you absolutely, positively, <em>had</em> to tell her right then and there!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>no</em>,\u201d Kara moaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>yes!</em>\u201d Alex crowed. \u201cAnd rather than drunk dial her\u2013like a normal person\u2013<em>you</em> decided to steal the bottle of alien ale you and <em>\u2018Monny\u2019</em> had been sharing, and flew\u2013yes <em>flew</em>\u2013all the way to L-Corp\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nooooo.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013Still dressed as one Kara Danvers!\u201d Alex finished with aplomb, taking a bow for her speech.</p>\n<p>The blonde stared at her sister, before slowly turned her mortified gaze to Lena and asking in a quiet squeak, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Biting her lip, Lena nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. You landed on my balcony with your shirt half undone and your cape sticking out the back. From there you began to basically wax poetic about me and how my eyes were like the moons of Zagara, my voice is like melodious singing brooks of Mandolia, and my skin is the color of the smooth marble-like seashells of Osheega.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeashells?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeashells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kara stared silently at Lena. Then she looked at Alex. Then back to Lena.</p>\n<p>After nearly a full minute of silence, Lena tentatively asked if she was alright?</p>\n<p>The Kryptonian's response was to get on her knees on the floor, lift up the couch (causing Lena to yelp suddenly), slide her body under it, and then drop said couch back down to the floor, hiding herself completely from view.</p>\n<p>The CEO got off the couch at the same time the agent walked over; both kneeling down to try to see Kara\u2019s face, which had wound up squished into the soft underside of the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara?\u201d Lena asked.</p>\n<p>She received a groan in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon sis, it\u2019s not <em>that</em> bad,\u201d Alex tried. \u201cI\u2019ve done way worse things when drunk!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026I\u2026I went on a date with Maxwell Lord!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were not drunk and it was for work. Doesn\u2019t count,\u201d the blonde grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Alex moaned, hoping she\u2019d forgotten the specifics.</p>\n<p>Lena joined in, \u201cKara it\u2019s fine, honest! I\u2019m very flattered! You were nothing but sweet last night.\u201d Under her breath she added, \u201cThe accidental strip-tease was a bit much, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\"THE WHAT?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOops,\u201d the pale woman mumbled, throwing an apologetic look Alex\u2019s way: she\u2019d forgotten about the super-hearing.</p>\n<p>Fed up, the agent exclaimed, \u201cKara, this is ridiculous, please come out from under the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Kara</em>\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI live here now, Alex!\u201d</p>\n<p>The elder Danvers thunked her head against the floor in exasperation.</p>\n<p>She <em>so</em> did not sign up for this shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cKara, you can not stay under the couch forever,\u201d Lena jumped in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI lasted 24 years in pod, I can handle this,\u201d the blonde grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d the CEO said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhat are you going to eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue Kara\u2019s stomach growled loudly enough for all three of them to hear it. What little of the blonde\u2019s face they could see turned bright red.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you come out if I got you potstickers?\u201d Lena offered.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026maybe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>And</em> a large pizza?\u201d Alex added.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026yeah...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll come out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Kara,\u201d Lena pleaded. \u201cFor me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later when they were all gathered around the bar, munching and talking like actual responsible adults; Alex just had to go and say one more thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Kara, most people decide come out of the <em>closet</em>; not from under the <em>couch</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Darn it, Alex!</em>\u201d</p>"
