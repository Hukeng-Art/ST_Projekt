  "summary": "<p>Lambert did his best not to get swept up in mortal politics. It didn't work. When he gets into trouble with a baron in Kerack, fighting his way out of the situation seems hopeless. Good thing Jaskier is nearby. Good thing he knows the baron in question. Good thing he wields power all his own in the world of the nobility. </p>\n<p>Oh, and did he mention his name is Julian? </p>\n<p>Set in the If I Starve timeline, but also works as a standalone. This one is pretty heavy on the friendship between Jaskier and Lambert, but I tagged it as Jaskier/Geralt because they are together in this 'verse.</p>",

Also yes. </p>\n<p>This piece will have a second part, likely posted in the next few days. And I will post the first part of a new piece (which will be much longer and angstier) a few days after that.

  "text": "<p>Witchers, as a general rule, do not involve themselves in the affairs of men. Which king marries who and how much grain each township is taxed are of little consequence to immortal monster hunters. Lambert, especially, avoids human politics. Kings are tiresome, queens are never as beautiful once you get to know them, and the exhaustion of dealing with human ignorance is more than he can bear, most nights. </p>\n<p> This time, though, he\u2019s going to have to make an exception. Because the Baron de Rothfurt\u2019s new wife is a faerie, and Lambert is pretty sure she\u2019s responsible for the deaths of twenty innocent men.</p>\n<p> He rode into Kerack a week ago and was immediately sought out by the local township to handle a monster problem. What plagued them, he did not know, but a mutilated body had been found by the edge of the forest every other night for over a month. The people were desperate. Despite some of the strongest anti-witcher sentiments this side of Novigrad, the local baron put out a contract with an impressive reward for anyone who could make the killings stop. </p>\n<p> Lambert let the stares slide off of him as he rode up to the baron\u2019s estate. It was a tasteless thing, covered in gold and poor imitations of great artists\u2019 works, with a lawn so large and elaborately decorated that the man must be compensating for something. Two servants in horrid orange and green uniforms ushered him into the main hall. </p>\n<p> The colors were so mismatched that Lambert focused in on his pendant and sent an image of his surroundings to Jaskier. A shocked gasp echoed in his ears a moment later, followed by a distinct feeling of disgust. </p>\n<p> <em>Orange and green?</em> Jaskier\u2019s voice said. <em>Who taught these fools to dress?</em> There was a pause, and then, <em>Wait, aren\u2019t those the Baron de Rothfurt\u2019s colors? Are you in Rothfurt?</em></p>\n<p> <em>You know him?</em></p>\n<p> <em>I</em> hate <em>that fucker. Spit in his ale for me, would you?</em></p>\n<p> Lambert chuckled aloud. He didn\u2019t feel bad for the look of terror that crossed the servants\u2019 faces. They could hate him all they wanted, but a healthy dose of fear mixed with their revulsion meant they should leave him be. </p>\n<p> <em>I\u2019ll try. What did he do to you?</em></p>\n<p> <em>Wait until you meet him. He\u2019s an easy man to hate.</em></p>\n<p> Five minutes later, the Baron received him in his office and Jaskier was proven right. </p>\n<p> Markus Holmberg, Baron de Rothfurt, was a pile of maggots shoved into human skin. He greeted Lambert from behind a massive desk, lounged back in the chair like a king, one hand resting on the wood, gemstone rings on each finger, the other hand running through his golden hair. A servant girl stood behind his left shoulder, trembling, and he squeezed her ass as she fled the room with hardly a glance in Lambert\u2019s direction. </p>\n<p> \u201cMutant,\u201d he said. </p>\n<p> <em>Bastard,</em> Lambert thought. What he said was, \u201cBaron. I hear you have work for me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLamentably. I would ban your filthy kind from my land entirely if I could, witcher.\u201d He eyed Lambert up and down, gaze lingering at the scars on his face and the hair he hadn\u2019t washed in a few days. \u201cDisgusting creatures, aren\u2019t you? No better than the beasts you hunt. But even beasts have their uses.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert ground his teeth together. He was no stranger to prejudice, particularly from nobility, who always seemed to think themselves more divine than human, but rare was the man who would declare it to his face. \u201cThe work?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cA mystery,\u201d answered the Baron. \u201cTwenty dead farmers and a decided drop in the taxes I am owed due to unworked fields.\u201d He clicked his fingers against the desktop, rings glinting in the light. \u201cFind it. Kill it. Bring me its head, I\u2019ll give you some silver, and I can have the joy of never seeing your brutish face on my property again. Does that suit, witcher?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert saw himself out. Fuming though he was, he didn\u2019t miss the beautiful woman he passed in the hallway, nor the way his wolf medallion hummed against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>His room is as far from the main hall as the Baron could offer. It has not been dusted in years. The sheets are ancient, smell of mold, and have a diamond pattern with the same combination of orange and green that was on the servants\u2019 uniforms- giving it the general appearance of day-old vomit.</p>\n<p> Lambert sleeps on the floor. </p>\n<p> Dawn filters through his windows a few hours later and he wakes, head tilted towards the door in expectation of a knock. It is the noble host\u2019s duty to provide breakfast for their guests- Jaskier was very clear on that point during his decorum lessons last winter- but when it becomes clear that no such knock is forthcoming, Lambert stumbles out of his bedroll and goes in search of food. </p>\n<p> He nearly trips over a bag of pig slop that has been left outside his room. The thing reeks of half rotten vegetables and chicken innards. He kicks it away with a sneer. To hell with spitting in the man\u2019s ale- Lambert is going to piss in it. </p>\n<p> The locals hate their baron nearly as much as the monster that hunts them. No one is willing to speak to him until he starts suggesting how nice it would be to relieve the baron of his coin. That earns him begrudging smiles from the farmers he visits and their stories start flowing forth. </p>\n<p> Figuring out that the baron\u2019s new wife is the source of the town\u2019s problem is laughably easy. Every man to speak of her does so with wistfulness in his tone. Some of the women, too, describe her ethereal looks and eternal kindness. Why she married such a bastard of a baron, no one can explain. They\u2019re all too busy being grateful for her smiles, and her shining hair, and the way she looks at them when she emerges from the halls of the manor. </p>\n<p> Lambert has never seen such an obvious enchantment. The baroness could probably hold a dagger to the throat of any one of the villagers and have them thank her for it. Their besotted descriptions, paired with the furious vibrations of his medallion when they meet for lunch, paint a clear picture. The baroness is a murderer. And from the glimpse of her gossamer wings that he catches in a silver mirror while tailing her through the manor, she\u2019s also a faerie. </p>\n<p> It leaves him in a tricky spot. Killing her would be simple. Near as he can tell, she isn\u2019t a fighter. The enchantment on the town ensures that her prey is willing and unafraid. She has no need to practice defensive magic when everyone she comes across bows beneath her power, so Lambert is certain that one good swipe with his silver sword would take her head clean off and end the villagers\u2019 terror. The only problem is, when? </p>\n<p> He\u2019s not foolish enough to expect a reward from the baron for killing his wife. The second she dies, faerie or no, she will be painted as the victim and Lambert as the brutal killer. But be that as it may, he cannot leave the townspeople to die. It will have to be handled quietly. Pack his bags, slay the faerie, and leave town before the baron is any wiser. </p>\n<p> Nothing goes according to plan. </p>\n<p> Lambert tracks the baroness as she leaves the manor and heads into town. She turns down a series of side alleys and he follows on silent feet, sword already drawn. When she freezes at a dead end, he comes to a halt. </p>\n<p> \u201cAre you there, witcher?\u201d she calls. </p>\n<p> There is no point in hiding. Lambert steps out from the shadows and lets his blade flash in the moonlight. \u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThen I suppose my time is up.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert cocks his head and meets her eyes. They gleam with magic in the dark of the alleyway. \u201cDid you kill those people?\u201d</p>\n<p> The baroness grins. \u201cI did. Drained them of their lives and left their bodies for my people in the forest. Neat handiwork, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIt is a clever complacency spell.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI know.\u201d She sighs. \u201cPity it doesn\u2019t work on you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cPity,\u201d Lambert agrees. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s odd, he thinks, that she isn\u2019t putting up more of a fight. Faeries are notorious for their tricks and riddles, their schemes to lure in mortals and ruin them with magic. Even without true fighting skill, he expected her to try to make a deal, or simply to run when she learned he was onto her. </p>\n<p> The baroness lets down her hair. It falls in chestnut brown curls down her shoulders, becoming disheveled as she runs her hands through it. She slides one side of her dress down and Lambert wonders idly if she\u2019s trying to seduce him. She\u2019s not doing a very good job of it. </p>\n<p> \u201cCome on then, witcher. Kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p> It\u2019s so obviously a trap that Lambert has to do a double take. But he can sense that there is no magic in the area. No strange talismans around her bare neck, nothing unusual about the alley, and no other faeries in town, as far as he could tell from his day spent amongst the villagers. If this is a trap, Lambert cannot see it, and he cannot defend against it. Instincts honed by years of experience scream at him to act. He raises his sword and lunges. </p>\n<p> The instant his foot leaves the ground, the world shifts. Moonlight is replaced by torchlight, uneven cobblestones by gleaming wood. The baroness cowers, eyes dull like a mortal\u2019s, and screams. </p>\n<p> \u201cNo!\u201d she cries, but it\u2019s too late. Momentum carries Lambert\u2019s sword forward and her head tumbles from her shoulders with a sickening thud. </p>\n<p> Silence in the hall. </p>\n<p> Gone is the dark alleyway. Lambert raises his eyes from the faerie\u2019s body to take in the scene before him. There is a minstrel a few feet away with a slack jaw. At the main table, nobles and their servants are frozen with their hands in the air, shock written plainly across their faces, meals forgotten before them. Markus Holmberg himself lords over the scene, a gaudy coronet weighing heavy on his brow, eyes storming with revulsion that turns quickly to rage. Ever so slowly, Lambert gets to his feet. </p>\n<p> He knows from explorations earlier in the day that there are ten guards in the hall. Probably more, given that the baron is hosting noble guests, and there are scores of servants, entertainers, and bystanders that will get in the way of fighting himself free. The silver sword is in his hand, slick with the baroness\u2019 blood. His mind screams at him to run, even though he won\u2019t get far. Run, run, run, and pray the gods have mercy. </p>\n<p> But the gods abandoned Lambert long ago. </p>\n<p> The soldiers attack with all the rage of scorned lovers- men whose enchantment addled minds have space for nothing save lust and hatred. Lambert's mutated body is fast, but not faster than ten guards. They catch up to him before he makes it halfway to the nearest door. He knocks the sword out of one of the men\u2019s hands and puts it through his chest, whirling as another sword sails over his head and collides with the soldier behind him. The move takes his balance away for a few precious seconds. A spear collides with Lambert\u2019s right knee and he falls, catching another blow with his sword as he goes. </p>\n<p> \u201cStop,\u201d shouts the baron. The men drop their weapons and Lambert tries to stand again. A heavy metal boot falls on his back, pushing him into the floor. His sword is kicked out of his hand with a clang. </p>\n<p> \u201cSire,\u201d one of the men begins. He falls silent at a gesture from the baron that Lambert can\u2019t quite see. Silk shoes whisper over the polished floor as Markus approaches his fallen bride. </p>\n<p> \u201cMy wife,\u201d he says. It is spoken with the tone of a child who has lost their favorite plaything. \u201cMy wife,\u201d he repeats, a theatric boom in his voice, \u201cmy beautiful bride, slain! By this beast!\u201d Lambert cannot see the baron, but is certain that a bejeweled finger is being pointed in his direction. \u201cThrow him in the dungeons.\u201d</p>\n<p> <em>Fuck,</em> Lambert thinks. Three soldiers lift him by the arms as a fourth presses a spear against the small of his back. He stumbles forward at their insistence, eyes scanning the room for a way to escape but finding nothing. </p>\n<p> <em>What happened?</em> </p>\n<p> It\u2019s Geralt\u2019s voice, gruff yet open in the way he is after he has just woken. He must be halfway across the continent for him to be waking at this hour. Far away- and of little use even if he were with Lambert. There are too many men too fight, too many innocents for an all-out slaughter. </p>\n<p> Lambert sends images through the pendants. The baroness, baring her neck in the alleyway. The shift. Her head, rolling on the floor, and her husband\u2019s face when he realized it was a witcher who put it there. </p>\n<p> He can feel Geralt thinking as the guards march him down hall after hall, their boots ringing on the stone. They throw him in a cell none too gently and two men hold him down while another searches him for weapons. Lambert sends an image of that, too.</p>\n<p> <em>Escape routes?</em></p>\n<p> The room is dark, lit only by the torches held by the guards in the hall outside. No windows. One door. Metal bars thick and rust-free, barring him from making a run for it. </p>\n<p> <em>Not many.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Resources?</em></p>\n<p> Lambert looks around. His cell is sparse, with little more to speak of than a few pebbles on the floor. The guards stripped him of his potions, knives, and anything else they deemed a threat. In a rare burst of wisdom, these lackeys seemed to realize that anything can be deadly in a witcher\u2019s hands, and have divested him of everything save his tunic, trousers, and a few pieces of leather armor. </p>\n<p> <em>Not many,</em> he repeats. </p>\n<p> A new voice comes down the line. <em>Oh, Lambert, dear. What have you gotten yourself into?</em> </p>\n<p> <em>Nothing pleasant, Jaskier. This baron of yours is a real piece of work.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s offended scoff comes down the line clear as day. <em>He\u2019s not</em> my <em>fucking anything. He\u2019s a bastard and a scoundrel, and honestly, I\u2019m not shocked the man had you thrown in prison a few days after meeting you. Markus always did have a pathetic little power complex.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert thinks on his first impression of the man and finds himself agreeing. <em>I think he\u2019s compensating for something.</em></p>\n<p> A delighted laugh rings in his ears. <em>I\u2019ve seen his cock, it\u2019s tiny.</em></p>\n<p> <em>You\u2019ve seen his-</em></p>\n<p> <em>Lambert,</em> Geralt interrupts. <em>Have they hurt you?</em></p>\n<p> Given the fact that he killed their baroness and three soldiers in the span of a few minutes, Lambert is grateful that the bruises in his side aren\u2019t worse. <em>No.</em></p>\n<p> <em>Are they going to?</em> Jaskier asks. The mirth in his tone has fled. </p>\n<p> <em>Probably. I killed their faerie baroness. Most of the town was under her enchantment.</em></p>\n<p> The light in the hallway fades as the guards leave for the night. Before the last of them slips out, he spins on his heel and spits directly in Lambert\u2019s face. </p>\n<p> \u201cFuckin\u2019 mutant.\u201d</p>\n<p> <em>I can be there in a week,</em> Geralt says. </p>\n<p> <em>We can\u2019t fight our way out of this one, Geralt. It isn\u2019t Nilfgaard. The baron is not without protection.</em></p>\n<p> He cannot see his brother\u2019s face, but Lambert would bet anything that Geralt\u2019s brows are drawn in frustration. They cannot win this fight. Any attempt to break Lambert out with force would be a suicide mission. </p>\n<p> <em>We can try.</em></p>\n<p> <em>No, no. No need for that.</em> Jaskier cuts in, forced joviality in his voice. He always sounds strained like this after they mention Nilfgaard, though the pain isn\u2019t as bad as it once was. Lambert gets the urge to slaughter someone every time he hears it. <em>As it so happens, I am in the area. I parted ways with Eskel a few days ago you know, and I made my way to Kerack. I can be at the piss-poor fields of Rothfurt by dawn.</em></p>\n<p> <em>And what are</em> you <em>going to do about it?</em> Lambert can\u2019t keep the incredulity out of his tone. <em>Write a nasty song about him?</em></p>\n<p> <em>I have written several nasty songs about him, actually. But that is beside the point. I\u2019m going to use something you witchers don\u2019t seem acquainted with, darling. A tool that has not yet entered your arsenal.</em> Jaskier pauses, no doubt so a teasing grin can spread across his face. <em>Diplomacy.</em></p>\n<p>The closet doors are thrown open by a steady hand. His carriage stands ready outside, his most trusted driver at the reins. He did not rush through dinner. He will not rush through this. </p>\n<p> Servants help him dress. They are silent as they divest him of his doublet and replace it with far finer threads, stripping the signs of the road from his body. The weight of the night is heavy on their shoulders and their hands are gentle on his skin, dancing carefully over fresh scars, their wariness and curiosity swallowed back in the face of their lord. He is rarely home. Celebrations are held when he is, of course; the people love him. But he has never looked like this- rugged and silken, broken and brutal, every inch the regal man they know him to be. </p>\n<p> His voice sings songs of the White Wolf. Their voices whisper praises of him. Their lord, their traveller, who dares to stand by the side of legends and manages to emerge unscathed. They mutter about his face, which never seems to age. They gossip about his scars, wondering if perhaps, just perhaps, the stories are true. Minstrels come through Lettenhove telling tales of sorceresses and dragons, of princesses and destiny. The bold among them lower their voices and speak of slaughter. Of a war camp burnt to the ground. Of piles of corpses and broken swords and screams, and at the center of it all, a bard. </p>\n<p> None of them know why he is dressing in the middle of the night, but all are certain that there is adventure afoot. He rides to someone\u2019s aid. He rides to destiny. They help him into velvet and ancient jewels, quiet as their awed whispers of his name, and smile to themselves with the knowledge that this time, they were part of destiny too.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>It is morning when a guard comes to open Lambert\u2019s cell. There are no windows in his prison, but he has been awake the entire night, deep in meditation. The boy who enters his cell is slight. He trembles as he sets a tray of food by the door. Lambert can\u2019t help himself- he leans forward from his place on the floor and snarls at the boy, showing his teeth like the beast they think he is.</p>\n<p> The young soldier squeals and scrambles back. He bolts down the hallway, torch forgotten behind him, and shouts for his companions. Lambert curses as he runs. Vesemir always warned him about his impulse control- about not digging himself into a deeper hole. Pity he didn\u2019t heed that advice. </p>\n<p> Four men come down the hallway, the boy at their heels. </p>\n<p> \u201cI see the monster is awake,\u201d says the first one. </p>\n<p> \u201cI never slept,\u201d Lambert spits back. \u201cUnlike you, I have no need for it.\u201d</p>\n<p> That\u2019s not entirely true, but Lambert enjoys the shock in brings to the man\u2019s face. Those who fear witchers are willing to believe anything about them. Any monstrous detail, and difference between witchers and themselves, telling stories of how inhuman witchers are, how unnatural. Most witchers try to ignore the myths. Lambert appreciates their usefulness. </p>\n<p> \u201cBeast,\u201d the soldier says. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhore\u2019s son.\u201d</p>\n<p> The soldier lets out a shout of rage and throws the cell door open. Lambert has no plans to escape. He just wants the fight, wants to enjoy the crunch of his fist on bone as he throws the man into the wall with a single blow. They beat him afterwards, of course. His skin is torn and his ribs bruised, but Lambert doesn\u2019t care. He spits blood into the face of the nearest guard and grins.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Julian steps from his carriage door onto the gravel drive. The weight on his back is not from a lute as usual, but from a velvet cloak that sweeps against the ground as he walks. It is familiar all the same. Two servants flank him, their heads held high as he strides to the front doors of the manor. He lifts the knocker and lets it fall, just once, before settling back to wait. A disgruntled butler opens the door.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe Baron is not expecting guests,\u201d he says. It is not a proper greeting. Julian\u2019s lips press into a thin line.</p>\n<p> \u201cI do not need to be expected. Markus is at breakfast, I assume?\u201d</p>\n<p> The butler takes in his appearance for the first time. His eyes linger on the signet ring around Julian\u2019s finger and he swallows hard. \u201cYes, my Lord. He sat down not three minutes past.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood. See me to him.\u201d</p>\n<p> Markus\u2019 estate is as atrocious as Julian remembered. He eyes the artwork with distaste and decides to give the housekeeper at Lettenhove a raise. In front of a pair of double doors, the butler hesitates. Julian raises an eyebrow at him and he lowers his eyes, raising a hand to knock. </p>\n<p> \u201cEnter,\u201d booms Markus\u2019 voice. </p>\n<p> His butler swings open the doors and bows low. \u201cA visitor, sire.\u201d</p>\n<p> Markus cannot see him in the darkness of the hallway, hidden as he is behind the half open doors and the butler. Good. Julian always did enjoy making an entrance. </p>\n<p> \u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p> Another bow, and then the butler raises his voice in the proper tone for announcing a noble guest. \u201cJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove.\u201d</p>\n<p> He needs no further introduction. Julian sweeps past the man into the main hall. Markus is at the head of the table, surrounded by minor lords and their servants. He meets Julian\u2019s eyes with the most delicious look of surprise. </p>\n<p> \u201cJulian,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLord Pankratz,\u201d Julian corrects. \u201cDo remember your manners, Markus.\u201d</p>\n<p> The baron\u2019s face flames beet red and he drops his fork with a clatter. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI have come for my witcher.\u201d</p>\n<p> Markus\u2019 guests break into a storm of excited chatter. The baron digs his fingers into the table until his knuckles turn white. \u201cYou dare claim that beast as your own? He killed my wife!\u201d </p>\n<p> A small white lie is called for here. Julian is uncertain how the baron would react to the news that he has shared a bed with Lambert, albeit platonically. \u201cIndeed. He is in my service, and I will not stand to have him mistreated.\u201d</p>\n<p> The baron lashes out in anger, sweeping his water goblet from the table. \u201cMistreated? That mutant is a monster.\u201d</p>\n<p> Julian hums dismissively. \u201cI heard the true monster was your wife. She had the whole town bewitched and you were too busy getting your dick wet to notice.\u201d</p>\n<p> Slack jawed, the baron casts about for an excuse. Finding none, he narrows his eyes at Julian and changes tactics. \u201cHow could you possibly know that? She was killed just last night. Are you a sorcerer as well as a monster lover now, too?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNothing happens in Kerack without my knowledge.\u201d Julian gestures widely, encompassing the room and everything beyond it. \u201cEvery whisper, every death. My network is wide and varied, Holmberg, unlike yours. Word of your faerie bride\u2019s untimely demise reached my ears scant hours after the fact.\u201d The baron\u2019s face pales, and Julian continues, \u201cI know there is naught but shit between your ears, so I\u2019ll use small words.\u201d He leans in closer and speaks slowly, as if to a child. \u201cYou have my witcher. Release him.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe\u2019s a murderer!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd you\u2019re a cunt.\u201d Julian levels him with a haughty glare. \u201cMust we stand here stating the obvious? Release him, Markus. I\u2019ll not ask again.\u201d</p>\n<p> The baron pushes himself to his feet, sputtering. \u201cYou cannot make me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI can.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWith what?\u201d Markus points a finger at Julian\u2019s chest. His guards tighten their grip on their weapons. Perhaps it would have threatened a lesser man. \u201cAre you here to blackmail me, <em>Lord Pankratz?</em> To spit on my name with another of your ridiculous ditties? The witcher is a killer and a criminal, and I shall do with him as I see fit.\u201d</p>\n<p> Julian does not flinch. He hardly moves as Markus spits and shouts, standing firm before the table and giving off the distinct impression that it is <em>his</em> hall rather than the baron\u2019s. </p>\n<p> \u201cBlackmail you?\u201d he asks lightly. \u201cI could. I could tell these lovely guests of yours all about the bastard children, and the affairs, and how it is you came to be married to a faerie woman in the first place.\u201d Julian offers the diners a smirk. \u201cOr perhaps I should mention the gambling, or the empty lines on your ledgers.\u201d</p>\n<p> He tilts his head as if in thought, and continues, \u201cI could threaten you. With as few knights as you have these days, I don\u2019t imagine Rothfurt is up for protecting against an attack, even from a mortal army. And, well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the stories.\u201d</p>\n<p> A shudder works its way down Markus\u2019 spine. Every man in Kerack has heard the stories. Supernatural hunters, with alchemical fire and blades sharp enough to cut a man through sight alone. He notes the quiet confidence in Julian\u2019s posture and realizes, with a bolt of shock, exactly who he has imprisoned in his dungeon. A witcher with a wolf medallion. The spectre that haunts the dreams of Nilfgaardians. Fear like cold steel wraps around his throat. </p>\n<p> \u201cBut here\u2019s the beautiful thing,\u201d Julian says. \u201cI don\u2019t <em>need</em> to.\u201d He smiles at Markus like a predator, eyes flashing with something not entirely human. \u201cI don\u2019t need to blackmail you, or threaten you, or remind you of my favor with the king. I don\u2019t need to do anything, Markus, because <em>I outrank you.</em> My boots are yours to polish. My orders are yours to obey.\u201d His voice rings clear as a bell in the stillness of the hall. \u201cMake no mistake, Baron de Rothfurt- this is a direct order. Bring me my witcher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>There are no insults this time. No leers, no bruises. The soldiers open Lambert\u2019s cell door with their eyes firmly planted on the floor, their skin reeking of barely suppressed fear. Two of them haul him to his feet and march him out of the dungeon. Lambert goes willingly.</p>\n<p> He recognizes the halls they dragged him through yesterday. His body aches from the morning\u2019s beatings, but he is lucid enough to retrace their steps. The smell of fear grows stronger as they approach the main hall, until it\u2019s so thick in the air that Lambert can hardly stand it. He is unsure why their fear increases, when he is already subdued. </p>\n<p> A servant pushes open the doors and he is thrown unceremoniously to the ground, the soldiers behind him making a hasty retreat. </p>\n<p> \u201cAre you satisfied now, my lord?\u201d the baron asks. </p>\n<p> \u201cNot quite.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s head snaps up at the voice. A familiar man stands in front of him, displeasure written into every line on his face. But this man is not the one he knows. </p>\n<p> He always thought the bard\u2019s travelling silks were ridiculous. Now Lambert understands why he called them \u201ccasual.\u201d Julian\u2019s outfit is a thousand times more decadent than anything he brings on the Path. Rich blue velvet makes up his overcoat, the sleeves embroidered in gold thread to match the heavy gold belt at his waist. His breeches and shoes are similarly adorned. Gemstones glint in place of buttons. </p>\n<p> The coronet on his head looks like it belongs there. Lambert can see it in the set of Julian\u2019s spine, can hear it in the echoes of his voice from lessons past, teaching about the differences between crowns, coronets, and tiaras. Status drips from his pores. It races through his veins like blood. His syllables come out clipped, in a perfect, studied lilt that is built from issuing orders and knowing they will be obeyed. </p>\n<p> \u201cStand up, Lambert.\u201d</p>\n<p> He hauls his feet beneath his aching body and stands. Julian does not reach out a hand to help him. Instead, he turns to the baron. </p>\n<p> \u201cThis man saved your town. What say you to him?\u201d</p>\n<p> Markus\u2019 eyes are filled with liquid hate, and no small amount of fear, as he looks at Lambert. \u201cThank you,\u201d he grits out. </p>\n<p> \u201cNo.\u201d Julian clicks his tongue. \u201cOn your knees, Markus.\u201d</p>\n<p> Every soul in the hall holds their breath. Julian looks on, unaffected. The baron meets his eyes and defiance burns bright in his gaze. </p>\n<p> With a voice like the whisper of an arrow being released from a bowstring, Julian says, \u201cI will not repeat myself.\u201d</p>\n<p> The baron\u2019s jaw clenches. It unclenches. He pushes his seat away from the table, ignoring the scrape of metal on wood flooring. He moves to stand in front of Jaskier. He sinks to his knees. </p>\n<p> \u201cThank you, Lord Pankratz.\u201d </p>\n<p> Julian shakes his head. \u201cNot me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d says the baron, with his eyes lowered in shame and his breeches dirty from the floor, \u201cwitcher.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cAnd?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI am sorry for your wrongful imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p> The words are said between gritted teeth, but they are said all the same. Lambert feels a little as though the air has been knocked from his chest. Insincere though it may be, he has never received an apology for mistreatment before. Not even at sword point. </p>\n<p> A smug smile breaks across Julian\u2019s face. \u201cBetter.\u201d He leans down to grab the baron\u2019s chin, tilting his face up so he is forced to meet Julian\u2019s icy glare. \u201cBe careful from now on, Markus. Remember, I hear everything. Every. Little. Slip.\u201d His fingers grip hard enough to turn the baron\u2019s skin red beneath them. \u201cI won\u2019t always be in such a generous mood.\u201d</p>\n<p> With that, he shoves Markus away and pivots on his heel. Two servants emerge from the shadows to fall in step behind him. They shoot self-satisfied looks to the baron\u2019s men, still garbed in their horrid livery. The baron is still on the floor, shivering. </p>\n<p> \u201cCome along, Lambert.\u201d </p>\n<p> His injured knee causes a bit of a limp as Lambert follows him to the front door. They burst out into sunlight and Jaskier immediately throws the velvet cloak from his shoulders, sighing loudly as it hits the ground. </p>\n<p> \u201c<em>Shit,</em>\u201d he says with feeling. </p>\n<p> Lambert is manhandled into the waiting carriage, and immediately familiar fingers slip under his shirt to check for injuries. When he brushes over a few minor cuts, Jaskier\u2019s face darkens. </p>\n<p> \u201cI am going to <em>ruin</em> him.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d Lambert says, but he lets Jaskier pull off his shirt anyway. A first aid kit emerges from somewhere as the carriage starts rolling. Jaskier rubs an ointment along a vicious purple bruise and Lambert relaxes back into it, feeling the strain of fighting and imprisonment finally catch up to him. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, no,\u201d Jaskier says firmly, \u201cI have plans. I am going to drag that man\u2019s reputation through so much mud even swine will shudder to look at him.\u201d</p>\n<p> It\u2019s no idle threat. Lambert is certain that the Baron de Rothfurt may soon find himself divested of a title. He\u2019d be lying if he said the thought didn\u2019t please him.</p>\n<p> Lambert shoots a wry grin up at Jaskier, letting his teeth show and reveling in the lack of fear produced by them. \u201cYou said you\u2019d seen his cock?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier groans and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment. \u201cIt was an ill-advised tryst in my teenage years.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019ve <em>slept</em> with that shit stain?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019ve slept with half the Continent,\u201d Jaskier shoots back. \u201cAnd a good chunk of the nobility, too. Don\u2019t look so surprised about it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Laughing makes his ribs ache, but Lambert does it anyway. \u201cHalf the Continent, and you settle down with Geralt? You\u2019re selling yourself short, <em>Lord Pankratz.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d Jaskier cuffs him over the back of the head. It\u2019s childish, and silly, and exactly the kind of casual touch that every other mortal on the face of the earth is too afraid to engage in with a witcher. A grin spreads between Lambert\u2019s ears as he cuffs him right back.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Their lord brings back a witcher. He has glowing gold eyes and two terrifying slashes down one side of his face, but the lord touches him like something precious. They joke and tease as they walk into the manor, the witcher leaning on the lord for support.</p>\n<p> The two men retire to a sitting room, the servants gathering round outside the door to eavesdrop. One serving girl grows bold enough to peek in the keyhole. Her eye catches on the glint of a wolf medallion, and she turns excitedly to tell the others. </p>\n<p> <em>Yes,</em> she says, <em>it\u2019s one of them.</em></p>\n<p> One of <em>them.</em> The four. The great. </p>\n<p> Nilfgaard\u2019s Bane, one man calls them. The Wolves of Wrath, says another. Indeed, a great debate has waged for months in Lettenhove on what to call the four men who laid siege to Nilfgaard\u2019s army and saved the viscount\u2019s life, but one thing can be agreed upon by all; they are heroes.</p>\n<p> The butler brings wine and refreshments before the lord can think to ask, bowing as deeply to the witcher as he does the viscount. Servants rush to clear out a room, changing the sheets twice in their excitement and running feather dusters down every inch of exposed surface, running back and forth to take turns at the keyhole.</p>\n<p> When he has eaten his fill, the witcher is ushered up the stairs by a rather disgruntled looking viscount. \u201cTrust you to start a fight instead of sleeping like a <em>sane</em> prisoner,\u201d he mutters, and they disappear up the stairs. </p>\n<p> The witcher sleeps for a long time. His fire is stoked with diligence. His hallway is kept clear of noises, distractions, and overwhelming smells. A bath is drawn for him with water near to boiling. Curious eyes watch through yet another keyhole as their lord bathes him, running fingers through the witcher\u2019s hair and chastising him gently for the blood that has accumulated there. It feels too private, and soon they look away.</p>\n<p> Later, hours later, when the witcher has eaten, and made conversation, and fallen asleep once more, the lord makes his way down to the kitchens. He has changed back into more common clothes, but the regality remains. The butler and the cook and the wait staff gather at his summons. </p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. He meets each of their eyes and holds them there, pride glowing bright in his expression. A matching pride roars to life within them. \u201cThank you for welcoming him.\u201d</p>\n<p> One by one, they bow. One by one, they return to their duties. Determination is set in their expressions. Come morning, the witcher will have breakfast at his bedside and a freshly polished set of swords in the corner of his room. It is the least they can do for a man who has saved so many lives. The world may not be ready to thank him yet, but there is a home for him in Lettenhove.</p>\n<p> Yes, the servants have heard the stories. They listened well.</p>"
