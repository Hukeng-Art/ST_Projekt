The young star that made his debut at the age of seventeen where he secured a role in one of <em><u>Lan Qiren\u2019s </u></em><u>most famous series</u> and his fame has never looked back since<em>. </em>Despite being absent from the entertainment industry for two whole years, the young and talented actor made his full comeback and starred in this year\u2019s mega-hit drama <u>\u201cLove, destiny.\u201d</u> Fans can\u2019t get enough of Wei Wuxian and his captivating smile and honestly neither can we!</p>\n<p>\n<sub>\u00a0</sub>\n</p>\n<p>[image: Wei Wuxian looking at the camera with a wide smile]</p>\n<p>We thought it will be fun to share some facts about this wonderful person with you all!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.Wei Wuxian is an orphan</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Wei Wuxian\u2019s parents died when he was only two years old and he also lived in an orphanage for a year! He was adopted by Jiang Fengmian at the tender age of three and thus begins the wholesome relationship between the three siblings; Jiang Yanli, Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian!</p>\n<p>[image: A smiling, young Jiang Yanli holding two little boys in her arms. Wei Wuxian is looking at the camera with a broad smile while Jiang Cheng looks at his sister meekly with a blush on his face]</p>\n<p>If you have not been living under a wrong, you\u2019ll definitely know what we are talking about! Those two brother are overly protective of their older sister and Jiang Yanli herself is ready to have a talk with anyone who lash out on her brothers. Honestly this special bond these three share is something really precious and fans can never get enough of their interactions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2. Wuxian is called wifi</strong>\n</p>\n<p>His name <em>Wuxian </em>means \u201cno envy\u201d, but Wei Wuxian is lovingly called Wifi by his fans, due to the homonym between the Chinese word for Wi-Fi and his name Wuxian.</p>\n<p>[image: Wei Wuxian with his hair in a messy bun wearing a t-shirt with a wifi symbol on it. Jiang Cheng can be seen wearing the same t-shirt sitting behind but he has a look of utter disgust on his face]</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Wei Wuxian is not single</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yes. So any new fangirls planning to make on a move on him, you all are already too late. Wei Wuixan has been dating his highschool crush who is none other than <em>Lan Wangji, </em>the famous singer for three years now. The couple are called \u201cWangxian\u201d by their fans and shippers and they also have been seen using the ship name many times \u00a0They are living embodiment of Childhood Friend to Lovers.</p>\n<p>[GIF: Wei Wuxian greeting Lan Wangj with a kiss on the cheek and lips. This was taken when Lan Wangji made a visit on the set of \u201cLove, Destiny\u201d to surprise Wei Wuxian]</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4. He suffers from a severe case of cynophobia</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cynophobia is the fear of dogs and our wifi has never missed a chance to express his loathing and fear of them. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Remember the time when Wei Wuxian had to shoot with a dog on set and he almost had a full blown panic attack? The directors had to cut that scene out from the script and Wei Wuxian had later apologized profusely for the inconvenience.</p>\n<p>[GIF: Wei Wuxian looking straight into the camera and declaring his hate for dogs. The subtitles read: \u201cThose awful beasts shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d]</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.He is also a really good artist and singer.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is multi-talented, there is no doubt about this fact. Before enrolling himself in an acting school, he was actually pursuing to become a graphic designer! If you follow him on his various social media accounts you\u2019ll find him posting his various doodles and sketches. His recent ones mostly include of his boyfriend Lan Wangji and rabbits.</p>\n<p>Do you remember the famous duet by Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian that broke the internet <em>and </em>the fans? It was in a live stream and a fan requested him to sing a song with Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, bless this man, forced Lan Wangji to sing the song which in his words <em>\u201cYou\u00a0 had written for me, Lan Zhan.\u201d </em>\u00a0Unfortunately we never got to here this song dubbed as \u201cWangxian duet\u201d by the fans again but Wei Wuxian\u2019s singing voice clearly enraptured us all.</p>\n<p>[GIF: Lan Wangji and Wei Wuixan sitting in front of the camera in a live stream. Wei Wuxian cheerfully suggests something to the other. The subtitles read: <em>Let\u2019s sing the song you wrote for me!\u201d</em>]</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MORE LIKE THIS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> <u>10 latest upcoming dramas you surely wouldn\u2019t want to miss</u> </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> <u>Lan Wangji to release a surprise new single soon!

GUYS!!!! I think I have a new theory??? Maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji dropped his new single <em>today </em>out of all days and it was totally unexpected too. So it got me thinking and I wondered why did he release it today (cause my brain loves to spent hours contemplating shitdon\u2019t call me out) and I think I have come up with a solid theory.</p>\n<p>I know whatever I type here remains only a whimsical fantasy of mine but hear me out okay</p>\n<p>*takes a deep breath*</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji fell in love with Wei Wuxian today on 12th of September. (or realized that he was in love)</p>\n<p>I know you all are going to call me crazy but I come here with evidence and proofs.</p>\n<p>First Nie Huiasang\u2019s tweet <u>here</u>. which gave me the first hint. Lan Wangji clearly looks smitten in this picture. Now a important thing to remember here is the date. 12.09.2009</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second let us see this tweet <u>here</u> from Lan Wangji\u2019s producer which clearly states that \u201csempiternal\u201d had an early release and Lan Wangji especially insisted it to be today. Why? Read my theory above. Now *rolls up sleeves* lets examine the lyrics to this beautiful song as well.</p>\n<p>The very first line</p>\n<p>\n<em>A story that took place before autumn </em>\n</p>\n<p>(I did my research guys. So in 2009 autumn started on 23 September. And the lyrics say that the story takes place before autumn. ARE YALL GETTING MY POINT? 12 SEPTEMBER!!)</p>\n<p>\n<em>You looked at me that day,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And suddenly I realize</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I can never look away again</em>\n</p>\n<p>(THIS)</p>\n<p>\n<em>Days pass away </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>But my heart hasn\u2019t rested since</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLove\u201d it sang</em>\n</p>\n<p>(okay. So days pass away right? But how many? We don\u2019t know. But but but the next lyrics)</p>\n<p>\n<em>A day before the festival </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I prepared words to say it all</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0you smiled and gazed at me</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And I could remember them no longer.</em>\n</p>\n<p>(a day before the festival. One might think which festival. WELL GUESS WHAT mid-autumn festival was celebrated on 3 oct 2009. Conincidence? I think not)</p>\n<p>Now coming back to the first line.</p>\n<p>\u201ca story that took place before autumn\u201d that means before 23 sep. which means lwj could have fallen in love with wwx before that.</p>\n<p>This interview <u>here</u> with wwx where he clearly states and I quote \u201cLan Zhan says that he had fallen for me by the time we were 15. Guess how old they were in 2009?</p>\n<p>And <u>here </u>and <u>here</u> is a tweet from Jiang Yanli with her brothers <em>and </em>lwj on mid-autumn festival labeled \u201c2009\u201d and she said this picture gives \u201cSempiternal\u201d vibes.</p>\n<p>Knowing how cryptic nhs is I wouldn\u2019t go pass by his tweet. Combining his tweet, lwj insistence to release the song today (12), Jiang Yanli\u2019s tweet and the song lyrics</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, gals and pals, I have come to the conclusion that lwj fell head over heels for wwx on 12 Sep 2009.</p>\n<p>Also</p>\n<p>The last line of the song</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>A story that took place that day</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>The day I realized I was in love</em>\n</p>\n<p>I MEAN CAN IT BE ANYMORE OBVIOUS</p>\n<p>\n<strong>realdeal</strong>\n</p>\n<p>OP I luv you for this post.

There are some that make us laugh while others simply make us swoon with their public displays of affection, both on and off screen. We are proud to say that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji fall in both of the above categories! Wangxian is the internet\u2019s power couple; there is no denying this fact. And the history they share together is nothing short of legendry.</p>\n<p>Wangxian is every every fanfic trope there is under the sun and listed below are reasons why!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We all know that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji have known each other since childhood. They went to the same school together, studied in the same high school <em>and </em>enrolled themselves in the same college. One would say that they quickly became friends but wasn\u2019t the case! Infact Wei Wuxian stated in an interview, \u201cI used to try every possible trick in the world to drive Lan Zhan mad! It was no wonder that he hated me back then.\u201d We are not sure about the hate part, because looking at them now, Lan Wangji clearly did not \u2018hate\u2019 him.\u00a0 An interview with Nie Huiasang, the popular stylist and also a school mate of theirs said \u201cLan Wangji and Wei Wuxian were always down on each other\u2019s throat. We all thought they were rivals.\u201d Academic rivalry or more like unresolved sexual tension\u2026..</p>\n<p>Also</p>\n<p>Enemies to Friends to Lovers, anyone?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, they both attended the same schools and colleges. But fan will be delighted to know that Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were also lab partners! \u201cWei Ying is the reason I failed a semester in Chemistry.\u201d Lan Wangji admitted in a talk show. One can only imagine what other kinds of trouble Wei Wuxian got Lan Wangji into!</p>\n<p>\u2026and there was only one bed. <strike>Just kidding</strike> but Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian shared a dorm together back in their highschool days and despite there being two beds, rumour has it that Wangxian often shared one bed together.</p>\n<p>Oh, you read that correctly. Recently Lan Wangji confirmed in a tweet that he fell in love with Wei Wuxian at the age 15. But we all know that Wangxian got together only three years prior, when they were both 22. Lan Wangji, bless his pure heart, pined for Wei Wuxian for seven years straight.</p>\n<p>And apparently the pining was not one sided, Wei Wuxian with an interview for <em>TheGossips </em>confirmed as such</p>\n<p>(<em>Excerpt from TheGossips Magzine: </em>\u201cI knew what Lan Zhan and I shared was more than friendship but I couldn\u2019t place a name to that feeling. The idea of being in love with that man back then was\u2026new and terrifying. <em>[He laughs]</em> I\u2019m glad Lan Wangji confessed when he did; otherwise it would have taken me another five years to do so!)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji made his debut as a singer <em>and </em>actor in the same year as Wei Wuxian with the same series! <em>The thrilling adventures of Hanguang-jun and Yiling Laozu </em>directed by none other than <em>the </em>Lan Qiren, also Lan Wangji\u2019s uncle was an immediate hit, the dynamic between our two heroes both on-screen and off-screen was too hard for the fans to ignore and thus came the emergence of Wangxian shippers. The series had a particular scene where Hanguang-jun and the Yiling Laozu kiss, and that my folks was the first time wangxian ever kissed! Years later during the celebration of the 5 Year anniversary of the show, Wei Wuxian said, \u201dThe kiss was awkward but it also made me realize my feelings for him. Hahaha, I definitely wanted to kiss him again after that.\u201d\u00a0 Unfortunately we will never see this dynamic coupe on screen together again as Lan Wangji mentioned that acting was not his forte and he wants to focus on his music career.</p>\n<p>Like really\u2026..At the age of fifteen, during the mid-autumn festival, when they won their first awards together, at their first red carpet when they were each other\u2019s dates\u2026.like the opportunites were endless.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MORE LIKE THIS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> <u>10 times Wangixan were Relationship goals</u> </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> <u>\u00a0</u> </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> <u>Wangxian PDA: Real or fake?
